1
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:48,753
I'd like to make a bonfire
of the whole blinking lot of them.

2
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:52,882
That's all they're good for.
Now, not even that.

3
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:57,189
They've been shot up so much they ain't
worth the blinking petrol to set them afire.

4
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,390
Hold on, my lad. That's the king's property
you're talking about.

5
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:04,025
- I know, sergeant, but look...
- I've looked. So has everybody else.

6
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,798
- What about it?
- Well, what about it?

7
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,100
Don't muck it.
Mend it and shut your mouth.

8
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,602
What about A Flight?

9
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:15,037
There's the major still stargazing.
That's what about it.

10
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:17,816
Headquarters, sir.

11
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:24,949
- Hello. 59th Squadron.
- <i>Hello, Brand?</i>

12
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,990
- Yes, this is Brand.
- <i>What is the delay?</i>

13
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,152
- <i>Has A Flight returned yet?</i>
- No, A Flight is not back yet.

14
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,797
<i>They should be back before now.</i>

15
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:35,059
You send them out on a job
and expect them back in no time at all.

16
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:36,759
- What?
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

17
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:40,236
- <i>We have a bad connection.</i>
- Yes, yes, yes. I can hear you.

18
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:43,069
<i>Next time we'll get someone else.</i>
<i>We can't depend on you.</i>

19
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:46,337
Oh, you'll get others to do it next time?
That'll be splendid.

20
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:49,004
- <i>You do not seem to be giving cooperation.</i>
- Yes, sir.

21
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:52,345
- <i>After all, this is a war.</i>
- We've done every job you dig up for us.

22
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,454
If our men can't do it, who can?
They're the finest in France...

23
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,887
<i>If necessary, we'll transfer you</i>
<i>to a less important position.</i>

24
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,823
<i>Perhaps you can be taught</i>
<i>to obey orders as they are given.</i>

25
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:03,826
- Right.
- <i>Is that clear?</i>

26
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,658
Right, sir.

27
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,734
- Here.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:16,641
- Officious, overdressed brass hat.
- He thinks the 59th can't do it, huh?

29
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,803
The 59th can do anything
he can think up.

30
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,744
You know what this place is?

31
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,181
It's a slaughterhouse and I'm the butcher.

32
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,911
No use calling your names, Brand.

33
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:30,113
- Duty is something you learn...
- Duty?

34
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:36,022
Do you realize how many men we've lost
this last fortnight? Do you?

35
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,857
- Yes.
- Sixteen.

36
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,522
- More than a man a day.
- Yes.

37
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,794
And here's A Flight
out on another rotten show.

38
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:52,778
Seven fine boys. Three of them
first time out, first time over the lines.

39
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:55,414
If half of them get back, we'll be lucky.

40
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,983
It is a rotten job, Brand,
but you mustn't let it get you.

41
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:01,382
They just got to say,
"Bombers after a bridge.

42
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,422
Go up and protect them."
You say, "Fine. Right. Cheerio."

43
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:08,617
You send up planes that have been shot
to pieces, stuck together with spit and glue.

44
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:14,631
Do our boys argue? Do they complain?
Never. They just say, "Right." And go up.

45
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,895
- And go up and do it.
- They do.

46
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,666
Here they are.

47
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:28,278
That's one.

48
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,092
Five.

49
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:55,934
Five out of seven.

50
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,629
That's it.

51
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,784
- Hello, sergeant.
- Sir, you've been in something this time.

52
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,620
- Shrapnel?
- Yes. Nearly blew the ship over.

53
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,763
Yeah, my word... Look here, sir,
not 10 inches from your seat.

54
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,262
I needed that 10 inches, sergeant.

55
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,327
Oh, or every single ship...

56
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:02,533
- How'd you like it, Scott-o?
- All right. Are you intact?

57
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,973
- Yes, I think so.
- It was a hot one, wasn't it?

58
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,806
- Pretty warm.
- Who did we lose?

59
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,572
Blane and Machen.

60
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,841
Gonna lose Hollister, too,
by the look of it.

61
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,475
Don't take it to heart too much, sir.
We all gotta go some time, sir.

62
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,781
- Poor kid. Machen was his best friend.
- Yeah.

63
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,219
Let's go up.

64
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:26,994
I was telling him we all gotta go.

65
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,601
Sorry, but he went quickly.
He didn't feel any pain.

66
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,034
- Bobby Machen.
- Come on, Court.

67
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,565
Come on.

68
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,921
- A good stiff brandy, Bott.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:56,619
- Who was it, Blane?
- Blane, yes.

70
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,855
- Machen?
- And Machen. Blane and Machen.

71
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,297
- Here you are, captain.
- Thank you, Bott.

72
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,503
- Have you seen Tim?
- Here a moment ago, sir.

73
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:10,202
- Mr. Blane and Mr. Machen, sir?
- That's right, Bott.

74
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,674
Too bad, sir.
And the first time over the lines.

75
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,009
Hollister, have a drink, old man?

76
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:22,017
No, no, l... I couldn't. Thank you.

77
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,523
What he needs is a cup of tea
and a nice lie down.

78
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:29,525
- A little headache powder...
- Quiet, you.

79
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:30,924
Just a suggestion.

80
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,332
You'd better come on down
and have a drink.

81
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,403
Bobby Machen.
He didn't come back, Court.

82
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,442
He didn't come back.

83
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,881
It couldn't have been Bobs.
It was burning.

84
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,244
- No, it couldn't have been Bobs.
- Steady. Here.

85
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,352
- Drink?
- No, I don't want it.

86
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,081
Come on. Sit down.

87
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,657
Look, get that into you.
You'll feel better.

88
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:01,760
Come on, bottoms up.

89
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,493
Better?

90
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:14,696
Look. Poor old Bobby.
Look at the...

91
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,304
You can pack his things later.

92
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,577
They didn't even give him time
to unpack.

93
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,275
You're from Harrogate, aren't you?

94
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,749
I used to have an aunt
that lived there.

95
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,913
When I was a kid, they used to send me
down to stay with her.

96
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,955
She was a funny old dame.

97
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:36,527
She used to have one of those great,
enormous ear trumpets...

98
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,108
- Hollister.
- Oh, where's Courtney?

99
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,746
- He's up there with him.
- Oh, there you are.

100
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,313
The C.o. Wants to see you.

101
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:59,042
He does? Right.

102
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:01,619
Step into another world
and speak of lighter things?

103
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,415
- Very good idea.
- What'll you have?

104
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,989
Oh, the usual.

105
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,966
- Yes?
- We got to the bridge.

106
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,365
The bombers scored a direct hit
and wiped it out.

107
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,134
They did?

108
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,972
We lost two men.

109
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,410
Blane and Machen.

110
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,580
Oh, you did?

111
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,120
Yes. That's all.

112
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,652
Wait a minute, Courtney.

113
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,657
You were responsible for those new men.

114
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:50,029
Yes, that's right.
I was responsible for those two men.

115
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,000
We ran into that Heinie nest
on purpose.

116
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,163
We sent the Huns an engraved invitation
to come over and meet us.

117
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,502
- Yes?
- We were outnumbered...

118
00:09:57,677 --> 00:10:00,578
...and forced to fly low.
We had to fight our way out.

119
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:05,449
All right, suppose you did.
You could have been more cautious.

120
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,451
Cautious? You don't think I enjoyed losing
those boys, do you?

121
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,589
Getting them burned up,
all over France.

122
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:14,318
Sending them up in crates that should
have been on the scrap heap months ago.

123
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:18,362
That's right. Now, tell me.
Tell me what's on your mind.

124
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:21,762
That I'm a murderer, I ought to give you
better planes, men, fliers.

125
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,424
Say it, why don't you say it?

126
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:27,167
I'm not blaming anyone, Brand.

127
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,207
Why don't they chuck it?
It isn't funny anymore.

128
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,507
You know what it is?
Brand is just about at the end of his tether.

129
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,049
His nerves are frayed out.
It's the responsibility.

130
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:42,210
Running the show on the ground
when he'd infinitely rather be...

131
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:46,324
...up there in a plane himself,
personally taking all the risks.

132
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,592
For a chap of Brand's temperament...

133
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:54,494
...a dangerous job is much easier
than sending other fellows into danger.

134
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:59,104
He has nothing against Courtney.
He relies on him and he needs him.

135
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:03,231
- It's a funny war.
- No, not, not awfully.

136
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,980
I say, Courtney,
do you remember Griggs in the 37th?

137
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,819
- Yes.
- He was killed the other day near Allensville.

138
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,485
- Pulled the wings off an FE.
- Was he? I hadn't heard.

139
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,824
I'll never forget Griggie's first solo flight.

140
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,660
He pancaked on top of that house...

141
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,667
...found himself upside down,
looking into the girl's bedroom.

142
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:36,434
Yes. And she opened the window,
and bashed him on the nose.

143
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,845
You're not gonna play
that again, are you?

144
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:42,675
- It's a beautiful thing.
- It smells.

145
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:45,647
- Makes me want to cry.
- Yeah, me too.

146
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:49,379
Who did that?
You do not appreciate good music.

147
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,116
- Hey.
- Hey!

148
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:57,285
- Furniture, the furniture.
- I've gotta deal with these things...

149
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,931
- I'll take that.
- Please, no.

150
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,992
I told you you'd get hurt.
Now, why don't you sit down.

151
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,965
- Scotty. Scotty.
- Hey. Hey.

152
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,849
Come in.

153
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,281
Here, give it to me.

154
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,619
- Anything more, sir?
- No.

155
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:35,190
- Is there an E in "courageously," Brand?
- Courageously? Yes, of course.

156
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,228
I'm just sending a letter of sympathy
to Mrs. Machen.

157
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,161
I'm puzzled over that word.
It has an unfamiliar look.

158
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,734
Unfamiliar?
Well, you've written it often enough.

159
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:47,134
Don't you think our letters of sympathy
are becoming stereotyped?

160
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:50,639
I think I'll try and alter my prose style
and humanize this one.

161
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,279
Well, no matter how you write it...

162
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,775
...it'll break her heart just the same.

163
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:11,387
Hooray! Hooray!

164
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,768
"Hurrah for the next man who dies."

165
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:21,634
Bluffing as though death doesn't mean
anything. Trying to live for the moment...

166
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,571
...as if they didn't care a hang
about going up tomorrow...

167
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,307
And never coming back.

168
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,315
Because they don't come back...

169
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,655
...do they?

170
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,054
No, but new ones keep coming up.

171
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,661
It goes on and on.

172
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:51,964
- Hello, yes, 59th.
- <i>Brand?</i>

173
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:54,197
- This is Brand.
- <i>We have a nice job for you.</i>

174
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,307
A good one this time. I understand.

175
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:00,536
<i>Starting tomorrow you are to patrol</i>
<i>every two hours starting at 5, ask Emma.</i>

176
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,511
Wait a minute, sir.
Where do I get the men to do it?

177
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,447
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yes? Yes, sir.

178
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,679
- <i>Replacements move up tonight.</i>
- Replacements?

179
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,688
- Oh, they're on their way here now.
- <i>They report before dawn.</i>

180
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,450
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Send the new men up.</i>

181
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,595
- Yes.
- <i>They've had enough training.</i>

182
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,491
<i>Have you get that?</i>

183
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,463
Yes, of course, of course, sir.

184
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,693
Of course we'll do it.
If we must, we must.

185
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,895
- <i>The 59th...</i>
- Wait a minute, sir.

186
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:34,210
- Lf any of them get back from a job...
- <i>Speak louder. I can't hear you.</i>

187
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,315
If any of them get back from a job like that
it'll be a miracle.

188
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:41,749
- <i>Well, do the best you can.</i>
- Yes, sir. All right.

189
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,856
- <i>Goodbye.</i>
- Goodbye.

190
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,985
A new something nasty, huh?

191
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,734
Four new youngsters
are on their way here.

192
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:02,297
They'll get their baptism in the morning
with Courtney, who'll have to take them up.

193
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,802
Strange how a man like that
can annoy you and yet...

194
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,173
...keep you worried to death
about his safety.

195
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,747
It's not strange. It's the responsibility.

196
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,749
Haven't you seen a mother
risk her life to save her child...

197
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,685
...then spanks it soundly for getting itself
into danger? Of course you have.

198
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:24,762
When I order him to take up replacements
again, you watch him.

199
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,525
He's going to stand there looking holes
clean through me. You watch him.

200
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,498
Then he'll say, "Right." Like that.

201
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,264
- Right.
- Come along, sir. Let's get to it.

202
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,930
One day you'll find my plane...

203
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,508
Turn that thing off, will you, Esmund?
Thanks.

204
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:43,012
Quiet, lads. Attention there, please.
Orders for tomorrow morning.

205
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,774
A Flight.

206
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,646
Come on, there, hurry up.
Stand to attention.

207
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:51,079
A Flight on the early show
over Baulay Sector.

208
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,350
We're making an advance
5:00 in the morning.

209
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,324
We're to patrol four kilometers
behind to the enemy lines.

210
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,788
Strafe enemy reinforcements
and munition convoys.

211
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:04,134
When the barrage starts, B Flight will cover
our observation ships and artillery.

212
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,835
You'll take up the details
amongst yourselves later on.

213
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,376
That's all. Thank you, gentlemen.
Good night.

214
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,341
Dismissed, gentlemen.

215
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:24,219
All right, what is it?

216
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,858
A Flight has only got five man.

217
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,756
- More replacements are on their way up.
- More replacements.

218
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,057
Yes. They'll be here first thing
in the morning.

219
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:36,292
You're telling me that I'm expected
to go out on a job like that...

220
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:39,029
...with two inexperienced men?
- Those are the orders.

221
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:42,472
Right.

222
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,007
- What?
- He said "right" just as you said he would.

223
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,458
I'm glad I'm not in A Flight.

224
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:12,737
Speaking of A Flight, where's Scotty?

225
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,570
He's down here.

226
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,375
Look at that. A couple of drinks
and he goes out like a light.

227
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:23,379
Hey, Scotty, come on.
Time to tucky uppy now, Master Scott.

228
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:26,143
No sign of life. Wait a minute. Here.

229
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:30,379
Come along, Master Scott.
Time to tucky uppy.

230
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:33,150
<i>Rain, rain, go away, come back...</i>

231
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,054
Come on.

232
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:37,058
- Up you come.
- Good morning, all.

233
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,027
- Say good night to the gentlemen now.
- Good night.

234
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,531
- That's right. Now to these gentlemen.
- Good night.

235
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,431
Good night, gentlemen. Alley-oop.

236
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:48,095
- Say good night to the gentlemen now.
- Good night.

237
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,270
Way to go, Scotty.

238
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,045
I've never heard of anyone like you.

239
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,482
Couple of drinks
and you get as fuzzy as an owl.

240
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,554
You can't even keep your eyes open.

241
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:06,213
A couple of drinks?
Maybe four, maybe eight.

242
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,860
Who knows? Who cares? Who...?

243
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,519
Oh, here are my piebald pajamas.

244
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:14,257
I will now discard
the lower half as usual.

245
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,401
I have spots in front of my eyes, Court.

246
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,935
- Well, what do you expect?
- Oh, these?

247
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:23,006
These were a going-away present
from a little froufrou.

248
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,268
- Who, who?
- Froufrou.

249
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:29,972
Froufrou, froufrou. Froufrou was sweet.

250
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:38,383
What's the matter with you?
You're moping about something.

251
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:41,856
Oh, No. No, I was just
thinking of Hollister.

252
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:45,391
It's pretty rough losing your best friend,
isn't it?

253
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:49,092
- And he's gone.
- Go on, go to bed.

254
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:54,295
Machen, he was just a baby.

255
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,941
Couldn't have been older
than that brother of yours.

256
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:59,477
Oh, little Donnie.

257
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,606
Oh, I hope this war is over
by the time he gets out of school.

258
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,272
I haven't seen him in so long...

259
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:08,443
...I probably won't even recognize him
when I do see him.

260
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:13,920
Court, I've got awful opening and shutting
trouble with my head. Awful.

261
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:17,585
All that seems pretty far away, doesn't it?
Home and all that sort of thing.

262
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,731
My head seems awfully far away.

263
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,461
Imagine being at home now,
peaceful and quiet.

264
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,628
Nothing to worry about.

265
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:30,502
Nothing to do except get up in the morning
and laze around.

266
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,538
Marvelous.

267
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:36,703
Be able to know that you'll come back
to your own bed at night.

268
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,901
- I'm sorry, sir.
- What's the time, sergeant?

269
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,876
Nearly 5:00, sir.
Dawn's just coming up.

270
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,812
- How's the weather?
- A bit cloudy, sir.

271
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,145
Where's that honey
you're always talking about?

272
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,345
Honey you could have had
right on this table.

273
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,456
Could I get anyone to help
with them bees?

274
00:21:18,624 --> 00:21:20,819
Up they'll go
with their lives in their hands...

275
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:22,824
...but will one of them face a bee? No.

276
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:26,226
- It's a phenomena, sir. Phenomena.
- You're very good with the chicken.

277
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:28,389
How is it you could do nothing
with bees?

278
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,331
I put a sack over me head
as Mr. Scott recommended...

279
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,698
...and out I goes to be friendly...
- Scotty!

280
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:37,205
Out I goes to be friendly like,
I start buzzing back to them, like:

281
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:38,741
- How?
- Morning, Mr. Scott.

282
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,277
- Oh, good morning, sergeant.
- Good morning...

283
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:47,616
oh, good morning, Mr. Scott.
It's a beautiful morning, Mr. Scott.

284
00:21:47,786 --> 00:21:50,084
- Have an egg, Mr. Scott.
- Off from the nest, sir.

285
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,553
Coffee, Mr. Scott?
Don't stand there gaping.

286
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:57,526
Bring a couple of headache powders
on toast. Mr. Scott, a little coffee.

287
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,555
What's that singing outside?

288
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,231
Replacements coming up, sir.

289
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,302
- Send them in.
- Very good, sir.

290
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:08,269
Court, have you ever seen mice
on roller skates?

291
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,340
On bicycles, never on skates, old man.

292
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,906
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sergeant.

293
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,913
Right this way, please, gentlemen.

294
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:23,118
That's all right. We'll look after
your luggage. Just follow me.

295
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,459
- This way, gentlemen, please.
- Here they are.

296
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:30,118
Will you wait here, please, gentlemen?

297
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,734
- The replacements, sir.
- They get younger every day.

298
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:41,963
If this goes on much longer,
they'll be coming in perambulators.

299
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:44,302
Come on, fix them up.

300
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:59,547
Gentlemen, Captain Courtney.

301
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,421
- Good morning, gents.
- Good morning, sir.

302
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:07,156
Russell, second lieutenant, sir,
reporting from the pool for duty.

303
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:10,460
I see. How do you do, Russell?
Nice to have you with us.

304
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:13,764
- At ease. We don't have any formality.
- Thank you, sir.

305
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:15,429
- What's your name?
- Burt, sir.

306
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:16,869
Burt, eh? Burt what?

307
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,636
- Henry Burt.
- Oh, I see. How do you do?

308
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,040
- And you?
- Cleaver, sir.

309
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,737
Hello, Cleaver.

310
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:25,042
- And what's your name?
- Smythe, sir.

311
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,651
Hello, Smythe. Nice to have you with us.

312
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,880
- How many hours have you fellows had?
- I've had 18, sir.

313
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:33,750
Eighteen. And you?

314
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,019
- Thirteen, sir.
- Fifteen, sir.

315
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:41,189
- And how many have you had?
- Seven and a half, sir.

316
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:43,129
Seven and a half, eh?

317
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,027
I'll take Russell and Cleaver.
Get your things on.

318
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,538
- We're going to strafe trenches.
- Now, sir?

319
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,268
- You won't have time for breakfast.
- We've had it, sir.

320
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:55,607
- When do we go, sir?
- You'll go soon enough. Get some coffee.

321
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,180
- Morning, Hollister.
- Morning.

322
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,944
- Breakfast waiting for you, sir.
- I don't want breakfast.

323
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,851
- I think you better have some breakfast.
- I don't want any breakfast, thank you.

324
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:16,391
Have some coffee or breakfast
or drinks or something.

325
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,035
- Kirby, bring some cups.
- Coming.

326
00:24:18,203 --> 00:24:20,535
- Bott. The usual.
- Coming, sir.

327
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:26,301
Thank you.
Hollister, have a little breakfast.

328
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:28,672
- I'm just giving a little nourishment.
- I see.

329
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,714
I should explain
that this little spotted number on my left...

330
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:34,216
...goes under the name of Scotty.
He's in A Flight.

331
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,685
- First today.
- Nice fellow, but he drinks too much.

332
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,118
Have some of this.

333
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,936
Come on, old chap.

334
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,031
Good luck.

335
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,407
Scotty.

336
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,672
Come on, now.
What are you doing asleep?

337
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,149
Come on, wake up.
Will you come or must l...?

338
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,778
- No, wait. Hold on.
- Come on. Come on then. Quick.

339
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,219
They can wait for me.

340
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:15,215
Go.

341
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:18,220
- There you are, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

342
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,524
Russell and Cleaver
will take four and five.

343
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:24,066
- This way.
- Don't forget to stick to my tail. Good luck.

344
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,636
You. You're an old hand now.
We're counting on you.

345
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,365
- Right, sir.
- Better watch him.

346
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,009
- Don't forget, you're protecting the tail.
- Yeah.

347
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:36,045
And watch yourself too, old man.
I don't want be left holding the bottle.

348
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:40,782
Thank you.
Is everything all right, Mac?

349
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:42,545
- Everything's all right, sir.
- Fine.

350
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,349
- Switch off.
- All right. Spin it.

351
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:15,550
Has the officer got any papers
that might give information to the enemy?

352
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,245
No.

353
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,326
Has the officer got any papers
that might give information to the enemy?

354
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:25,724
No.

355
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,595
Beat us to it
just by a few more flying hours.

356
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:06,500
Lucky devils.

357
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:33,025
"And mother and I talk about how much
you would love the old rock path now.

358
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:37,533
Last Sunday's rain
brought up the best primroses."

359
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:40,461
Primroses.

360
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:45,899
"Jenny's had seven darling puppies."

361
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:49,411
Well, well, the rain seems
to be accomplishing many blessings.

362
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,709
Think of it, Brand, a litter of seven.

363
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:56,918
"We'll have to give most of them away...

364
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:00,058
...because the milk rationing
is very strict now...

365
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:03,388
...and we won't be able
to buy enough for them."

366
00:28:03,562 --> 00:28:05,325
Buy enough. Well, that's strange.

367
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:09,934
I always thought puppies were provided
with private rations by their mother.

368
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,660
Even England's getting muddled
with this war.

369
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:18,735
It'd be awfully nice if we had a dog
around here in the mornings...

370
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,344
...to come in and cheer us up.

371
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:22,878
Here.

372
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,143
Come on, fella. Come on here.

373
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:28,150
Mind your muddy feet. Come on.

374
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,680
- What you doing?
- The dog.

375
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,524
Dog? What dog? Where?

376
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:41,090
No, I say it would be nice if we had a dog
to come in here in the mornings...

377
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,666
...to sort of cheer us up, you know?

378
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,238
I thought it would be sort of cozy,
you know?

379
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,692
Not Mr. Scott, sir?

380
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:56,965
There were two Boches after me.
Scotty was trying to help me.

381
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:23,897
Yes, Courtney?

382
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:26,830
We fought off the counterattack
for an hour...

383
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,563
...and they found us.

384
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:32,538
We lost three men. Russell...

385
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:36,541
...Cleaver, Scott.

386
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:19,948
I'm sorry about Mr. Scott, sir.

387
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,649
Yes.

388
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,798
To him.

389
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:40,639
I'll drink to that.

390
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,107
To Scott-o.

391
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:46,777
Sleep tight.

392
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,086
What happened, Courtney?

393
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:58,093
Well...

394
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:04,061
We were strafing that convoy
right after the first barrage...

395
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:06,770
...trying to get out under a cloud bank.

396
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:10,605
The Jerries came down on us like that:

397
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,369
Poor little Cleaver went first.
I don't think he even fired a shot.

398
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:17,913
Then Russell must have gone
at about the same time. I didn't see.

399
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,379
Then Hollister.

400
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:21,985
Well?

401
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,351
- Something must have happened.
- He funked?

402
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:30,591
Yes, he did a bit. He got in a jam...

403
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:32,593
What?

404
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:36,190
And Scott-o went after him,
to help him out.

405
00:32:37,202 --> 00:32:40,899
Jerry got on his tail
and shot him down out of patrol.

406
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,130
You sure?

407
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,435
Yes, I saw it.
It was right underneath me.

408
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:49,102
There was nothing I could do.
He had his tail surfaces all shot away.

409
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:52,745
He caught in a spin.

410
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:58,048
As he went down, he waved goodbye.

411
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:01,385
Where'd he'd go down?

412
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,427
I don't know, somewhere behind our lines.
I went after that Jerry bullheaded.

413
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:09,966
- Did you get him?
- No, I put a bullet in his motor.

414
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,166
He came down
behind our lines somewhere.

415
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,335
Behind our lines?

416
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:17,173
Hi there, fellas. Turn that off, please.

417
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:22,041
No, no. Play it. Go ahead. Play it.
What's it matter?

418
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:25,444
You fellas don't appreciate good music.
Play it.

419
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,983
Maybe Scotty will hear it.

420
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,716
Funny if you really thought he could,
wouldn't it?

421
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,489
He was wearing
those bright piebald pajamas.

422
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,596
Remember, the one's with the spots?

423
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:43,133
Lt'll be funny if he shows up
before the devil in those.

424
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:45,292
- Right, bring him in.
- Great fellow, Scotty.

425
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,439
You may send the car back.
Just wait here a moment, Henderson.

426
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,267
- What's all this?
- Pardon me, sir.

427
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:53,605
An artillery car brought in a German.
One moment, Captain Henderson.

428
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:56,440
- Who brought him down?
- They say the leader of A Flight.

429
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:58,514
That's you, Captain Courtney.

430
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,383
Steady, old fellow.

431
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:06,919
- Good morning, sir. I have my prisoner here.
- Good morning.

432
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,128
Hauptmann von Mueller.

433
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,600
Hauptmann von Mueller, Major Brand.

434
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,532
And Captain Courtney.

435
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:32,706
Phipps, tell him Courtney
is the man that brought him down.

436
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,232
He says he's delighted to meet you.

437
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,284
Oh, sorry.

438
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,281
- So sorry?
- Sorry. Yeah. Will you have a drink?

439
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,690
Yes? Come on.

440
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:23,760
Bott, drinks.

441
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:26,096
What will you have, whiskey,
cognac, champagne?

442
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,636
- Nothing but the best.
- Cognac.

443
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,137
- Cognac.
- Cognac.

444
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:31,537
Hello, Hollister. Have a drink.

445
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,973
- This is Hollister, Captain von...
- von Mueller.

446
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:42,618
Sorry.

447
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,455
- Sorry.
- We are sorry.

448
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:48,324
So...

449
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,095
He wants us drink to the day
they'll blow us out of the skies.

450
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:57,666
0h, no, no, no. Can't do that.

451
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:01,566
Ask him if he'll drink a toast to the dead.

452
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:16,320
To the dead.

453
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,564
- That's very nice.
- Sorry.

454
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,139
No, no.

455
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:13,209
Thank you very much indeed.
Very nice. Thank you.

456
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:16,973
Do you think you could manage
to say "the" next man "that" dies...

457
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,140
...not "zee" next man "zat" dies?

458
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,785
- The.
- The. That's it.

459
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,558
Very nice.

460
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:39,635
Very good.

461
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:54,141
You can laugh, joke with him,
a man who murdered your best friend!

462
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,413
- He's dead! You know that, don't you?
- Shut up!

463
00:37:57,588 --> 00:38:00,056
So is Blane. And Machen, my best friend!
They're dead!

464
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:03,057
They aren't coming back.
They aren't coming back anymore.

465
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,216
Shut up.

466
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:07,859
I believe you've forgotten Scott-o already.

467
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,611
Brandy, Bott.

468
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:33,086
He wants to know if Hollister flies.

469
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,788
Tell him yes.
Off the handle more times than not.

470
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,326
Brandy, Bott!
"Pack Up Your Troubles."

471
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,503
Scotty!

472
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:56,474
Scotty!

473
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,688
Where did...?
Where did you get the champagne?

474
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:08,985
I don't know.

475
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,791
You... You...

476
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:32,145
You know, we thought you'd gone west.
Tell us, what happened?

477
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:35,808
Well, the last thing I remember
was pancaking into a trench...

478
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,648
...and seeing my wings fold up.

479
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:40,757
Then I woke up with a bump on my head...
Feel it?

480
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,686
- And a stretcher bearer
pouring rum down my...

481
00:39:43,861 --> 00:39:46,853
- You should have that rum.
- You didn't have any, did you?

482
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:49,522
Just a couple of drops.
I stopped on the way back...

483
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:53,660
...and I brought these.
Come on, open them up! Open them up!

484
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,831
Oh, what's that?

485
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,843
Oh, that's the man
that brought you down.

486
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:04,538
- Who?
- Introduce him, will you, Phipps?

487
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:29,173
- What does he say?
- I don't know.

488
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,671
He wants him to have a drink.

489
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,278
Oh, drink! Drink. Bott, drinks!

490
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:37,237
Oh! Don't waste it!

491
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:28,025
- Didn't understand a word. Did you?
- I took German in school, but...

492
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,930
So did I, but I can't understand
the way these foreigners speak it.

493
00:41:35,406 --> 00:41:36,668
Thanks, old man.

494
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:43,305
Sir, there's a driver out here
named Flaherty.

495
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:45,574
- He's waiting for you, sir.
- Tell him to wait.

496
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,775
- I've got a car and chauffeur outside.
- What?

497
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:50,352
Gonna take me
on a personally conducted tour...

498
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,512
...of all the inns and taverns of France.

499
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,284
Wonderful. You wanna come, Fritzie?

500
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:02,694
Gentlemen, keep the war going, please.
We are going out to roll in a few gutters.

501
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,357
Bravo.

502
00:42:08,372 --> 00:42:11,102
Flaherty! Flaherty, where's my horse?
Bring it on.

503
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,039
Boys, get comfy.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

504
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,476
Courtney! He can't go, he's a prisoner.

505
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,308
Oh, but he can sing.

506
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:20,677
Oh, well, goodbye, Fritzie. Goodbye.

507
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:23,752
Come on, Court, get in.
This is Mr. Courtney, Mr. Flaherty.

508
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,651
He's the best singer...
Best driver on the Western front.

509
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:29,258
- Coming up. Coming up.
- Get the captain to sing.

510
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,792
Oh, he's terrific.

511
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:54,982
- Bring him in. I want to talk to him.
- Yes, sir. Come.

512
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,533
Road hog!

513
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:22,209
I'm not disputing that.
Military police are for that purpose. What?

514
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,713
- <i>You should put them under arrest.</i>
- I do not think it's a good idea.

515
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:27,111
- <i>Why not?</i>
- Why?

516
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:29,515
Well, because I need them here,
that's why.

517
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,985
- What? They did?
- <i>Some girl brought a minister down here.</i>

518
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:35,625
- She did?
- <i>Wants to marry both of them.</i>

519
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,125
The Frenchman? His sweetheart?

520
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:39,729
<i>Put him down in a well.</i>

521
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,258
- Oh, they did?
- <i>They're on their way back.</i>

522
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:48,462
Oh, they are? Why didn't you say so before?
I'll discipline them.

523
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,573
All right, thank you, Yes. Goodbye.

524
00:43:50,741 --> 00:43:54,233
Drunk as lords and raising Cain,
and you laugh, you old fool.

525
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:57,210
Well, really, you know,
confidentially, Brand, I envy them.

526
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:59,281
Don't you? Now, tell the truth.

527
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,251
Apparently, they've put some French girl's
sweetheart down a well or something.

528
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:07,220
If I didn't need them here,
I'd leave them to the military...

529
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:09,086
Wait a minute, there's B Flight.

530
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,550
More trouble. Come along.

531
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,393
This way, sir. Come along, sir.

532
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:52,798
- Squires, what happened?
- Von Richter has moved in across the lines.

533
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,632
- Von Richter?
- We ran into one flight and then another.

534
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:58,866
There was nothing we could do.
Suddenly, the air was full of them.

535
00:44:59,043 --> 00:45:02,137
It is lucky to any of us got back.
They can really fly.

536
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:03,644
Many of them?

537
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:06,806
We were outnumbered four to one.
We didn't have a chance.

538
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:10,476
- Here. Now, take it easy.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:17,623
That's right. Get your tourniquet on there.

540
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,820
- What's wrong?
- Hello, Squires.

541
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:21,294
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

542
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:24,400
- How many men did you lose?
- Courtney, von Richter's over there.

543
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:27,662
That's gonna make things lively
as if it wasn't bad enough already.

544
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,534
- Who'd you lose, Squires?
- Well, Thornley and Murrell.

545
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,176
- Verdan and Hollister.
- Hollister?

546
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:36,541
- Four out of seven.
- Hollister. How did Hollister go?

547
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:39,080
- He was trying to help Thornley.
- He was?

548
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,774
- Yeah.
- I'm glad. Out like a man.

549
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:43,010
Get Captain Squires
to the medical officer.

550
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:47,146
- Courtney, you'd better come with me.
- Can you get the m. O? All right.

551
00:45:53,597 --> 00:45:55,497
- Duck, cover!
- Enemy plane.

552
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:57,566
Stay where you are, sir.

553
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,588
- Look, Courtney, boots.
- Wait. Don't touch those.

554
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,990
- They're all right. Let's look at them.
- They're all right.

555
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:27,596
What's that?

556
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:31,792
"One pair of trench boots
for the use of British flying officers.

557
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,960
You'll be safer on the ground.
Von Richter."

558
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:36,470
Give me those boots.
Give me those. I'll get that...

559
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,507
- I'll take care of these boots.
- Order.

560
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:41,142
Give me those boots, Courtney.

561
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:44,713
Now pay attention.
There are going to be no volunteer patrols.

562
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:47,942
Don't you realize these boots
are a trick to get you up in the air?

563
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,179
None of you is going to commit suicide
by going up alone.

564
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:53,316
Don't worry. You'll die soon enough.

565
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:56,324
But not a man leaves the ground
without my orders. Understand?

566
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:57,859
- Yes, sir.
- Come along, Phipps.

567
00:46:58,028 --> 00:46:59,359
Yes, sir.

568
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,999
About those boots, Court...

569
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:09,764
Yes, I was just thinking the same thing.

570
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:22,309
You can keep the boots. They don't fit.

571
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:04,485
Let her rip, Scott-o.

572
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,024
Oh, I can't see.

573
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,131
I can't see.

574
00:54:58,008 --> 00:55:00,169
We're in a right-hand spin. Pull her out.

575
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:02,312
But I can't see.

576
00:55:06,717 --> 00:55:09,777
That's it. Right forward. Left.

577
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:15,718
We're over our own lines, aren't we?

578
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:19,350
Yes, but the ground's just as hard here.

579
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:24,593
Look out. Here it comes.

580
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:33,533
Court, get me down.

581
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:36,910
Hello. Are you all right?

582
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,911
I'm fighting the wrong way.

583
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:41,642
Wait a minute. Look out for the petrol.

584
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:45,151
- Right.
- Right. Easy now, sir.

585
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,153
- Give me something, I can't see.
- Here you are.

586
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,192
Here's your scarf.

587
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:58,733
Well, we made it. We made it.

588
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:02,504
Mine is a farce.
They command themselves.

589
00:56:02,672 --> 00:56:05,197
- Orders don't mean anything. It's a circus.
- Remember...

590
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,343
I remember giving orders.
Give me my tunic.

591
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:09,843
- Yes, sir.
- Those orders have been disobeyed.

592
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:13,915
With Infantry or other branch, an officer
can keep discipline. What can I do?

593
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:16,746
All right, thank you.
They're laughing up their sleeves.

594
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,649
- Or dead.
- Yes, or dead.

595
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:23,191
No, they're not dead.
Courtney! Scott!

596
00:56:31,468 --> 00:56:33,902
- All right, you can go.
- Thank you, sir.

597
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:35,368
Good morning, gentlemen.

598
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:37,564
- Good morning, Phipps.
- Good morning, Phipps.

599
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,010
What do you fellows imagine
I'm here for?

600
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:44,272
To watch you turn the army
into a circus?

601
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:47,975
I've played fair, but this is organized
warfare not your own private feud.

602
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:51,018
You went out against von Richter
outnumbered four to one.

603
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:53,952
You fools, when we need every man
and every plane.

604
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:55,955
I'm not gonna stand for it any longer.

605
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:59,186
I've made out a report on the situation
for headquarters.

606
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,855
- Fifty-ninth.
- There'll be a court-martial.

607
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:04,091
Somebody's going to get hurt.
Give it to me.

608
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:05,894
All right, stand at ease.

609
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,297
- Hello. Hello.
- <i>Brand?</i>

610
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:08,995
- This is Brand.
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

611
00:57:09,172 --> 00:57:10,571
- What?
- <i>Splendid job.</i>

612
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,436
The drome was bombed?
What drome? Where?

613
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,909
<i>We've learned your squadron</i>
<i>blew the air base off the map. Nice work.</i>

614
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,072
- Here... Wait. Excuse me.
- <i>Splendid job of bombing the airdrome.</i>

615
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,013
- Destroyed it?
- <i>Yes, a perfect job.</i>

616
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:25,279
- Really?
- <i>Blew the whole place up.</i>

617
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:28,788
Yes, sir. Yes, yes.
From here, yes they did.

618
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:31,120
- <i>Did you send both flights?</i>
- Only two of them.

619
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:33,956
- <i>Only two ships? That's splendid.</i>
- What?

620
00:57:34,131 --> 00:57:38,192
<i>General Barranger has ordered your</i>
<i>immediate transfer to Wing. Are you there?</i>

621
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:41,929
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.
Would you mind repeating that again, sir?

622
00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:44,539
<i>Has ordered your immediate</i>
<i>transfer to Wing.</i>

623
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:46,903
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Appoint someone in your place.</i>

624
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:48,908
With pleasure. Right away, sir.

625
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,309
<i>We want more of this sort of thing.</i>

626
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:54,609
<i>We'll see that you are transferred</i>
<i>to a more important position.</i>

627
00:57:54,784 --> 00:57:57,446
- <i>Is that clear?</i>
- Thank you, sir, thank you.

628
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:06,727
Come on, fellas, come into my parlor.

629
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:14,804
- Oh, get me another glass, will you, Phipps?
- Yes, sir.

630
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:27,616
- Here, you are, Phipps. Courtney. Scott.
- Thank you.

631
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:29,274
- Thanks.
- And myself.

632
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:32,819
And now I've got you, Courtney.
I've got you where I want you.

633
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:35,583
So far, the war has been a personal
adventure for you.

634
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:37,590
Full of... and glory.

635
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:39,854
As an individual flier,
you've been admirable.

636
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,863
And you've evaded responsibility
with equally supreme skill.

637
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:47,527
Disobeyed orders, blamed me, accused me
of putting kids into canvas coffins.

638
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:51,936
Well, listen to this, my lad.
Headquarters liked your raid this morning.

639
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:58,712
They liked it so well
that they've appointed me up to Wing.

640
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:01,277
Excuse me, Phipps.

641
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,551
And before I go, I'm ordered to appoint
someone in my place.

642
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:16,358
- Here at my place at this little desk.
- What do you mean?

643
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,763
I mean that
that someone is going to be you.

644
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:22,894
See how you like it,
Mr. Squadron Commander Courtney.

645
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:24,438
Right.

646
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:28,568
- Goodbye, Phipps. I'll be writing to you.
- Goodbye, sir.

647
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:33,882
- Hello, 59th. Hold on.
- <i>59th?</i>

648
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:35,976
- Hello. Yes?
- <i>Hello, 59th. Hello.</i>

649
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:38,347
<i>Let me speak with</i>
<i>the commanding officer.</i>

650
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:40,614
It's for the commanding officer.

651
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,985
That's you, Captain Courtney.

652
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:52,768
- Hello?
- <i>Speak louder.</i>

653
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,164
- <i>I can't hear you.</i>
- Hello.

654
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:56,703
<i>At dawn tomorrow,</i>
<i>put both flights into the air.</i>

655
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,586
- What is it?
- That's his third bottle going in.

656
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:14,587
He won't listen to me.

657
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,026
- Let the infantry get demoralized.
- <i>We can't.</i>

658
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:29,297
No. I can't put planes over them, because
I haven't got anybody left to fly them.

659
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:32,100
- <i>You have no man left to fly them?</i>
- No. Replacements?

660
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:34,675
- Six of them, poor kids.
- <i>Never mind that.</i>

661
01:00:34,844 --> 01:00:38,007
Von Richter's shot us out of the air.
He's killed all our best men.

662
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:40,843
- <i>What do you expect us to do?</i>
- Green kids can't stop him.

663
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:43,713
- <i>They've had enough training.</i>
- He'll shoot them down.

664
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:46,412
<i>You have your orders.</i>
<i>Now see that you follow them out.</i>

665
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:47,817
Yes.

666
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:52,223
All right, it'll be done, but I tell you
they haven't got a chance on earth.

667
01:00:53,196 --> 01:00:57,326
Brass hats,
sitting up there in easy chairs.

668
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:00,696
- Trying to make excuses...
- Third of the bottle down the hatch.

669
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:03,896
- You'll have geese on your desk...
- All right, what?

670
01:01:04,074 --> 01:01:08,374
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute. I'm sorry, old chap.

671
01:01:08,845 --> 01:01:12,406
Scott-o, that's bad, isn't it?
I'm as jumpy as the dickens.

672
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,277
Oh, I get like that too.

673
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:18,080
You know, I can't get used to being
up there in front of that flight all alone.

674
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:22,486
- I miss you up there
- Do you? I miss it too.

675
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,060
- This is a rotten job.
- Well, somebody's got to do it.

676
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:28,663
But why me?
I'm supposed to be a flier, I think.

677
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:30,299
None better, my boy.

678
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:33,027
I heard a good story
from one of the mechanics just now.

679
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:37,071
- Two fishermen went out, three fisher...
- Not now, old chap. Do you mind?

680
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,939
I've been talking to headquarters.
We've got a rotten job ahead of us now.

681
01:01:42,112 --> 01:01:44,842
Do you remember Brand
used to call himself the executioner?

682
01:01:45,014 --> 01:01:47,812
Poor Brand. He was nearly half-witty
when he left this place.

683
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:51,442
Yes. I'm beginning to understand
a lot about him.

684
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:56,490
He's probably in Paris with a bottle
in one hand and a blond in the other...

685
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:03,389
Replacements.

686
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:05,534
More lambs for the slaughter.
Fix them up.

687
01:02:05,702 --> 01:02:09,263
- Make them as comfortable as you can.
- I will.

688
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:13,509
Oh, they're really young this time.

689
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:15,701
How many hours
have you actually had?

690
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:19,645
Hours? Nine to be precise.
That was at Hendon, of course.

691
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:21,477
I got my wings on a Longhorn.

692
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:23,983
Finished off in a good old Avro
all the way out.

693
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:26,384
An FE for me, though, any day.

694
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:28,888
- Donnie.
- Scotty.

695
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:32,392
- Where did you come from?
- Oh, Hendon.

696
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:34,890
Gents, this is my brother, Captain Scott.

697
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:39,593
- I thought you were in school.
- Not much. I had to get in this.

698
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:42,829
I went through ground-school
in precisely four weeks and two days.

699
01:02:44,074 --> 01:02:45,939
- You did, huh?
- Yes.

700
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:51,771
- Well, aren't you glad to see me?
- Yes. Of course I am.

701
01:02:51,948 --> 01:02:54,041
- This is my baby brother.
- How do you do, sir?

702
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:56,617
- How do you do, sergeant?
- Come on inside.

703
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:58,777
Attention.

704
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:02,223
I'm the skipper of A Flight.

705
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:05,793
Lieutenant Billings, sir,
reporting from the pool for duty.

706
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:09,498
Stand at ease, gentlemen.
There's no formality here.

707
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,492
Billings.

708
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:18,303
- Will you take care of these officers for me?
- Yes, sir.

709
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:23,034
- You've got a bar in here and everything.
- I suppose you drink now, do you?

710
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:26,046
I did have a couple coming over
on the boat. It made me sick.

711
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:27,740
- Good.
- I could try one with you.

712
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:29,179
No.

713
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:31,013
- Now, look here, Scotty.
- Or what?

714
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:34,350
Hold down on this baby stuff.
You're the big lad of the family...

715
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:37,357
...but I'm in this with you now,
officer-and-gentlemen stuff.

716
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:39,154
- How many hours have you had?
- Nine.

717
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:42,955
Nine.

718
01:03:44,801 --> 01:03:48,635
Oh, now, listen, Scotty. I went through
combat maneuvers without a hitch.

719
01:03:48,805 --> 01:03:50,670
You should have seen me.

720
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,640
I'm sure you did, Donnie. I'll show you
your room. You can share mine with me.

721
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:57,302
That's great. By the way,
isn't Court in command here?

722
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,448
- Yes.
- Well, can't we go and see him?

723
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:01,516
You'll see him soon enough. Come on.

724
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:05,719
Come on, old chap. Ready for orders?
Come on.

725
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:17,922
Attention.
Turn that thing off, will you, Aimes?

726
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:21,161
- Attention, men.
- Quiet, lads. Line up, please.

727
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:23,532
Orders for tomorrow morning.

728
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:28,936
Good evening, gentlemen.
There's no secrecy about these orders.

729
01:04:29,112 --> 01:04:32,673
GHQ has discovered that Fritz is making
a big push the day after tomorrow.

730
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:35,147
They've started minor advances already.

731
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:37,949
You're to patrol
the Mantez Woods Sector.

732
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:41,784
That's opposite the German 6th army.
You'll fly four patrols a day...

733
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,950
...which means that every man
will be in the air at dawn.

734
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:50,296
As usual, you've got the dirty work to do,
low flying, machine gunning infantry...

735
01:04:50,466 --> 01:04:54,766
...strafing supply trucks
and any shock troops they try to bring up.

736
01:04:54,938 --> 01:05:00,205
You're flying directly below von Richter's
patrols, so you better watch out.

737
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:02,977
- That's all.
- Court?

738
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:07,775
- Oh, may I say hello, sir?
- Donnie.

739
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:10,749
- Donnie Scott. Where did you spring from?
- Hendon.

740
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:12,888
Hendon?

741
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:14,551
You're...

742
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:19,552
- You're one of the replacements?
- Yes. I go up tomorrow, don't I?

743
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:23,092
Yes, you do.

744
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,360
Court, you're not sending him up
on patrol tomorrow. You can't do that.

745
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:30,199
Every man goes up tomorrow, Scott-o.

746
01:05:31,674 --> 01:05:34,165
If you think I'm taking him up,
you're crazy.

747
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:37,336
- Oh, but, listen, Scotty, I'm an excellent...
- oh, shut up.

748
01:05:37,747 --> 01:05:39,044
He's not going up.

749
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:44,448
- Be ready at dawn tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

750
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:54,721
Now, look here, Scotty...

751
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:00,831
You wait here.

752
01:06:03,973 --> 01:06:07,739
And you're the one that gapped to Brand
about sending green kids up to get killed.

753
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,435
Combat maneuvers. Ground-school.
He doesn't know.

754
01:06:10,613 --> 01:06:12,274
What chance would he have up there?

755
01:06:12,448 --> 01:06:16,111
He'll have as much chance as the others.
There can't be any exceptions.

756
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:19,187
Do you think I want to do this?
Those are the orders.

757
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:21,482
Oh, I know it's orders, Court.

758
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:25,094
Give me three days, two days.
Then I can get him up in the air...

759
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:28,822
...and teach him a few basic tricks.
At least he'll have a fighting chance.

760
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:30,431
He doesn't know anything.

761
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,228
Court, he can't even do a half-loop
and roll out.

762
01:06:33,403 --> 01:06:36,895
Do you hear that? He can't even roll out.
What good's he gonna be up there?

763
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:40,770
Do you think he's gonna bring down
any Boche plane? No.

764
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:44,110
They'll slaughter him, Court.

765
01:06:44,514 --> 01:06:45,913
Give me just a few days.

766
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:49,944
I said every man goes into the air
at dawn.

767
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:58,355
- I'm sorry, Scott-o, but there it is.
- I won't take him up.

768
01:07:00,563 --> 01:07:03,031
- Those are the orders.
- I don't care. I won't do it.

769
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:06,168
Those are the orders! Now, get out!

770
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:10,437
Get out.

771
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:14,533
Right.

772
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:34,421
- <i>Headquarters.</i>
- Hello, headquarters.

773
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:35,825
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yes.

774
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:38,762
This is 59th Squadron.
I want to talk to General Barranger.

775
01:07:38,935 --> 01:07:40,835
- <i>Is it urgent?</i>
- Yes, it's very urgent.

776
01:07:41,003 --> 01:07:42,368
Right.

777
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:53,275
- <i>Hello, hello.</i>
- Hello, yes? Yes, sir, Courtney.

778
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:56,384
I wouldn't have bothered,
but we've got an impossible situation.

779
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:59,953
- <i>Didn't your replacements reach you?</i>
- The replacements? Yes, they arrived.

780
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:01,852
- They're kids.
- <i>They've had training.</i>

781
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:04,185
They'll be no earthly use
against von Richter.

782
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,557
They haven't even the first idea
of combat tactics. Green kids.

783
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,960
- <i>We sent the best men we have.</i>
- Yes, I know, sir.

784
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:12,101
- But this job's...
- <i>It's the best we can do.</i>

785
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:14,099
- <i>What do you expect us to do?</i>
- Yes, sir.

786
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:15,999
- May I go on?
- <i>Well?</i>

787
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:19,630
If I could have a week with them,
a few days to teach them some things.

788
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:23,006
Show them a few tricks so they'll be
of use before they get killed...

789
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:27,240
<i>Don't bother me again about this.</i>
<i>Do as you're told. Goodbye.</i>

790
01:08:34,757 --> 01:08:39,091
I know it's against the rules and regulations
to burst into your sanctum sanctorum...

791
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:42,060
...but could I have just one word with you,
please, Court?

792
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,868
Of course you could, Donnie.

793
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:53,798
- Good old Court.
- I'm glad you came. What is it?

794
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:57,002
Well, I wish Scott-o and you
wouldn't scrap about me like this.

795
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,274
Honestly, I'm an excellent flier.
I've had combat maneuvers...

796
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:02,713
Combat maneuvers, have you?

797
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:06,780
Now, don't you laugh too.
Scotty lost his head completely.

798
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:09,322
- Oh, we all do here sometimes.
- Yes, of course.

799
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:12,120
Your nerves get jumpy.
A lot of fellas bunched together.

800
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:14,195
Scotty's responsible
for the other fliers.

801
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:16,831
When he sees me fly,
he won't worry then.

802
01:09:16,999 --> 01:09:20,992
It's not just a question of flying. You see,
you're gonna be up against veterans.

803
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,161
Fliers like von Richter.

804
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:26,903
Are you trying to say that,
that you think I won't get back tomorrow?

805
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:33,448
No, no. There's nothing so terribly difficult
about combat flying...

806
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:36,949
...except remember that Scotty
and those fellows have had experience.

807
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:38,609
They're old hands.

808
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:41,814
You can't afford to be too careless
or overconfident at first.

809
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:45,620
It's rather like a game at school. You gotta
be on your toes, watch everything.

810
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:47,922
Never forget anything you learn.

811
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:51,965
- You won't have any trouble.
- I'm glad to hear you say that.

812
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:53,601
It's true.

813
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:57,731
When you go out tomorrow,
you stick close to Scotty.

814
01:09:57,907 --> 01:10:00,671
Watch everything he does.
See the way he handles his ship.

815
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:04,677
- He is a fine flier, isn't he, Court?
- The best.

816
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:07,213
- Do you smoke?
- Yes, sir.

817
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:09,078
Oh, thanks, Court.

818
01:10:09,252 --> 01:10:12,619
You know, I liked your comparison
about this and a game at school.

819
01:10:12,788 --> 01:10:16,224
Did you? That's just about what it is.

820
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:22,053
Great, big, noisy, rather stupid game
that doesn't make any sense at all.

821
01:10:22,231 --> 01:10:24,791
None of us know
what it's all about or why.

822
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:26,958
Here we are,
going at it hammer and tongs.

823
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:30,628
I bet you those fellows there
feel exactly the same way about the enemy.

824
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:32,034
Possibly.

825
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:36,269
Then one day I suppose it'll all end
as suddenly as it began. We'll go home...

826
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:40,677
...till some other bunch of criminal idiots
sitting around a large table...

827
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:44,081
...shoves us into another war,
then we'll go at it again.

828
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:49,416
Do you remember my father? He used
to be a professor of biology at Queens.

829
01:10:49,592 --> 01:10:51,457
He always used to say:

830
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:56,064
"Man is a savage animal who, periodically,
to relieve his nervous tension...

831
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:57,927
...tries to destroy himself."

832
01:10:58,501 --> 01:11:00,992
That's just about what it is, Donnie.

833
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:02,736
I see.

834
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:07,174
- Good night, Donnie.
- Good night, Court.

835
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:08,674
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.

836
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,043
Oh, l...

837
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:16,609
I suppose it is just possible
that one might not get back.

838
01:11:16,786 --> 01:11:18,947
It has been known, hasn't it?

839
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:22,116
Well, in that case, I...

840
01:11:23,025 --> 01:11:25,289
Would you mind if I left this with you?

841
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:27,217
What is it?

842
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:30,388
Oh, it's something I got
on the crew last year.

843
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:33,592
It's silly, but, well,
it's rather important to me.

844
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:40,642
Good night.

845
01:12:03,132 --> 01:12:04,929
There's Mantez
and the 6th German army.

846
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,763
- Right under von Richter's patrol.
- Where's von Richter?

847
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:10,963
Gentlemen, Major Courtney.

848
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,165
Good morning.
I wanted to wish you good luck.

849
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:15,970
Sorry I didn't have any chance
to meet you last night.

850
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:18,340
- Best of luck. Same to you.
- Thank you.

851
01:12:18,514 --> 01:12:19,742
- And you.
- Thank you, sir.

852
01:12:19,915 --> 01:12:21,610
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

853
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:24,850
- Is Captain Scott down yet?
- On his way, excuse me.

854
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:26,716
Gentlemen, these are your planes:

855
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,481
Mr. Moorehead, Number 6.

856
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:31,889
- Mr. Rutherford, Number 5.
- They're game lads, aren't they?

857
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:33,891
- Young England.
- Yes.

858
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:35,860
This is Number 3, Number 4 on the end.

859
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,496
Hello, Court.

860
01:12:42,538 --> 01:12:44,836
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

861
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:50,879
Now, remember,
stick close and I'll get you through.

862
01:12:51,047 --> 01:12:54,380
Don't worry about me, Scott-o.
I'm fine, couldn't be better.

863
01:13:17,339 --> 01:13:19,534
- Switch off.
- Switch off.

864
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:21,869
- Contact.
- Contact.

865
01:13:22,445 --> 01:13:23,969
Switch off.

866
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:26,140
- Switch off.
- Contact.

867
01:13:26,315 --> 01:13:27,805
Contact.

868
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:17,614
Donnie!

869
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,086
Donnie!

870
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,537
- Two planes back.
- I know.

871
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:22,849
- Who?
- Scott-o, Billings.

872
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:32,791
You got what you wanted.

873
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,760
He's gone, just as I knew he would.

874
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:38,562
I watched him burning.

875
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,559
You killed him.

876
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:42,934
I didn't kill him.

877
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:45,266
You sent him up, you dirty butcher.

878
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:48,143
All right, gentlemen.

879
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:14,529
What a rotten war.

880
01:18:18,807 --> 01:18:21,275
Come on, Ronald, say good morning.
Say good morning.

881
01:18:21,443 --> 01:18:23,104
There you are, sir. There you are.

882
01:18:23,278 --> 01:18:26,076
Personality, that's what you said.
Personality.

883
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:27,909
- Hello, Brand.
- Hello, Phipps.

884
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,745
- You look like a new man.
- I never felt better in my life.

885
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:33,114
- Have you missed me?
- Well, yes, sir.

886
01:18:33,288 --> 01:18:35,017
Hello, sergeant.
How are the chickens?

887
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,953
- Top old eggs, sir.
- How's Courtney?

888
01:18:37,126 --> 01:18:40,562
- Oh, he's inside.
- Go on, driver. Hop on behind.

889
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:00,810
Hello, Brand.

890
01:19:00,983 --> 01:19:03,144
Hello, Courtney. How are you?

891
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:06,287
- You're looking fine.
- I couldn't feel better.

892
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:10,650
- Same old place, eh?
- Same old place.

893
01:19:10,826 --> 01:19:13,761
- Well, how are you, old boy?
- Wonderful.

894
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:16,829
What?

895
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:19,433
I was wondering
if you could stop playing with that.

896
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:21,296
Oh, I'm sorry. Nerves, I know.

897
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:26,564
I say, Courtney, do you remember
those Gyppie cork tips...

898
01:19:26,742 --> 01:19:30,542
...that you used to scream about?
I found a tin of them in the mess.

899
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:35,709
- You mean you brought these along for me?
- Yeah.

900
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:39,151
Well, thanks very much.

901
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:42,113
- Have a drink or something.
- Oh, thanks.

902
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:43,952
- Glass behind you.
- One for you?

903
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:46,686
- Yes, thanks.
- Hey, where's Scotty?

904
01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:48,523
I don't know.

905
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,392
How is he?

906
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:55,894
He's all right, I think.

907
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:03,202
Scotty and I haven't talked to each other
for about two weeks.

908
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:04,873
Oh, I'm sorry.

909
01:20:05,047 --> 01:20:08,505
Courtney, I hear headquarters
have been giving you a rotten time lately.

910
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:11,882
The old man says
you've been kicking up the very devil.

911
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:15,820
Is he? Well, you ought to know,
you're up there.

912
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:22,457
Come on, Brand, come on. What is it?

913
01:20:22,931 --> 01:20:25,263
Too important to telephone about.

914
01:20:46,855 --> 01:20:49,119
- That's insane. You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

915
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:52,283
The enemy are making their biggest push
the day after tomorrow.

916
01:20:52,494 --> 01:20:55,327
They've concentrated the munitions
at the Soulet railhead.

917
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:58,523
You destroy that railhead,
you'll stop their drives.

918
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,429
But, Brand, you're crazy.

919
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:03,036
Soulet is 60 kilometers
behind the enemy lines.

920
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:06,265
The German air force would be on our tails
before we were halfway.

921
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:08,602
- The flight couldn't make it.
- One plane could.

922
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:11,575
- What do you mean, one plane?
- One plane. One man. At dusk.

923
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:13,339
It's up to one man to go alone...

924
01:21:13,515 --> 01:21:16,450
...to take a chance at getting through
before they can stop him.

925
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:20,110
Do you think I could ask a man to do that?
He'd be dead before he started.

926
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:22,314
What can you do? You can't refuse.

927
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:26,826
No. I'll go myself.

928
01:21:26,995 --> 01:21:29,657
I'm afraid you can't do that.
I know exactly how you feel.

929
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:33,961
I had it myself for months.
Here at this desk, chained to it.

930
01:21:34,803 --> 01:21:38,534
You'll have to ask for a volunteer.
The instructions are all here.

931
01:21:40,809 --> 01:21:42,276
All right.

932
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:58,253
Attention, gentlemen.

933
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:03,063
Stay where you are, gentlemen.
I have a job for you.

934
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:05,028
This just came in from Wing, gentlemen:

935
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,363
"Enemy in the 22nd and 23rd sectors
plan major offensive...

936
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:10,869
...on the entire front
19th instant at ack-emma.

937
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,406
Munitions for the advance concentrated
in a dump at railhead at Soulet."

938
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:18,578
Our squadron's ordered to destroy it.

939
01:22:18,747 --> 01:22:21,272
Soulet's 60 kilometers
behind the German lines.

940
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,543
There's no chance for a flight
to get through.

941
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:28,952
But one man, flying low, hedgehopping,
might possibly succeed.

942
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:32,882
- Chances are 10-to-1 he won't come back.
- I'll go.

943
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:36,456
- I'd like a volunteer.
- I spoke first. Do I get that job?

944
01:22:36,632 --> 01:22:37,860
Is it mine?

945
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:41,235
Right.

946
01:22:41,603 --> 01:22:43,935
Here are your instructions.

947
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:47,637
You leave at dusk.
You've got about two hours.

948
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:49,676
Right.

949
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:53,537
Tell Sergeant Watkins
to get my plane ready.

950
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:08,887
- Get that out by the first post, Kirby.
- Yes, sir.

951
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:11,631
Here's this razor you like so much.
You take that.

952
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,062
- For me, sir?
- For you, sir.

953
01:23:13,235 --> 01:23:16,636
I couldn't, sir. You'll be wanting it
when you come back from the flight.

954
01:23:16,805 --> 01:23:19,000
Tomorrow morning, you'll be yelling,
"Kirby!

955
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:21,642
How'd you think I can shave
without me razor?"

956
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:25,041
No, Kirby. From now on,
I'm going to grow a long beard.

957
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,180
Take this.
Make you smell like a geranium.

958
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:29,249
Very good, sir, if you insist.

959
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:31,978
Shirts, socks.
Here, take the whole lot, Kirby.

960
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:34,213
- Come in.
- Oh, don't say that, sir.

961
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:47,659
I've been going over this and I've found
a route that'll give you a better chance.

962
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:50,361
Don't bother.
I don't want to hear anything from you.

963
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:53,667
I'm in command here
and you'll listen to what I have to say.

964
01:23:53,842 --> 01:23:56,675
I want that plane back, you understand?
We need them all.

965
01:23:57,112 --> 01:23:59,842
- I want you back.
- Back.

966
01:24:00,015 --> 01:24:01,778
Yes, back.

967
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:05,247
- Bring some chairs, Kirby.
- Yes, sir.

968
01:24:07,656 --> 01:24:10,591
Thank you. All right, that's all.

969
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,159
I've been in touch with Intelligence
and they've given me some...

970
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,696
- No, thank you.
- No?

971
01:24:17,866 --> 01:24:21,495
They've given me some rather interesting
information about this section here.

972
01:24:24,005 --> 01:24:27,133
It seems that for a quarter of a mile,
there's hardly anti-aircraft.

973
01:24:27,309 --> 01:24:29,368
That'd be a very good place to cross.

974
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:33,071
Go north then fly low
into the entrance of the Luonne valley.

975
01:24:33,248 --> 01:24:34,772
Fly low...

976
01:24:41,323 --> 01:24:42,881
Thanks.

977
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:50,192
I say you fly low
into the entrance of Luonne valley.

978
01:24:50,365 --> 01:24:52,890
As you know,
there's no activity there, either.

979
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:55,296
The hills will hide you
until you're through it.

980
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:58,462
And then you go north.
Hit the railway here.

981
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:02,202
Then east following the tracks
right into Soulet.

982
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:06,245
Around here, all the big ammunition
dumps. They're all grouped together.

983
01:25:06,414 --> 01:25:09,212
A hit anywhere in that vicinity
will set the whole thing off.

984
01:25:09,384 --> 01:25:11,375
The enemy high patrol
gets back at dusk...

985
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:13,919
...so you'll have to fly low
to avoid them.

986
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:18,024
Your only chance is to get there
before they spot you.

987
01:25:18,193 --> 01:25:19,888
That's amazing.

988
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:24,664
From that point on,
the place is alive with archies.

989
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,802
They'll phone ahead and you'll probably
run into some barrages...

990
01:25:28,603 --> 01:25:31,595
...but you'll just have to keep on going...

991
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:34,909
...and that's all.

992
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:39,643
Yes, that is undoubtedly all.

993
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:42,747
- I've a suggestion to make.
- What's that?

994
01:25:42,918 --> 01:25:46,183
You've got an hour and a half.
Why don't you lie down and have a sleep.

995
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:48,788
It'll do you good, freshen you up.
Get on your toes.

996
01:25:48,957 --> 01:25:50,584
No, I couldn't sleep.

997
01:25:50,759 --> 01:25:53,660
No? Well, how about one for the road?

998
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:56,696
No, I had two already.
This stuff works too quickly on me.

999
01:25:56,865 --> 01:26:00,232
- Oh, come on. One more won't hurt you.
- No, thank... Well...

1000
01:26:00,669 --> 01:26:02,398
To the job.

1001
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,068
I'll drink to that.

1002
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:08,232
- To the job.
- Right.

1003
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:16,142
- You're a funny bird.
- Really?

1004
01:26:16,318 --> 01:26:18,843
I found myself very amusing lately.

1005
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:25,255
You know, I've never seen one
of those big munition dumps hit the ceiling.

1006
01:26:25,427 --> 01:26:29,261
When it does, you'll probably hear it
back here. If you do, you can think of me.

1007
01:26:29,431 --> 01:26:32,366
Right. I'll think.

1008
01:26:32,968 --> 01:26:34,526
Court?

1009
01:26:36,972 --> 01:26:40,339
It's all the war, isn't it?
Donnie going and the old brass hats.

1010
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:42,374
- A Flight, B Flight.
- Orders.

1011
01:26:42,544 --> 01:26:44,808
Drinks, friends.

1012
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:48,347
I shouldn't go up there bad friends
with anybody, should I?

1013
01:26:48,516 --> 01:26:49,983
Be a good idea if you didn't.

1014
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:52,381
What I mean is especially with you.

1015
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:56,080
It has been a long time, hasn't it?
London, home, and all that.

1016
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:59,421
- We've had some fun, though, haven't we?
- Yes. Pretty good times.

1017
01:26:59,594 --> 01:27:02,188
I've missed you,
especially when I'd had a few beakers.

1018
01:27:02,364 --> 01:27:06,130
Nobody to take care of the corpse.
Good old Scotty blotto again, you know.

1019
01:27:06,301 --> 01:27:10,032
- You never did now when to stop anyway.
- Oh, it's no fun if you stop.

1020
01:27:10,205 --> 01:27:11,695
Cheers.

1021
01:27:14,576 --> 01:27:18,979
You ever forget that awful night at Carsnips
when I fell over with my head in the soup...

1022
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:21,047
...and you weren't there
to pick me out?

1023
01:27:21,216 --> 01:27:23,878
You should've seen her
when the soup arrived in her lap.

1024
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:28,216
Oh, she never had a lap. Ever see anything
quite so straight sitting down?

1025
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:31,655
- No. A lamp post.
- Optical Illusion.

1026
01:27:32,928 --> 01:27:36,329
There go me beads.
Oh, well, it's fun looking back, isn't it?

1027
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:38,693
You're an awful old fool, you know?

1028
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,458
How about that 40 winks?

1029
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:44,298
- Little froufrou. She hasn't altered much.
- No. Still the same.

1030
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,134
I shall now wake up with a nice,
fresh smile for Fritzie.

1031
01:27:47,309 --> 01:27:51,405
Good morning, Fritzie.
Here is your morning cup of tea:

1032
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,805
And your morning bun:

1033
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:05,920
- Court, I shouldn't be doing this.
- Oh, lie down. You've got lots of time.

1034
01:28:06,094 --> 01:28:09,962
- Well, you get me up. I rely on you.
- Leave it to me.

1035
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,866
- The C.o. Coming to see him off.
- Gun's are all right.

1036
01:28:23,044 --> 01:28:26,946
They'd better be. The rest of the plane too.
She's going on a real trip this time.

1037
01:28:27,115 --> 01:28:30,084
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, sergeant.

1038
01:28:33,254 --> 01:28:36,348
- Check the guns?
- Yes. They're all checked, sir.

1039
01:28:43,231 --> 01:28:46,860
- You're not flying, sir.
- Yes, I am, sergeant.

1040
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:53,799
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, sergeant.

1041
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:57,040
As a matter of fact,
thanks for everything.

1042
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:59,578
Give my love to the bees
and the chickens.

1043
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:04,513
- Switch off.
- Switch off.

1044
01:29:09,124 --> 01:29:11,684
- Contact.
- Contact.

1045
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,018
- <i>Have you got that?</i>
- Yes. Replacements tonight.

1046
01:37:28,189 --> 01:37:30,555
A Flight at dawn.
B Flight accompany bombers.

1047
01:37:30,725 --> 01:37:32,192
- You got that, Phipps?
- Yes, sir.

1048
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,793
And another thing...

1049
01:37:33,961 --> 01:37:37,488
...keep in touch with the observation posts
at Mainz for news of Courtney.

1050
01:37:37,665 --> 01:37:39,656
- <i>I think</i> we...
- You think? Well, don't think!

1051
01:37:39,834 --> 01:37:43,065
Tell them to keep their eyes open.
I think he's coming back.

1052
01:37:48,342 --> 01:37:50,139
- Just a little bit, sir...
- No, no.

1053
01:37:50,311 --> 01:37:52,472
I think you take a little, sir.

1054
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:56,081
We've got a petrol trench
down the side of the field.

1055
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,946
When we hear his motor,
we'll light it, of course.

1056
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:03,855
Yes? Any news.

1057
01:38:04,025 --> 01:38:05,754
- <i>Here's good news for you.</i>
- Good news?

1058
01:38:05,927 --> 01:38:09,727
<i>You have received special mention for</i>
<i>your part in stopping the enemy advance.</i>

1059
01:38:11,165 --> 01:38:12,427
What?

1060
01:38:13,067 --> 01:38:15,194
The 59th
has received special mention...

1061
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:17,564
...for their work in stopping
the enemy advance.

1062
01:38:17,738 --> 01:38:20,571
Why wasn't it me up there, Phipps?
I'm the one to be up there.

1063
01:38:20,741 --> 01:38:22,641
If only I'd known he was...

1064
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:33,687
He may come back.

1065
01:38:35,957 --> 01:38:37,686
Here he is!

1066
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:51,937
Enemy plane!

1067
01:39:25,273 --> 01:39:27,366
It's his helmet and goggles.

1068
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:39,019
It means a very gallant gentlemen
died this afternoon.

1069
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:41,281
And for what?

1070
01:39:41,455 --> 01:39:43,946
What we have all these deaths
accomplished?

1071
01:39:44,892 --> 01:39:47,053
So many fine chaps
who have died in this war...

1072
01:39:47,228 --> 01:39:50,061
...and are going to die in the future wars.

1073
01:39:51,966 --> 01:39:53,900
That's all, gentlemen.

1074
01:40:09,617 --> 01:40:11,346
Goodbye, Court.

1075
01:40:12,286 --> 01:40:13,947
Come along, sir.

1076
01:40:22,296 --> 01:40:25,595
Fall in, gentlemen.
Come along, lads. Line up, please.

1077
01:40:25,766 --> 01:40:27,233
Attention.

1078
01:40:27,568 --> 01:40:30,969
Orders for tomorrow morning.
Come along.

1079
01:40:33,607 --> 01:40:37,941
The 59th
has received special mention...

1080
01:40:38,879 --> 01:40:42,076
...for its part
in checking the enemy advance.

1081
01:40:43,217 --> 01:40:44,741
I know that...

1082
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:51,957
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Commanding officer's inside, sir.

1083
01:40:52,126 --> 01:40:54,151
Will you follow me, please?

1084
01:40:55,963 --> 01:40:57,863
Wait here, please, gentlemen.

1085
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:03,403
- Replacements, sir.
- Bring them in, Sergeant Watkins.

1086
01:41:03,571 --> 01:41:05,368
This way, please, gentlemen.

1087
01:41:08,676 --> 01:41:11,338
Lieutenant Carter,
reporting from the pool for duty, sir.

1088
01:41:11,512 --> 01:41:12,979
Very good, lads. Fall in.

1089
01:41:15,382 --> 01:41:19,079
Attention, commanding officer.
Stand easy.

1090
01:41:20,688 --> 01:41:24,681
Gentlemen, you will be glad to know...

1091
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:29,728
...that the 59th Squadron
has just received special mention...

1092
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:32,831
...for its part in checking
the enemy advance.

1093
01:41:34,201 --> 01:41:36,032
Orders for tomorrow:

1094
01:41:37,204 --> 01:41:40,401
A Flight,
ready to take off at dawn.

1095
01:41:40,574 --> 01:41:44,476
Patrol Marne Sector, 3500 meters.

1096
01:41:44,678 --> 01:41:50,947
B Flight, accompany bombers.
Mantez Wood Sector, 4000 meters.

1097
01:41:51,385 --> 01:41:55,287
You understand, gentlemen, that this sector
is a particularly dangerous one.

1098
01:41:55,456 --> 01:42:00,894
You new men, watch your flight leaders.
Act instantly on their signals.

1099
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:03,586
That will be your only chance
of coming through.

1100
01:42:05,332 --> 01:42:06,822
That's all.
