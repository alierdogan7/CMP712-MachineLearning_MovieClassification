Family history.

- (WALTER) Yes, Celia. Of course.

38

I just wondered...

39
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,595
What happened to her sister, Anne?

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,273
(WALTER) She was an actress.

41
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,396
She was indeed.
She made some films.

42
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,677
She played the best friend
or the school teacher.

43

That's her, up there.

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,354
Anne was the oldest.

45
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,351
She was adopted, of course.

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,353
As frequently happens,
they were desperate for children.

47
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,590
But they didn't think
they could have any,

48
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,035
and so they adopted one.

49
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,192
And then, lo and behold,
along came the babies anyway.

50
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,148
They were all very close.

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,834
You didn't think it would work.

Let's see if we can find
something more appropriate.

Precisely in what way
are we doing that?

and Austria.

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,117
- One has to have the means.
- We've got the bloody means!

173
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,111
Even if we have let Germany re-arm,

174
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,396
we mustn't exaggerate
how strong she is!

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,518
Under this current government of
Mr Chamberlain, my own leader,

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,035
we are behaving as if
we have to avoid war

177
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,599
at absolutely all costs.

178
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,877
So every day we do something
that makes the situation worse.

179
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,792
Do you really think that is true?

180
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,712
What did you have in mind?

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,838
To give you one example,
I've heard rumours.

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,355
I've heard the most
extraordinary rumours

183
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,670
that we are trying
to interest the Nazis

184
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,991
in accepting a gigantic secret loan,

185
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,391
which we will negotiate for them
on the international markets,

186
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,757
so they might turn their armament
industry back to peaceful means.

187
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,354
We are actually planning
to give them money!

188
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,670
That does sound truly bizarre,
Hector.

189
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,593
Alexander fought in the war,
got wounded,

190
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,432
so I don't criticise him,

191
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,830
but not enough other people
are speaking out.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,117
It's up to young MPs like me
to get rid of our present leadership,

193
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,157
which is leading us
towards our doom.

194
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,880
That is... quite a claim, Mr Haldane.

195
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,918
Yes, and I'm aware
it isn't a popular thing to say

196
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,152
the present leadership will stand
no opposition or criticism.

197
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,959
The present leadership
view Mr Churchill as dangerous

198
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,838
because he would stand up to Hitler.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,356
He doesn't care
about giving offence to the Nazis.

200
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,637
So I feel I have to do
everything in my power

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,315
to make sure Mr Churchill
is not ignored.

202
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,914
Come on Thursday.

203
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,679

in the afternoon.

204
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,071
- Can you come? (LAUGHS)
- Yes.

205
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,354
I'll still be at Cranmore, I can come.

206
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,479
(BALCOMBE) Excuse me.

207
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,632

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,791

he could be right.

I love it when you read to me.

- I found Sonia.
- That's splendid.

- You didn't see anyone pass by here?
- No, dear.

one of the servants.

She didn't realise
it was forbidden territory.

apparently.

263

The government needs
to store things here?

It seemed a harmless thing to do.

265
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,832
The reason he gave is interesting,
and quite funny, and rather rude.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,194
He said there were so few places

267
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,316
where one can trust
the servants won't go any more,

268
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,710
but knowing our servants,
that wasn't a worry here.

269
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,711
He said that?

270
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,555
They hardly manage to clean the
house, let alone the outbuildings!

Sonia and Anne.

Why are they storing records
that are labelled as foxtrots?

273
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,389
Which clearly are not.

274
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,075

of maximum security.

Since Munich they've been recording
many government calls

278

has been so inadequate.

an extraordinarily busy fortnight.

which I must admit was spectacular!

it put Versailles to shame.

Then there was the one
at Holland House,

Oh, yes. Hector Haldane.

347
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,679
Always thought
he had a marvellous name.

348
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,308
He was one of the young
Members of Parliament

349
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,994
speaking out against
appeasing Herr Hitler.

350
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,914
I read one of his speeches once.
Passionate stuff.

351
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,069
He's been calling for a change
at the top for a new prime minister.

Lawrence didn't tell me very much.

370

He said he thought Hector
had killed himself.

371
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,311
It's possible. He was excitable.

372
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,753
But there was something
very touching about him.

373

I hope you approve. I'm conducting
the choir myself tonight.

It's an anthem that reaches back
almost as far as your family!

he is an improvement on the last one.

Yes.

I was just thinking about
Mr Balcombe. What does he do, Papa?

386
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,360
He works at the Home Office
doing various things.

387
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,556
He's in the secret service.
It's obvious.

388
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,438
Is he?

389
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,670
Would he have taken
an interest in Hector?

390
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,196
Very possibly, but I don't think
he can have bumped him off.

391
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,432
Bumped him off?
Oh, Anne, your love of the dramatic!

392
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,636
No, I didn't mean that, of course.

393
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,916
Mind you, he is rather spooky.

394
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,278
He seems a little odd, I admit,
but he shares my love of fishing.

395
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,079
It's just... Hector seemed
worried about him.

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,593
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe it WAS the boy. Who knows?

511
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,035
Perhaps he'd had wine
when we weren't looking.

512
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,872
Or somebody
asked him to move him.

513
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,235
Why would they do that, darling?

514
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,073
To make me seem unreliable,
a bit dotty.

515
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,550
He knows I'm friends
with Lawrence and with Hector.

516
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,713
I think we should let Mr Balcombe
disappear with all his boxes

517
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,075
and just not invite him again - ever.

518
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,595
We want to be sure we get rid of him,

519
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,432
which I'm sure we can do.

520
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,160
We've lost a terrific chance
to do a lot of snooping.

521
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,070
- So, I think that is everything.
- Including all the foxtrots?

522
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,359
I believe so, yes.

523
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,392
And there's nothing left behind
in here, is there?

524
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,516
- In the house?
- I don't think so, Joseph.

525
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,113
No.

526
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,998
No. I don't know of anything.

527
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,672
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in.

528
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,519
I just wanted to see how you are.

529
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,638
I'm absolutely fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

530
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,711
Of course not.

531
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,189
Anyway, the spooky man
has gone at last.

532
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,113
Papa says we're returning
to London in the morning.

533
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,599
- Really?
- Yes.

534
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,955
Because Parliament
may be about to be recalled.

535
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,712
It's a bit of a crisis, apparently.

536
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,678
But I think it's terrific we're going.

537
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,991
Nowadays I can't stand it
down here after a couple of weeks.

538
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,513
No disrespect to Sonia.

539
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,635
You'll forgive me, won't you?

540
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,631

I wasn't expecting you!

543
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,431
The house is not aired!

544
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,319
We had no idea you were
coming back to London today.

545
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,278
And Mrs Hardiman is not back
till the end of the week.

546
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,749
(ALEXANDER) No need
to alarm yourself, Betty.

547
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,433
We live in unpredictable times.

548
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,397
We can manage without Mrs Hardiman.

549
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,949
And there is this awful racket
from next door, sir.

550
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,758
They're getting ready for a party.

551
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,992
- There's been banging all day long.
- I'm sure it will all be fine.

552
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,674
As long as they don't
throw anything into our garden.

553
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,114
And remember to invite us.

Glorious... I know
it's a very sensitive subject,

560
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,557
but with my new job,
I have access to all sorts of things,

561
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,793
and I know who to ask
to find out even more.

562
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,076
So... only if you wish it, of course,

563
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,630
but I could find out
who your real parents were.

564
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,949
- You could?
- So what do you think?

565
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,597
I don't know if I want to know.

566
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,870
For some reason,
it's never really worried me

who my real parents are.

- Yes.

So, what's the tune
you want to play me?

It's not a tune, it's a conversation.

651
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,598
It's a recording of a meeting.

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,435
I found it among things Mr Balcombe
was storing with us in Norfolk.

653

There was another record as well,
of Hector screaming, really upset.

you don't trust what I say.

When did I say that?

658
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,356
I know it's my fault I haven't read
more about the political situation,

659
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,999
being too bound up with my work.

660
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,755
It's conceivable the secret service
are listening in and recording

661
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,071
the conversations
of those opposed to the government.

662
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,993
- That is possible?
- Extremely possible.

663
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,754
Yes, and that spying
and these recordings

664
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,718
could be used to put pressure
on people, couldn't they?

665
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,235
To blackmail them into silence,
if necessary.

666
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,789
- That too is possible, if risky.
- Yes,

667
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,349
because they wouldn't wish that
to become public.

668
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,080
No! lmagine what the supporters
of Winston Churchill

669
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,071
would do with information like that.

670
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,356
It would bring down
the present leadership,

671
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,476
Churchill would become Prime Minister,

672
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,518
that would lead to a bolder approach
to Germany!

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,910

that elements in the secret service

00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,556
are taking things further
than the Prime Minister intended.

676
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,278
Is that what's on that recording?

677
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,910
Oh, no, no.
It's merely a boring meeting.

678
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,152
But I thought perhaps you would know
who the people were.

679
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,515
Why would they record a boring meeting?

680
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,875
Perhaps because somebody
couldn't be there

681
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,758
and they didn't want notes taken?

682
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,150
That's just
a slightly drunken actor's guess.

683
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,357
But now, if war comes,
none of this matters.

684
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,592
On the contrary, my dear,
it will matter all the more.

685
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,000
Some of these people don't want a war.

686
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,879
They don't want Winston Churchill
as Prime Minister.

687
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,190
They want this country to be left alone.

688
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,749
They don't care
what's happening in Europe

689
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,309
as long as this lovely place
is not disturbed.

690
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,994
They'll want to make peace
as soon as they can,

691
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,116
maybe at any price,

692
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,999
and give Hitler
all sorts of things in return.

693
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,433
But we shouldn't worry.

694
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,319
We will be looking down at everybody
from a cinema screen

695
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,358
dressed in ludicrous Victorian dress.

696
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,153
That is, if we ever get our call.

697
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,389
(RALPH) Hello! Hello, down there!

698
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,635
There you are!

699
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,918
You're so early. You're much too early.

700
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,640
It is nearly 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, Celia.

701
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,189
You missed something gorgeous.

702
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,318
There were exotic birds
and fountains of gold water.

703
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,152
And Aunt Elizabeth is still here.

704
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,834
Like me, she hasn't slept all night.

705
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,954
So you've been up all night,
Aunt Elizabeth?

706
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,669
Yes. Still to go to bed!

707
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,478
I stayed up with the young people.

708
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,279
Haven't done that for years.
What amazing times we live in!

709
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,431
I was meant to go hours ago,
but I never did.

710
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,636
- (CHUCKLES)
- Oh, Mr Williams!

711
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,631
Just the person I want to see.

712
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,712
- I am?
- You must come over here, come on,

713
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,440
and hear what I've got to tell you.

714
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,993
I've been tidying up my house,
or rather the servants have,

715
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,673
in case we have to run like mice,

716
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,308
and you'll never guess
what they have unearthed.

717
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,596
My whole collection
of theatre programmes,

718
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,069
- many of them featuring you.
- (CHUCKLING) No!

719
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,951
Mm. You in <i>Richard II</i>
and in <i>The Last Days of Pompeii...</i>

720
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,951
Marvellous! I'd love to see them.

721
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,473
(WHISPERS)

722
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,551
You'll have to come with me now,

723
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,029
because if this irritating war
breaks out,

724
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,872
the whole thing will get scattered.

725
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,032
You don't mind coming to my little
house by St Paul's after tea?

726
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,350
- Not at all. That'd be thrilling.
- Gilbert.

727
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,115
My career in theatre programmes.
I never kept anything.

728
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,998
- I was superstitious.
- Gilbert.

729
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,798
- Milk?
- Thank you. Hmm?

730
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,188
We had an appointment.

731
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,039
Yes... Give me what you want me
to listen to, dear,

732
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,715
the record, and I'll listen to it
when I get home, I promise.

733
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,474
(RALPH) I'd love to have seen
<i>The Last Days of Pompeii.</i>

734

(RALPH LAUGHS)

735
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,119
What? I didn't say anything.

736

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

737
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,959
(DIRECTOR) Where is he?

738
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,469
Where the hell is Mr Williams?

739
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,558
I'm late.

740
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,153
I'm late.

741
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,595
Well, come on! Come on, Gilbert!

742
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,196
- Where've you been?
- Anne...

743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,993
(DIRECTOR) We have to go
straightaway. No rehearsal.

744
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,357
It's clouding over, we're losing
the light. We need to film now.

745
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,799
Mark it, please <i>House of Cheyney,</i>
scene 105, take 1.

746
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,749
(DIRECTOR) Action!

747
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,994
Uncle, I know you said not to take
the job at the big house.

748
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,676
But the master has been so kind
to me, and it is a fine opportunity.

749
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,469
(GILBERT) There will be
other opportunities.

750
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,517
I know you have your eye on him.

751
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,797
But he is engaged to another

752
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,432
and, however much you hope,
that situation will not change.

753
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,273
You should listen to me, Jenny.

754
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,194
(DIRECTOR) Cut! Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

755
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,592
Apparently...

756
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,034
I'm not quite sure how to put it.

757
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,236
- We're now at war.
- (MURMURING)

758
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,630
We're at war with Germany.

759
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,392
So it's happened.

760
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,757
This news is very shocking,
but we still have a job to do.

761
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,150
I've asked for a wireless to be sent up,

762
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,595
and when it arrives,
we can gather round it,

763
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,988
take an early tea break.

764
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,152
But for now, we'll pick up
from where we were.

765
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,515
Roll up. Action!

766
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,672
- Do you understand, Anne?
- Yes, I think so.

767
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,956
Which bit do you think
I don't understand?

768
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,236
That we're at war,
or what "action" means?

769
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,755
Come on, for God's sake! Action!

770
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,753
- (ANNE) Thank you.

You're not waiting for me,
are you?

772
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,597
I'm sorry. It was a very long day.

773
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,672
- We've been watching the door.
- Mama's gone to bed early.

774
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,229
But we thought
we should all be together.

775
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,472
We thought today of all days
you might read to us.

(OFFICER) Sorry, miss,
this is no place for you.

Come along.

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,156
- (GASPS)
- You step outside.

787
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,190
I was just taking him his tea.

788
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,794
I was only a couple of minutes late.

789
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,397
He wasn't in his dressing room.
That's when I found him.

790
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,630
They say it looks like he shot himself...

791
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,473
They said I shouldn't ask but...
that's how it looks.

792
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,915
- Did you see a note?
- I didn't see much.

793
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,550
- So you didn't see a note?
- I couldn't really look at anything.

794
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,156
I was only a tiny bit late
and... there he was.

795
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,114
And I can't get through
to them on location.

796
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,794
I've called and called.
His scene is very soon.

797
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,758
It would be terrible
if they were expecting him.

<i>I'm... sorry, I made a mistake.</i>
<i>I was misinformed.</i>

801
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,474
<i>Mr Newbolt is not here.</i>
<i>He's gone to Paris.</i>

802
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,349
To Paris?
But he was in Scotland.

<i>He WAS in Scotland, and now</i>
<i>he's in Paris. He went this morning.</i>

- You must be so upset.
- Yes.

It was horrible.
I really was very fond of him.

812
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,512
Does anybody know what happened?

813
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,468
They say he shot himself.
That's what it looks like.

But there wasn't a note.

815
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,714
I waited for hours to see

816
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,075
if they would find a note from him,
a message.

00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,515
- And they didn't.
- He may not have written one.

emotional time right now,

there myself, darling,

I can tell you
I dream about it nearly every night.

I know a lot of people are very confused.

825
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,471
And I don't want to seem
hysterical or overdramatic...

You're an actress.
Some of that is required.

00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,191
- (CHUCKLES) Yes, that's true.
- You're so bright and original,

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,636
Yes, and so I don't want it to seem
as though I'm imagining things.

00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,199
I understand.

And Gilbert may have killed himself.
But what if he didn't?

What if something else is going on?
I mean, first Hector and then him.

Why would they
concern themselves with Gilbert?

and that's very disconcerting.

00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,231
It applies to me as well.

I'm still good at, darling.

845
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,634

It is amazing how much
has changed in a day.

847
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,760
It's incredible,
coming through the park just now

848
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,708
I thought I saw
this huge silver beast.

849
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,108
A silver beast?

850
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,748
It was, in fact, a barrage balloon
being inflated,

851
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,639
but it was moving by itself
along the ground.

852
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,715
And they say two million people
are being evacuated today.

853
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,997
And lots and lots of people
are having their pets put down.

854

- Their pets?
- Mm.

855
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,760
Really? How awful!

856
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,673
Because they're leaving and
there's nobody to look after them,

857
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,796
or because they feel
it's being responsible.

858
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,669
- I may be going to America.
- To America?

859
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,752
- When are you going?
- Maybe very soon.

860
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,670
Things keeps changing, but at the
moment the government suggests

861
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,957
I should go there and try
and raise funds for the war effort.

862
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,953
Don't worry.
Remember what I said.

863
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,909
So can you go down to Norfolk
to look after Aunt Elizabeth?

864
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,834
She's staying down there.
You know she hates to be alone.

865
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,037
Your mother will join you
when she can. Won't you, darling?

866
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,998
I just need to leave this garden
in the best state I can.

867
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,072
It would be good if you could
go to Norfolk, darling.

868
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,119
Yes. They just want me at the studio
for one more day, to do some sound.

870

I don't know if you meant
to leave them behind.

873

but I didn't know who else to give it to.

874
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,910
I didn't see this
in my dressing room.

875
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,991
It was in a cupboard right at the back.

876
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,116
It will be a shock seeing him again, Anne.

877

You'll find it distressing

seeing Mr Williams
springing back to life, so to speak.

879
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,032
Yes, of course it's strange...
so soon after.

880
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,919
Yes, that's why I thought
we'd get it out of the way,

881
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,595

- Hello, darling.

1170
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,233
Oh, I didn't know
whether I'd ever see you again.

1171
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,630
I didn't know
whether you'd really be here.

1172
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,109
Yes, they suddenly
sent me to France. Don't cry.

1173
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,475
I am not cry... I'm not crying.

1174
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,474
It's just, for a moment,
everything seemed all right,

1175
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,993
and I know it isn't.

1176
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,594
Now then, when we've got
all our flags pinned up,

1177
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,955
I think we should have
a bit of a sing-song.

1178
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,429
What about a song
from each of your countries?

1179
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,034
- Everybody like the sound of that?
- (ALL) Yes!

1180
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,193
- Something terrible is going on.
- I know.

1181
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,396
- Ralph is involved.
- I know that too.

1182
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,549
You know?

1183
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,757
Do you think he realises the
full extent of what they're doing?

1184
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,150
- Maybe he doesn't.
- I don't know the answer.

1185
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,676
He's my brother.
I can't believe he would...

1186
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,032
I want to believe he couldn't.

1187
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,431
What I've found out is that there's
a group of them in the secret service

1188
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,194
and a motley collection of other people,

1189
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,669
including some
very determined aristocrats

1190
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,150
who are trying to bring this war
to an end before it's even started.

1191
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,278
They think we have no chance.
They want to do a deal with Hitler.

1192
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,396
I think they killed my friend Gilbert.

1193
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,597
- And they blackmailed Hector...
- They are very dangerous.

1194
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,437
# Be there at our waking,
your faith there, we pray

1195

# Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,
at the break of the day #

1196
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,713
They drove Hector to kill himself,

1197
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,475
- I've got a recording of a meeting.
- Can you give it to me?

1198
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,835
I don't have it here.

1199
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,390
I really have to have it.
Proof is invaluable.

1200
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,879
I must get it tomorrow.

1201
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,838
We'll meet in the morning,
Somewhere I won't be followed.

1202

(SINGS SONG IN FRENCH)

1203
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,393

1204

(SCOFFS) The vet?

1205
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,152
I have to take a cat to be put down.
We could meet there.

1206
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,517
- Yes, that sounds rather perfect.

1207
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,434
- It's all right. We are in love.
- Are we?

1208
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,194
That's what I told him, and
that's what he's going to see.

1209
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,912
Not in front of the children,
Glorious! Come along.

1210
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,117
If we're to use your idea,
I'd better get the address of a vet.

1211
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,236
We can't use one that's near the house.

1212
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,676
It has to be out of the way,
in the suburbs. You understand?

1213
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,957
I'll do that now, use
the great resources of the building.

1214
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,236
- No, don't go.
- I won't be a moment.

# And he won the heart of a lady #

1217
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,036
Now we've started the singing,

1218

1219
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,273
Not my most brilliant idea.

Come with me, Glorious.

1221
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,994
- I've got something to show you.
- Come with you where?

1222
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,311
Follow me. It's important.
I think you should come as well.

1223
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,713
It's such a big basement.
Where are we going?

1224
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,677
You've only seen a corner of it.

(SOUND OF TYPING)

1226
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,711
Right. Come on in. This is Miss Semel.

1227
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,316
- She's working late.
- She is.

1228
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,632
Now, we have two things
for you, Anne.

1229
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,870
- Your identity card...
- That was quick.

1230
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,918
Splendid. I asked Ralph
to arrange it, and that is quick.

1231
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,436
Rather a long walk to get to it, though.

1232
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,036
That's perfect. You have your card.
You're officially you.

1233
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,754
I'd better get back to
the ambassadors, darling.

1234
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,195
I've spent too much time
with the children.

1235
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,590
They're so much more interesting (!)

1236
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,752
- I'll come with you.
- Just a moment.

1237
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,070
- What is it?
- Why are you running away?

1238
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,755
I'm not running away.
Why would I do that?

1239
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,274
I don't know.

1240
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:43,952
I found out the other thing,
the one we talked about.

1241
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,556
It seems a rather appropriate moment
to do it, to go with the card.

1242
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,392
If you want.

1243
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,118
You mean about my parents?

1244
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,469
Do you want to hear,
or do you want to run off?

1245
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,240
All right. Why not?

1246
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,590
- Good night, Miss Semel.
- Good night.

1247
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,990
I think you'll be pleased.

1248
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,798
It explains your theatrical bent -
well, I think it does.

1249
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,834
They were a Romany family.

1250
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,070
Your parents were gypsies.

1251
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,596
There are no pictures, sadly.

1252
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,832
One of them
must've been blonde, mustn't they?

1253
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,197
Maybe they had Russian blood.

1254
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,433
Thank you.
You're right. I do like the idea.

1255
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,955
I see nothing wrong
in coming from gypsies.

1256
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,277
I think I'll go back to the party now.

1257
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,632
Hello?

1259
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,715
How are you here?
You were in church this morning!

1260
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,791
YOU'RE here,
and YOU were in the church.

1261
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,109
Why are you here?

1262
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,874
I didn't realise you were
the son of an ambassador.

1263
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,600
They thought I might be able
to contribute to the party.

1264

I'm sure you will be. Excuse me.

1270
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,154
- Here, have some more.
- Oh, thank you.

1271
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,797
I have an address for you.

1272
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,191
- You can find out anything here.
- I've just discovered that.

1273
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,955
We'll meet there. Put the evidence
you have into an envelope,

1274
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,680
and address it
to someone other than me.

- Doesn't matter. Winston Churchill.

1277
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,035
- Will they follow me there?
- No.

Keep an eye out, but I don't think so.

1279
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,030
They won't follow you into the vet.
They're far too squeamish.

1280
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,474
There you are, darling.

1281
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,870
I'm off to take Bombardier
to the vet for...

1282
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,589
- Well, you know what for.
- Yes. What things have come to.

1283
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,274
There may be lot of people there,
so I could be a while.

1284
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,716
Anne, if it's not too much to ask,

1285
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,429
I think you should take Horatio too.
He needs to be done as well.

1286
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,828

1287

we'll be shutting up the house.

1288

I'll take Bombardier
because Aunt Elizabeth

1289
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,073
has asked for that to happen.

1290
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,117
I'll find another home for Horatio.

1291
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,874
- I'm sure I can.
- No, darling, we can't do that.

1292
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,600

are having to do this.

it's not necessary yet.

No, I'm the only one who's not
doing anything at the moment,

1298
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,514
so I should do it,
if that's what's required.

1299
