00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:52,683
It's always an adjustment, sir.

351
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:58,356
I always say, coming home is a
lot harder than going to war.

352
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,157
So many damn expectations.

353
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,727
Yes, sir.

354
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,297
So, what's the deal?
You married, you got kids?

355
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,399
I have a son, he's 5. 

356
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:15,907
Oh, man, that's a great age.
I have a couple of little
ones myself.

357
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,842
How old are they, sir?

358
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:22,013
Oh, the photos
are a little out of date.

359
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,215
It's amazing how fast
they grow, huh?

360
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:25,816
It is.

361
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:28,986
So, I take it you know why
you've been assigned here.

362
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:33,658
Yes, sir. I'm sorry about
Sergeant Stevens, I heard
about the accident.

363
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:38,696
Man survives Anbar to kiss
a guard rail on his way
to the Wal-Mart.

364

to ship out in nine months...

a chicken without a head.

368

until I find a suitable
replacement. You up for it?

369
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,586

cut out for you.

372

for a permanent fill, but until
then, you are in charge.

373
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:16,500
Best guess, you'll be here
three months, maybe six.

374

to deploy anytime soon?

375

of these kids don't have a clue.

to combat is Kill Zone 2.

382

you're here to stay.

I got my camelback, Sarn't.

390
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:02,646
You got a heat casualty
with a core temp of 112...

391

with your canteen?

work out for you?

to grab the water jugs on it?

care how Alma makes it.

00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:22,125
What?

704
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:22,125
Get out.

705
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,746
Look, I don't know what just
happened back there, but--

706
00:54:43,779 --> 00:54:45,081
It's not your fault.

707
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:47,450
I'm sorry if I did
something that--

708
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:51,121
No, I'm-- I'm sorry.

709
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,965
I should probably go.

710
00:55:02,998 --> 00:55:05,201
You can stay if you want.

711
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:11,007
Stay.

712
00:55:31,727 --> 00:55:33,363
What does that say?

713
00:55:36,565 --> 00:55:39,936
El Porvenir.

714
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:43,473
It's the name of my hometown.

715
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,975
It means the future.

716
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,446
That's nice.

717
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,884
It's not, believe me.

718
00:55:58,053 --> 00:56:00,190
It's a good thing you left,
then.

719
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:07,797
I still got my father and my
little brother back home.

720
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:13,169
I'm just starting to bring
them over here, you know?

721
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:21,978
Until then, it's like my
heart is in two places.

722
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:26,749
What about you?

723
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:28,985
What were you doing
in Afghanistan?

724
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,187
I was a medic.

725
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,488
Like a doctor or something?

726
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:33,856
More like an EMT.

727
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:38,328
I rode around in convoys and
assisted them when they got hit.

728
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,498
Sounds hard.

729
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,080

730
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:04,687
I don't know too many
Mexicans with blue eyes.

731

I don't know too many
girls in the Army.

732
00:58:13,222 --> 00:58:15,024
Come on in.

733
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:18,895
Hi, I was on my way out, sir.

734
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,263
You wanted to see me?

735
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:24,167
Have a seat, Sergeant,
close the door, please.

736
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:39,649
I just got word from battalion.
They moved up deployment.

737
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,351
We ship out in 60 days.

738
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,655
Sir?

739
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:51,027
I need you to keep a lid on it
till COB tomorrow when we make
the formal announcement.

740
00:58:55,497 --> 00:58:58,701
This was supposed to be
a temporary assignment.

741
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:05,708
I have a son,
and you assured me--

742
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:08,010
I'm sympathetic
to your situation.

743
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:11,281
But orders are orders.
There's nothing I can do.

744
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:16,185
What about my replacement?

745
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:19,221
Last I heard they were trying
to pull someone from distro...

746
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:22,792
but they're running on empty
same as everyone else.

747
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:31,267
If you don't mind my asking,
sir, how old are those photos?

748
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,371
A couple of years, why?

749
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:40,510
Do you ever worry you won't
be able to catch up anymore?

750
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:47,750
I know what I am...
and I know what I'm good at.

I've come to peace with that.

752

01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:02,332

guarentee the repair cost...

755
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:15,111

756
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,179

And now you're telling me
it'll cost 500 bucks?

757
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:18,748
You guys are all the same,
aren't you?

758
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,350
Why don't you take your
business somewhere else?

759
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:23,519
Yeah, why don't you go back to
your own country, huh? How do
you feel about that?

760
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:25,321
You want to see my
green card, pendeho?

You want to see
my green card, asshole?

01:00:28,023 --> 01:00:29,859
Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!

764
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,694
I'm gonna report your ass
to the Better Business Bureau.

765
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:35,798
Yeah, fuck you, coolero!
I don't give a fuck what you do!

766
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,874
I'm sorry you had to see that.

01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:56,219
Terrell was picking you up?

768
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:12,602
You sure?

769
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,576
Okay.

to say, buddy.

Ah, no sugar. I'll take it.

Really? Shit.

It's been a long time since
we've been at a playground
together, huh?

What are you talking about?

788
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,287
My unit was in the pipeline
for deployment later this year
and they moved it up.

get us health insurance?

Could be 15 months.

the fuck you're talking about.

goddamn resemblance.

Huh? Well, why don't you
give me something then, huh?

taste of how you feel coming
back after 15 months...

You don't know what it's like.

Somebody rings a doorbell,
and I think, hm...

I wonder
if it's dress uniforms.

country, but you won't fight
for your son, will you?

I don't have a choice.

and you made it.

he's gonna stay with us.

Well, you made your choice,
so I'll make mine.

Are you trying to make me cry?

872
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,238
No.

873
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,238
It won't work.

874
01:07:56,271 --> 01:08:02,845
Can't deal with tears.
You can talk to me, though.

875
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,314
You know that, right?

876
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,314
Yeah, I know that.

877
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,483
Because we're all
we got out here.

878

That's right.

879

You make me feel good, Maggie.

880
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,694
You always have.

881
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:24,233
The truth is... you excite me.

882
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:31,874
Relax. Nobody's coming in.

You're married.

884

and you know it.

other side, it's not--

I will fucking shoot you.

Come on, Swann, we were just
messing around, right?

904

No, not me.

905
01:10:06,234 --> 01:10:11,873
All right, I fucked up, okay?
I lost my head for a second.

906

Yeah, I'm okay.

A lot of things happened.

your guard down for a second?
Why? You think--

you trying, but do me a favor.

to celebrate my promotion,
care to join us?

some load planning to do.

925

To tell you the truth,
I wish we could just fast
forward the next four weeks.

waiting for Christmas.

tour to Korea. Super kush.

with the CO?

my kid for two years.

pissed.

part of me actually...

It's really fucked up.

All I know is you're
one hell of a medic.

944
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:34,543
Now the trick is to get it right
in the vein, just like that...

945
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:39,581
because that's where the
medicine needs to go.

946
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:44,119
and then we put a piece of tape
over it, so it doesn't move.

947

Nice and easy,
hold on... okay.

Good job. Okay?

949
01:13:57,298 --> 01:14:02,237
Now we're gonna let the patient
rest, because we're gonna talk
about something.

950
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,473
Does that mean no bedtime story?

951
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:08,977
No, no, we can have a bedtime
story, but just pop up here
for a sec, okay? Come on.

Okay.

For a while because of work?

Why?

958
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:38,273
Because I have a very important
job and those people
depend on me.

a little bit shorter.

is that I love you a ton.

 What is it, Swann?

1217
01:36:23,577 --> 01:36:27,782
It's about Sergeant Butcher,
sir.

1218
01:36:32,986 --> 01:36:36,357
Okay, good. Good.

1219
01:36:43,096 --> 01:36:44,064
All right, here we go.

1220

I guess this is it, right?

1221
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:16,430
Right here, right now.

1222
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:22,269
If you're looking for tears and
a bed of roses, you better go
looking for another gal.

1223
01:37:22,302 --> 01:37:24,872
Maybe I will.

1224
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:26,707
I bet.

like this.

Just so you know,
I plan on coming back.

1229

I plan to stay here.

No promises.

Okay, pick any two.

1234
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:43,016
Mm-hm.

1235
01:38:43,049 --> 01:38:44,985
This one and this one.

1236
01:38:45,018 --> 01:38:51,325
Good choice. Okay, so we're
gonna set one to Texas time.

1237
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:52,626
How do you set them?

1238
01:38:52,659 --> 01:38:54,728
You gotta pull it out.

1239
01:38:54,761 --> 01:39:00,334
And then this one, we're gonna
set to what time it is in
Afghanistan, okay?

1240
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:04,304
And that way, we know what time
it is where the other one is.

1241
01:39:04,337 --> 01:39:05,405
Hm.

1242
01:39:05,438 --> 01:39:07,508
Sound good?

1243
01:39:08,608 --> 01:39:10,344
Now, would you like one
on each wrist?

1244
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:13,380
Next to each other.

1245
01:39:13,413 --> 01:39:16,817

to go over the custody papers.

There's nothing to sign.
I didn't bring them.

1251
01:40:16,976 --> 01:40:18,945
I just want
what's best for Paul...

1252
01:40:18,978 --> 01:40:23,950
and I don't think that right now
is a good time to be getting
into all of this...

1253
01:40:23,983 --> 01:40:29,823
so, just go, and we will talk
about it when you get back.

1254
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:34,261
Thank you.

1255
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:40,700
Okay, where is he?

1256
01:40:40,733 --> 01:40:42,202
I'll get him.

1257
01:40:50,276 --> 01:40:52,579
Can I do that?

1258
01:41:07,727 --> 01:41:11,065
Promise you won't die.

Are you gonna hit a lot
of home runs while I'm gone?

1263

Are you excited
about your new bedtime?

of 8:30, are you cool with that?
