This england is very strange place.
everybody knows english here..

129
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,290
as same in india..

130
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,250
hey teacher

131
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,362
just hold it

132
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,669
lf our country is so dirty,
where dust,mock,

133
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,203
so you,
since 140 years..

134
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,249
what are you doing in our country

135
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:33,749
cleaning

136
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,311
l tell you

137
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,285
our country is a golder bird

138
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,725
to whom you people want to sale it

139
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,825
your stomach will be bust
but bird wont come in your mouth

140
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,232
because that bird became a hawk

141
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,273
which will eat you..

142
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,313
our dadda has sent us here
to learn..

143
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:05,840
only for leaning

144
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,616
otherwise l'd have teach you today

145
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,359
The pees on the pot which
by the drinks water

146
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,573
bravo, gajendar singh..

147
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,935
Even you dont play bad..

148
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,636
so what was she saying

149
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,776
We came to know that boy
had no mistake

150
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:22,819
management misbehaved

151
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,876
we should talk

152
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:28,723
why you are like that

153
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:35,391
some wild gave you your thing back
so you think wild are good?

154
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:38,960
you're right.

155
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,226
lts the favour of that anglos..

156
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,940
that they got public training
and leaved.

157
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,209
if it'd be ratangarh so..

158
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:41,529
that anglo says right,, that our
country has poverty and presperation

159
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,665
but what is the reason of it

160
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:50,934
its reason is,
all kings are seprate.

161
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,901
who is guilty

162
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,576
you?
or anglo

163
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,913
in our country first 187 anglo had came..

164
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:05,846
then 2000

165
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,213
then 10000

166
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,223
then 100000

167
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:15,388
and that 100000 anglo
rules on 300000 indians..

168
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,301
do you know how

169
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,834
because they only know
how to break.

170
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,199
in the name of hunger..
and greed..

171
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,540
in the name of language

172
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,210
and we only know how
to be seprate..

173
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,577
in the name of religion,
caste..

174
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:43,760
and you know they knowledge they're
giving us,is their trap

175
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,800
They want to put their british soul
in natives.

176
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,362
for getting their thought very deeply.

177
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,638
we both brothers got in their
standard..

178
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,673

179
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,711

180
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:11,913

Her father was not agreed,
So l brought her here,

320

He will bring his wife,

329
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:36,654
Dadda!
When you were gone to take mom,

330

No!

331
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:41,767
then how did you think?

332
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,237
that your son will take his army,

333
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,001

l don't understand,
what is this nonsense,

336
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:45,285
Strange habit,
that she came here from far away,

337
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:47,220
to take animal photo shot,

338
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:50,728
Madhavgarh's political agent's
daughter have lost her mind,

339
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:53,433
Madhavgarh's political agent's
daughter?

340
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:48,317
Don't do it veer,
She is already unconsicious.

341
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,775
When Lord Ram is with us then
everything is goona be fine,

342
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:14,540
and by the way if someone else
would be on my place,

343
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,445
then he would do the same,

344
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,477
Jungle have been searched,

345
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:25,308
All soldiers have decided that
lake is the best place of check post,

346
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:30,755
We have to use check posts
like strategy,

347
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,726
what should be the reason
of our security,

348
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,627
and the death circle of Pendaris,

349
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:09,356
You have done a bravery job,

350
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,596
We drink this bravery in our tea,

351
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:19,298

ln our area....

355
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,180
we have a danger of forest area,

356
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:33,245
After cutting our soils
they escaped to ice,

357
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:37,685
like pendaris killed your people
and escape to desert,

358
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,221
and to demolish them....

359
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,955
We need long distance shooter tanks,

360
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,427
that's why we were going
to Viday Nagar,

361
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,670
We have decided that this time
we will enter in ice,

362
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,772
and we will make those
robber's grave their,

363
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,271
Nice to meet you,

364
01:26:58,246 --> 01:26:59,611
Nice to meet you too.

365
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:06,648
Me too.

366
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,289
Excuse me,

367
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,191
No problem!

368
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:17,422
When some of our own raise
his hand to shake hand with me,

369
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,360
then that moment reminds me,

370
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:23,802
when that pendari cut my hand,

371
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:27,365
then l feel happy to think
about that moment,

372
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,211
When l will cut his head,

373
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,382
because l never forgot my enemies,

374
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,250
l never forget my enemies either,

375
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,758
l take out his quarter of meat
from anywhere l catch him,

376
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,232
l don't miss that quarter too,

377
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,867
Amazing!
l have learn another lesson,

378
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,498
l promise you,

379
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,536
that l won't left single piece
on enemy's body,

380
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,848
He handled the situation that
everyone has relaxed,

381
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:28,429
What do you call in hindi?

382
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,366
Veer!

383
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,929
You learn all this for me,

384
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,449
l send message for Prince 2
days earlier,

385
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:32,793
He didn't come to meet me,

386
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,955
He was gone with Angela that day,

387
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:38,524
now where he is?

388
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:45,895
You are learning so soon,
You are playing in right tone,

389
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,388
But l.....

390
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,521
What do you think?

391
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:09,194
l am watching what you're showing,

392
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:11,294
Enough!

393
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:13,890
When angela will know the truth,

394
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:16,494
what is truth?

395
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,571
Why don't you understand my problem,

396
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,644
Your promise is fulfilled,
Now go from here,

397
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:31,576
How could?
How could l go?

398
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,216
Your father has invited me,

399
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:36,886
of your wedding ceremony,

400
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:43,586
before tomorrow evening,

401
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:46,331
if you didn't leave Madhavgarh,

402
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:50,359
then l will do the same what a
Yuvraki have to do till yet,

403
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:57,361
So veer didn't go,

404
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:04,904
Respected Father,
l have committed a sin,

405
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:07,213
From my emotions,

406
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:09,282
l forgot my duty,

407
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:12,278
Kunwar Mahinder Pratab Singh
is Veer.

408
01:38:12,686 --> 01:38:14,278
Your Yashudhara,

409
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:21,279
That letter,

410
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:23,186
not letter,

411
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:25,691
these are my army details.

412
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,920
Thank God.

413
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:40,206
When....

414
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:43,274
....they could enter in ice
behind their enemies in winter,

415
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,274
then why we wan't go to desert,

416
01:39:46,914 --> 01:39:49,246
that's why we gather the collusion
army with our army

417
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:52,911
and send them to desert,

418
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:56,355
You can't see enything after 12 yards.

419
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:59,219
Desert storm can kill our army,

420
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,290
these conditions applies to Pendaris,

421
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:10,396
l hope they didn't come out
in desert storm,

422
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,370
lt is the right time,

423
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:14,305
to find their hide outs,

424
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:18,375
and to kill unaware and
unarmed Pendaris,

425
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:54,781
Why do you understand my feelings,

426
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:58,780
Who have to understand he....

427
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:03,619
Madhavgarh is in danger,

428
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,318
Return me that letter,

429
01:41:07,394 --> 01:41:09,191
but l gave that letter to Veer.

430
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:10,728
What?

431
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:23,537
l hid this truth from you,

432
01:41:24,878 --> 01:41:27,312
because my emotions about him...

433
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:39,282
l have understand your plans,

434
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:50,603
Pendari's hand is not a hand
but it's iron,

435
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,531
You will be tired,

436
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:08,183
You made watch on my wrist,

437
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:11,223
Now my good time has decided,

438
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:26,933
Truth is your love or conspiracy,
what should l suppose,

439
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:29,275
My dadda has sent bengal for you,

440
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:39,476
Tell me one thing,

441
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:43,987
lf you have to choose one from me
and your dadda,

442
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:45,651
then who you will choose?

443
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:48,793
l will choose truth,

444
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:50,557
lf your father is true,

445
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,959
he is good then everyone
supports him,

446
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,563
But if father is wrong,

447
01:42:57,404 --> 01:42:58,598
then what should a child do?

448
01:42:59,406 --> 01:43:00,304
Should he leave him,

449
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:02,772
Nor leave him
neither support him,

450
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:06,276
bring him on right path,
What path we should show him,

451
01:43:06,613 --> 01:43:08,342
they shouldn't pay their emperor duty,

452
01:43:08,949 --> 01:43:11,315
they shouldn't transfer their royality
to their next generation.

453
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:16,879
To cheat and kill 4500 Pendaris,

454
01:43:17,925 --> 01:43:19,256
that's what you call to fulfill duty,

455
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:24,228
To turn madhavgarh british slave,

456
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:25,829
ls it trasnferring their royality.

457
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:31,837
Your state have no danger
from Pendaris.

458
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:35,238
but from your own father,

459
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:40,473
lf that time your father would
have fulfill his promise,

460
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:43,273
then circumstances would
be change today.

461
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:47,546
What oath you took for your
state's goodness,

462
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:52,725
l will support you to fulfill it,

463
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:55,857
Mark my words,

464
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:58,395
Your army will be save.

465
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,200
Pendari's won't attack until.

466
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:06,168
you attack them first,

467
01:44:09,276 --> 01:44:10,243
This bengal...

468
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:12,935
now l will wear you.

469
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:17,483
When you will have courage
to speak truth.

470
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:22,379
ln front of entire world,

471
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:25,287
you will call me VEER.

472
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:30,287
We will meet again.

473
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:45,673
How do l call you veer?

474
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:05,512
Lucky Bastard!

475
01:47:07,788 --> 01:47:10,723
When they both are in my arms,

476
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:14,327
then notjust Madhavgarh l can
win entire world.

477
01:47:14,394 --> 01:47:17,591
Leave the world.
Ask Veer,

478
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:20,332
Did he won Princess,

479
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:24,331
What are you asking him?
Ask me,

480
01:47:24,638 --> 01:47:27,300
Man should have balls.

481
01:47:40,554 --> 01:47:42,818
To all Pendari Brothers.

482
01:47:43,256 --> 01:47:45,224
who are not between us anymore,

483
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:49,818
Veer!
you mean to say....

484
01:47:50,363 --> 01:47:51,887
....that we don't have to fight war,

485
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:54,256
We have to rust our swords.

486
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:56,266
We have to wait in this hot weather,

487
01:47:58,405 --> 01:48:00,202
First check it out what's
running in veer's mind,

488
01:48:02,342 --> 01:48:04,401
Do we have shit in our minds,

489
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:07,441
that we will listen this young boy,

490
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:11,882
lf decision would be made from swords,
so we shouldn't lost our brothers.

491
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:15,185
New point of view,

492
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:18,283
Veeru came from abroad to
take new vision.

493
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:23,786
Only veer will take the decisions of
this war.

494
01:48:34,207 --> 01:48:35,265
25 years ago....

495
01:48:35,742 --> 01:48:38,472
You have trusted Prithvi and send
him to meet King,

496
01:48:39,379 --> 01:48:42,314
and our 4500 Pendaris were cheated,

497
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:46,384
and today you are committing another
mistake to believe on his son.

498
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,481
This young boy,

499
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:52,315
studied in abroad,

500
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:54,722
now he will decide our destiny,

501
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:02,861
He just studied from there,

502
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:05,634
He is not white man's son,

503
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,804
He is your son.

504
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:12,278
but your son scared and ran
away from white people,

505
01:49:22,656 --> 01:49:24,317
Let me see,

506
01:49:25,191 --> 01:49:29,287
What's running in his mind since
many years, what do you mean?

507
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:33,296
They couldn't cheat us if l would
go to take letter,

508
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,692
l would kill that king there,
but you escaped from there,

509
01:49:36,937 --> 01:49:38,302
Coward!

510
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:41,470
You are abusing my dadda.

511
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:54,284
l will bury you here.

512
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,212
Start digging,
l will see who will bury whom,

513
01:49:57,324 --> 01:49:58,757
Don't forget your words.

514
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:01,554
lf you are the Prithvi's son...

515
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:05,592
....then only our death will decide it,

516
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:12,368
Shut up!

517
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:13,936
He is just a fool.

518
01:50:14,407 --> 01:50:16,272
Why we pendaris fighting with
each other.

519
01:50:24,384 --> 01:50:26,852
This battle will happen,
and whoever will survive.

520
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:30,215
that will decide the destiny
of 15000 pendaris.

521
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:52,897
You have abused my dadda.

522
01:52:47,026 --> 01:52:51,429
Everyone take your place behind
Madhavgarh's mountains.

523
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:05,402
Dadda! we will meet again when
l will marry Yashodhara.

524
01:53:17,891 --> 01:53:21,349
Today is the special day for Madhavgarh.

525
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:53,324
Just give me the identity of
that pendari once,

526
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:57,893
then you better watch what will l
do with the killer of your brother,

527
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:14,331
Whoever Prince will defeat
this Giant warrior,

528
01:55:15,308 --> 01:55:17,469
that will marry with Yuvraghi,

529
01:56:16,936 --> 01:56:18,403
ls any real man here,

530
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:22,269
l have to see how much a
Rajput's blood can boil.

531
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:47,382
Rajput's blood is warmed,
if itjust touch you,

532
01:57:47,794 --> 01:57:49,591
then white skin will become black,

533
02:01:42,495 --> 02:01:43,792
l am Veer.

534
02:01:45,331 --> 02:01:48,528
Prithvi Singh's son,
and a pendari.

535
02:02:59,438 --> 02:03:01,736
l will chop you in pieces like....

536
02:03:07,813 --> 02:03:08,541
Child!

537
02:03:09,248 --> 02:03:10,340
From this one hand,

538
02:03:11,283 --> 02:03:13,217
don't know how many hours
l bruned,

539
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:16,588
l made you sleep from one hand,

540
02:03:17,823 --> 02:03:21,384
that's why l still followed
a father's path.

541
02:03:22,661 --> 02:03:26,392
but for me veer's path is
her religion.

542
02:03:46,285 --> 02:03:49,277
Yashudhara is prithvi singh's daughter
in law and veer's wife.

543
02:03:50,823 --> 02:03:52,688
lf someone will try to harm her,

544
02:03:53,626 --> 02:03:55,389
then veer will bring disaster,

545
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:58,363
what earth quake couldn't bring,

546
02:04:01,333 --> 02:04:02,459
Calm down,

547
02:04:08,307 --> 02:04:10,673
and we learned betray from you.

548
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:15,336
We have come to Madhavgarh for
preparation, our half army has gone

549
02:04:15,648 --> 02:04:17,513
to forest,
we have broken your all tanks.

550
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:20,585
and look at this you have no way out,

551
02:04:23,889 --> 02:04:25,186
Do you hear this sound.

552
02:04:25,691 --> 02:04:27,488
Listen to this sound carefully.

553
02:04:33,365 --> 02:04:35,492
Pendaris have surrounded Madhavgarh,

554
02:04:35,935 --> 02:04:37,698
behind long castle walls.

555
02:04:38,404 --> 02:04:40,338
now you can't be secure anymore,

556
02:04:40,706 --> 02:04:43,402
Sooner or later you will
have to open the doors.

557
02:04:43,776 --> 02:04:45,368
for food and water,

558
02:04:45,678 --> 02:04:49,409
and if you won't open them then your
thirsty and hunger people will eat you.

559
02:04:51,851 --> 02:04:54,251
Who will cut who?
l will see.

560
02:05:29,655 --> 02:05:32,715
We didn't gave you lead that you
think about british people.

561
02:05:33,259 --> 02:05:34,783
l am not think about british.

562
02:05:35,661 --> 02:05:37,629
l am thinking about entire country.

563
02:05:40,232 --> 02:05:42,928
Veer!
how did this country come,

564
02:05:44,303 --> 02:05:45,327
This was is ours.

565
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:47,329
this country is ours too.

566
02:05:50,409 --> 02:05:52,240
l understand one thing in england,

567
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:54,740
that nothing will happen to
kill few british soldiers.

568
02:05:55,414 --> 02:05:58,406
We have to remove them from country.
then let's remove them,

569
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:00,309
let's remove them from entire country.

570
02:06:01,253 --> 02:06:03,721
We will remove 2000 here,
and 10000 will escape from there.

571
02:06:04,323 --> 02:06:05,654
Sardar!
notjust white in fight,

572
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:10,260
notjust all rajas, pendaris and
madhavgarh's army will be cut,

573
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:15,401
but all thousands of innocent will
be die who lives in castle.

574
02:06:15,401 --> 02:06:18,802
When we can get Madhavgarh
without fight then why blood shed.

575
02:06:19,305 --> 02:06:22,274
then what should l do?

576
02:06:22,942 --> 02:06:24,842
like you want.
that Raja and Frazer

577
02:06:25,377 --> 02:06:29,211
l give them all safe passage.

578
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:32,307
What a solution they found
to escape from here.

579
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:35,350
l need blood in Madhavgarh,

580
02:06:35,588 --> 02:06:39,490
They put our brothers in fire.

581
02:06:39,658 --> 02:06:40,852
Did you forgot that?

582
02:06:50,302 --> 02:06:51,394
What do you think?

583
02:06:52,404 --> 02:06:53,735
lf we will spare them,

584
02:06:54,907 --> 02:06:56,374
then they won't betray us again.

585
02:06:57,743 --> 02:06:59,301
They won't fight back.

586
02:07:00,746 --> 02:07:02,304
and then there will be no casualities.

587
02:07:03,248 --> 02:07:05,512
they will betray and attack too.

588
02:07:08,354 --> 02:07:09,321
we will have casualities.

589
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:13,822
but then we will have casualities not
for revenge but that will be goal.

590
02:07:14,326 --> 02:07:15,657
that will be for country.

591
02:07:16,362 --> 02:07:17,294
Think about it.

592
02:07:18,263 --> 02:07:20,163
lf we will spare them today,

593
02:07:20,633 --> 02:07:22,260
if they will bring huge army back.

594
02:07:22,835 --> 02:07:25,633
then we have our strength but
we will have

595
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:27,330
Madhavgarh's entire army,

596
02:07:27,873 --> 02:07:29,272
and nation of Madhavgarh.

597
02:07:29,575 --> 02:07:32,601
and all these rajas will be aware

598
02:07:33,245 --> 02:07:35,304
and they will realise that
they are only slaves.

599
02:07:35,814 --> 02:07:37,281
then death....

600
02:07:37,883 --> 02:07:41,250
...won't be death that will be
martyry.

601
02:07:41,887 --> 02:07:43,684
and that will burn entire country.

602
02:07:47,226 --> 02:07:48,523
Today we have chance,

603
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:52,931
someone must have to flash light.

604
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:57,632
and how do we lose this chance,

605
02:07:59,238 --> 02:08:02,230
because the revenge of 4500 pendaris

606
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:08,907
will be done from to kill that raja
and his every white supporter.

607
02:08:10,416 --> 02:08:12,179
then l am giving you my words.

608
02:08:13,519 --> 02:08:16,613
l will cut raja and his
every white supporter,

609
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:18,315
or l will die.

610
02:08:23,295 --> 02:08:24,319
Veer!

611
02:08:25,664 --> 02:08:28,189
How a pendari shall take
his words back.

612
02:08:36,408 --> 02:08:37,807
When it's the matter of country.

613
02:08:38,944 --> 02:08:40,844
then you can't take your words back.

614
02:08:47,853 --> 02:08:49,184
then in Mahabharat....

615
02:08:50,456 --> 02:08:52,390
...why Pitama didn't take
his words back.

616
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:57,388
then fine.
Tomorrow morning,

617
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,922
decision will be made between
Prithvi and Veer.

618
02:09:28,327 --> 02:09:30,454
Pendari never cries.

619
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:49,203
l want to win too.

620
02:09:50,249 --> 02:09:51,443
Your wife....

621
02:09:52,217 --> 02:09:55,311
...want to spend her entire
life with you.

622
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:19,288
We will meet back.

623
02:13:50,355 --> 02:13:51,219
Dadda!

624
02:13:52,290 --> 02:13:53,985
Your son is not such a big veer,

625
02:13:55,627 --> 02:13:57,857
who could walk this way of religion,

626
02:14:12,577 --> 02:14:14,204
You are on right path,

627
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:16,305
Pick up the sword.

628
02:14:17,516 --> 02:14:19,416
Don't let world give a chance,

629
02:14:20,419 --> 02:14:23,411
that you are not dadda's son,

630
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:26,957
You pay your duty.

631
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:30,660
and let me fulfill the promise
what l gave to Pendaris.

632
02:15:13,505 --> 02:15:16,497
Winner will takes all.

633
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:46,857
l won't let this claim to you,

634
02:17:47,993 --> 02:17:50,188
that a father killed his son,

635
02:17:50,662 --> 02:17:53,290
and l won't let you live with burdon,

636
02:17:53,999 --> 02:17:56,729
that people say that a son
killed his father.

637
02:20:08,233 --> 02:20:10,201
You were fighting to
save these traitors.

638
02:20:10,468 --> 02:20:12,299
You were fighting with us for them,

639
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:13,262
No!

640
02:20:14,773 --> 02:20:16,365
l was fighing for that.

641
02:20:20,912 --> 02:20:23,608
He is fighting for us,
British are not ours.

642
02:20:23,882 --> 02:20:25,679
We have to remove them from lndia.

643
02:22:23,868 --> 02:22:25,802
You are very greedy of land,

644
02:22:28,806 --> 02:22:30,467
Where you need land?

645
02:22:34,012 --> 02:22:35,445
l won't give you land,

646
02:22:37,282 --> 02:22:39,944
because whenever rajas like
you get the land,

647
02:22:41,386 --> 02:22:42,614
country become slave,

648
02:23:48,553 --> 02:23:51,317
One day only one flag will be
in entire lndia.

649
02:24:38,569 --> 02:24:39,661
Tell Mom,

650
02:24:41,572 --> 02:24:42,971
We will meet again,

651
02:24:46,544 --> 02:24:47,943
you don't go anywhere.

652
02:24:51,616 --> 02:24:52,913
l will be back.

653
02:26:09,393 --> 02:26:10,917
and now my veer's son,

654
02:26:11,295 --> 02:26:14,264
is heading towards with that
freedom light.

655
02:26:37,255 --> 02:26:38,620
Pendari gave his words.

656
02:26:39,824 --> 02:26:40,756
why he couldn't come back.

657
02:26:47,865 --> 02:26:49,958
l am still better than your mom,

658
02:26:50,601 --> 02:26:51,693
Where is dadda?

659
02:27:42,687 --> 02:27:43,654
l told you,

660
02:27:43,988 --> 02:27:45,922
one day l will must throw
you in this water.

661
02:27:48,259 --> 02:27:51,194
l was waiting for this moment since
many years.

662
02:27:54,398 --> 02:27:56,764
Pendari never cries.

663
02:27:57,835 --> 02:27:58,824
l know.

664
02:28:01,205 --> 02:28:02,229
but today let me cry.
