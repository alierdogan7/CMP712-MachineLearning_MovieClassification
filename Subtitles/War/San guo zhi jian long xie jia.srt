1
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,629
228 AD

2
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,474
It was a time when China was divided
between three kingdoms, Wei, Wu and Shu

3
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,593
The country was plagued by constant war while
its people suffered from hardship and famine

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,988
It was from this turmoil that a hero would arise

5
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,835
His name was Zilong of Shu Kingdom

6
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,640
I vow to guard Phoenix Heights. To my death

7
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,990
I vow to capture Zilong alive today

8
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,919
We only have one life to live

9
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,153
I, Pingan

10
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,868
shall dream big

11
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,275
and aspire

12
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,999
after success

13
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,194
Just as a dog needs to find a good master

14
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,351
So had I chosen to join Liu's forces

15
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,470
It was there that I met Zilong

16
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,156
Your home village?.

17
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,317
Changshan

18
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,711
Your name?.

19
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,796
Zilong

20
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,518
How long have you been away from home?.

21
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,110
Almost two years

22
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,473
Why do you want to join Liu's army?.

23
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,431
To bring peace

24
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,593
to our land and start a family

25
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,835
Do you think we can win?.

26
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,790
I believe that man can prevail over destiny

27
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,551
"Changshan Zhao Zilong"

28
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,834
This is the frontline of Liu's army

29
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,949
Cao's army is much stronger and determined to
eliminate Liu

30
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,915
Liu rushes the fortress fortification

31
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,549
while we wait for backup forces

32
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,996
I am here

33
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,518
Then where is Changshan?. It must be here

34
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,839
Changshan's not there at all

35
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,115
You fool...

36
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,515
You should know more about your own country

37
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,476
Changshan is here

38
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,797
This bread is tasteless

39
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,674
I am from Changshan, too

40
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,874
We are now here

41
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,076
If we fight for our Lord Liu
and make a circle on this map

42
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,239
Peace will finally come to our country

43
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,914
And we can return to Changshan as heroes

44
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,997
Can we really encircle so much territory?.

45
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,471
Young man, you stick with me your brother

46
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,913
And I'll lead you to complete that circle

47
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,436
Brother

48
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,275
How long have you been in the army?.

49
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,150
Five years

50
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,797
Do you ever miss home?.

51
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,389
Who wouldn't?.

52
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,230
But I've never been back

53
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,029
A man must dream big

54
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,798
And aspire after great achievements

55
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,757
I swore not to return home unless with glory

56
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,070
Brother.....

57
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,511
Consider this a gift to you

58
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,792
For me?.

59
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,992
The map is in my heart

60
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,948
"When the fort falls Annihilation follows"

61
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,790
-Look, what's in the box?.

62
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,757
-How would I know?.

63
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,995
And who is that man?.

64
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,517
-What's the matter?.

65
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,630
It's Pingan!

66
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,074
-Strange things happened

67
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,669
A wooden box was left outside the front gate

68
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,990
And there's someone sent by Lord Liu

69
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,316
Is he the reinforcement?.

70
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,110
Does he look like one?.

71
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,876
How many people did he bring with him?.

72
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,150
He came alone

73
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,312
Alone?.

74
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,589
The main force of Cao's army

75
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,195
will attack us within the next few days

76
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,555
So they won't wait long

77
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,117
Cao's army will attack us tomorrow

78
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,319
What should we do......?.

79
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,110
There must be four thousand men in the Cao's
camp

80
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,554
Definitely not less than eight thousand

81
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,076
How can you be so sure?.

82
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,390
At ten men per cooking stove

83
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,749
Cao's army has lit over a thousand stoves to
cook a meal

84
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,269
That makes ten thousand troops?.

85
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,111
I didn't want to scare you with the numbers

86
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,957
Then we are doomed

87
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,071
Cao's ten thousand men is nothing

88
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,673
Cao is a master in the art of war
but he is skeptical by nature

89
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,716
His troops could have traveled 25 miles a day

90
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,039
But now they're traveling only 8 miles a day

91
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,394
It is obvious that he has his concerns

92
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,472
What concerns would a dog like Cao have?.

93
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,192
He is afraid of someone in our army

94
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,277
Who is that?.

95
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,754
Liu's Military Advisor

96
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,272
Zhuge!

97
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,074
Battle and chess are similar

98
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,988
Instead of hanging onto every chess piece
and playing defensively

99
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,038
One must know when to sacrifice a rook

100
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,354
to take the opponent's king

101
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,390
So to live, we must give up this camp

102
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,595
Can we win?.

103
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,519
Would I come to die if we can't win?.

104
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,390
Like playing chess it's better to lose the rook
than the game

105
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,311
We shall head off their attack by hitting them
tonight

106
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,989
But we only have one thousand men

107
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,556
It can't be done except tonight

108
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,717
I predict that at midnight tonight
there will be a thunderstorm

109
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,710
This presents us a great opportunity

110
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,759
But do you have enough courage to act on it?.

111
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,429
We the Changshan soldiers are made of
courage

112
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,149
But what if it doesn't rain?.

113
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,669
Should there be no rain at midnight tonight
I shall be beheaded

114
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,835
Zhuge!

115
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,036
Hurry to the Cao's camp before it rains

116
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,592
490 of us shall form the Dragon unit. Wait in
ambush at the left of Cao's camp

117
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,635
Another 490 of Tiger unit
wait in ambush at the right of Cao's camp

118
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,555
The remaining 20 Changshan soldiers will be
the commando unit

119
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,874
We will force our way through Cao's camp with
the rain as signal

120
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,270
When the enemy is in disarray because of the
storm

121
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,231
We will cut down the enemy's general flag

122
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,909
and sap their fighting spirit

123
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,037
Then Dragon and Tiger units will attack together

124
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,509
Despite their numbers, we shall have our victory

125
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,031
Life is like a game of chess
It takes only a single move to win

126
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,796
The battle is over
I shall be off to rescue other places

127
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,918
My Changshan brothers, attack!

128
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,676
Attack!

129
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,949
"Vanguard"
I will kill the vanguard's leader

130
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,111
Brother

131
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,116
Brother, I'll help you

132
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,157
Brother....

133
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,196
The leader has been killed

134
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,149
Dragon unit! Attack!

135
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,310
Tiger unit! Attack!

136
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,390
I shall launch another attack

137
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,197
Zilong has never told anyone about helping me

138
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,792
And I received all the credit

139
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,954
The defeat of Cao's forces enraged Cao. He
decided to personally lead a massive army

140
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,270
He vow to defeat Liu

141
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,350
As Cao's army was drawing near

142
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,196
Liu was chased to Phoenix Heights

143
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,356
with his people

144
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,518
Liu's blood brothers, Generals Guan Yu and
Zhang Fei

145
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,991
Were sent to cover the people's retreat

146
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,635
My people are suffering because of me.
Advisor, what is your suggestion?.

147
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,191
My Lord Liu, a proper result
can't be obtained from my divination

148
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,878
Our success in killing the Cao's vanguard
earned me the trust of the Advisor

149
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,789
And the important duty of protecting Liu's family

150
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,758
was assigned to me

151
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,592
Finally, the opportunity to prove my might had
come

152
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,915
As for Zilong, I sent him to assist the refugees

153
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,398
-Brother, what should we do?.

154
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,430
-Let's go back the way we came

155
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,678
Brother, are you sure?.
We need to be more careful

156
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,831
Back the way we came I said!

157
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,069
Yes, Brother!

158
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,471
I saw a Cao army unit coming after us

159
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,997
My Lord!

160
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,236
Cao's forces shall be here in no time

161
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,879
We must close the front gate at once

162
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,149
The gate can't be closed!

163
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,312
Your wives and child have yet to arrive

164
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,470
We must protect the people

165
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,277
Brother

166
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,231
Shut the gate!

167
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,668
Cao's army is approaching, save yourself!

168
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,713
Come in quickly, we're closing the gate

169
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,596
Zilong!

170
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,631
Brother! Brother!

171
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,510
We were attacked by Cao's soldiers

172
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,356
Where are the two ladies and the young lord?.

173
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,151
I've lost them

174
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,550
Brother, Zhang Fei!

175
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,430
How dare you to defy me?.

176
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,955
To kill him, you'll have to kill me first

177
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,072
Stop it!

178
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,237
Brother, Zhang Fei!

179
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,831
You brat!

180
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,199
Your skill was outstanding, young man

181
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,877
Brothers, lay down your weapons

182
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,556
My people are suffering because of me

183
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,309
I am to be blamed for all this

184
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,475
I'm willing to go look for
the young lord on behalf of Pingan

185
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,438
Bestow my armor upon this young man

186
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,997
Young man

187
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,032
We will clear the way for you

188
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,712
Great!

189
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,709
Eat well and fight with a full stomach

190
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,077
Brother, don't worry about me

191
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,029
I have nothing to lose

192
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,033
I came with nothing and shall leave nothing

193
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,235
There's nothing to worry about

194
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,279
I want you to complete

195
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,794
the circle without me

196
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,433
Promise me

197
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,390
you'll finish it?.

198
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,390
You coward!

199
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,675
Don't talk rubbish!

200
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,279
Remember, ride swiftly and carefully

201
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,351
Bring back the young lord

202
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,593
I believe that man

203
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,388
can prevail over destiny

204
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,635
Go, bring the royal family

205
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,754
Will we have the chance to see each other
again?.

206
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,359
When our missions are accomplished

207
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,229
we shall meet again

208
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,636
Behold, I am the great General Zhang

209
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,479
Who dares to challenge me to a duel?.

210
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,436
My little granddaughter Cao Ying,
One day you shall be a leader

211
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,155
Therefore you need to study the art of war

212
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,831
Cao

213
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,394
Brother Zhang Fei, let's go

214
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,070
Sir

215
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,674
our vanguard was attacked

216
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,995
and had to withdraw

217
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,913
They killed Liu's wives but failed to find his son

218
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,310
I'm counting on you

219
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,549
Capture that man!

220
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,358
Yes, Lord Cao

221
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,878
Regardless of my success or failure
in rescuing the young lord

222
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,469
Please spare Pingan of any punishment

223
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,391
Cao Ying, there is no mercy in war

224
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,029
Everyone you see down there
are nothing but chess pieces

225
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,391
I would rather fail everyone in the world

226
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,799
than to allow them to fail me

227
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,788
Send out a chariot to catch the man!

228
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,675
Grandfather!

229
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,831
Stop!

230
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,469
What is your name, mighty warrior?.

231
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,389
Zilong of Changshan

232
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,471
Zilong

233
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,193
One day, you will be captured by me

234
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,635
Only if you live long enough

235
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,109
Zilong made a name for himself

236
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,594
With the rescue of the young lord

237
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,751
We must gain big credits

238
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,468
I envied him

239
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,070
Finally Changshan had its hero

240
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,716
He returned to Changshan with glory

241
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,078
Zilong was invited by his townmen

242
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,354
Zilong, our hero

243
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,034
He returned to Changshan with glory. We have
something special for you

244
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,116
Yes, it's very good

245
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,037
This way please

246
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,993
Here comes our mighty warrior!

247
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,475
I am Zao Zilong!

248
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,994
Watch out for my sword!

249
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,030
Beware of my spear!

250
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,671
Wretch

251
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,873
How could you drop our great hero Zilong?.

252
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,429
It's alright, it happens

253
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,272
How can Zilong lose?.

254
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,238
At least it shouldn't happen in our hands

255
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,509
Continue with the music

256
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,116
Why don't you eat?.

257
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,877
Who knows when I can cook for you again?.

258
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,031
Lord Liu said our country will unite soon

259
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,198
My work will be done then

260
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,550
I'll come back for you

261
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,116
And we'll never be apart again

262
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,071
I'll wait for you

263
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,149
Come, let's eat

264
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,795
"East West South North"

265
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,117
"May we meet and never part again"

266
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,276
I made this for you

267
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,472
Carry it with you

268
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,518
It means no matter how fast or far you go

269
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,998
You'll always find your way back to me

270
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,637
Zilong was both brave and wise

271
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,037
And never lost a battle against Cao's army

272
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,477
Finally he became one of the Five Tiger
Generals

273
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,712
And earned wide respect and praise from his
people

274
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,679
The world long united must divide
The long divided must unite

275
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,873
All the three warlords wished to become
the Emperor of a unified China

276
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,390
Liu became the emperor of his newly found

277
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,989
Shu Kingdom

278
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,518
The country had been more chaotic than ever

279
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,512
At His Majesty's command

280
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,870
The title Forward General is conferred upon
Guan Yu

281
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,873
He is to lead 1 00 thousand troops

282
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,390
To guard against Sun of Eastern Kingdom of
Wu

283
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,759
Guan Yu, at His Majesty's service

284
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,749
At His Majesty's command

285
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,396
The title Right General is conferred upon Zhang
Fei

286
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,273
He is to lead 1 00 thousand troops

287
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,109
To guard against Cao of Northern Kingdom of
Wei

288
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,189
At His Majesty's command

289
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,836
The title Left General is conferred upon Ma

290
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,237
He is to lead 50 thousand troops
to guard Xichuan

291
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,715
At His Majesty's command

292
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,356
The title Guard General is conferred upon
Huang

293
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,073
He is to lead 50 thousand troops

294
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,715
To guard Zhongjun

295
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,959
At His Majesty's command

296
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,438
The title of Flying General is conferred upon
Zilong

297
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,799
He is to lead the rest of the army

298
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,630
To go on the north expedition against Cao

299
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,479
I hereby further bestow upon General Zilong
The title Chief Vanguard

300
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,509
He and his troops are to set off today

301
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,593
for the northern expedition against Cao

302
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,514
Zilong of Changshan at His Majesty's service

303
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,759
Pingan of Changshan at His Majesty's service

304
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,518
The Five Tiger Generals went off

305
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,755
in service of Liu and his people

306
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,837
Over the next twenty years

307
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,838
Only to fall one by one

308
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,436
First

309
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,836
the brave Guan Yu

310
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,997
Next, the strong Zhang Fei

311
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,429
They fought valiantly against the enemies of
peace

312
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,588
Soon the only Five Tiger General left standing

313
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,440
It was Zao Zilong

314
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,634
Our late Emperor Liu had ascended
to heaven amid his great agenda

315
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,310
Over the years I've launched numerous
northern expeditions but all in vain

316
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,751
The Five Tiger Generals
Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma and Huang

317
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,118
Have all passed away one after the other

318
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,113
For which, I should have been punished by
death

319
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,395
However, I assist our young Emperor

320
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,996
To follow late Liu's will

321
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,315
To continue with the northern expedition

322
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,396
And to fulfill our late Liu's dream of
bringing peace to our country

323
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,758
At His Majesty's command

324
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,318
The title Dragon General
is conferred upon the son of Guan Yu

325
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,470
The title Tiger General
is conferred upon on the son of Zhang Fei

326
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,949
Together they shall depart today
for the northern expedition against Cao

327
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,390
How dare you cut in before me?.

328
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,991
My father is Guan Yu
the head of "The Five Tiger Generals"

329
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,274
I should be the one to accept the General's seal

330
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,628
I am older and a better fighter than you

331
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,559
I should be the one

332
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,870
A better fighter than me?. Are you really?.

333
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,875
Do you dare to fight me?.

334
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,635
Alright, let us fight

335
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,955
and the winner shall bear the General's Seal

336
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,472
Stop!

337
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,350
Uncle Zilong!

338
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,434
The leadership of our forces should never be
belittled

339
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,833
I have fought hundreds of battles

340
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,718
since I began serving the late Lord Liu

341
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,474
And I have never been defeated

342
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,671
How can I be excluded from the expedition?.

343
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,995
General Zilong is the sole survivor
of our great "Five Tiger Generals"

344
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,675
Also you're no longer a young soldier

345
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,148
Should anything go awry

346
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,997
Not only would your reputation be tarnished

347
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,398
But our troops would also be demoralized

348
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,950
After years of trials and tribulations

349
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,711
Just on the verge of success in unifying the
country

350
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,274
I must be included in this northern expedition

351
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,396
Zilong, at our age

352
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,670
We live by the great memories of our past

353
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,036
Do you really want to risk losing them all

354
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,390
By going on this expedition?.

355
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,515
After all these years of battle
my memories of the past have long faded

356
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,589
I want to recover those distant and blurred
memories

357
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,869
On the battlefield where they were lost

358
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,676
Prime Minister

359
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,189
this is my very last battle

360
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,072
I vow to unite the country for Liu's Kingdom

361
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,992
Zilong of Changshan at his Majesty's Service

362
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,271
General, if you insist on going to battle

363
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
Then you shall be accompanied

364
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,755
and assisted by the sons of Guan and Zhang

365
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,234
Zilong I have two pouches for you

366
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,279
When you come across the first fork in the road
Open the first pouch

367
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,230
Open the second pouch
when you run into extreme difficulties

368
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,158
Zilong of Changshan at His Majesty's service

369
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,350
Pingan of Changshan at His Majesty's service

370
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,159
General's oath has been repeated many times

371
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,597
But nothing has been done

372
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,510
We have never served together in the same unit

373
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,716
since Zilong became one of "The Five Tiger
Generals"

374
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,878
But I have always been watching him from a
distance

375
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,108
"Guan Yu"

376
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,231
"Zhang Fei"

377
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,555
"Huang"

378
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,308
"Ma"

379
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,957
This memorial tablet is reserved for you

380
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,593
I've tidied up this place long ago

381
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,556
As I knew that you would come

382
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,719
We rarely met but I truly hope

383
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,034
This is not the place where we meet next time

384
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,197
Brother....

385
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,157
Should I fail to return

386
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,030
Would you please rest my armor here?.

387
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,955
Already thinking about retiring from your career?.

388
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,558
I haven't even started mine yet

389
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,509
Brother, how long have we been in the army?.

390
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,551
20 years since you were made one of
"The Five Tiger Generals"

391
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,798
And 32 years and 4 months

392
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,596
since the time we left Changshan

393
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,591
Do you still remember what you asked me
when I first joined the army?.

394
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:06,957
I remember

395
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,952
I asked you why you wanted to join the army

396
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,797
And you said that you wanted to bring peace
and start a family

397
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,078
And yet it hasn't happened

398
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,674
Not yet

399
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,152
I've always been regarded as the one
who has achieved the least within Liu's army

400
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,799
This is your very last battle

401
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,675
Can you give me the chance

402
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,908
to finish this last mission together with you?.

403
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,956
Would you?.

404
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,551
Prime Minister instructed

405
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,599
The first pouch should be open
when we come to a fork in the road

406
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,875
Prime Minister said

407
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,796
Units of the two young Generals and General
Zilong

408
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,634
Are to split into two groups
and go separate ways

409
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,237
All troops shall proceed together

410
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,316
to seize Cao's six counties

411
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,549
How can we split our forces?.

412
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,035
Zilong at His Majesty's service

413
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,435
Though the stone-paved road is broad
it's easy to be ambushed

414
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,758
May I suggest that I take this road

415
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,638
while Zhang accompanies you on the rear

416
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,959
Allow me

417
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,271
Guan, I fear that you will be too slow

418
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,593
and fall behind enemy lines

419
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,634
Your kind offers are appreciated

420
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,079
How dare you intrude our border?.

421
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,194
At the presence of General Zilong
of the "The Five Tiger Generals"

422
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,234
I suggest you "surrender"

423
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,674
The Five Tiger Generals"

424
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,396
such antiquated fame!

425
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,759
Zilong, unless you're eager to die

426
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,953
Do you still belong to the battle field?.

427
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,874
I suggest you go home

428
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,590
And tend to trophies from your past victories

429
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,637
Son!

430
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,873
How dare you!

431
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,552
Stop! I will go!

432
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,551
Three of you, go fight with your brother

433
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,271
Back off!

434
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,310
Watch out!

435
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,230
General Han

436
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,317
the Commander has ordered
that we must follow the battle plan

437
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,158
Did you lure General Zilong into our trap as l
ordered?.

438
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,190
Yes, Commander

439
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,632
Deng, quickly find another route

440
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,031
Yes, General!

441
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,229
Deploy the war chariot!

442
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,116
Fire!

443
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,310
Fire!

444
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,596
The enemy has encircled us

445
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,388
and we can only escape westward

446
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,791
Why is the enemy lying in ambush
in these desolate mountains

447
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,628
There must be a traitor amongst us

448
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,716
Cut the nonsense!

449
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,792
Tell me, what is to our west?.

450
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,990
Phoenix Heights

451
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,399
Withdraw to Phoenix Heights!

452
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,556
Yes, General

453
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,398
Congratulation General for your success

454
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,676
I assume by now you have already
diverted Cao Ying's attention

455
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,155
For me to attack Cao's six countries

456
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,558
I've ordered Guan and Zhang to proceed
in capturing Cao's six counties without you

457
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,911
Please hold until back up arrives

458
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,915
Once they have succeeded

459
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,559
their troops would come to your aid

460
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,597
Zhuge has found out that

461
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,275
Cao Ying has mastered her grandfather's
strategy

462
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,438
And she is as scheming as her grandfather

463
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,954
General only needs to delay Cao Ying

464
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,035
Guan and Zhang shall

465
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,959
capture Cao Ying

466
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,190
General!

467
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,874
How could Prime Minister Zhuge treat you like
this?.

468
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:51,991
General! General!

469
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,314
How can he do that?.

470
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,357
I can't believe it

471
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,598
Why am I treated this way?.

472
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,676
Prime Minister Zhuge has always
followed his military agenda

473
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,230
Brother....

474
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,190
Over all these years what have we been fighting
for?.

475
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:50,797
Here they come!

476
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,553
Commander, you have foresight

477
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,831
General Zilong has chosen
to make his stand at Phoenix Heights

478
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,872
General Han, send my order to the forces in the
Six Counties

479
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,038
They are to adopt a defensive strategy and never
attack

480
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,753
So that they cannot spare time

481
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,632
to rescue their beloved General Zilong

482
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,670
To triumph over the Liu's army
we need to break their spirit

483
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,315
What better way is there
than to defeat their "lnvincible General"

484
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,439
Once we capture General Zilong

485
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,790
We shall take advantage

486
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,237
of the victory

487
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,550
Your military strategy is most impressive. I
remain at your service!

488
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,268
Dispatch the cavalry and launch an attack
immediately

489
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,636
Yes, Commander

490
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,150
Retreat!

491
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,317
We should never have underestimated our old
General Zilong

492
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,757
Commander, perhaps he was not wounded by
my son

493
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,792
Don't speculate

494
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,278
By hiding, it doesn't mean that he is hurt

495
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,118
By appearing, he could still be wounded

496
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,155
Either way, we will find out soon enough

497
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,833
I won't let your sons

498
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:44,995
died for nothing

499
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,631
My sons.....

500
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,279
Your family has made
such great contributions to the Kingdom of Cao

501
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,278
I shall request His Majesty to bestow
an honorable title on you

502
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,199
My General, please take care of yourself

503
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,958
Though you have lost four of your sons today

504
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,037
In return you've gained a daughter

505
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,556
Please take me as your daughter

506
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,831
I don't deserve such honor

507
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,230
Father!

508
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,677
My Commander

509
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,955
How could I possibly repay your great kindness

510
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,908
War is cruel

511
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,319
but the soldiers are innocent

512
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,318
Same goes for the enemy soldiers

513
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,273
Send the bodies of the enemy soldiers
back to Zilong

514
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,072
Cao Ying is truly sinister

515
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,351
Now she has managed to weaken our soldiers'
spirit What should we do?.

516
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,639
She definitely lives up
to her grandfather Cao's expectations

517
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,953
Not only with her military skills

518
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,874
but also with her scheming

519
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,189
Brother!

520
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,237
Zilong....

521
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,474
I want to give Cao Ying a gift for her
thoughtfulness

522
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,558
Here is a gift from our General to the
Commander in return for her kindness

523
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,199
Our General Zilong said that years ago

524
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,351
He took your grandfather's sword

525
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,471
and kept it

526
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,598
Today, General Zilong rewards you with it
on your grandfather's behalf

527
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,998
Hope you can learn from the past
and not lose this sword to him again

528
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,437
Take him!

529
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,759
Envoys should never be harmed in war

530
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,757
Poised as a mountain and unpredictable
like the ying and yang

531
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,557
Grandfather, General Zilong is truly a great
opponent

532
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,155
Commander!

533
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,753
Good news for you

534
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,675
The Commander of Cao's Kingdom

535
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,236
requests a duel with General Zilong of Liu's
Kingdom

536
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,436
Get my steed ready

537
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,477
General!

538
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,359
We can stall no further

539
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,308
once we show a sign of weakness

540
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,391
Minister Zhuge probably don't know We have
been surrounded by this many enemies

541
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,235
Let's hope we can stall the enemy
until our rescue force arrive

542
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,951
General Zilong, I am sure, You have been
waiting for

543
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,559
aid from Guan and Zhang

544
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,392
Here is a small gift as a token of my gratitude
for your return of my grandfather's sword

545
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,432
"Guan"

546
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,834
I wished to return the remains of Guan and
Zhang to you

547
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,033
But what was left of them
were bits and pieces far beyond recognition

548
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,273
I should have killed Cao Cao last time

549
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,155
It's all my fault

550
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,910
Even if I don't have a single man left

551
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,836
Cao's army will never be able to take over Shu
Kingdom

552
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,830
My grandfather regretted he'd never captured
you

553
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,080
Today I shall assume his challenge in honor of
him

554
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,475
Don't panic! Your big brother will save you

555
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,953
Zilong!

556
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,636
Commander!

557
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,433
Your fighting skill

558
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,795
does not match your grandfather

559
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,228
Come back when you are ready

560
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,796
-General!

561
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,190
-Go get a chair

562
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,358
Zilong......

563
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,197
General......

564
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,395
Go quickly and check on Cao Ying. Go now!

565
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,356
Allow me to remove your armor
so that I can pull out the arrow

566
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:49,116
I've never taken off my armor during battle

567
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,155
If I do, my troops will know that I'm hurt

568
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,191
And they'll be unsettled

569
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,152
Do not let Cao Ying know about it

570
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,076
Go and check

571
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,719
This is the map in your heart

572
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,118
Zilong, we've indeed come very far

573
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:17,996
Do you still remember?.

574
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,871
You said that you will make yourself
live in the hearts of the people

575
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,994
You had also said that

576
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,559
by the time we complete a circle on the map

577
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,512
We shall have peace in our country

578
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,597
But after years of battle

579
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,550
and now that we're back at Phoenix Heights

580
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,673
Do we have peace in our country?.

581
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,833
Father, are you willing to give me a hand?.

582
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,635
Commander, I am willing to pay you my debt of
gratitude

583
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,470
Great. Grant my father one hundred of our finest
horses

584
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,676
I vow to kill the enemy till my very last breath

585
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,153
Zilong, will you surrender?.

586
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,037
Surrender?.

587
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,871
They're preparing

588
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,795
for the next onslaught

589
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,110
General, we are sorry that we cannot
serve you as long as we wish

590
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,591
You have always taught us
that it's an honor for a man to die in battle

591
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,108
I will not forget to repay you for your outstanding
leadership

592
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,955
We will charge downhill to take down Cao Ying

593
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,477
We have lived as Zilong's men. And shall die as
Zilong's ghosts

594
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:11,350
General, we await for your command!

595
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,953
If I can't lead you to victory

596
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:33,148
I shall not let you die without honor

597
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,235
Listen

598
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:42,869
Go and fight for our Great Kingdom of Shu

599
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,117
I shall follow closely behind

600
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,590
I would rather fail everyone in the world
than to allow them to fail me

601
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,395
Long Live the Great Kingdom of Cao

602
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,791
Long Live the Great Kingdom of Liu!

603
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:28,114
I vow to guard Phoenix Heights to my death

604
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:34,830
It was me who informed Cao's army. And helped
Cao Ying to lead you to Phoenix Heights

605
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,958
They promised to make me a General in Cao's
army

606
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,593
I'm sorry it was me
who've betrayed you

607
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,238
Since you have betrayed me

608
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:12,992
Why did you save me
while I was fighting Cao Ying?.

609
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,235
Why?.

610
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,553
You have always called me brother

611
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,030
Yet I've gained nothing!

612
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,273
You've what it takes to be a great general

613
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,674
But I am getting nowhere

614
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,670
I've accomplished nothing all these years

615
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,228
You asked me about
what we are fighting for

616
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,475
I fought for myself

617
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:59,395
What I want is simply that when I return home

618
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:05,029
When the folks of Changshan think about
Zilong. They will also think about Pingan

619
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,632
You think I made this far

620
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,796
In fact, we have both been going around in
circles

621
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,634
I only believe that fate in within my control

622
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,115
In the end, we are all bound to fate

623
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,671
Therefore all victories and defeats no longer
matter

624
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:35,795
What is victory?.

625
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,155
There is no victory without a defeat

626
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,510
Brother....

627
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,913
Take this armor off me

628
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:56,750
It is time for me to proceed
with my last mission

629
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,957
Do you blame me
for treating you as my competitor?.

630
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,749
No, you'll always be my beloved brother

631
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:28,917
With blessings from the Buddha, I vow to
capture Zilong alive today

632
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,636
Tell the Prime Minister that I have recovered the
long lost memories of the past

633
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,756
To people of Changshan, please tell that I have
only gone

634
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,109
around in a big circle in my lifetime

635
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,349
Brother

636
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,992
Please sound the drum for me one last time

637
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,758
When our missions are accomplished

638
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,230
We shall meet again

639
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,793
Zilong!

640
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,630
That was the last time I saw Zilong

641
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,192
Years later, the three Kingdoms were finally
united

642
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,234
Not by Wei

643
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,351
Wu

644
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,430
or Shu

645
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:44,910
But under a new "Jin" Dynasty

646
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,196
How many things before and after"

647
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,955
"All melt into gossip and laughter"
