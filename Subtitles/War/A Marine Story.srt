Here's your
Pentagon Channel Report...

179
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,554
Diplomatic commitments
from Iran

180
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,118
to help stabilize and improve
the security situation

181
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:37,097
in Iraq remain unfulfilled.

182
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:39,099
That's according
to Major General...

183
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:11,262
Everybody offered me
a lift but you.

184
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,867
Looks like you
need the exercise.

185
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,759
Hey, girl.

186
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:21,672
Get him another one,
would you?

187
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:22,903
I'll have the same.

188
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,976
Will we be startin' a tab then?

189
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,840
Yeah, why not.

190
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,342
So what else is going on?

191
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,378
You seen Holly?

192
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,113
I think she's livin'
up in Fresno now,

193
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:39,718
but I haven't spoken to her
since she went off to college

194
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,728
and you went off
to get the tattoo.

195
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,787
Wow...

196
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:45,856
That's been a while then.

197
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,928
Strange how you just
lose track of people.

198
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:53,135
At least I see the flag up
once in a while.

199
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,801
That's a reminder.

200
00:14:57,945 --> 00:15:01,813
I should have stopped by
to say hello a lot sooner.

201
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,077
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,114
Ah...

203
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:08,678
You got married.

204
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,284
I did too.

205
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,427
You didn't miss much.

206
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,167
So...

207
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:22,931
When do you go back?

208
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,131
I am planning my next move...

209
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,904
I got my honorable discharge.

210
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,311
I thought they weren't
lettin' anyone out.

211
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,073
They are.

212
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:39,145
Yeah, but I thought
you were in for life -

213
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:40,778
family tradition and all.

214
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:49,455
Listen, if it has anything
to do with your marriage

215
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:51,460
to what's- his-name...

216
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,759
If he comes around here,
I'm gonna knock him down for ya.

217
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,963
He's a Navy SEAL, Leo.

218
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:59,302
Be a friggin' walrus,
I'll still knock him down.

219
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:01,471
He's not comin' around.

220
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,780
So you're out...

221
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,953
What next?

222
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,477
Exactly.

223
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:18,384
We'll have to find something
fun for you to do then.

224
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:26,926
Leo, l...

225
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,229
Hold that thought.

226
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,099
- Boys!
- Leo!

227
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:32,132
Get down here.
Somebody I want you to meet.

228
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,502
All right, guys, let's go.
To the troops!

229
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:35,868
To the troops!

230
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:40,412
- Ah!
- Yeah!

231
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,313
How would you even
know there's a war on?

232
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,874
They ain't raised taxes,
they lowered 'em.

233
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,283
Don't you read
the bumper stickers?

234
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:48,015
Yeah, and those yellow ribbons.
Those help.

235
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:52,017
So you lady Marines
all really Semper Fi and shit?

236
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,390
We're just called Marines.

237
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,759
But you still do all that
secretarial work, right?

238
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,855
They fly jets, idiot,
helicopters.

239
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,525
The only thing they
don't do is ground combat,

240
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:00,529
but that's gonna change.

241
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:03,134
Combat? No fuckin' way.

242
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,398
No offense, honey.

243
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:05,871
Try not to be a prick.

244
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:08,170
What Turk is saying,
in his graceful manner...

245
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,335
Very graceful.

246
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:12,210
...the difference between
men and women...

247
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:14,146
A gun is a great equalizer.

248
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,274
Yeah, yeah, but some jobs
men are just better at,

249
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,545
because of the muscle mass.

250
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:19,150
Muscle mass, Stenny!

251
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:21,416
It's not that women
aren't part of the team,

252
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:23,889
there's just the strength issue.

253
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:24,549
He's right.

254
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,022
There's that saying that
the strongest woman

255
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:28,289
is equal to the weakest man.

256
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,296
What?

257
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,127
It's true, so if we're
talking about combat...

258
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,894
What did you just say?

259
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,032
I didn't saying anything,
I'm just...

260
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,469
You just said that

261
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,372
the strongest woman
is equal to the weakest man?

262
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,137
Yeah.

263
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:44,303
I'd take that bet.

264
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,405
Dale, arm-wrestle her.

265
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,178
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!

266
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,309
I'm not the weakest.

267
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:53,115
You want to go
round robin on this?

268
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,382
Cut to the chase.
You're it.

269
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,049
Woo!!!

270
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,990
Come on!

271
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,186
Lt'll be like
a little science experiment.

272
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:02,195
You got her, buddy.

273
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,925
Come on, baby,
make me proud.

274
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,590
A good clean fight...

275
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:10,599
No kicking, no biting, Dale.

276
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:11,930
I got 20 on Alex.

277
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,098
I got that bet.

278
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,607
Good. Put your money
on the table.

279
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,366
- Here we go.
- Ready?

280
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,379
One, two, wrestle.

281
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:21,210
Come on!

282
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:22,579
Put her down!

283
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,217
What the hell?!

284
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:31,485
What happened?

285
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:35,222
Well, we put that
theory to rest, boys.

286
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,025
Yeah, wait, wait!

287
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:39,897
I get shot, she can't
carry me off the field.

288
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,232
I can't carry you off the field.

289
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,328
All right, let's test this with a real man.

290
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,497
A lefty!

291
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:51,305
All right, hold on, hold on.
You know what, guys?

292
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,040
I think we proved the point.

293
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,509
- Alex, my compliments.
- Thank you.

294
00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:00,216
- I'm buying.
- That's my money.

295
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:02,085
Cool!

296
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:13,160
The front line is just about
anywhere you drive a HumVee,

297
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,397
so women are
in combat every day.

298
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,234
But you can relax.

299
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:20,570
It's not gonna be
official policy any time soon.

300
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,043
I had a buddy who was a Marine,
and the women Marines...

301
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,677
well, all the other grunts
called them W. M.'s.

302
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,409
Waste of money.

303
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:35,615
- That's what he said.
- Jesus, Turk.

304
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,283
He's really not our friend.

305
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,189
- That's what he said.
- It's all right.

306
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:41,126
We have an all-volunteer military

307
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,526
that's stretched pretty thin

308
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:45,054
and they'll take pretty much
anyone they can get,

309
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:48,500
so I'd say if you're
not gonna join up,

310
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,060
you can shut the fuck up.

311
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:53,035
Well, she's got you there, bud.

312
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,702
What'd I miss?

313
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,578
Where are you going?

314
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,307
There's your difference
right there, boys...

315
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,110
Bladder the size of an acorn.

316
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,514
How's that?

317
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,989
He just decked her!

318
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,514
She shoved me!

319
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,158
What's goin' on?

320
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,495
All right, darlin', that's enough.

321
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,236
They hand out balls
to the lady Marines, too?

322
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,299
Everybody calm the hell down!

323
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,334
- Turk, stay away from her!
- Screw that,

324
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,073
I'm tired of this
toy soldier bullshit!

325
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,273
I said back off!

326
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,008
Jesus! Just chill out!

327
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,041
Go sit down.

328
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,583
Now you can hit me.

329
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:43,249
I said, sit down!

330
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,991
I'm callin' the police!

331
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,190
Turk!

332
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:55,663
Hey, Turk!

333
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,308
God!

334
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,743
(News plays on radio)

335
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:59,125
Sorry, Mom.

336
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,731
What I'm about to say is
extremely confusing to me,

337
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,330
and I'm sure will
come as a shock.

338
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,871
You're being investigated for
conduct unbecoming an officer.

339
00:22:46,313 --> 00:22:47,245
What?

340
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,249
Specifically, homosexual conduct.

341
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,842
That's absurd.

342
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:57,351
Emails describing the nature of
a relationship have been discovered.

343
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:59,325
Sir, I have sent no emails.

344
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,487
You received them -
on a military email account.

345
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:04,759
Junk mail, immediately deleted.

346
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,528
- Apparently there's other evidence.
- What evidence?

347
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:09,866
That'll come out in the hearing.

348
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:12,770
I'm just informing you that
the process is in motion.

349
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,637
But who put the
process in motion?

350
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:15,573
It doesn't matter.

351
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:18,635
Sir, I have the right
to know my accuser.

352
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,512
Doesn't work that way, Alex.

353
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,709
Look, hopefully we can
clear this up

354
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,912
when the board of inquiry
is convened.

355
00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,620
But you should know,

356
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:29,918
if they do find against you,
you might end up

357
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:31,920
with something worse than
an honorable discharge,

358
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,558
which you'd still get
if you decide

359
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:35,528
to separate before the hearing.

360
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:38,258
So, just keep that in mind.

361
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,732
Sir, with respect,
this whole thing is ridiculous.

362
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:41,860
I'm married.

363
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,665
Yes, I know.

364
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,194
It doesn't matter.

365
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:11,192
What am i doing?!

366
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:13,692
Dammit.

367
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:26,304
God dammit.

368
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,755
Anybody in there?

369
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,724
Hello?

370
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,257
Hey, Marine lady!

371
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,764
You better be home after
making me walk all this way.

372
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:57,406
Did you walk?

373
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:59,912
Or am I gonna find your car
at the bottom of the hill?

374
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,608
I walked!

375
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:02,945
OK...

376
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,876
Let's see if you're lying.

377
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:10,319
OK, so I drove.

378
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,917
I was gonna be late.

379
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:16,361
All right, now you get
to clean all the crap

380
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:18,830
off the driveway from here
to wherever your car is.

381
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,766
Yeah, right.

382
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,029
Listen, I'm here, OK?

383
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,032
So just give me
some talk or whatever.

384
00:25:24,271 --> 00:25:26,296
Talk is cheap,
but it ain't free.

385
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:30,266
Oh, my God...
You're insane.

386
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,369
No, I just know that talk
ain't gonna work

387
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:33,879
on a meth head
with an attitude problem.

388
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:35,040
I am not a meth head.

389
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:37,443
Look, you're gonna wash out
of bootcamp your very first day

390
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:39,679
and end up in
a prison cell, or worse.

391
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,017
I can get you ready,

392
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,522
but I told you I'm not
gonna waste my time.

393
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:46,390
So either give me
total submission or get gone.

394
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,597
There's a rake and
garbage bags in the garage.

395
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:11,484
What a major bitch.

396
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:16,513
Punk.

397
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,624
I got you water.

398
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:33,101
Saffron?

399
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,402
[Chuckles]

400
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:18,084
And breathe, ladies.

401
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,484
Extend through the fingertips,

402
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,613
lift the back thigh up,

403
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:25,489
opening the hips and breathe.

404
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,789
Strong pose, fire pose.

405
00:27:29,062 --> 00:27:31,826
Find some water in the pose,

406
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:34,561
find some flexibility
in the pose...

407
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:38,628
Somebody smile, somebody smile...

408
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:43,132
Extend and...
reverse crescent

409
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:47,169
and up over,
reversing the palm...

410
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,814
and looking up...

411
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,813
Breathe.

412
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:02,793
Hold the position.
[Both laugh]

413
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:04,657
The crazy thing is,

414
00:28:04,698 --> 00:28:07,189
I didn't realize
until after I enlisted.

415
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,527
At that point you kinda
keep it to yourself

416
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:11,127
if you like your job...

417
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:12,934
I loved my job.

418
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,946
God, I feel like we should go
get a drink or something...

419
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,713
I've got to go teach.

420
00:28:25,752 --> 00:28:27,982
I gotta head back anyway.

421
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,548
I just thought
I was gonna lose it

422
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,821
if I didn't tell
somebody the truth.

423
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:37,229
You can keep it a secret, right?

424
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,897
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,468
What about your family?

426
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:44,697
No, they don't need to know.

427
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:47,172
Not while my brother's deployed.

428
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,141
Not while my father's
still alive.

429
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,769
Leo?

430
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,609
This needs to stay
between us, OK?

431
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:58,811
Of course.

432
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:08,250
You know, I always
thought you had

433
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:10,224
a little crush
on me in high school.

434
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:12,928
Uh uh...

435
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,131
Oh!

436
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:21,099
Your crush on Leo didn't
do you much good, either.

437
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:22,699
No thanks to you.

438
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,207
What a confused and frustrated
little triangle that was.

439
00:29:27,247 --> 00:29:28,908
Yeah.

440
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:38,149
Hey...

441
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,250
You've got your ring
on the wrong hand.

442
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:44,792
Is that some kind of code?

443
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,025
No...

444
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,933
I just broke this finger.
It won't fit anymore.

445
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:52,766
Does your husband know?

446
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,545
I'm just here to
pay for the damages.

447
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,848
It's been taken care of.

448
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:08,846
Leo?

449
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:14,257
What's he drinkin'?

450
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,933
You rack.

451
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:30,076
I get a little dizzy bending over.

452
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:38,081
Garbage!

453
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:42,020
Garbage... is gold!

454
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:45,216
You ain't got a shot now.

455
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:52,031
Hey!

456
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,363
You forfeit the game that way.

457
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:58,896
Shooting willy nilly is silly.

458
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:02,702
Fine.

459
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,232
Forfeit then.

460
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:07,269
We don't train
to shoot half-cocked.

461
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:12,248
Half-crocked, you mean.

462
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:14,116
You're fully crocked.

463
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:18,119
I can't do it. I won't.
So, I'm going home.

464
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:19,989
And I'm not even gonna drive,

465
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:22,153
because that's just
a bigger bullet.

466
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:24,925
I salute that wise decision.

467
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:26,227
As you were.

468
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:30,333
Hang a right out the door

469
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,032
and keep walking
until you see your mailbox.

470
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:34,233
Night, Turk!

471
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:37,175
W. M...

472
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,203
stands for Walkin' Marine!

473
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:42,875
Ooo-rah!

474
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:49,888
I used to drive a Chevrolet...

475
00:31:49,923 --> 00:31:55,259
Now I'm walkin' everyday...

476
00:31:55,295 --> 00:32:01,029
I used to drive a Cadillac...

477
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:06,164
Now I'm humpin' with my pack...

478
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:09,232
(female Marines)
If i die in a combat zone...

479
00:32:09,276 --> 00:32:12,302
(Drill Instructor)
Box me up and ship me home!

480
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:33,389
Close Combat Instructor,
Drill Sergeant,

481
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:36,869
Amphibious Warfare
School graduate...

482
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,928
Top marks all around.

483
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:40,997
And a Mustang to boot.

484
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,767
Just so we're clear,

485
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,745
I don't see how
you being a lesbian

486
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,839
makes a damn bit of difference.

487
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,281
I am not a lesbian.

488
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,808
And I didn't just
ask you if you were.

489
00:32:52,852 --> 00:32:55,184
I'm just following the assumption.

490
00:32:57,123 --> 00:33:00,092
We fight side by side with the
British and they let the gays in

491
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:02,094
so, believe me,
I know how stupid this is.

492
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:03,254
Yes, sir.

493
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:06,388
Certainly you've had to deal
with this issue in your command,

494
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,094
haven't you?

495
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:10,329
I had two men tell me they
were in love with each other

496
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,235
right after September 11th.

497
00:33:12,272 --> 00:33:13,739
How did you handle it?

498
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:15,832
I told them to kiss.
They couldn't.

499
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,844
And you left it there?

500
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:22,507
They were just afraid
of what was coming.

501
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:24,376
They got over it.

502
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:26,385
So they stayed in the fight.

503
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:31,521
See, that's the issue,
right there.

504
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:34,192
If a homosexual is allowed
to stay in the fight,

505
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:35,751
maybe die in the fight,

506
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:38,093
there's no way in hell
some politician can tell 'em

507
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:40,531
who they can or can't marry.
You see what I mean?

508
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:45,932
It's not a matter of unit cohesion
or troop morale.

509
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:47,462
It's about the damn
marriage issue...

510
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,476
Respectfully,
I appreciate your insight,

511
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,411
but I really, really
don't care about this crap.

512
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,384
At ease, Major.

513
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:04,483
I just want to be
free to do my job, sir.

514
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,792
Now is not the time
to be losing any Marine,

515
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:11,296
that's certain.

516
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,390
Is there a way to
at least push this off

517
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,901
until I'm eligible for
my pension next year?

518
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:19,931
I'll see if I can
slow the wheels.

519
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:23,033
I'd appreciate whatever
you can do on my behalf, sir.

520
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,407
Got your back.

521
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,577
Dismissed.

522
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:21,060
[Giggling]

523
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:28,372
Corpsman up!

524
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,898
Corpsman!

525
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,638
You got a man down
over here...

526
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:35,244
Bone check.

527
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,873
All good.

528
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,578
Hotel, Echo, Lima, Papa!

529
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:42,213
This is Devilfish 1-2
calling medevac.

530
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:43,950
I'm hit!

531
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,420
Anybody copy?
I said I'm hit!

532
00:35:59,305 --> 00:36:01,239
Where is everybody?

533
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:09,279
Where is everybody?

534
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,365
What a bender you're on.

535
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:06,503
Well, come on in.

536
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,142
The first thing you're gonna
see when you get off the bus

537
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,516
is a line of yellow footmarks.

538
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:22,316
You put your feet on them.

539
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:24,455
Stand at attention, like this.

540
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,151
Eyes and head
straight to the front.

541
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:28,422
Don't look in my eyes.
Look straight front.

542
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,224
Do not ever make eye contact.

543
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,234
It will be late in the evening.

544
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:39,067
You will be tired and hungry
and disoriented.

545
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:40,766
And that's exactly
the way they want you,

546
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,497
because for the next few hours

547
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:45,477
every manifestation of what you
consider to be your identity

548
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:47,035
will be stripped away.

549
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,208
Your clothing, your hairstyle,
your mannerisms,

550
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:52,444
speech patterns,
bad habits, everything.

551
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:55,477
They get in your face and call
you maggot even if you're a girl?

552
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:56,783
Yes.

553
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,786
- Show me.
- No.

554
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:03,659
Sheriff said you were
a drill instructor once.

555
00:38:03,696 --> 00:38:05,129
Let's see it.

556
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,222
No.

557
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:09,795
Do it.
Call me a maggot.

558
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:11,799
You know you want to.

559
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:14,029
Ever since you saw me
you've had it out for me.

560
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:15,097
So just do it.

561
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:17,473
It's not like you haven't already
been a major bitch anyway.

562
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,408
I'm curious to see...

563
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:20,571
Curious will get you killed, recruit!

564
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:24,276
From now on, everything you
need to know I will tell you!

565
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:27,081
Everything you think
you know, you will forget!

566
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,486
Did I not just explain to you
how to stand at attention?

567
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:30,716
Shoulders back!

568
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:32,247
How old are you, Snow?

569
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,384
- Uh, 20.
- Uh? Uh?

570
00:38:34,427 --> 00:38:36,258
We do not say 'uh'
in the Marine Corps.

571
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:38,525
Uh is something you hear
from little lady meth- heads

572
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:40,054
who sell their twats for a fix.

573
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,090
You sell your twat
for a fix, Snowblind?

574
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:43,432
Uh, no...
I mean no!

575
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:45,300
You will answer me
ma'am, yes ma'am.

576
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:46,430
Do you understand me?

577
00:38:46,472 --> 00:38:48,303
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

578
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:51,310
Did it take you 20 years to
get this stupid, Snowflake?

579
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:52,436
- OK.
- Hey!

580
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:54,446
Did I tell you
to step off your marks?

581
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,505
Why are you not
standing on your marks?

582
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,414
Do you need
your fix, Snowblind,

583
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,316
or are you just ready to
run home to grandma?

584
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:03,345
All right, I get it, OK!
Stop it, stop it!

585
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:04,515
Holy shit!

586
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:12,258
I am not a meth- head!
I've never even tried it!

587
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:18,467
I'm just being hard on you

588
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:21,473
so you're not completely
unprepared for boot camp.

589
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:23,407
What I've been describing here

590
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,843
is day one
with the Marine Corps.

591
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:28,847
The Marine Corps is
the toughest, the elite.

592
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:31,875
With you I think we try Air Force.

593
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,882
Where you goin'?

594
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:37,180
Aspirin.

595
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:48,331
What's next, Major Bitch?

596
00:39:58,177 --> 00:39:59,371
That's not bad.

597
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,347
Don't stop!

598
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:03,370
You said a mile.

599
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,179
Yeah, but we gotta
time you for three.

600
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:06,913
Keep goin'!
Go, go, go!

601
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:09,212
Move! Go!

602
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:10,882
Come on, love it, do it...

603
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:13,621
Just go until your body stops.

604
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,183
Don't listen to your mind.

605
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:16,217
Good.

606
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:19,389
Come on, stay up there, stay.
Come on, come on!

607
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,530
Well, you didn't pass the
minimum physical requirements,

608
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:25,594
but you did better
than I thought you would.

609
00:40:25,638 --> 00:40:26,900
Really?

610
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:27,928
Rule number one...

611
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:29,698
Never smile within sight
of your drill Instructor.

612
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,801
You have no right looking
happy in boot camp.

613
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:34,404
And if you do look happy,
they'll remedy the situation.

614
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:39,881
Used to be a beauty queen...

615
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:42,251
Now I got my M-16...

616
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,952
They're gonna hound you all day,
make you make mistakes.

617
00:40:51,197 --> 00:40:52,528
You're gonna feel
worthless sometimes,

618
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,260
but that's the
enemy you fight.

619
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,858
You're not worthless,
you're just learning.

620
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:57,830
You OK?

621
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:00,571
Get some rest,
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

622
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:09,847
- Leo.
- Saff.

623
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:15,982
What happened to your face?

624
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:18,486
Managed to get hit
with a razor this time.

625
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:22,427
What are you doing with her?

626
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:24,326
Little project.

627
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:28,996
Well, I came over
to offer another apology

628
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:31,863
over the idiocy
that happened the other night.

629
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,735
This is the idiot maker.

630
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:35,604
How 'bout some coffee?

631
00:41:35,641 --> 00:41:37,734
- If you say so.
- C'mon.

632
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:43,548
What?

633
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:47,383
Just... memories.

634
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,446
I got a shoebox full of those.
C'mon.

635
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:09,504
Hey, you wanna ride?

636
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,533
No, thanks.
Just go on.

637
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,324
Don't slam the door.

638
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,998
Food's on the counter.

639
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:47,872
I spoke to your mother.

640
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:54,342
She said don't worry,
everyone is just fine.

641
00:42:57,323 --> 00:43:00,520
Said to make sure
I told you that.

642
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:13,801
Do you hear me?

643
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,033
Yes.

644
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:37,863
Saffron...

645
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,956
Don't worry.

646
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:43,127
Everyone is gonna be just fine.

647
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:48,500
Help is comin'...

648
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:51,510
Help is...

649
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:34,682
There's no bikes in boot camp!

650
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:38,020
Come on!
My legs are toast!

651
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:40,184
You will fall down,
but you will get up.

652
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:42,656
You will be pushed beyond
your limits, but you will comply

653
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:45,186
because you have no idea
what your limits are.

654
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:46,591
I'm at my limit.

655
00:44:46,632 --> 00:44:48,657
- Are you gonna puke?
- No.

656
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,669
Then you're nowhere
near your limit.

657
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:53,767
Come on, keep moving.
Let's go!

658
00:44:53,806 --> 00:44:56,604
- I can't...
- Can't? That's not a word.

659
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:57,609
Seriously...

660
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:59,702
Seriously, I will go full
Drill Instructor on you.

661
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:00,803
Oh, no, please don't.

662
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:03,212
Then block the mind chatter.
This is about willpower now.

663
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:04,814
Are you listening?

664
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,613
- Ears!
- Open, ma'am.

665
00:45:06,652 --> 00:45:08,620
Then take your eyes,
put them on the horizon

666
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:09,882
and go there!

667
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,485
Outstanding!

668
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:19,157
You have been a zombie maggot
your entire life,

669
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:22,224
and now thanks to your country
you're starting to wake up.

670
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:24,698
- Say thank you!
- Ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

671
00:45:24,737 --> 00:45:27,604
That's right!
Ma'am, thank you, Ma'am.

672
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,971
Don't let me
get ahead of you.

673
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:32,239
Stay in front of me
or I will own this bike.

674
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:35,013
This bike is mine!

675
00:45:43,656 --> 00:45:45,624
OK, I surrender.

676
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:47,625
Can you swim?

677
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,525
Captain of the swim team
in high school.

678
00:45:49,562 --> 00:45:51,689
Maybe we'll ship you
off to the Navy.

679
00:45:57,503 --> 00:46:00,870
So...
You're friends with Leo?

680
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:02,533
Yeah.

681
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:04,270
Uh huh.

682
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,943
Old boyfriend?

683
00:46:05,978 --> 00:46:07,639
High school.

684
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:10,575
He shaved for you.

685
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:15,520
Right.

686
00:46:18,924 --> 00:46:20,789
Is Burner your boyfriend?

687
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:24,026
I guess he was.

688
00:46:24,063 --> 00:46:25,963
They're all just boys, you know.

689
00:46:25,998 --> 00:46:27,295
I don't know what they're doin'

690
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,195
and I don't wanna take
the time to figure it out.

691
00:46:30,236 --> 00:46:32,704
I just want a little
squeeze here,

692
00:46:32,738 --> 00:46:34,638
a little massage there,

693
00:46:34,673 --> 00:46:36,265
a little exploration.

694
00:46:36,308 --> 00:46:38,003
Not all that jack-hammerin'!

695
00:46:38,744 --> 00:46:40,211
Is that too much to ask?

696
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:02,734
[Doorbell rings]

697
00:47:05,104 --> 00:47:06,765
Ahhh!

698
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:08,705
And you brought
civilization with you.

699
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:09,935
How nice.

700
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:13,075
- Should I open it?
- Yes. Quickly.

701
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:14,340
I'll get some glasses.

702
00:47:21,954 --> 00:47:23,922
You seem tense.
What's up?

703
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:28,888
I'm standing in your house...

704
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:31,294
I got dressed up...

705
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,094
I brought a gift.

706
00:47:34,133 --> 00:47:36,795
I hope you don't think
I'm hitting on you.

707
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:41,038
Are you?

708
00:47:42,308 --> 00:47:43,707
No...

709
00:47:43,742 --> 00:47:45,369
- Aww...
- Oh, God, no.

710
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:46,908
Am I?

711
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:49,676
Girl, you're a hot mess.

712
00:47:52,017 --> 00:47:53,985
It's OK to cry.

713
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:57,147
Marines don't cry;

Is this a dance club?

717
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:09,890
Can be.

718
00:48:10,903 --> 00:48:12,632
There aren't any men in here.

719
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:16,767
I know...
Every night is ladies night.

720
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:20,006
- Someone might see us.
- That's the whole idea.

721
00:48:20,879 --> 00:48:22,870
Let's go!

722
00:48:22,915 --> 00:48:26,009
You've never been
in a gay bar before.

723
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,780
Of course not.

724
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:33,023
But you've mingled...
with the ladies.

725
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:35,017
Tequila!

726
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,891
Whoa, sailor, relax.

727
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:38,897
We're just here
to meet a friend.

728
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:43,091
I don't want to meet anybody.
Let's just go.

729
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:43,965
Relax.

730
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:46,870
It's just someone
I work with at the yoga studio.

731
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:48,702
Oh! There she is.

732
00:48:57,816 --> 00:48:59,283
Then you became a what?

733
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:02,048
A Deputy Provost Marshall.

734
00:49:02,087 --> 00:49:03,714
It's like a cop.

735
00:49:03,756 --> 00:49:05,189
Oh...

736
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,027
Iraq is mostly about policing now.

737
00:49:11,063 --> 00:49:13,463
Seems like they
had you doing a lot.

738
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,098
A lot of opportunity there.

739
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:17,368
You think?

740
00:49:17,403 --> 00:49:18,802
Two wars.

741
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,366
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:24,933
I gotta come right out
and ask you something.

743
00:49:24,977 --> 00:49:26,308
What?

744
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:30,274
Did you vote for George Bush?

745
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:31,806
No.

746
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:33,482
Good.

747
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:36,917
There's really only
one answer to that question.

748
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:41,084
Actually, I don't vote
for presidents.

The Commander in Chief
is the Commander in Chief.

750
00:49:44,496 --> 00:49:47,226
I find it's best not to
get invested in outcomes.

751
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:52,962
Is that answer still OK?

752
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:55,364
Yes.

753
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:05,376
You don't think Holly minded
when we ditched her?

754
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:06,816
No.

755
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:10,219
And it didn't seem too obvious
when we left together?

756
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:11,745
Who cares?

757
00:50:21,066 --> 00:50:24,263

Alex, what's going on?
Are you all right?

762
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:30,528
It's just my roommate.
Calm down.

00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:36,136
Come on, talk to me.

764
00:51:38,243 --> 00:51:40,336
Alex, come back to bed.

765
00:51:47,152 --> 00:51:48,915
- Sir.
- Shut the door.

766
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,618
When I said I had your back,

767
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:54,951
I thought we understood each other.

768
00:51:57,329 --> 00:52:00,492
That's why your promotion
was held up.

769
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:02,625
The fact that your father
retired with two stars

770
00:52:02,868 --> 00:52:04,495
probably kept anything
else from happening.

771
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:07,232
Sir, that person was
a very close friend of mine.

772

- Anybody can see that!
- No, just a friend.

00:52:36,535 --> 00:52:38,366
You got caught, Alex.

776
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:41,033
I was drunk.

777
00:52:41,974 --> 00:52:44,408
And that's what you're gonna
tell the board of inquiry?

00:52:45,077 --> 00:52:46,510
Yes.

779
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:52,243
OK...

780
00:52:52,284 --> 00:52:55,685
We'll say you were well hammered
and taken advantage of,

781
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:59,049
or some latent feelings
were unlocked by the booze,

782
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:01,025
but that you're straight.

783
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:03,289
A bit confused, but straight.

784
00:53:03,328 --> 00:53:05,626
Yes, exactly.

785
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:08,189
And those emails were
a prank of some kind.

Her fantasy, not mine.

Aside from my already
being married,

talking about here?

Is there any man on base who can
put this whole thing to rest?

Adultery is also illegal, sir.

some karate moves?

If someone's gonna
grab your shoulders,

833
00:57:50,482 --> 00:57:52,973
first thing is you smack
and grab here on the wrist...

834

Put your arm
on top of my arm.

835

Yeah, that's it.

836
00:58:03,361 --> 00:58:05,329
If you're choking,
the first thing is to

837
00:58:05,363 --> 00:58:07,422
turn your head
so you can breathe...

838
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:13,997

this seam and fold it over...

to settle down yet.

- Three.

One more than my body
tells me I can.

864
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:38,912

No arguments, birthday boy.

I was hopin' we could make up
and all be friends,

872
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:02,707
but no one's seen him.

873

for a replacement?

gettin' older around here?

- No.

Yes, she has.

880

something like this

886

OK, everybody, don't bunch up,

887
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:42,444
but always keep a teammate
within eyesight.

888

tuck your head down.

Hey, beanpole.

893

That came outta nowhere.

01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:00,769
Usually does.

895
01:01:02,574 --> 01:01:03,871
Get your hand up.

896
01:01:17,655 --> 01:01:19,122
That wasn't nice.

897
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:21,753
Happy birthday, Leo.

898
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:24,784
Hey, Stenny.

899
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:27,796
Fuck!

900
01:01:27,832 --> 01:01:30,130
Stenny!
I'm on your team!

901
01:01:30,168 --> 01:01:31,692
Oops!
[Whistle blows]

902
01:01:31,736 --> 01:01:32,794
You're outta there!

903
01:01:32,837 --> 01:01:34,702
- Sorry, OK?
- Fuck.

904
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:37,941
That was quick.

905
01:01:37,976 --> 01:01:39,170
Friendly fire.

906
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:41,935
Yellow...

907
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,971
Looks like alien blood.

908
01:01:44,015 --> 01:01:45,676
Better than the red stuff.

909
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:48,446
I don't know, you know...

910
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:52,081
I mean, workin' out,
makin' beds, gettin' yelled at -

911
01:01:52,123 --> 01:01:53,215
that's one thing.

912
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,619
But killin' people,
that's something else.

913
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:59,226
I can't even get
a spider out of the tub.

914
01:01:59,464 --> 01:02:02,490
The military is gonna
train you to do lots of things.

915
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:04,661
Non-killer stuff.

916
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:07,671
I think there's only a week of
rifle training in the Air Force.

917
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,935
Still...

918
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:13,535
I just don't think
I have it in me.

919
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:17,708
That impulse, or instinct,
or whatever it is.

920
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:24,019
Yeah, baby, eat paint!

921
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:30,694
The green team is drunk drivers.

922
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:37,527
The red team is your family...
Alive.

923
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:47,104
Damn!

924
01:02:48,012 --> 01:02:49,274
Bastard!

925
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:52,012
I'm out!

926
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,987
[Whistle blows]
New game!

927
01:02:58,022 --> 01:03:00,286
Stenny, you head up
the left flank.

928
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:02,652
Everyone, if you stick
in one spot too long

929
01:03:02,694 --> 01:03:04,286
you just broadcast
your position.

930
01:03:04,896 --> 01:03:07,126
Turk? Turk?!

931
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:09,065
Keep movin'... I got it.

932
01:03:12,137 --> 01:03:13,661
[Whistle blows]

933
01:03:15,673 --> 01:03:16,970
Let's go.

934
01:03:23,948 --> 01:03:26,178
Keep your head down
and check your colors before you shoot.

935
01:03:26,217 --> 01:03:28,208
Don't shoot your teammate.
Go, go!

936
01:03:59,217 --> 01:04:00,206
Yes.

937
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,240
That's my girl.

938
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,193
Saffron, keep moving!

939
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:11,855
Move up! I'll cover you!

940
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:32,707
Ow!!!

941
01:04:48,733 --> 01:04:49,757
Holly?

942
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:53,137
That's for your
next birthday, sunshine.

943
01:04:53,171 --> 01:04:56,698
Leo, you son of a bitch!

944
01:04:56,741 --> 01:04:58,641
Holly, we're on the same team!

945
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:01,407
[laughing]

946
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:02,704
Get him!

947
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,287
Try not to get paint everywhere!

948
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:12,152
It's more like colored
egg whites or something.

949
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:14,158
Try not to get eggs everywhere.

950
01:05:14,192 --> 01:05:16,786
Stenny, which one is red?

951
01:05:16,828 --> 01:05:18,762
He can't tell you that.

952
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:20,388
He's color blind,
ain't you, Stenny?

953
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:23,832
You shot me twice
in the back!

954
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:26,098
My aim just really sucks.

955
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:27,229
Here you go.

956
01:05:27,272 --> 01:05:29,832
Wait, hold on.
She's got a big day tomorrow.

957
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:32,900
I'm taking her down
to the recruiting station.

958
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:34,775
- Excuse me?
- It's time.

959
01:05:34,812 --> 01:05:36,040
You sure about that?

960
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,048
Yep, you're strong enough now.

961
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:40,778
Not quite as much of a punk
as she used to be either.

962
01:05:40,885 --> 01:05:42,750
I don't know about that.

963
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:44,755
Seriously, though...

964
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:46,757
After everything you've
been through,

965
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:50,227
after all you've survived,
that is saying a hell of a lot.

966
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:52,821
To Saffron...

967
01:05:52,864 --> 01:05:56,231
I think you've already made
a lot of people very proud.

968
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:58,326
(all)
To Saffron!

969
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:02,740
Hey, she's gotta
have a beer now!

970
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:05,936
Her eyeballs are sweating.

971
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:07,376
Awwww...

972
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:11,076
Girls are awesome.

973
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:13,845
I'm gonna drop her at home.
Save my chair for me.

974
01:06:13,885 --> 01:06:14,977
Gentlemen...

975
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:16,043
Attention!

976
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:18,113
Aw...

977
01:06:20,058 --> 01:06:21,389
At ease.

978
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:23,018
I'll go with you, hold on.

979
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,926
And leave Holly alone
with this wolf pack?

980
01:06:24,962 --> 01:06:26,088
Mmmm...

981
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:35,501
That girl was a train-wreck
three weeks ago.

982
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,264
Alex really shaped her up,
didn't she?

983
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,003
You shoulda married her, boss.

984
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:41,011
It should be clear
to all by now, Stenny,

985
01:06:41,045 --> 01:06:42,512
that I'm nowhere near worthy.

986
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:43,509
Screw that.

987
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:45,147
She never really
liked you anyway.

988
01:06:45,183 --> 01:06:46,844
- True.
- Thanks, Bill.

989
01:06:46,884 --> 01:06:48,943
Has anyone ever
met her husband?

990
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:53,023
Should i come in
and talk to your grandma?

991
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:55,925
No, she'll be way in
her cups by now.

992
01:06:56,828 --> 01:06:58,853
I'll pick you up around ten then?

993
01:06:58,896 --> 01:07:00,796
I think I'll march
up to your place.

994
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:02,800
It'll help take the edge off.

995
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:05,462
Just don't wear those clothes
and everything will be fine.

996
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,530
What if I'm not ready?

997
01:07:10,775 --> 01:07:12,902
They'll make you ready.
That's their job.

998
01:07:13,945 --> 01:07:15,435
What if I don't make it?

999
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,539
Well, as my mom used to say,

1000
01:07:17,782 --> 01:07:21,775
"Failure ain't the falling down,
it's the staying down."

1001
01:07:23,788 --> 01:07:26,518
She died when I
was around your age.

1002
01:07:27,825 --> 01:07:29,417
I don't know if you knew that.

1003
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:31,353
I did.

1004
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,388
Heard she was a real beauty.

1005
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:38,166
She was.

1006
01:07:41,539 --> 01:07:44,804
- Get some sleep.
- I'll try.

1007
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:10,197
What the hell is this?

1008
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:15,099
I was waitin' around
hoping you'd tell me.

1009
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:22,876
So...

1010
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:25,275
Tell me.

1011
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:28,079
Is all that true?

1012
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:31,511
What the fuck have you done?

1013
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:33,557
[laughter]

1014
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,492
Come on.

1015
01:08:37,528 --> 01:08:39,325
Flag's flyin'!

1016
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:40,921
We're home!

1017
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,559
Whoa!

1018
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,534
What's with all the carpeting?

1019
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:45,866
We'll take a tour tomorrow.

1020
01:08:45,903 --> 01:08:47,962
Come on, you can
sleep in Nicky's room.

1021
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:51,065
Nicky... How's he doing?

1022
01:08:51,108 --> 01:08:52,405
He's giving 'em hell.

1023
01:08:52,443 --> 01:08:55,003
I want to ask you abut Saffron.

1024
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:56,138
What?

1025
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,547
Why are you
sending her away to them,

1026
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:02,075
after what they did to you?

1027
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:03,950
When somebody falls,

1028
01:09:03,988 --> 01:09:06,013
somebody's gotta take their place.

1029
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:09,416
You didn't fall.

1030
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:13,454
I left them one short.

1031
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:15,523
Which one?

1032
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:17,534
[laughing]

1033
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:19,664
C'mon, take those clothes off.
They're filthy.

1034
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:21,396
I gotta pee.

1035
01:09:25,009 --> 01:09:28,604
OK, c'mon, it's this way.

1036
01:09:34,118 --> 01:09:36,245
Ahhh!!!

1037
01:09:38,256 --> 01:09:39,348
What is it!

1038
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:41,187
You got shot.

1039
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:44,160
Oh, I thought I had measles...

1040
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:45,423
You're OK.

1041
01:09:48,499 --> 01:09:50,330
Oooh, your neck...

1042
01:09:50,368 --> 01:09:51,995
Yeah, I know.

1043
01:09:52,036 --> 01:09:53,162
Let me see what you got.

1044
01:09:53,204 --> 01:09:56,105
Damn, you're a leopard!

1045
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,631
Stenny fragged you good.

1046
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:14,055
He kissed my hand
after you left.

1047
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:15,456
Leo?

1048
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:17,120
Yes.

1049
01:10:17,161 --> 01:10:18,992
And now I kiss you.

1050
01:10:21,966 --> 01:10:23,331
OK...

1051
01:10:23,367 --> 01:10:25,562
Now everybody's happy...

1052
01:10:29,507 --> 01:10:32,237
Everybody gets what they wanted.

1053
01:10:32,276 --> 01:10:34,141
That's nice.

1054
01:10:34,178 --> 01:10:36,578
- Come on.
- Where you going?

1055
01:10:36,614 --> 01:10:38,172
To bed.

1056
01:10:38,215 --> 01:10:39,739
Oh, no.

1057
01:10:39,984 --> 01:10:41,076
OK.

1058
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:45,583
Go to sleep.

1059
01:11:11,015 --> 01:11:12,414
She late?

1060
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,542
Yeah.

1061
01:11:15,286 --> 01:11:17,049
Why don't you go get her?

1062
01:11:17,688 --> 01:11:19,246
No.

1063
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:23,392
Horse to water kind of thing?

1064
01:11:23,427 --> 01:11:24,519
Basically.

1065
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:31,534
I think I drunk-dialed Leo
last night.

1066
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:33,594
Uh, oh.

1067
01:11:36,173 --> 01:11:38,539
And I offer a blanket mea culpa

1068
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:41,409
for any other stupidity
that may have transpired.

1069
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:43,140
You didn't break anything.

1070
01:11:44,415 --> 01:11:46,815
So, what's next for you?

1071
01:11:47,818 --> 01:11:50,719
I gotta get a job.

1072
01:11:50,755 --> 01:11:53,053
I was just short of my pension.

1073
01:11:54,258 --> 01:11:56,283
God, those idiots.

1074
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:59,693
I wish ignorance was painful.

1075
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,700
[Phone ringing]

1076
01:12:10,574 --> 01:12:12,166
Where are you?

1077
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:16,637
OK...

1078
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:20,173
Give me the address.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1079
01:12:22,086 --> 01:12:23,178
By the airport?

1080
01:12:44,108 --> 01:12:45,439
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

1081
01:12:52,616 --> 01:12:54,516
You wanna sit down?

1082
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,381
I, uh, pulled a few favors to
get a flight routed through here.

1083
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:03,188
They actually gave me leave.
Can you believe that?

1084
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:05,718
Just to come home
and file for divorce.

1085
01:13:05,763 --> 01:13:07,424
I could have done it.

1086
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:08,727
No...

1087
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:10,734
Something's up.

1088
01:13:10,768 --> 01:13:12,633
I need to play this right.

1089
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:16,231
Go back to the base,
raise a stink, file the papers.

1090
01:13:16,273 --> 01:13:18,741
Let everybody see...

1091
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:21,506
I'm gonna have to
put on a show,

1092
01:13:21,545 --> 01:13:23,410
say some crappy things about you.

1093
01:13:28,185 --> 01:13:29,379
I'm sorry.

1094
01:13:33,424 --> 01:13:36,393
So...
Tell me what happened.

1095
01:13:41,165 --> 01:13:42,792
They had pictures.

1096
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,295
They were taken four years ago.

1097
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:48,396
The pictures were
four years old?

1098
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:49,337
Yes.

1099
01:13:49,373 --> 01:13:52,865
And they finally just got around
to showing it to a review board?

1100
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:57,678
There were some
harmless emails, too,

1101
01:13:57,715 --> 01:13:59,740
recent ones -
None that I sent.

1102
01:13:59,784 --> 01:14:01,752
- Harmless?
- Yes.

1103
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:05,580
You must have
done somethin' else.

1104
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,386
Were you drinkin' again?

1105
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:09,590
No.

1106
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:12,562
Did you piss anybody off?
Hit on the wrong girl?

1107
01:14:12,596 --> 01:14:13,290
No.

1108
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,390
Maybe they were scrutinizing me
because they caught wind of you.

1109
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:30,407
I wasn't with anyone
the entire four years

1110
01:14:30,447 --> 01:14:32,540
since those photos were taken.

1111
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:35,983
I knew it was getting risky,

1112
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,780
so I transferred to a new base,
I severed all ties,

1113
01:14:38,823 --> 01:14:42,725
and I have been
immaculate, pristine, since.

1114
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,387
When you transferred,
did you sleep around

1115
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:46,259
with any of the guys
on the base?

1116
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:48,959
No. I thought marrying
you covered that.

1117
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:51,832
Come on, that's no fail safe.

1118
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:53,894
You know you've got to
feed the rumor mill.

1119
01:14:53,938 --> 01:14:55,997
What about Pollard?
He's not married.

1120
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,333
You could have broken
a sweat on his back.

1121
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:02,538
I did.

1122
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:08,617
It didn't matter.
He was just playing me.

1123
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,885
I'm sorry.

1124
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:20,463
It might not be worth it, Joe.

1125
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,892
It's got to be.

1126
01:15:37,281 --> 01:15:38,873
Call me when you
file the papers.

1127
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:39,905
I will.

1128
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:43,508
Be careful.

1129
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:16,679
Tequila, Shel.

1130
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:32,795
What?

1131
01:16:33,737 --> 01:16:36,467
I'd like to say it's
none of my business,

1132
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:39,442
except it was taped to
the door of my business.

1133
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:42,368
And I have no idea
who put it there.

1134
01:16:50,354 --> 01:16:52,015
I run a business
where judging people

1135
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:54,081
don't make a whole lot of sense.

1136
01:16:57,728 --> 01:16:58,717
And?

1137
01:17:00,597 --> 01:17:02,656
I don't think this is right.

1138
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,362
That girl is really screwed up
enough as it is.

1139
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:12,907
OK, Shelly,
thanks for everything.

1140
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:14,877
Say goodbye to the fellas for me.

1141
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,574
Calm down.
No one's runnin' you out of town.

1142
01:17:17,614 --> 01:17:19,582
- That should cover my tab.
- Hey!

1143
01:17:22,519 --> 01:17:24,783
Mind if we talk
in your office, Shel?

1144
01:17:25,856 --> 01:17:27,050
Go ahead.

1145
01:17:29,393 --> 01:17:31,156
Somebody papered
the town last night.

1146
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:33,727
I was able rip most
of them down, I think.

1147
01:17:33,764 --> 01:17:35,595
Got 'em in my truck.

1148
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:36,792
Oh, God...

1149
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:38,631
I know this is complete crap.

1150
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:40,569
I was here when this
picture was taken,

1151
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:42,162
and nothing was going on.

1152
01:17:42,406 --> 01:17:44,067
You can do anything
with photos these days,

1153
01:17:44,108 --> 01:17:45,700
manipulate 'em...

1154
01:17:45,743 --> 01:17:47,574
But who would bother?

1155
01:18:02,926 --> 01:18:05,656
This part is complete crap.

1156
01:18:05,696 --> 01:18:06,890
Of course.

1157
01:18:10,501 --> 01:18:12,093
This part is true.

1158
01:18:20,477 --> 01:18:22,502
Since when?

1159
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:24,514
Since long after.

1160
01:18:29,987 --> 01:18:31,682
Oh, man...

1161
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:35,688
That's funny.

1162
01:18:40,497 --> 01:18:41,987
Wish you'd told me.

1163
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:46,099
I couldn't.

1164
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:58,011
So the million dollar question,
of course, is...

1165
01:18:58,048 --> 01:18:59,811
did I ruin things for you?

1166
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:03,952
No!

1167
01:19:08,025 --> 01:19:10,118
Just a preference then?

1168
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:13,121
No.

1169
01:19:28,712 --> 01:19:31,112
All right, let's just
focus on who did this.

1170
01:19:31,615 --> 01:19:34,243
I have no idea...

1171
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:36,752
But I really need
to find Saffron.

1172

[Doorbell rings]

1173
01:19:57,574 --> 01:19:58,700
Mrs. Snow?

1174
01:20:01,912 --> 01:20:03,106
Saffron?

1175
01:20:04,081 --> 01:20:05,105
Saffron!

1176
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:21,326
[hard, driving music plays]

1177
01:20:25,102 --> 01:20:27,161
[Knock on door]

1178
01:20:27,204 --> 01:20:28,671
Put that shit out!

1179
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:32,604
- Who is it?
- Pizza.

1180
01:20:39,983 --> 01:20:41,678
I want to talk to Saffron.

1181
01:20:41,718 --> 01:20:43,015
Yeah, talk? That's it?

1182
01:20:45,122 --> 01:20:46,111
Saffron.

1183
01:20:46,156 --> 01:20:47,953
Go home! I'm fine!

1184
01:20:47,991 --> 01:20:49,288
She don't wanna talk no more.

1185
01:20:49,326 --> 01:20:51,226
Get her out here
or I'll call the Sheriff.

1186
01:20:51,261 --> 01:20:52,228
And say what?

1187
01:20:52,262 --> 01:20:54,230
Whatever I need to
to get him here.

1188
01:20:54,264 --> 01:20:56,198
Look, I just want five minutes.

1189
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,965
Saffron, get out here!

1190
01:21:02,005 --> 01:21:03,836
Tell her to go away!

1191
01:21:03,874 --> 01:21:05,034
I'm talkin' to her.

1192
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,115
OK, we're marching
out of here double time.

1193
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,251
Pull yourself together.

1194
01:21:24,161 --> 01:21:25,856
There's no point.

1195
01:21:25,896 --> 01:21:28,262
I went to the recruiter's office.

1196
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:29,856
They had the pictures.

1197
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:32,400
It's OK.
I can take care of it.

1198
01:21:32,636 --> 01:21:34,399
No, it's done!

1199
01:21:34,638 --> 01:21:35,798
I can fix it...

1200
01:21:35,839 --> 01:21:38,103
Listen, I'm not your
toy soldier anymore!

1201
01:21:40,244 --> 01:21:42,178
I'm not your girlfriend
and you're not my mother,

1202
01:21:42,212 --> 01:21:43,679
so just leave me alone.

1203
01:21:44,982 --> 01:21:46,745
I'm your friend.

1204
01:21:46,783 --> 01:21:48,876
And a soldier or sailor
you can be.

1205
01:21:50,854 --> 01:21:52,321
Well...

1206
01:21:52,356 --> 01:21:54,790
I'm a meth head now, so...

1207
01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:59,421
It's OK, come on.

1208
01:21:59,663 --> 01:22:03,155
Come on...
let's get out of here.

1209
01:22:05,068 --> 01:22:07,093
Hey! Where do you
think you're goin'?!

1210
01:22:09,406 --> 01:22:11,237
You got her high,
you son-of-a-bitch!

1211
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:12,799
Stop it!

1212
01:22:12,843 --> 01:22:14,902
You're gonna regret
those photos, I swear to God!

1213
01:22:14,945 --> 01:22:16,207
You're being an idiot!

1214
01:22:16,246 --> 01:22:18,009
Don't you get it?!

1215
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:20,846
They don't want me!

1216
01:22:20,884 --> 01:22:24,251
They're gonna take
a meth head instead of you?

1217
01:22:24,288 --> 01:22:25,755
They're gonna take

1218
01:22:25,789 --> 01:22:28,917
a worthless piece of shit
like me instead of you?

1219
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:29,926
Saffron...

1220
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,758
Don't you understand
I should be dead right now?

1221
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:39,332
I'm the last person who should have
walked out of that car alive?!

1222
01:22:50,747 --> 01:22:52,271
Dude, careful where you shoot that.

1223
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:56,343
You'll blow up the house.

1224
01:22:56,386 --> 01:22:57,978
Tie her hands.

1225
01:22:58,722 --> 01:23:00,189
Fuck this, man.
We're outta here.

1226
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:14,396
I got this.

1227
01:23:17,974 --> 01:23:18,963
OK?

1228
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:24,505
Bust into my house

1229
01:23:24,748 --> 01:23:28,115
and toss me
all around like that...

1230
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:30,449
Maybe I'll make
the citizens arrest this time.

1231
01:23:32,255 --> 01:23:35,224
Or maybe I just shoot you in self-defense.

1232
01:23:37,427 --> 01:23:39,190
On the other hand,

1233
01:23:39,229 --> 01:23:41,288
maybe you came here
lookin' for somethin' else.

1234
01:23:46,303 --> 01:23:49,272
You really screwed me
in the store that day,

1235
01:23:49,306 --> 01:23:51,137
you know that?

1236
01:23:51,174 --> 01:23:54,371
Could it be you came by
just to return the favor?

1237
01:23:56,179 --> 01:23:59,012
Maybe you need to
prove you're straight...

1238
01:23:59,049 --> 01:24:00,914
Like Saff just did.

1239
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:06,954
You don't need pictures...

1240
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:08,890
'cause I get it all on video.

1241
01:24:28,845 --> 01:24:31,313
OK, maybe it's self-defense then!

1242
01:24:31,348 --> 01:24:32,474
Burner! No!

1243
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:41,586
No!

1244
01:24:58,375 --> 01:25:00,070
Why'd you fuckin' do that?

1245
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:38,914
Give me your cell phone.

1246
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:41,110
Give me your cell phone!

1247
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:54,121
I need two ambulances
and fire response at 12 Stanton.

1248
01:25:54,164 --> 01:25:57,327
Female, 20 years old,
gunshot wound to the abdomen.

1249
01:25:57,367 --> 01:25:59,392
Send HazMat, too.
There's a meth lab here.

1250
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:06,099
It's not yellow.

1251
01:26:08,278 --> 01:26:10,143
Help is coming, help is coming.

1252
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,545
It's OK.

1253
01:26:20,156 --> 01:26:22,124
Anything we can do,
just tell me.

1254
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:26,023
I can offer you that lift home.

1255
01:26:27,197 --> 01:26:28,164
No, thanks.

1256
01:26:28,932 --> 01:26:31,457
Come by the station tomorrow,
if you're up to it.

1257
01:26:32,936 --> 01:26:33,698
OK.

1258
01:26:36,606 --> 01:26:39,006
It was good that you tried...

1259
01:26:39,042 --> 01:26:40,669
Some of these kids
are worth catching.

1260
01:26:42,312 --> 01:26:43,404
Yeah.

1261
01:27:07,571 --> 01:27:09,630
It's not your fault.

1262
01:27:09,673 --> 01:27:11,197
It's gonna be OK.

1263
01:27:15,979 --> 01:27:21,713
#

1264
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:14,129
Thought you were takin' the day off.

1265
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,263
They're a little short- handed.

1266
01:28:16,306 --> 01:28:18,137
What about the party?

1267
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,266
I'll be there.

1268
01:28:25,448 --> 01:28:26,813
How you doin'?

1269
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:30,315
Are you happy? Sad?

1270
01:28:30,353 --> 01:28:32,344
Are you pissed off?

1271
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:36,181
No, it's good.

1272
01:28:36,226 --> 01:28:38,285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1273
01:28:38,328 --> 01:28:40,193
It just came a little late.

1274
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:53,301
(Radio announcer)
Well, it's official, folks -

1275
01:28:53,343 --> 01:28:55,641
the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy is history

1276
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,113
as the President just
now signed into law

1277
01:28:58,148 --> 01:29:01,584
a bill allowing gays to serve
openly in the military.

1278
01:29:01,618 --> 01:29:03,245
A lot of mixed
reaction out there,

1279
01:29:03,286 --> 01:29:06,084
which we will illustrate
in song after this...

1280
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,287
- Freeze!
- Stop!

1281
01:29:50,133 --> 01:29:51,327
I got him!

1282
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:55,231
Get off me!

1283
01:29:55,271 --> 01:29:57,239
Anything in your pockets
gonna stick me?

1284
01:29:58,141 --> 01:29:59,904
- Hi, Dale.
- You're a cop?!

1285
01:30:00,143 --> 01:30:03,579
Yeah, if I can't fight the War on Terror,
there's always the War on Drugs!

1286
01:30:03,613 --> 01:30:06,707
I'm arresting you for
manufacturing crystal meth.

1287
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,615
Oh, and I'm also
giving you a citation

1288
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:10,414
for a cracked sideview mirror.

1289
01:30:11,221 --> 01:30:12,654
Nice pictures, by the way.

1290
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:52,524
Nice uniform.

1291
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:55,726
Same to you.

1292
01:30:57,734 --> 01:30:59,429
Sorry I was late.

1293
01:30:59,869 --> 01:31:02,702
I got a good story
to tell you about my morning.

1294
01:31:02,739 --> 01:31:05,936
- I got some stories for you, too.
- I'll bet you do.

1295
01:31:05,975 --> 01:31:08,307
(Dispatcher)
22- 11 to county.

1296
01:31:08,344 --> 01:31:10,505
All available units...

1297
01:31:10,547 --> 01:31:11,878
Duty calls.

1298
01:31:13,216 --> 01:31:15,309
I gotta march off
that train ride anyway.

1299
01:31:15,351 --> 01:31:17,319
Outstanding, Marine.

1300
01:31:17,353 --> 01:31:19,719
I'll see you at your
welcome home party tonight.

1301
01:31:19,756 --> 01:31:21,815
- Don't be late.
- M'am, yes, m'am.

1302
01:31:28,798 --> 01:31:30,459
[Siren blares]

1303
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:46,473
Mama, mama, can't you see...

1304
01:31:46,516 --> 01:31:49,485
What the corps has done to me...

1305
01:32:29,959 --> 01:32:34,919
1, 2, 3, 4,
United States Marine Corps!
