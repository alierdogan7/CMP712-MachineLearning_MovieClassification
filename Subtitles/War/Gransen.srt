00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:35,069
Five miles inland in Norway

5
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:17,569
Nearest abutments, a charge.

6
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:22,527
If you discovered that you must do it themselves.

7
00:02:02,027 --> 00:02:06,444
It's cold, it would be good
with something warm to drink.

8
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:10,860
I fetch water for coffee.

9
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:29,694

- What happened?
- It's barbed wire.

14
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:10,610
- What do you mean by barbed wire?
- I can not talk about.

15
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:14,152
- What have you done?
- You know I can not say it.

16
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,610
- You must go to the doctor.
- I do it this afternoon.

17
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:24,652
- I know you!
- You're right, the doctor should look at it.

18
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:30,693
Come to bed.

19
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:38,985
- Hello, my boy.
- Boy? Know you not.

20
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:47,902
Good morning, pusling. Hello. Do you sleep?

21
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,693
- You can already see it.
- No.

22
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:58,985
I will not marry the big belly on.
So I have to bury grandma simultaneously.

23
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,193
- Maybe we'll see you again.
- Yes, it was nice.

00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:56,235
Book Today mom and I church

00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,360
And so to book dinner at Björn sided.

26
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:06,735
To think that soon we can live together.
We're getting married.

27
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:10,943
- And you must be in uniform.
- No ...

28
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:15,860
- No, no uniforms, I beg you.
- Then look at your grandmother and not the abdomen.

29
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:20,485
She loves men in uniform,
she is completely crazy with them.

30
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:24,860
Where are you cute when you talk like that.

31
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,985
She is named after Signe Signe Hasso.

32
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:36,527
- His name Gunder.
- After Gunder Hägg?

33
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:39,485
He's just the world's fastest man.

34
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:44,860
- Have not you forgotten something?
- What?

35
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:48,401
Sven.

36
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,860
- Damn, where are my pants?
- Where you threw them.

37
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,068
- Do not forget the doctor!
- No.

38
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,443
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Pipes.

39
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,526
Thank you.

40
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:26,610
Should I be honest, it's not mine
rings, but when I saw you, it felt ...

41
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:34,110
- It's something with your smile, your mouth.
- Let me try.

00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:42,485
- What are you doing, may I ask?
- Arrest of lottens hand, Lieutenant.

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,068
- Anna, you can go back to the fair.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

45
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:04,401
She is lovely. What is that?
A mustache.

46
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,860
It's good to see you.

47
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:11,860
Take the gun and went with them.

48
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,735
We might as make it clear.
I give orders and you obey.

49
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:23,318
What a luck, I came
so I can keep an eye on you.

50
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:28,193
- Have you got pea soup?
- It's cold.

51
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:34,943
- Who have you borrowed it?
- A driver Birger Johnsson.

00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:43,485

- Five man.

53
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:49,526
- How close to the border is it?
- Five km. This is the last post before Norway.

54
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,485
Have you seen any Germans?

55
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:57,610
No, no, you have to dig snow
and bar the way, that's all.

56
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:01,860
- Tell it now ...
- No, I will not tell you anything.

57
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:06,318
Do you think you are protecting me by not
to say something?

58
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:11,693
- And you're getting married.
- Yes.

59
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:17,901
- With whom a woman or?
- Karin has been after me for long ...

60
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,401
You, I Need

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,860
I have two tickets for Jussi,
he keeps field concert in Karlstad.

62
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:31,943
Nope, you can forget about
You must be in the bunker.

63
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:38,818
Will I feel so boring
when you have a mustache?

64
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,485
The border with Norway

65
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:50,276
That's fine Johansson, fine.

66
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:57,776
- Add to the lead, sur ersatz coffee.
- It is you who makes bad coffee.

67
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:03,026
- How the hell would you do it?
- Wicksell, how did you become group chief?

68
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:06,735
- I'm from Gothenburg.
- It is no recommendation.

69
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:11,610
- Keep up with the complaining.
- We are doing not know otherwise.

70
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,484
Shut up, there's lieutenant.

71
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:26,693
- Hello.
- Hello, pipes.

72
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:29,818
- Where's the roadblock?
- We had no warrant.

73
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:33,026
Think, or I do another
the group manager.

74
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:36,026
- I create it now.
- It must wait.

75
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:39,693
First make sure the new soldier.
Instruct him.

76
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:45,776
So turn off the fire and gets men
underway, it looks like a scout camp.

77
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,526
Must be done, Lieutenant.

78
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:54,318
- Sven Sten Ström, Eskilstuna.
- Bergström, Karlskrona.

79
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:58,359

80
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:03,276
- Sten Ström.
- Are you related to the lieutenant?

81
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:08,526
- Yes, that's my brother.
- Welcome to the roadblock 83rd

82
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:13,818
Henrik Wicksell, group chief.
I heard the lieutenant, erect roadblock.

83
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:20,068
And every six months, turn off the fucking fire.
You come with me to the Hotel Nyskoga.

84
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:43,984
We live here then.
There are straw bags over there.

85
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:50,359
- Hotel Nyskoga.
- It's a good group, it will be good.

86
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:55,568
- Where are you from?
- In 10, Sörmland.

87
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:01,443
- What is it?
- Peace on earth.

00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,026
Fine cases.

89
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:19,484
6.5 mm.

90
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:25,776
- Should there be two?
- Yes, but the other is to repair.

91
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:31,693
- Your brother is indeed grim.
- Yes?

92
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:38,401
- But it is said he is righteous.
- Make it so?

93
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:44,693
I must look to the boobs out there.
Install yourself and came out.

94
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:50,984
- Can I fire a salvo?
- Yes, the term Halvar.

95
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,359
I'm flat and free as a bird.

96
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:14,359
Hello, majors have visited,
but take a seat for a moment, Sten Ström.

97
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:30,568
&lt;i&gt; Now you're fucking, I say! &lt;/ i&gt;

98
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:37,026
&lt;i&gt; I know there's a damn renderi &lt;/ i&gt;
&lt;i&gt; across the border into Norway during the night. &lt;/ i&gt;

99
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:41,026
&lt;i&gt; - I have complete control of my ...&lt;/ i&gt;
&lt;i&gt; - Shut up! &lt;/ i&gt;

100
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:45,442
&lt;i&gt; You must guard the border, period. &lt;/ i&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Is that understood? &lt;/ i&gt;

101
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,192
&lt;i&gt; Yes, Colonel. &lt;/ i&gt;

102
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:59,817
- Sten Ström, entered.
- Good morning, Major.

103
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,942
- Do you want?
- Is not it a bit early?

104
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:07,276
It's cold.

105
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:16,859
- Do we have a problem?
- Nothing that can not be done.

106
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,109
That was not the Colonel.

107
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:24,317
He has received information about
ski over the border -

108
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,901
- But he does not know that it is ours.

109
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:32,984
- It was a little renderi tonight.
- It could have gone to hell.

110
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:40,734
It did not. Now we can offer
Germans in a surprise.

111
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:47,859
Burial Berg bridge was the last. Now
I need it leave, we talked about.

112
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:52,026
I've got new information
from my Norwegian contact.

113
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:57,484
Between Elverum and Flisa find there
troop movements in place unprecedented extent.

114
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:02,109
You may find out
about von Schell planning an invasion.

115
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:07,442
- We agreed that it was about the bridges.
- I will shit on your privacy.

116
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:12,401
It is here that we have worked for.
Now it happens, and it must be completed.

117
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:16,942
- When do we leave?
- They are watching me now.

118
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,734
I can not go alone into Norway.

119
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,942
That is you have to, there is no other.

120
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:31,442
- So I want to Järvinen.
- Honestly, how naive can you be.

121
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:38,276
He's crazy, he stays where he is.
Also, you have a contact who is waiting.

122
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:42,359
- In Velta.
- It's deep.

123
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:47,942
Have I been wrong about you?
If you have not grasped the extent of it here?

124
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,109
This is bigger than you and me.

125
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:00,609
- How do I find my contact?
- He finds you. Run in the morning.

126
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:06,984
- If the movements suggest invasion?
- Then we blow up bridges.

127
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:10,276
So may God take care of the rest.

128
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:18,567
It's not true, it is
many examples of Krylbo ...

129
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:24,026
- Krylbo was an accident, it at all.
- It's a matter of time.

130
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:31,192
Who says they will take Sweden? Would
they do, they had done it long ago.

131
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:37,026
If you see a German soldier on the road
you shoot him?

132
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:40,859
No, I would go and talk to him.

133
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:47,484
- Is it a good idea to talk with the enemy?
- What a fucking enemy?

134
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:53,151
I do not think the Germans see us
as enemies. We is not doing what they say.

135
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,484
We have our orders, we are here
to protect its borders against them.

136
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:04,692
That is the problem, we aim in the
wrong direction. The danger comes from the east.

137
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:09,276
Shit, Hitler has taken Europe country
for land, he lacks only Sweden.

138
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:14,025
- What prevents him from taking us?
- You mean well, we should stop Hitler.

139
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:17,692
No, let's clear the snow
so he does not get the shoes.

140
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,692
The Russians bombed Pajala for two years
ago, Hitler made us something?

141
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,942
Now we enjoy ourselves.
Bergström, how many cards do you want?

142
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,859
- Sven?
- I do not know.

143
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:38,692
Is the choice between Stalin and Hitler,
I choose Hitler.

144
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,692
- So you're a Nazi?
- You do not hear after.

145
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,150
- It's wise to stick with winners.
- Winning team.

146
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,859
What do you think of jew issue?

147
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:05,067
I have nothing against Jews.

148
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:09,484
- But they always do something damn ...
- Stop There!

149
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:12,900
Stop it!

150
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:17,025
- No more talk about politics!
- You fucking idiot!

151
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:20,400
Now take a small one and sit down.

152
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:50,150
- Where are you going?
- I would go jogging.

153
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:58,109
- Want to go skiing now?
- I want to see the boundary.

154
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:09,067
We are full. Come, we go into
and sleep. We need shovels in the morning.

155
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:15,692
I can not sleep.
I will look at Bergstroem friends.

156
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:23,442
- There is nothing to see.
- Then I'll probably look at it.

157
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:08,359
We must go back. Sten Ström, come on.

158
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:12,400
Schss, it's right up there.

159
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:20,275
Sten Ström!

160
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:30,692
- It all looks the same.
- Quiet, come on.

161
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,275
Come, we go back
You must see it a second time.

162
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,567
- It's Germans. Did you see any limit?
- No.

163
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:32,733
They are looking for us.

164
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,317
There!

165
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:12,858
Help me!

166
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,483
Come on, every six months, come on.

167
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:32,150
So come, however!

168
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:50,692
Awake, awake!

169
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:57,317
Halvar.

170
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,483
Come on.

171
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:18,317
- What?
- Nothing, just slept on.

172
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,608
Come on, you do not get up yet.

173
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,442
I would leave a little earlier.

174
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:46,942
How romantic. You come and go,
when I sleep.

175
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,858
Sorry, but Adolfsson is constantly
after me.

176
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:56,358
I have a whole company,
which freeze your ass of in the bunker there.

177
00:25:56,567 --> 00:26:02,983
You know what? We got the church on Saturday.
Was not it good?

178
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:08,692
Did it so easily?

179
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:33,608
Come, stand here, close your eyes.

180
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:37,983
No. close your eyes, do not look.

181
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:07,150
See.

182
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:14,900
Where are they beautiful.

183
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:20,441
- I love you.
- And I love you.

184
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,150
- Karin, I ...
- No.

185
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:32,400
Sit.
Fall on your knees.

186
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:42,358
Karin ...

187
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:44,691
I ...

188
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:49,900
I can not marry you
on Saturday.

189
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:55,650
- Aaron, it's not funny.
- I can do nothing, that's an order.

190
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:04,275
- You're an officer, give a different order.
- I can not.

191
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:11,108
- You are injured, they may send another.
- I really try.

192
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:15,650
- I have done.
- You do what you want, it's fine.

193
00:28:15,858 --> 00:28:20,983
You're not listening, I can not
do anything, period.

194
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:26,150
And on Saturday I go to church
with or without you, period.

195
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:31,358
- Do not promise something you do not.
- What are you talking about? What have I promised?

196
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:36,108
- What did the doctor?
- Which doctor?

197
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:39,733
- What did he say?
- He made it.

198
00:28:39,941 --> 00:28:45,025
- Let me see. Show me.
- Stop Now.

199
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:48,733
Stop now.
Stop it!

200
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,358
Good morning. Lieutenant.

201
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,483
- Is Järvinen here?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

202
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:55,608
- Is this roadblock 83's KSP?
- Yes, now it can easily be printed by.

203
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:11,358
- You have done well here.
- Have you had a shit morning?

204
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:17,066
- How about a little ski trip?
- How could it happen?

205
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:21,274
I spy 25th Armored Division.

206
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:25,316
I need someone I can trust.

207
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:35,566
- When the shit for Adolfsson, you're here?
- No, and he must not know.

208
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:43,358
Fine, I need some fresh air.

209
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:52,274
I'll get the gear, and you stick
at rest, till I'm back.

210
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:24,358
What the hell are they doing?

211
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:56,899
Wicksell, up with you, then come.

212
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:03,774
- The absence of two men.
- They must have escaped while I slept.

213
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:08,858
Here lies schnapps bottles everywhere.
I have been drinking.

214
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:12,108
- How can you afford it?
- It was ...

215
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:16,233
- You are standing in shit.
- I thought it was good for ...

216
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:18,649
Ten so quiet!

217
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:25,691
When Ekström comes, you say, I took
Sten Ström and every six months with at skitræning.

218
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,108
- It's an order.
- In that case, I will.

219
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:35,691
- You are responsible for the roadblock.
- And for Sven and every six months.

220
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:40,066
He's right, Lieutenant.
Several pairs of eyes see more.

221
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:47,733
Go to Järvinen.
I put on skis for two minutes.

222
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:55,024
We continue to stand,
I keep you three yards behind us.

223
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,649
Satan, what have they done?

224
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:53,149
Sten Ström. Aaron, you hear for?

225
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:01,024
Aaron, it is he your brother?

226
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:06,940
Now you must take command, you hear?

227
00:39:07,149 --> 00:39:10,065
The two have gone from here now!

228
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,940
They have taken him.
They have taken Sven with him.

229
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:21,315
We must put behind them now.

230
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:43,232
Sven is gone.
Aaron and I follow the trail.

231
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,940
I take back every six months equal to
the roadblock.

232
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:59,232
Hear ye?

233
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,774
To hell then!

234
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:14,565
You are soldier.
You must see your dead buddy.

235
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:25,357
Wicksell.

236
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:28,982
Wicksell, help me now.

237
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,773
Aaron, Aaron!

238
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:14,565
- Truck Trail. We follow them.
- It is impossible.

239
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:18,648
- No, it is not.
- They have seven, eight hours ahead.

240
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:23,440
- We have no alternatives.
- Yes, we have.

241
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:30,565
We have one dead and two are scared
to death, them we must first make sure.

242
00:41:30,773 --> 00:41:34,315
- We lose him.
- We have already.

243
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:38,815
I have command,
and you do as I say.

244
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:53,315
Which direction should we go?

245
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:06,273
Come on, there are always ways to locate
people.

246
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:11,898
We find him, I promise you.

247
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:13,023
We need to get them away from there.

248
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:48,815
Bergström, Wicksell, climb above!
Climb over here!

249
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,398
Wicksell! Help.

250
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:09,148
Help now. Climb over here.

251
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:15,523
Climb over here, Bergström climb here.
Climb now!

252
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:18,731
Climb over here!

253
00:44:28,523 --> 00:44:32,440
Bergström! Climb over here, Bergström!

254
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:44,565
Järvinen, get them away from here.

255
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:48,856
Here, come with. Come on!

256
00:44:49,065 --> 00:44:53,148
- Come on!
- Follow Järvinen.

257
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:59,981
Come, come, come!

258
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:20,481
Coffee and eggs and anchovy sandwiches.
Here you go, Major.

259
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,606
Thank you, madam.

260
00:45:24,898 --> 00:45:30,773
- Excuse me, may I ask something?
- There you go.

261
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:34,981
I know who you are, but you know
not me. Karin Lindström.

262
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,356
- Yeah, so ...
- Aaron Sten Ström is my fiancé.

263
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:43,773
Well, however, take place.

264
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:55,606
It is such that major and I have
a common problem.

265
00:45:56,648 --> 00:46:02,273
My fiance has always busy,
so we can not manage to get married.

266
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:07,190
- Wedding, I must congratulate.
- Thank you.

267
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:13,106
- It's high time you could say.
- I understand.

268
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,856
- Can not replace Aaron a few days?
- Sorry.

269
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:29,065
Sweden is not at war,
everything can not stand or fall with Aaron.

270
00:46:29,273 --> 00:46:35,231
- In these times, we must all sacrifice something.
- I understand.

271
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:42,065
But he can not have just one day's leave?
It's not so much to ask.

272
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:53,606
I apologize.

273
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:05,940
- Sorry disturbance.
- It was so little.

274
00:47:06,148 --> 00:47:10,023
We offer coffee
and sandwiches today.

275
00:47:17,398 --> 00:47:19,314
Major, it is
roadblock on 83rd

276
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:31,439
Four miles to the northwest is a big lake
On the other hand, there is a mountain pasture.

277
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:37,773
- It is even deeper in Norway.
- Did you hear me? Go!

278
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:27,314
Come along, now!

279
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:33,564
Move! Go!

280
00:48:44,939 --> 00:48:47,273
The Lord is my shepherd ...

281
00:48:53,939 --> 00:49:01,148
Let me rest in green meadows. He directs
me to the water, where I find peace.

282
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:07,148
He refreshes my soul
and looking me in the right direction.

283
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:13,189
Do you think we get the death penalty for this?

284
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:19,648
What?

285
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:23,148
We come to a court-martial,
when we get home.

286
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:28,814
Court-martial?

287
00:49:32,064 --> 00:49:38,398
- What do you mean? We were just following orders.
- We shot against the Germans.

288
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:58,106
I know what you are experiencing.
One must simply suppress it.

289
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,564
- Try to get some sleep, Wicksell.
- I can not.

290
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:15,231
I think about every six months,
located there.

291
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:20,481
- We get him tomorrow.
- Then it becomes damn without me.

292
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:24,272
Then the mind never fail you.

293
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:31,731
When we met the Russians at Soususalami,
They had between 35 to 40,000 men.

294
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:36,022
They had tanks and artillery.

295
00:51:37,772 --> 00:51:41,772
We were 1800 men in the whole battalion.

296
00:51:44,147 --> 00:51:48,439
I had 132 men in my company.

297
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:53,606
Damn bad odds.

298
00:51:56,231 --> 00:52:01,814
When the Russians came, it was hell.
Mon ... they were everywhere.

299
00:52:02,814 --> 00:52:05,772
They were all over.

300
00:52:07,064 --> 00:52:12,564
It was pure butchery.
I lost 73 of my people.

301
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:16,439
More than half of one and the same day.

302
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:23,439
But we stopped them.

303
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:31,772
When the war was over,
I had only one thought.

304
00:52:33,689 --> 00:52:36,814
To get them home.

305
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:41,814
We found all but eleven.

306
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:48,981
We carried the frozen corpse
on horse-drawn carriage to Kaunusmäki.

307
00:52:49,189 --> 00:52:54,356
There we put them in the sauna
and thawed them out.

308
00:52:54,564 --> 00:53:00,397
We washed them in warm
water and gave them clothes.

309
00:53:02,772 --> 00:53:06,689
So we gave the boys back
to families.

310
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:16,106
But there is not a day where I do not
think of the eleven, we did not.

311
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:26,439
Helps you me find my brother?

312
00:53:28,189 --> 00:53:31,022
First we have the two homes.

313
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:37,522
The Germans will guard the border yet
stricter, now they know we're here.

314
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,231
Maybe it's a Swedish.

315
00:54:06,272 --> 00:54:11,730
What the hell are you doing?
Are you getting us into war?

316
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:17,272
- What happened?
- Your soldiers have fired on the Germans.

317
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:27,272
- Well, you ordered it?
- I have not ordered it.

318
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,772
However, we have had an episode
at roadblock 83rd

319
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,772
Sten Ström panicked.

320
00:54:39,564 --> 00:54:46,439
Do not lie, you end up in a court-martial
for this, get those fucking hands up!

321
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:53,855
- It makes you too.
- Enough is enough!

322
00:54:54,064 --> 00:54:58,064
I am taking over here and get cleaned up.

323
00:54:58,272 --> 00:55:01,730
Take your gear and join
Karlstad tomorrow.

324
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:08,314
This one incident has never occurred.
Understood?

325
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:11,980
I do not lie.

326
00:55:12,189 --> 00:55:18,314
- And the Colonel is good to correct everything up.
- It's too late for that.

327
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,147
We take his stuff.

328
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:48,064
We take a different route back.

329
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:55,605
I have the State Department on his back.
The Germans took one of them prisoner.

330
00:56:55,814 --> 00:57:02,105
- Who?
- I do not know. We have 48 hours.

331
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:06,855
So we have six soldiers
on the wrong side of the border.

332
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:10,980
If they are killed it is tragic.

333
00:57:11,855 --> 00:57:16,564
But if they survive and interrogated,
it ends up on your table.

334
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:22,897
What the hell have you been doing?

335
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:39,522
You said you had a plan.

336
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:21,522
- How many more than we do about this?
- Only three of us. Why?

337
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:28,688
It's going to cost.
Two lieutenant degrees.

338
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:32,688
The dry might not take you the job?

339
00:58:32,897 --> 00:58:37,522
- Do you know who it is?
- Yes, it was damn questions.

340
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:45,355
This man probably killed
over a hundred Russians in the Winter War.

341
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:51,688
He ran against their tanks and stack
birches into the tracks.

342
00:58:53,647 --> 00:58:57,272
Järvinen will never
follow voluntarily.

343
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:03,022
If we pick him, it is clear
I respectfully ask -

344
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,313
- The idiot who sent him
to Norway.

345
00:59:06,522 --> 00:59:12,480
- Can you solve the problem?
- Yes we can.

346
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:19,397
They went from 83 at roadblock
Norway and Black Bergen. Make it fast.

347
00:59:21,272 --> 00:59:25,272
And if they refuse to follow back?

348
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,022
Solve the problem.

349
00:59:33,188 --> 00:59:36,272
This time I get Finnish satan.

350
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:54,563
The fucking idiot.

351
01:00:39,938 --> 01:00:44,188
Come out!
Come out with your hands on your head!

352
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:48,813
- Come on!
- I am a friend.

353
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:59,063
- I am a friend. I'm Swedish.
- Go to the captain.

354
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:07,605
- I'm Swedish.
- Yes, you're Swedish.

355
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:13,938
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I got lost.

356
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:18,563
- Do not lie, tell the truth. Reply!
- Let him be.

357
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:25,271
He is our friend.
And friends help each other.

358
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:34,521
- I tell the truth.
- Well, I'm Captain Keller.

359
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:42,938
- Bergström.
- Is it your cottage, Bergström?

360
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:52,480
I know you're lying.

361
01:01:53,896 --> 01:01:57,146
Where are the others?

362
01:01:57,355 --> 01:02:02,438
Can you see ski there?
It is your friend.

363
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:09,855
You help the Resistance.

364
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:14,188
- Answer.
- I am a friend.

365
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:18,313
I am a Swede, I got lost.

366
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:46,438
Have you met your friend?
Him, I left by the tree?

367
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:52,230
He would not talk to me.

368
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:57,813
Where are your friends?
Where are they?

369
01:03:10,688 --> 01:03:13,313
Who is there?

370
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:17,355
There are tracks there to. Who?

371
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:27,688
- Should I shoot?
- They are taken away.

372
01:03:27,896 --> 01:03:32,021
They are looking for a plane.

373
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:34,688
Thank you.

374
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:58,938
Let me go.

375
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:03,188
Release me!

376
01:04:13,105 --> 01:04:16,938
Do you realize, we follow the ski tracks.

377
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:26,479
Wicksell.

378
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:29,188
Wicksell.

379
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:49,813
We must get away from here.

380
01:06:51,146 --> 01:06:55,646
Come on.
Here, come on Wicksell.

381
01:07:26,479 --> 01:07:29,479
I must rest a bit.

382
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:36,396
Operation Arctic Fox

383
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:51,729
This must to Sweden.
They will attack.

384
01:08:52,854 --> 01:08:56,771
Here is where the collection areas are.

385
01:09:00,187 --> 01:09:04,312
And where the depots are
here says it all.

386
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,104
Is there a date?

387
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:39,771
- Be patient, Larsson.
- It feels wrong.

388
01:09:42,354 --> 01:09:46,937
He will see me in the eye when he dies.

389
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,771
Wicksell.

390
01:10:15,896 --> 01:10:18,979
Sven is with them, Sven.

391
01:10:32,021 --> 01:10:35,271
Up in the cars!

392
01:11:04,312 --> 01:11:06,646
Damn! Damn!

393
01:11:09,104 --> 01:11:11,729
400772nd

394
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:23,979
- Do you think we are so close to Velta?
- Everything looks the same in the fucking snow.

395
01:11:24,896 --> 01:11:28,771
Wicksell, how are you?
Wicksell?

396
01:11:29,729 --> 01:11:33,396
- How are you?
- Things are going fine.

397
01:11:33,604 --> 01:11:37,437
- Are you down and keeps looking at the road?
- Yes.

398
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:53,895
- We might as well be here.
- I do not trust that shit compass.

399
01:11:54,104 --> 01:11:58,729
We have nothing else, we can rely on
but there are stone bridge.

400
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:25,104
It is not the right truck.

401
01:12:28,354 --> 01:12:32,812
This fits not know if ...

402
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,437
Wicksell.

403
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:43,687
- The idiot.
- What the hell is he doing?

404
01:12:47,687 --> 01:12:50,312
Sven, you have a Sven?

405
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,354
- Who is Sven? Lower the weapon.
- I do not understand German.

406
01:12:54,562 --> 01:12:59,437
Do you understand him? Are you Swedish?
I do not understand you, drop the gun.

407
01:12:59,645 --> 01:13:03,187
Do you know where Sven is?
I do not understand German.

408
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:06,395
Lower the weapon. Lower the weapon!

409
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:13,687
Retreat, Wicksell, running hither, run!

410
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:21,229
Run for hell!

411
01:13:43,562 --> 01:13:45,437
Wicksell!

412
01:13:45,645 --> 01:13:48,145
Hold!

413
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:06,395
Aaron!

414
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,395
Aaron! Help!

415
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:55,854
He is already dead.

416
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,895
Get the dogs.

417
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:45,478
Come on, there is not much time.
Hurry.

418
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:48,853
Aldofsson waiting by the road.
Come on.

419
01:17:54,145 --> 01:17:57,520
We can not reach ...

420
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,603
We must get away before the dogs come.

421
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,811
Bear to the wolf came.

422
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,770
Bear to the wolf came.

423
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,770
Bear to the wolf came.

424
01:19:52,395 --> 01:19:54,311
Järvinen!

425
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:57,395
Damn!

426
01:25:46,311 --> 01:25:49,269
You must have some water in you.

427
01:26:11,227 --> 01:26:14,352
We're safe here.

428
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:21,019
But we have not only Germans after us
it is also the Swedes.

429
01:26:26,436 --> 01:26:29,852
It was the Swedes
who tried to kill us.

430
01:26:32,852 --> 01:26:37,061
I know the pigs
who attacked me on the ice.

431
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:42,352
Hagman was in my Company
in the Winter War.

432
01:26:44,852 --> 01:26:48,644
I found him about to rape
a woman.

433
01:26:48,852 --> 01:26:53,436
It cost me an eye,
but it was worth it.

434
01:26:53,644 --> 01:26:56,394
And now we're even.

435
01:27:06,936 --> 01:27:09,269
- Aaron?
- Yes.

436
01:27:09,477 --> 01:27:12,644
Egil. Eat.

437
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:24,019
You took your time.

438
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:28,852
- The Germans?
- Yes.

439
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:31,769
And with the Swedes.

440
01:27:32,977 --> 01:27:36,977
There are many
that wants to get hold of you.

441
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:41,811
The Germans killed three of my soldiers.

442
01:27:43,936 --> 01:27:46,811
And they have my brother.

443
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:54,352
- Are you sure?
- We saw him on a truck.

444
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:57,894
There were at least two prisoners.

445
01:27:58,102 --> 01:28:01,269
- On the way north?
- Yes.

446
01:28:03,644 --> 01:28:08,352
It is not completely safe
but I think I know where they are.

447
01:28:12,311 --> 01:28:14,269
Where?

448
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:20,602
They use the old school in Lundemyra
as a barracks and interrogation room.

449
01:28:33,144 --> 01:28:36,227
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

450
01:28:54,519 --> 01:28:56,769
Hello.

451
01:29:07,311 --> 01:29:10,727
Well ... where are the others?

452
01:29:12,602 --> 01:29:17,185
- Where are your soldiers?
- They are dead.

453
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:21,435
Your task was to solve,
what troop movements meant.

454
01:29:21,644 --> 01:29:26,352
It was the Germans who were chasing us.
Why do you have the damn uniform on?

455
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,144
How else could I move myself?
Pak, are going home.

456
01:29:30,352 --> 01:29:35,019
- I'm not going anywhere without Sven.
- And how will you get him?

457
01:29:35,227 --> 01:29:38,769
Egil know where he is.

458
01:29:40,519 --> 01:29:44,560
- Pak ...
- You sent Hagman after us.

459
01:29:44,769 --> 01:29:47,102
Yes.

460
01:29:48,102 --> 01:29:51,727
- Were you ordered it?
- No.

461
01:30:04,894 --> 01:30:09,685
You shot some Germans.
Do you know what happens if they get you?

462
01:30:09,894 --> 01:30:13,269
You know too much about what I do.

463
01:30:13,477 --> 01:30:18,435
It is for Sweden. Others may decide
whether it is right or wrong.

464
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:27,185
I ask you to take home.
I know you must be a dad.

465
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:31,394
I must bring my brother home.

466
01:30:33,977 --> 01:30:39,685
It is important that this comes
to Sweden than we do.

467
01:30:46,644 --> 01:30:50,477
- Where are you from?
- From a German kurerfly.

468
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:03,852
It is their whole plan.

469
01:31:15,519 --> 01:31:19,435
Your task is complete. Thank you.

470
01:31:30,019 --> 01:31:32,769
Now we have a dram.

471
01:31:47,352 --> 01:31:49,394
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

472
01:31:51,644 --> 01:31:54,060
Kippis.

473
01:32:01,019 --> 01:32:04,060
How do we get to school?

474
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:08,102
- Are you sure you want there?
- I have to.

475
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:11,519
My son died in the schoolhouse.

476
01:32:13,519 --> 01:32:16,894
He was 18 years.

477
01:32:22,102 --> 01:32:25,810
I became a resistance fighter
the 9th April, 1940.

478
01:32:26,019 --> 01:32:31,269
In recent years I have worked alone.
You are more effective in a way.

479
01:32:31,477 --> 01:32:37,435
Then blew the Captain Keller on me.

480
01:32:37,643 --> 01:32:42,393
He was close to me several times.
He is not stupid. But it did not.

481
01:32:44,185 --> 01:32:48,602
So he threw himself into my family.

482
01:32:51,268 --> 01:32:58,060
They inquired Jon in the schoolhouse.
But he did not know where I was.

483
01:32:58,268 --> 01:33:01,768
If only he had known.
He did not know.

484
01:33:05,018 --> 01:33:11,102
Captain Keller threw his body
the yard at home.

485
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:16,560
So he knocked on the door.

486
01:33:16,768 --> 01:33:20,893
When my wife opened
he shot her in the head.

487
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:26,185
I found them.

488
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:32,310
They're here.

489
01:33:37,602 --> 01:33:41,227
They're here. They are below us.

490
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:47,185
How many Germans are there in the school house?

491
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,768
- 15-20 pieces.
- We need more weapons.

492
01:34:03,227 --> 01:34:06,143
We should be able to get by with it here.

493
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:12,852
First we get your brother out so that evens us
the damn house to the ground.

494
01:34:17,893 --> 01:34:21,727
Yes, it sucks
but it is effective against the cold.

495
01:34:21,935 --> 01:34:27,852
We get 35-40 minus degrees the next day,
do not forget the purse.

496
01:34:28,727 --> 01:34:32,143
- It will not do.
- Why not?

497
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:35,477
So much fat you do not.

498
01:35:05,518 --> 01:35:08,227
Bear to the wolf came.

499
01:35:09,893 --> 01:35:12,393
Bear to the wolf came.

500
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:18,727
Bear to the wolf came.

501
01:35:20,227 --> 01:35:22,435
Bear to the wolf came.

502
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,560
The wolf here, come.

503
01:35:34,227 --> 01:35:36,435
Aaron ...

504
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:42,560
I know you can hear me.

505
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,102
Say something I need to hear
your voice.

506
01:36:00,852 --> 01:36:03,810
I yearn for you.

507
01:36:18,976 --> 01:36:21,935
You need to come home.

508
01:36:23,685 --> 01:36:26,685
We need you.

509
01:36:37,601 --> 01:36:41,393
- I come as soon as I can.
- Aaron.

510
01:36:43,768 --> 01:36:46,476
You ...

511
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:56,185
I know you do not get home
until you have done what you need.

512
01:36:58,768 --> 01:37:01,685
But I'll just ...

513
01:37:26,518 --> 01:37:28,976
I love you.

514
01:37:42,518 --> 01:37:45,101
I love you.

515
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:56,726
Now we do it here.

516
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:58,768
Here is the school house.
Down the road is a guard post.

517
01:39:01,351 --> 01:39:06,851
In front of the entrance and on brick wall
the landscape is open, the rest is forest.

518
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:09,726
I'm sure
prisoners in the basement.

519
01:39:09,935 --> 01:39:14,226
There is a basement drop on the back.
We have cold weather on our side.

520
01:39:14,435 --> 01:39:21,310
If we get your brother out alive
puts you into the woods with him.

521
01:40:32,184 --> 01:40:35,268
Get in the car, quickly.

522
01:40:37,976 --> 01:40:40,851
It is your car.

523
01:46:18,101 --> 01:46:21,976
Come, come.

524
01:46:22,184 --> 01:46:24,892
Sven, it's me, it's me.

525
01:46:49,142 --> 01:46:52,100
Go, hurry.

526
01:49:17,059 --> 01:49:20,892
We must get away from here.

527
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,309
Do you hear, Aaron?
We must away!

528
01:49:24,517 --> 01:49:26,559
Aaron!

529
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:30,767
We must get away from here now.

530
01:49:30,975 --> 01:49:34,517
Egil Egil!

531
01:49:34,725 --> 01:49:37,600
Get out! Get away!

532
01:49:37,809 --> 01:49:41,184
- Egil!
- Do you hear, we must get away from here.

533
01:53:37,475 --> 01:53:40,391
Aaron, Aaron!

534
01:53:42,725 --> 01:53:45,808
Aaron, Aaron.

535
01:53:48,433 --> 01:53:54,016
Open your eyes, open them, I say.
We must get away from here.

536
01:53:55,183 --> 01:53:58,975
Then wake, however. We must away!

537
01:54:01,475 --> 01:54:04,766
Come on up, get up.

538
01:54:11,933 --> 01:54:14,558
- Run across the bridge.
- It will not do.

539
01:54:14,766 --> 01:54:19,808
It sits under the bridge.
It sits under the bridge abutment.

540
01:54:20,016 --> 01:54:23,933
It sits under the bridge abutment.

541
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:27,433
- You should aim for the detonator.
- It will not do.

542
01:54:27,641 --> 01:54:31,141
Yes, you can do it, you'll hear.

543
01:56:02,266 --> 01:56:04,641
Aaron.

544
01:56:11,475 --> 01:56:15,308
Awake now, Aaron!

545
01:56:15,516 --> 01:56:18,725
Aaron! Wake up now!

546
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:23,850
Talk to me.

547
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:28,891
Aaron, we are on the way home.

548
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:32,475
Now we come home.
