1
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,495
- Run!
- Leave it, Listvitsky, you'll just make things worse...

2
00:03:44,372 --> 00:03:47,568
SHOUTING IN FRENCH

3
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,943
- Go home...

4
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:31,472
- Allah is gracious, Anwar-effendi. Welcome to Vidin.

5
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,062
There's blood on your sleeve. Have you injured yourself?

6
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:41,945
- I had to kill a Russian prisoner. He had seen my face.
I can't take risks. The stakes are too high.

7
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:49,523
Destroy the plate now!
- Don't you worry. Right this moment. Everything will be done.

8
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:52,656
Bring the photoplate into my study.
I'll destroy it personally.

9
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:58,393
Please, come into the house, Anwar-effendi.
Everything had been prepared as you wished.

10
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:15,434
- E2-E4...
- Will you not take a look at the board again? E7-E5...

11
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:16,938
- G2-G3...

12
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:25,281
- You are sacrificing the pawn, Effendi. But the laws of
hospitality do not permit me to take advantage of your negligence.

13
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:30,587
- Yusuf-pasha, the game of chess is like the game of war. And no
laws are applicable to war... Make your move, the pawn is yours.

14
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:33,514
- Where are the sentries?

15
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:42,625
- Please meet Colonel Ismail-bey, the personal aide-de-camp
of Field-Marshal Osman-pasha...

16
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:48,844
- I'm not familiar with details of your mission,
but you are a legendary man.

17
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:52,089
- I think I'll take your pawn anyway...

18
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:59,055
- Well now... You must make this move, I'll make another...
You move here - it's the only option you have.

19
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:05,407
And that's it, Honorable Yusuf-pasha, your game is lost.
And all because of a tiny pawn.

20
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:12,779
It's called 'gambit' - sacrificing the unimportant
to gain initiative. I'll do same to Russians.

21
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,018
Tomorrow Osman-pasha will capture Pleven
and flank the Russian troops.

22
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:22,416
Russians will attack Pleven and will be stuck there
for a long time. The offensive will be stopped.

23
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:30,180
- Of course, when Anwar-effendi himself takes
matters in hands there's no need to worry.

24
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:37,310
However, Effendi, it's time to pray.
Please proceed to this room - it's windows face Mecca.

25
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,050
TURKISH GAMBIT

26
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,787
FANDORIN (thinking):
- July the 2nd?... Well, it's today...

27
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:03,653
Osman-pasha flanks the Russian army
and captures Pleven...

28
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:10,923
Russians will move towards Pleven and will be stuck there
for an indefinite time - the offensive will be stopped...

29
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:16,371
It's called 'gambit' - sacrificing the unimportant
to gain initiative...

30
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:22,167
It's no less than 160 km from Vidin to Pleven...

31
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:25,531
Damn... Time to hurry...

32
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:31,136
- I told you it's a girl in disguise...

33
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:40,958
- She's with me. Take this...

34
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:53,735
Mademoiselle, mademoiselle...
You should have waited for your fiancé back home.

35
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:57,999
It's no Mayne Reid novel. The place is swarming with bashi-bazouks.

36
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:02,004
- But how?.. I mean, who told you...

37
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:10,280
- No suntan - it's one.
I can see the hair from under your hat - it's t-two.

38
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:19,560
Why would a Russian lady want to try get secretly into the army?
Romantic considerations. That's t-three.

39
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,203
The man with mustache that accompanied you and then disappeared
- was he your g-guide?

40
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:28,288
- Yes.
- And you naturally left all your possessions with him?

41
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:33,741
- Yes.
- Pretty stupid. That's four.

42
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:43,502
- Who are you? Where are you from?
- Erast Petrovich Fandorin. A Serbian volunteer. I have escaped from Turks.

43
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:48,877
- Varya... Suvorova Varvara Andreyevna.
Nice to meet you.

44
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:53,318
- What am I to do with you
Varvara Andreyevna Suvorova?

45
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:06,360
We need one more means of transportation...

46
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:18,192
- I need a donkey.
- 10 lira... - I don't have any money...

47
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:32,354
- Where's the donkey?
- One more time! - Donkey!

48
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:38,620
- I said, one more time!

49
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:53,273
White ears, red saddle.

50
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:12,445
- White ears, red saddle. Alright...
- You won the beast, didn't you? What's in your pocket? A revolver, yes?

51
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:20,298
- Unfortunately, my pocket is empty.
- And what if you haven't scared him off - that one with a bad eye?

52
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:23,408
- I never gamble with a person who can't be scared...

53
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:29,786
- But you had no money. What did you gamble on?
- You.

54
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:35,656
- ME?! You... you are an dishonorable rascal!

55
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:40,392
- I never lose when I gamble.
That's why I don't gamble at all. No fun...

56
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:53,966
- Snob!.. Arrogant snob!..

57
00:13:55,802 --> 00:14:01,369
- You're comfortable? Use my robe.
- Don't you dare intruding my privacy!!!

58
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:08,874
If you think you are Don Quixote, I'm
no Sancha Panza. Give this mule to me!

59
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:12,894
Look at me, when a lady is talking to you!!!

60
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:21,755
- Get on the donkey.
- The hell I will!

61
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:26,148
- Get on!
- Over my dead body!

62
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,678
- Too late. They've spotted us.
- Who are they?

63
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:39,978
- Bashi-bazouks.

64
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,418
- Those who cut heads off?
RUN...

65
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:57,390
- Too late! Stay quiet... Let's pretend we are simple
peasants - no sport for them.

66
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:13,910
- What's going to happen? Are we in trouble? Will they kill us?
- They won't if you keep silent. Low down your head...

67
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:53,566
- Get on the donkey. Let's move.
- Have you seen it? Have you?

68
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:56,539
- Yes, I've seen, they have a Russian officer -
We'll tell this to the nearest patrol.

69
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,805
- I mean the head!
- Get on the donkey! Quiet!

70
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,460
- Ouch!!!
- QIET!!!

71
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:16,834
- Mother... Mother...

72
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:35,965
- Yes! A girl!!!
- Look, sir, a golden medallion. With rubies...

73
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:37,045
- Rubies?

74
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:45,255
- Get on. Quick, I beg you...

75
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:10,468
Come on. Come on. Come on...
Please, quicker. They are catching up on us.

76
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:48,017
- Shoot, shoot! What's wrong?
- The gun is unloaded.

77
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,269
- Sabres ready! Follow me!

78
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,401
- They've got our officer!

79
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:21,010
- Are you Chetniks? I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

80
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:28,418
My name is Seumas McLaughlin, I work for The Daily Post.

81
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:34,977
- We are Russian. My name's Erast Fandorin, and my
companion is M-mademoiselle Suvorova.

82
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:39,039
- A lady...
- I'm traveling to find my fiancé. He serves at the HQ.

83
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:48,737
- Have you watched my kill? Like a lightning, eh?..
- True.

84
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:56,595
- Who's the gentleman with a hat?
- Monsieur d'Hevrais, he works for La Revue Parisienne, a star among French reporters.

85
00:18:56,595 --> 00:19:04,313
The gentleman in white is Michel Soboleff  - a great warrior.
He's been dispatched to HQ. And is truly bored without action.

86
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:10,926
Charles and I are interested in everything.
This is our first day at the front.

87
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:18,714
- Got away, sons of whores! Nice horses they have!
Turkish fucks!

88
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:22,697
- General, there are ladies in presence...
- Where?

89
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:30,696
- Let me introduce Madame Suvorova. She is secretly
heading to her fiancé at the camp.

90
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,597
- Mademoiselle...

91
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:41,406
- I am Charles d'Hevrais, a reporter.
There's blood on your face.

92
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:42,851
Here. That's better.

93
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,868
- How's the Captain? Dead?
- Looks dead to me...

94
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:58,487
- Hold on. "Looks dead, looks dead"...
Moron...

95
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:05,856
Just a scratch... You are lucky, Captain.
Here, have a drink...

96
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:10,212
- Captain Perepelkin. Service of Supplies and Maintenance.
Your Excellency, at you service forever!

97
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:16,486
I thought we were deep within our own territory...
- You are stupid to ride alone. Get his wounds bandaged.

98
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:26,491
Halt! Tie him up. While he' still unconscious.

99
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,272
- Your Excellency...
- And who are you?

100
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:35,125
Romaev, get me some water...
- Titular Counselor Fandorin. I've escaped from t-the Turks.

101
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:41,691
I have information of utmost importance and s-secrecy.
- What kind of information?

102
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:49,452
- General, could we talk in private?..
- Nonsense. Speak.

103
00:20:57,106 --> 00:21:01,844
- It's vital you occupy Pleven.
Osman-pasha's corps is moving there.

104
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:09,288
- What is he doing in that rat hole?
- I can tell this only at the HQ, General. Time is s-slipping away...

105
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:15,021
- Everyone's alive?
- Your Excellency, looks like we found Semenov of the 2nd Cossack Company.

106
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:20,953
- Time to hurry, General.
- Wait a second. Take fifty men and get to Pleven. Take a look what's going on there.

107
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:27,518
- Yes, sir.
- Take this bird to the counter-intelligence department. Titular Counselor, my ass...

108
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:33,536
- General! What can fifty men do against an army corps?

109
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:43,648
- Doesn't look like Semenov to me? Semenov had a snubbed nose.
- See, the nose... the birthmark... the missing tooth...

110
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,854
- Hey, mademoiselle... Mademoiselle...

111
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:56,873
- Warrant Officer, have you passed my message on? Time's running out.
One more hour and it's too late!

112
00:21:57,711 --> 00:22:02,291
- Tell me, the man who called himself a "titular counselor"...
- Fandorin.

113
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:10,167
- Yes. Did he talk to bashi-bazouks in Turkish?
- Yes. He was a Turkish prisoner for 8 months...

114
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:14,666
- I don't give a damn what kind of lies he told you!
How did speak Turkish? Fluently?

115
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,595
- I can't remember! Perhaps not.
He stammers a lot.

116
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:28,423
- I'll cross-interview you both. Sit quiet.
Not a sound. Or you'll be sharing the basement with rats.

117
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:32,540
Officer on duty! Bring the prisoner in.

118
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:42,255
Lieutenant-Colonel Kazanzaki of the Gendarmes Corps.
Head of the Counter-Intelligence Unit.

119
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:46,987
Arrived yesterday.
Entered my duties immediately.

120
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:51,411
- WHERE IS HE?!
- Who, Your Excellency?

121
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:57,373
- The person calling himself a "titular counselor". Fandorin. Where is he?
- Everything is in my dispatch.

122
00:22:57,373 --> 00:23:01,461
- Good day, Lavrentiy Arkadyevich!
- Fandorin! Nice to see you, Erast Petrovich!

123
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:06,985
- Come on, son, open the hatch. MOVE!
- Have you sent troops to Pleven?

124
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:13,855
- Here's the order. I just wanted to make sure it was you.
- I beg you, for Christ's sake, hurry up!

125
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:19,484
- Encrypt immediately and send it to General Kruedener's HQ via the field telegraph. Move!
- Yes, sir.

126
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:28,788
- Rumors are you were killed in Serbia...
Let me give you a hug, my friend...

127
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,674
- Yablokov! Encrypt this. ASAP!

128
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:40,337
By the way, someone wants to see you...
- Who? - Your bride... Well... Doesn't matter... Execute orders!

129
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:51,038
Hurry up, Yablokov! What's taking you so long?..
- Cryptogram # 3456...

130
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,811
- Have you seen him?
- No.

131
00:23:52,811 --> 00:24:00,949
- Too bad... Too bad... The worst thing is that we lack
even his general description.

132
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:12,780
You know, Fandorin, I have a bad feeling.
This war has started out too smoothly.

133
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:19,414
- Yablokov!
- Luntz!

134
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:36,103
- Look, Yablokov... I have a message for you.
- Oh my God... Varenka...

135
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:43,215
- Bless you, Varvara Andreyevna.
- Who's there?

136
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:50,004
- Please meet Mademoiselle Suvorova. She came here
to find her fiancé. All dressed up and camouflaged.

137
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:54,206
- How do you do.
- How do you do... What fiancé?

138
00:24:54,842 --> 00:25:00,463
What have you heard, miss? She heard everything!
And it's totally classified!

139
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:04,805
I have to apologize, but due to
state security considerations

140
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:08,118
you have to spend the rest of the campaign
under home arrest.

141
00:25:08,118 --> 00:25:13,580
- But I haven't even seen Petya.
- What? You'll see Petya after the war is over. Officer!

142
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,439
- I think it's enough to ask Varvara Andreyevna
to give her word of honor.

143
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:20,666
- I swear, not a word to anyone!
- Under my responsibility.

144
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:24,439
- Erast Petrovich, we can't take risks.
Can we trust a girl?

145
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,320
You know: "Long hair, small brain".

146
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,964
- That was mean!
- Lavrentiy Arkadyevich, I need an aid, male or female. Doesn't matter.

147
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:53,520
- There's Pleven... Everything is silent and calm...

148
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:31,313
- Varya... Varenka... I knew you'd come!
- Jesus, you look awful!

149
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:36,577
"Marlborough has gone to the war..."
- And you look like Gavroche.

150
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:40,631
"A cruise around the globe is nothing
compared to the trip we take together."

151
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,694
"My love for you is adoration..
My home is wherever you are."

152
00:26:58,293 --> 00:27:06,071
Alright, I'll see tonight you at the reporters' club. It's fun.
- Petya, my love, I don't have...

153
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:13,510
- I knew you'd come!
- ...any money... Petya, where can I wash...wash up?

154
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:33,875
SPEAKING FRENCH

155
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:45,959
- Don't pay attention, it's alright... please come in...

156
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:50,518
- Romanian nobility is one of the oldest in Europe...

157
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:54,728
- Your Excellency, please let me
stay with you...

158
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:09,001
- D6, check.
- It's mate. - What did you expect?

159
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:14,344
- Your Excellency, you won't regret.
With my honor and life... I swear!

160
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:17,691
- Perepelkin, get lost. You're the HQ type.
Why would I need someone like you?

161
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:25,585
- Congratulations, Michel, with your new commanding post.
You're your own boss now.

162
00:28:30,748 --> 00:28:34,732
- Ladies and gentlemen...
This is my bride.

163
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:48,818
- Varvara Andreyevna...
Varvara Andreyevna.

164
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:55,730
- Put out the lamps - we don't need them anymore.
Sun has risen!

165
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:02,979
- Bishop moves to F4. What, you didn't expect?..

166
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:10,547
- Mademoiselle, let me introduce myself, Colonel Mikhai Lukan, Romanian Army.
- Varya. Oh...

167
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:13,178
Come on, I'm not the Pope
to have my hands kissed.

168
00:29:14,547 --> 00:29:20,057
- How do you do, General...
- Damn... It's... It's you?.. You!

169
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:30,654
- Monsieur d'Hevrais, didn't you recognize me?
- With difficulty, Madam. You looked terrific in boy's disguise as well.

170
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:35,607
But this dress...
- There's a professional dress-maker among the nurses...

171
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,518
- General, sir...
- Cut it... Gentlemen, me and Varvara...

172
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:41,794
- Andreyevna.
- I can remember her name without your help...

173
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:49,815
...are old acquaintances...
- May I invite you to the Romanian camp?.. It's much more fun over there.

174
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:54,940
- Mademoiselle, I'd be enchanted, if you'd call me
simply Charles.

175
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,320
- Just call me Michel.
- Your Excellency! You'll need your own HQ.

176
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:04,319
- It wasn't me who rescued you. The Cossacks did...
- Your Excellency, please...

177
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:10,247
- To hell with you! Hand me your written request.

178
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:16,647
Varvara Andreyevna, accept my apologies, last time I couldn't pay
you the required attention... In the heat of the battle, you know...

179
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,842
- So many stars...

180
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:30,428
- They say your sneeze can reach the skies from the northern
town of Murmansk. You can watch the heavenly lights there.

181
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:36,380
They are called 'aurora borealis'. And we're just killing time here.
Who'd want this rat hole?

182
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:48,661
-You are surrounded. Hand in your weapons.

183
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:52,354
- Alarm, brothers!!!
- Alarm! To arms...

184
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:22,399
- Breaking news, gentlemen, General Kruedener took Nikopol.
- Nikopol?.. Why Nikopol?..

185
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,826
You wanted to say P-pleven?
- No. Nikopol. I'll be the first to use the telegraph...

186
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:36,128
- Semyon, the map...

187
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:41,684
- Send the dispatch to the Romanian HQ a.s.a.p....
- It's a long way from Nikopol to Pleven...

188
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:48,955
- What are doing? Are you crazy?.. Get you hands off him!
Erast Petrovich, what's happening?

189
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:54,850
- Why are doing this?
- The cryptogram written by Mr. Yablokov had one word changed:

190
00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:00,861
Nikopol instead of Pleven. That's why
General Kruedener moved into Nikopol,

191
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:04,401
while Osman-pasha's avant-guard troops
took unprotected Pleven.

192
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:07,098
- Osman took Pleven?
- Correct!

193
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:32,718
- I swear, my typing was correct. I honestly can't understand
how a 6-digit 'Pleven' could have turned into a 7-digit 'Nikopol'.

194
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:41,776
It's a mystery...
- Leave mysteries to girl scouts.

195
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:49,093
Where did you study cryptography?..
- Listen, Yablokov, did you ever leave the cryptography tent?

196
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:05,489
- No.
- Petya, did you go anywhere outside?

197
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:09,715
- No. It's strictly forbidden.

198
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:25,196
- Where did you study cryptography?!!

199
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:54,103
- Oh, Mr. Titular Counselor! Thanks to you my fifty men...
I'm heading for the HQ! If they don't let me... I'll go alone.

200
00:33:55,973 --> 00:34:00,462
- Trouble again...
- Erast Petrovich!.. Where have you been?

201
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:05,840
Have you heard about Petya ... We must hurry, we must find
and capture that Anwar. Let's go!

202
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,274
- Excuse me, Varvara Andreyevna,
but I need time to think.

203
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:18,902
- Think? While you are racking your brains... Go to hell!..
I'll think of something myself. Petya, my love, I'll save you...

204
00:34:21,263 --> 00:34:27,375
- May I take a look at cryptogram #3456-s?
- Impossible. Destroyed according to regulations.

205
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:31,500
- Does the register say who brought it?
- Of course...

206
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:38,264
Here. Volunteer Luntz.

207
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:01,609
- Luntz!
- Yes!

208
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:07,544
- What's this? Dark glasses?
You look like a monkey! Take them off!

209
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:14,566
- Sir, my eyes are very weak. They are affected
by sunlight and dust... The medic said it's okay.

210
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:19,742
- You're in the army, not at a spa, Mr. Volunteer.
Tidy up!

211
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,447
- Yes, sir...

212
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:38,966
- Look, what if we sneak into Pleven
and take a look at the Turks, eh?

213
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:43,229
You are from a neutral country
and protected by the Geneva Convention.

214
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:46,347
And me? I'll go with you as your companion!

215
00:35:46,347 --> 00:35:53,654
Pleven? A splendid idea!
A reporter working both sides of the front...

216
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:59,097
But... How will we sneak around the Russian patrols?
- We'll work something out!

217
00:35:59,097 --> 00:36:04,347
- But it's dangerous. They can easily shoot us.
- Are you scared?

218
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:07,206
- Have you heard?
- About what?

219
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:13,160
- You haven't! General and I are going to Plevna
on a reconnaissance mission.

220
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:19,065
What's that?

221
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:29,480
What kind of devil's teapot is this? The entire battery is at its position already!
- My receiver was fowled up...

222
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,905
- What receiver? Don't bullshit me...
- Varya?

223
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:38,639
- Hello, Mitenka!
- You? Glad to see you, Varvara Andreyevna!

224
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:46,069
- Please meet Charles. This is Mitenka Gridnev, a friend of mine. He is an engineer.
- I knew I'd see you here!

225
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:49,458
- Is this you famous monster-mobile?
- Yes, that's her...

226
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:20,442
- I'm trembling all over...
How can you be so cruel? Eh?

227
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:30,686
- Have you brought the money?
- Of course...

228
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:34,976
Look, let's talk about money later, alright?
- What do you mean 'later'?

229
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:38,553
- Please, I beg you, let's talk about money after!
- No way. No more 'after'!

230
00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:39,554
- Damn!!!
- What?

231
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:47,972
- I beg you, don't ruin my life! It's my goddamn weakness...
- Damn you, Luntz, and your weakness...

232
00:37:47,972 --> 00:37:55,380
I've wasted so much time! Army is not a whorehouse!
- What a shame! I'll be court-martialled...

233
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:02,177
- I'm not interested in your intimate life, Mr. Conspirator.
Do you remember cryptogram #3456-s?

234
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:04,416
- No!
- Sent at 3 o'clock!

235
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,632
- Yes, I do recall, it said 'extremely urgent'...
- Who brought it?

236
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:12,151
- Yablokov...
- Did you take it directly to the telegraph station? Did you go elsewhere?

237
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,894
- No. I brought it there and handed it over...
What's wrong, anyway?

238
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:17,733
- Did Yablokov ever leave his station?
- I don't know.

239
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:22,563
Oh, yes... he did leave ... there was message for him...
I gave it to him...

240
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:25,253
- Luntz, who gave you this message?

241
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:56,533
- Who brought the message?! The name! Give me the name!
- I don't know him...

242
00:38:56,533 --> 00:39:01,238
- Have you seen him before?
Where?

243
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,239
- In the club...
- In the club? Reporters' club?

244
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:46,548
- I can't believe my eyes! Not a single patrol! I heard Asians are
irresponsible, but that's too much! Alright, shall we ride into Pleven?

245
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:15,241
Are you scared?
- Not a bit...

246
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:30,829
- My lady, what a splendid idea to come
and visit me. But aren't men's battles tiresome?

247
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:38,609
- Dear Ismail-bey, you can't imagine how boring it is at the Russian camp.
- I doubt that.

248
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:43,401
By the way, is 'Prokop' - my favorite cafe -
still there?

249
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:49,317
- Intact... But how can you be so sure
that war is going to end soon?

250
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:54,649
- I'm surprised Russians haven't
thrown me out of Pleven yet.

251
00:40:54,649 --> 00:41:00,961
- I thought Osman-pasha's corps is here.
- Can you see it?

252
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:12,207
No, no. Osman-pasha's troops will arrive only tonight .
My force here is a single company of volunteers...

253
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:21,330
The war could have been a real holiday
with such beautiful women around...

254
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:39,509
- Mr. Smart Guy! 'A t-t-trap'!
Let's hope Anwar is fooled!.. You're as blind as a bat!!!

255
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:45,985
He followed you through the camp,
then across the hills... And you haven't spotted the tail!

256
00:41:45,985 --> 00:41:50,678
- I think he was t-tailing Luntz, not me...
- What's wrong with you, Erast Petrovich? Foolish mistakes!

257
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:55,644
Anwar wins again and again!
- He's very cautious and extremely smart.

258
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,023
This time he'll surely kill you!

259
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:04,839
May be this is your plan?
That's why you joined the army?

260
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:10,654
You've found yourself a new bride -
in place of the one they killed ...The Death herself?...

261
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:14,412
- Lavrentiy Arkadyevich, how could you...
- Shut up!!! I need you alive...

262
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:27,107
Such tokens can easily
get you killed... Excuse me.

263
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:31,684
- Your Excellency!
- It's his plan - so report to him...

264
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:39,695
- There are shooters hidden underground
in a secret place. Care to see?

265
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:45,462
- Can we count on them?
- All are experienced warriors.

266
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,424
- Sir!
- Quiet, lads...

267
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:56,944
Quiet! I'll be here at midnight.
Don't sleep and don't smoke...

268
00:42:56,944 --> 00:43:03,833
- 'A secret weapon', Sergey Konstantinovich,
might be a good bait, I think.

269
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:19,807
- This is a war between two sloths. That's what you should write.
- Your volunteers look very courageous...

270
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:24,509
- Oh, no... These are Anwar-effendi's bodyguards...

271
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:31,430
- Who?
- A V.I.P. from Istanbul.

272
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:41,629
A strange bird...
Coming and disappearing all the time...

273
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:47,374
- Thanks for coffee and baklava.
I must be going.

274
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:58,260
- It's very dangerous! The Russian camp is over there...

275
00:44:03,383 --> 00:44:13,678
- Monsieur Effendi... Monsieur Effendi, wait...
I said wait!

276
00:44:22,588 --> 00:44:28,790
Shoot, you're the marksman!!!
- I won't!.. He's too far anyway...

277
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:36,341
- Got him!!! Surrender, you rascal!!!

278
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:48,592
Get up! Get up, I say!

279
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:56,693
Alright! Charles, shoot him!

280
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:00,104
- Why would I? He's done nothing wrong.
- He's an enemy!

281
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:04,778
Give me your gun...
- No!

282
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:11,057
- Don't shoot! They've got Anwar-effendi!

283
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:25,687
- Run!.. Run!.. Run!..

284
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:51,012
- Flank them!
- To arms! Follow me!!!

285
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:00,722
- Give me your hand. Get on, quick...

286
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:13,154
You've compromised my reconnaissance mission
completely, Varvara Andreyevna...

287
00:46:49,547 --> 00:46:51,536
- Everything will be perfect...

288
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:56,048
- ...Screw your steam pot!
- You can't stand in the way of technical progress!

289
00:46:56,048 --> 00:46:58,686
- I've seen your Anwar!
- Seen him?

290
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:02,037
- We almost captured the bastard...
- Where did you see him?

291
00:47:02,037 --> 00:47:08,258
- In Pleven. We shot his shoulder and tonight
we'll capture him. Won't me, Michel?

292
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,492
- Varenka, you are the Russian Joan of Arc...

293
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:19,933
- Dear Charles, a reporter MUST NEVER act like a spy!

294
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:26,320
- We'll catch Anwar and Petya will be released...
- Could you give more... details?

295
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,826
- You can read it in tomorrow's news.
Gosh, you're turning back into a monkey...

296
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:38,474
- Well, unlike me you look s-s-splendid...

297
00:47:38,474 --> 00:47:49,485
- Hooray to Varvara Andreyevna Suvorova!
- Hooray!!! Hooray!!! Hooray!!!

298
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:52,695
(VARYA SINGS)

299
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:17,624
FANDORIN THINKING:
Luntz... Luntz said he'd seen him at reporters' club...

300
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:33,397
At the club - one. In the field - two.
What could he hear about Pleven?

301
00:48:33,397 --> 00:48:35,573
D'Hevrais...

302
00:48:41,997 --> 00:48:46,562
'It's vital you take Pleven.
Osman-pasha's corps is moving there...'

303
00:48:46,562 --> 00:48:49,123
D'Hevrais heard it. Yes, he could.

304
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:03,213
The Spanish artist?

305
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:07,796
The Italian reporter?

306
00:49:25,886 --> 00:49:30,842
No, impossible. Simply impossible.

307
00:49:50,016 --> 00:49:52,222
- Varvara Andreyevna, I'm enchanted.

308
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:05,958
- What a jolly good company! Captain Count Zurov.
- Ippolit, how come!?

309
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:15,635
- Damn me!
I heard Turks boiled you alive!

310
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:20,807
You look awful, my friend, hard to recognize...
What's this?

311
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:27,162
Do you color your hair to look more dashing?
Well, we two have been through a lot, haven't we?...

312
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:31,279
My adventures are a separate story, strictly tête-à-tête.
Not for women's ears.

313
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:39,290
Well, you can guess the ending - lonely, no money
and heart-broken.

314
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:46,587
Gentlemen, how about a game of faro?
Crawl out of your corners and forget the chess...

315
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:52,444
Really, it's unpatriotic... Erast, you stay out of the game
- the devil himself watches over you...

316
00:50:52,444 --> 00:51:00,054
- Alright, let's play awhile... Colonel Lukan...
To promote army camaraderie.

317
00:51:00,054 --> 00:51:05,737
- Exactly... for camaraderie...
Low bets. 100 rubles for starters.

318
00:51:05,737 --> 00:51:10,760
Well... Anybody else, gentlemen?..
Are you in?

319
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:20,733
- The press club has just turned into a gambling den...

320
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,670
FANDORIN THINKING: McLaughlin? What was McLaughlin
doing when I was telling Soboleff about Pleven?

321
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:41,070
McLaughlin heard what I said. Yes, he could.

322
00:51:55,765 --> 00:52:01,371
- L-lavrentiy Arkadyevich? You're here?
- You were right - we got the bastard!

323
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:09,383
You know, I always get itchy before a fight.

324
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:18,035
He's been sniffing around for at least two hours. Take this.
He's not alone.

325
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:48,576
-There they are! Two of them!
- Hold on... There could be more...

326
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:52,817
- Colonel, no offence!
- Cheater!!!

327
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:19,014
- Such a beauty, mademoiselle... Nature...
By the way, would you like a bet?

328
00:53:19,014 --> 00:53:24,889
If I guess who's the first to leave the tent

329
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:32,991
you kiss me. If I'm wrong -
I'll shave my head clean as a bashi-bazouk.

330
00:53:32,991 --> 00:53:39,209
Hussar's word of honor! Come on! It's no risk for you.
There are about 30 men inside.

331
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:42,051
Well?!
- So who is it going to be?

332
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:57,965
- Who? Colonel Sablin. No. McLaughlin.
No. Semyon the waiter - that's who!

333
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:08,705
It's a miracle!
- I hope it doesn't rain...

334
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:11,588
- It's a miracle! God's sign!

335
00:54:14,277 --> 00:54:19,851
- You deserve a slap in the face.
I can see myself now - you're a cheater.

336
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:22,636
- Why? Mademoiselle, I'm as innocent as the Moon!

337
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:25,461
- Oh, what's up there?
- Where?

338
00:54:25,886 --> 00:54:37,267
- It's a hot air balloon to coordinate artillery fire.
- A balloon... My God, it's so simple: use a spyglass and you can see everything...

339
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:39,737
- I could tell you so much about artillery fire...

340
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:13,041
- Where are the sentinels?

341
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:56,890
- Stay put! Or the girl's dead...
- An ass!? It's a trap!!!

342
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:59,564
- Don't move! Where are you going!

343
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,731
- Erast Petrovich...

344
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:25,097
- Quick!
- What's going on?

345
00:56:25,097 --> 00:56:28,198
- Jump into the basket. Quick!

346
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:50,104
- Erast Petrovich, hurry...

347
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,361
Why aren't they shooting?
- They don't want any attention...

348
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:15,184
- Let's draw their attention.
- We can't. We have to get higher.

349
00:57:15,184 --> 00:57:22,847
- Oh! Binoculars. 18-power?
- What? Yes...

350
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:29,489
- We can spot Anwar himself,
not just Turkish guns.

351
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:36,511
- My God, what's going on?

352
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:42,962
- Turks?
- Not yet.

353
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:48,388
- Don't shoot! Fandorin is up there! Alarm the troops,
quick, and follow the balloon. Move!

354
00:57:54,401 --> 00:58:02,869
- There come the Turks.
- Turks? Then we can spot their positions.

355
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:07,354
- May I...
- There's an unfinished redoubt to the east...

356
00:58:07,354 --> 00:58:11,126
- Varya...
- Nothing between the hills... Alright, there are the pickets!

357
00:58:11,126 --> 00:58:14,981
- Varvara Andreyevna, it's too dangerous after all.
- Alright, one for me and one for you...

358
00:58:21,136 --> 00:58:26,806
Varya?.. That was pretty unexpected...

359
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,601
Holy Mother!.. God, save us!..

360
00:58:59,108 --> 00:59:07,489
Mitenka!!! Mitya, dear, help us!
We are drifting toward the Turks!

361
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,444
- Petrukha! Follow me!

362
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:18,744
- Varvara Andreyevna, hold fast!
Crawl over me!

363
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:35,216
- Petrukha! Full speed!

364
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:42,620
- God, where's he going?

365
00:59:46,364 --> 00:59:50,197
Don't you dare touch me so unceremoniously!!

366
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:59,228
- Varvara Andreyevna, hold on...

367
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:16,195
- Petruhka! Back up, full speed!

368
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:31,554
- Mother! God, I'm scared!
- Hold on, Varvara Andreyevna!

369
01:00:31,554 --> 01:00:41,177
- Oh, God! Erast Petrovich! Oh!
Don't look at me! Please, don't look up!

370
01:00:54,708 --> 01:01:01,371
- ...two batteries are here. An unfinished redoubt - here,
at the eastern flank...

371
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:06,146
And there's nothing in between
these two hills.

372
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:13,606
A long narrow gorge leading directly into the town.
As far as the suburbs.

373
01:01:13,606 --> 01:01:25,832
- It's the key to Pleven!
Absolute secrecy... is paramount...

374
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:31,447
I'll request medals both for you and Miss Suvorova.

375
01:01:31,447 --> 01:01:37,740
- You'd better release her fiancé.
You know that Yablokov is not a traitor.

376
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:46,880
- Yes, I do... But criminal negligence is no better
than treason.

377
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:53,170
- Lavrentiy Arkadyevich, this information was acquired
through Miss Suvorova's efforts...

378
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:59,477
While we sit here and enjoy our tea,
Miss Suvorova is on a mission right now...
