1
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,170
Let's keep those hammers working!

2
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,150
Rambo!

3
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,945
Let's go.

4
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:32,303
How are you, Johnny?

5
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:34,305
Good.

6
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,016
That's all.

7
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:45,483
I'm sorry they sent you to such
a hellhole. - I've seen worse.

8
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,819
Yeah, you have, haven't you...

9
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:53,490
I told you that I'd help you
when I could. Are you interested?

10
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,291
You can't possibly want
to stay here for another five years.

11
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:12,594
In here at least I know where I stand.
- Just hear me out first.

12
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:16,722
A covert operation
is being geared up in the Far East.

13
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:21,853
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.

14
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:26,566
Mission?
- A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.

15
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,531
Why now? Why me?

16
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,243
The prison camp you escaped from in '71
is the target area.

17
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:43,165
No one knows that terrain better
than you. The risk factor's very high.

18
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:47,128
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the
forces, and if the mission's successful,

19
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:50,256
there may be a presidential pardon.

20
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,968
You interested?

21
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,893
Yeah.

22
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:06,397
Good. I'll get the necessary clearance.

23
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:11,569
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.

24
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:13,153
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,490
All clear?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,659
I want you to know I did
what I could to keep you out of here.

27
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,787
I know.

28
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,877
Do we get to win this time?

29
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:30,504
This time it's up to you.

30
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,057
That'll be all.

31
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:53,021
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

32
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:58,026
You're the chosen one, ha?

33
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,822
You made
a helluva rep for yourself in 'nam.

34
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:04,783
I'm glad to be working with you.

35
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:09,913
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint.

36
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,335
He's here.

37
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,340
Morning, John.

38
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,969
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.

39
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,138
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo,

40
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,516
been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems? - No.

41
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:33,061
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.

42
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,981
Come on in,
let's get down to business.

43
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:41,111
I was glancing over your files.

44
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:44,406
Makes pretty interesting reading.

45
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:54,834
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.

46
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:58,879
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64,

47
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:02,215
accepted special forces,
specialization: Light weapons.

48
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,218
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

49
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:10,265
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

50
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,100
Medal of Honor.

51
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:18,983
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware

52
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:22,903
that there are almost 2,500 Americans
still missing in action in SE Asia.

53
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:27,824
Most are presumed dead, but for the
families, Congress and many Americans

54
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,577
it's still an emotional issue.

55
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:32,371
Give me something cold, please!

56
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:37,793
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

57
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:41,338
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.

58
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:45,300
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

59
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,138
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care,

60
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:55,852
but my committee cares. - It needs
proof that Americans are there.

61
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,729
Then we'll get 'em back.

62
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:03,527
If there are any of our men at the POW
target camp, you're to take photos.

63
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:08,031
Photos?
- Only photos. Under no circumstances

64
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,828
are you to engage the enemy.
- I'm supposed to leave them there?

65
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:16,123
I repeat:
Do not engage the enemy!

66
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:20,460
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman
will handle the extraction.

67
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,680
With your participation,
this mission has a better than average

68
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,890
chance of succeeding.

69
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,354
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

70
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,833
From Thailand across Laos
into the mountains of Vietnam.

71
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:03,337
You'll be flying a ceiling
of 250 feet when you bail out.

72
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,673
Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

73
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:11,386
Since you're going in solo, you'll have
to take more equipment than ever before.

74
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:15,600
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

75
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,685
Let technology do most of the work.

76
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:24,067
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.

77
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:28,654
Sir, I'm alive,
so it's still alive, isn't it?

78
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:42,251
You may find this hard
to believe, but all this is for you.

79
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,169
Impressed?

80
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,759
You'll get every modern piece of
equipment we have to ensure your safety.

81
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:55,055
You can feel totally safe because we
have the world's most advanced weapons.

82
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,728
I've always believed that the mind's
the best weapon. - Times change.

83
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:03,480
For some people.

84
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:06,317
Don't let me interrupt.

85
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,194
Upon insertion
call in to base camp on Transat.

86
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:15,242
Then proceed to rendezvous with your
ground contact, indigenous agent Co Bao.

87
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:17,745
Is he listening?

88
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,914
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

89
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,631
Colonel!

90
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,927
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?

91
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:38,307
What if he cracks under the pressure
in that hell? - Pressure?

92
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,727
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.

93
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:46,399
A pure fighting machine with only
a desire to win a war someone else lost.

94
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:52,029
If winning means he has to die,
he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

95
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,324
And one more thing:

96
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,703
What you call "hell", he calls home.

97
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:05,668
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!

98
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:31,401
D minus 20.

99
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:05,019
D minus 5.

100
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:26,081
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

101
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,005
If you run into trouble, try to get
to the hilltop extraction site.

102
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,471
Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

103
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,472
Ready to roll.

104
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,480
Murdock said he'd been
with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.

105
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:53,233
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

106
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,029
You're the only one that I trust.

107
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:42,991
Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

108
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:48,038
But there are people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

109
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:51,875
You don't sound too emotional about it.
- It wasn't my war, Colonel.

110
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,795
I'm here to clean up the mess.

111
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,007
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.

112
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,092
They're holding timeline.

113
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:44,928
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

114
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,381
We're back in the badlands, my man.

115
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,217
Stand by your position!

116
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,804
Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

117
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,069
5 seconds.

118
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,173
What's happening?
- He's hung up!

119
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,552
He'll be torn apart!

120
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:12,933
He's hung up! - What do you mean he's
hung up? - He's being dragged!

121
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:17,938
Cut him loose!
- I can't free him!

122
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,713
Abort the mission!
- That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

123
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,093
He's cutting away his equipment.

124
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,356
He's out!

125
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:06,028
Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
- Dragonfly 1, I read you.

126
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:10,074
Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

127
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:23,922
Maybe it's best to abort
the mission now. Who could survive that?

128
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,132
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

129
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:31,137
He's got 36 hours to complete the
mission and reach the extraction point.

130
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:34,515
We owe him that.
- Of course we do.

131
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:40,313
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.

132
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,668
Rambo!

133
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,185
You did not expect a woman, no?

134
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,189
We'd better go.

135
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:53,446
We go to river.
How come you so late?

136
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,448
I was hung up.

137
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:05,416
I have arranged boat to take us
down river. Old ways not safe.

138
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,879
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

139
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,225
You're using pirates?

140
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:09,855
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

141
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:32,105
What about patrol boats?

142
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:54,669
Russian.

143
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,323
Rambo,

144
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:26,784
want to eat?

145
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,996
Maybe later.

146
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:40,465
How you get into this?

147
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,387
It's a long story.
- Long trip.

148
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,602
After I left the special forces,

149
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:57,357
I moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

150
00:23:57,857 --> 00:23:59,025
I...

151
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:03,071
...came back to the States

152
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:05,823
and found another war going on.

153
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:09,285
What war?

154
00:24:10,203 --> 00:24:12,038
Kind of like a quiet war.

155
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:20,004
A war against the soldiers returning.
The kind of war you don't win.

156
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:29,138
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?

157
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:34,811
My father
worked for intelligence agency.

158
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:39,565
He killed, and I take his place.

159
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,526
There's too much death here.

160
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:43,695
Death everywhere.

161
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:49,450
I just want to live.

162
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:57,250
Maybe go America. Live the quiet life.

163
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:02,880
What you want?

164
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:07,759
To win. To survive.

165
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:13,432
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

166
00:25:13,932 --> 00:25:17,644
To survive a war,
you've got to become war.

167
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:21,566
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

168
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:28,531
I am expendable.

169
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:33,036
What mean "expendable"?

170
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:36,456
It's like

171
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:42,836
someone invites you to a party
and you don't show up,

172
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:45,298
and it doesn't really matter.

173
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:53,723
What's this?

174
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:57,143
It bring me good luck.

175
00:25:58,811 --> 00:26:01,105
What bring you good luck?

176
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,698
I guess this.

177
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:21,084
No further reports. - I want to go up
with the extraction team at dawn.

178
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,086
Denied.
- Denied?

179
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:26,256
It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

180
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:29,133
We don't even know if he's alive.
- Unlikely.

181
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:31,928
You said we'd go through as planned.

182
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:37,392
Okay, if you
want to go through with it, we will.

183
00:26:37,892 --> 00:26:40,144
The Colonel's
gonna be joining the extraction team.

184
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:45,149
You're a damned good man, Trautman.

185
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:45,001
See? Camp empty.

186
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:48,129
We move closer.

187
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:35,093
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

188
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:40,723
Come on!

189
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:59,826
What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

190
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:11,211
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.

191
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:12,922
What about orders?

192
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:15,341
No more orders, Co.

193
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:00,525
I've come to get you out.

194
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:03,820
Don't talk.

195
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:35,643
There are others.
- I'll be back.

196
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:16,411
Everything okay?

197
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,746
Let's go!

198
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:53,865
You have clearance.

199
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,409
Minus one hour to extraction.

200
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:59,913
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

201
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:02,414
Let's get moving.

202
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:26,564
A good thing you came when you did.

203
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,358
Why is that?

204
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,778
They move us around a lot. Because
of the crops. Only been there a week.

205
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:38,701
When were you last in that camp?
- A year. What year is it, anyway?

206
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:41,079
1985.

207
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,418
Camp supposed to be empty.

208
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,711
Yes, supposed to be.

209
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:26,164
Landing zone a mile up river.

210
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,394
What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

211
00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:32,273
You bastard!

212
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:11,311
Right, jump!
- I fight!

213
00:39:11,813 --> 00:39:13,106
Jump! Go on!

214
00:40:08,827 --> 00:40:10,329
The gunboat!

215
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:29,264
Jump!

216
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:43,655
You made it, Rambo!

217
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:53,081
Come on.

218
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:20,358
Take this. We go on from here.

219
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:24,237
Better I stay on to end.
- This is the end.

220
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:26,739
Come on.

221
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,284
Rambo!

222
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:32,787
You not expendable.

223
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:58,396
Colonel, 3 minutes.

224
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:12,262
That's Rambo!

225
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:20,269
Christ, he's found one!

226
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,927
Rambo's found one of ours!

227
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:58,766
The ground crew has what appears to be
an American POW with him.

228
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:03,061
What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.

229
00:44:04,188 --> 00:44:06,733
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!

230
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:10,278
Everybody out! Move!

231
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:13,030
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!

232
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:20,079
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.

233
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,249
Come on!

234
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:29,797
Abort the operation immediately!

235
00:44:30,298 --> 00:44:33,760
This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
- Say it again, Coach 1.

236
00:44:34,177 --> 00:44:35,802
Abort the operation!

237
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:41,099
I've been ordered to abort.
- But we've got them in sight!

238
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,186
Murdock, do you read?

239
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,068
We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.

240
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:57,450
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!

241
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:01,788
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

242
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:09,921
Colonel!

243
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:11,881
Down!

244
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:56,092
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

245
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,970
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.

246
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,139
You had your suspicions,
which makes you a sort of accessory.

247
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,268
Don't ever
count me with you and your scum!

248
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:09,939
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.

249
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,983
What are you talking about?

250
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:15,153
That camp was supposed to be empty.

251
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:20,742
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.

252
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:26,581
And if he happens to get caught,
nobody knows except you.

253
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:29,626
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

254
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:36,132
A stinking bureaucrat who's trying to
cover his ass. - A nation's!

255
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:41,054
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If
he had done what he was meant to do,

256
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:46,017
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

257
00:46:46,476 --> 00:46:50,688
And if those pictures showed something,
they'd have been lost.

258
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:53,650
You still don't understand
what this is all about.

259
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,693
Same as always: Money.

260
00:46:57,195 --> 00:47:00,322
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.

261
00:47:00,822 --> 00:47:03,409
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

262
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:06,621
And you're doing the same thing
all over again.

263
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:08,581
What would you do?

264
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,670
Pay ransom for our men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

265
00:47:14,128 --> 00:47:16,798
And if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

266
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:22,135
Do you want to start the war over again
and bomb Hanoi?

267
00:47:22,595 --> 00:47:28,559
You think the Senate's going to pay
billions for a few forgotten ghosts?

268
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:32,771
For men! Men who fought
for their country! - That's enough!

269
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:38,945
Trautman, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

270
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:43,282
You bastard!
- And if I were you,

271
00:47:43,782 --> 00:47:48,538
I'd not make the mistake of bringing it
up again. - You're making the mistake.

272
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:50,498
Yes? What mistake?

273
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,209
Rambo.

274
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:55,688
Damned Russian bastards.

275
00:49:20,296 --> 00:49:22,131
He's dead now.

276
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:33,893
Bring him up!

277
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:55,039
The knife!

278
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,334
These people
are so vulgar in their methods!

279
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:01,713
They lack compassion.

280
00:50:04,423 --> 00:50:07,844
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

281
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,847
I do not know who you are yet,

282
00:50:12,347 --> 00:50:14,142
but I will.

283
00:50:14,601 --> 00:50:16,144
Take him and clean him up.

284
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,430
That's all.

285
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,726
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

286
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:04,692
I see you are no stranger to pain.

287
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:08,695
Perhaps you have been
among my Vietnamese comrades before?

288
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:12,909
No answer?

289
00:51:14,077 --> 00:51:16,496
Do you wish to give your name?

290
00:51:16,996 --> 00:51:20,250
What possible harm can that cause?

291
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:26,047
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

292
00:51:26,923 --> 00:51:30,300
What you must understand
is that we must interrogate you.

293
00:51:32,971 --> 00:51:36,974
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment.

294
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:40,936
But for me you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

295
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:44,773
just opposed by an act of fate.

296
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:48,443
I know you were trying

297
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:53,324
to facilitate the release
of war criminals. I can appreciate this.

298
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:58,454
But this incident, your capture, is...

299
00:52:00,456 --> 00:52:01,666
...embarrassing.

300
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,168
We must have an explanation.

301
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:10,675
Radio your HQ and say that
you have been captured and condemned

302
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:17,472
for espionage, and that attempts like
these should not be made in the future,

303
00:52:17,974 --> 00:52:22,604
or they
will meet with the same fate as you.

304
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:33,447
Fuck you!

305
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:39,579
You wish to test your strength... Good.

306
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:45,751
Yushin!

307
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:47,521
Comrade, here is something

308
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:51,150
that might be of interest to you:

309
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:55,405
A transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

310
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:59,242
and his commander that we intercepted.

311
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:05,039
"Dragonfly" and "Wolf's Den"...
Colorful names.

312
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:07,041
Here we are:

313
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:14,548
"We have them in sight". And the reply:
"Abort the operation immediately. "

314
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:20,346
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over. "

315
00:54:21,514 --> 00:54:26,144
It seems you were abandoned
by direct command.

316
00:54:26,644 --> 00:54:29,896
And these are the people
you protect with your pain!

317
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:32,983
Increase the voltage.

318
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,322
You may scream. There is no shame.

319
00:55:09,144 --> 00:55:11,856
You are strong! Very strong!

320
00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:14,150
The strongest so far.

321
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:18,320
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.

322
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:22,200
Make the radio call.

323
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:49,894
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

324
00:56:04,826 --> 00:56:08,079
Yushin
has a memento for you of this day.

325
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:32,561
Put it in his eye.

326
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:43,322
If your own life
means nothing to you, perhaps his does.

327
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:47,492
Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

328
00:56:57,503 --> 00:56:58,838
Yes?

329
00:57:34,374 --> 00:57:35,833
Don't do it!

330
00:57:38,086 --> 00:57:39,503
Do it

331
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,422
now!

332
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:13,288
Two-two-zero-five-six...

333
00:58:14,163 --> 00:58:16,416
Lone Wolf receive.

334
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:20,461
This is Lone Wolf...

335
00:58:21,336 --> 00:58:25,508
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
Transmit location and status.

336
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:29,012
What is it?
- It's Rambo, Sir.

337
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:33,182
We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.

338
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:37,644
I say again:
What is your position? Over.

339
00:58:39,146 --> 00:58:42,942
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

340
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:46,905
This is Trautman. Where are you?

341
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,077
Come in!

342
00:59:02,128 --> 00:59:03,086
Murdock...

343
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,132
He's here.

344
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,931
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.

345
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:18,061
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

346
00:59:26,945 --> 00:59:27,987
Murdock...

347
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:33,326
I'm coming to get you!

348
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:56,927
Duck!

349
01:03:02,242 --> 01:03:03,452
This way.

350
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:43,742
We safe for now.

351
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:52,626
You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

352
01:03:53,711 --> 01:03:55,838
Maybe need this.

353
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,427
You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

354
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,727
Listen...

355
01:04:10,644 --> 01:04:13,731
What you did back there...

356
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:16,526
...I won't forget it.

357
01:04:18,193 --> 01:04:19,237
Thanks.

358
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:23,282
What you do now?

359
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,160
Try get across through Thailand?

360
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:29,372
Yeah.
- Then go America?

361
01:04:36,461 --> 01:04:38,548
You take me with you?

362
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:51,269
You take me?

363
01:04:53,646 --> 01:04:54,606
Yeah.

364
01:04:57,775 --> 01:04:59,652
I think you make good choice.

365
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:04,240
We go?
- Let's go.

366
01:05:41,778 --> 01:05:43,363
You alright?

367
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:59,796
You... not... forget... me.

368
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:01,506
No.

369
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:22,360
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

370
01:06:22,818 --> 01:06:28,825
You're risking everything. Do you think
one man's worth all that? - Yes.

371
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:33,538
I order you to withdraw.
- I'll go over your head.

372
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:38,376
You don't seem to understand that I'm
in charge here. You're just a tool.

373
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:42,213
We're the machine.

374
01:06:42,713 --> 01:06:45,048
He's not to leave the base.

375
01:06:49,762 --> 01:06:54,474
He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said: He went home.

376
01:21:09,204 --> 01:21:10,289
Get back.

377
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:17,629
Come on! To the chopper!

378
01:21:18,088 --> 01:21:19,214
Move!

379
01:21:19,715 --> 01:21:21,800
To the chopper!

380
01:21:38,525 --> 01:21:40,027
Move!

381
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,186
You guys made it!

382
01:22:52,224 --> 01:22:54,184
Chopper on your tail!

383
01:22:55,811 --> 01:22:57,271
Hang on!

384
01:24:26,402 --> 01:24:27,444
Hold on!

385
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:36,036
Fire in the tail!

386
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:42,454
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

387
01:26:43,956 --> 01:26:47,210
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

388
01:26:47,918 --> 01:26:51,588
Wolf's Den,
this is Lone wolf, do you read?

389
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:55,634
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

390
01:26:56,094 --> 01:27:00,847
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.

391
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:17,239
You heard. Prepare for landing of POWs!

392
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:36,193
Glad you made it.

393
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:50,183
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

394
01:29:50,684 --> 01:29:52,811
I take them, just like you.

395
01:29:57,065 --> 01:30:00,944
I swear to God I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

396
01:30:01,403 --> 01:30:04,239
It was just supposed
to be another assignment.

397
01:30:11,455 --> 01:30:12,497
Mission...

398
01:30:14,082 --> 01:30:15,792
...accomplished!

399
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:25,469
You know there are more men out there.

400
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:28,055
You know where they are.

401
01:30:30,349 --> 01:30:33,978
Find them, or I'll find you!

402
01:30:58,961 --> 01:31:00,754
Where are you going?

403
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,923
I don't know.

404
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:07,636
You'll get
a second Medal of Honor for this.

405
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:20,148
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.

406
01:31:21,483 --> 01:31:24,987
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

407
01:31:25,487 --> 01:31:27,614
Come back to us.

408
01:31:28,824 --> 01:31:30,576
Back to what?

409
01:31:31,702 --> 01:31:34,246
My friends died here,

410
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:37,541
and part of me died here.

411
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:44,172
The war may have been wrong,
but don't hate your country for it.

412
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:46,259
Hate it?

413
01:31:47,509 --> 01:31:49,177
I'd die for it!

414
01:31:50,929 --> 01:31:52,973
What is it you want?

415
01:31:58,186 --> 01:32:00,022
I want

416
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:04,192
what they want,

417
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,863
and every other guy who came out here

418
01:32:08,363 --> 01:32:12,618
and spilt his guts
and gave everything he had:

419
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,997
For our country to love us

420
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:19,583
as much as we love it.

421
01:32:22,295 --> 01:32:24,046
That's what I want.

422
01:32:30,677 --> 01:32:34,473
How will you live, John?
- Day by day.
