Oh, my God.

36
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:34,643
- You might at least have lifted my veil!
- Oh, my God. Still love me?

37
00:03:34,686 --> 00:03:37,154
- Did I ever?
- Lift the bloody veil, Vera.

38
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,120
Look at you.

39
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,441
Look at you. Not been called up?

40
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:49,399
Just because I haven't got a uniform.
It's me that puts the heart in the nation.

- Amongst other things, I loved...
- Don't you come it, Dylan Thomas!

- You haven't changed.
- Course I have, thank God.

You can't. And don't. Not ever.

46

If you do, I won't let you.

47
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,676
I heard you on the radio.

48
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:11,115
Like going home, it was, your poems.
Like going back.

49
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:14,958
- Where's the posh accent from?
- You should've looked me up.

50
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,883
- Should I?
- Mm.

51
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,684
If I can get all my friends to donate
five bob each, this is the plan, see.

52

If I get them all to do that, I don't have to sell
my soul writing bloody propaganda films.

53

- I can write my bloody poetry.
- You'd have to join the army.

So... lend us five bob.

- I'll give you a snout, that's all you'll get.
- Oh. Give us, then.

00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:52,084
- Silver's for the lonely, Vera Bera.
- Who says I'm lonely?

59
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,277
- Well, where's the man who'll give you gold?
- That an offer, is it?

60
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,602
- It's always been shares with us.
- You never had anything to share.

61
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:02,195
Yes, but if I did,
if ever I did, you'd be the first.

00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:21,037
I had a golden childhood, Anita.
And here it is turning up all unexpected.

Spare us the bloody tragedy, man.
I need something hopeful here.

Jehovah had scored

- Where's our son?

Chopped up in little bits and packed

The police'll be chasing you.

114
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,479
- Don't pretend you want him here.
- There's bombs!

115
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:45,077
It's nothing to do with bombs.
You don't want him. So I didn't bring him.

116
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:51,003
I've never been a father before, Cat.
It's not straightforward.

117
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:54,197
- Still the light of your life, am I?
- In the New Forest, is he?

118
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:58,205
Why are you asking, Dullun?
You know damn well our son's with my mother.

119
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,282
I love you, Cat.

120
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,715
Give us a fag, then.

121
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:06,805
I'm out of bleeding fags.
Give my head a good scratch. Please?

122

Oh, lovely!

123
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,797

- Nowhere.

- Scratch your own bloody head!

125
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,445
- Come here.
- No.

126
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:19,158
Kiss me.

128
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:33,403
Excuse me.
You dropped your handkerchief.

129
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,360
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Right there.

130
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,398
It's not mine, sorry.

131
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:44,155
You're supposed to take the hankie,
I'm supposed to introduce myself,

132
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,879
- buy you a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

133
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:52,842
- Nice try, though.
- I've never done this before.

134
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:56,276
No. You've just never
been caught out before.

135
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,844
Hello, darling.

136
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:10,518
- Sod you, then!
- Oh, dear. Picky, picky, picky.

137
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:14,445
- You're late.
- I know. It's all her fault.

138
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,924
- Who's your friend?
- Queen of Ireland,

139
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:25,721
love of my life, mother of my child,
Caitlin Thomas.

140
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,719
Your wife, Dylan?

141
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:32,556
The one and only.

142
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:38,955
- He didn't mention...
- Well, he wouldn't, would he?

143
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:45,480
You made that, didn't you?

144
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:49,238
I might like you.

145
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,880
Then again, I might not.

146
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:55,401
I'll await your decision, shall I?

147
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,754
I won't hold my breath, mind.

148
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,960
- Got a mansion we could share?
- Yes. Two little homeless orphans.

149
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:08,761
- I've only got a room.
- Bugger. Condemned to her sister's.

150
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,876
I'll be having that, sailor boy.

151
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:14,316
- Needn't let...
- Small matter of a wife?

152
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:20,757
- Nothing should ever come between us.
- Oh, God, Dylan.

153
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,195
Soul mates, we are, Vera. Always were.

154
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:27,080
- Don't.
- Stop talking about me.

155
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:32,915
There's a phone in the hall
where I stay. You know.

156
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:37,243
If you want me, he's got my number.

157
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:43,524
What does it mean when she smiles?

158
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:47,082
I don't know. Never did.

159
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,196
(Knocking)

160
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:56,281
God help us.
It's the Visigoths from Wales.

161
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:58,963
Your sister's here.

162
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,719
Back from strangling Germans, then, are you?

163
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:05,280
Left the other boys playing with their little pistols.

164
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:08,762
- All ging-gang-gooley and yo-ho-ho.
- (Caitlin giggles)

165
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:11,081
That what you call poetry, is it?

166
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:14,118
Look, give us a bed
and we'll stay out from under your feet.

167
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:23,678
# Maybe it's because I kissed you too much

168
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:34,082
# Maybe that is why
my kiss means too little

169
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:50,277
# Maybe with a love so great
and a love so small

170
00:12:51,686 --> 00:13:02,005
# Maybe I'll be left with no love at all

171
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:15,874
# Maybe I'll be left with no love at all #

172
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:24,957
(Applause)

173
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,036
(Air-raid siren)

174
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:37,843
Sometimes I can nurse a single pint
all night. But that's sometimes.

175
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:40,518
(Slurred) Thank you.

176
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,678
(Soldier) Oh, yeah! I thought it was hilarious.

177
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:48,596
I'll get them in.
You pay, though, Vera, eh? Fair dos.

178
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:51,997
- Support the starving poet.
- You are not a bloody poet, Dylan.

179
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,322
You write films about barrage
sodding balloons for your living.

180
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,845
There is a war on.

181
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,877
You know, you're not the man I married.

182
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:03,158
I did cartwheels in a rubber corset in Peter
Robinson's window when I was hungry.

183
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:05,720
You were never hungry.
You've always had a man to feed you.

184
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:08,963
Demonstration purposes it was.
Bet you can't beat that.

185
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:11,042
Bet I can't.

186
00:14:14,206 --> 00:14:16,197
He's following me.

187
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:20,241
Don't you have all the luck!

188
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:21,605
Watch this.

189
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,721
(Men cheer)

190
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:36,522
- Causing chaos, my lovely.
- What do you need knickers for?

191
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,603
Looking for a good time
with a couple of showgirls?

192
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:44,841
Three more, please.
Your drinks, chaps.

193
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:49,801
- Chief stag sees off the competition.
- William Killick.

194
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,797
Vera Phillips.
She's very pleased to meet you.

195
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:59,121
- Rums all round?
- Mmm, goody!

196
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,679
Four rums, please.

197
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:07,000
- Do you do cartwheels?
- On the seashore I might.

198
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:09,685
Ah. I'll take you there.

199
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:13,915
- You're busy, by the looks of you.
- I could do with some sea air.

200
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,443
I'd like to sit on the beach with you.

201
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:19,237
Don't you know a brush-off
when you get one?

202
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,322
(Caitlin) Got any smokes?

203
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,641
I enjoyed your show.

204
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,324
- Did you?
- Yes.

205
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,955
- Hey?
- Hay's for horses.

206
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,724
Come for a gallop.

207
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:36,277
Used to call it busking,
singing in the tube stations.

208
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,794
Coppers used to move you on.

209
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,117
I'll come again, if I may.

210
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:44,559
Free world.

211
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,801
(Explosion)

212
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:56,962
(Woman sobs)

213
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:01,884
(Laughter)

214
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:08,602
Keeping those rums to yourself?
We're in danger of breaking a thirst.

215
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:11,683
I don't melt at the sight of a uniform, that's all.

216
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:16,402
- Sod it. I don't like nosy parkers.
- It was a civil question.

217
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:19,244
I could have said,
"Are you after my husband?" But I didn't.

218
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,641
(Toilet flushes)

219
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:25,201
Heartache, that's what I see in a uniform.

220
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:27,635
I won't love someone
just to have them die on me.

221
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,837
Who's talking about love?
Don't you ever get lonely?

222
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:34,196
- My work's all I need.
- I used to think I'd be a dancer.

223
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:36,282
Danced night and day.

224
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,200
I know, you're one of those.

225
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:44,477
No. No! God!

226
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:47,199
Not one of those, for God's sake!
Not that I'm averse.

227
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:50,556
One of the ones
that never got over her first love.

228
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:54,126
Course I am.

229
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,285
(Air-raid siren)

230
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,124
(Killick) Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

231
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,203
- All I said...
- You can walk on your own, I know.

232
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:06,079
Keep your hand on your ha'penny,
that's what my mother taught me.

233
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:10,119
- I'm not touching you.
- Well, don't look at me either.

234
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,838
Fine.

235
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:14,195
No, don't do that!

236
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:18,524
What have you got against me,
Vera Phillips?

237
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,756
You might be dead tomorrow.

238
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:24,639
Live while you can, live all you can.

239
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:30,242
- I won't see you again.
- Of course not.

240
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,596
I'd like my torch back.

241
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:41,924
Please.

242
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,764
- (Clattering)
- (Caitlin) Don't let the light out!

243
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,274
(Dylan) Light of your life.

244
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:02,316
(Caitlin) Has to wipe its feet
before it comes back in again.

245
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,800
(Laughter)

246
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:07,919
(Caitlin) No!

247
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,117
(Dylan) Cat! Cat!

248
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:17,399
- Little dog needs the toilet.
- (Moans)

249
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,676
Go bark somewhere else.

250
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,799
Come on, Catty.

251
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:37,566
Have you got a poem for me?

252
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:40,837
- You still owe me for the last one.
- (Chuckles)

253
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:46,557
I am not a sodding deposit box, Dylan.

254
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:57,440
What do you think this is?

255
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,956
- It could be a scribble!
- Could be.

256
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,679
- It could be a bloody limerick, Dullun!
- Could be.

257
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:13,554
Among Those Killed In The Dawn Raid
Was A Man Aged A Hundred.

258
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:16,404
- Happy piece, is it?
- Do you want to hear it?

259
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,723
Do you?

260
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,836
Do you want to hear it?

261
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,803
Oh, heavy!

262
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,802
When the morning
was waking over the war

263
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:41,522
He put on his clothes
and stepped out and he died

264
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:46,998
The locks yawned loose
as a blast blew them wide

265
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:49,606
He dropped where he loved
on the burst pavement...

266
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,841
- Lived.
- What?

267
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,275
Lived.

268
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,601
Oh, no, it's loved.

269
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:59,285
You can't read your own bloody writing.
Lived! Lived!

270
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:01,715
- Loved!
- He's a hundred sodding years old!

271
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,165
He can't remember love.

272
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:05,481
The bloody word's only
there because I wrote it!

273
00:20:05,526 --> 00:20:07,244
Dropped where he loved

274
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,516
- on the burst pavement stone
- Shh!

275
00:20:13,526 --> 00:20:15,960
It's mine, isn't it?

276
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,162
What you write.

277
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:22,241
All my words.

278
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,959
And every heartbeat.

279
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,315
They're all for you.

280
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,038
Me?

281
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:33,436
Come here, then.

282
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,956
Come on, you!

283
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,598
(Giggling)

284
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:40,364
(Footsteps)

285
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:47,402
Get out of bed and come and see
what he's done this time!

286
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:53,363
Oh, dear. Naughty doggy Dylan.

287
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:55,966
Do you know what that is?

288
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:59,999
That's animal behaviour, that's what it is.

289
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:02,116
Nicolette, I'm...

290
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,795
I'm... (Laughs)

291
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,997
Is Vera Phillips there, please?

292
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:12,321
- <i>(Woman) Just a moment.</i>
- Thank you.

293
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:18,277
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, darling.

294
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:20,123
- <i>Dylan?</i>
- Course it is.

295
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:25,159
(Dylan) There was a young hero called Killick

296
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:28,482
Who marched to the top of a... hillick

297
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:31,846
He stood legs astride
and whipped out his pride

298
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:34,354
And spread Brylcreem all over his fillick

299
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:36,362
What's a fillick?

300
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:40,081
- Showing your ignorance now, Cat.
- William's will be nice, whatever it is.

301
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,435
(Caitlin) Not that you're seeing him again.

302
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:46,274
- He'll still have a nice one.
- Come here, Vera Bera.

303
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,075
Come on. Come and have a cuddle.

304
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:55,801
Go on, you're welcome to it. I don't want him.

305
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,844
Don't change, Vera Bera.

306
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:11,763
You're the star in my dark sky.
Don't you ever change.

307
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:15,879
- What am I in your sky?
- You're on my earth, Caitlin.

308
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:18,121
Just where I want you to be. Come on.

309
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,361
Come and have a cuddle.

310
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,802
(Laughs)

311
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:32,275
What are you laughing at? What?

312
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:33,884
What?

313
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:35,154
What is it?

314
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:38,676
- (Both laugh)
- What? What?

315
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:41,240
(Laughter continues)

316
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,595
It's like living with children.

317
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,876
(Laughter continues)

318
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,805
- Oh, God!
- (Dylan) I'm going to the pub.

319
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,204
(Door closes)

320
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:08,076
What's it like having a son?

321
00:23:08,126 --> 00:23:10,082
Oh, exhausting.

322
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:13,877
I can't imagine it.

323
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:18,083
He's a whole world away from here.

324
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:23,119
- Safe and sound.
- (Air-raid siren)

325
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:29,435
(Killick) You could die in an air raid.

326
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,602
- (Vera) I'm not going to.
- You might.

327
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:34,160
(Vera) This is not
how I would choose to seduce someone.

328
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:37,516
(Killick)
My firm intention is to live forever.

329
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,399
- Is that a promise?
- Cross my heart.

330
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,602
(Vera sighs)

331
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:55,679
You only think you're in love with the poet.
You know that, don't you?

332
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,479
His name's Dylan.
You can say Dylan, can't you?

333
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:01,677
- So, you admit you're in love with him?
- Bloody lawyer, are you?

334
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:06,277
I'm not saying I'm the better man,
but I'm not married, Vera.

335
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:09,523
And you'll admit that gives me an advantage.

336
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,238
I'll admit nothing.

337
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:13,925
- On the grounds that it may incriminate you?
- (Laughs)

338
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:16,844
You're trying to provoke me, aren't you?

339
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:22,483
First love's all right as far as it goes.

340
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:25,916
Last love, that's what I'm interested in.

341
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,481
(Scoffs) Oh, you think you're so damn wise.

342
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,758
(Vera giggles)

343
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:51,394
- What do you want, Vera?
- Oh...

344
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:55,325
the moon from out of the skies,
the stars in all their glitter.

345
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,516
What else?

346
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:01,639
It makes you know you're alive, wanting.
That's what I think.

347
00:25:01,686 --> 00:25:03,517
Oh, I'm alive all right.

348
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,522
Every last bit of me.

349
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,395
Oh! Stay there.

350
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,924
- Right, stay still.
- All right!

351
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:21,724
- Still!
- (Laughs)

352
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:29,319
- I'm as good as he is.
- Good as who is?

353
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:31,800
Dylan. The bugger.

354
00:25:32,926 --> 00:25:37,363
He thinks that I am put on this earth
to nurture his talent.

355
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:43,003
Cook for him, have his children, clean for him.
That's all I'm here for.

356
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:47,755
Who's nurturing my bloody talent?

357
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:52,115
- Will William nurture your talent?
- I'll nurture my own.

358
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,723
Cut off his trigger finger, that's what I'd do.

359
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:59,326
I would, I'd come up quietly in the night

360
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:03,678
and I'd tie him down and I'd... maim him.

361
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:16,442
Look at us. How do they live up to us?

362
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:19,717
(Laughs) They don't, dirty tarts!

363
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:21,722
(Air-raid sirens)

364
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,360
(Both giggle)

365
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:31,876
(Heavy thudding and grunting)

366
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,476
- My brother died for the likes of you!
- I didn't bloody ask him to, did I?

367
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,723
Bleeding conchie! Lick my bleeding boot!

368
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,961
Welsh seamen. You can smell them a mile off.

369
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:44,475
- I ain't got no quarrel with you!
- Damn right!

370
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:46,642
What are you protecting him for? Scum, he is!

371
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:50,361
Get back to your drinking. Now. Go on.

372
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:58,325
He's right, you know.
Contamination, that's what I am.

373
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,436
I'd stay well clear.

374
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:05,321
No, no, no. I'm just gonna stay down here
a moment. Just... just a little moment.

375
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:09,723
- You're lying in piss, Dylan.
- (Sighs) I've had worse beds.

376
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,241
I wouldn't like to get
on the wrong side of you.

377
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:18,915
- Well, see you don't, then.
- (Laughs and gasps)

378
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,082
You bloody warriors.

379
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:24,914
You're a bunch of buggering yes men.
You don't even know what you're fighting for.

380
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:28,754
- To live without fear, me and mine.
- Ta.

381
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:33,156
(Dylan groans)

382
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:37,324
Oh, God!

383
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,402
(Sighs)

384
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:45,282
Terrified, I am, of not... not doing.

385
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:49,160
War, see, it's useful.
It gives the terror a focus.

386
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:52,084
Is she in there? Vera?

387
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:59,558
All you heroes, you think the women just
fall at your feet at the sight of you, don't you?

388
00:27:59,606 --> 00:28:01,005
You think they don't?

389
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:06,394
Of course, if I could be born again,
I'd have a word with God.

390
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:10,439
"Make me a hero", I'd say.
This way is far too much bloody hard work.

391
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:12,795
- Come on.
- What, go on living?

392
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:16,236
I've a cure for funk.

393
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:18,800
- Death, that's the only cure.
- Double?

394
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,962
- You offering?
- (Laughs)

395
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:24,715
(Killick) # There was a young poet called Dylan

396
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:29,396
# Who swore that he never would kill 'em

397
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:34,474
# When called by his country
to serve at the front

398
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,962

00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:40,679

400
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:42,398
(Killick laughs)

401
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,599
<i>(Dylan) Possessed by the skies</i>

402
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:55,639

403
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,598
<i>I may without fail</i>

404
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:04,915
Suffer the first vision
that set fire to the stars

405
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,595
Touch her and I'll kill you.

406
00:29:11,046 --> 00:29:13,321
Caitlin's territory, is she?

407
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:19,080
Caitlin's friend.

408
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:13,960
# Hang out the stars in Indiana

409
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:18,635

Here.

413
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,803
- I can buy my own drink.
- Just take the bloody thing.

414
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:37,158
- (Rumbling)
- # A melody just meant for two #

415
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:39,925
- Care to dance?
- I'd love to, thank you.

416
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:43,756
Don't worry, they won't get us down here.

417
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:51,482
# How could I find in things I sought for?

418
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:54,120
# No wonder they were all denied

419
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:58,435
# The very happiness I fought for #

420
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:00,795
- My round.
- Don't be childish.

421
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:04,725
- Gin drinkers, are they, the children you know?
- Dance. Come on.

422
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:07,803
I'm an independent woman.
I can buy a round if I want to.

423
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:10,963
- And a fight, you can have that too.
- All right, then.

424
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:14,397
After a dance.

425
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:17,836
# Hang out the stars in Indiana

(Woman laughs)

428
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:29,602
- I won't always do as you say.
- Thank you for the warning.

429
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:33,434
- I won't.
- Just dance.

430
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:36,797

437
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:11,722
(Man) Where are you? Mary?

438
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:15,517
(Screaming)

439
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:26,520

- (Killick) Come on!

440
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:29,364
- This way.
- (Man) I need help over here, now.

441
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:35,396
(Rumbling and crashing)

442
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:42,519
Vera! Vera. Vera, you can leave her now.

443
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:45,922
- No, the pavement's wet!
- No, she won't feel it.

444
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,161
Hmm? Leave her now.

445
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:50,276
(Gasps)

446
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:56,275
Come on. It's all right. It's all right.

447
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:58,794
- It's all right.
- (Rumbling)

448
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,440
Come on. It's all right. It's all right.

449

# For in my heart there'll be a love song

00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:34,443
# A song I long to sing to you #

(Shouting)

456
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:47,114
I bet you lay this on the ground.

457
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:52,877
- Why would I do that?
- For all the girls.

458
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:55,394
You won't get me on...

459
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:01,203
(Woman screams)

460
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:03,316
Those people, William.

461
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,839
- Shh.
- All those people.

462
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:19,915
You've got a raindrop
running down down your cheek.

463
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:23,636
Just like a tear.

464
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:34,116
Make love to me.

465
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,202
(Vera sighs)

466
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:33,199
No harm will ever come to you.

467
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:37,239
Not from me. Not from anyone else.

468
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,595
Not while I'm here.

469
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:43,439
No word of mine will ever hurt you.

470
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,041
That sounds like a vow.

I'm not sure where to put.

- It's not finished, then?
- No, strictly speaking.

- Special one.

499
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:22,076
- No.
- What?

500
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,004
You can't make me.
What if I can't love you?

501
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:28,675
- I've been posted, Vera.
- Well, that's a hell of a proposal.

502
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,600
I... love... you.

503

- No. You don't make the decisions any more.
- No.

505

- Say it. Say it.
- Uh-uh. No.

506
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:43,401
- Say, "I'll marry you."
- (Laughs) No.

507
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:46,483
Say it. Say yes. Say yes. Yes!

508
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:50,280
- Yes! Say yes!
- (Caitlin and Dylan) Yes!

509
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:53,796
- Say yes!
- Oh, for God's sake, say yes!

Seduced me when I was 15, the old goat.

512
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:06,679
It doesn't mean anything, fucking. It's not love.

513
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:08,956
I get an itch, it's gotta be scratched.

514
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,076
I'd do it myself, only I'm too lazy.

515
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:14,641
Why bother, when you can get
someone else to do it for you?

516
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:18,725
- Nothing to do with love, fucking?
- Uh-uh. Nothing.

- Who was your first?
- What?

518
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:28,558
You don't need to tell me. I know it was Dylan.

519
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:33,718
We were kids. Tents piled in a beach hut.

520
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:37,395
- Nice and comfy, then.
- We were children, still innocent.

521
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:40,279
We are still innocent, me and Dylan.

522
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:43,926
I only want it as a memory. I don't want it back.

523

524
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:50,242
Don't ever tell him.
I can forgive the past, he won't.

a few feathers and a piece of cloth?

540
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:10,515
- Where did you get three guineas?
- He wrote a cheque. It'll bounce, of course.

00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:18,480
(Gasps)

682
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,801
<i>(Dylan) Forgive us</i>

683
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,316
<i>Forgive us your death</i>
<i>that myselves the believers</i>

684
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:26,675
<i>May hold it in a great flood</i>

685
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,035
<i>Till the blood shall spurt</i>

686
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:31,680
<i>And the dust shall sing like a bird</i>

687
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,994
<i>As the grains blow,</i>
<i>as your death grows, through our heart</i>

688
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,189
<i>Crying</i>

689
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,229
<i>Your dying</i>

690
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,269
<i>Cry</i>

691
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,074
<i>Child beyond cockcrow by the fire-dwarfed</i>

692
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,511
<i>Street we chant the flying sea</i>

693
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,028
<i>In the body bereft</i>

694
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,636
Come on. Sleep tight.

695
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,353
- (Child) I'm hungry.
- Shh.

696
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,709
Baby is sleeping.

697
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,157
It's bloody freezing! Bloody Wales!

698
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,955
(Sighs)

699
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,231
When I was little, my da always
used to warm me like this.

700
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,192
- You loved him?
- Adored him.

701
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,516
- I hated mine.
- You didn't hate him. Not hate.

702
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,869
He was loathsome.

703
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,277
Pity you're not a man.
If you were a man, I'd fancy you.

704
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,278
(Snorts and laughs)

705
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,197
Don't think I didn't know you were there.

706
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,913
- I didn't.
- I could smell him.

707
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,919
Come here, Dylan. Let Vera smell you,
smell the woman on you.

708
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,428
- Stop it.
- She thinks I should twiddle my thumbs while...

709
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,029
- What? What?
- Don't wake the kids, Dylan.

710
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,038
So where are they, Caitlin, hm?
Where are your little friends?

711
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,596
Come on, boys. Out you come.
Feeding time. (Laughs)

712
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,552
- Ow! She's killing me! Vera!
- (Children crying)

713
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,556
I will kill you! I will!

714
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,397
If I catch you at it again, I will!

715
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,477
Why don't you see to the kids, Caitlin? Go on.

716
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,229
(Barking)

717
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,192
- Why do you do it?
- I don't do anything.

718
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,588
I do it, sleep with other women...

719
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,234
- Hello.
- Morning.

720
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,556
...because I'm a poet, and a poet feeds off life.

721
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,750
- (Laughs)
- What?

722
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,155
Pompous sod, aren't you?

723
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,192
I do it because she does it.

724
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,471
She always has. She can't help herself.

725
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,034
It doesn't mean anything to her.

726
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,868
You don't need William. You've got me.

727
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,508
Nothing but you and me with time on our hands

728
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,120
and each other to spend it with.

729
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,596
(Door closes)

730
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,676
(Footsteps)

731
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,916
Hello, Daisy.

732
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,190
Come back with me. Come on.

733
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,632
I'll take you back to a time
when we were safe.

734
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,708
Where no bombs fell from the sky
and no one died, ever.

735
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,990
You can't go back.

736
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,591
We can.

737
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,148
You and me.

738
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,350
It's not real.

739
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,310
It is if we want it to be.

740
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,628
Pity about the poor bloody husband.

741
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,116
Off bleeding for his country
and paying for the fun back home.

742
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,350
Don't mind if I join you, do you?

743
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,270
(Sighs)

744
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,948
(Woman) Room for a small one?

745
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,309
Ooh, wartime luxury.

746
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,678
(Yells)

747
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,957
(Woman) You can drop me here.

748
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,831
(Brakes squeal)

749
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,313
(Yells)

750
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,799
(Dylan) Cat?
(Woman) That looks nasty.

751
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,989
Catty, Catty. Cat, Cat, Cat.
