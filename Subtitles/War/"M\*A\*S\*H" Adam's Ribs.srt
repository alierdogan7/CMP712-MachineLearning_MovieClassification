00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:43,801
I'm over here in Korea doing
a story on our star-freckled

174
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:46,806
- Wow!
- I'm doing a backgrounder
on a Windy City boy...

175
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:48,808
and I need to know something:

176
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,810
Across the street from the station,
down the block...

177
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:52,869
there's a five-and-ten...
and right next to that...

178
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:55,279
there's a dry cleaning
and dyeing place.

179
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:58,284
And right next to that,
there's this place that sells ribs.

180
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:02,049
What's the name... Adam's Ribs!
That's it. Adam's Ribs.

182
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,890
- That's it. That's it. Mm!
- You'll smear it.

183
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:11,955
I got it engraved on my tongue.
Listen, you got a telephone book there?

184
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:15,593
Uh, all right... I want you
to look up the number for me!

185
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,603
Look, I know you're busy,
mister.

186
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:21,937
Um, what is your name, please?
For the article.

187
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,944
Resnick?
Bernard Resnick?

188
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:27,173
Is that with an "S" or a "Z"?

189
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:29,842
Uh, thank you,
Mr. Resnick.

190
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:34,786
That's a lovely name.
One of my daughters is called Resnick.

191
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,255

Thank you, Mr. Resnick.
God bless your choo-choos.

196
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:55,174
Operator?
I want DEarborn 5-2750.

197
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,678
This is it, Radar.
We're approaching nirvana.

198
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,680
Is that near Chicago?

199
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,381
Hello?
What do you mean, busy?

200
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:09,422
Operator, I'm a soldier.
I'm a wounded man in Korea.

Hello, Adam's Ribs? I'd like
to place a takeout order, please.

206
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:29,638
All right.
Have you got a pencil?

207
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,147
I want twenty pounds... No, make that
forty pounds of your best ribs.

The jumbos.
And I want some barbecue sauce.

Now don't cook 'em.

Good. Okay. Thank you.

214
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,662
- Couldn't have done it
without you, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.

- Oh! Damn it.

- I forgot to order the coleslaw.

Hello?

218
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:17,350
Step one: Spareribs ordered.
Check.

219
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:20,120
Step two:
Ribs must be picked up.

220
00:13:20,194 --> 00:13:23,061
Step three:
Ribs must be paid for.

221
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,759
Step four: Ribs must be flown to us

- <i>Oral sensation.</i>
- You're seeing the real me.

224
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:36,808
As a child, I once ate
twelve banana sandwiches.

225
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:39,243
I slept in the bathroom
for a week.

226
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,747
- Charming.
- Now, Inspector, I figure
that the same person...

227
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:43,749
who picks the ribs up
can pay for them...

228
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,512
and take them
to the airport in Chicago.

229
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:49,352
- Elementary.
- This as-yet-unknown person
gives them to a pilot...

230
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:53,086

Military Air Transport in San Francisco.

- So is your head.

But he went on
to write a great song.

234
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:04,801
You keep this up and the squirrels
are gonna bury your head somewhere.

235

love to do us favors.

a great favor.

Wait a minute, Klinger.
First bones first. Any luck, Radar?

241
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:27,155
Oh, I checked the personnel roster
and all the patients...

242
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,161
and nobody lives in Chicago.

243
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,322
- What a great time to steal it.
- Rats!

244
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:35,664
- Double rats!
- Sir! In the riot you caused
by going off your noodle...

245
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:38,136
you got succotash on my stole!

246
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:41,072
I apologize, Klinger,
from the heart of my bottom.

247
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,234
And liver too, you got on it!

248
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,609
Don't say liver! You say that word again
and I'll set your teeth on fire!

249
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,683
I'll have your skunk cleaned.

250
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,346
Right now, I'm thinking
about bigger things.

251
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:56,753
- Don't you come from Chicago?
- No, he's from Toledo.

252
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:58,849
But I get my lingerie
from Chicago.

253
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:02,123
And it's beautiful.
I hear.

254
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,657
- Do you know anybody in Chicago?
- I got an uncle there.

255
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:09,533
This could be something. Does he
like you? Would he do you a favor?

256
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:12,572
Favor? He'd kill for me.
He'd kill for you.

257
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,937
For $100,
he'd kill for anybody.

258
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:17,670
Why don't you put out
a contract on the spareribs?

259
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:19,713
Would your uncle handle
a package for me?

260
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,647
- Sure, for a price.
- He doesn't have to kill the package.

261
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,241
Just pick it up and deliver it
to the airport in Chicago.

262
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:27,844
It's done.
Won't cost you a dime.

263
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,515
Lady, you're a real gentleman.

264
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:35,358
All you gotta do is sign
my psycho discharge papers...
you and Captain Mclntyre.

265
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,887
Klinger, that paper has to be signed
by three doctors. We're only two.

266
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:42,629
- Nobody else wants to be three.
- Okay. The deal's off!

267
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:46,264
- Wait a second!
- No discharge, no package.

268
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,106
And I expect you to
"un-succotash" my stole, sir!

269
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:54,945
- <i>[Trapper] So emotional.</i>
- Meanwhile, my ribs are sitting there...

270
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:57,279

00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:00,878
- Gee, I wish I could help.

- Would she do you a favor?
- She already did.

278
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,748
She could pick up the ribs. She could
pay for them and put them on a plane.

279
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:22,786
- I'd send her a check.
- You're hallucinating.

322
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,791
- Yeah.
- General MacArthur's personal physician.

323
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,626
MacArthur. Wow. I've never been
in the stockade before.

324
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:50,190
Then wire the, uh, Military Air
Transport Service, A.P.O. San Francisco.

325
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:53,237
- "A.P. O..."
- Tell them that it's urgent.
Critical medical supplies.

326
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:56,068
- "Critical..."
- "Handle with Care. Highly Infectious."

327
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,074
Uh, mark it,
"Quickest possible.

328
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,440
Do not spill.
Keep refrigerated."

329
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,911
Way to go,
"Big John."

330
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:15,288
- Sir. Wake up, sir.
The spareribs are here.
- Where? Where?

331
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,226
They're in a supply depot
down in Ouijongbu.

332
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:20,958
- Uh, they're hung up in channels.
- Who hung 'em?

333
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,557
Well, I talked to a Major Pfiefer.

334
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,262
- He wouldn't even talk
to me when I talked to him.
- What'd he say?

335
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:31,138
He started with, "Drop dead."
And then he got rude!

336
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:35,043
We'll get him, even if
we have to call Klinger's uncle.

337
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:37,877
- Trap? Wake up!
- [Mumbling] Mildred...

338
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:41,214
- Me and the ribs, we're all in Korea!
- Let's eat!

339
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:47,024
Come on, Dan.
It's on the way to Seoul.

340
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,821
No room. I gotta take
this kid down for X ray.

341
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,089
Unless you want to use
the rumble seats.

342
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,723
- Okay! You got it!
- Gimme your hand.

343
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,233
Climb under.
Watch your head.

344
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,235
Okay, get him in.

345
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:25,287
"4077 MASH..."
Oh yes, talked to some...

346
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:27,490
cocky little nurse
at your outfit.

347
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,830
- Radar.
- Tried to muscle me on the phone.

348
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,893
She's a tough little cookie.

349
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,929
There it is. "One box,
medical supplies. Marked urgent."

350
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:39,909
- Figures.
- We're doctors.
We need that stuff, Major.

351
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:43,538
- It's important.
- Yeah, it's a new wonder drug.

352
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:46,816
Top shelf.

353
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:52,950
Keep those code numbers
to the front, so we can read them.

354
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:55,891
Oh, sorry.
It's only our first day on the job.

355
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,225
- What about our package?
- You know what I've got to process?

356
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:04,564
Twelve Sherman tanks, 2,000 blankets,
100,000 rolls of toilet paper.

357
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:08,571
A trainload of semiautomatic
corn poppers and baby A-bomb components.

358
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:12,268
- They're delicious with popcorn.
- Whatever it is, I've got it.

359
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:15,801
And you want me to find
one insignificant little box
of med supplies.

360
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:19,105
We sometimes use them
in our work.

361
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:22,675
You think because
you save lives, it's important.

362
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:24,846
Move this over there.

363
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,857
Sure.

364
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:30,393
- Another box of hernias, huh?
- [Grunting, Sighing]

365
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,453
Major, you're not
gonna cooperate, huh?

366
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:36,625
If I help one person,
I have to help everybody.

367
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:40,068
You can't run a war
on cooperation.

368
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,401
All right, fine.
We'll go up the line.

369
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,566
- Who's your boss?
- My sergeant.

370
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:47,736
- Where is he?
- Look, he's very busy,
and I don't want him upset.

371
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:49,905
We're not gonna upset him.

372
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:52,245
He's over in Admin.
Sergeant Tarola.

373
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,250
Please don't tell him
I sent you.

374
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:56,479
Thank you, Major.
You've been a tower ofJell-O.

375
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,480
Nobody cut
requisition orders on this.

376
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,492
Emergency medical shipment,
Sergeant.

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,994
There's no S-47/19-J accompanying.

378
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:08,691
I told you we should have
got an S-47/19-J accompanying,
but you wouldn't listen!

379
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,758
- That's necessary?
- Necessary?

380
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:17,001
We don't go to latrine around here
without an S-47/19-J. Sorry.

381
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:25,440
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but this little supermarket
of yours isn't all that clean.

382
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:28,815
Yeah. Ideal breeding
environment for cholera.

383
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,081
- The plague.
- You're kidding.

384
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:33,316
Do you always sweat
in 40-degree temperature?

385
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:36,292
- I'm not sweating.
- You should be.

386
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,294
Nothin' wrong with me.
I feel sensational.

387
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:40,853
Ah! There it is.
Say that again, will ya?

388
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,696
I feel sensational?

389
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:47,295
- Definite slurring of the "S."
- Classic early symptom.

390
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:51,102
- <i>Followed by the eyes blinking</i>
<i>in an up-and-down motion.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

391
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,473
You know if there's plague here,
we'll have to close the place.

392
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:55,478
Post it as a contagious area.

393
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,480
- Give you a chance to be reassigned.
- You're probably anxious...

394
00:22:57,548 --> 00:23:00,483
to get up to the fighting war
anyway, aren't you?

395
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,821
[Scoffs]
What's in the package?

396
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,292
Spareribs and sauce from Chicago.

397
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:14,397
- Adam's Ribs?
- You know?

398
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:17,659
I'm from Joliet.
I'd walk to Chicago on my knees...

399
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:19,929
in the snow for a takeout order.

400
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,937
He's one of you.

401
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,236
- How many you got?
- Forty pounds.

402
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:27,401
I'll take twenty
and a quart of sauce.

403
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,513
Ten, and a pint of sauce.

404
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:35,108
Twelve, and a pint and
a half. And coleslaw.

405
00:23:38,121 --> 00:23:40,055
We didn't order any coleslaw.

406
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:45,485
You sent all the way
to Chicago, and no coleslaw?

407
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,864
Forgive us, we're draftees.

408
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,225
##<i>[Wolf Whistle]</i>

409
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:25,125
Shall we give thanks?

410
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,135
Praise the Lord
and pass the sauce.

411
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:29,137
<i>[Man On P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention all personnel. Attention.</i>

412
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:32,538
<i>Ambulances in the lower compound.</i>
<i>Choppers on the upper pad.</i>

413
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:35,305
- <i>[Helicopter Whirring]</i>
- <i>Incoming wounded.</i>
<i>Repeat, incoming wounded.</i>

414
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:37,403
<i>All O.R. Personnel</i>
<i>report on the double.</i>

415
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,710
- Come on!
- <i>[Man On P.A. Repeating]</i>

416
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,615
No! No, that's not fair!

417
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,048
- Come on.
- No, no, wait! It's not fair!
We got ribs now!

418
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:50,524
Adam's Ribs from Chicago!
We lied to Mildred!

419
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:53,153
I had to send her a check!
[Continues, Indistinct]
