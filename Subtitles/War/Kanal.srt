00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,886
1944.
Late September.

8
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,890
The Warsaw Uprising is
nearing its tragic finale.

9
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,893
The towns of Riverside,
Czerniakow and Sadyba

10
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,895
have fallen
long ago.

11
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,897
The downtown areas of
zoliborz and Mokotow,

12
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,900
cut off and surrounded by
German forces, are in flames.

13
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,902
This company
now numbers 43.

14
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,871
Three days ago,
there were 70.

15
00:02:53,907 --> 00:03:00,914
This is their commanding
officer, Lieutenant ''Splinter''.

16
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,873
He recruited these men, and
is responsible forthem.

17
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,925
His second-in-command,
Lieutenant ''Wise'',

18
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,930
drilled discipline into these
boys with an iron hand

19
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,933
And the messenger
girl, Halinka.

20
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,937
Leaving home, she promised
her mother she would keep warm.

21
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,939
They've most likely all made
the same promise.

22
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,942
All mothers
are alike.

23
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,946
Sergeant Major ''Bullet'',
has perfect hand-writing,

24
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,949
and carries all of
the records in his case.

25
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,953
Officer Cadet ''Bearing''
dreams of his daily bath.

26
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,922
But the 3rd Platoon
has biggertroubles.

27
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,961
''Slim'', Bearing's aide,
dreams of building

28
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,929
airplanes after
the war.

29
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,974
And finally, the artist.
He's not a soldier,

30
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,943
and only turned
up yesterday.

31
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,987
These are the
tragic heroes.

32
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,946
Watch them closely, since these
are the last hours of their lives.

33
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,110
Hi, Splinter,you're
right on time.

34
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,146
Were you hit?

35
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,148
A strong wind.

36
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,150
What's the situation?

37
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,153
As you see.
The Stukas came.

38
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,155
The Germans tried to
break through three times.

39
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,157
We're lucky that they
sleep at night.

40
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,160
You won't have a fun time
here, tomorrow.

41
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,163
Maybe a fun death.
We'll try to stay here for a while.

42
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:15,168
l'd like to stay
here, too.

43
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,170
What, until
Judgement Day?

44
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,173
We'll be hailed
by future generations.

45
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,176
They won't
take us alive.

46
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,179
Precisely.
The Polish way.

47
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,182
What's wrong? You've
always been so strong.

48
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,184
l've had enough, understand?

49
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:35,188
What am l supposed to tell
my men? They trust me.

50
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,192
You're losing it.
There's no time to think here.

51
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,195
Bartek almost abandoned
his position today.

52
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,197
As if he had
somewhere to go.

53
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,199
lt's getting
more and more cramped.

54
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,201
They want to finish
Mokotow off,

55
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,203
and get started
on downtown.

56
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,206
Damn, l can't believe it's the
56th day of the Uprising.

57
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,208
lt's hell...

58
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,175
Yes, that's always
an option ...

59
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,226
We know each other.

60
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,229
You gave these to me
on the first day.

61
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,231
Do they fit?

62
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,190
Of course. To think that they
might pull them off my corpse.

63
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,239
But l see you've
joined the Uprising.

64
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,208
What does your mother
think of that?

65
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,247
She's dead.

66
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,250
ls yourwound bad?

67
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,253
No, it's nothing.

68
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,221
lt's too bad that you...

69
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,272
Excuse me, is there a
telephone anywhere nearby?

70
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,274
There will be.

71
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,275
Can l call
Rakowiecka Street?

72
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,277
Are you crazy?
The Germans are there.

73
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,280
l know, but...
l live there.

74
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,282
Please let me call,
all right?

75
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,284
Go see the commander.

76
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,751
That way?

77
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,300
Living in Warsaw must have been nice!

78
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,269
A bourgeois living room.
Absolutely horrible.

79
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,308
We have pistols and
hand grenades,

80
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,309
versus tanks
and airplanes.

81
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,311
When the hell
are we ever going to learn?

82
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,314
Orders are orders.
No sense in rationalizing.

83
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,815
Bearing!

84
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:43,782
Sir?

85
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,318
Post some sentries,
and send out a patrol.

86
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,322
Yes, sir.
l need six volunteers.

87
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,323
Yes, sir!
Yes sir!

88
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,326
l have a special
assignment foryou.

89
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,329
Hold on for a minute.
You're a composer, right?

90
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,330
Yes.

91
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,331
Play something nice,
we have a piano.

92
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,333
But, l ...

93
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,334
Come on ...

94
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,293
Christ, a Bechstein!

95
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,308
Take that goddamned
thing off.

96
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:13,812
La Comparsita would
be much better,

97
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,316
or something like it.

98
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,358
l dreamt of you today,
Halinka.

99
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,362
We were
dancing a tango, and ...

100
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,402
Well?
What's new?

101
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:13,406
Please, Lieutenant.
You promised me a gun.

102
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:17,365
l want to be armed.
Everyone has something ...

103
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,415
That's it?
l was hoping it would be a Luger.

104
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,417
Oh, a Luger? lt would
knock you off yourfeet.

105
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,420
This is perfect foryou.
You can kill from six feet way.

106
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,388
Take it.

107
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:36,391
Stop that noise. Play
something... with some feeling.

108
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:44,437
l could get you a real gun,
instead of that cap gun.

109
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,406
Cap gun? And why
do you keep your antique?

110
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,452
ls everything clear?

111
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,453
Yes, sir!

112
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,421
Don't take unnecessary risks.

113
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:36,489
Can l phone home,
in Rakowiecka?

114
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,492
My family
should be there.

115
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,460
Can l
use that telephone?

116
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,500
Just ask them to connect us
to number40218

117
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,469
All right, hold on.
Let's give it a try.

118
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,507
This is
Splinter. Are you still alive?

119
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,509
You don't have any
window panes?

120
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,511
l've forgotten what
they look like.

121
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,513
You're lucky that
you have a roof.

122
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,517
Listen, can you try
number40218?

123
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,520
No, on the German side.
Rakowiecka.

124
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,522
We want to check if
there's anyone there.

125
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,524
Okay, l'll wait.

126
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,493
They're saying that there's no
one there anymore.

127
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,537
Wanda?
Wanda?

128
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,505
Wanda?
lt's me, Michael.

129
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,543
What's happening
overthere?

130
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,511
l've been looking
foryou...

131
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,516
With the resistance.
l've joined one of the units.

132
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,555
l don't know how,
but it's still going...

133
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,558
What about you?

134
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,025
Evacuating?

135
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,031
Wanda...
My God!

136
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,571
zosia.
zosia.

137
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,539
zosienka, it's me,
Daddy.

138
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,544
zosia.
zosia.

139
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,039
Wanda...
Hallo! Wanda!

140
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,565
Jesus.
They got cut off.

141
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,105
All sentries are
in place, sir.

142
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,406
Thank you.

143
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,608
Slim!

144
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,610
What am l
supposed to do now?

145
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,611
Go and get
some rest.

146
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,613
Everybody get ready
for supper!

147
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,572
Halinka, let's find
a place to sleep.

148
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,678
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, sir!

149
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,682
l don't have any records
of Bearing's platoon.

150
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,686
Don't bother me
with your records.

151
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,688
lt's going to
start soon.

152
00:15:55,688 --> 00:16:00,693
We must keep records, sir.
They're going to depend on them.

153
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,696
They'll depend on them.
That's for sure.

154
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,664
But stop
bothering me now!

155
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,679
Slim! Can you
see anything?

156
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,674
Nothing. The potato-diggers
have just returned.

157
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,423
Only the devil knows
if the potatoes

158
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,187
will do them
any good.

159
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,738
lf they
send any more Stukas,

160
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,740
even the ruins will be destroyed.

161
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,742
Are you ready,
Bearing?

162
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,744
They 'll begin by
eight for sure.

163
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,747
l'm going to shave first.
l have ten ammo clips.

164
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,748
How old are
you, Bearing?

165
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,750
23.

166
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,754
At that age, life
doesn't seem so precious.

167
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,756
You know,
these are the final days.

168
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,214
l know, but we'll make
them bleed first.

169
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,730
ls Daisy
back yet?

170
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,779
What's wrong?

171
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,781
Nothing.

172
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,750
Do you know how
to use that? Careful!

173
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:38,791
Are you crazy?
lt's easy.

174
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,792
Just be careful.

175
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,751
l'm going. The Germans are
finishing their breakfast.

176
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,765
What are you playing?

177
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,270
lt's out of tune.
Too many aspiring musicians here.

178
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,837
l'm going.

179
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,841
Just don't go crazy. lt'd be a
pity to lose an artist.

180
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,809
What do you know?

181
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,860
Oh, sorry.

182
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,861
That's all right.
Come in.

183
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,862
What's this about?

184
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,864
You should get up.

185
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,865
Now's not the time
for lovemaking.

186
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,867
You're speaking
to an officer.

187
00:18:54,867 --> 00:19:02,330
Now is precisely the time
for it. We're in love.

188
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,848
And how's Daisy?

189
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,866
Jacek, l'm here.

190
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,907
l don't stink, do l?

191
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,909
Because l left my shoes
in the hallway.

192
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,911
You should keep out
of those sewers.

193
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,880
You were supposed to
be back by yesterday.

194
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,917
Were you worried
about me?

195
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,919
l stopped worrying
long ago,

196
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,921
but Splinterwas asking
about you.

197
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,923
Are you jealous?

198
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:55,928
Me? Forget it!

199
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,931
You, on the other
hand, spare no one.

200
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,934
l only smiled at Splinter,
and nothing else.

201
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,893
lt looked as if you had
a soft spot for him.

202
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,943
That's just
the way l am.

203
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,946
That's not
a good thing.

204
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,948
You should've stayed
downtown,

205
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,953
with those
friends of yours.

206
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,955
They're going
to finish us.

207
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:23,922
l know.

208
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,963
Look at what
l brought you.

209
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,932
Real English tea,
and cigarettes.

210
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,970
You know l don't smoke?

211
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,973
Where did you
get them, anyway?

212
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,940
From my aunt.

213
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,943
Your aunt...

214
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,982
Jacek, l came back just
foryou.

215
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,941
Me? That's interesting. Why?

216
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,989
Well, why?

217
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,949
Why? Because l'm your messenger.

218
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,455
Did you know that the main
attack will be here?

219
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,972
Stop shaving,
will you.

220
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,976
Wash up, because you stink.

221
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,021
Sun tanning
in the nude?

222
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:33,025
l spent all of July
in zalesie.

223
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,027
l came back to Warsaw
on August 1st.

224
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,029
Only God
knows why...

225
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,998
Did you stay with your
aunt in zalesie, too?

226
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,013
lt's beginning.

227
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,099
Get out of here,
dammit!

228
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,067
Are you crazy?

229
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,120
Keep firing!

230
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,088
Left machine gun,
fire lower!

231
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,609
Look out!

232
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,116
Hello?

233
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:46,158
Hello, Bartek!
Great, both phones are dead!

234
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,160
They're going to come
from behind. zephyr?

235
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,162
Yes, sir!

236
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,165
Go to H.Q.
Explain that we're holding

237
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,166
the red house,
and that the Germans

238
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,167
are near
Bartek's section.

239
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,169
We need a counter attack,

240
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,171
or else they'll cut
us off. Go!

241
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,172
Did you
get all that?

242
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,173
Sure.

243
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,140
Then go!

244
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,187
Junk!
Useless pipe!

245
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,189
They'll get to us
in ten minutes.

246
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,691
Withdraw.

247
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,194
We can't stop them with our bare hands!

248
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,162
God damn!

249
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,169
That's the last
shell, Slim...

250
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,186
Slim actually
hit them!

251
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,186
A Goliath...

252
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,336
Stop that...
l'm all right.

253
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,392
Keep still.

254
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,859
You're not hurt?

255
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,399
l'm glad
you're okay.

256
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,867
What's happening?

257
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,373
What about
the platoon?

258
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,384
What are
the Krauts waiting for?

259
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,889
ls zephyr back?

260
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:12,890
No.

261
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,394
They've surrounded us.

262
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,433
How's Bearing?

263
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,436
He'll live.

264
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,439
They've wasted my men.

265
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,202
Don't get
too sentimental.

266
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,485
The silence is making
my ears ring.

267
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,486
lt's only a short pause.

268
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,488
They're scheming
on how to get us.

269
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,457
The front didn't work,
so they'll try the back.

270
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,859
Now is an easy
time to withdraw, sir.

271
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:30,502
Lieutenant, you never
smoked before. Nerves?

272
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:35,006
Fear. lt's eating
through all of us.

273
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,474
Not me. l've been smoking
since l was a kid.

274
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,991
When did you join
the resistance?

275
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,543
ln July of 1941.

276
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,511
Any decorations?

277
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:18,004
The Cross of Valor
for an attack on Blank...

278
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,556
...for
an attack on Blank Palace.

279
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,559
Wounded in the chest,
in the right side,

280
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,520
on September 26th, 1944.
Any next of kin in case of death?

281
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,543
Thank you.

282
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,560
They've found a way.

283
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,613
l don't understand ...

284
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,615
l've changed my mind.

285
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,617
l won't build planes
afterthe war is over.

286
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,585
Splinter. Splinter!

287
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,589
Game is looking foryou.
Something's happened.

288
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,934
Sir! l report that the
company is in the Red House.

289
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,636
Hello, Splinter.

290
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,639
Leave us, zephyr.

291
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,641
Losses?

292
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,609
12 dead.
10 critically wounded.

293
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,648
You'll be leaving
here at dusk.

294
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,649
We're going downtown.

295
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,651
What? How?
Which way?

296
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,619
Through the sewers.

297
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,657
l'm not going.

298
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,658
Are you crazy?

299
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,660
The are only a few
streets left.

300
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,663
Anyway, they're going to finish
us off by tomorrow.

301
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,666
l'm not going.
All that blood that was shed,

302
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,669
just so that we can
run away like rats?

303
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,638
The sewers?
How can l face my men?

304
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,680
lt's an order, Splinter.

305
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,682
Screw your orders!

306
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,685
You're a damned civilian,
after all.

307
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,653
Don't you want to
rescue your men?

308
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,658
They trusted me.

309
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,698
We all trusted someone.

310
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:51,703
Here... this is your
pass to the sewers.

311
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,670
Take care, Splinter.

312
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,981
Gentlemen, why is it so
quiet in here? For God's sake!

313
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,884
So play a record
on the gramophone.

314
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,695
Stop that.

315
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:20,998
Stop that.

316
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,735
Maybe l should play
an entire symphony.

317
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,703
Here, you can try.

318
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,710
On this thing?

319
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,714
Smart ass...

320
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,761
Listen up, kids.
Good news.

321
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,729
What is it?
Reinforcements?

322
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,724
We're going downtown,
through the sewers.

323
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:03,775
What do you mean?
We're leaving here?

324
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,778
We can't hold Mokotow.
There are only

325
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:13,785
a few streets left.
They'll crush us.

326
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:14,786
Hearthat, guys?

327
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,754
We've been fighting in
this coffin for nothing!

328
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,782
lt's an order
from headquarters.

329
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:04,836
Nothing.
A void.

330
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,304
All l'm doing is making
up hollow sounds.

331
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,809
Don't drink
anymore, please.

332
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,808
l'm impotent, understand?
A pitiful hireling.

333
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,315
That's the real tragedy.

334
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,865
Please, don't drink.

335
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,868
l'm glad this misery
is ending.

336
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,837
Give it to me,
l want some, too.

337
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,884
He loves you, the handsome
trooper, doesn't he?

338
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,852
ls he you first?

339
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,892
l feel like we won't
live through this night.

340
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,861
lt's easierto die
when you're in love.

341
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,866
That's nonsens!
Melodrama!

342
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,873
Don't get carried away.

343
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,912
Make room forthe
company commander!

344
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,914
Drink Splinter.

345
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,917
You've gone mad.
Halinka, haven't you?

346
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,920
l'm not drinking.
l'm listening to music.

347
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,922
Music? So now you all
feel like hearing music?

348
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,924
And you're the one
who's playing?

349
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,926
That's because this will
be the last time!

350
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:38,930
Drink, Splinter. lt'll be easierto
walk through the sewers.

351
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,932
So this is your
sense of discipline?

352
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,936
At your post until the end!
Only dead drunk!

353
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,939
lt's a long way
to downtown.

354
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,942
There's plenty of time
to sober up.

355
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:51,943
What'll we
do downtown?

356
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,911
We'll keep fighting.

357
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,950
Keep fighting? They'll
crush us all like bed bugs.

358
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,952
There's not going to be
anything left of this city.

359
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,921
Shut up! Can't you even
die like a man?

360
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,424
On the contrary. Now l
finally know how to die!

361
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,966
Company roll call.

362
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,299
Yes, sir. But now it's a platoon
and not a company.

363
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,976
Don't anyone even dare
fart once we've started.

364
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,979
Absolute silence, like
in a family tomb.

365
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,983
Otherwise, the Germans
will cut us down.

366
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:38,990
lf anyone is frightened, come
to me, and l'll hold his hand.

367
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,993
Come on,
cheere up!

368
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,961
Attention!

369
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,003
All present and accounted
for, sir, and ready to depart!

370
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,006
Two officers, five N.C.O.'s,
and twenty others.

371
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,008
You're drunk! This is
not the time for drills.

372
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,967
Thank you.
At ease! Forward march!

373
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,027
Can you make it,
Bearing?

374
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,030
l'll go.
Here, give that to me.

375
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,998
Let me try, l'm not
risking much.

376
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,002
He needs
two strong men.

377
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,042
l'll take care of him,
you don't need to worry.

378
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,044
lt's better if you
come with me.

379
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,046
You can show us
the way.

380
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,048
That way is
pretty easy.

381
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,312
Please, let me go
with Bearing.

382
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,351
Wise, give us some
coverfire!

383
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,511
Tigertanks.

384
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,289
This is the
last barricade.

385
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,291
Get in to sewers,
friend.

386
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,294
Lieutenant, may l respectfully
report that it's ourturn...

387
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,296
Report respectfully
into the hole.

388
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,264
Why you little...

389
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,329
Sir, have you seen my
daughter? She's blonde...

390
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,330
Let's go!

391
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,332
Gentlemen, wait!
Please wait!

392
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:25,336
My daughter, blonde,
tall in a brown coat.

393
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:29,295
Please wait!
Gentlemen!

394
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,413
What's happened?

395
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,414
Crap!

396
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,416
Oh, God, the acoustics
are amazing!

397
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,419
''l see a land of heavy
dreams and shadows.''

398
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,921
Stop the chit-chat and
get a move on, Maestro!

399
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,424
Quiet! The orders were, no talking!

400
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,392
l'm too tall for...
Goddamn it.

401
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,897
You're better
off, Halinka.

402
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,408
Gas! Gas!

403
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,452
Wise, let's turn back.
There's gas ahead.

404
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,454
The Germans must be
up there already.

405
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,422
We have to catch up to the company.

406
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,464
Stop!

407
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:37,468
The Germans have released gas!
ls this the way back?

408
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,436
l think so.

409
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,440
Anyway, who knows?
All the sewers look alike!

410
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,484
l'm from Old Town.

411
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,486
l've had enough
of these sewers,

412
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,954
and this stupid game
of hide and seek!

413
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,033
Go back, there's gas!

414
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,536
People, where
are you going?

415
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,504
Guys!

416
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:18,569
My head's spinning.
lt must be the gas.

417
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:23,574
Jacek, it's yourfever.
There's no gas here.

418
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,577
We're never going to
catch up.

419
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,579
Maybe we should
call Michael?

420
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,583
There's no need to,
l know this sewer.

421
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:38,044
lt's not difficult. We'll make
it slowly by ourselves.

422
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,596
Daisy, l'm going to
rest for a minute.

423
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:49,600
Keep going, damn you!
Jacek, keep going.

424
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,568
We'll rest at home.

425
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,573
At home? Does anyone
still have a home?

426
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:08,619
You're really strong, Daisy,
as if you were a laborer

427
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,588
l've never been
a laborer.

428
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,893
You know, l don't know
anything about you.

429
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,599
We fought in the
resistance together.

430
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:28,639
l know that,
Daisy, but...

431
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,097
You want me to tell you
my life story now?

432
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,612
ls it a long story?

433
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,617
Longerthan this sewer.

434
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,615
Keep going.

435
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,640
Jacek!

436
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,648
What's that?

437
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,689
Look ...

438
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,692
ls it a lamp
at the crossing? Or...

439
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,695
Maybe the Germans?

440
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,697
They wouldn't dare
come down here.

441
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,699
Are you sure?

442
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,667
Positive.

443
00:49:55,726 --> 00:50:02,733
Jacek, it's just a normal candle.
This is the first barricade.

444
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,701
You can rest here.

445
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,713
Well help me lift a wounded man!

446
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,722
What are you staring at?

447
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,747
Quiet! You dumb
son of a bitch!

448
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,773
lt's allready seven.

449
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,785
lt's already day up there.

450
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,826
Call Lieutenant Wise.

451
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:39,830
Lieutenant Wise, report
to Lieutenant Splinter.

452
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:46,837
Lieutenant Wise, report
to Lieutenant Splinter.

453
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:51,797
Gas! Gas! Gas!

454
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,847
lt's going to be
extremely difficult

455
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,849
maintaining discipline
here,Lieutenant.

456
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,852
But we have to try and
keep control. What's next?

457
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,821
Let's wait for Wise.
We can't leave them behind.

458
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,876
Damned matches!

459
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,878
lt's not the
matches, sir.

460
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,880
There are so many
feet stirring this crap.

461
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,881
Fumes are being released.

462
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,884
That's what's killing us,
and not the grenades.

463
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:38,889
l used to dabble in chemistry.
Don't you feel weak, Lieutenant?

464
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:39,890
No.

465
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,893
But, there's no
oxygen in the air.

466
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,896
Let's get out
of here, Lieutenant.

467
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:50,901
Well, Lieutenant? Do we let
the men die like this?

468
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,904
ls that my fault?
Why isn't Wise here, yet?

469
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,909
Call him!
Don't sit down!

470
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,868
lt's worst nearthe water!
You won't be able to get up.

471
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:23,697
Let's go, Lieutenant.
We can't stay here.

472
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,893
l'm going to go, then,
to call them.

473
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,998
Lieutenant Wise says that
we should go ahead.

474
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,967
They stopped
so that Bearing could rest.

475
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:37,967
Daisy knows the way.
They'll catch up to us.

476
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,979
Let's go, Lieutenant.

477
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,989
Let's go, guys.

478
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,049
Slow down, Wise.

479
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,050
Faster, faster!

480
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,019
Splinter is probably
out on Aleje Street by now.

481
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,057
Give me the flask.

482
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,059
You're going to get weaker.

483
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,028
Give it to me,
come on!

484
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,079
You want some?

485
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,047
Sure. lt's cold.
l've lost all my strength.

486
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,052
Enough already.

487
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:02,092
lt's the Waters of Lethe.
River of Oblivion.

488
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:06,051
An ordinary homemade brew,
but it makes you feel better.

489
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,067
Did you hearthose sounds?

490
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,110
Come on, Artist,
hurry up!

491
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,113
Christ! What is that?
Wise!

492
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,580
Jesus! Jesus!

493
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,094
Are you okay, Halinka?

494
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,134
Witold! Where are you?
Where's my child?

495
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,136
Shut up! Shut up,
damned woman!

496
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,105
You've sold us out!
Murderers!

497
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:19,169
''There, in the depths of the pit,
as we stand,

498
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:22,172
l see the people in a river of excretion

499
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:30,180
that seems to be the overflow
of the world's toilets.''

500
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,181
What are you talking
about, Michael?

501
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:34,150
Not l, but Dante.

502
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:51,201
Get down here at once!
You'll draw the Germans' attention!

503
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,169
Faster!

504
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,213
Wise. Let's save ourselves!
l'm scared...

505
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,215
Stop whining!

506
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,183
Don't you think l want to
get out of here? Let's go back.

507
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,219
You look bad, Jacek.
You can shave when we're out.

508
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,268
l don't care.

509
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,236
You must be very ill.

510
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,244
What's that?

511
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:19,289
Raining?
That's rain... Quiet.

512
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:23,293
Don't cry, child.
Listen to that .

513
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:30,300
Don't you hear...
Everything 's singing.

514
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,302
Yeah, and maybe you're
seeing angels, also?

515
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,566
Get up! Keep going!
Don't stop!

516
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,275
Hearthat?
Listen!

517
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,313
Nonsense!
lt's just the water!

518
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,317
l can hear it!
Finally, l can hear it!

519
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:51,276
Do you?
l can hear it!

520
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,339
Shut up!
Damn you!

521
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:16,802
What's with you?
Have you lost it?

522
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:35,365
Ridiculous little man.
How could you understand?

523
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,333
Come back!
Don't be an idiot!

524
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,341
Stop, or l'll shoot!

525
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,358
l orderyou to come
back at once!

526
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,396
Wise...

527
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,365
Why am l so weak?

528
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:14,404
We're not going to
reach downtown, anyway.

529
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,407
There's no way.
This damned sewer

530
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:22,367
has to end somewhere!
Let's go.

531
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,394
What is that?

532
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,430
Probably a wounded man.

533
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,898
Could that really
be a human voice?

534
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,437
Let's keep going.

535
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:52,442
Sir, we can't make anything
out of those noises.

536
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,410
l'll go see what it is.
Wait here.

537
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,948
l found your noise-maker.

538
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,510
A man. Let's get out
of here, sir.

539
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,513
l know him. He's a
Colonel from Headquarters.

540
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:07,472
Which one of you
will carry him?

541
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,508
What's the matter?

542
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,023
Forward march!

543
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,581
Where... where is
that sign?

544
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,584
There should be a sign
for Wilcza Street

545
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,586
somewhere to the left.

546
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:20,590
We should have brought Daisy
along . She knows the way.

547
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:25,595
Daisy is helping Bearing,
and we know how to read.

548
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,597
l can't take
this, Lieutenant.

549
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,566
Let get out of here,
orwe might be here forever.

550
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,070
There are no signs.

551
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,609
Call the men, Bullet.

552
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,577
Yes, sir!

553
01:04:56,626 --> 01:05:00,630
Get up!
The Lieutenant is waiting!

554
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,633
Go on ahead.

555
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,635
Wait a few minutes.
l'm feeling weak.

556
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,603
We can rest for a bit.

557
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,633
There!

558
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,645
There should be
a sign here ... Wilcza.

559
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,656
No, there's no sign.

560
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,710
Well?

561
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,713
They're close behind us.

562
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:26,682
Hold on to me, Splinter.

563
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,692
l've had enough of this.

564
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,740
All you have to do
is keep moving your legs.

565
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,743
Daisy ...
aren't you tired?

566
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:57,702
Wh should l be tired?
l'm not wounded.

567
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,753
lt's calm and misty.

568
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:08,758
We're taking a walk through
a dark and fragrant forest.

569
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,727
We're stumbling
through stinking shit.

570
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:19,724
You're always
straight to the point, Daisy.

571
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:28,778
l don't think you could
everfall in love. Could you?

572
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:35,785
Keep moving those
legs of yours,

573
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,788
orwe won't get
there forthree days.

574
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:42,747
You have a fever,
and we'll die of hunger, here.

575
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,801
What's wrong?

576
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,769
Nothing.

577
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:01,777
What's that?

578
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:17,827
He was old. He probably
died during the gas panic.

579
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,818
Stupid people, never been
in the sewers before.

580
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,821
l don't see anything.

581
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,829
There it is, guys!
The sign!

582
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:07,877
l ... love ...
Jacek.

583
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,845
Oh, God.

584
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:46,916
My head's spinning.
l think there's gas in the air.

585
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:50,920
Look at the fog.

586
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,879
You're a child, Jacek.
The fever's making you see things.

587
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:04,889
Wait, this is our sewer.
See it? Wilcza.

588
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:16,912
l wouldn't have
noticed it.

589
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:19,949
l can barely see now.

590
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:23,908
Let's go up there!
Give me your hand.

591
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,965
Your hand ...

592
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,004
Hold on to me!

593
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,973
Jacek!

594
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:28,017
l can't go up that pipe!
l can't reach it.

595
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,985
Daisy, go by yourself.

596
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,991
You idiot!

597
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:41,030
You can't pull me up there, Daisy.

598
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,998
You should go
and get help.

599
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:47,002
l'lljust rest
here and wait.

600
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:56,000
Look there's a sign overthere.
Large letters...

601
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:02,051
l love...

602
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,053
We have to save
the batteries.

603
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:07,022
There's a sign there.
What does it say?

604
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:14,018
l love ... Janek.

605
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,068
Who could have written
such nonsense?

606
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:24,073
lt's not nonsense.
An empty sewer.

607
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:28,077
The Germans high above.
lt's fear, you know?

608
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:32,081
Someone wrote that.
lt made them feel better.

609
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:34,083
l used to pass
though here, too.

610
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,051
And what did you write?

611
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,090
Kiss my ass...

612
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,091
What?

613
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,059
...and otherthings like that.

614
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:51,100
And who's this Janek?

615
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,102
A guy that some girl loved.

616
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:56,105
Loved him a lot?

617
01:12:56,105 --> 01:13:04,113
Yeah, she loved him a lot,
Jacek. Come on, let's go.

618
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:10,119
No, we won't get there, Daisy.
l'lljust wait and rest here.

619
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,122
You'll come back with help,
won't you?

620
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,124
Get up!

621
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:16,091
No.

622
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:29,104
l must have imagined it ...

623
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:38,102
My head is spinning so much.
l even hear music.

624
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:47,111
Must be the fever...
Wait, l can really hear it.

625
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,151
Who was that?

626
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,189
ls he crazy, or am l?

627
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,190
He is!

628
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,191
He's been crazy
for some time now,

629
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,158
don't you remember?

630
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,167
How strange!
l don't remember.

631
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:42,177
Michael.
Michael!

632
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:48,172
Michael!
Come back!

633
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:04,689
Quiet. He can't
hear anything.

634
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:12,196
Jacek, stop this whining,
and let's go!

635
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:21,250
l won't make it up there,
but l want to live.

636
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:26,210
Alright, Jacek,
don't worry, you'll live.

637
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,458
We'll go straight
that way.

638
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:34,225
The sewer should run
into the Vistula pretty soon.

639
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:50,279
lt's dry here. There's got
to be an exit nearby.

640
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,281
Turn on the flashlight.

641
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,283
The battery's
almost dead.

642
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,251
We'll get there anyway.

643
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:08,297
No.
lt's not possible!

644
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,300
l don't have
any strength left.

645
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,303
There's no way we're ever
getting out of here. lt's over.

646
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,305
Over?
What do you mean?

647
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:20,309
lt can't be over!
l have someone to live for!

648
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,312
l'm right here.
Who do you have to live for?

649
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:26,315
What are you talking about?
My wife and my child!

650
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:32,321
Awife and a child? How funny,
you've never mentioned them.

651
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,324
You've neverworn
a wedding ring.

652
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:38,293
What?
l have it on me.

653
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,296
Look!

654
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:47,336
See? l have to live.

655
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,338
Let's go back,
up the sewer.

656
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,341
Hurry up, while l'm
still on my feet.

657
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:54,309
Hold on.

658
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,347
Turn off the light, Wise.

659
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,814
Get up, get up,
get up!

660
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,379
Daisy, l'm going to sit for a bit.

661
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,380
No.

662
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:37,386
l have ...
l have to rest.

663
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,355
Jacek, we'll be at
the river soon.

664
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:49,398
l can't open my eyes.
lt hurts.

665
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:54,403
Then don't.
lt's the fever.

666
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,405
You're going to have
to go to a hospital.

667
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,873
Where's this hospital?

668
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:20,429
Don't you think we'll
get our lives back?

669
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,398
Never.

670
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:31,440
To live, Daisy.

671
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,443
l promised you that.

672
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,445
l was so rude to you ...

673
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,447
We'll talk
about that later.

674
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:43,407
l've been bad.
l was bad.

675
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,435
l see some light
ahead, Jacek.

676
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,457
We're going to live.

677
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,999
Don't open your eyes.
lt's really bright.

678
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,505
ls it much further?

679
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:37,566
l see water, Jacek.
And green grass.

680
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,535
Let's go there, Daisy.

681
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:54,583
You can rest now.
We go to the grass, soon.

682
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:58,041
No, don't open
your eyes because .

683
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:17,370
...because the
sun's come out.

684
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,631
Hands up!

685
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,183
The wedding ring.

686
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,720
Come out! Come out!

687
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:03,772
Slim, throw that damned
gun away.

688
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,775
You're going to kill yourself.

689
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,777
That stunned me...

690
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:13,782
Throw it away.
Let's get some fresh air.

691
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:14,749
Get lost!

692
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:18,787
Light!

693
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,756
Air, sir!

694
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:26,795
We're going to the inlet.

695
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:31,800
Tell the men, Bullet.
The inlet.

696
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,759
We're turning left, guys.
Going to the inlet.

697
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,820
They're coming, Lieutenant.

698
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,789
They're coming.

699
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:12,806
No good.
The exit is blocked.

700
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,817
We're turning back.

701
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:28,857
We've got the strength.

702
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:30,859
l have to get my men out!

703
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:34,818
Sir, we have to get some air.
lt's death back there.

704
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:45,829
They've hung grenades,
dirty bastards! Hold on.

705
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,918
Good.

706
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,927
One more, and we're
on ourway.

707
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,954
Let's go. Let's go, Lieutenant.
Let's go.

708
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,032
Thank you,
Mother of God...

709
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:15,083
Lieutenant,
where are we?

710
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:21,089
Why aren't they coming out?
Call them, Bullet.

711
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:27,050
We're safe. Fresh air,
at last! Let's go away, sir.

712
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,103
Bullet, call them.

713
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:37,105
They could have
walked too far.

714
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:40,108
They stayed behind
a long time ago.

715
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:43,077
l only pretended
they were behind us.

716
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:48,082
You bastard!

717
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,086
And my company?

718
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:56,090
My company's
still in there?

719
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:08,102
My company ...
