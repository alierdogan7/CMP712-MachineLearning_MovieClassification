to accept there might be another way?

1202
02:00:01,694 --> 02:00:04,487
(SHOUTING)
Perhaps their deaths have meaning

1203
02:00:04,572 --> 02:00:08,325
only if we stand together
now and say, "No!"

1204
02:00:10,244 --> 02:00:11,995
No to killing.

1205
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:13,455
No to war.

1206
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:20,879
No to the endless cycle of revenge.
I say no more of it.

1207
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:29,012
(SOFTLY) No more.

1208
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:02,379
ROLAND: "The sunshine on the long,
white road that ribboned down the hill,

1209
02:01:02,463 --> 02:01:06,258
"the velvet clematis that clung
around your windowsill,

1210
02:01:06,842 --> 02:01:09,761
"are waiting for you still.

1211
02:01:09,845 --> 02:01:13,515
"Again the shadowed pool shall break
in dimples at your feet.

1212
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:17,852
"And when the lark sings in your wood,

1213
02:01:18,646 --> 02:01:22,941
"unknowing you may meet
another stranger sweet.

1214
02:01:24,485 --> 02:01:26,403
"It will be better so."

1215
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:46,191
VERA: They'll want to forget you.

1216
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:50,695
They'll want me to forget.

1217
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:58,244
But I can't.

1218
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:02,457
I won't.

1219
02:03:08,422 --> 02:03:10,757
This is my promise to you now.

1220
02:03:14,887 --> 02:03:16,304
All of you.
