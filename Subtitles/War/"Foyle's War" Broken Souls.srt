Come on, Daniel.

DR NOVAK: 'His mental state is
becoming increasingly fragile.

151
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm concerned for him.'

152
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,480
The fracas outside. He was quite out
of control, I understand.

153
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm not familiar with this case.
What happened to this man? Phelps,
is it?

154
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,400
He's with Bomber Command. Some
months ago his plane crash-landed.

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,640
The crew were all burnt to death -
except for him.

156
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,360
Lucky man.

157
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,840
The plane was part of a raid over
Germany which caused a fire-storm
which lasted for two days.

158
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Thousands were killed, and Peter was
a bomb-aimer, by the way.

159
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,320
He did his job well, then.
But a sensitive young man,

160
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,160
with a troubled childhood.

161
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,240
When he was nine, his twin brother
died in a house-fire.

162
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
Fascinating case.

163
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,880
The guilt of the survivor, three
times over.

164
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,720
It would be interesting to talk to
him -

165
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,880
with your permission, of course,
Novak...

166
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,840
But I won't have the time now.

167
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,840
Yes, we must congratulate our
colleague on a promotion.

168
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,720
Dr Worth has just been appointed to
a prestigious position at Cambridge.

169
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,960
Do we need to do anything drastic
about Phelps?

170
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
Is he a danger to himself or anyone
else?

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,280
I don't believe so, but I will keep
a close eye on him, of course.

TYPEWRITER TAPPING

173
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,360
It's very important that he is
watched at all times.

174
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,240
Very well, Doctor.

175
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Joy, are you all right?

176
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,520
It's Peter.
He's getting worse, not better.

177
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,480
Now, listen to me. He is my patient,

178
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,520
under my care and protection,

179
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,760
and I am determined
to help him back to health

180
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
and a normal, happy life,

181
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,560
with you beside him.

182
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,880
Well, it worked.
Apparently.

183
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,760
God help Cambridge.

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,240
You've caused more trouble in six
months than a nest of vipers.

185
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
You must be happy, then.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,320
I will be when you've fulfilled your
side of the bargain.

187
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,800
All in good time, Dr Campbell.
Now, look here...

188
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,840
Ready? Let's get you back to the
Hotel Hitler, then.

189
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,800
You are leaving us so soon?

190
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,480
The university want me to start as
soon as possible.

191
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,720
My congratulations.
I'm sorry to see you go.

192
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,520
No, you're not.

193
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,680
Oh, by the way, those case notes you
borrowed some months ago...

194
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,720
You never returned them.

195
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Oh, yes. Erm...quite interesting.

196
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,960
I'll dig them out.

197
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,200
You'll never guess what I made for
pud. Peach cobbler!

198
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,400
Nice.

199
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,640
It's so strange seeing you sitting
there.

200
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,000
We used to talk about you.
Me and Danny.

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Where you were. What you were doing.

202
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,880
What was it like, Fred?

203
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,680
Tell me.

204
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,200
Leave it, Rose.

205
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,200
If you can't talk to your wife...

206
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,680
(VOMITING)

207
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
The food's too rich. I'm not used to
it.

208
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,880

210
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Well, that's...

211
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,840
..quite ruthless.

212
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,440
I was taught by my uncle, who was as
ruthless with me as with a Grand
Master.

213
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,200
He was champion of Poland, by the
way,

214
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,760
until the Nazis declared chess an
Aryan pursuit, and Jews were banned
from competition.

215
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,960
And of course, that was just the
beginning.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,240
Now, that is excellent.
You are coming along tremendously.

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Chess is splendid - don't you think?

218
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,760
Along with the cinema. It keeps me
sane.

219
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,680
Not your work?
The opposite.

220
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
The enormity of trying to mend so
many lives.

221
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,560
All those broken souls, Mr Foyle.

222
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,680
In the months we've known each
other, played these games,

223
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,520
you've never once
asked about my history, my family.

224
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, I didn't feel I could, without
it being an intrusion.

225
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,240
It is I who must intrude on you.

226
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,360
My wife is a musician, a pianist.

227
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,000
Chopin. I can't listen to him any
more - the associations.

228
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,480
We have a daughter. Marianka.

229
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,560
She will be 14 in a few days,
by the way.

230
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,400
We lived in the old family home in
Lublin.

231
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,880
In September '39 Herr Hitler took
the opportunity of my absence at a
symposium in Paris

232
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,360
to invade my country.

233
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,280
I couldn't get back.

234
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,160
Does that make me a lucky man, Mr
Foyle?

235
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,000
In June '41, my family was forcibly
taken from our home

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,960
and placed in the ghetto.

237
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,800
That much I know. 18 months later I
believe

238
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,000
they were sent to a place called
Majdanek.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,960
The rest is silence.

240
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,240
And so I fear it will remain.

241
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,640
Always hope, wouldn't you say?

242
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,240
You think so?

243
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
We shall see.

244
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
Pupils...should win occasionally -
don't you think?

245
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
I'll kill him!

246
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
I'll kill him!

247
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,560
Excuse me.

248
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,840
(SHRIEKS)
Sorry, sorry. Oh, Fred!

249
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,760
Frostbite. They don't reckon I'll
walk properly again.

250
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,480
Let me see.
No.

251
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,200
I can't.

252
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll...sleep in the spare room.

253
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,600
(HUMMING)

254
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
Dr Worth? (GASPS)

255
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,080
Requisitioned by the Army a few
months ago.

256
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,320
They needed more space for the work
they were doing here.

257
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,040
I was planning on coming here today
to talk to the owners.

258
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,400
The missing boy, Tommy Crooks -
this is where he was evacuated.

259
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,720
Now it looks like I'm going to be
tied up all day.

260
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,720
I know the owners. Sir John and Lady
Muriel. Friends of my uncle.
I could have a word.

261
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,600
All right.

262
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
Letter-opener.

263
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,880
Not premeditated. The killer used
what was to hand.

264
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,520
I wonder if they found what they were
looking for.

265
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,040
Are these all his?

266
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,720
Yes, sir. Dr Worth was about to
leave.

267
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,600
A new job.

268
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,240
Shall we make our own search, sir?

269
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,680
In case the killer didn't find what
he was looking for.

270
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,520
Yeah, and we can take him away.

271
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,840
And nobody in this room for the time
being.

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
I was enjoying that!

278
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,080
What's wrong?
Somebody's coming.

279
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,800
KNOCK AT DOOR

280
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,080
He was a young man in a hurry.

281
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Well qualified and even better
connected.

282
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
I'm sure he would have gone far,
if er...

283
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,840
Were you sorry to see him go?

284
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
With our patient numbers, I'd be
sorry to lose any member of my
staff.

285
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,880
You didn't like him?

286
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,560
What's happened - it's a terrible
thing.

287
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,480
But Dr Worth wasn't a person I
warmed to.

288
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,600
Ambition's one thing. Arrogance
another.

289
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,760
Did he have any enemies here?

290
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,960
I can't say. He wasn't the most
popular member of staff,

291
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,960
but nothing to justify a knife
in the chest.

292
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,680
He's got an article in here - is that
right?

293
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes, and a fine piece of work, I
must admit.

294
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm sure it was instrumental in
getting him his new job.

295
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,240
Is that right?

296
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,800
What about your patients?
Could one of them have got in here?

297
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,760
This isn't an asylum, Sergeant.
We don't lock our patients up.

298
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,880
They may have their difficulties,
but they're neither mad nor bad.

299
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,600
Fred. Are you all right?
Did you sleep well?

300
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,520
Take a while, I reckon.

301
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,400
Along with some other things.

302
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,680
Sorry about last night.

303
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,080
You found your work-clothes, then?

304
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,960
You look so small in them.

305
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,240
I thought I'd go out.

306
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,440
Walk the bounds.
Get a feel for the old place.

307
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
That's nice.

Are you managing all right on your
own?

Dear girl, we're not completely
hopeless!

312
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,720
In a way, it's enjoyable being
without staff.

313
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,600
One feels one is doing one's bit.

314
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,520
Indeed. So, you do remember the boy?

315
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,320
What?
Tommy Crooks.

316
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,000
Oh, he came at the start, Samantha,
with two other lads, but they didn't
last.

317
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,760
Hopeless. One of them was
light-fingered. The other wet the
bed.

318
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,600
Tommy was a nice boy.
Polite, willing.

319
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,560
Knew nothing when he first arrived.

320
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,280
He simply loved mucking out the
animals.

321
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,920
Thought a sheep was a goat! (LAUGHS)

322
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,880
What do they teach them at school?

323
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,200
Yes. And he went back to London
earlier this year?

324
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,520
Didn't want to. Felt at home, see.

325
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,240
We were sorry.
We became fond of him.

326
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,680
Run off, you say?

327
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,720
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

328
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,920
Here? Why should he come here?

329
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,440
Well, if he was happy, and he might
have...

330
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Well, look around...if you don't
believe us.

331
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,080
No, that's quite all right, Sir
John.

332
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm sure he'll turn up.

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,160
This is Dr Worth's article.

344
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,480
I was wondering what there is in it
that upset you so very much last
night.

345
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,080
He used case notes about my
patients.

346
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,160
Confidential observations about
their state of mind and treatment.

347
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,480
I loaned them to him, in good faith.

348
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,360
Mm-hm. I see.

349
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,400
Cos you remember what you said?

350
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,640
(CHUCKLES) I was very angry.

351
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,560
It was a bad thing he did.
A breach of professional trust.

352
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,760
Some might call it theft.

353
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
Oh, you think I would kill a man for
that?

354
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,840
Well...I really don't know.

355
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,160
Mr Foyle, I'm dealing with an urgent
matter.

356
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,400
One of my patients. It won't take
long.

357
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,080
If you could bear with me. Five
minutes. I'll come and find you.

358
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
Of course.

368
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,840
Morning, Dr Novak...

369
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,320
No! What are you doing?

370
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,200
Mind your head.
This is too much! Peter! Peter!

371
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
It's all right, my dear.

372
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,840
Somebody help him! Please!

373
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,680
PETER: No! No!

374
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,040
Now, now, now. Shhh.

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,680
Inside. Inside.

376
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,720
What's happening here?
A patient's being transferred.

377
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,880
A routine matter.
My secretary, Joy Phelps.

378
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,320
Peter's her husband.
Can you excuse us?

379
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,960
Of course. Whose patient is he?

380
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,680
Dr Novak's. I'm surprised he isn't
here to see him off.

381
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,520
Dr Novak's gone, sir. I saw him on
his bicycle.

382
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,280
He looked white as a sheet,
actually.

383
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,880
A bit odd, sir.
Moving a patient, today of all days.

384
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,760
I think we should ask him.

Dr Novak?

00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,760
Rose!
I brought your dinner.

400
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,880
I can't let you eat in the kitchen
any more. I'm sorry. Fred...

401
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,800
Please, no.
You have been so good to me.

402
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,800
What are you playing at?

403
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,720
I just brought Johann some dinner.

404
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,960
You're not...
Fred, please.

405
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,680
Don't you realise how his lot
treated me for five years?

406
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,120
The muck they fed us?
You don't know the half.

407
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,040
He's not stopped all day.

408
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,520
And you give him egg and chips and
all the trimmings. I wonder what
else!

409
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,440
What do you mean?

410
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,040
Here. You can have the bread.

411
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,200
(GROANS) Could you not just let me
go?

412
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,600
Why have you done this?
It was what he said. Werth...

413
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,400
What's that?

414
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,080
Werth. What he said.

415
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,520
MAN: I want to see my son.
And I tell you he's not here.

416
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Don't give me that. I know he is.
Where else would he go, eh?

417
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,600
Now, listen to me, my man. It would
be better for you if you left now.

418
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,160
I'm not your man, and you can't tell
me where to go.

419
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,120
What is it, darling? Who are you?
Oh, this fella...

420
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,000
You know who I am.
I've been down here a few times...

421
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,480
You're the father of the Crooks boy.
That's right.

422
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,960
And I've come to take him home,
where he belongs.

423
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,000
It's loaded.

424
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,680
What are you doing, you potty old
fool?

425
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,560
Defending my property.
Now, get out of here.

426
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,320
You're finished, you and your kind.

427
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,480
You wait till the war's over!

428
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,240
You won't be running this country no
more. You mark my words.

429
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,160
Oh, don't be absurd!

431
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,080
Excuse me. May I come in?

432
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,960
I wish to speak with you.

433
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,040
What do you want?

434
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,440
You are angry with me,
because of my country,

435
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,400
and what happened to you there.

436
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,680
Say what you have to say and go.
It does not matter for me.

437
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,080
But for Rose, to make her so
unhappy, it is not so good.

438
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,680
Don't you tell me...

439
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,600
You are home again.

440
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,760
I know nothing of my family -

441
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,680
if they are alive or dead.

442
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,800
You are a lucky man.

443
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,040
To have a beautiful wife and such a
fine son.

444
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,920
I wish...

445
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,520
I went to the war, like you.

446
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:26,320
Gave up my life. Lost my friends.
Saw bad things. Got locked up.

447
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,240
You see, we are not so different.

448
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,440
Just soldiers.

449
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,640
What a failure.
I could not even kill myself.

450
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm surprised they let you home.
No sympathy for civilians,

451
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,680
foreigners and would-be suicides.

452
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,280
And they needed the bed
for more-deserving cases.

453
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,800
Look, at some point I'm going to have
to ask for your help.

454
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,920
Do you feel all right now, or shall I
come back?

455
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,800
What would you like to know?

456
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,680
I'd like to know why you had Peter
Phelps moved.

457
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,560
I was unable to help him.
Another failure.

458
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,440
Was he your patient?
Yes.

459
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,560
And where did you move him to?

460
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,960
I had him committed to a mental
asylum.

461
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,240
Impossible to overlook that you chose
to move him within hours of Dr
Worth's death.

462
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,120
Coincidence. It does happen.

463
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,080
What did Dr Worth say to you?

464
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,160
As they were taking you to the
hospital, you tried to tell me what
he'd said to you.

465
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,040
Did I? I can't remember.

466
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Of course, it's also impossible to
overlook the fact

467
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,600
that you've attempted to kill
yourself within hours of telling me
you were going to kill Dr Worth.

468
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,720
Did you?

469
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,320
It wasn't that he lied to me,
cheated me.

470
00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:00,720
Rather, that he used the misery of
brave and damaged men to better
himself.

471
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,280
I'm so tired.

472
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
The bestiality of violence, and the
horror, the horror.

473
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,160
I don't want to be part of your
brave new world.

474
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,080
Aren't you going to arrest me?

475
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,440
Not just yet.

476
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
Then I'd like to go back to work as
soon as possible.

477
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,000
I can help.

478
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,680
This is very good of you.

479
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,720
My pleasure. We had a report about a
young boy who's run away from home.

480
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,160
We think he might be hiding down
here somewhere.

481
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,880
I was wondering what would make a
child do that.

482
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,320
Unhappiness at home, perhaps.
Or school.

483
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh, I think he's left school.

484
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,360
He delivers telegrams for the Post
Office.

485
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,880
I suppose that, every day, he
delivers one of "those" telegrams.

486
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,720
Your missing boy.

487
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,640
Telling a mother or a wife

488
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,160
their son or husband is dead.

489
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,680
The pain he must see...
How old is he?

490
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
15.

491
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
He was evacuated here at the start
of the war.

492
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,760
Really?

493
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,720
(SIGHS) What a burden. Poor child.

494
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,600
He is a messenger of death.

495
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
You don't think Dr Novak killed
Worth, do you, sir?

496
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,480
Did I say that?

497
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,880
So, shall I go on interviewing
Worth's colleagues and patients?

498
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Yep.
Despite what Dr Novak said?

499
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,280
Yeah. You can also speak to Mrs
Phelps and find out where they've
taken her husband

500
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,040
and as much as you can about him.

501
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,920
Yes, sir.

502
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,680
Dr Novak does seem to be a decent
man, sir.

503
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,280
Decent men don't kill?

504
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,520
Not usually.

505
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,400
Well, quite.

506
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,360
When Peter had his breakdown and was
sent here, I came down to be near
him.

507
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
I had to find a job.

508
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,600
Dr Campbell was looking for a
secretary, so...

509
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,920
Good for everyone.

510
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,000
Iain - Dr Campbell - he's been very
kind.

511
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,200
A draft of the staff newsletter.
Perhaps you could tidy it up.

512
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,000
I understand that your husband's
condition has worsened recently.

513
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,600
He's become more...difficult.

514
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,520
Short-tempered.

515
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,240
I can't seem to reach him, get
through to him, let alone help him.

516
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,160
Isn't it awful? His own wife.

517
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,080
'm sorry.

518
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,400
Was your husband ever violent
towards you?

519
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,520
No, no.

520
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,920
Well, at least, only in words.

521
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,080
It was Dr Novak's view that Peter
was losing control somewhat

522
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,920
and it was better that he be cared
for in a more appropriate place.

523
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,680
An asylum?
I agreed.

524
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,680
It's not such a bad place.

525
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,720
I'll get you the details.

526
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,200
You look at the fixtures, tell me
what you think the results will be,

527
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,760
I'll fill out the coupon in the
paper, and Robert's your father's
brother.

528
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,160
But what's the point?
The point, Sam, is:

529
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,960
you might win something sizable for
your bottom drawer.

530
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,080
I haven't got any drawers, bottom or
otherwise.

531
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
(BOTH LAUGH)

532
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,920
What have I missed?
Nothing, sir.

533
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,720
In fact, you're just in time - to
hand over a tenner.

534
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
What's that for?
Football pools, sir.

535
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,760
Right. That's really where my money
should be going? There's a war on.

536
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,640
Well, it's nearly over, Mr Foyle.

537
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,400
Call it an exercise in staff morale,
with the station closing.

538
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,840
Right.

539
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,640
Leaving?
Yeah.

540
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,520
How did you get on?
I spoke to Mrs Phelps.

541
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,040
She's very cut up about her husband
being put away.

542
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,360
Is this where he is?

543
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,200
Yes, sir. But she looked almost
guilty about it.

544
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,840
I rather got the impression that
there might be something between her
and Dr Campbell.

545
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Ah. How does that help, I wonder?

546
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,360
Come on, Milner. Put your hand in
your pocket.

547
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,880
Oh...did you see all the moths
flying out?

548
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,200
(CHUCKLES)

549
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,080
Thank you.

550
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,880
When you've quite finished...I want
to make a complaint.

551
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,440
Look, I just want to know he's safe.
I know he come running back up here.

552
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,960
That's why I went to see the landed
gentry.

553
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,280
And caused a right old to-do, by the
sound of it.

554
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,840
He was the one with the shotgun!
I want him charged, by the way.
Threatening behaviour.

555
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,480
What happened, before Tommy ran
away?

556
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,560
We had words.

557
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,320
He was supposed to bring in
something for tea, but he forgot, so
I had a go at him.

558
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,400
He started creating, and...I gave
him a wallop.

559
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,880
I wish I hadn't, but...I did.

560
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,600
I keep thinking he's just away at
the market, or in Hastings.

561
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
He'll be back soon.

562
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,200
It wore him out, son -
running the place on his own.

563
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,560
Got too much for him.

564
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,520
And I wasn't here.
You were doing your bit.

565
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,240
He was proud of you.

566
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,960
Nothing to be proud of.

567
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,840
Second day in action, they took me.

568
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,760
Didn't even get to kill one of the
bastards.

569
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,320
You come for him, then?
Yeah.

570
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,640
I'll er...walk back with you.

571
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,680
Rose!

572
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,640
I made you a rabbit pie.

573
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,520
And a plum cake.

574
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,000
What is this?

575
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,240
I made it for Fred coming home, but
it's too big for him now.

576
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,280
I want you to have it.

577
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,680
Rose...

578
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,760
I'll write to the Agricultural
Committee.

579
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,000
They'll talk to the camp commander
and find you another place.

580
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,720
Please, look at me.

581
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,320
You're sending me away?

582
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,120
I don't know what we're going to do,
but you can't stay, and that's a
fact.

583
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,440
Rose, I...
Don't.

584
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,960
Please.

585
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,560

Everything will be OK.

586
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,200

587
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,040
I'll miss you too, Johann.

588
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,760

Oi, you! Get your hands off her!

603

take it out on him, so you belt your
wife, instead.

This woman in Bethnal Green -
I took her a telegram.

631
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,080
Found her in the back yard, beating
this old rug on the washing line.

She looks at it, hands it back and
asks me to read it for her.

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,640
Did what he was told. Got on with his
work.

685
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,520
I wish they were all like him.

686
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,440
Why do you think he cleared off?

687
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,320
I...don't rightly know.

688
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,480
He's not daft enough to try getting
back to Germany, is he?

689
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,760
Do his bit, now their backs are
against the wall?

690
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,200
Oh, what's he gonna do?
Swim the Channel?

691
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,080
Doesn't make sense, does it?

692
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,960
Anyway, he's not that kind of lad.

693
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,240
No Nazi, you mean?
Well, he said he hates soldiering.

694
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,120
He's a farm boy. Likes animals.

695
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,760
Was he his usual self yesterday
afternoon?

696
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,600
Nothing out of the ordinary?
Just a normal day.

697
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,760
Took him to the farm in the morning,
brought him back in the evening.

698
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,040
And everything was all right?
Yeah. I don't understand it.

699
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,760
I mean, I think he was happy here.
You know?

700
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,080
Damn and blast! There's got to be a
few here somewhere.

701
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,280
Ah!

702
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,200
Oh...

703
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,920
Are you spying on me, girl?

704
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,000
Couldn't Tommy do that for you, Sir
John?

705
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,520
I know he's here.

706
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,320
No, he's not.

707
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,960
He was seen. Someone spoke to him
not far from here.

708
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,000
You misunderstand me.

709
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,280
He was here, but he is no longer.

710
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,200
I don't understand.
He went out fishing.

711
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,280
Something for the supper.

712
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,080
He never came home.
We haven't seen him since.

hoping he's going to come through

Be careful, Daniel. It's dangerous.

What's that, Mummy?
What?

00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,680
Down there - look.

00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,480
That's him.

725
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,440
Sir, there's something on the back
of the head. A wound.

726
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,040
How's that happened, do you think?

727
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,840
Well, he could have fallen.

00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,560
Or he was hit.

He is a German, after all.
That's enough motive for some.

I wouldn't normally, but under the
circumstances,

751
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,440
I feel I ought to tell you.

752

Mrs Dawson spent the night with me
last night.

She turned up at my doorstep, very
upset.

She and her husband had an argument
about Johann Schultz.

755
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,760
I see.

756
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,840
So, he left here at the usual time
yesterday?

757
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,120
Yes.
That was the last you saw of him?

758
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:00,240
Because where his body was found
suggests that he was either on his
way here or...

coming back from here.

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,800
But erm...you couldn't confirm that?

No.

762
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,840
But I gather you weren't here last
night.

763
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,120
I stayed with Sam.

764
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,560
Any particular reason for that?

765
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,240
I had some shopping to do in town.
I didn't want to cycle back in the
blackout.

766
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,200
Hmm.

767
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,720
What about you, Mr Dawson?
What about me?

768
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,600
Were you here last night?

769
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah. I was here all night.

770
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,120
I had a bit to drink. I fell asleep.

771
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,880
I didn't see him.

772
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,040
How difficult was it, coming back
home, after five years in a
prisoner-of-war camp,

773
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,880
to find a German working on your
farm?

774
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,440
Well, he did his job.

775
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:05,000
Impossible not to understand
whatever resentment you might have
felt, in the circumstances.

776
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,880
So, I didn't like him.

777
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,920
Not a crime, is it?

778
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,200
We're fighting the bastards, for
God's sake.

779
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,000
But I didn't kill him, if that's
what you're thinking.

How did YOU get on with him?

781
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,320
He was a lovely boy.

782

I'm so sad he's dead.

783
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,680
I don't know how I'm going to
explain it to my son. He adored him.

01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,120

that place - it's unbearable to me.

You know that.

Excuse me. I should have knocked.

01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,000
I'll come back.

01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,440

Have you?

792
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,320
How is he?

793
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,200
He's in a very bad way.

794
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,920
Joy...

795
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,440
Mrs Phelps is under great strain.
She needs a great deal of support.

796
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,320
Yeah, I can see.

797
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,000
How's er...Dr Novak, by the way,
since he's been back at work?

798
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,200
I wanted him to take more time off.

799
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,080
I'm concerned about him.

800
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,280
What do you make of him claiming
responsibility for Dr Worth's death?

801
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,520

But who knows what men are capable
of when pushed to the limit?

804
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,000
It may seem a truism, Mr Foyle,

805
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,440
but all of mankind's most
impenetrable secrets lie inside the
head.

808
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,080
You don't look very well.

809
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,920
Do you know what is definition of a
psychiatrist?

810
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,640
A person trained at length and great
expense to help other persons go
mad.

811
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,800
Perhaps I shouldn't be asking for
your help, then.

812
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,560
In spite of you having seen him, the
boy seems to have gone missing again.

813
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,920
Odd. Why should he do that?

814
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,560
And it seems that...you were the
last to see him.

815
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,280
How was he?

816
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,960
Calm. We had a good talk. There was
a distressing incident at work.
That's why he ran away.

817
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,840
And where did you see him?
At the pond, fishing, quite happily.

818
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,960
I should also mention that I've been
to see Peter Phelps.

819
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,240
I've told you who killed that shabby
little man, Worth.

820
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,080
Yes, well...I'd say you didn't have
it in you to kill.

821
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:38,360
I think you're allowing friendship
to interfere with the prosecution of
your job.

822
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,200
It never has before.

823
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,960
I'd also say you're ignoring the
lessons of recent history.

824
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,800
Think of all those men who led such
unremarkable lives till '39.

825
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,960
We gave them a uniform, a gun and a
mandate.

826
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,200
Kill, we said. And they have,
unblinkingly, in vast numbers.

827
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,040
Mr Foyle, I sent off the coupon.
Excellent. What coupon's that?

828
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,720
From the paper. The football pools.
The War Cup. They're playing
tomorrow.

829
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,160
Wonderful.
I must say,

830
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,040
I had to laugh when I saw your line.

831
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,720
Well, I filled it in solely with your
amusement in mind(!)

832
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,440
Port Vale have as much chance of
getting a draw at Arsenal

833
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,720
as I have of winning the Derby on a
seaside donkey.

834
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,320
Right.
My! What system did you use, sir?

835
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,400
I used the random system, Sergeant.

836
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
But you can't do that, sir.

837
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,160
No, you have to look at the teams,
work out which is better and how,
and decide. That's how you win.

838
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,400
Well, science was never my strong
point.

839
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,800
Well, we'll see which comes out on
top, shall we, sir? Science or
chance.

840
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,280
We will.

841
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,800
Sir, we've had the MO's report on
Johann Schultz.

842
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,640
Ah, right.

843
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,520
Port Vale - what a lovely name.
It sounds such a peaceful place.

844
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,680
Where is it, exactly?

845
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,560
Somewhere up north.

846
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,680
He can't say exactly what caused the
head injury.

847
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,200
There were fragments of stone in the
wound,

848
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,960
but whether they're the result of a
fall or a blow, he can't say.

849
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,200
Mm-hm.
But he did find something else.

850
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,000
There was no water in his lungs.
He didn't drown.

851
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,200
He was dead before he went into the
lake.

852
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,560
Right.

853
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,000
Someone killed him?

854
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,200
Looks like it, yes.

855
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,080
Jesus! That's...

856
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,000
I need a smoke.

857
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,440
You liked him, didn't you?

858
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,960
Bloody hell.

859
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,240
What happened between Fred Dawson
and Johann yesterday?

860
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,480
Nothing happened.

861
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,080
He thought there was something going
on between Johann and Rose.

862
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,480
Yesterday afternoon, it all blew up.
Bit of a fight. Nothing much.

863
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:48,360
Fred was no match for Johann.
I took him away.

864
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,440
Fred and Rose had things to sort
out.

865
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,560
When Johann escaped, do you think it
was to go back to Down End Farm?

866
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,560
I don't know.
Maybe he was worried about Rose.

867
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,280
She was...kind to him.

868
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,920
Fred - very angry yesterday?

869
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,120
A bit.

870
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,960
How angry?

871
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,240
Look, it's not going to be me that
puts the noose round Fred's neck.

872
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,160
Just for killing a Jerry.

873
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,520
But if he'd done or said anything he
perhaps shouldn't have,

874
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,440
you'd tell us, wouldn't you?

875
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,880
Of course.
And you'd tell us because,

876
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,920
German or not, whether you liked him
or not,

877
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,160
this man's been beaten to death and
that's wrong. You'd agree?

878
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,360
Yes.

879
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,000
How angry?

880
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,360
He said, if he ever came back to the
farm again, he'd kill him.

881
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,320
There. I've said it.

882
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,120
God forgive me.

883
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,720
I'm under arrest?

884
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,240
There are questions you need to
answer about the death of Johann
Schultz.

885
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh, Fred...

886
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,880
Please, if you'll come with us.

887
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,320
(DOG BARKING)

888
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,760
Oh, Sam...

889
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,960
I know.

890
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,880
It's going to be all right, Rose.

891
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,000
What if he did it?

892
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm telling you - I never saw him
again.

893
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,600
I downed half a bottle of Scotch and
passed out. I didn't wake till dawn.

894
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,960
Well, that's fine, except that nobody
can vouch for it - you were on your
own.

895
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,200
Yes.

896
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,840
What can be vouched for is your
attack on Mr Schultz...

897
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,000
No, that's...
..the reason for your attack...

898
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,720
I was angry - I admit that.

899
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,160
..and your threat to kill Mr Schultz
if he came back.

900
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,320
I didn't mean it!
So, on the face of it,

901
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,440
it looks to us as if that's what
happened.

902
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,240
I didn't mean it. It was just one of
those things you say!

903
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,120
It was just one of those things you
say.

904
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,680
I didn't kill him.

905
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,680
And if he came back, I didn't see
him.

906
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,360
Sergeant, look after Mr Dawson in
there, would you, for a moment?

907
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,240
Sir.

908
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,600
RADIO: 'We now bring you a further
dispatch from our Moscow
correspondent, Alexander Werth,

909
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,160
who was with the Red Army when it
liberated the Nazi concentration
camp at Majdanek in Eastern Poland.'

910
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,600
'Nothing in my experience could have
prepared me

911
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:50,040
for the image that greeted us on our
arrival earlier today.

912
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,720
Row upon row of drab huts,
containing horrors that defy
imagination,

913
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,960
that were nevertheless arranged in
front of us like some scene from
hell...'

914
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,400
I just wondered if there was any
news on my lad.

915
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,400
He was staying with the old couple,
after all, but he's gone.

916
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,480
Well, where's he gone?

917
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,200
You haven't seen him?
No.

918
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,800
Well, if he's not with you, and he's
not with them...

919
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,240
Run off again?

920
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,880
I don't know what's wrong with that
lad. I mean, I don't know what to
say to him.

921
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,160
Jeannie would have got through to
him. She was good at that.

922
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,360
Your wife? She's passed away?

923
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,640
Last July. Just after Tommy came
home.

924
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,880
She was in a baker's on the
Commercial Road, getting a loaf for
his sandwiches.

925
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,160
Doodlebug.
Killed everyone in the place.

926
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,920
I'm sorry.

927
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,120
Tommy was the first one there.

928
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,040
You know, what he must have seen,
it don't bear thinking about.

929
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,840
But he never cried.

930
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,000
He always said he didn't want the
war to end, so he could join up and
get his own back.

931
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,280
Revenge, you mean?
Oh, yeah. Hates them, he does.

932
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,000
I don't know what he'd do if he met
a Jerry in the street.

933
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,920
We know that Tommy was out and about
the day that Schultz escaped.

934
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,440
Dr Novak saw him barely half a mile
from the lake,

935
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,720
so it gives him an opportunity, as
well as a motive.

936
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,280
And how old is he?

937
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,760
He's 15, but he's a big lad for his
age.

938
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,240
And now he's disappeared.

939
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,360
At first I thought it was a
coincidence, but now I'm not so
sure.

940
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,400
Well, the sooner we find him the
better.

941
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,160
TELEPHONE RINGS
Will you get that?

942
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,360
Hello?

943
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,520
Yes.

944
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,400
Yes, he's here.

945
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,720
It's the gentleman from the BBC you
were after, sir.

946
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,720
Good afternoon. May I speak to the
manager, please?

947
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,600
Yes, of course.

948
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,880
He's gone to the pictures?

949
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,240
Yeah, I'm sure there's method in his
madness.

950
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,160
I wonder what's on.

951
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,920
Sir?

952
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,960
All right.

953
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,400
Sir, how long do you think you're
going to be?

954
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,040
About an hour.

955
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,280
Last look around, before we hand
back the keys.

956
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,200
Well, I was thinking about Tommy.

957
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,240
If I was in trouble, where would I
hide?

958
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,240
And he lived here for four years.
Had the run of the place.

959
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,400
He knew it better than anybody.

960
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,120
I was wondering: could I take a
look?

961
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,040
Do.

962
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,520
And nobody's been in here - right?

963
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,960
No, sir, apart from me and one of
our men, when we were doing the
search.

964
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,840
Find anything?
Not really.

965
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,600
Ah...you're back.
Have you finished in here yet?

966
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,240
Almost.
Good.

967
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,120
We're desperately short of space.

968
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,000
Mm-hm.

969
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,840
What does "not really" mean?

970
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,920
There's a copy of a letter.

971
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,120
A reference from Dr Campbell in
support of Worth's job application.

972
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,080
It doesn't quite tally with what
Campbell said about him.

973
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,760
Perhaps he was just desperate to get
rid of him.

974
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,000
Is that it?
Yes, sir.

975
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,840
We've been through all the packing
cases.

976
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,720
His desk, the rest of the furniture.

977
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,680
Pictures off the walls, rugs off the
floor. Up the chimney.

978
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,840
The only thing we haven't done is
lift the floorboards.

979
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,880
Maybe the murderer found what he was
looking for, after all.

980
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,640
Where do...

981
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,680
"..all of mankind's impenetrable
secrets" lie, Milner?

982
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,440
Sorry, sir?

983
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,200
Ah, sir. We've finished with Dr
Worth's study.

984
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,920
Ah, good.

985
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,800
Compliments of DCS Foyle.

986
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,720
Thank you.

987
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,680
DOOR CREAKING

988
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,800
Hello?

989
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,280
Tommy, is that you?

990
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,640
CLATTERING

991
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,640
Stay away.

992
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,960
Are you all right?
Leave me alone.

993
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,880
Look, I'm here to help you.

994
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,040
Sam?

995
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,920
Please, Tommy.

996
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,440
No-one's going to hurt you.

997
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,440
Why did you run away, Tommy?

998
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,320
I'm saying nothing.

999
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,680
You met the German, didn't you?

1000
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,520
By the lake. Were you thinking about
what happened to your mum?

1001
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,440
No! Don't come any closer.

1002
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,760
Careful.
I'll jump! I'm not scared.

1003
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,040
Looking for this?

1004
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,480
Tell us what happened, Tommy.
I promise you it'll be for the best.

1005
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,360
We know you didn't kill that man.

1006
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,920
But you must have seen something.

1007
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,880
I was trying my luck at the lake.
I got nothing in the pond.

1008
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,320
Go on.

1009
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,320
Two men - I heard them talking on
the path above the lake.

1010
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,920
Then him - the one who fell - he
walked on.

1011
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,200
But the other man picks something up
and he runs after the other bloke

1012
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,000
and he hit him over the head, like
really hard, like this.

1013
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,280
And then... Did you say his name was
Johann?

1014
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,600
Was he really a Jerry?
He was a prisoner of war.

1015
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,800
See, I never knew that.

1016
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,520
That he was German.

1017
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,680
Then what happened?

1018
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,480
He fell down.

1019
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,920
The other man bent down to look at
him,

1020
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,160
and he put his head in his hands,
like this.

1021
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,040
Then he rolled him into the lake.

1022
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,240
Not 20 yards away from where I was
standing.

1023
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,400
Who was it, Tommy?

1024
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,320
Who killed Johann?

1025
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,240
"Affair" makes it sound so grubby.

1026
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,240
And that's not how it was.

1027
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,040
But Worth was a nasty little shit.

1028
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,160
He said something to me about Joy.

1029
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:08,360
A lewd remark. I snapped at him.

1030
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,880
And he laughed.

1031
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,760
He knew.

1032
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,720
And I made the mistake of writing to
Joy.

1033
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,400
An affectionate letter.

1034
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,000
I put it in the post-tray in the
staff sitting room.

1035
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,000
Worth took it, and he used it.

1036
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,880
If it ever got out - the wife of a
patient -

1037
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,840
I'd have been ruined.

1038
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,720
And poor Joy...

1039
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,080
He forced me to write a glowing
reference for his job application.

1040
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,280
I did it on condition I got the
letter back.

1041
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,240
And he broke his word.
He said he'd keep it as insurance.

1042
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,960
And he smiled.

1043
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,680
He never should have smiled.

1044
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,920
Iain...

1045
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,280
Oh, I'm sorry...Mr Foyle.

1046
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,760
I must make it clear that Joy knows
nothing of this.

1047
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,720
She thinks her husband killed Worth.

1048
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,840
What is it? What's... Is everything
all right? What's going on?

1049
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,840
Mr Foyle.
Thank you.

1050
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,880
SWING BAND ON RADIO

1051
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,160
Are you ready to order?

1052
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,040
Could I have a cup of tea, please?

1053
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,760
You're quiet today, even by your
standards.

1054
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,000
Well, I know I've got to make a
better show of this than I did last
time. Check.

1055
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,440
I'm...surprised you have the time,
given everything that's on your
plate.

1056
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,440
Glad, of course, but...

1057
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,360
And I'm also wondering how I'm going
to tell you.

1058
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,640
Tell me what?
Well, firstly...

1059
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,160
..we now know who killed Dr Worth.

1060
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,520
And I'm relieved to be able
to tell you that it wasn't you.

1061
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,960
Wasn't it?

1062
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,000
Though I do now perhaps understand
why it is that you tried to take the
blame.

1063
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,640
It was Peter, wasn't it?

1064
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,760
Well, I'd be very interested to hear
why you're so convinced it was.

1065
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,080
Because when I went to Worth's study
that night, Peter was there.

1066
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,280
'Kneeling over the corpse. Blood on
his hands. Completely gone.

1067
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,400
What was he doing there?'

1068
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,920
I felt desperate that I hadn't been
able to help him, that it was my
fault.

1069
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,800
Of course it was Peter.

1070
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,480
It was Campbell.

1071
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,320
But why? I don't understand.

1072
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,760
Worth was blackmailing him because of
his relationship with Peter's wife.

1073
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,160
But this, none of this -

1074
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:26,520
Worth's murder or your belief that
Peter was responsible for it -

1075
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,240
is the reason why you tried to take
your own life, is it?

1076
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,080
And it wasn't until today that I
realised

1077
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,440
that it wasn't even
what DOCTOR Worth had said to you...

1078
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,120
It was what he said. Werth.
What's that?

1079
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,400
..but what the BBC correspondent,
Alexander Werth,

1080
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,880
had said in his report from Majdanek,

1081
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,120
first broadcast, according to the
BBC, the morning I came to see you in
your office,

1082
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:58,000
describing the unimaginable horror
that had been uncovered there.

1083
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,440
No, the point is, someone did
imagine it and then made it a
reality -

1084
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,560
for my family, amongst countless
others.

1085
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,720
I was wrong to try to take my life.

1086
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,280
We must carry on, however bleak the
future seems, however impossible it
is to face it.

1087
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:23,000
And I was wrong to take the blame
for Worth's death.

1088
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,880
But when I came to myself in
hospital...

1089
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,760
..it seemed I had betrayed my
murdered family.

1090
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,000
I was alive and they were dead.

1091
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,960
It was the guilt of the survivor,

1092
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,320
and I had to take the blame for
something.

1093
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,240
I had to find a reason for my
existence.

1094
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,040
(TEARFULLY) And if I could help
Peter in any way,

1095
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,880
help give him time to recover...

1096
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,080
I'm sorry.

1097
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,120
I had news today.

1098
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,240
From my contacts in Poland.

1099
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:06,280
There were very few survivors in
Majdanek, but...

1100
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,760
..among them, it seems,

1101
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,640
my daughter Marianka...

1102
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,040
It seems she is alive.

1103
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,760
I'm very pleased to hear it.

1104
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,200
You have been a good friend to me,
Christopher,

1105
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,080
at a most difficult time in my life.

1106
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,200
Well, the occasional game of chess,
Josef - it's not very much.

1107
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,080
You listen. You understand.

1108
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,680
I am so grateful.

1109
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,200
But I think I have taught you too
well.

1110
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,520
You have beaten me here for the
first time!

1111
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,800
If you'll excuse me, I think I
should get back to work.

1112
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,840
And secondly...

1113
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,760
How was the film the other night?

1114
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,960
Bing Crosby? Oh!

1115
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,240
Silly and sentimental and quite
wonderful.

1116
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,560
The print for that film didn't
arrive.

1117
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,240
They showed Abbott and Costello,
instead.

1118
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,920
They also showed Pathe News.

1119
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,280
And the report from Majdanek was
unbearable.

1120
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,280
Legs.

1121
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,200
Sticking in the air, stiff with
death.

1122
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,800
I couldn't watch it all.
You couldn't, either, could you?

1123
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,520
'I left.

1124
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,000
I don't know where I went.
I have no memory of anything.'

1125
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,240
Until...

1126
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,440
You met Johann.

1127
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,320
He came out of nowhere.

1128
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,120
(GASPS)

1129
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,160
'I looked up. I saw this face.'

1130
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,480
Aus dem Weg!

1131
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,680
'Out of my way.'
Dummkopf.

1132
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:10,160
'I saw this uniform, and this rage
went through me like a fire.

1133
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,920
I picked up a rock and...'

1134
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,960
(GROANS)

1135
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,720
A moment.

1136
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,000
That's all it took.

1137
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,640
'But it will define my entire life.'

1138
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,640
I killed a man. A boy.

1139
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,160
Perhaps the circumstances...
No, they offer no excuse.

1140
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,880
We are all tainted by this war,
in one way or another.

1141
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,760
But not everyone commits murder.

1142
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,360
Perhaps hearing him speak German?
Perhaps.

1143
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:58,840
Or perhaps it was because he was up
there...

1144
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:04,360
(TEARFULLY) and I was down there in
the gutter, where all Jews...belong.

1145
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:12,000
I had this evil taste in my mouth.

1146
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,200
I spat it out.

1147
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,240
That's all.

1148
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,120
I became the enemy.

1149
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,440
It's strange. I am a rational being.

1150
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,480
I am a scientist.
I believe in free will.

1151
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,960
And yet I cannot escape the fact

1152
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,400
that the most important events of my
life have been dictated by chance.

1153
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,840
I met my wife on a train I nearly
missed.

1154
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:43,480
I evaded death at Majdanek because I
was at a symposium in Paris.

1155
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:47,360
And I killed a man because I like
Bing Crosby and you do not.

1156
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,240
If you had been there...

1157
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,400
I'm sorry.

1158
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,960
How did you know?

1159
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,600
By chance...you were seen.

1160
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,920
'Who?'

1161
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,680
'By a troubled boy, to whom you
offered help.'

1162
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,360
Oh.

1163
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,400
Poor Tommy.

1164
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,040
MR CROOKS: I wanna see my son.

1165
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,840
Don't give me that.
LADY MURIEL: This way, please.

1166
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,360
Take your boots off, man.

1167
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,080
They're not dirty.

1168
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,640
Why can't you leave my Tommy alone?

1169
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,880
Ain't you got no son of your own?

1170
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,880
Not any more.

1171
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,840
He was killed at Dieppe.

1172
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,840
Right. Are you coming home, then?

1173
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,680
Dunno.
Now, look here, you...

1174
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,560
Don't shout at me!

1175
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,440
Look...I know you've been through
it.

1176
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,560
And I wish I could make it better.

1177
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,520
But words can't do the job, even if
I had 'em, which I ain't.

1178
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,960
I used to feel safe here.

1179
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,320
Well, you can come and visit the
ruling classes in your holidays.

1180
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,040
You know, if you really want to take
up this country life,

1181
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,920
then do it when the war's finished,
eh?

1182
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,440
Why do you want me to come back?
What does it matter to you?

1183
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,320
Cos you're mine, damn it!

1184
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,120
Cos I need you.

1185
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,720
I can't bear that house without your
mum.

1186
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,800
Come home, Tommy, please.

1187
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,280
Yeah, OK, then, Dad.

1188
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,080
I wanted to come and meet you.
Did you?

1189
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,520
It's like you're coming home all
over again.

1190
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,440
Yeah.

1191
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,000
Are you going to be all right?
Don't know.

1192
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,880
But I've got to try,
for all our sakes.

1193
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,840
Especially his.

1194
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,240
Come on. It's OK.

1195
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,120
Come to your dad.

1196
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,880
I'm sorry about everything.

1197
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,200
I'm sorry about...your friend.

1198
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,320
Were you and him...
Please.

1199
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,120
I've got to ask, even if it's not
what I want to hear.

1200
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,840
These last 18 months, I couldn't
have done without him, and that's
the truth.

1201
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,440
I was fond of him...

1202
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,320
and he was sweet on me.

1203
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,240
But the thing is, Fred...

1204
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,120
I was waiting for you.

1205
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,120
My sweetheart.

1206
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,400
I'm hungry.

1207
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,320
Are you hungry?

1208
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,960
Let's go home.

1209
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,720
RAUCOUS LAUGHTER

1210
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,600
KNOCK AT DOOR

1211
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,520
Sergeant. What are you doing here?
I thought you'd gone.

1212
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,560
Had to come back, sir.
You'll never guess. We've won!

1213
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,840
The war?
The football pools.

1214
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,400
Well, not the jackpot, but a tidy
old sum. A hundred quid.

1215
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,760
Why? Who got the line?
Guess.

1216
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,880
Milner.
(CHUCKLES) Not one draw.

1217
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,280
Not er...
No, sir.

1218
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,440
Oh, I see. It's you or me, is it?
Yes, it is, sir.

1219
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,000
And?

1220
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,680
It's a classic case of beginner's
luck. Chance has won the day, sir.

1221
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:38,520
Well, well, well. Thank you.
Port Vale drew with Arsenal?

1222
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,320
Well, the Gunners were a player
short. They borrowed two of Port
Vale's reserves.

1223
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,920
What are you going to do with the
money, sir?

1224
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,640
Well, I don't know. A hundred pounds.
That's quite a lot.

1225
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,080
What do you think? A donation,
perhaps? One of the refugee funds?

1226
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,640
Very good, sir. Yeah.
Yes. Good idea.

1227
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:59,680
There's a Jewish refugee fund.
Sergeant, would you...?

1228
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,560
Certainly, sir.

1229
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,360
And hold back a fiver, and we'll get
ourselves the best meal that rations
will allow.

1230
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,040
Hooray! Followed by a film at the
Ruby! Bing at his best!

1231
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,760
Do we have to?
(MIMICS CROSBY) # Ba-ba-ba

1232
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,880
# Home, home on the range... #

1233
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,000
Sad case, sir.

1234
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,600
Yeah.

1235
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,400
The funerals...
There will be no funerals.

1236
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,560
No next of kin. Nothing ever
happened here.

1237
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:51,080
Colonel...
A war always hides dirty secrets.

1238
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,040
And this secret's very dirty,
indeed.

1239
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,440
I wasn't responsible. You're
mistaken. Now, leave me alone.

1240
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,240
VE Day. That's what they're calling
it. Victory in Europe.

1241
