1
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
<i>He said,</i>

2
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,560
<i>that the day he climbed from
out of the mountain of bodies,</i>

3
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
<i>he was already dead</i>

4
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,360
All my men are dead

5
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,120
I am the only one left

6
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,680
That is because you have a good life

7
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,800
I pretended to be dead

8
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,280
My men, over 1600 strong

9
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,120
Fought for 3 days and nights

10
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,240
All gone

11
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,320
The Kui Army bastards just stood the rear and watched.

12
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,520
Watching my men die one by one

13
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,480
All dead ...

14
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,040
<i>He said, he met a woman that day</i>

15
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,480
<i>and spent a night in an abandoned run-down house</i>

16
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,480
<i>He wasn't sure if it was the bowl of gruel, or the woman</i>

17
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,800
<i>that made him feel</i>

18
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,360
<i>that he was still alive</i>

19
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
Where can I get some rice to eat?

20
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,680
Go wait in front of the old house on the main street

21
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
<i>He said</i>

22
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
<i>That on the first day he met me</i>

23
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,440
<i>The sky was ashen, just like his mood</i>

24
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,960
<i>But I remember vividly, that it was a clear day</i>

25
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,120
<i>Glaring to the eye</i>

26
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,040
After you've eaten, come and work to repay your lives

27
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,280
After you've eaten, come and work

28
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,293
Food!

29
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,200
Come, eat!

30
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,720
You fight well ... follow me!

31
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
I'll bring you to see big brother!

32
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
What work is it?

33
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,034
Robbery!
Steal army provisions!

34
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:52,773
<i>He later said, that we were foolishly brave</i>

35
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:54,720
<i>to dare to steal from troops</i>

36
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,680
<i>I replied, that there was no food within a 100 mile radius</i>

37
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,960
<i>When you're about to die from starvation,
I doesn't matter who's provisions they are</i>

38
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,880
Charge out!

39
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,760
Kill!

40
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,040
Quick! Kill the leader!

41
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,360
<i>That day, not only did he save me</i>

42
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,200
<i>He also taught me</i>

43
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,280
<i>[?] When beating a snake, you must beat it 7 inches,
To catch a thief, you must first catch the king</i>

44
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Brother WuYang

45
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,000
Look

46
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,240
It was from 'that' person

47
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,520
That's what Generals wear

48
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,200
Brother WuYang is a General

49
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,080
Brother WuYang is a General

50
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
What are you thinking about?

51
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,000
My home

52
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,640
They're back ...

53
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Don't be impatient, come, we have food!

54
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,400
Tonight we're going to have a feast!

55
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Why are you alone?

56
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,480
I ran away from home

57
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,440
By your accent, you are from YangZhou?

58
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,480
You picked up on it?

59
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
How did you pick that I had a YangZhou accent?

60
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,160
Have you heard of the YangZhou market?

61
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,920
That’s where they pick out the prettiest girls,
teach them the arts

62
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,840
And after they've grown up,
sell them to rich men as wives, right?

63
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,080
But ...

64
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
When I was 15

65
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
and about to be sold

66
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,160
A childhood friend

67
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,240
stole me back

68
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,880
He even killed someone

69
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,920
and took me to hide
in the mountains as a felon.

70
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,520
He didn't realize that you'd changed,
and thought that he was saving you

71
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
He is a good person

72
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,040
Rest in peace!

73
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,520
Rest in peace!

74
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,120
Big Brother's rules

75
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,880
Leave an empty place at the table
with a full cup, to honor the dead.

76
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,800
Were you a commander in the army?

77
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,200
It's in the past now

78
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,560
Why did you leave?

79
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,680
Come, drink!

80
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,880
We were Imperial troops,
and had agreed to join up to eliminate the enemy

81
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,600
The Kui Army promised but did not deliver

82
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
And we could not suppress the enemy

83
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
So all of my men died

84
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,720
The world is big, but not bigger
than the bond between brothers-in-arms

85
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,880
Right?

86
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,760
Without comrades

87
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,760
Life is not worth living

88
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,520
WuYang

89
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
Time to eat

90
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,280
Will the new people in the village, stay?

91
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,640
With rice to eat, who will leave?

92
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, there's one named Pang,
who is quite impressive

93
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Whether he will leave, I do not know

94
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,920
Doesn't it look nice?

95
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,080
I got it from a body

96
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,520
Do you know what this is?

97
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,680
No idea

98
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,200
A protection charm

99
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,440
Was that night real?

100
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,280
I stayed there waiting

101
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,560
I thought it was but a dream

102
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,440
If you'd already run away,

103
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,760
why did you come back?

104
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I've run away many times

105
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,680
It seems a good idea,

106
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,160
but each time I come back

107
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
Why do you come back?

108
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,760
One's fate should be decided by oneself

109
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,800
Hide here

110
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
... why are you taking our food

111
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,960
You want to hit me with your rod?

112
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,687
-Hit me! Hit me!
-Don't move! Don't move!

113
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:19,720
Stop!

114
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,741
How old are you?  You'd hit a grandmother?

115
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,741
Don't move, I'll shoot!  People will die!

116
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm not afraid of you

117
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,760
I'm serious, I'll shoot.  I'm serious ...

118
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,360
I'm not afraid!  You kill me!

119
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
You

120
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Nobody move

121
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Why aren't you looking at me?

122
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,280
Did you think that by raiding our supply cart,
the provisions would be all yours?

123
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm giving you a chance today

124
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,560
[?] report yourselves to the imperial government

125
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,040
Leave!

126
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,800
If we only had guns, we'd fight them

127
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,360
It'd still be suicide

128
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,560
Living like this, I'd rather die

129
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,000
Being a bandit is a dog's life; always on the run

130
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,320
Why don't we join the army?

131
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,800
In the army, we'd get paid

132
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,600
With the money we can buy food for our families

133
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,640
In the army we'd have weapons.
With weapons, no-one would dare attack us.

134
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,720
The village would have true peace

135
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
We are bandits

136
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,320
Would the government accept us?

137
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,480
The Kui Army is a big military power

138
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,920
They won't even bother with our little band

139
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,360
But ChenGong needs manpower

140
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,680
His Lu Army is constantly being harassed by the Kui Army

141
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
And he wants to be a major military power

142
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,920
If we side with him, it would be perfect timing

143
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,880
ErHu, grasp this opportunity

144
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,440
And let today's events, never happen again

145
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,280
Fine

146
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,320
Bandits

147
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,560
We have to be the best!

148
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,661
In the past you were a Qing soldier
Now you want us to join the army?

149
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:40,130
You have no loyalty

150
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
Why should we trust you?

151
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,840
Swear a blood oath

152
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,920
Today, Pang ChingYun

153
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,808
Cao ErHu

154
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:58,960
Jiang WuYang

155
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,519
Swear an oath, to be blood brothers

156
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,935
[?] In each other we entrust, to save from danger

157
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,300
[?] Together in prosperity or difficulty

158
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,059
[?] If an outsider disrupts our brotherhood

159
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,280
[?] By our oath, they must die

160
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,579
[?] If a brother disrupts our brotherhood

161
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,591
[?] By our oath, they must die

162
00:24:15,107 --> 00:24:17,560
[?] With the heaven and earth as our witness

163
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:20,362
[?]

164
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,920
[?] Together in one heart

165
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,480
<i>He later told me,</i>

166
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,320
<i>He didn't believe in blood oaths</i>

167
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,280
<i>I asked what he did believe in</i>

168
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,886
<i>He said that he believed in Brother ErHu</i>

169
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:34,586
<i>and me</i>

170
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Wait, take these shoes

171
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,280
Be careful on the road

172
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,680
Mother won't be able to see you again

173
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
Mum, I'm leaving

174
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,080
Brother ErHu

175
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,960
Shi JiMiao has taken a group of men

176
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,868
He only said one thing

177
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,914
That he'd rather die than join the army

178
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
I heard

179
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,360
You led a battalion of men to suppress the enemy in HeChuan

180
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,600
But they all perished

181
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,720
You disappeared for 2 months, and you have the audacity to return?

182
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,000
Lord Chen

183
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,640
At the battle of HeChuan

184
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,920
Lord Jiang sent the Kui Army to guard my left wing

185
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
He Kui, fearing the enemy, retreated 30 Li

186
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,160
This is how my battalion of men all died

187
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,600
The whole army perished

188
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,840
And you were the only survivor?

189
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,520
I didn't die

190
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,196
So that I could come back to see you, Lord Jiang

191
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,177
How many men do you have?

192
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,150
Eight Hundred

193
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,560
Give me another 800

194
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,881
And within 15 days, I will take SongCheng

195
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:56,081
A soldier should not tell lies

196
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,083
10 days

197
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,000
I will take SongCheng in 10 days

198
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,352
Fine

199
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:05,464
I ...

200
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,960
I will give you another 1500 soldiers

201
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,505
But there will be no pay

202
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,760
That's not necessary

203
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,600
After I take the city, I want half of everything

204
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,695
Pang ChingYun

205
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,560
Your banner is [Deer Mountain]

206
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,241
Well call them the Mountain Army then

207
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,160
Thank you, my lords

208
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:36,640
You're taking a gamble

209
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,951
With the lives of 800 men

210
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,201
War has always been a gamble

211
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,952
I won't gamble

212
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:46,572
These 1500 soldiers are ChenGong's foundation

213
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:47,560
If they go

214
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,379
ChenGong will lose all power in the Imperial court

215
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,414
So when will you make your move?

216
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,520
My soldiers

217
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Will only serve to make your force look more threatening

218
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
This is your only chance for victory

219
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,840
Otherwise

220
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,388
The Kui Army will forever have you under their feet

221
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,640
Big Brother

222
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,600
They're all faulty

223
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,952
Over there are 200 guns

224
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:31,775
It will be a difficult battle

225
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,040
There is only one way to win

226
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:41,316
A blind charge, to destroy their artillery

227
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,040
A battle of ruthlessness

228
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
Comrades

229
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,218
Tell him, who is the fiercest?

230
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:49,833
We're the fiercest!

231
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,680
Our armies are separated by 300 paces

232
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,098
Their guns have a range of 200 paces

233
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,075
Arrows have a range of 100 paces

234
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:59,598
We need 200 men in the frontline to charge

235
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,113
Followed by 200 archers

236
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,640
When they fire, don't stop.  Continue the charge

237
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,473
Follow it through to the end

238
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,680
To let the archers gain that 100 paces

239
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,720
Many men will die

240
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:23,143
I'll go!

241
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,840
Who will go with me?

242
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,280
The families for those who go will be paid extra

243
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,467
Those who die, 2 pieces, those who live 3 pieces!

244
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:37,999
Go make your fortunes

245
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,599
[?]

246
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:41,218
Come

247
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,166
Damn it, I'll go!

248
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,312
Me too!

249
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
Include me, I'll go ...

250
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:50,967
Me too ...

251
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,042
I'll go ... Me too ...

252
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,542
Defeat SongCheng!

253
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,920
Seize gold, seize food, seize land!

254
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,836
Defeat SongCheng!

255
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,640
Seize gold, seize food, seize land!

256
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,523
[?], the victor has already been decided

257
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,440
We are merciful, surrender and we will spare your lives

258
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:15,745
Kill!

259
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,200
Fire!

260
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Kill!

261
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:12,099
Fire!

262
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,600
Fire!

263
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:26,113
Fire!

264
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,480
Kill!

265
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:39,276
They're almost all dead, why aren't we going yet?

266
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,900
Don't you ever forget

267
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,376
On the battlefield, there can only be one commander

268
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,850
Kill!

269
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,720
Release the arrows!

270
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:14,816
Release!

271
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Brother!

272
00:33:58,219 --> 00:33:59,310
Brother!

273
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:03,628
Brother!

274
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,455
Ready!

275
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,240
Blindfold the horses

276
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:03,171
Charge!

277
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,960
Save Big Brother!

278
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,731
Big Brother!

279
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,716
Don't pull it out!

280
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:18,717
Hold steady

281
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:40,239
We're really going to die here!

282
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
We made a blood oath

283
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,780
We pray not to be born together, but to die together!

284
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,351
Well said

285
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
Even in death we need to take something with us

286
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,080
Everyone we kill counts!

287
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,477
Charge out!

288
00:38:56,577 --> 00:38:58,960
Kill!

289
00:39:04,197 --> 00:39:05,280
Insane!

290
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:08,279
Those 800 men have thrown 5000 soldiers into chaos

291
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,480
We can fight!

292
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,480
We desperately need this victory!

293
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
On me! Charge!

294
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,720
WuYang!

295
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,720
Lord Li

296
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,200
Pang ChingYun can be considered a blessing

297
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,000
Pang ChingYun, it seems we have a destiny together

298
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,800
Seems you've found yourself a treasure there

299
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,600
With the SongCheng battle, you've made name for yourself

300
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,200
Pang ChingYun

301
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,840
I'll put another 5 battalions under your command.
How about it?

302
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,640
[?] It's like adding flowers to a bouquet

303
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,025
-Lun DaShan
-Present

304
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,955
From now you are responsible for transferring funds

305
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,067
Thank you, Sir

306
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,360
Pang ChingYun

307
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,000
There's an old friend from the Kui Army waiting for you

308
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,000
He Kui

309
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,610
Present

310
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,548
My Lord

311
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,720
General Pang

312
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,280
Long time no see

313
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,360
As you already know each other,
you should continue to cooperate together

314
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:43,271
You conquer the cities, and he'll defend them

315
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:44,536
With him here, how'll we split it?

316
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,680
Lord Li

317
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,080
Lord Chen

318
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,960
I trust you're agreeable with this?

319
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:50,953
I'm scared that he'll be too slow to keep up

320
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,200
First we'll take SuZhou, then Nanjing

321
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,107
How about it?

322
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,520
What are they laughing at?

323
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,400
Nanjing is the enemies heart

324
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,600
To break Nanjing, you must take SuZhou first

325
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,520
If the war ends, they have nothing to gain

326
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,320
They won't let us fight SuZhou

327
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,600
Can they do anything if we do go and fight?

328
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,960
Inserting the Kui Army

329
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,440
was so that they could keep an eye on us

330
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,840
Come quick, they're back!

331
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,680
XiaoWu

332
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:27,690
XiaoWu ....

333
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,400
XiaoWu's shoes ....

334
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:37,112
XiaoWu ...

335
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,043
XiaoQi

336
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,080
XiaoQi, my son!

337
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,603
<i>We were no longer bandits</i>

338
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,120
<i>He said, that bandits only kill for their own</i>

339
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,520
<i>But we, were risking ourselves for others</i>

340
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
<i>I'm willing to be this kind of person</i>

341
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
You've lost weight

342
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:18,596
Big Brother said, that this time we'll be back in 3 years

343
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,160
I know that you don't like it here

344
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:26,673
Once I'm done fighting, I'll take you somewhere nice to spend our days

345
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,920
Where's Big Brother?

346
00:44:28,076 --> 00:44:29,243
He's just outside the village

347
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,000
He said that he won't come in

348
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,925
We set out early tomorrow morning

349
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:02,960
Remember

350
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,480
All's fair in war

351
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:05,386
Begin!

352
00:46:12,076 --> 00:46:13,076
Kill!

353
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:39,029
We're here to take over defense of the city

354
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,280
And let our comrades indulge themselves for 3 days

355
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:43,904
Seize money, seize food, seize land!

356
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:23,243
Come out, the battle is over

357
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,280
Come out

358
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,330
Come on out

359
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:27,244
Don't be afraid

360
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:28,529
You haven't eaten, right?

361
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,840
Are you hungry?

362
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,400
What are you doing?  Miss!

363
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,560
Are you going to watch?

364
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,240
GouZi, I'm leaving

365
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:01,134
Brother Pang

366
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:04,134
Move!

367
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:04,720
What is it?

368
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,880
Why are you holding me?

369
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:06,187
Move!

370
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:07,480
What is it?

371
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:10,344
Harming the innocent, will be punished on the spot!

372
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,600
Brother ErHu!

373
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:14,121
Big Brother, what happened?

374
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:15,600
Rape of a girl

375
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:18,509
Looting the city for 3 days, these are the rules

376
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,960
From today, this sort of thing cannot occur in our ranks

377
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,400
We've always done this

378
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,920
We were bandits, now we're soldiers

379
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,440
If we don't change, we won't accomplish anything

380
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,720
If we continue to do this

381
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,880
We'll be just like those Kui Army bastards

382
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Rules must start somewhere.  That day is now

383
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,040
We've just finished killing their family members

384
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,560
Now that we're here

385
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,440
You want protect them?

386
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,200
Who will fight for you in the future?

387
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,400
Big Brother

388
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,160
Listen to me

389
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,360
Look at them

390
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,840
They get it

391
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,480
You don't need to kill them, right?

392
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,400
What are you doing?

393
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,200
Hurry up an admit your mistake!

394
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Big Brother, we were wrong.  We won't do it again!
