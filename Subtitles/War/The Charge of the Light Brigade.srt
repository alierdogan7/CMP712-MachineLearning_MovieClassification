PERFECTLY SAFE ANYWHERE.

YOU WERE ABLE TO COME.

177
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,334
YOUR MESSAGE SAID
IT WAS URGENT.

178
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,836
IT IS.

179
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,337
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

180
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,873
MY BROTHER ARRIVES
IN CALCUTTA TODAY.

181
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,042
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

182
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,010
WORD CAME THROUGH
FROM HEADQUARTERS
LAST NIGHT.

183
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,446
NOW YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHY IT WAS SO URGENT
FOR ME TO SEE YOU.

184
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,182
GEOFFREY'S
COMING HERE.

185
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,184
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I MUST KNOW.

186
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,186
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

187
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,354
OH, PERRY.

188
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,357
I KNOW WE BOTH TRIED
TO BE LOYAL TO GEOFFREY

189
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,025
BY HIDING
OUR REAL FEELINGS,

190
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,028
BUT NOW HE'S
COMING BACK, AND WE
CAN'T GO ON PRETENDING.

191
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,697
YOU DO LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

192
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,700

SO HARD NOT TO,
BUT I DO LOVE YOU.</i>

193
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,201
I KNEW IT.

194
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,903
BUT I'M STILL ENGAGED
TO GEOFFREY.

195
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,905
WE MUST TELL HIM
THE MOMENT HE GETS HERE.

196
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,907
<i>I MEAN, I MUST TELL HIM.
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.</i>

197
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,909
AND WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE FEEL, HE WON'T
STAND IN OUR WAY.

198

HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

199
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,080
HE WILL.
DARLING, I KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

200
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,016
I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM.
IT'S THE ONLY DECENT
THING TO DO.

YES, PERRY...

00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,445
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT
THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE
OF THE SITUATION

WELL, SIR CHARLES,
SINCE YOUR KINDLY GOVERNMENT

SECONDED
FROM HIS REGIMENT

00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,709
FOR DUTY
WITH THE POLITICAL
DEPARTMENT.

381
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,878
OH, DEAR.
HOW SILLY OF ME.

EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.

AND MOTHERLESS.

WELL, AS I ALWAYS SAY,
COLONEL, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

386
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,193
I MUST START LOOKING AROUND
RIGHT AWAY

387
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,195
TO FIND A SUITABLE WIFE
FOR YOU.

388
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,698
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOU MUST BE A LITTLE
MORE GUARDED--

JUST BEEN BEGGING ME
TO FIND HIM A WIFE.

WHAT PARTICULAR QUALITY DO YOU
MOST ADMIRE IN A WOMAN?

THE QUALITY
OF SILENCE.

00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,875
NOW, COLONEL,
YOU'RE FLATTERING ME,

"LADY WARRENTON,"
HE SAID,

"YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DRIVE MEN MAD."

399
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,886
I CAN BELIEVE THAT.

400
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,287
FORGIVE ME.

401
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,724
WHAT A DULL DOG
THE COLONEL IS.

402
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,726
HASN'T A WORD TO SAY
FOR HIMSELF.

403
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:49,960

SO BEAUTIFUL.

I--I CAN'T STAND
THIS ANY LONGER.

407
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,307
WE'VE GOT TO
FIND A WAY TO TELL
GEOFFREY TONIGHT.

408
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,242
YES, YES.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

409
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,912

TOGETHER. YOU KNOW THIS PLACE
IS FULL OF SCANDALMONGERS.

ALONE.

DECEIVING GEOFFREY
LIKE THIS.

HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

413
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,419
HE'S A GREAT FELLOW.
HE'S HUMAN.

414
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,422
IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THAT
WE MUSTN'T HURT HIM ANY MORE
THAN WE CAN HELP.

415

LET ME TELL HIM
IN MY OWN WAY. AFTER ALL,
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

WHEN HE KNOWS
HOW WE REALLY FEEL,

417
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,429
HE CAN'T THINK
THAT WE'RE IN THE WRONG.

418
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,931
WRONG?

IF WE DON'T TELL HIM.</i>

UNLESS WHAT,
YOUR HIGHNESS?

499
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:34,652
I SOMETIMES THINK,
SIR CHARLES,

500
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,154
THAT A GREAT
GOVERNMENT RESEMBLES
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

501
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,857
WHO, INTOXICATED
WITH THE POWER
OF HER OWN BEAUTY,

502
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,159
IS APT TO
WITHDRAW FROM
A SINCERE SUITOR

503
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,161
THE FAVORS SHE'S
ALWAYS GRANTED,

504
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,163
AND WHEN SHE FINDS
THIS SUITOR

505
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,165
CONSOLE HIMSELF
WITH ANOTHER BEAUTY,

506
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,667
REGRETS
HER COLDNESS.

507
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,935
INTERESTING. AND WHAT
DOES SHE DO THEN?

508
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,938
SHE CLAIMS THE PRIVILEGE
OF ANY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
AND CHANGES HER MIND

509
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,274
BEFORE SHE'S LOST
HER SUITOR FOREVER.

510
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,809
DO YOU NOT AGREE?

511
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,278
THE ONLY GREAT GOVERNMENT
I'M ACQUAINTED WITH

512
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,780
IS SINGULARLY MASCULINE.

513
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,782
IT MAKES UP ITS MIND,

514
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,785
AND ONCE HAVING REACHED
A DECISION, ADHERES TO IT.

515
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,953
I'M AFRAID WE'RE
LOSING OURSELVES

516
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,955
IN A FLIGHT
OF FANTASY.

517
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,291
[CHUCKLES]
YES. PERHAPS. YES.

518
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,797
OH, GEOFF.

519
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,465
PERRY, OLD LAD,
HAVE YOU SEEN ELSA?

520
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,900
LADY WARRENTON,
THIS IS MY BROTHER
GEOFFREY.

521
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,201
HOW DO YOU DO?

522
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,803
YOU ARE THE FIANCE
OF THAT EXQUISITE
CHILD. AM I RIGHT?

523
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,104
YOU ARE RIGHT.

524
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,472
CAPITAL.
I CONGRATULATE YOU,

525
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:29,973
BUT YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE

526
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,975
ON THIS VERY ATTRACTIVE
BROTHER OF YOURS.

527
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,977
I SAW MISS CAMPBELL AND HIM
DANCING TONIGHT.

528
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,946
THE LOOK IN HIS EYE
WAS ANYTHING BUT DIPLOMATIC.

529
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:36,947
AHA.

530
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,215
BENJI!

531
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,453
MR. VICKERS,
NEVER MARRY A MAN
WITH AN INDIAN LIVER.

532
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:43,954
LADY WARRENTON,
I WON'T.

533
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,322
BENJI!

534
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,857
THANK HEAVENS.

535
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,959
OH, GEOFFREY,
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

536
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,195
OH, THERE'S ELSA NOW.
WAIT A MINUTE, OLD BOY.

537
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,965
ELSA, DARLING,
I'M SORRY I MISSED
SO MANY DANCES.

538
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,967
YOU KNOW HOW
THESE DIPLOMATIC
AFFAIRS ARE.

539
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:57,968
SHALL WE DANCE NOW?

540
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,471
I'D LOVE TO.
DO YOU MIND, SIR?

541
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,039
NOT AT ALL.

542
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,815
LOOK AROUND YOU.

543
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:12,983
WHY?

544
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,985
HERE
IN THIS ONE ROOM,

545
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,488
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES THE WORLD
GO ROUND--

546
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,490
RICHES, INTRIGUE,
AND ALL THE SEEDS

547
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,492
OF MUTINY, WAR,
AND HATRED.

548
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,994
YOU KNOW WHAT IT ALL
MEANS TO ME?

549
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,496
WHAT?

550
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:26,997
NOTHING.
JUST NOTHING.

551
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,999
YOU'RE
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S REAL HERE.

552
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:32,002
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT I'M HOLDING YOU
IN MY ARMS

553
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,504
AND THAT...

554
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,005
THAT
YOU'RE SO LOVELY.

555
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,406
OH, GEOFFREY.

556
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,711
ELSA...I LOVE YOU.

557
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,464
[WHISTLING]

558
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,902
HELLO, OLD LAD.
GLAD YOU CAME IN
AND WAITED.

559
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,904
I HAD TO.

560
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:07,905
MIGHT HAVE MISSED
YOU COMPLETELY.

561
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,072
I'M OFF AGAIN
TOMORROW.

562
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,908
ARE YOU GOING
WITH THE CAMPBELLS
TO CHUKOTI?

563
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,075
NO. WORSE LUCK.

564
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,911
I'M GOING UP
ON THE ARABIAN
FRONTIER

565
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,412
TO BUY A PACK
OF HORSES.

566
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,247
WE NEED PLENTY
OF THEM, YOU KNOW,
AND GOOD ONES.

567
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,749
SOUNDS
LIKE TROUBLE
ON THE BALKANS.

568
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,450
YES. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.

569
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,252
I TRIED TO SOUND OUT
OLD MACEFIELD ABOUT IT,

570
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,887
BUT HE CLOSED UP
LIKE AN OYSTER.

571
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:25,923
HOWEVER, IT MUST BE THAT.

572
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,425
HE TOLD ME TO HURRY,
AND WILL I.

573
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,927
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY.

574
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,963
GEOFFREY...I...

575
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,899
I'VE NEVER
THANKED YOU FOR ALL
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

576
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,935
OH, NONSENSE,
OLD LAD.

577
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,404
YOU'VE BEEN A SUCCESS.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

578
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,905
BUT SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED.

579
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,407
I KNOW
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

580
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,408
WELL, WHAT?

581
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,643
I'VE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH ELSA.

582
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:57,154
OH, I'M SORRY, OLD LAD.
HOW ROTTEN FOR YOU.

583
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:00,490
YES, BUT, GEOFF,
ELSA'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

584
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,260
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

585
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:04,761
I DO, UNFORTUNATELY.

586
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,497
WE TRIED NOT TO.
HONESTLY, WE DID,
GEOFF.

587
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,067
I SEE.

588
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,940
MIGHT I ASK
WHAT YOU INTEND
DOING ABOUT IT?

589
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,942
HAS ELSA TOLD YOU
THAT SHE LOVES YOU?

590
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,944
HAS SHE PROMISED
TO MARRY YOU?

591
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,447
YES, BUT NOT
IN SO MANY WORDS.

592
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,449
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU'RE LYING.

593
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,451
THIS IS SPLENDID.

594
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,553
AFTER SNIVELING
TO ME ABOUT HOW
GRATEFUL HE IS,

595
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,455
MY BROTHER COMES
TO ME AND TELLS ME
HE'S STOLEN

596
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,857
THE AFFECTIONS OF
THE ONE PERSON I LOVE
MOST IN THE WORLD.

597
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,125
BUT NOT CONTENT
WITH THAT,

598
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,460
YOU'VE GOT
THE EFFRONTERY TO
COME HERE AND LIE.

599
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:37,461
YOU CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT.

600
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,029
LIE AND LIE.

601
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,466
LISTEN...

602
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,034
YOU'D BETTER
GET OUT.

603
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,869
TAKE YOUR DIRTY INTRIGUE
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

604
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,972
BUT GET OUT OF MY SIGHT
AND STAY OUT.

605
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,974
VERY WELL,

606
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,477
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU THIS.

607
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,479
I'VE ALWAYS
LOOKED UP TO YOU,

608
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,481
WORSHIPED YOU
AS A KIND OF GOD.

609
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,983
I FIND YOU'RE RATHER
A LITTLE MAN.

610
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,986
AND AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

611
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:06,056
YOU AND OLD CAMPBELL
AND THE WHOLE BLASTED ARMY
CAN GO TO BLAZES.

612
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,479
OH, GOOD MORNING,
SIR.

613
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,981
OH, GEOFFREY.
EARLY VISIT, HUH?

614
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,983
YES, SIR. I JUST HAD
MY ORDERS, AND I'M
SETTING OUT.

615
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,985
I THOUGHT I'D
COME ALONG AND SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOU.

616
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,486
JUST TO ME?

617
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,488
WELL, SHALL WE SAY
THE FAMILY?

618
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,224
ELSA'S STILL IN HER ROOM,
BUT I'LL CALL HER.

619
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,993
TELL MEMSAHIB SHE'S WANTED
IN THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY.

620
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,428
CAPTAIN VICKERS IS HERE.

621
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,196
[SPEAKING FOREIGN
LANGUAGE]

622
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,998
YOU HAVE
A VERY DIFFICULT JOB
AHEAD OF YOU.

623
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,499
YES, I THINK SO.

624
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,001
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE EQUAL TO IT.

625
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,002
THANK YOU, SIR.

626
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,003
SO GOOD-BYE.

627
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,004
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

628
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,006
COME BACK TO US
SAFELY AND SOON.

629
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,074
THANK YOU.

630
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,679
OH, GEOFFREY.

631
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,515
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR?
ARE YOU LEAVING US
SO SOON?

632
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,017
YES, I'M AFRAID SO.

633
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,518
I SUPPOSE THIS IS
WHAT'S KNOWN

634
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,187
AS THE LUCK
OF THE ARMY.

635
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,022
THEY SHOW YOU
A BRIEF GLIMPSE
OF PARADISE

636
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,523
AND THEN
TAKE IT AWAY.

637
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,525
I SUPPOSE, IN TIME,
I'LL LEARN
TO BE GRATEFUL

638
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,327
FOR EVEN A FEW HOURS
WITH YOU.

639
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,362
HOW LONG WILL YOU
BE AWAY?

640
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,430
OH, A MONTH, TWO MONTHS.
HARD TO SAY.

641
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,798
THERE'S SO MUCH TROUBLE
GOING ON EVERYWHERE,

642
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,002
WE'VE GOT TO BE
READY FOR IT
WHEN IT COMES,

643
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,137
BUT AS SOON AS I
COME BACK THIS TIME,

644
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,772
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THE ARMY
OR ANYTHING ELSE

645
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,274
INTERFERE
WITH OUT HAPPINESS,
OUR MARRIAGE,

646
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,743
ARE WE, DARLING?

647
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,811
OF COURSE NOT,
GEOFFREY.

648
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,680
RIGHT.
IT'S A BARGAIN.

649
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,425
GOOD-BYE, MY LOVE.

650
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,994
I'LL HURRY BACK
SO FAST.

651
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,432
OH...

652
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,501
ELSA,
THERE'S SOMETHING...

653
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,304
I THINK I OUGHT
TO TELL YOU
BEFORE I GO.

654
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,974
IT'S RATHER SILLY,

655
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,809
BUT LAST NIGHT
AFTER THE BALL,

656
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,378
PERRY
CAME TO SEE ME.

657
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,947
HE'S IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

658
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,549
YOU KNOW, HE'S
QUITE IMPULSIVE,

659
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,218
AND HE SEEMS
TO BE TAKING THIS
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

660
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,620
I WAS VERY STUPID
ABOUT IT.

661
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,488
I LOST MY TEMPER
COMPLETELY.

662
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,224
NOW, OF COURSE,
I COULD KICK MYSELF,

663
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,726
BUT I DON'T
WANT HIM TO BE HURT

664
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,228
MORE THAN NECESSARY,
YOU KNOW?

665
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,465
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY, GEOFF.

666
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,933
I SHAN'T BE SEEING PERRY

ELSA, TO UNDERSTAND IT
LIKE THAT.

ON RUSSIA,

00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,524
ALL THESE FELLOWS KNOW
THAT ENGLAND AND FRANCE

682

WITH THE RUSSIANS.

00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,286
EYES LEFT.

836
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,142
HALT!

837
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,589
REPORTING OUR RETURN
FROM CALCUTTA, SIR.

838
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,090
GOOD, MAJOR VICKERS.
ANY CASUALTIES?

839
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:10,092
YES, SIR.
ONE MAN WOUNDED.

840
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,361
WE WERE FIRED ON
SEVERAL TIMES,
BUT WE EXPECTED THAT.

841
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,230
DID YOU RETURN FIRE?

842
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:15,932
NO, SIR.

843
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:18,968
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
SIR BENJAMIN'S ORDERS
ARE TO MAINTAIN PEACE.

844
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,103
PRETTY DIFFICULT ORDERS
TO FOLLOW, SIR,

845
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,172
PARTICULARLY WHEN
THEY'RE FIRING ON US.

846
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:26,442
YES. WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN SOLDIERING
AS LONG AS I HAVE,

847
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,811
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
IT'S BEST TO FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDLESS.

848
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:30,012
YES, SIR.

849
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:34,016
BY THE WAY,
IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL

850
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,118
FOR AN OFFICER
TO APPEAR BEFORE HIS
COMMANDANT'S DAUGHTER

851
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,587
IN SUCH A CONDITION.

852
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:39,088
RUN ALONG
AND CLEAN UP

853
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,590
AND COME BACK
TO MY OFFICE.

854
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:41,691
YES, SIR.

855
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,531
TROOP,
FACE LEFT ABOUT!
WALK MARCH!

856
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,682
ASK MISS CAMPBELL
TO COME TO MY OFFICE
IMMEDIATELY.

857
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,024
HALT!

858
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,695
FALL OUT THE OFFICERS.

859
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,065
PREPARE TO DISMOUNT!

860
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,702
DISMOUNT!

861
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,707
DISMISSED.

862
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:37,513
CAPTAIN SAHIB!

863
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,015
PREMA!

864
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,516
UP YOU GO.

865
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:42,084
THANK YOU, SAHIB.

866
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,920
LOOK, I BROUGHT YOU BACK
A NEW SALUTE.

867
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,087
WATCH.

868
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,925
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

869
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,092
LIKE THIS.

870
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,599
TRY IT ON THE GENERAL.

871
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:08,177
WELL, MISS CAMPBELL
LEFT WITH THE FIRST PATROL
THIS MORNING, SIR.

872
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,846
CONFOUND IT!

873
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,616
WELL, UH, YES.
THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S ALL.

874
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,060
WHY DIDN'T ELSA
TELL ME OF THIS?

875
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:27,563
THAT GIRL'S
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO ME. OUTRAGEOUS!

876
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,733
SHE KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL YOU
WERE ARRIVING TODAY.

877
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,034
PARDON, SIR?

878
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,537
ELSA LEFT FOR LOHARA
THIS MORNING.

879
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:38,507
LADY WARRENTON
MIGHT BE ILL, SIR.
SHE MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR HER.

880
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,776
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF,
AND WHAT IF SHE WERE?

881
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:42,244
THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

882
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,050
[LADY WARRENTON]
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME--

883
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:49,552
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE HAD
A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY.

884
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,121
A NICE CUP OF HOT TEA
WILL REALLY REFRESH YOU,
MY DEAR.

885
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:56,325
I'LL NEVER FORGET MY
APPALLING HONEYMOON TRIP
WITH DARLING BENJI.

886
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,861
YOU REMEMBER, DEAR?
BENJI!

887
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,731
YES, DEAR? BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE, DEAR.

888
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:04,066
HERE'S SOME NICE COLD WATER
TO TAKE WITH YOUR PILL.

889
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:07,069
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
DRINK A LITTLE TOAST
TO OUR DELIGHTFUL GUEST.

890
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:10,072
KEEP ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN.

891
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:11,574
I HOPE
YOU AND SIR BENJAMIN

892
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,576
DIDN'T MIND MY COMING
UNINVITED LIKE THIS.

893
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:15,044
CERTAINLY NOT.
DELIGHTED.

894
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,545
MIND?
WE'RE ENCHANTED.

895
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:19,081
BY THE WAY, HOW IS THAT
RAVISHINGLY HANDSOME
FIANCE OF YOURS?

896
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,083
YOUNG VICKERS.
DUE HERE TODAY.

897
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,618
NO, BENJI,
YOU'RE ALL MUDDLED.

898
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,820
ELSA IS ENGAGED
TO THE OTHER BROTHER,
GODFREY.

899
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,322
GEOFFREY, DEAR.

900
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,090
SOME CAKE?

901
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,558
NO, THANK YOU.

902
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,094
SO THE BROTHER IS COMING.
WELL, WELL, WELL.

903
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:33,596
THAT IS A COINCIDENCE.

904
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,599
MY DEAR, YOU REMEMBER
THE APPALLING BALL
IN CALCUTTA?

905
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:40,102
WELL, I WAS CONVINCED
THAT YOU AND HE WERE, UH...

906
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:41,637
SO TO SPEAK.

907
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,739
[SIR BENJAMIN]
PAY NO ATTENTION TO
MY WIFE, MISS CAMPBELL.

908
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:46,108
SHE HAS TWO OBSESSIONS
IN LIFE--

909
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,910
GIVING ME PILLS
AND SCANDALOUS INTRIGUE.

910
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:51,113
CAPTAIN VICKERS,
SAHIB.

911
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,115
THANK YOU.

912
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,116
LADY WARRENTON.

913
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:55,618
GLAD TO SEE YOU,
VICKERS.

914
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,685
SIR BENJAMIN.

915
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:59,121
<i>ELSA! WHY,
THIS IS A SURPRISE.</i>

916
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,990
HOW ARE YOU, PERRY?

917
00:51:00,992 --> 00:51:02,691
[SIR BENJAMIN]
GOOD TRIP,
MY BOY?

918
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:06,629
DON'T BE ABSURD, BENJI.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GOOD TRIP IN INDIA.

919
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:09,632
ONE EITHER TRAVELS IN
COMPARATIVE DISCOMFORT
OR IN COMPLETE DISCOMFORT.

920
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,133
MINE WAS COMPLETE.

921
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,636
YOU TWO CHILDREN
WANT TO BE ALONE, I KNOW.

922
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,205
YOU MUST TELL ELSA
ALL ABOUT GODFREY.

923
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,273
GEOFFREY, DEAR.

924
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,774
ALL ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

925
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,278
THOUGH, WHY YOU'RE NOT
GREEN WITH JEALOUSY OF HIM

926
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,114
FOR ANNEXING THIS ADORABLE
CREATURE, I CAN'T IMAGINE.

927
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,549
COME, BENJI.

928
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:29,151
OH, PLEASE DON'T
DISTURB YOURSELF,
LADY WARRENTON.

929
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,686
ELSA AND I
WILL TAKE A STROLL.

930
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:31,687
SHALL WE?

931
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:32,855
YES.

932
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:36,625
NO, NO, NO.
NOT OUT THERE.
NOT ON THE VERANDA.

933
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,562
THERE. IN
THE SUMMER HOUSE...

934
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,564
WHERE THE BIRDS
ARE SINGING

935
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:43,132
AND THE FLOWERS
ARE BURGEONING.

936
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,701
ACROSS THE VERANDA
AND DOWN THE WALK.

937
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,141
REALLY, OCTAVIA.
YOUR CONSTANT INNUENDOS
ARE INTOLERABLE.

938
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,643
YOU FULLY EMBARRASSED
YOUNG VICKERS
AND THE CAMPBELL GIRL,

939
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,145
NOT TO MENTION ME.

940
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,147
WHY CAN'T YOU RESIST
POKING YOUR NOSE

941
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,849
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S
PRIVATE AFFAIRS?

942
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:01,650
IS NOTHING SACRED
TO YOU?

943
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,719
YES, BENJI, DEAR.
YOUR LIVER.

944
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,158
IT'S WONDERFUL OF YOU
TO COME HERE LIKE THIS.

945
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,161
WHEN I SAW YOU JUST NOW,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
POSSIBLE.

946
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,163
WHY DID YOU
TAKE SUCH A RISK?

947
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,664
I HAD TO.

948
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,667
I'VE TRIED TO FORCE MYSELF
TO FORGET YOU.

949
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,536
I'VE EVEN TRIED
TO HATE YOU,

950
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,005
BUT I LOVE YOU.

951
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:24,974
I ALWAYS HAVE,
AND I ALWAYS SHALL.

952
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,375
DARLING.

953
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,545
POOR FATHER.
YOU SEE, HE'S RIGHT
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.

954
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:32,548
HE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TRY TO GET OVER IT.

955
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,550
I DID TRY...
FOR THREE MONTHS,
BUT I FAILED,

956
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,053
SO I THREW AWAY
ALL COMMON SENSE
AND CAME HERE TO YOU

957
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:41,624
TO MAKE SURE THAT--
THAT YOU'RE READY
TO FACE EVERYTHING WITH ME.

958
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,060
MY LOVE FOR YOU
IS EVEN STRONGER,

959
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,062
MORE A PART OF ME
THAN EVER.

960
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,564
I WAS SURE OF IT.

961
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,065
TOMORROW I MUST GO
BACK TO CHUKOTI

962
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:52,067
AND TELL
FATHER AND GEOFFREY

963
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:57,006
THAT WHATEVER HAPPINESS
THERE IS IN ME TO GIVE
MUST BE GIVEN TO YOU.

964
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,629
PARADES, LEFT!

965
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,065
TROOP, HALT!

966
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,066
[BUGLING]

967
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:27,736
STABLES. COMING?

968
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,738
PARADE LEFT,
COLUMN LEFT. MARCH!

969
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,782
REPORT THE RETURN
OF THE CONVOY, SIR.

970
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:41,150
VERY GOOD.

971
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,054
SIR BENJAMIN'S
COMPLIMENTS, SIR.

972
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,322
YOU'VE HAD A SCRAP.

973
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:49,959
WE WERE FIRED UPON
BY THE SURISTANIS
IN KOHRUD PASS.

974
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:51,026
WELL, YOU HAD
YOUR ORDERS?

975
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:53,429
YES, SIR. MY PATROL
WITHDREW IN GOOD ORDER,

976
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:56,065
BUT WE LOST A MAN--
LANCER WENTWORTH.

977
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,166
WENTWORTH?

978
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,969
THAT'S ALL, BARCLAY.

979
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,439
ANYTHING ELSE?

980
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,774
WELL, SIR. THE KHAN--
THAT IS, IF I MAY...

981
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:07,443
YES, OF COURSE.
GO ON.

982
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:10,713
WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, WE RAN
ACROSS A CARAVAN COMING
DOWN FROM THE PASS.

983
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,114
THERE WAS A HINDU MERCHANT.

984
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,617
HE'D JUST BEEN
TO VISIT THE SURISTANIS,

985
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,286
AND HE HAS IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT THE SURISTANIS ARE
PREPARING FOR AN ATTACK.

986
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:19,121
AN ATTACK?

987
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,322
YES, SIR.
ON CHUKOTI.

988
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,790
OH, COME,
COME, NOW, BARCLAY.

989
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,892
THE KHAN WOULDN'T DARE.
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

990
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,628
THAT'S ALL.

991
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,630
YES, SIR.

992
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:30,132
SOLDIERS...
OLD WOMEN, THAT'S WHAT.

993
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,134
I FEEL
THAT BARCLAY'S
INFORMATION

994
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,637
IS ACCURATE, SIR.

995
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,138
WHAT, YOU ALSO?

996
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,707
ALL RIGHT.
PRESUMING IT IS.

997
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,143
WHY THIS GARRISON?
WHY CHUKOTI?
ANSWER ME THAT, VICKERS.

998
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,646
THE KHAN'S
WISE ENOUGH
TO KNOW, SIR,

999
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,648
THAT AN ATTACK
ON CHUKOTI NOW

1000
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,650
WILL IGNITE
THE ENTIRE FRONTIER.

1001
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,318
WHY,
THE INFERNAL SCOUNDREL.

1002
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,121
THEN HE MUST KNOW
THE HOME GOVERNMENT'S
FEELINGS ABOUT A BORDER WAR.

OF NEGOTIATIONS

YOU'RE FIGHTING

MY DEAR MAJOR,
IS OVERWHELMING.

NOT AN ENGLISH PROVERB

THEN I TAKE IT
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO BE SAID.

01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,506
ON THE CONTRARY,

1260

IF WE ARE OPEN
AND HONEST
WITH ONE ANOTHER,

1261
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,277
THIS MATTER CAN BE
SETTLED REASONABLY.

1262
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,645
ANY SUGGESTION
YOU MAKE MUST
GUARANTEE THE SAFETY

1263

OF THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.

1264
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:14,549
THEN THE OBVIOUS
SOLUTION WOULD BE
AN EVACUATION.

1265
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:16,984
EVACUATION?
YOU MEAN SURRENDER?

1266
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:19,787

REASON TO SUPPOSE

1269
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,129

WILL HAVE TO LAY DOWN

1277
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,378

IMPOSSIBLE.

ARE ACCEPTABLE,

EXCEEDINGLY UNWISE
NOT TO--

GEOFFREY, WILL YOU
TAKE HIM A MESSAGE?

1506
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:40,200
WHY, YES.

1507
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,904
TELL HIM...

1508
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:46,907
THAT I THINK HIS BROTHER...

1509
01:30:46,909 --> 01:30:50,210
IS THE FINEST MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

1510
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,182
SIR CHARLES
MACEFIELD'S
COMPLIMENTS

1511
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:30,183
TO GENERAL SCOTT.

1512
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:31,585
THERE ARE
NO NEW ORDERS.

1513
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:34,354
SOON AS THE WAR
COUNCIL'S OVER,
I'LL NOTIFY HIM.

1514
01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:36,056
WE MUST ATTACK
SEBASTOPOL.

1515
01:31:36,058 --> 01:31:39,125
GENERAL CANROBERT'S ANXIETY
IS PERHAPS PROMPTED BY THE FACT

1516
01:31:39,127 --> 01:31:41,194
THAT OUR SUPPLIES
ARE RUNNING LOW.

1517
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:42,863
LORD RAGLAN
UNDERSTANDS
PERFECTLY.

1518
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:44,498
CAN'T YOU SEE,
LORD CARDIGAN,

1519
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,433
THE BALTIC FLEET
IS USELESS?

1520
01:31:46,435 --> 01:31:49,135
THE TURKISH FLEET,
I REGRET TO SAY,

1521
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:51,171
HAS BEEN DESTROYED
BY THE RUSSIANS
AT SINOPE.

1522
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:54,474
THE RECENT STORM HAS WRECKED
NOT ONLY THE RUSSIAN FLEET,

1523
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:57,077
BUT THE LARGEST
OF THE FRENCH MAN-OF-WAR.

1524
01:31:57,079 --> 01:31:59,713
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
OUR RESOURCES, GENERAL.

1525
01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:01,314
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

1526
01:32:01,316 --> 01:32:03,550
WE HAVE SEBASTOPOL
UNDER SIEGE,

1527
01:32:03,552 --> 01:32:06,319
AND OUR FORCES HAVE
THE RUSSIANS AT BAY,
SO TO SPEAK.

1528
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:07,854
BESIDES, SO FAR,

1529
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:11,825
NO REAL OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTACK SEBASTOPOL
HAS PRESENTED ITSELF.

1530
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,970
ALL RIGHT, CAPTAIN.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF IT.

1531
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:39,986
LORD RAGLAN
CAN'T BE DISTURBED

1532
01:32:39,988 --> 01:32:42,489
WHILE THE WAR COUNCIL'S
IN SESSION.

1533
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:44,491
TAKE IT UP WITH
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.

1534
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:45,992
YES, SIR.

1535
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:47,193
WAIT.

1536
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:58,605
ALL RIGHT. CARRY ON.

1537
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,041
YES, SIR.

1538
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:11,484
MY PLAN TO WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE

1539
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:13,987
IS PERFECTLY CLEAR
TO ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN.

1540
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:15,889
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ISSUE
THE ORDERS, SIR CHARLES.

1541
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:16,990
VERY GOOD.

1542
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:19,559
I THINK THAT'S ALL
WE HAVE TO DISCUSS.

1543
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,511
SOME PAPERS
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE, SIR.

1544
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:40,013
HMM?

1545
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:42,015
WELL, THESE
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.

1546
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,516
PRESENTLY WILL DO.

1547
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:46,086
SIT DOWN.
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE A DISPATCH.

1548
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:52,525
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
ARMY OF THE CRIMEA.

1549
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:54,027
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY,

1550
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:56,596
FIELD MARSHAL
THE EARL OF RAGLAN, K.C.B.,
COMMANDING...

1551
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,399
THE MAJOR GENERAL

1552
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:04,971
SIR BENJAMIN WARRENTON, K.C.B.,
NO. 1174.

1553
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:11,077
ON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,

1554
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:13,580
YOU WILL WITHDRAW
THE LIGHT BRIGADE

1555
01:34:13,582 --> 01:34:17,417
TO A POINT
3 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST

1556
01:34:17,419 --> 01:34:19,919
OF ITS PRESENT POSITION...

1557
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:21,488
BY ORDER.

1558
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:37,504
LIGHT BRIGADE'S
MOVING BACK, SIR?

1559
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:40,473
YES.
WHAT'S SURPRISING
ABOUT THAT?

1560
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:42,108
VOLONOFF COMMANDS
THE RUSSIAN
ARTILLERY POSITION

1561
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:44,411
ON THE HEIGHTS
ABOVE THE VALLEY
OF BALAKLAVA.

1562
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:46,579
SURAT KHAN'S
WITH HIM.

1563
01:34:46,581 --> 01:34:49,382
WE KNOW THAT.

1564
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,950
DON'T YOU THINK
THE MEN OF THE 27th,
THE MEN FROM CHUKOTI,

1565
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:53,219
OUGHT TO BE GIVEN
A CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM?

1566
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:54,954
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1567
01:34:54,956 --> 01:34:56,623
EVERY BRITISH SOLDIER
WOULD GIVE HIS LIFE

1568
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,591
TO AVENGE
THE CHUKOTI MASSACRE,

1569
01:34:58,593 --> 01:35:01,561
BUT AT THIS MOMENT,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1570
01:35:01,563 --> 01:35:03,463
MAY NEVER BE
ANOTHER CHANCE, SIR.

1571
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:04,931
YOU MUST KNOW
THAT THE RUSSIANS

1572
01:35:04,933 --> 01:35:07,667
HAVE THEIR STRONGEST BATTERIES
SITUATED ABOVE THE VALLEY.

1573
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:09,969
IT WOULD TAKE
AT LEAST FIVE REGIMENTS
FOR THE ASSAULT.

1574
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:12,038
OH, NO, VICKERS,
IT'S SUICIDE.

1575
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,941
THAT VALLEY,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IS A VALLEY OF DEATH.

1576
01:35:14,943 --> 01:35:16,810
IT WOULD BE
WORTH IT, SIR.

1577
01:35:16,812 --> 01:35:18,211
600 MEN ATTACKING
THE RUSSIAN CENTER

1578
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,713
WOULD KEEP
THE ENEMY OCCUPIED

1579
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:21,381
WHILE THE COMBINED
FRENCH, TURKISH,
BRITISH FORCES

1580
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,049
ATTACK SEBASTOPOL.

1581
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:27,020
SEBASTOPOL TAKEN,
THE CZAR MUST SUE
FOR PEACE.

1582
01:35:27,022 --> 01:35:30,857
YES. THE ENTIRE
CRIMEA SITUATION
HINGES ON SEBASTOPOL,

1583
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:34,194
BUT THIS IS NO TIME
TO CONSIDER PERSONAL
FEELINGS, VICKERS.

1584
01:35:34,196 --> 01:35:36,029
YOUR PLAN IS
ADMIRABLY DARING,

1585
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:37,297
BUT THAT'S JUST IT.

1586
01:35:37,299 --> 01:35:39,165
IT'S TOO WILD.

1587
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,438
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO DELIVER THIS ORDER
PERSONALLY

1588
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,174
TO THE COMMANDER
OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.

1589
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:50,043
IS THAT CLEAR?

1590
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:51,778
YES, SIR.

1591
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:26,933
WHY, WHAT'S UP, VICKERS?

1592
01:38:26,935 --> 01:38:28,468
WHAT? NOTHING.

1593
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:30,470
YOU DO LOOK RATHER ODD,
YOU KNOW.

1594
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:32,472
CONFOUND YOU, BENTHAM.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
WILL YOU?

1595
01:38:32,474 --> 01:38:35,375
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.

1596
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,634
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
THESE BATTLES

1597
01:39:01,636 --> 01:39:03,670
ARE THE FINEST
OF TWO AND A HALF MONTHS.

1598
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:05,204
WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF MEN,

1599
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:07,407
APART FROM THOSE WHO DIED
FROM THE COLD AND SICKNESS.

1600
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,876
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPERATIVE
THAT UNLESS--

1601
01:39:09,878 --> 01:39:11,711
ORDERS FROM GENERAL
HEADQUARTERS, SIR.

1602
01:39:11,713 --> 01:39:13,212
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN.

1603
01:39:13,214 --> 01:39:14,514
HIS EXCELLENCY'S
COMPLIMENTS.

1604
01:39:14,516 --> 01:39:16,582
THANK YOU.
WELL, HOW ARE THINGS
OVER AT HEADQUARTERS?

1605
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:18,584
THEY'VE BEEN
PRETTY DULL HERE.

1606
01:39:18,586 --> 01:39:20,053
I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR.

1607
01:39:20,055 --> 01:39:21,454
THAT'S FROM
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

1608
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:22,956
WELL, SIR.

1609
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:29,429
"UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ORDER,
THE LIGHT BRIGADE WILL ADVANCE

1610
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:32,131
AND TAKE THE ENEMY POSITION
ON BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS."

1611
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,300
IT'S COME AT LAST.

1612
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:35,935
YOU EXPECTED IT?

1613
01:39:35,937 --> 01:39:37,770
FOR WEEKS, VICKERS.
FOR WEEKS.

1614
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:39,872
SO YOU THOUGHT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS WERE
THE ONLY ONES IN THE KNOW,

1615
01:39:39,874 --> 01:39:41,641
BUT I, TOO, KNEW
THAT SURAT KHAN

1616
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:43,576
WAS WITH VOLONOFF
ON THE BALAKLAVA HEIGHTS.

1617
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:45,445
THE 27th--
THE MEN KNOW, SIR?

1618
01:39:45,447 --> 01:39:47,213
CERTAINLY NOT.
THERE'D BE NO HOLDING THEM.

1619
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:48,414
DO YOU MIND
IF I TELL THEM?

1620
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:49,615
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE COMING WITH US?

1621
01:39:49,617 --> 01:39:51,250
OF COURSE.
IT'S MY REGIMENT.

1622
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:54,420
BESIDES, THIS
IS MORE THAN JUST
A FIGHT FOR ME, SIR.

1623
01:39:54,422 --> 01:39:56,289
AND TO ME, TOO,
MY BOY.

1624
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:59,225
DO YOU THINK THAT I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO SLEEP SINCE
THAT AWFUL DAY AT CHUKOTI?

1625
01:39:59,227 --> 01:40:01,260
AND NOW, AT LAST...

1626
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:04,230
WOULD YOU MIND IF I
SPOKE TO MY BROTHER
HERE IN YOUR OFFICE?

1627
01:40:04,232 --> 01:40:05,732
CERTAINLY NOT.

1628
01:40:05,734 --> 01:40:07,233
ORDERLY...

1629
01:40:07,235 --> 01:40:09,168
GO TO
CAPTAIN VICKER'S BILLET

1630
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,970
AND REQUEST HIM
TO COME HERE AT ONCE.

1631
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,105
[MAN]
YES, SIR.

1632
01:40:12,107 --> 01:40:14,007
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
ACTION AT LAST.

1633
01:40:14,009 --> 01:40:17,410
COME WITH ME.
I TRUST ALL THE UNITS ARE
READY TO MOVE OUT AT ONCE.

1634
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:42,902
OH, I--I THOUGHT
SIR BENJAMIN SENT FOR ME.

1635
01:40:42,904 --> 01:40:46,105
NO. I SENT FOR YOU.

1636
01:40:46,107 --> 01:40:47,640
I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS DISPATCH
TO GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

1637
01:40:47,642 --> 01:40:49,242
AND WAIT THERE
UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS.

1638
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:51,344
WAIT AT
GENERAL HEADQUARTERS?

1639
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:54,113
BUT I'VE HEARD
THE REGIMENT'S
MOVING FORWARD.

1640
01:40:54,115 --> 01:40:55,615
IF I HAVE TO WAIT
AT GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,

1641
01:40:55,617 --> 01:40:57,183
I'LL BE OUT OF THE FIGHT
ALTOGETHER.

1642
01:40:57,185 --> 01:40:58,985
YOU'LL DELIVER IT
PERSONALLY TO
SIR CHARLES MACEFIELD.

1643
01:40:58,987 --> 01:41:00,887
YOU UNDERSTAND?

1644
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,889
I BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP ME OUT OF THIS
DELIBERATELY

1645
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:04,323
BECAUSE OF ELSA.

1646
01:41:04,325 --> 01:41:06,793
NO. NO. ELSA'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

1647
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:08,694
YOU'RE NOT
IN THE DIPLOMATIC
SERVICE NOW, YOU KNOW.

1648
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:10,763
YOU'RE
WITH YOUR REGIMENT
AT THE FRONT.

1649
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:12,698
YOU'LL OBEY MY ORDERS
IMMEDIATELY.

1650
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,834
IF I REFUSE?

1651
01:41:14,836 --> 01:41:17,203
YOU'LL BE
COURT-MARTIALED.

1652
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:24,343
I SEE--
DISGRACED EITHER WAY.

1653
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:27,680
VERY WELL.

1654
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:44,330
BUGLER, SOUND ASSEMBLY.

1655
01:42:12,826 --> 01:42:14,694
MEN OF THE 27th,

1656
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:16,329
SURAT KHAN IS ON THE FIELD

1657
01:42:16,331 --> 01:42:18,598
WITH THE OPPOSING
RUSSIAN FORCES,

1658
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,733
THE SAME SURAT KHAN
WHO MASSACRED

1659
01:42:20,735 --> 01:42:22,635
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
OF CHUKOTI.

1660
01:42:22,637 --> 01:42:25,104
OUR CHANCE HAS COME.

1661
01:42:25,106 --> 01:42:26,873
SHOW NO MERCY.

1662
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,941
LET NO POWER ON EARTH
STOP YOU.

1663
01:42:28,943 --> 01:42:30,576
PROVE TO THE WORLD

1664
01:42:30,578 --> 01:42:32,278
THAT NO MAN CAN KILL
WOMEN AND CHILDREN

1665
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,714
AND LIVE TO BOAST OF IT.

1666
01:42:34,716 --> 01:42:37,116
MEN OF THE 27th,

1667
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:40,453
OUR OBJECTIVE IS SURAT KHAN!

1668
01:42:40,455 --> 01:42:42,021
FORWARD!

1669
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:51,230
13th DRAGOONS,
