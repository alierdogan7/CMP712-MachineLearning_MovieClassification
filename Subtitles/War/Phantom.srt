it makes us invisible to active sonar

00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:47,584
I knew Markov would never
expect me to fight in the blind,

776
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:52,172
so I pulled into his wake.

777
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:55,717
But I never expected him
to reverse his engines, either.

to seal them inside.
