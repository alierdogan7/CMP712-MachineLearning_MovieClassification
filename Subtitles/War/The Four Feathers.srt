1
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,233
Afternoon, Parker.

2
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,734
Good afternoon, sir.

3
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,070
General Faversham
is waiting for you on the terrace.

4
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,655
Aye.

5
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,491
Dr. Sutton, sir.

6
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,536
You've had a long journey, Doctor.

7
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,581
Oh, it's worth a journey
to join old comrades.

8
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,125
- Are they all coming?
- Same crowd.

9
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,460
- A year older.
- Ah.

10
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,754
- Sit down. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

11
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,924
Well, what's the news from London?

12
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,384
Well, haven't you heard?

13
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,221
Gordon's dead.
Murdered in Khartoum.

14
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,724
That's no news to me.

15
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,895
I said that was going to happen years ago
when they first sent Gordon to Egypt.

16
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,314
He wasn't hard enough.

17
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,900
They wanted someone like you
out there.

18
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,444
Just what I was going to say myself.

19
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,530
First time for a hundred years
there hasn't been a Faversham in the army...

20
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,241
and look at the mess they make.

21
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,119
I'm too old, the boy's too young.

22
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,247
Me own fault for not marrying sooner.

23
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,874
You remember the boy.

24
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,209
He's 15 years old today.

25
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,796
I'm going to let him dine with us tonight.

26
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,258
- Oh, good.
- I don't mind telling you, I'm worried about him.

27
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,218
- Oh?
- I can't understand the boy.

28
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,596
I send him to the best
army school in England...

29
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,599
spend half me time telling him
about his famous ancestors...

30
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,059
and what do you think?

31
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,311
I found him this morning
reading a poetry book!

32
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
Shelley, of all people!

33
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,901
So I want you to help me
lick this boy into shape and make him hard.

34
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,488
[Men Chattering]

35
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,157
Gentlemen, to Crimea!

36
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,159
- Ah.
- Old comrades.

37
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,827
[All Responding]
Old comrades!

38
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,080
- Arnold!
- Raglan!

39
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,500
- Yes.
- [Man Clearing Throat]

40
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,043
Crimea, by Jove.

41
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,798
Ah, war was war in those days
and men were men.

42
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,675
No room for weaklings.

43
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,176
Balaclava, for instance.

44
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,262
Here. You fellows
remember the positions.

45
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,516
Now here, these nuts...

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,810
were the Russians.

47
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:14,772
Guns, guns, guns.

48
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,525
On the right,
the British infantry.

49
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,738
The thin red line.
There was the commander in chief.

50
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,534
And here was l...

51
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,953
at the head of the old 68th.

52
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,373
The right was impossible.
The left was blocked.

53
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,834
Behind us was the commander in chief.

54
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,294
I realized the position in a flash.

55
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,964
I said, "The 68th will move forward."

56
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,426
Immediately one of my subalterns
came to me shaking.

57
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,720
Absolutely shaking!

58
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,888
I said, "What's wrong, Travers?"

59
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,600
Said, "I'm afraid to face those guns, sir."

60
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,770
I said, "Would you rather face me?"

61
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,940
Hmph! He took one look at my face
and off he went.

62
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,901
Ten minutes later he was shot to pieces
at the head of his men.

63
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,653
As a soldier should be, eh?

64
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,655
[Faversham]
I quite agree with you, General.

65
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,535
I can tolerate nerves before a battle,
but I can't stand cowardice.

66
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,080
I remember a soldier at Inkerman
when a Cossack charged down on him.

67
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,877
I saw a man raise his musket,
fumble with his trigger, then turn and run.

68
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,337
The Cossack's lance went in
at the back of his neck...

69
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,089
and came out in his throat.

70
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,134
Best thing that could have happened to him.
Do you remember Wilmington?

71
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,845
- Wilmington?
- Fine old service family.

72
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,805
Father killed at Inkerman...

73
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,434
grandfather blown up under Nelson
and an uncle scalped by Indians.

74
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,436
Oh, splendid record. Splendid.

75
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,438
- [Men Murmuring Agreement]
- [Faversham] What happened?

76
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:41,025
Well, the general ordered him
to gallop through the lines with a message.

77
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,695
Paralyzed with funk.
Couldn't move.

78
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,989
General sent his adjutant.

79
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,991
Killed before he'd gone 50 yards.

80
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,744
Sent his A.D.C.- head blown off.

81
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,289
Then he went through with
the message himself- lost his arm.

82
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,958
- Ruined his cricket.
- Oh, yes, I remember now.

83
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,377
He disgraced his family.

84
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,338
His father disowned him.

85
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,299
Hung about for a year or two,
then blew his brains out.

86
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,135
Ah, he had the courage
to blow his brains out.

87
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,056
Courage? [Scoffs]
Last spark of decency, that's all.

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,683
There's no place in England
for a coward.

89
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,606
Harry.

90
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,818
Past 11:00.
Time you were in your bed.

91
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,779
No, no, no.
Sit you down, my boy. Sit you down.

92
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,989
It's the boy's birthday,
and we've not drunk his health!

93
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,284
- Go ahead, General.
- A toast to Harry!

94
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,246
And may he prove
the bravest of the Favershams.

95
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,414
- To Harry!
- [All] Harry!

96

[Men Clearing Throats]

97
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,967
- Thank you.
- That's our boy. [Chuckles]

98
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,681
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Harry.

99
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,016
- Good night, gentlemen.
- [All Responding]

100
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,852
- Fine boy.
- Yes.

[Chattering]

102
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,686
Harry.

103
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,817
You don't remember me.

104
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,362
I remember you though,
when you were about so long.

105
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,324
I was a doctor in your father's regiment
in the Crimea.

106
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,577
I knew your mother too, Harry.
She was my friend.

107
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,496
I'd like you to think of me
as your friend too.

108
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,917
If ever you should need me,
here's my card.

109
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:08,589
I'm not much use to anybody nowadays,
but if ever you feel the need, write to me.

110
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,424
Come and see me.

111
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,677
That's very kind of you, sir.
Thank you.

112
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,306
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Harry.

116

Stand at ease!

117
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,645
Ten years ago...

118
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,315
General Gordon
was murdered in Khartoum...

119
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,318
and the British army
was withdrawn into Egypt...

120
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,153
without punishing the crime.

121
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,448
Today the Royal North Surrey Regiment...

122
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,286
is under orders to join
Sir Herbert Kitchener's Anglo-Egyptian army...

123
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,288
for the reconquest of the Sudan!

124
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,916
[Cheering]

125
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,295
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- [Cheering, Chattering]

126
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,797
- Ooh, hello.
- Well, what's Egypt like, John?

127
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,799
Principally, sand, sweat and sunstroke.

128
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,676
- Ooh, lovely! When do we start?
- Can't say.

129
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,678
- Not before next Thursday.
- Heavens no.

130
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,680
Took them 10 years
to make up their minds.

131
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,100
- We'll be lucky if we start in a month.
- Splendid. Then I can give you these.

132
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,978
Mr. Harry Faversham,
Captain John Durrance...

133
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,230
and one for Fat Face Willoughby.

134
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,066
- Ooh, what's all this?
- An invitation to the Burroughs family bean feast.

135
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,610
Complete with regimental string band,
strawberry ices...

136
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,612
and a performing troupe of hired waiters.

137
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,614
[Chuckles]
Yes, my sister's coming of age.

138
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,367
Ethne is 21 next Thursday,
so Father is letting himself go.

139
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,577
- Champagne?
- Gallons!

140
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,871
- Oysters?
- Oysters in June? Don't be a fool.

141
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,207
I had 'em at my coming out.
I had the sense to be born in March.

142
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,710
- [Laughs]
- [Laughs, Snorts]

143
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,378
[Burroughs]
Father's going to be terrific.

144
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,381
He's given four speeches already,
and he's been rehearsing them in the bathroom.

145
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,883
[Laughs]

146
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,386
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen
and officers of my old regiment...

147
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,598
this is an occasion
for double rejoicing.

148
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,060
I am proud to announce
not only my daughter's coming of age...

149
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:31,106
but also her engagement to the son
of my old comrade in arms...

150
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,486
Mr. Harry Faversham
of the Royal North Surrey Regiment."

151
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,911
What, him?

152
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,081
- Our own Harry Faversham.
- Oh, I say, this is very sudden.

153
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,083
They've been signaling for it
for months.

154
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,543
- Good luck, Harry.
- Thanks.

155
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,420
Good luck, Harry.

156
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,047
Thanks, John.

157
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,092
What about this Egypt business?
You can't take her with you, you know.

158
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,928
When the Dervishes catch a white man,
they cut his nose off...

159
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,930
and hang him up by the toes.

160
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,766
Ooh, disgusting business.
All the money falling out of your pockets.

161
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,684
I'll see you at dinner.

162
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,693
Ooh.
Did I frighten the poor lad?

163
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,529
Shouldn't be surprised.

164
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,032
I don't know what's come over the lad.
Can't take a joke.

165
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,369
Never takes a drink.
Moons about all day.

166
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,788
Reads poetry all night.

167
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,207
If that's love, give me indigestion.

168
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,875
[Laughs]

169
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,420
Oh. Uh, time to get changed.

170
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,714
- So long.
- So long.

- That's all right, Peter.

John, I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
Is this your dance going on?

- It's just started.

- It's a polka.

- Don't you like a polka?
- A bit jerky, isn't it?

Rather like saying "good-bye"

- There's no need to be sorry.

- It's terribly hard to explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

points why I love Mr. "A,"
points why I don't love Mr. "B."

Oh, I put down

What's happened? Peter left last night.
Father went with him to see you all off.

348
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,902
They've canceled it.
You're not going after all?

349
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,488
They've gone.

350
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,865
The regiment sailed this morning.

351
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,369
- But I haven't gone with them.
- I don't understand.

352
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,330
We've discussed it so often -

353
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,750
the futility of this idiotic
Egyptian adventure...

354
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,418
the madness of it all...

355
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,713
the ghastly waste of time
that we can never have again.

356
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,426
- What have you done, Harry?
- I've resigned my commission.

357
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,429
I should have done it sooner.

358
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,431

359
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,934
It's released me
from the life of an impostor.

00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,521
That's all a man is when he fails
to be true to the things he believes in.

361
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,274
I believe in our happiness.

362
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:48,361
I believe in the work to be done here
to save an estate that's near to ruin...

363
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,613
to save all those people
who've been neglected by my family...

364
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:54,284

glory in China, glory in Africa.

00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,573
Well, they had a fine send-off, Ethne.

374
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,493
I went aboard and had lunch with them
before they sailed.

375
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,580
Peter has a cabin
with John Durrance and Willoughby.

376
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,208
I'm glad the three boys
are going to be together.

377
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,709
- Father, I -
- Yes.

378
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:30,171
It was a wonderful sight,
the vessel steaming out into the channel...

379
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,298
and all those men cheering and -

380
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,634
May I speak to you a moment, sir?

381
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,495
It was cruel to send these.

382
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,085
Cruel, but just.

383
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,255
That's what you think, isn't it?

384
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:17,302
You needn't tell me, Ethne.
I can see it quite clearly in your eyes.

385
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,847
We agreed always
to be honest with each other, Harry...

386
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,182
to keep no secret from each other.

387
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,102
When you did this...

388
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,356
did you believe
that I should be proud of you?

389
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,026
I thought you'd understand.

390
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,405
We've so often talked of these things
and we've always understood each other.

391
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:42,410
I know, Harry. We've talked and we've dreamed
of things we'd do if we were free.

392
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:48,041
Some people are born free. They can do what
they like without concern for consequences.

393
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,794
But you were not born free, Harry,
and nor was l.

394
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,547
We were born into a tradition...

395
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,051
a code which we must obey
even if we do not believe.

396
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,886
And we must obey it, Harry...

397
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,599
because the pride and happiness of everyone
surrounding us depends upon our obedience.

398
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,852
I quite understand.

399
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,287

if that's the whole truth...

I was told a ghastly story when I was a boy,
and you were there when it was told.

An officer who failed to carry a message
because he was paralyzed with fear.

Many a man is haunted by some fear.

452
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,079
With me it was more than fear.
My father despised me.

453
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,081
He believed me to be a coward.

454
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,417
His belief turned fear into reality.

455
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,962
I knew that if ever fate put me in the same position,
I should behave like that man...

I am a coward, Doctor.

459
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,023
If I'd been anything but a soldier, I might have
lived my whole life and concealed it.

460
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,651
But to be a soldier and a coward
is to be an impostor...

461
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,737

was closing in round me...

just as it closed round that other man.

465
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,874

466
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:26,253
I believed in all the reasons I gave
for shirking my job.

467
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,714
I deceived myself.

468
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,966
But I didn't deceive my friends.

469
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,513
The men who sent me these feathers
knew me better than I knew myself.

470
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,976

is more than a coward. He's a fool as well.

If I thought you were a coward, Harry...

474
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,072
I should take this with me...

fight you for it if necessary.

476
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,663
It's because I know you've no intention
of using it on yourself...

477
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,498
that I leave it here.

00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,386
Yes, Doctor,
there is something you can do.

00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,430
Yes?

I should like you to go to Ethne...

00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,617
that once revolted against the Khalifa.

508
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,120
And in revenge the Khalifa branded them,
cut out their tongues from their heads...

509
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,664
and made them outcasts.

510
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,668
- You know the brand?
- All men know the brand of the Sangali.

511
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,003
Then you understand
the reason of my visit, Doctor.

512
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,173
But, my dear young man,
you will miss your tongue in many ways.

513
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:19,343
I will keep my tongue.
No one will look for it if I'm branded.

514
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,554
I can stain your skin...

515
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:25,391
but I cannot imitate a scar
that would escape detection.

516
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,142
That I understand.

517
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,979
Is your mission then
of such importance?

518
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,982
May I stay in your house
until the wound is healed?

Ah, Durrance.

524
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,772
- Told to report, sir.
- Kitchener's been talking to me.

525
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,649
You know what the situation is.

526
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,652
The main army and provision ships
must get up the Nile.

527
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,655
It's the only feasible route
up country towards Omdurman.

528
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,949
But the river's blocked
by the Khalifa's army...

529
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,619
and our ships
can't get through the gorge.

530
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:31,457
Now, the Khalifa must be drawn away,
by some sort of bluff, into the desert.

531
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,750
Yes, sir.

532
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,002
Now, if one of our brigades
appeared on his flank...

533
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,338
he'd have to turn away and face it.

534
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,215
- That would leave the river unguarded.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,470
Now, General Kitchener can't spare
a regiment, much less a brigade...

536
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,472
but he can spare a company.

537
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,475

551
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,761
That was a very bad performance,
Mr. Faversham.

552
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:11,765
No true Sangali would enter a room
with the self-assurance of an Englishman.

553
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:16,186
- Why was that fellow in such a funk?
- He was terrified you might betray him.

554

- Oh, I see.
- But for myself I have no such fears.

555
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,358
But I must admit I should feel
a little more comfortable...

556
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:25,195
if you would tell me frankly why all this -
the wandering, the disguise.

557
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,241
In England four people
gave me a white feather apiece.

558
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:33,370
- They've got to take them back.
- Oh, a mad race, the English.

559
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,456
No, not so mad.

560
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,083
In England, the white feather
is the mark of a coward.

561
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,169
Ah, I see. Then why worry?

562

I have been a coward,
and I wasn't happy.

565
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,928
Tell me, did he bring any news?

566
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,973
Yes. He says a North Surrey regiment
has left Abu Hamid.

567
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,434
By crossing the desert
you could pick them up at the Nile...

568
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,436
perhaps near the 5th Cataract.

569

Part of Kitchener's army
is going up the river in boats.

570
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,192

852

Quite sure.

floats me down the Nile...

and then -

Now, here's the extraordinary part.

Having done enough to win
the Victoria Cross...

908
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,881
he lays me down outside the camp
and calmly begins to rob me.

Nothing strange in that.
Just Eastern business mentality.

and a few storekeepers, and that's about all.

They all understand one or the other.

Then you can do a great service
to yourself and to all these people.

Will you tell them that I have brought
the means of setting them free?

01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:10,733
Good old Surreys.

1188
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:14,070
"...was privileged to witness the most dramatic
and astonishing scene in this inspiring day."

1189
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:15,321
Hmm.

1190
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:17,448
"During the battle, the prisoners
in the Omdurman dungeons...

1191
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:20,118
overwhelmed their guards,
captured the arsenal and held it...

1192
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:22,704
- until relieved by Anglo-Egyptian troops."
- Bravo!

1193
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,581
"The achievement was led and inspired...

1194
01:48:24,665 --> 01:48:27,417
by two British officers
of the Royal North Surrey Regiment...

1195
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:31,045
captured in the fight at Gakdul Wells,
Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby."

1196
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,881
Peter! Alive!

1197
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:36,968
And good old Willoughby!
Isn't that splendid!

1198
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:40,388
- What's the time?
- The time? It's just on 7:00.

1199
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,931
- We'll go tonight.
- What?

1200
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:44,392
We'll be the first to tell Ethne
and the old man.

1201
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:47,478
Ha! He'll be crazy
with excitement about this!

1202
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:51,232
- Joe! Joe!
- Yes, sir?

1203
01:48:51,317 --> 01:48:55,653
Pack my bag. Send a message round to
Dr. Sutton's house to send his bag round here.

1204
01:48:55,738 --> 01:48:58,072
We're going to General Burroughs's.
The 8:15 from Paddington.

1205
01:48:58,157 --> 01:49:00,491
Oh, but I've got an important appointment
in the morning, John.

1206
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:02,076
- And, Joe!
- Yes, sir?

1207
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,954
Tell Dr. Sutton's man to cancel
all his appointments for tomorrow.

1208
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:07,457
Oh, but Ethne and the general
will know before we get there.

1209
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:10,376
They won't. They never get the evening papers
in that place until the morning.

1210
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:12,754
[Chuckling]
We'll just walk in and break the news.

1211
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:15,048
And the War Office
is certain to send a telegram.

1212
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:18,092
You've always got some confoundedly
cold-blooded reason for doing nothing.

1213
01:49:18,177 --> 01:49:19,928
Anyway, we'll be the first
to congratulate them.

1214
01:49:20,012 --> 01:49:21,638
Don't you realize what this means?

1215
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:24,557
Peter alive, and done a grand job of work
into the bargain.

1216
01:49:24,642 --> 01:49:27,268
- Is there any more? Read that last bit again.
- Huh?

1217
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,979
- "Lieutenants Burroughs and Willoughby'-
- Hmm.

1218
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:32,565
"...whose release from prison
was due to an act of heroism...

1219
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:35,401
described to me personally
by Lieutenant Burroughs.

1220
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:39,781
A man posing as a dumb Sangali native
gained entrance to the prison...

1221
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:41,950
with means of cutting the chains
of the captives.

1222
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:44,702
He suffered torture
and faced death to do so...

1223
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:47,455
because in reality,
he was until recently...

1224
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:50,583
an officer of their own regiment."

1225
01:49:50,668 --> 01:49:52,877
Lieutenant Faversham.

1226
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:15,942
But why should he try to rob me?

1227
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:27,996
- Doctor.
- Yes, John?

1228
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,581
There's some notepaper on my desk there.

1229
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,667
I want you to write a letter for me.

1230
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:37,380
I'm ready, John.

1231
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,632
To Ethne Burroughs.

1232
01:50:39,717 --> 01:50:41,384
Dear Ethne...

1233
01:50:42,511 --> 01:50:44,512
I've just had some splendid news.

1234
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:48,266
I've been to a famous German eye doctor...

1235
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:51,477
and my sight can be restored.

1236
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:54,147
Got that?

1237
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:57,358
I've got that, John.

1238
01:50:57,443 --> 01:51:00,570
It means a long course of treatment
in Germany...

1239
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:02,655
and I leave tomorrow.

1240
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:07,535
When I can see again,
I shall return to the army...

1241
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:11,831
with the happy memory...

1242
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:14,167
of all you have done...

1243
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:16,627
to help me through.

1244
01:51:16,712 --> 01:51:18,838
I'll sign it myself.

1245
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:24,177
And add a postscript.

1246
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:27,055
PS:

1247
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:30,808
Just heard the splendid news
of Peter and Willoughby...

1248
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:33,978
and Harry Faversham.

1249
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:38,066
I enclose a little souvenir
of a journey through the desert...

1250
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:40,485
with a dumb Sangali native.

1251
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:45,073
If you'll give him the chance
that he deserves...

1252
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:47,617
you'll find he's not...

1253
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,827
as mute...

1254
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:51,913
as I thought he was.

1255
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:55,083
That's all.

1256
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:56,793
[Joe]
Your bags are packed, sir.

1257
01:51:56,877 --> 01:51:59,212
There's just time for a bite of dinner
if you hurry.

1258
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:02,799
All right, Joe.
We're not going after all.

1259
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:06,511
I -

1260
01:52:07,513 --> 01:52:11,641
I still say the army of today
is soft compared with our day.

1261
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:13,935
Soft! That's your trouble.

1262
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:15,937
Still, you did your best...

1263
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:18,689
and as Harry has made you two young rascals
take your feathers back...

1264
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:21,818
well, he'd better marry the girl
and have done with it, eh, Doc, hmm?

1265
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:24,946
It's not as easy as all that.
There's my feather too.

1266
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,282
What deed of reckless daring
are you going to do...

1267
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:30,660
to make me take back my feather?

1268
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:32,412
Must l?

1269
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:34,956
Deeds of reckless twaddle.

1270
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,458
Stuff and nonsense.
No such thing nowadays.

1271
01:52:37,543 --> 01:52:40,837
All you boys had to do
was deal with Fuzzy-Wuzzy.

1272
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:42,922
But the Crimea was different.

1273
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:44,966
War was war in those days.

1274
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,759
No room for weaklings.

1275
01:52:46,844 --> 01:52:49,554
- Take Balaclava, for instance.
- [Dr. Sutton] Ah.

1276
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:52,932
Of course, you fellows wouldn't
remember the position, but it was this -

1277
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:54,684
Ah, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1278
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:56,769
Here were the Russians.

1279
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:59,063
Guns. Guns. Guns.

1280
01:52:59,148 --> 01:53:02,191
On the right, the British infantry.

1281
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:04,944
One moment, sir.

1282
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:08,281
Your famous account of Balaclava's
not accurate, you know.

1283
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,576
- Not -
- Not accurate, sir.

1284
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,495
Not accurate?

1285
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:17,665
No, sir.
Let me recall the position.

1286
01:53:17,749 --> 01:53:20,418
Out of the way, Peter.

1287
01:53:20,502 --> 01:53:22,670
Here are the Russians,
behind the walnuts.

1288
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:24,672
Guns. Guns. Guns.

1289
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:27,800
Here's the British Infantry.

1290
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:29,802
The thin red line.

1291
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:33,347
Here's the commander in chief.

1292
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:36,434
And here are you...

1293
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:40,021
at the head of the old 68th, correct?

1294
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,148
Absolutely.

1295
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:45,026
You were riding a horse called Caesar,
which my father sold you...

1296
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:48,029
because, fine horseman though he was,
he could never hold him himself.

1297
01:53:49,364 --> 01:53:51,532
Quite right. Quite right.
[Chuckles]

1298
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:53,534
Then, according to your story, you said...

1299
01:53:53,619 --> 01:53:55,536
"The 68th will move forward."

1300
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:58,164
Quite right. Quite right.

1301
01:53:58,248 --> 01:53:59,999
Yes, sir.
The trouble is, you never said it.

1302
01:54:01,126 --> 01:54:03,544
- Ne -
- You never said it, sir.

1303
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:08,758
- Never said it?
- No, sir. You never had time.

1304
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,427
At that moment,
my father told me, Caesar -

1305
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:13,971
uh, Caesar - Caesar...

1306
01:54:15,807 --> 01:54:18,184
startled by a stray bullet,
took the bit between his teeth...

1307
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:19,894
and dashed straight
at the Russian lines.

1308
01:54:19,978 --> 01:54:22,104
Away went Caesar, away went you,
away went the 68th...

1309
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:24,357
away went the commander in chief,
away went everybody...

1310
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:27,693
and another magnificent mistake was added
to an already magnificent record.

1311
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:30,071
But nobody ever said,
"The 68th will move forward."

1312
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,366
Unless it was the horse.

1313
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:35,409
Come on, sir. Own up.

1314
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:39,372
Well, well, well, well, after all these years, it's
rather difficult to remember all the details...

1315
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:41,541
but... confound the boy!

1316
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,085
I shall never be able
to tell that story again!

1317
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:46,170
- [Laughter]
- Ethne, your feather.
