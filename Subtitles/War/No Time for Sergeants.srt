00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:46,346
How long have you been a sergeant?

664
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,690
- Well, sir, I... Ahem.
- Speak up.

665
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,358
Sixteen years, sir.

666
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,621
And how long do you expect
to remain a sergeant?

667
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,121
Twelve years.

668
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,234
You will remain a sergeant
exactly one week. One week.

669
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:04,371
Unless this man completes
the entire classification process...

670
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:07,530
...and is shipped out with the group
he came in with. Understand?

671
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,438
Unless this man is out of here
by the end of the week...

672
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,877
...you will not be in charge of this barracks,
you will not be a sergeant...

673
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,008
...you will in all probability
be a permanent latrine orderly.

674
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,984
PLO.

675
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:26,655
This is not your fault, private.

676
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:29,187
You've done a fine job.

677
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,467
I have never seen such a clean latrine
in my entire career.

678
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:35,960
Thank you, sir.

679
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:41,834
It was my aim to get it just as clean
as that operating room...

680
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:45,240
...where they're fixing
to cut out your heart!

681
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,351
You forgot to ask him
about the transfers.

682
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,053
What happened? What did you do it for?

683
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,686
Heck, I couldn't see no sense
in me getting all the credit.

684
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,534
We've gotta get you classified right away.
We gotta get you out of here.

685
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,733
You don't want me around no more?
I thought we was buddies.

686
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:18,100
It ain't what I want,
it's what the captain wants.

687
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,270
Now, we gotta get you classified
in a hurry.

688
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,315
You're gonna have to take tests and you're
going to have to talk to a lot of people.

689
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:27,249
And you're going to have to work
real hard.

690
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,588
Will it help Ben and me
get them transfers?

691
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:35,252
Well, I guarantee you, wherever you go,
they'll bust a gut to get you transferred.

692
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,229
Well, I'll work hard all right,
but I don't know.

693
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,130
The last test I took
was close on to five years ago...

694
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,066
...and that was one of them tests...

695
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:46,763
...where you try this fella's toothpaste
for 10 days...

696
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,909
...and see if your teeth don't get brighter.

697
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:52,245
And I failed.

698
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,612
You been admiring this watch of mine,
haven't you?

699
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:58,946
I sure have, sergeant.
That there's the prettiest watch I ever seen.

700
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,452
You get shipped out of here
by Saturday morning like the captain said...

701
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:04,022
...and it's yours.

702
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:05,590
- Mine?
- Yours.

703
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,887
Golly.

704
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,588
- Now you'll work real hard, right?
- Right.

705
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,528
- And not waste any time?
- No, sir.

706
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:14,725
Good boy.

707
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,462
Now first thing Monday morning,
we start classification.

708
00:44:17,638 --> 00:44:21,130
You stay right here around the barracks
and get a lot of rest...

709
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:24,209
...and relax your head.

710
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:30,044
I'm going down to the testing area
and see if I can borrow some of the tests.

711
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:31,912
Okay.

712
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:36,955
Tell them I'll give them back
just like I did the toothpaste.

713
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:46,625
WILL: <i>This place where they give us</i>
<i>the tests was really something.</i>

714
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,201
<i>They had this great big building,</i>
<i>full of doctors, nurses and officers.</i>

715
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,375
<i>All of them walking in and out</i>
<i>and around real quickety-quick...</i>

716
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,511
<i>... and not smiling at nobody.</i>

717
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:01,773
<i>And then there was this place</i>
<i>something like a schoolroom...</i>

718
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,009
<i>... where they give us</i>
<i>the tests we had to write out.</i>

719
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:07,380
Time's up, pal.

720
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:18,062
It was right friendly of you
to wait for me.

721
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,961
Thank you.

722
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:25,261
- How'd you think you did, Will?
- Well, them printed tests they give us...

723
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:28,806
...they was exactly like the ones
that you borrowed...

724
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:32,273
Only what?

725
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:35,347
Only you spent so much time
drumming the answers into me...

726
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:40,010
...we ought to have spent a little more
on the questions they joint up with.

727
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:49,156
Now, you just sit right down here
and wait.

728
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:10,876
Come on, Will, the corporal's waiting.

729
00:46:17,391 --> 00:46:20,588
Here he is, corporal.
Awfully sorry to keep you waiting.

730
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:29,258
What we do here, private,
is to evaluate your manual dexterity...

731
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:33,736
...on a time scale
in relation to digital visual coordination.

732
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:37,240
Two irregular steel links
which can be interconnected thusly.

733
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:40,141
I separate them, I join them.

734
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:42,544
It will be your task,
when I give the signal...

735
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,617
...to place the two links
in an interconnected relationship...

736
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:48,254
...I have just demonstrated.

737
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:56,194
Uh...

738
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:57,959
I put them together?

739
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,435
That's right, you put them together.

740
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:05,094
I'll time you
and three minutes is passing.

741
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:08,571
Now, whatever you do,
don't get nervous.

742
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:12,144
Ready. Go.

743
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,011
There you go.

744
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,987
Attaboy.

745
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,387
- Put them together.
- Sergeant, please.

746
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:27,686
Nobody ever does this
in less than two minutes.

747
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:29,920
You're not even supposed to be in here.

748
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,464
This is a special case. He has to go out
with the group he came in with.

749
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:36,262
- It's is a very difficult test.
- I couldn't do it myself.

750
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,200
- What are you talking about?
- I want you to get out of here.

751
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:42,604
- I'd just like to see you try to do it.
- This is my department.

752
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,937
- He's my department.
- That's my door. Get out.

753
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,012
- Get out right this minute.
- Throw me out.

754
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:49,444
You're not supposed to be here.
This is my watch...

755
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,084
- All right, then watch your watch...
- I'm done.

756
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:53,276
Stop the watch.

757
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:59,690
- Look. Look at that.
- He put them together, didn't he?

758
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:03,424
Sergeant! Sergeant!

759
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:07,055
What's the fuss about? You said,
"Put them together," he put them together.

760
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:10,328
Look what he did, for Pete's sake.
How am I gonna mark him on that?

761
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:13,598
You're supposed to be grading him on this.
Can't you do that?

762
00:48:13,774 --> 00:48:17,107
I'm supposed to mark it down
whether they put it back together or not...

763
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,872
...and there ain't supposed to be
but one way of doing it and he didn't do it.

764
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:23,073
How you gonna mark him
on a thing like that?

765
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,549
Who do you think's gonna pay for these?
Sixteen dollars, they cost.

766
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,711
- lf you think I'm gonna pay $ 16...
- Corporal!

767
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:29,913
Sixteen lousy dollars!

768
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,582
Corporal, I'll be glad to pay
the 16 lousy dollars.

769
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,489
- You will?
- lf he passed the test.

770
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,426
He did it wrong.
He was supposed to do it a certain way.

771
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,591
Will, will you step outside
for a minute, have a smoke.

772
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:48,136
Now, corporal,
let's look at this thing logically.

773
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:51,243
You need money
and I need him to pass the test.

774
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:55,279
But he did do it completely wrong.

775
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,751
- Ben?
- Will.

776
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,447
[CHUCKLES]

777
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:07,485
I ain't seen you all day.
You been in there classifying?

778
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:09,652
- Yeah.
- Me too. Find out where you're going?

779
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,889
Sergeant King says
maybe gunnery school.

780
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:14,329
That's where I'm going too
if I pass the eye test.

781
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:17,299
- How about that?
- Yeah, how about that?

782
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:21,202
Oh, Ben, you ain't still sad
about not being in the infantry?

783
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,206
The captain didn't even read my letter.

784
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,572
And that plan of yours
sure didn't work so good.

785
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:28,214
I tried to ask the psychiatrist
if he could fix me up.

786
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,680
- Yeah, what'd he say?
- He didn't say nothing.

787
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:32,944
I don't think he understands so good.

788
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,254
I'm just stuck in the Air Force, that's all.

789
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:40,454
Hey, Ben, maybe it's the Air Force
that's the real fighters...

790
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:42,458
...and the infantry's just the helpers.

791
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:43,653
Never.

792
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,328
Well, Ben, all you can do
is look at it that way.

793
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,401
No. Wait'll my brothers find out. Airman.

794
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:51,832
Private.

795
00:49:52,005 --> 00:49:54,838
What kind of rowdydow is this?
Pick up that cap.

796
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:56,032
Yes, sir.

797
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:59,007
- Is that a way to treat government property?
- No, sir, ma'am.

798
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:01,943
We're excited because we're
maybe going to the same school.

799
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:04,310
That's no excuse for...

800
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:14,289
What's the matter with this one?

801
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:18,762
- Have you been drinking?
- No, no, sir.

802
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,162
Get at attention, Will.

803
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,700
We're sending this to school?

804
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:28,799
Yes, sir, ma'am. If he passes the eye test,
he'll be going to gunnery school.

805
00:50:29,409 --> 00:50:32,139
As what? A target?

806
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,607
No, sir, ma'am.

807
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:38,283
Let's have no more rowdydow, understand?
No more.

808
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,852
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

809
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,529
What's the matter with you, anyhow?

810
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:01,902
Don't you know enough
to come to attention and salute an officer?

811
00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:04,033
- She was a woman.
- Sure she was.

812
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:06,406
Ain't you ever heard
of the Women's Air Force?

813
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,140
You mean they got one too?

814
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:11,674
Sure.

815
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:14,910
- Against ours?
- No, Will. They're with us.

816
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:16,885
They're with us 100 percent.

817
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:19,116
- We got to salute them?
- The officers, we do.

818
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:22,261
Didn't you hear that lecture
about military courtesy?

819
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:25,830
I'll be dogged.
I never heard of saluting no woman before.

820
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,864
She ain't a woman, she's a captain.

821
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,798
I seen a captain there
so I come to attention and saluted.

822
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:31,995
A captain, that's all.

823
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,663
- A woman captain.
- A "captain" captain.

824
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,537
By dog,
don't you understand nothing, Will?

825
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:40,236
When you're in uniform,
you ain't supposed to notice...

826
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:42,677
...whether a person is a man or a woman
or what.

827
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,910
A captain's a captain, a major's a major
and a general's a general.

828
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:52,484
Ben, you mean to tell me that you
didn't notice that she was a woman?

829
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:55,253
A captain, that's all I seen.

830
00:51:55,428 --> 00:51:59,159
Well, dog it, Ben,
I knew she was a woman right off.

831
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,396
Honest, Will, sometimes I wonder
how come they took you in the draft at all.

832
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:06,805
Come on, Will.

833
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:09,032
You too, Whitledge.

834
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:23,722
Well, Will, it looks like you're just liable
to get classified after all.

835
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,326
Just shows you
what the Air Force has come down to.

836
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:30,657
- This the fella you want? Whitledge?
- Yeah.

837
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:32,958
Psychiatrist says
he has a secondary anxiety...

838
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:36,830
...with inferiority
and systematized delusions of persecution.

839
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:38,764
I ain't surprised.

840
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:42,340
Recommends he be considered
to be transferred to the infantry.

841
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:44,140
The infantry?

842
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:46,973
Don't get excited.
He didn't say you have to.

843
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:51,447
Well, yeah, but that's what
Ben's always been wanting, corporal.

844
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:55,987
- Just you tell me what I have to do.
- Well, here. Fill this out.

845
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:59,091
When he's finished, buck it through
to the colonel for approval.

846
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,886
If he's crazy enough to want it.

847
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:02,824
How about that, Ben? You made it.

848
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:04,896
Just wait'll my brothers hear about this.

849
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:08,091
- Stockdale?
- Yeah.

850
00:53:10,904 --> 00:53:13,338
Okay, psychiatrist.

851
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:15,371
Oh, Lord, psychiatrist.

852
00:53:16,843 --> 00:53:18,868
Now, Will, listen carefully.

853
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:23,580
The psychiatrist test is one
where I couldn't get copies of questions...

854
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,012
...because there ain't any.

855
00:53:25,185 --> 00:53:27,949
The doctor asks you
whatever happens to pop into his head.

856
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,989
- So keep your wits about you.
- I'll try.

857
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:33,750
Hey. Hey.

858
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:37,488
Hey, maybe he'll give me
a transfer too, huh, Ben?

859
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:41,122
He'll ask you things like
what do you dream?

860
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,325
Okay.

861
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:45,300
Hey, maybe he'll give me a transfer too,
huh, Ben?

862
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,803
Sure, Will.

863
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:52,368
- The psychiatrist is waiting, Stockdale.
- Coming.

864
00:53:54,848 --> 00:53:55,906
Wait a minute.

865
00:53:56,082 --> 00:53:59,074
The safest thing I guess is
just say that you never dream at all.

866
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:02,881
- Okay. See you later, Ben.
- No dreams.

867
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:12,589
Sergeant?

868
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:14,256
Do you think he can?

869
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:15,492
Can what?

870
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,638
Get transferred too.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor.

871
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:22,036
Now, don't you complicate things.

872
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,016
I never have no dreams at all.

873
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:47,456
- Where are you from, Stockdale?
- Georgia.

874
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,131
That's not much of a state, is it?

875
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:52,794
Well, I don't live all over the state.

876
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:56,272
I just live in this one little place in it.

877
00:54:57,944 --> 00:55:02,847
That's where Tobacco Road is. Georgia.

878
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:06,211
Not around my section.

879
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,650
Maybe you're from a different part
than me.

880
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:10,449
[SIGHS]

881
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:14,658
I've never been there. What's more,
I don't think I would ever wanna go there.

882
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:16,318
What's your reaction to that?

883
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:18,088
Well, I don't know...

884
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:21,825
I would rather live in the rottenest pigsty
in Tennessee or Alabama...

885
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:25,130
...than the fanciest mansion
in all of Georgia.

886
00:55:27,374 --> 00:55:29,103
How about that?

887
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:34,076
Well, sir, I think
where you wanna live is your business.

888
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:42,348
You don't mind if someone says
something bad about Georgia?

889
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:45,252
I ain't heard nobody
say nothing bad about Georgia.

890
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,950
Well, what do you think
I've been saying?

891
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:51,222
Well, to tell you the truth, sir...
