00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:44,610
The mission to capture
Peng is a 2-pronged assault.

182
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:46,345
Cobra Team will take the
Chinese Destroyer Henan

183
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:49,582
at Tokyo Bay, cripple its
CIC, enabling Vulture Team,

184
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:52,752
led by CNO to storm Peng inside
the National Archives.

185
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:55,554
We estimate Henan's ordnance covers
a Weapons Engagement Zone

186
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:57,823
around the Archives of 80-plus miles.

187
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:00,993
However, they'll likely focus
their attention and their fire

188
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,696
on the area surrounding the
Archives building itself.

189
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,264
We'll call this the Hot Zone.

190
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:08,100
Now if Vulture Team is
detected approaching the Archives

191
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,402
from anywhere inside that Hot Zone

192
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,937
and we haven't taken Henan's CIC,

193
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:14,006
that ship fires on Vulture Team.

194
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:16,008
From our monitoring, we
know that Henan checks in

195
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,645
with Peng's ground forces
once every 15 minutes without fail.

196
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,714
Cobra Team will dive and
board Henan when it's D.I.W.

197
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:23,749
at the end of its patrol run in the bay.

198
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,451
Ship will be drifting toward us,

199
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,154
so that'll just shorten
our swim. Master Chief?

200
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,889
Henan is a Luyang III class

201
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:32,024

destroyer similar to our...

202
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,794

203

Ripped off from our Arleigh Burke.

204
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:39,465
Everyone will study the layout.

205
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,567
We need to know every blind
alley on that ship.

Surgical strike on the pilot house, CIC,

207
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:46,071
and armory will give us
complete control over that vessel.

208
00:10:46,073 --> 00:10:48,040
This goes as planned,
the rest of their crew

209
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,942

210
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:54,313
Make no mistake, we're
going after a target

211
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:56,515

212
00:10:56,517 --> 00:11:00,286
and who has a second
destroyer we cannot find.

213
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:03,022
Just one part of this
mission fails, it all fails.

[Speaking Mandarin]

361
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,516
He says if Henan doesn't
respond immediately,

362
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:50,486
he'll assume the ship's
been boarded and fire on us.

363

<i>Man: Henan... [Speaking Mandarin]</i>

364
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,490
He's bluffing.

365
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:58,060
No. We will kill our own to save Peng.

366
00:19:58,062 --> 00:19:59,361
Those are his orders.

367
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:03,432
I assure you, we will be fired on.

What the hell's he saying?

373
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,432
He's preparing the crew to be martyrs.

374
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,400
Oh.

375
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,391
I say again, the second ship
is ordering us to fire on land

376
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:36,959
or they will fire on us.

377
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,229
Bridge, Combat. We
need to go Active Radar.

378
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:41,597
It's the only way to
see the second ship.

379
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,432
Negative. If they're
behind island cover,

380
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:44,934
<i>we'd be giving away our
position for nothing.</i>

381
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:47,236
But if we do, we could target and kill.

382
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:51,573
Commander, it's the only viable option.

- What? No way.
- Dennis, I'm serious.

Today, the idealism of democracy

00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:05,460
is at odds with the
practice of government

523
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:15,070

course for the country.

In the absence of a...
legislative branch,

530
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:50,439
and without an operational
central government,

531
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:53,075
I have decided to
exercise my executive powers...

532
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:55,377
Shame on you, Mr. President!

we know saved St. Louis.

was no panic, no riots.

people dying a day,

00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,026
you kept us together.

540
00:33:11,028 --> 00:33:12,728
What happened to that man, sir?!

541
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,696
The President will not be
taking any questions today.

542
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:16,064
Thank you very much.

543
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:17,766
The hell I won't! Listen,
Jacob, you're right.

544
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:20,402
For a moment, I forgot
who I was, but not anymore!

545
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:21,937
- [Microphone feedback whines]
- I know who I am!

546
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:23,438
Due to the security breach,

547
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,107
I'm sorry, everyone, we
will reconvene tomorrow.

548
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,875
Thank you for your
time. Thank you very much.

549
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:28,343
Miss Shaw, where are they taking him?!

550
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:30,445
Take your goddamn hands off me!

551
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:33,348
[Gunshots, men grunting, casings clatter]

552
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,918
Sir, it's me. It's Kara. I can help you.

553
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,419
This way. You saved my life.

554
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:38,820
Not yet, we haven't.

555
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:40,289
Where are they taking him?!

556
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,324
Is the President a
prisoner in the White House?!

557
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,192
Miss Shaw!

558
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:47,162
- Let's go, right now.
- [Crowd murmuring]

559

- We got a shooter!

561

[Screaming continues]

- [Gunfire]
- Uhh!

563
00:33:56,473 --> 00:33:58,240
Hot damn, son.

564
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,994
- [Static]
- This is Allison Shaw.

565
00:34:18,996 --> 00:34:21,363
We have two shooters escaping
from the East Wing with POTUS.

566
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:26,068
[Gunfire, crowd screaming]

567

[Grunting]

568
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:30,072
We got to go back for Jacob.

569
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:31,907
Let me go! Let me go!

570
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,209
You run back in there,
you don't come back! Jac...

571
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:35,844
It's about the President.

572
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:37,946
- [Gunfire]
- Uhh!

573
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:39,614
[Screaming and gunfire continue]

[Engine revs, tires screech]

576
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:45,487
Go!

577

[Gunshots]

578
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,257
Let go of me!

579
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:50,826
Don't let the vehicle get out!

580

- [Gunfire]
- [Grunts]

581
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:54,796
Lock the gates! Move!

Drive, Kara, drive!

583
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,902

[Tires screeching]

586
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:51,945
Thought I'd be the one to tell you.

587
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:55,348
The Cobra Team found
coordinates of Henan CIC.

588
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,050
You were right.

589
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,486
The Chinese knew where
Hayward and Shackleton were gonna be.

590
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:00,820
Seems someone in St. Louis

591
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:03,957
wants the U.S. Navy out
of the way, Captain.

592
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,993
There's still some
good people back home.

593
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,462
Generals, captains, operators.

594
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:11,097
I know a few myself.

595
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,632
Well, let's get 'em on the line.

596
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:15,135
We need all the help we can muster.

597
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,775
- [Speaking Japanese]
- [Baby whimpers]

598

Captain...

[Speaking Japanese]

601
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:35,088
Kyoko wants to thank
you for all that you've done

602
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,758
for her family and for
Japan. She wishes you well.

603
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,694
Man: You gonna unhook this vest?

604
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:42,462
[Speaks Japanese]

[Baby cries]

[Crew speaking indistinctly]

00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:52,305
She wants to die with her
husband on her own soil.

608
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:55,775
Her people will take care of the baby.

609
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:59,579
I'm fueled up and ready
to go. Jesse, thank you.

610
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:02,382
You saved a lot of lives. You're
gonna save a lot more.

611
00:37:02,384 --> 00:37:05,685
Just get home in one piece.

612
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:07,253
Take care of yourself.

613
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:10,123
Man: I'll have the
final numbers ASAP, sir.

614
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:13,827
Man: No, he's on the hangar deck.

615
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:16,730
Woman: I'll find him. Stand by.

616
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:20,133
Man: Is that the last
of it off the RHIB?

617
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:22,969
- Careful with that.
- Man: Aye, sir. I'm on it.

618
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:27,140
<i>This is NOMAD.</i>

619
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:30,610
<i>All set to deliver the cure to Asia.</i>

620
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:33,346
<i>So long, Mother.</i>

621
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:42,021
Naval Station San Diego.

622
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:46,292
This is CNO hailing
you on Navy Red, over.

623
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:48,561
I say again, Naval Station San Diego.

624
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:51,398
This is CNO hailing
you on Navy Red, over.

625
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,933
Sir, there's something you need to see.

626
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:56,403
<i>Terror grips our nation this day.</i>

627
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:59,072
<i>The strains of
reconstruction have proven too great to bear</i>

628
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:03,243
<i>and have given rise to forces hellbent
on creating chaos. [ Door closes ]</i>

629
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,245
<i>In front of live television cameras,</i>

630
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,680
<i>agitators breached our
walls and tried to take control</i>

631
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:09,382
<i>of this nation's capital.</i>

632
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:12,018
<i>This was not their first attempt.</i>

633
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,720
<i>Until today, the regional leaders and I</i>

634
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:16,222
<i>have guarded the truth for
the safety of the public.</i>

635
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:20,193
<i>Now it's time you, the
American people, learn the facts.</i>

636
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:24,030
<i>President Jeffery Michener
did not take his own life.</i>

637
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:27,400
<i>He was murdered, along
with Senator Beatty</i>

638
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:30,370
<i>and Secretary of Foreign
Affairs, Rivera.</i>

639
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:33,072
<i>The terrorist were working
with certain members of the media</i>

640
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:35,809
<i>and with agents
inside the government itself,</i>

641
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:39,712
<i>but until today, we didn't
know how high it went.</i>

642
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:41,181
<i>It is my duty to inform you</i>

643
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:43,349
<i>that the leader of this radical group</i>

644
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:46,653
<i>was President Howard Oliver himself.</i>

645
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:49,122
<i>He orchestrated the
deaths of Jeffrey Michener</i>

646
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:52,659
<i>and those loyal to him so
that he could take office</i>

647
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,061
<i>and create a dictatorship.</i>

648
00:38:55,063 --> 00:38:57,363
Son of a bitch.

649
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,401

[Gun cocks]

651
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,340
Don't do this. Don't do this.

652
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,677
- Please, don't do this! Don't do...
- [Gunshot]

653
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,245
But that is not all.

654
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:14,714
We have just learned that this
cabal was also responsible

655
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:18,785
for the kidnapping of the
crew of Nathan James in Asia.

656
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,186
This was done with the cooperation

657
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,122
and planning of Captain Tom Chandler.

658
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:25,692
In fact, I struggle
to believe it's true.

659
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:29,162
But we have indisputable
evidence of his treachery.

660
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,130
Captain Chandler is
currently under arrest

661
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:35,068
and is heading back to North America.

662
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,938
[Voice breaking] These are
not easy words for me to say.

663
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,208
Oh, my God. She's
putting all this on you.

664
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,244
- <i>Excuse me. My apologies.</i>
- Nobody'll buy it.

665
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:46,579
The greater the lie, the
more people will believe it.

666
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:49,516
<i>We are strong people, and we
have survived worse than this.</i>

667
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:51,618
<i>And those who still love life, liberty,</i>

668
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,653
<i>and the pursuit of
happiness have come together</i>

669
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:56,389
<i>and formulated a plan to move forward.</i>

670
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:59,859
<i>So in the absence of any working
federal government,</i>

671

<i>and deriving their just powers</i>

00:40:01,663 --> 00:40:03,730
<i>from the consent of the governed,</i>

673
00:40:03,732 --> 00:40:06,733
<i>your regional leaders,
Price, Castillo, Wilson, and Croft</i>

00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:12,305

<i>Each region will be
able to govern itself</i>

677
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:16,009
<i>and focus on reconstruction</i>

678
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:17,877
<i>until such time as a central authority</i>

679
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,412
<i>can be safely reestablished.</i>

680
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,967
Yeah. In other words, never.

681
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,869
<i>By the time you hear these words,</i>

682
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:25,571

Forces will have been split</i>

<i>among the regional leaders,</i>

684
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,375
<i>and I would like to assure you...</i>

685
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:31,543
<i>that the military
turnover has been peaceful,</i>

686
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:34,513
<i>thanks to an unprecedented collaboration</i>

687
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,849
<i>between the nation's highest-ranking
generals</i>

688
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,518
<i>and your four regional leaders. Aah!</i>

689
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,653
<i>All enlisted men and
women are to report to</i>

690
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:44,023
<i>regional military offices
immediately to become part...</i>

691
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,692
<i>Of one of four localized
armies under the command...</i>

692
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,294
Captain, I can't get the
generals on the line...

693
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,030
Any of them.

694
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,733
I tried to raise an entire Naval base.

695
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,435
It's a coup, Captain.

696
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,670
<i>Thank you and God bless.</i>

697
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:01,273
Those men are already dead.

698
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:05,044
If there's no military, what
does that mean for us?

699
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,014
It means we're all alone.

700
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:14,086
We lost our country, Tom.

701
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,491
Not yet.

702
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:24,062
Captain, set a course for
Naval Base San Diego, helpful.

703
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,408
Take us home.
