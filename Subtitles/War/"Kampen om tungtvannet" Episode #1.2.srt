1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,910
The operation goes under
the name of Freshman.

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,310
41 specially trained commandos
sent into the mountains

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,510
in two gliders,

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,750
each pulled by a Halifax bomber. 21
men in one glider, 20 in the other.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,470
Now, the Halifaxes take them
as far as the Norwegian coast,

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,630
then the gliders swoop down,
unnoticed, and land on high ground.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,870
After that, our chaps
slip down to the factory

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,590
- and blow the damn thing to pieces.
- It's quite a big area.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,190
Yes, we'll need people
who can establish depots,

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,270
do reconnaissance,

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,790
men who know the area and of
course speak the language.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,590
A welcoming committee of
Norwegians sent out ahead.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,640
- What do you want me to do?
- Find them. Create an operations unit.

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,190
Captain.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,390
Peggy. Thank you.

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,470
Wilson's office.

17
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,670
Front office.

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,510
- Meeting room.
- Ma'am.

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,070
- George.
- Yes, ma'am?

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,310
Um, my office.

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Radio room, tea room, your office.

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,830
The Germans have apparently searched
both your office and your home.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,630
It appears you didn't
leave a moment too soon.

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,390
Your wife and children are safe,
they're with the in-laws.

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,070
Maybe it would be a better solution
if my family came here.

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,630
- That's not an option.
- They won't be any trouble.

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,950
Do you see any children
here, Mr Tronstad?

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,630
They've been evacuated
so they don't get bombed.

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,190
Norway may have been invaded

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,030
but it's still a far safer
place than England.

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,080
You obviously don't have children.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,480
So how long have you known about
the Germans' atomic programme?

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,350
Well, that depends on what
you mean by "known".

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,230
Since Poland there's been no
information on anything that

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,350
smells of Wissenschaft
which is strange

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
but I suppose that no information at
least leaves room for speculation.

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,970
DISTANT GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSION

38
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,110
So, these are all
Norwegian volunteers?

39
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,630
They keep coming. Hundreds of them.

40
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,670
They sign in there and we
put them straight to work.

41
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,150
- Who's that?
- Hm?

42
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
The redhead.

43
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,230
Skinnarland. Eenar.

44
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,590
Einar.

45
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,910
Einar.

46
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,430
He came in this morning. Hijacked
a boat with some other lads.

47
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,480
- I've seen him at the factory.
- You have indeed.

48
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,550
You must go!

49
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,750
- No!
- No! Jump!

50
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,230
AIRCRAFT BLADES WHIR

51
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,280
WIND WHISTLES

52
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,640
BELLS TOLL

53
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,620
A-hem!

54
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,390
Danish for, "Nice to see you"?

55
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,470
THEY CHUCKLE

56
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,670
It's so good to be here.

57
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,230
- I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the conference.
- No-one did.

58
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,190
There wasn't a single scientist
worth mentioning in the room.

59
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,670
- I was expecting at least...
- Not because of you.

60
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,630
Everybody wanted to see you.

61
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,680
You know, let's go for a walk.

62
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,350
You are being bugged?

63
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Oh, yeah. We discovered it a couple
of months ago. But it's all right.

64
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,840
- All right? It's awful.
- Well, you just have to
think before you talk.

65
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,430
Which, actually, isn't
such a bad idea.

66
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,590
- The Institute, as well?
- Yes, everywhere. But it's...

67
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I mean, out here, it's OK.

68
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,150
What?

69
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,070
I don't know...

70
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,710
.. I don't know how much you know.

71
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,550
Times are changing, your regime.

72
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Yes, I've noticed.

73
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,470
Don't you miss the old days working
at the Institute together?

74
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,030
Oh, yes, I certainly do.

75
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Copenhagen is not so far from Berlin.

76
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
The thing is, I'm... I'm
not allowed to say anything.

77
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I was even asked to find out about
your position with the Brits!

78
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,550
I don't care about those things.

79
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,790
Politicians come and
go, majorities change,

80
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,110
but science only moves forward.

81
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
One discovery leads to the next.

82
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,830
I'm not trying to sway
you in any one way.

83
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
But the project I'm working on
is just, everybody's winning.

84
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,950
With money. Resources.

85
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's not just a little department or
an institute, it's bigger than that.

86
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,030
I want this to happen.

87
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,830
Finally, it's under my control.

88
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
As long as we let the war serve
the science, there is no danger.

89
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Imagine everything we can do.

90
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,870
- Pull out of it.
- Huh!

91
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,590
What?

92
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Pull out of the whole damn thing.

93
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,990
- Is it the Brits?
- What?

94
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,910
Have you been briefed by the Brits?

95
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,350
No, no, no, no, no.

96
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,150
They have absolutely nothing
to do with this whatsoever.

97
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm the one who's telling you.

98
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,350
You work for them.

99
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,270
I thought I came to see a friend.

100
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Well, I'm still your friend.

101
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,470
- You don't understand what I'm talking about.
- I don't understand?

102
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,520
No.

103
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Now, do you get it?

104
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,910
Yes.

105
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I get it.

106
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
You've always asked me which
moral obligations we have.

107
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Well, here's my answer.

108
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,550
Our obligations have
never been bigger.

109
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
- Yes, but as scientists...
- Cut the crap.

110
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,270
- Crap?
- Yes, crap. You know exactly
what I'm talking about!

111
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,790
You're working for the German army.

112
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,870
Come on, which planet are you
on?! They've hired you. Why?

113
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,710
To front German culture?

114
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,750
To see you make some interesting
calculations on a blackboard?

115
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,790
No, they've hired you because
they want something in return.

116
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,550
They want value for
their money. Results.

117
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,670
And ideally, something that explodes.

118
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,270
Listen.

119
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,470
We are working with creating energy.

120
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Our moral obligations have never
been bigger than they are now.

121
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,760
And if you don't understand that...

122
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,230
.. then you are either
stupid, or very naive.

123
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,630
And right now, both of them
are equally dangerous.

124
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,230
Let me give you one
last piece of advice.

125
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,750
As your friend.

126
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,990
Don't ever tell anyone
that you asked me

127
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,040
to be a part of your programme.

128
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,430
Now, would you care
to join me for dinner?

129
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,750
My wife would be happy to see you

130
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,390
and she's longing to hear
you playing the piano.

131
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
I will sit there and I will eat
and, of course, I'll applaud.

132
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,280
THEY SING

133
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,440
THEY SING

134
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,750
They leave in three weeks,
first full moon.

135
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,070
They're not ready.

136
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,120
They're ready.

137
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Being enthusiastic is not
the same as being ready.

138
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Wanting to do something is not the
same as being able to do something.

139
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,520
And being hungover is
not being fit to fight.

140
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,990
Takes a lot to convince her.

141
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,430
I pity the husband.

142
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,630
Her husband went down with HMS
Prince of Wales last December.

143
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,350
Sunk with the Japanese.

144
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,790
He's still missing.

145
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,590
She works a lot.

146
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,110
A-hem!

147
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,910
They'll be all right.

148
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,030
- Absolutely.
- Sooner or later.

149
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,300
One hopes sooner.

150
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,670

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,150

- So... what do we do now?
- I can step in!

161
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,860
Yes, and who's going to do your
job? The bloody footless one?

162
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,910
These men can be replaced.
You can't, Tronstad.

163
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,820
OK, they can go without him.

164
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,870
All right. It's your decision.

In case of German capture, bite hard.

229
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,400
