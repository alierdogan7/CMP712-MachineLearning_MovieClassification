1
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,754
- Well?
- It's the big cannon again, sir.

2
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,235
- Get rid of it.
- Leave it for the French?

3
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,794
- Get rid of it!
- Yes, sir.

4
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,595
Yes, sir?

5
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,632
Ah, Major, you have accomplished
the impossible.

6
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,072
How can a seven-ton 42ft cannon slip
through your fingers and leave no rust?

7
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,510
They must have destroyed it, sir.
It was too large, in my opinion...

8
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,029
In my opinion,
you don't know peas from powder.

9
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,153
General Jouvet wants that cannon.
Your orders are recover it, not evaluate it.

10
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,396
- Yes, sir.
- And Vidal?

11
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,513
The English want that cannon too. Enough
to send an agent to Spain to get it.

12
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,232
Do not fail.

13
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,433
The general is the kind of man who will
find work for both of us in the stables.

14
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,913
Yes, sir.

15
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,472
Out.

16
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,476
- English?
- English.

17
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,273
Take me to army headquarters.

18
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,432
English.

19
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,156
I'm looking for General Larena's staff.

20
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,470
- They've moved?
- Retreated.

21
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,591
Where?

22
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,315
- Who are you?
- We are the Spanish who do not retreat.

23
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,351
<i>Guerrilleros.</i>

24
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,358
If your business has to do with
this province, you talk with me.

25
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,869
My orders are for General Larena.

26
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,796
Sorry.

27
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,709
Juana!

28
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,670
Read these orders.

29
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,635
He is called Anthony Trumbell,
a naval captain.

30
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,276
General Larena is to turn over to him
a huge cannon

31
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,153
and the men to haul it to Santander.

32
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,997
What for?

33
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,111
To keep it out of Napoleon's hands.

34
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,119
- The English are fighting him too.
- Why did they send a sailor?

35
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,030
Because I speak Spanish
and have studied ordnance.

36
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,268
Guns.

37
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,154
You would like to see this gun?

38
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,879
I would like to see it, yes.

39
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,436
Thank you.

40
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,515
- Do the English have such a cannon?
- No one in the world has such a cannon.

41
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,234
- Is it bad?
- It can be repaired.

42
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,318
- Can you do it?
- If I had the men.

43
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,032
I have the men.

44
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,116
Blacksmiths? Carpenters?

45
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,073
Guillermo! Francisco! Pepe!

46
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,077
Listen to the captain.

47
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,035
I'll need six heavy wooden beams.
And take the gears from the guns they left.

48
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,118
Carlos! Get them.
And get everybody up on the road.

49
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,153
Oh, and rope.
I'll need all the rope you can get.

50
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,317
- Anything else?
- That's all for now.

51
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,756
Yes, Captain.

52
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,235
Get those mules moving!

53
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,030
Let it swing clear!

54
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,160
No, no. More to the left.

55
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,357
Miguel! Miguel!

56
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,550
- French cavalry!
- How far?

57
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,558
- Across the valley.
- They will be here in an hour.

58
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,639
Leave the gun where it is.
It's easier to hide all this up here.

59
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,354
Get José off the gun. Quickly!

60
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,393
Ramón! Take some men from the ropes
and cut the trees. Help them. Help them.

61
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,795
Carlos! Bring up the men.

62
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,876
Secure the ropes.

63
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,713
Hook up those mules.
Tie those tightly. We are moving.

64
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,389
I think this is the best route to Santander.

65
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,996
Yes, Captain.

66
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,112
But this gun is going to Ávila.

67
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,196
- I beg your pardon?
- Ávila.

68
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,959
- But you said...
- I said nothing.

69
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,029
You know my orders.
General Larena agreed to give us the gun.

70
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,797
But General Larena is not here.

71
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,471
You can't fight your way
across half of Spain with 200 men.

72
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,831
- With this gun, I will get the men I need.
- You have no powder.

73
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,997
- I will get it.
- The whole world is fighting Napoleon.

74
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,634
Compared to that, Ávila's a flyspeck.

75
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,629
I do not know about the rest of the world.
Ávila is French headquarters in Spain.

76
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,514
But it's 1,000km from here.
The country is swarming with French.

77
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,677
- You'll never get there.
- We will get there.

78
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,157
Ávila has a wall, Captain,
and this gun was made to fight walls.

79
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,475
We will get there no matter what it costs.

80
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,798
If it costs the lives of every one of us,
we are going to take Ávila.

81
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,675
And the French will then know
that their day in Spain is over.

82
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,830
You must be mad. All of you.

83
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,440
Captain, you want the gun in Santander,
and I want it in Ávila.

84
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,519
Go with us.
Show us how to use it, how to move it.

85
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,270
And afterwards we will help you
get the gun to Santander.

86
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,315
How do I know you'll keep your promise?

87
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,396
You do not.

88
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,310
- Get the captain's horse!
- I prefer to walk with the gun.

89
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,874
You might get tired, Captain.

90
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,950
Bring the horse!

91
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,071
<i>(mule brays)</i>

92
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,156
Captain, your face is dirty.

93
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,115
<i>(sings)</i>

94
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,158
Ah, Juanita! <i>Olé!</i>

95
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,551
<i>(crowd) Olé!</i>

96
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,238
<i>Olé!</i>

97
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,912
Juanita! Juanita!

98
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,873
<i>Olé! Olé!</i>

99
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,116
It is late.

100
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,752
What are you doing?

101
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,192
Taking the Englishman some food.
He did not eat with the others.

102
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,519
Then he does not eat. I ate. You ate.
He is no different than we are.

103
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,473
- But he is different.
- Mm. How?

104
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,230
He knows about guns.
You need him. You said so yourself.

105
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,629
I said nothing. I do not like him.

106
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,433
Miguel, you're jealous.

107
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,472
- Not of him.
- Anybody who looks at me.

108
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,991
And this one more, because
he can fire the cannon and you can't.

109
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,749
- How do you know? Maybe I can.
- You know you can't.

110
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,079
You say things you don't mean and then
you are sorry. We need him. Admit it.

111
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,274
I do not like the way he looks at you.

112
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,719
Miguel.

113
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,276
And I do not like the way you look at him.

114
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,073
That is still my privilege.

115
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,952
You know this Miguel
and you know him well.

116
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,072
You know he has the gun and where it is.

117
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,953
I am waiting for you to tell me.

118
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,196
Make no mistake, I speak to you as your
enemy, and I shall be your executioner.

119
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,717
Very well. An example must be set.

120
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,638
I shall begin by hanging all ten of you.

121
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,515
For every day after,
I shall hang ten more. And ten more.

122
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,235
If necessary,
every woman and child in Ávila,

123
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,388
until we loose some tongues
and I am told where this cannon is.

124
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,356
Take them out.

125
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,232
<i>(spits)</i>

126
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,755
Carry out the order.

127
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,233
I'm doubtful, sir.
I'm doubtful that these hangings...

128
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,271
I know, I know.

129
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,198
You wouldn't think it was worth it to them.

130
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,675
How big can a cannon be?

131
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,758
At half the size
it would excite their imagination.

132
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,270
The people of an occupied country
begin as martyrs.

133
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,793
Give them something to rally around and
die for, and they explode into a new army.

134
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,071
That is the real danger
of this cannon, General.

135
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,352
I am not stupid, Sermaine.
I know we have to find it.

136
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,835
<i>(drum roll followed by thud)</i>

137
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>(drum roll followed by thud)</i>

138
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,960
<i>(drum roll followed by thud)</i>

139
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,468
We ought to be able to build and assemble
this raft in about three days.

140
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,195
There'll be 100 logs underneath.
We'll lash the cannon to this platform.

141
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,394
- I think we can get it across the river.
- I think it will sink.

142
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,389
It won't. But in any event it's the only way.
Unless you expect the river to dry up.

143
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,832
I expect to get this cannon to Ávila.
This way, we might lose it.

144
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,511
Not if I get cooperation.
I repeat, we'll need 100 logs.

145
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,672
All right. You get the men,
start cutting the trees.

146
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,477
You got your way, Captain.
But if this cannon sinks...

147
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,717
- It won't. And I'm sick of your threats.
- I do not like this.

148
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,958
- You don't have to. It will succeed.
- All I have is your word. It is not enough.

149
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,230
- Then don't do it! Recall the men!
- All right!

150
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,878
Wait. I know... and both of you know
the reason for this stupid argument.

151
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,551
If you are going to cross the river,
we are wasting time.

152
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,034
<i>(slow rhythmic hammering)</i>

153
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,235
Let it out easily!

154
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,514
Pull, pull! Keep pulling!

155
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,075
Get to the other rope!

156
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,872
Look at it. Mud up to its barrel.

157
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,912
I wish I'd never seen the thing.

158
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,998
- Can we pull it out?
- How? With what?

159
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,395
- We have the men and the mules.
- They won't budge it an inch.

160
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,759
- How many people would it take?
- 1,000. 2,000.

161
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,189
There are more than that
in Algado, Miguel.

162
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,236
<i>(whistling and rhythmic clapping)</i>

163
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,350
Citizens of Algado...

164
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,311
I spit in your faces.

165
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,318
I am Miguel of the gun, and of Ávila.

166
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,430
In Ávila, we do not sit in the bullring
with the French.

167
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,315
And we do not fly the flag of Spain
beside the flag of the enemy.

168
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,236
<i>(man shouts)</i>

169
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,390
<i>Arrêtez! Arrêtez!</i>

170
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,717
What kind of people are you,
sitting here enjoying your life?

171
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,750
200 miles from here,

172
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,318
the enemy amuses himself,
holding Spanish babies on bayonets.

173
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,233
Do you feel nothing in your hearts?
Can you feel no shame?

174
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,748
Across the river,
a cannon is buried in the mud.

175
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,235
We need your help.

176
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,035
I do not ask you to die.

177
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,038
Or even to bleed.

178
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,515
Just to sweat a little.

179
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,072
So you can tell your children
that Algado sweat for the Resistance.

180
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,875
And those of you...
who are still Spanish... can follow me.

181
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,990
Your face is dirty.

182
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,955
You can't risk it.

183
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,072
We have to.

184
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,909
They outnumber you,
and there's a gun for every man.

185
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,592
- It'll take three weeks to go around them.
- All right, three weeks.

186
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,392
Captain, in Ávila there is
a general in Napoleon's army.

187
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,239
General Henri Jouvet.

188
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,669
His uniforms are beautiful.

189
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,351
His wine comes from France,
and his women from Morocco.

190
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,269
And every morning, to stop the
Resistance, and for his own pleasure,

191
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,755
he hangs ten Spaniards.

192
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,357
In three weeks,
he will hang 210 Spaniards.

193
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,756
You're risking the gun and everything
because of those hangings.

194
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,431
Has it occurred to you how many more
he'll hang if you never get to Ávila?

195
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,836
There are thousands expecting the gun.
I cannot wait.

196
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,315
I want no part of it.

197
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,196
If we fail, Captain, then you can
pull the gun to Santander by yourself.

198
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,635
The Duke of Wellington.

199
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,432
Captain, there are some things
you cannot change.

200
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,558
- And Miguel is one of them.
- That's unfortunate for all of us.

201
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,117
- You are taking no part in this, are you?
- I have no desire to commit suicide.

202
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,550
Listen to me. I know Miguel is difficult.
He's stubborn...

203
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,148
That's an understatement,
if I've ever heard one.

204
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,510
Nobody knows him better than I.

205
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,110
But you, you act as if you were
on the deck of a ship.

206
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,997
Miguel has never seen one. He is fighting
the only way he knows, as a <i>guerrillero.</i>

207
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,998
- You think he's right, don't you?
- All of us do.

208
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,556
But even if he's wrong,
we will go with him.

209
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,075
I hope you will too.

210
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,952
Why?

211
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,157
Captain, I have an idea
you'd like to act more like a man

212
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,238
than a cold piece of English mutton.

213
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,796
We are ready.
You stay here with Maria and him.

214
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,388
I'll need five men.

215
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,353
- For what?
- To get their powder.

216
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,875
Get him the men.

217
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,113
<i>Guerrilleros! Guerrilleros!</i>

218
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,356
Get these powder kegs away from here.
Come on! Come on! Quickly! Quickly!

219
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,596
Quickly.

220
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,915
Out! Out!

221
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,635
It's going! Jump! Jump!

222
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,955
<i>Je ne fais pas partie de I'état-major.</i>
<i>Je n'ai aucune information.</i>

223
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,755
He's a field officer, not a staff man.
He doesn't know.

224
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,190
Tell him to search his memory, quickly.

225
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,311
<i>Essayez de vous souvenir, vite.</i>

226
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,000
<i>Je n'ai rien à dire. Je suis prêt.</i>

227
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,992
<i>(gunshot)</i>

228
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,110
<i>Dites-leur ce qu'ils veulent savoir.</i>
<i>Vous pouvez sauver votre vie.</i>

229
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,789
- What did you say?
- I'm trying to stop you murdering him.

230
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,549
I told him to talk. <i>Allez, parlez.</i>

231
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,752
<i>Je vous jure qu'il n'y a</i>
<i>aucune formation entre ici et Ávila.</i>

232
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,395
<i>J'ai une famille, et je ne veux pas mourir.</i>

233
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,470
He swears there's nothing between
here and Ávila. He doesn't want to die.

234
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,030
They were lying.

235
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,715
I'm surprised you bother to wash your
hands. That kind of blood won't come off.

236
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,230
- So?
- I refuse to watch cold-blooded murder.

237
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,716
Then do not watch. Stay out of the way.
You interfere too much.

238
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,400
- If not for that cannon, I...
- You would do what?

239
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,149
- I'd leave and let you fire it yourself.
- Then leave. We do not need you.

240
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,635
- You know I have my orders.
- This is my order.

241
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,957
Leave, Captain, or the next
cold-blooded murder will be yours.

242
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,308
You're insane.

243
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,719
There's a British ship in the harbour
at Las Cruces. Get on it. Go!

244
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,308
All right, I'll go tonight.

245
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,396
Go <i>now,</i> Captain.

246
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,238
I hope you're satisfied.

247
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,876
The British won't get the gun, he can't
fire it, so that's the end of your Ávila.

248
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,560
- He's still going there.
- Then he's a fool.

249
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,673
And I am going with him.
You can't understand that, can you?

250
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,360
It's none of my affair now.

251
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,589
You won't understand this either, Captain.

252
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,919
My father and brother were sentenced
by General Jouvet to be hung.

253
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,395
The general admired me.

254
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,431
I went to him.

255
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,117
He hung them anyway.

256
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,792
In the hills with the others,
I had one prayer - to die.

257
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,629
I had no hope, no purpose.

258
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,958
Until a man who was
the son of the shoemaker came.

259
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,757
He gave us a reason to live, to fight.
That was Miguel.

260
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,189
Well, then, I'd say
you've been grateful long enough.

261
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,357
- I am staying with him.
- You mean you're living with him.

262
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,315
But you don't love him.
That's the part of you that's cheap.

263
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,430
The British captain and the <i>guerrillero's</i>
woman - not a very good match.

264
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,716
I'll take my chances.

265
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,274
Enough to fire the cannon?

266
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,868
He said he'd do that himself.

267
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,514
Miguel doesn't always
mean what he says.

268
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,949
I won't apologise to him.

269
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,071
You won't have to.

270
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,033
I have already done that for you.

271
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,509
How much French cardboard
can a man eat?

272
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,279
Three days, this and water.

273
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,358
To pull this gun, a man needs food.

274
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,153
- You are not a man yet.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

275
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,119
He follows you anywhere,
and you make fun of him.

276
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,670
José, they are only teasing you.

277
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,110
I can do as much as any of them.
You know it.

278
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,514
More.

279
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,794
You are young and brave
and strong and handsome.

280
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,789
All any woman could desire.
And, besides, you're intelligent. And...

281
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,512
All right, Juana.

282
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,200
That's enough. I give up.

283
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,072
<i>(shouting)</i>

284
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,595
<i>Excelencia. Excelencia,</i> please!
<i>Excelencia! Excelencia,</i> please!

285
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,032
There are children in the village.
Give us back our food. We will starve.

286
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,197
At least the bread. Leave us something.

287
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,278
Miguel. And cognac!

288
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,714
- What is the matter?
- I doubt if you'd listen.

289
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,796
What is it?

290
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,832
- We need the food, don't we?
- We need the peasants more.

291
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,714
- What do you know about peasants?
- Obviously I know very little.

292
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,515
But I know you expect thousands
of them to meet you at Ávila.

293
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,110
Let me worry about the peasants.
I'm tired of you and your ideas.

294
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,708
Every village we come to
will hide their food.

295
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,513
And when we need help
with the gun, they'll disappear.

296
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,191
All right. You are in command. I give you
permission. You handle the peasants.

297
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,279
Go get the money and pay them.
In pounds sterling.

298
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,191
He's wrong. You'd better tell him so.

299
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,070
I know peasants. I live with peasants. I do
not need anybody to tell me about them.

300
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,430
- Of course not.
- You think he is right?

301
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,758
- I think perhaps...
- You think too much for a woman.

302
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,914
I think you are right, Miguel.

303
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,592
Miguel. Tell him you are sorry
for what you said.

304
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,394
José.

305
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,470
Wipe your nose.

306
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,630
An entire encampment wiped out.

307
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:05,836
Pretty picture - the invincible French
army running with our nightgowns on fire.

308
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,110
And still they elude us.

309
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,189
We are strangers in their house, General.
They know where to fight, when to hide.

310
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,311
They're hiding now someplace.

311
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,273
They will move again,
and I think I know where.

312
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,152
- They have help.
- Ah, peasants.

313
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,477
Not only peasants.
There's a British naval officer with them.

314
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,549
And a British man-of-war
in the harbour of Las Cruces. Here.

315
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,432
Very well.

316
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,719
Very well.

317
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:39,915
I want every road and trail into Las Cruces
blocked, day and night patrols.

318
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,395
We will see if you are right.

319
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,509
Carlos! Carlos!

320
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,032
The wagons!

321
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,116
Where are the wagons?

322
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,270
- Well, where are the wagons?
- Well, I don't know.

323
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,233
I don't know what happened to them.

324
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,711
They're in the village. I sent them back.

325
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,673
You sent them back?

326
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,510
Miguel.

327
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,509
- Carlos will kill him.
- I will only let him kill him a little.

328
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,315
Carlos, enough.

329
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,717
It isn't too bad. In a few days...

330
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,799
In a few days I can remember
I killed that man with a knife.

331
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,799
- Miguel didn't mean it to go that far.
- Of course not.

332
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,832
It was simply an entertainment.

333
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,359
I'm sorry. Really.

334
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,678
Don't be. Don't imagine this has anything
to do with those wagons.

335
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,189
He's jealous, and he has reason to be.

336
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,675
I told you I would go to Ávila
to fire the gun,

337
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,473
and, no matter what he does, I'm going.

338
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,910
But not for him. And not for orders.

339
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,191
He knows the reason, and so do you.

340
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,476
We saw infantry, Miguel,
on the other side of the river.

341
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,956
This is open country.
We mustn't be caught here.

342
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,958
We won't be.
The Cano is too much to cross.

343
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,268
- There is a bridge.
- There is no bridge. I know the Cano.

344
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,233
The French have made one, on boats.

345
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,193
- How many boats are there?
- 15, 16.

346
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,671
I'll need at least 500lbs of powder.

347
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,756
You'll need...?

348
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,797
All right. Unload the powder wagons.

349
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,230
Anthony.

350
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,512
Take José. He worked in the mines.
He knows powder.

351
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,113
Take him. I will tell Miguel.

352
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,830
How old are you?

353
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,480
They think I am 20.

354
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,556
I'm really 18.

355
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,550
Are you afraid?

356
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,436
No.

357
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,516
I am.

358
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,396
Do you know why
Juana sent me with you?

359
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,636
- To help.
- Sure.

360
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,354
Also, she likes you.

361
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,950
I was lying.

362
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,514
I am afraid.

363
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,313
But don't worry. I can do it.

364
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,198
I think it's time to get our feet wet.

365
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,872
<i>(splash)</i>

366
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,196
<i>(horse whinnies)</i>

367
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,189
<i>Arrêtez!</i>

368
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,918
I was looking for you.
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry about José.

369
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,468
You couldn't help it.

370
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,832
Juana.

371
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,435
For all my life I've been afraid.
Nothing ever lasts.

372
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,997
I'm afraid that tonight is just a dream
and it won't last.

373
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,429
It will. I promise you.

374
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,109
Some other time, some other place,
you might not even look at me.

375
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,199
All right. Do you want
to hear me say it? I...

376
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,878
No.

377
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,356
I mean it might be different in England.

378
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:46,357
In England I'd keep you locked up in an
ivory tower, guarded by trusted servants,

379
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,869
and I'd have the only key. A gold one.

380
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,389
You can't afford that on a captain's pay.

381
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,433
I'll be an admiral by then.
We'll have our own carriage.

382
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,997
And when the king commands,
we'll go to the grand ball.

383
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,674
I will need a very special dress.

384
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,554
Yes. And a blue cape
to match my uniform.

385
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,838
I'll have to be careful when I bow.
The trousers are very tight. They can split.

386
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,916
It happened once.

387
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,515
Anthony?

388
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,278
Yes?

389
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,551
- Who were you with?
- When?

390
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,035
When your trousers split.

391
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,118
As I was saying,
the king will want to meet you, of course.

392
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:44,315
And you can tell him how once, long ago
in Spain, you met an English captain

393
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,591
and made him
the proudest man in the world.

394
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,316
I love you, Anthony.

395
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,153
Juana.

396
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,269
Yes?

397
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,476
All of us here are Spanish,

398
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,798
and we know what we want and what
we will have to pay to go to Ávila.

399
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,155
I understand that, Miguel.

400
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,117
But you want more.
You are thinking of after Ávila.

401
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,919
Yes.

402
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,955
That part, I do not know.

403
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,636
But we have been together
a long time, Juana.

404
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,312
You have lived with me, and I cannot
even read or write my own name.

405
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,555
And when I cannot say the words
I want to say, you have said them for me,

406
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,353
and I have felt equal to any man.

407
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:29,428
But, inside... inside myself,
I know I am less.

408
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,756
Did you think I cannot feel in my heart
that a woman wants more?

409
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:45,673
I can only repay you with
what we started out for - Ávila.

410
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,871
If this is not enough, tell me, then.

411
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,712
The attempt of this staff
to locate a handful of rabble

412
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,879
will go down in military history
as a monument to ineptitude.

413
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,949
Your ambitions and careers dissolve
in these cannon tracks across Spain.

414
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,753
It has now cost us a bridge
and a full company of men

415
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,873
to find out exactly where
that cannon is. Here.

416
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,876
Huh?

417
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,959
A long way from
Las Cruces and the sea, Colonel.

418
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,832
Yes, sir.

419
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,317
They're in these mountains.
There is a pass. Here.

420
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,319
They will come through it.
I intend them to.

421
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,876
I don't think they will come out this time.

422
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,795
Well?

423
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,037
There are French cannon up there.
Everybody knows that.

424
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,391
- And I know it too.
- How can you think of going through?

425
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,513
- Do you know another way?
- We said we'd help, not kill ourselves.

426
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,074
They'll catch you in a crossfire.

427
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,078
They may not hear us.
We'll muffle the wheels and hooves.

428
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,760
You guarantee
every Frenchman is stone deaf?

429
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,190
If we get halfway through
before they hear us we'll have a chance.

430
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,471
Do you think being a mule
is all that's expected of you?

431
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,114
We left our shops and our farms.

432
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,549
If they opened your veins, do you know
what would come out? Not blood.

433
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,433
You see, we have to go south
to get to Ávila.

434
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,677
To go south, we have to go through here.
You do understand?

435
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,314
Yes, Captain, we understand it perfectly.

436
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,556
We may be a little ashamed of it,

437
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,435
but we all have wives and children,
and we are not ready to die for this gun.

438
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,792
- But we must have your help.
- Ah, we go without them!

439
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,308
His astonishing charm
has won the day again.

440
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,512
- Do you want me to get on my knees?
- If it would do any good, yes!

441
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,712
- But we need them, Miguel.
- Not that much.

442
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,673
50 Greeks once held a pass like this
against 1,000 men.

443
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,678
- We're about to try it the other way round.
- Captain.

444
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,075
I do not know history.

445
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,112
But I do know this -

446
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:17,394
that I will stand before
the statue of Santa Teresa in Ávila.

447
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,758
<i>(slams)</i>

448
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,076
<i>(donkey brays)</i>

449
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,036
<i>(distant cannon fire)</i>

450
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,510
Cease fire!

451
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,110
They are out of range,
but every road is blocked.

452
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,438
Ready!

453
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,518
They are not at either end,
and the pass is empty.

454
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,076
Hold your position until further orders.

455
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,635
Log! Log!

456
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,237
Pull! Pull!

457
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,429
You said you knew these hills.
We can't go down there.

458
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,597
- We came up, we can go down.
- It'll pick up too much momentum.

459
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:08,315
There's a ratio between
velocity and mass.

460
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,389
If it weighs five tons coming up slowly,
going down fast it can weigh 10-15.

461
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,556
We wouldn't be able to hold it.

462
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,070
Up or down, it weighs what it weighs.

463
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,350
Turn the mules.

464
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,115
Keep turning! Move, quick!

465
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,159
Bring up the log! The log!

466
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,196
Captain.

467
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,714
Log! Log!

468
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,196
Get out! Get out!

469
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,035
Cut the mules loose!

470
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,592
Jump!

471
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,796
<i>(bleats)</i>

472
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,353
The barrel's broken off the pivot.

473
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,073
We cannot go up, we must go down.

474
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,236
Brilliant.

475
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,112
Um...

476
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,033
It was heavier coming down.

477
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,236
There's a village near here
called Maneciras.

478
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,510
Man-e-ciras.

479
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,472
Man-e-ciras.

480
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,957
I suggest we go into Maneciras
and find a place to repair the gun.

481
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,631
We need tools, a forge,
a place where the French can't find us.

482
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:01,470
Miguel, if there are any French there,
he cannot wear that uniform.

483
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,158
No.

484
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,636
Who do you suggest this time?

485
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,910
Take your pick.

486
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,715
You, unfortunately.

487
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,795
Spanish fleas, Captain.
They wouldn't dare bite an Englishman.

488
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,276
<i>(bugles)</i>

489
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:31,837
- <i>(man)</i> You have our permission for that.
- <i>(Miguel)</i> There is something else.

490
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,757
- Yes?
- The gun.

491
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:38,158
My son, the power of
the Holy Office is great,

492
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,317
but we cannot turn a cannon
into a penitent for you.

493
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:46,309
If we could hide it, Your Grace, and bring
it into the cathedral and take it apart...

494
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,557
- Inside of the cathedral?
- Just for a night.

495
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:54,231
This is Holy Week.
You can't defile a sanctuary.

496
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,920
Soldiers and guns belong out there.

497
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:01,352
This is the house of God, not an arsenal.

498
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,030
You ask too much.

499
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,316
Your Grace!

500
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,874
You cannot refuse them.

501
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,319
"Cannot"?

502
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,991
It's useless wrapping yourself in authority
and quoting rules to these people.

503
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,999
It's not enough to say that a gun
doesn't belong inside their cathedral.

504
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:39,399
This isn't merely a gun. It's the only
symbol of resistance left in Spain.

505
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:44,071
Do you know how many of them have
given their lives just to drag it this far?

506
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:49,797
You should have looked back and seen a
mountain pass covered with dead as I did.

507
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,876
For what?

508
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,359
If you don't know the reason, you're
Spanish, you're a man of the church,

509
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,152
you can feel it.

510
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,830
You mustn't refuse them.

511
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,835
Very well.

512
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,191
The Holy Week procession starts tonight.

513
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,675
Bring your cannon in then.

514
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:44,880
Holy Mother, thank you
for answering my prayer.

515
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,269
He understands now.

516
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,193
And I love him even more.

517
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:57,112
I know I've sinned in your eyes.

518
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:02,678
Only, for the first time since
I was a little girl, I dared to dream.

519
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,830
But there is Miguel.

520
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,918
There is <i>his</i> dream - Ávila.

521
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,193
And I am a part of that forever.

522
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:21,268
It's too much to ask
that you grant my wishes for both.

523
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,595
Only listen,

524
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:29,158
and find it in your heart
to forgive me when I choose.

525
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:43,316
This is for Miguel and Ávila.

526
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:52,991
And this is for the love
I have found with another.

527
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,956
Inside the cathedral?

528
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,514
Yes. The cannon is there, sir.

529
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:20,598
- You're either mad or drunk.
- Both.

530
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,915
I swear I saw it.

531
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,880
All right. We'll have a look.

532
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,759
So... our visitor has finally arrived.

533
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,840
It is larger than I thought.

534
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,916
Indeed it is.

535
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,713
Do you think it can breach the wall?

536
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,034
Yes.

537
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:20,075
If it doesn't blow up in their faces.
How many would you say are out there?

538
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,510
Around 10,000. And more coming.

539
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,358
Too big a risk for cavalry.

540
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,595
<i>(sighs)</i>

541
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,757
Everything's a little too big today.

542
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,793
How these Spaniards love
their moment of truth,

543
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:42,268
this compulsion to die,
to drench the ground with their blood.

544
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,913
Why?

545
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,874
Probably because
it is their ground, General.

546
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,510
All right.

547
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,712
Do you want me to tell you
how it will be done?

548
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,313
Do you want a miracle?

549
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,398
There are no miracles. Only the gun.

550
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,273
You tell them the truth, eh?

551
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:27,868
In the morning, the gun will be fired
at the wall from a range of 1600yds.

552
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,116
The cannonballs weigh 96lbs each.

553
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:35,633
At impact they will be travelling
fast enough to weigh 9,000lbs.

554
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,911
I think they can make a breach in the wall.

555
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,673
What about the French guns?

556
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:48,795
You will all be out of range
until you get within 1,000yds.

557
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:51,559
Then it will begin.

558
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,318
I've counted 80 cannon on the walls.

559
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:00,837
When you get within 1,000yds,
they will fire grenades.

560
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,876
These will explode in the air and the
cannonballs inside of them will reach you.

561
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,835
At 500yds, it will be grapeshot -
pieces of metal and chain.

562
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:16,594
And when you're closer,
massed infantry fire.

563
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:23,510
By the time you've reached the wall,
your losses will be at least 50 per cent.

564
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,600
Do you understand?

565
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,110
We understand, Miguel.

566
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,633
These people have died before.

567
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:34,876
Good night.

568
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,196
Good night.

569
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,589
What I told them, what it will be, is true.

570
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,791
Yes.

571
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,395
Juana, I want you
to stay with me at the cannon.

572
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,959
- But all the others will not be able to.
- I know.

573
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,958
But if you love me, you'll promise.

574
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,790
I love you, Anthony.

575
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,035
Then promise.

576
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,910
I promise.

577
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,436
I think you should tell Miguel.

578
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,075
I will not have to.

579
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,318
He will know.

580
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:17,956
It's... it's so quiet now.

581
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,638
Yes.

582
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:30,279
All those people back there, waiting.

583
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,357
Thank you for helping them, Anthony.

584
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,273
Was that your reason for coming?

585
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,268
I'm so afraid.

586
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,233
I am afraid for them and for us.

587
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,635
The walls are so far.

588
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,037
There's nothing for us to be afraid of.

589
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,754
That is what is tearing at me.

590
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,348
They are the same as we are.

591
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:40,316
They want to live and be loved too,
and yet tomorrow they will risk it all.

592
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,520
You can't change that.

593
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:49,516
Anthony... I cannot keep my promise.

594
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,513
- You're not going with them.
- Yes.

595
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,837
- You can't do this. I won't let you.
- Anthony...

596
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:00,111
I've prayed I could stay with you.
I want to stay with you.

597
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:03,232
You must! You don't have to go with them.

598
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:07,069
One girl among 10,000,
what difference can it make? Why?

599
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:13,799
Because everything you mean to me,
and it is so much, is not enough.

600
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,911
I'm Spanish.

601
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,076
I'm part of Ávila.

602
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,190
You're part of me too.

603
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,312
For all my life.

604
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:30,434
But God help me, my darling,
I'm going with Miguel.

605
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,516
Juana.

606
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,354
Hold me, Anthony.

607
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,597
Tell me you know I cannot help myself.

608
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:44,075
Tell me you love me.

609
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:43,557
I did not think that you would come back.

610
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,232
I am here, Miguel.

611
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,556
It's a...

612
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:00,552
It's a sad thing that I could never
put into words what you mean to me.

613
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,156
Forgive me.

614
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,716
<i>(cheering)</i>

615
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,949
The guns are firing too slow.
Hurry them up.

616
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:17,958
Fall back. Mass your rifles in the square.

617
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:20,036
Fall back!

618
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,512
General!

619
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,311
- I said mass your rifles in the square.
- But, General...

620
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:32,192
Quickly!

621
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:51,437
Juana.

622
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:56,276
I'm sorry, Anthony.

623
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,356
I asked for too much.

624
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,675
You didn't.

625
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,237
I wanted to see Miguel in Ávila.

626
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:15,511
And to... to love you.
