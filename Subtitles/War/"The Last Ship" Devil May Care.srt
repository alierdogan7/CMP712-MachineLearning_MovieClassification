00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:00,958
That's what's left
of their South Sea fleet.

181
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:02,820
Four ships against one.

182
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,537
Those are tough odds, even for you.

183
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,839
We never broadcast our position.

184
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,375
How did they know we were coming?

185
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,876
Chandler: It was the smart play.

186
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,879
This is the only refueling port
within 1,000 miles.

187
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:20,018
Damn it.

188
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:26,923
Fuel's at 21%.

189
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,557
Not enough to get us back to Okinawa.

190
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:30,537
Well, even if we got to Japan,
we'd have no backup,

191
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,273
and Peng is getting
exactly what he wants.

192
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,941
All of our ships are out of the region.

193
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:36,810
I'm not so sure that Peng's
behind the kidnapping.

194
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:38,145
Danny: He's got four warships

195
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,613
that are blocking our only hopes
of finding them.

196
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:42,082
Oh, I'm not saying
that he doesn't want us dead,

197
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,385
but Peng and the pirates
make strange bedfellows.

198
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:46,119
Maybe they have different agendas.

199
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,620
Didn't Peng call the President

200
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:49,923
to pledge his full support
in rescuing our crew?

201
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,192
Why don't we ask POTUS
to demand he clear the blockage?

202
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:54,994
Force his hand
and then see where he stands.

203
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:57,297
And then Peng says yes
and then during the refueling,

204
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,432
the James accidentally goes up in flames

205
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,000
and he pins it on the pirates again.

206
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,522
Agreed.

207
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,252
The President shouldn't ask
Peng for the fuel.

208
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,842
We should.

209
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,345
We call him ourselves?

210
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:15,314
No, that'll just give
his warships our location.

211
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,961
Jesse'll fly us into Hong Kong.

212
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,516
We can be inside his mansion
in just under two hours.

213
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:23,214
Well, we will certainly have
a lot to discuss.

214
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:27,624
Sorry, sir. Are we talking about
what we're talking about?

215
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,827
We're gonna break into the headquarters

216
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,329
of the Chinese President.

217
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,702
What are we looking at
in terms of security?

218
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:43,214
Uh [Sighs] dozens of armed
guards posted inside and out.

219
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:46,509
Each room and hallway requires key
card access, also CCTV security.

220
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:48,645
Val hacked into Peng's security system

221
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,080
when we were at the mansion.

222
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,915
We can own the cameras and doors.

223
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,149
That'll get us inside.

224
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,950
CIC can keep eyes on you from the sky.

225
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,585
That still leaves the guards.

226
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:59,055
Not sure how many we can drop
before alerting the rest of 'em.

227
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,589
We do this right, nobody gets killed.

228
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm not giving Peng an excuse
to start an all-out war.

229
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,329

[Door opens]

231

It's one thing
to go hunting for pirates,

232
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:23,038
but pulling Peng out of his bed
in the middle of the night...

233
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,114
How are you going to get
the President to sign off on this?

234
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,517
A rogue Navy captain with a hero complex

235
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,853
driven mad by the loss of his shipmates

236
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,988
takes matters into his own hands.

237
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:36,724
That's the story you'll have to tell

238
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:39,126
if this operation does not
go as I've planned.

239
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,820
You can't be serious.

240
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,997
I wanted to tell you personally
and privately, sir,

241
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,766
so I can prepare you for the worst.

242
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,901
The worst being we lose the hostages

243
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:50,203
and start a war with China?

244
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,968
It's important you maintain deniability.

245
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,167
I'm willing to take the heat, sir.

246
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,476
- Jesus, Tom.
- There are no other options, sir,

247
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,779
not if we want to rescue the hostages

248
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:01,046
by Takehaya's deadline.

249
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:03,314
This way, we get the fuel we need

250
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,218
and we get answers from Peng
about what's going on.

251
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,186
I need to hear from you

252
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:11,189
before the 36-hour deadline, either way.

253
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,425
You will, sir. Thank you, sir.

254
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,098
The President's a good man,
and he knows how important it is

255
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,328
to keep the people informed.

256
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:25,269
The first thing he did before
we even landed in St. Louis

257
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,304
was start broadcasting
to the American people.

258
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:28,672
I heard the broadcasts from Jackson,

259
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:29,640
and I know the legend.

260
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,521
It's not a legend. It's the truth.

261
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:33,221
I appreciate that.

262
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,879
Then why do you go after him
like he's some sort of criminal

263
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:39,115
while my friends are being
held captive 10,000 miles away?

264
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:41,284
I get that you're enamored with the guy,

265
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:42,618
but you've been in your own

266
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,478
little bubble with him for awhile now.

267
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,193
Out here in post-plague America,

268
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,541
there are real concerns
about the new President.

269
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,648
And I'm not just talking about
this hostage situation.

270
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,230
Well, then, people have
a pretty short memory.

271
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,271
They remember the fall
of the last government

272
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:55,588
and how it felt to be abandoned.

273
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,248
Let's face it.

274
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,513
It is one thing
to come home with a cure.

275
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,319
It's another to rebuild a country

276
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,221
and take on the rest of the world.

277
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,060
Moses delivered his people from slavery

278
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,026
and brought back the word of God
from the mountaintop,

279
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,795
and even he wasn't allowed
into the promised land.

280
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,317
You know, you're smart.

281
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,375
And you keep everybody on their toes,

282
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,662
and that's a good thing.

283
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:24,847

with your role in all of this.

00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,317
There's no Watergate.

286

You're not Woodward and Bernstein.

287
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:36,082

a carefully thought-out idea

288

about how to repair this country.

289
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,692
The last thing anyone needs

290
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:42,195
is you trying to tear him
and this government down.
