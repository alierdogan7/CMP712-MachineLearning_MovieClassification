[car horns honking]
(people chattering)

2
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:46,534
Thank you.

3
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,754
Good afternoon.  
Do you have a reservation for me?

4
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:06,048
My name is Shade.

5
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:21,464
Thank you, sir.

6
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:33,204
Hello?

7
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,764
-Yes?
-(over phone) There is no reply from Miss Tozer's room.

8
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:42,765
I see.

9
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:50,422
-(over phone) May I help you?
-No, I'll, uh, I'll find her later. Thank you.

10
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,313
[door creaking]

11
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,593
[gunshot]

12
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,358
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

13
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:41,833
-I'm looking for Miss Eve Tozer.
-Oh, uh, try over there.

14
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,651
Thank you.

15
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:49,494
The only explanation I could think he's a married man.
And I kept saying, "Darling, I can't possibly accept this.  I just can't"

16
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,938
-He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.  He wouldn't take--
-Excuse me.

17
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:56,614
(Screams)
Ah, Charlie Shade!

18
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:00,739
What a surprise!  How the hell are you?

19
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,894
-Could I have a word with you for a moment?

20
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:07,571
Uh, yes.
Sure. Excuse me, just for a minute.

21
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,492
Now... what is going on?

22
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:14,567
It has to be something, to get you out of that cubby hole in London.

23
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:23,543
-Where is your father?

24
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:27,056
-He hasn't written me in over three years.

25
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:31,522
The last I heard, he was on a retreat or something
in Afghanistan.  Why?

26
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:36,923
-Bentik, has influenced a judge in London
to declare your father dead

27
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:41,781
-What?!
-Now, I got a three week stay

28
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:46,205
but there are only 12 days left.
If Bradley Tozer does not appear

29
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:49,378
within a British court, within that time.
You will lose everything.

30
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,292
-But, why?!

31
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:55,870
-The original agreement between
Bentik and your father stated that

32
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,704
in the event of death, the company's
assets would revert to the surviving partner

33
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,481
-That's ridiculous!
-Shhh.
-Charlie!

34
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:06,301
Daddy never would have done
anything like that to me.

35
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,631
-The agreement was drawn up
before you were born.

36
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:17,260
-How am I going to live without money?

37
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:23,358
-Well, you could sell your jewelry. You
could live happily for the rest of your life.
-Oh, Charlie, you know the way I spend money,
it wouldn't last me a year.

38
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:27,572
Well, we just have to find him
and get him back to London, don't we?

39
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,923
12 days?
-Yes.

40
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:35,708
-Stay right here. Don't move.

41
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,709
Which one of you

42
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,710
would like the honor

43
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:43,013
of loaning me an airplane?

44
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:46,577
-The RAF would be delighted to
lend you an aircraft, Miss Tozer.

45
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:49,103
[Kissing sound]
I'll have it back in two weeks.

46
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,598
-Oh, wait a minute! I thought
you meant just for the night.

47
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,290
Terribly sorry.

48
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:59,229
-Anyone else?

49
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,633
No champions?

50
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:10,398
So long, boys.

51
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:17,975
-Can I see you for a minute?
-Excuse me, Charlie.

52
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,724
Alright, Lina, what have you got?

53
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:20,725
-Well... you've got to promise me

54
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,585
not to say a word to anyone,
especially my husband.

55
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:27,554
-Lina, darling, you know
you can trust me.

56
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,206
-Promise?
-On my honor.

57
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,706
-'Fraid that's not good enough.

58
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,247
-I promise.
-Okay.

59
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:37,122
Two miles northeast of town
on the Zheng Paul road

60
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,183
you'll find an airfield.
Ask for O'Malley.

61
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,548
Some kind of war hero.

62
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,748
Anyway, now he gives
flying lessons.

63
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:47,454
-Is that what you call it, dear?

64
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,514
-You promised, remember?
-My lips are sealed. Thank you.

65
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:53,325
-If it's really urgent, you'll find him

66
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:56,263
every night, at the Blue Nile club.
Can't miss him.

67
00:07:56,264 --> 00:08:00,294
Dark hair, dark eyes.
About 6'4".

68
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:04,535
-Sounds big.
-Yes, he's big.

69
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:08,192
-Come on, O'Malley. Come on, boy.
That a boy.

70
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:11,569
That's it.
Put the arm around me.

71
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,877
Walk.  Walk, one foot.

72
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,777
That's it.
The other foot.

73
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:20,279
Ah, look, he's walking.

74
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,025
-Did I drink too much, Struts?
-No, no.

75
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:28,016
-Let's get another drink.
-We're broke O'Malley.

76
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,708
-Oh, I hurt your suit.

77
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,299
You know what, Struts?

78
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,996
I got a feeling Lady Luck
is just around the corner.

79
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:42,584
-O'Malley!

80
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:43,631
-What?

81
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:46,058
[punch landing]
-Stay away from my wife!

82
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,372
-Get outta here, ya rotten bum.

83
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:54,274
Come on, baby, come on, for papa, huh?
Come on.

84
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,540
-Excuse me?

85
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,508
Is your name O'Malley?

86
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:04,517
-That's O'Malley.
[O'Malley groaning]

87
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:09,058
[Rooster crows]

88
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:35,399
Wake up!

89
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,251
Wake up!

90
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,622
Damnit, this is ridiculous!
[splashing]

91
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,043
-Carlos!

92
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:02,517
Carlos!

93
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,740
-Hold on.  Right under there.

94
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,197
Don't let it go. Whatever you do
don't let it go. Hold, hold, hold!

95
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,868
See? He's up. He's up. He's up
and around,

96
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,889
he's going to be well again.
Everything is fine.

97
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,536
He's got great recuperative power.

98
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:16,551
[Clanging]
-Mr. Struts!

99
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:19,284
Come quick! Come quick!

100
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,951
-Excuse me.

101
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,669
(in background)
Now what have you broken this time?

102
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,213
-Mr. O'Malley?

103
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:31,755
I really think you should reconsider.

104
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,437
Surely we can find someone else,
besides this... person.

105
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:40,776
-I already have reconsidered, Charlie.
And, I don't see that we have any choice.

106
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:48,040
I hear you give flying lessons.

107
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,354
-Not today.  I'm hungover.

108
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:55,411
-Beat up is more like it.

109
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:01,576
I wanna rent your planes for
the next two weeks.

110
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:07,115
-Oh, really? What for?

111
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,895
-Ten thousand pounds.

112
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:14,315
And I supply the fuel.

113
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:19,700
[chuckles
-Ten thousand pounds? Okay,
what do you want to do with them?

114
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,668
-I want to fly them to Afghanistan.

115
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:30,402
-It's a little early in the morning
for this kind of nonsense, isn't it?

116
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:34,095
Besides, my friend here is a mechanic,
not a pilot.

117
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:37,402
-So?
-So who's going to fly the other one?

118
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,159
-I will.

119
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,915
-You ever flown one of those kites?

120
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:51,923
-You ever shave?

121
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,225
-Oh boy.

122
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,028
Okay.

123
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,419
Come on.

124
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,051
-Please, Miss Eve.
You're taking a terrible risk.

125
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:11,132
-Oh, Charlie, I'll be fine.
Here, hold this, will you dear?

126
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,741
-Here.

127
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:24,055
-Hey, um, hold on to this, kid.
Ah, the hell with it.

128
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,303
Hey, what are they doing?

129
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:31,385
-I'm not quite sure.
But, I think they're going to fly.

130
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:33,075
-Get in.

131
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:34,439
-Excuse me.

132
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
[O'Malley belches]

133
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,501
-Is he alright in that condition?

134
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:53,854
-Oh, ho, don't worry.
He's alright in any condition.

135
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:20,339
-Take it, kid.

136
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,130
-Mr. Struts!

137
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:10,038
-He's an ace!

138
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:23,559
Hey, kid, what'd I tell ya?
O'Malley's a great pilot, huh?
-Yeah!

139
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:32,259
-Perfect.

140
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,286
-Was it alright?
-It's swell.

141
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:48,465
This one'll do.
It takes alot of punishment.

142
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,451
-What about Mr. O'Malley?
-He'll go along.

143
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,859
Do you have five pounds, darling?
-I never saw you do a twist

144
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,429
in a double loop before.
Especially, with a cracker of a hangover.

145
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,197
It was great.

146
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,824
-Here you are, Ace.

147
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:05,491
Now. This, is for the flying lesson.

148
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:07,847
You get the rest when we arrive
in Afghanistan.

149
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:09,833
-Afghanistan?
-That's right.

150
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,965
-Come on, lady, will ya?
-Tozer. Eve Tozer.

151
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:18,991
-The society dame?
-So, what, do we have a deal?

152
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,204
-I'll say one thing for you. You
are determined.

153
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,234
But, you got more money than sense.

154
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:28,654
Look, you fly better than a quart of gin.
But Afghanistan...

155
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:32,343
-Waziristan, to be exact.
-Either way! It's over 1,200 miles.

156
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:34,622
What the hell's a dame like you
want to go there for?

157
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:39,271
-I am looking for my father, Mr. O'Malley.
He was headed in that direction
when he disappeared.

158
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,434
-Ohh, you're crazy.  Go hire yourself a
couple of camels, I wanna drink.

159
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:47,148
-Don't blow it, O'Malley. Don't blow it!
-Blow what? The dame's nuts.

160
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,626
-She may be nuts, but she's rich.

161
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,203
-It could be very dangerous up there.
-Charlie.

162
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,149
Mr. O'Malley.

163
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,126
Mr. O'Malley. The only thing that I can't buy
is time,

164
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,194
and you have the only two available
planes in the territory.

165
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:02,933
Now, you're probably a damn good pilot.
-Ah, come on, lady. The Waziris are at
war with the British.

166
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,503
-Well, we'll tell them we're Americans.

167
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,671
-That's right, we're Americans!

168
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:09,879
-And if they shoot first?
-I'll take that chance.

169
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,799
-Good. You take that chance.

170
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,193
-Alright. You can have another 10,000 pounds
for dangerous natives.

171
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:20,700
-And what if there's no place to land?
-Another 5,000 ought to cover any damages.

172
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:23,500
-That's fair.

173
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,312
-Then there's the plague.

174
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:37,822
-And another 5,000 for the plague.
That's 30,000 pounds, Mr. O'Malley.

175
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,471
-Unh-unh.

176
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:45,166
You can't buy me, kid.

177
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:50,116
-Ah, we have a man of principle here, Charlie.

178
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:53,326
Alright. I double my offer.

179
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,438
60,000.

180
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:02,502
Pounds.

181
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:06,458
[Mouthing "pounds!"]

182
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,453
-Lady...

183
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:20,587
You just bought yourself one slightly used flying instructor,
and one ace mechanic.

184
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,457
I want half the money now!
And the other half in the London bank.

185
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,461
-No, Mr. O'Malley.
We'll give you 5 percent now.

186
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,082
And the rest in a Swiss bank.
-Deal.

187
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,161
-Pay them, will you Charlie?

188
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:40,633
-Take care of her, Mr. O'Malley.
-Charlie!

189
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:44,772
Yah-ha ah-ha-ha! We're rich!
We got it, it's all ours!

190
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,918
Everything we want!
[Laughing]

191
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,221
-Come.

192
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:53,442
-It's---
-You still got the Louis guns, Struts?

193
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,901
-Yeah, what for?
-Well, you better mount 'em.

194
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:59,582
If we're going to Afghanistan,
we're going to need 'em.

195
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:03,382
-Guns?
[cork pops]

196
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,737
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
Careful with the champagne, Tom.

197
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,917
-Yes, madame.

198
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:17,103
-Before I leave for London, I'm going
to have a word with the manager.

199
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:21,960
That bill is really far too high.
I'm sure they've cheated us.

200
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:28,081
-Charlie, worry, worry, worry.
-But your father would never forgive me, if anything
happened to you.

201
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:31,436
-You know me, I'm going to be fine.
-You've got to look after yourself!

202
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:36,793
Give Bradley my warmest regards when you see him.
-Absolutely, now give me a kiss.

203
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,875
Evie, look out!

204
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,426
-Charlie! Charlie!

205
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:47,651
[Car starts]

206
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,419
[honking horn]

207
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:17,994
[machine gun fire]

208
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:22,180
You'll see.  You just mark my words,
we'll be nursemaids all the way there and back.

209
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:25,226
-She's okay, she's a good kid.

210
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:28,010
Just got a lot of spunk, that's all.
-Spunk?

211
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,683
She's a rich, spoiled brat!
If you don't watch out, she'll get us all killed.

212
00:19:32,684 --> 00:19:35,430
-Hey, come on, O'Malley. Don't blow
this one, huh?

213
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:39,656
If she comes through with just part
of the dough, it'll bail us out and get us back to the States.

214
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:47,516
-Mr. Struts! Mr. Struts! Lady's coming.
-Alright, kid, come on, get off the plane.

215
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,549
-Let's go, Mr. O'Malley.
-What's the hurry?

216
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,233
-It's after 3 o'clock.

217
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:03,050
-Okay, so it's after 3 o'clock. So what?
This isn't a train station you know.

218
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,878
-What the hell's going on here, O'Malley?
-Let's go, Struts, let's go!

219
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:15,031
-Get off the field kid.
-Get out of here kid! I don't want you getting hurt!

220
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:43,848
-Wonder whose husband that was.

221
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:54,932
-Mr. Bentik. Mr. Bentik. Mr. Bentik, I-

222
00:20:54,933 --> 00:21:00,681
Ah, yes, Mr. Bentik. Mr. Bentik, sir.

223
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,546
-What is it?
-I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but

224
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:07,244
our agents have been unable to stop
Charlie Shade from contacting Miss Tozer.

225
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:09,361
-What?!
-The girl's escaped!

226
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:12,305
She's hired two planes and they flew off!
-Flew off?! Flew off where?!

227
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,025
-Well, our agents aren't sure. They tried to contact
an Arab boy who works at the Aerodrome.

228
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:22,697
-Well, stop her! That girl must not be allowed
to reach her father! Stop her, don't just crouch down there!

229
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,979
Stop her! Stop her!

230
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,297
Hopeless.

231
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,550
Lucky I had the old, uh, girl to chat with me.

232
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:38,789
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes, what is it?

233
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,125
-There are two unidentified aircraft approaching.
-Really?

234
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,854
Extraordinary.

235
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:49,908
Oh, well, I can have a look, I suppose.
Excuse me, chaps.

236
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:03,613
-Get my driver.
-Sir.

237
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:35,001
-I'll do the talking, I want to get
us out of here as soon as possible.

238
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:38,300
-They find out where we're headed,
they'll stop us.

239
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:42,466
-I'm not a fool, Mr. O'Malley.
-We need fuel and supplies, I'll handle this.
I know the army.

240
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:46,037
-Yes, but I know men. So, kindly stay out of it.

241
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:47,069
-I say, look here.

242
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,431
Do you both realize you're trespassing
on his majesty's property?

243
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:52,575
-Yes, well we--
-Major O'Malley.

244
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:55,943
Who's your C.O.?
-My God.

245
00:22:55,944 --> 00:23:01,210
O'Malley.
Ha, you don't remember me, do you?

246
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:04,516
Johnny Silversmith. 24th.
How are you?

247
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:08,424
-Sure, sure, Silversmith. Still
collecting army pay?

248
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:11,605
-That's right. You gave us a bit of
a surprise for a moment.

249
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,815
Thought you might be somebody
dropping in from HQ,

250
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:16,903
to give us a bit of a spot-check.
Not to mention the bloody Waziri.

251
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,642
They're giving us plenty of headaches, recently.

252
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:22,492
Wiped out a column of men last week.
-Never stops, does it?

253
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:26,770
Listen, I thought we might be able
to buy some petrol, to get us back.

254
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,797
-Yes, I think that might be possible.
Where are you going?

255
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,921
-Well--
-Mr. O'Malley has been kind enough
to show me the sights.

256
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:33,293
How do you do? I don't believe
we've been introduced.

257
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,417
My name is Eve Tozer.

258
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:37,150
-How do you do?
-O'Malley.

259
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:39,929
-What a pretty fort.
-Yes, it is pretty, isn't it?

260
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,197
-I imagine it must get awful lonely
here though.

261
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:44,877
-Oh, it's not too bad really. One
gets the odd London paper

262
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:46,698
and a bit of mail from
time to time.

263
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:48,516
One survives.
-Well, that's something, isn't it?

264
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:51,963
Uh, tell me, is there someplace
that I could tidy up?

265
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,622
-Yes of course.
Better come along with me.

266
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:57,690
I, uh, do hope you'll be able
to join us for dinner.

267
00:23:57,691 --> 00:24:00,437
-Oh, isn't that sweet of you?
I'd absolutely love to.

268
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,064
-Good, come along with me.

269
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:14,142
-Jesus, Ace.
-It wasn't funny at the time.

270
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:16,639
It wasn't funny at all.

271
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,908
We dive. Straight down.

272
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,809
And then old Dickey,
God rest his soul,

273
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,527
he took out the gun...
-Tell you about this magnificent evening

274
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,701
I spent with Tuppy Robertson.
I hadn't seen her for years.

275
00:24:25,702 --> 00:24:27,618
Very dear old friend.
-Tuppy?

276
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,330
-Tuppy Robertson. Very, very
dear old friend of mine.

277
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:32,949
And I was in London, and he
telephoned me one evening.

278
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,511
Said, would you like to
come to the theatre?

279
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:37,210
And I said Tupps this is, this is
a magnificent idea.

280
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:41,576
-...so hard I thought she was
gonna break in two.

281
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:46,599
When I pull out of it, I got
that third son of a Hun, right in the belly.

282
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:01,324
-Tell us about Verdun, sir.

283
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,154
-Verdun?

284
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:06,587
-The captain said that you got
12 kills in one week.

285
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,328
Is that true then?
-Yeah.

286
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,464
Yeah.

287
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:14,869
Sure, that's right. I did.

288
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,362
Sent schoolboys into the air,
who couldn't even do a loop.

289
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:23,076
I got a medal for that one.

290
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:25,027
You see, that's all the Germans
had left

291
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:27,466
to send up against us,
were kids.

292
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:30,216
They should have been home
going to school.

293
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,990
Wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

294
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:46,431
Want to know what else?

295
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,999
If you get close.

296
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,729
Really close.

297
00:25:56,635 --> 00:26:01,319
You see the fear on their faces.

298
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:09,876
-Remember Ellis, in Paris?

299
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:12,929
This guy put away 32 pints
of Guinness without

300
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,096
taking a piss on
Independence night.

301
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:26,355
-Darling, I'm absolutely fascinated.

302
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:29,236
Could you just hold that thought
one minute? Excuse me.

303
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:33,104
-Sounds jolly dangerous, sir.
-Nah it's a piece of cake, right Struts?

304
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,902
-Excuse me.  Mr. O'Malley.
-What?

305
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:38,997
-I think you've had quite
enough to drink for one

306
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,646
evening, don't you?
-I don't need you to tell me

307
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:42,888
when I've had enough.
-Well, as your employer--

308
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:44,088
-Piss off.

309
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:46,082
-Well, I say, O'Malley, that's really
just a bit too much.

310
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,422
-Maybe we ought to get a
little shuteye.

311
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,144
-Listen, ace. I don't buy all this
phony garbage that you're

312
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:55,098
handing out around here.
-The only phony around here
is the one I'm looking at.

313
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,358
All you rich bitches are the same.

314
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,359
-Oh, don't give me that, O'Malley. The
only reason you're here is because of money.

315
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,923
-You're damn right it is. For all
I care, you can take your money and shove it.

316
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,181
-Hey, come on, O'Malley. Let's get
back to serious drinking, huh?

317
00:27:09,182 --> 00:27:12,858
-Mr. O'Malley. I will be leaving
first thing in the morning.

318
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:16,573
With, or without you.
-[belching]

319
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,726
-You're disgusting.

320
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,197
-Thank you, ma'am.

321
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,274
-Morning.

322
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:37,938
All gassed up and ready to go.

323
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,868
-Mr. O'Malley?
-He's ready too.

324
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:42,029
[snoring]

325
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,872
-O'Malley, come on baby, wake up.
O'Malley, wake up, come on.

326
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:51,354
-Where am I?
-Ft. Kipling.

327
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:54,983
-Oh yeah. That's right.

328
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:59,204
-I made a fool out of myself
last night, didn't I?

329
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,811
-You've done worse.
-Where is she?

330
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:04,626
-In your plane. You, uh, okay?
-Yeah, I'm alright.

331
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:08,456
I'm fine, let's go.

332
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:13,534
Hey!

333
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:17,128
Right on time!

334
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:43,766
-Mr. Bentik.

335
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,667
They've contacted that Arab lad.

336
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:48,796
They think the girl is going
to Waziristan.

337
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,489
-Where is Waziristan?

338
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,863
-Afghanistan.
-Well, of course I know that.

339
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,300
Whereabouts in Afghanistan?
Never mind.

340
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,958
Contact all my agents in the district.

341
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:00,082
Tell them that girl must be
stopped, at all costs.

342
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,161
-But, we don't have any agents
in Afghanistan, Mr. Bentik.

343
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:04,354
The Waziris killed them all.

344
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:08,668
-Nonsense.  Offer 100,000
rubies to the one who sees her.

345
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,862
-You mean "rupees"?
-I said "rupees"!

346
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:14,637
-Yeah, but that's only 23 pounds, Mr. Bentik.

347
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:17,937
-Very well, then. Make it
a million rupees.

348
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:21,841
Offer a million rupees.  Offer
them 10 million rupees.

349
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,317
-We don't have 10 million rupees, Mr. Bentik.

350
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:28,834
-I said offer them 10 million rupees. I didn't
say pay them 10 million rupees, you fool!

351
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:32,360
Why are you wearing that idiotic tie?

352
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:36,452
-Well, I thought that--
-Take it off at once!

353
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:11,240
-Couldn't you have a better
place to land?

354
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:16,531
-Wanna tell them we're American?

355
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:18,427
-Very funny.

356
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:22,346
-Which one is the Khan?
-He'll get here.

357
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,355
And when he does, I advise
you to keep your trap shut.

358
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,596
-Oh boy.

359
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:52,932
-Speak!

360
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:59,394
-We come here as friends.
-Friendship?! [spits]

361
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,512
We are at war with the English!

362
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:07,523
-The great and famous Suleman Khan
can see we are not soldiers.

363
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:09,921
-My people are angry at any white face.

364
00:32:09,922 --> 00:32:12,647
For years, they have been fighting
the British dogs.

365
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:15,362
This land, is our land!

366
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:16,526
Soon...

367
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:21,984
every English infidel will be dead.
-We're not English, we're American.

368
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:26,574
-Tell that woman to shut her mouth.

369
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,404
-Do as he says.

370
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:35,339
-I find her eyes objectionable.

371
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,220
-Lower your eyes.

372
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,400
Do it!

373
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:39,709
[slap]

374
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:45,084
-Very good.

375
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:48,530
I see you know how to treat women.

376
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,670
You will be my welcomed guests

377
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:53,418
for dinner.

378
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:57,773
-Does that mean he's going to eat us, or feed us?

379
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:01,309
[shouting in Waziri]

380
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:10,370
-I think you really enjoyed that.
-Get up. It wasn't bad.

381
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,641
-You gonna ask him about my father?
-When the time is right.

382
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:54,930
-Excuse me, we are looking for my father.
-Stop it.

383
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:57,410
-Silence!

384
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:16,736
[speaking Waziri]

385
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,840
Your woman

386
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:25,203
she, uh, shows some courage.

387
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:28,144
Let me see the photograph.

388
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,122
Ah, of course.  Him.

389
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,958
[Waziri]

390
00:34:43,587 --> 00:34:45,078
-He is dead.

391
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,944
-That's impossible!
-Quiet!

392
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,880
How did he die?

393
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:57,423
-Uh, th-th-there was an unfortunate accident.
He was blown up.

394
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:01,524
A valuable and interesting man.

395
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:03,869
He is dead.

396
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:12,186
I have given your presence here...

397
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:15,332
much thought.

398
00:35:17,393 --> 00:35:19,138
[Waziri]

399
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:24,370
We will talk about our plans for tomorrow.

400
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:26,569
-What plans?
-The English...

401
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,838
have been marching against me
form Fort Kipling.

402
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,318
My spies tell me they are camped
over the mountains.

403
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:33,780
With your flying ships...

404
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,913
we shall destroy them!

405
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:37,607
-How?

406
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:41,799
-I have wonderful explosives.
That you will drop from the air.

407
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,064
-Surely the wise and powerful Suleman Khan can
see that I have brought a woman on this journey.

408
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:50,144
And that it is a mission of peace.

409
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:55,253
-You refuse me?

410
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:58,530
-If I do?
[Suleman Khan laughing]

411
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:03,052
-You will not live to see the dawn!

412
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:06,356
I think you will do this for me.

413
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:09,979
Your friends will remain here.

414
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,000
Under my protection.

415
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:17,239
-I can fly off and leave them.
-My eldest nephew will sit behind
you in your machine.

416
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,242
Pointing his gun at your back.

417
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:23,381
I do not think you will fly away.

418
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,423
-You hold all the cards.

419
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,929
[Speaking Waziri]
[Waziris laughing]

420
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,402
[Singing Waziri]

421
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:26,502
[gunshots]

422
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,807
-Look, Miss. Maybe the guy was wrong.

423
00:37:52,808 --> 00:37:56,061
Maybe he got him confused with
somebody else.

424
00:37:56,062 --> 00:38:00,963
I mean, it's hard to recognize someone
just from an old photograph.

425
00:38:04,306 --> 00:38:07,154
-I don't believe he's dead.

426
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:22,056
[Waziri]

427
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:28,428
-My master's youngest brother would
like to buy this woman.

428
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:37,656
-That must be worth a fortune.
-Yeah, it's a fortune.

429
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:40,195
We could buy a whole new fleet
of planes with that.

430
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:44,299
Stocked with camels, a couple of new Avros.

431
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,557
That's worth a couple hundred-thousand
pounds, squirt.

432
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:55,385
-Do you really think that those people are
going to let you get out of here with that stuff?

433
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,082
[Shouting in Waziri]

434
00:38:57,083 --> 00:39:02,153
-[woman]You must not speak! This
is a matter between men.

435
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:13,109
-Tell the Frantjen Khan that I am overwhelmed
by his more than generous offer.

436
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,415
Tell him

437
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,728
Tell him that she has serviced me
faithfully for many years.

438
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:26,428
But that I will think it over
very carefully.

439
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,397
[woman speaking]

440
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:37,128
-We will return tomorrow for your answer.

441
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:39,485
-Wait, wait.

442
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:42,274
You still have my father's picture.

443
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:45,305
-Yes. I will bring it to you later.

444
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:47,823
-Is he alive?

445
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:50,272
-Yes.

446
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:06,328
-Jesus, O'Malley.

447
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:09,202
That don't sound like too good
an idea to me.

448
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:13,003
I mean he can't be that dumb.
-What do they know about airplanes?

449
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:16,501
To them they're just some kind of
a flying ship. You sit in it like a wagon.

450
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:19,203
-Supposing it does work, what happens then?

451
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:22,775
-You two run for the other plane and
I'll cover you.
-You'll cover us?

452
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:25,549
-Yeah.
-How?!

453
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,308
-Okay. Forget it. You two think
of something.

454
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,637
-Listen, O'Malley, I--
-Speak!

455
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,751
-Speak?!

456
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:38,461
If you or one more person tells me
to speak or to not speak

457
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:41,326
or to lower my eyes, I am
going to let you have it!

458
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,564
I don't care if you kill me,
I'm going to let you have it!

459
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:47,282
-What are you doing down there?
-I've come to help you.

460
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,510
-Help me? How?

461
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:52,486
-To escape. If you allow me, I want
to go with you.

462
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:56,393
-Hey, that's great. You don't happen to have
a couple of machine guns on you, do you?

463
00:40:56,394 --> 00:41:01,530
-Do you know if my father is here?
-No, he escaped. He has been gone for a year.

464
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:03,216
-Well, where's he gone?

465
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:07,720
-We spoke many times of my village, in Nepal.
He said he would go there when he left.

466
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,117
-Alright. Why didn't you go with him?

467
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:13,671
-I was captured four years ago, by
the Suleman Khan.

468
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:19,039
And my brother was killed. He was
tortured to death, while I watched.

469
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,826
I've been a slave here now, since then.

470
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,522
I wish I were dead like my brothers.

471
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:28,457
-Is there any chance that

472
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:32,924
you could get some clothes for these two?
Hats? Robes?

473
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:35,010
-Yes, I can.
-Okay.

474
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:40,823
-How far away from here is your village?
-Forget it. I know what you're thinking,
and you can just forget it.

475
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:44,702
-Listen, don't you tell me--
-Our deal was to get to Waziristan.

476
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:47,230
Nepal is on the other side of India.
-Our deal was to find my father.

477
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:51,545
-Finding your father has nothing to do with it.
I wasn't that drunk.
-You're always that drunk!

478
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:52,968
-Alright, hold it.

479
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:58,119
Why don't we just figure how to get out of here,
and worry about fathers and deals where it's safe.

480
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:11,215
-[sighs] Okay.

481
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:15,166
-These, are the explosives you will use
against the English.

482
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,895
My eldest nephew, and his gun,

483
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:24,113
he will see that you do it carefully. And
return, when you need more.

484
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,744
-Ah, no, no.

485
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:30,112
Your nephew here, can have the honor of
dropping some of these bombs himself.

486
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:33,626
[Waziri]

487
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:40,543
-No.

488
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:44,245
He must get in the front, so that I
can steer from the back.

489
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:50,199
-Remember, the English lives for your friends'.

490
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:59,506
-Could you please ask him to keep the gun
out of my face, until we're in the air?

491
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:04,803
Thank you very much.
Clear them away.

492
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:13,182
-We will celebrate your victory on your return.

493

Struts, come on.

495

-Look, I found a cannon.
-Great.

-Ah, shit! Men!

504
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:25,895
-Do you read me?
-Yeah, I read you, O'Malley.

505
00:47:26,398 --> 00:47:30,313
-You alright?
-We're fine.

506
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,257
Hey, O'Malley?
-Yeah?

507
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:37,093
-You were pretty good back there, Ace.

508
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,208
-Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.

509
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:46,185
-Alessa says, we should make Nepal in about
a day and a half.

510
00:47:46,186 --> 00:47:49,722
-No! We're going back.

511
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:52,509
No! Wait!

512
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:58,264
Wait! No!

[Train whistles]

515
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:17,729
-Mr. Bentik.
-What? What is it now?

516
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,114
-Excuse me, sir, but she's been seen in India.

517
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:23,014
-India?

518
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:27,693
You told me she was in Afghanistan!
-I know that, Mr. Bentik. But she's
been seen in India.

519
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:30,289
We have a definite report, she's on
her way to Catmandu.

520
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,737
-Are you trying to drive me insane with all these names?

521
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,136
-I'm just telling you what's in the reports.

522
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:39,767
-Where is she now?
-India. Going, it is believed, towards
Catmandu. That's in Nepal.

523
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,472
-I know perfectly well where Catmandu is.
Stop moving around.

524
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:45,367
Stand still! And pay attention.

525
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:49,106
Now, listen. You are to contact
Major Von Hess in Delhi.

526
00:49:49,107 --> 00:49:53,255
Tell him that whatever happens, he is to
intercept her in Catmandu

527
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,899
before she reaches her final destination.
-[man speaking indistinctly]

528
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,368
-How do I know her final destination, you
silly little twerp?

529
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:03,520
Don't ask asinine questions, do as you're told!

530
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:07,365
Why aren't you wearing a tie?
-I've run out of them, Mr. Bentik.

531
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:11,328
-Well, run out of here. Run!

532
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:32,455
-In there.

533
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:43,669
-Alessa. Would you ask her if my father is here?

534
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,553
-Ah, yes.
-Please.

[speaking other language]

536
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:54,875
-He is not here.

537
00:51:56,472 --> 00:51:58,389
-Thank you.

538
00:52:06,535 --> 00:52:10,291
-Any luck?
-No, he isn't here.

539
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,378
-How is she?

540
00:52:41,379 --> 00:52:49,429
-Ah, she's okay. A little fever, but mostly tired.
A good night's sleep and she'll be the same
sweet kid again.

541
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:52,171
-Yeah, disappointment can really wear you down.

542
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:55,587
-I could use a drink. Wonder what kind of hooch
these people brew.

543
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:57,229
-They don't.
-What?!

544
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,893
-They're Buddhists. Drinking alcohol is strictly
against their religion.

545
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:02,497
-No kidding?
-Yep.

546
00:53:02,498 --> 00:53:05,285
-They can't all be that religious.
-Ha!

547
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,582
-She's sleeping well now.

548
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,847
My mother says that her father was
here in the village.

549
00:53:10,848 --> 00:53:12,787
But he's now gone.
-Well, does she know where he's gone?

550
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:18,121
-No, she doesn't. But he spent many
hours with his friend. Maybe he can tell you.

551
00:53:28,546 --> 00:53:30,369
Grandfather Zura.

552
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:33,860
-Alessa, my child.
-These men would like to speak with you.

553

-Yes, yes.

554
00:53:35,636 --> 00:53:38,582
Come and sit down, Mr. O'Malley.

555
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,501
I expected you.

556
00:53:40,502 --> 00:53:44,352
News moves quickly in a small village.

557
00:53:45,284 --> 00:53:49,306
-We came to find out about a man
named Bradley Tozer.

558
00:53:49,307 --> 00:53:53,182
-It is his daughter that has come to find him.

559
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:55,066
-Yes.

560
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:57,771
Do you know where he is?

561
00:53:57,772 --> 00:54:02,799
-Some time ago, a group of people came
through a pass, in the mountains.

562
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,066
From the province of Shengzhou.

563
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:10,034
It is there, that he has gone.

564
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:15,572
-Zhejiang, that's on the other side of the
Himalayas, in China.
-Yeah.

565
00:54:15,573 --> 00:54:18,483
-A very dangerous journey.

566
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:25,844
I shall pray, to our lord, Buddha, that you
have safe crossing.

567
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:35,309
-Is there anything else you can tell us?

568
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,830
-The oxen are slow.

569
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:42,617
But the earth is patient.

570
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:58,710
-Thank you very much.

571
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,167

You son of a bitch!

586

Get away, just get away from me.

-Shut up, you witch!

-Don't flatter yourself, O'Malley. Nothing ever will.
I think you're disgusting!
-What the hell's going on?

-Would somebody tell me what the hell is going on?!

O'Malley! Wait a second!

Listen, I'm sorry I barked at you like that.

597

Alessa has just explained. It was just a shock.

598
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,725
Oh, for God's sake, O'Malley, would you slow down?!

599

-If...you'll...drop it!

600
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:33,055
-Drop it? I'm the one who's saying I'm sorry.

601
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:43,001

act all humble-like, and accept. Don't I?

Well, I don't want to do that, see?

-Okay.

-Where?
-It's through the mountains in Zhenjiang.
It's a province in China.

-Well, how soon before the planes can be ready
and we can get out of here?

-Hey, O'Malley, here she comes.

615
00:59:29,873 --> 00:59:32,888
-Just ignore her. Maybe
she'll go away.

616
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:40,189
-O'Malley, I want to talk to you.
-Don't bother me, I'm busy.

been bombed...

-Nah, you can dump it.

of a sudden...
-Will you two cut it out?

00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:58,996
-..you decide, that some mountains are too
tough for the likes of a poor little,
defenseless creature like me.

623
00:59:58,997 --> 01:00:00,933
Now, that is garbage, O'Malley!
It is unmitigated garbage!

624

If you would just listen to me, for once...
-Hey, O'Malley!

You hear something?

626

-Look, I put up the money for this trip. And
if you think that I'm gonna sit here, while

you something.

was that guy?

-Well, it might have been Bentik. You
know, the man who gets everything and--

Hold it.

-Yes, and I was gonna tell you that--

would go this far.

-Oh, that's a hot one. You never thought of
anyone else but yourself in your entire life.

657
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:39,376
You're nothing but a spoiled, snooty,
rich little brat!

658
01:04:42,023 --> 01:04:45,461
-I'll buy you another plane.
-You're damn right you will.

659
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:47,983
And that's over and above
the hundred thousand.

660
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,738
-Does that mean you're still going?
-Yeah, that's right, I'm still going.

661
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:52,144
But I'm going solo.

662
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:56,519
-No! No. I will not give you one penny
unless I go too.

663
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,201
-That's not part of the deal.
-So, sue me!

664
01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:02,267
-I don't have to sue ya. I'll wring your
scrawny little neck.

665
01:05:02,268 --> 01:05:06,050
-Oh, yeah, go on. Do it, do it, do it!

666
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:14,045
[O'Malley screams]

667
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:24,065
[screams again]

668
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:34,273
Look at my Dorothy.

669
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:40,308
Look at my Dorothy. And then, give me
one good reason why I should take you along.

670
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:43,400
-He's my father.

671
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:02,015
-Okay.

672
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,141
You got any more little surprises?

673
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:30,059
-You alright?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

674
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,588
How long you think it'll take us
to fix her up?

675
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:37,269
-Ah, everything's going to be okay.
It just needs a little patching.

676
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,417
This means you're going to go, huh?

677
01:06:40,418 --> 01:06:45,127
-Yeah, I got to.
-Her too?

678
01:06:45,128 --> 01:06:48,675
-Yeah.

679
01:06:51,327 --> 01:06:54,117
Listen, you going to be okay here
'til I get back?

680
01:06:54,118 --> 01:06:57,357
-I'll be right here.
-You'd better be.

681
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:59,539
-Hey, ace, uh,

682
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:04,415
would you do me a little favor, please?
-Yeah, sure.

683
01:07:05,265 --> 01:07:08,489
-Just remember that, uh,

684
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:15,414
remember, the ox is slow, but
the earth is patient.

685
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:26,369
-Mr. Bentik? Where is he?

686
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:35,613
Excuse me, sir.
-What is it?

687
01:08:35,614 --> 01:08:38,993
-Well, I-I've been in touch with Major
Von Hess' headquarters in Delhi.

688
01:08:38,994 --> 01:08:43,165
They've had no word from him. They
rather fear he may be... lost.

689
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,471
-How do you mean "lost"?

690
01:08:45,472 --> 01:08:47,603
-Well, they can't find his plane.

691
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:49,851
-Well, where did they lose him?

692
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:54,677
-If they knew that, Mr. Bentik, he- he
wouldn't really be lost. Would he?

693
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:57,995
-You alright?
-Uh-huh.

694
01:09:57,996 --> 01:10:00,557
[Shouting in Chinese]

695
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,353
-You speak English?

696
01:10:02,354 --> 01:10:06,141
-You are under arrest! Under arrest!
You come! Come!

697
01:10:06,142 --> 01:10:08,356
-He speaks English.
-Mm-hmm.

698
01:10:08,357 --> 01:10:12,285
-After you.
-Thank you.

699
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:41,141
-Up! Go, go!

700
01:11:12,522 --> 01:11:15,318
-Go!

701
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:30,742
-Sit! Here! You sit!

702
01:11:31,294 --> 01:11:34,230
You wait.

703
01:12:21,018 --> 01:12:23,721
-Daddy?

704
01:12:28,104 --> 01:12:31,183
Daddy!
-Baby!

705
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:37,076
-Daddy, I've been looking all over for you.

706
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:41,058
-Well, let's have a look at you.

707
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:45,069
This is China. My God, where
did you come from?!

708
01:12:48,683 --> 01:12:50,553
Jesus Christ, look at you.

709
01:12:50,554 --> 01:12:54,508
You're beautiful. You're grown
up. You're a woman.

710
01:12:54,509 --> 01:12:59,039
Oh boy, you look like your mother.

711
01:13:00,226 --> 01:13:03,476
-I do?
-You sure do.

712
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:07,120
How did you get here?
-By plane.

713
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:10,008
Oh! Come here a minute.

714
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:12,418
There's somebody I want you to meet.

715
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,842
Mr. O'Malley, this is my
father, Bradley Tozer.

716
01:13:16,843 --> 01:13:19,678
-How do you do? You look like
you're a long way from home.

717
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,096
-Nice to meet you... at last.

718
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:26,422
-Sit down, sit down, I want to look at you.

719
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:32,378
-Daddy, what the hell are you doing all
the way out here, in the middle of China?

720
01:13:32,379 --> 01:13:34,810
-Look around, you'll see there's a war going on.

721
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:38,166
Not much of a war, as wars go,
but it's a war.

722
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:42,738
You see, there's this local hoodlum,
he's been climbing this hill for 20 years.

723
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:45,430
First, he takes their food away. And
then he rapes their women.

724
01:13:45,431 --> 01:13:48,707
I hate to be the one to break tradition,
but somebody sooner or later,

725
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:52,008
gonna have to stop this.
-General!
[Speaking Chinese]

726
01:13:54,162 --> 01:13:58,280
-That's me. I'm the general. I don't know
why they call me General, but I kind of like it.

727
01:13:58,281 --> 01:14:03,595
Now, I gotta go with this guy. Don't you
people go nowhere, I'll be right back.

728
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:08,367
-He's wonderful, isn't he?

729
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:11,859
-Well, he's something else. I'll
give you that for him.

730
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,088
-You know, I think I'd actually forgotten
how wonderful he was.

731
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:19,205
Even when I was a little girl, he always
seemed to be rushing around,

732
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:20,823
or doing something important.

733
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:22,855
-Did you always call him "daddy"?

734
01:14:22,856 --> 01:14:25,055
-Yes, why?

735
01:14:25,056 --> 01:14:27,195
-No reason.

736
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,591
Look.

737
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:32,369
We don't have much time.

738
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:37,118
So, if you tell him right away, I'm gonna try
and fly out of here, before it gets too dark.

739
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:42,229
-Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. O'Malley.
I'm aware of that.

740
01:14:49,366 --> 01:14:53,504
-What's going on?
-He's moving his cannon.

741
01:15:04,951 --> 01:15:07,816
What should we do?
-Nothing.

742
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:10,459
Not a goddamn thing.

743
01:15:11,468 --> 01:15:16,384
You come with me.
Stay here and keep an eye on 'em.

744
01:15:16,928 --> 01:15:23,122
-Then we gas up overnight. Then
another day to Guilin.

745
01:15:23,123 --> 01:15:27,591
One more day to Hong Kong, if we're lucky.
Are you listening to this?

746
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:29,314
-Yes. Of course.

747
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:34,758
-That should give us an extra day to
get him into a British court.

748
01:15:34,759 --> 01:15:37,502
-Well, that's it. It's like I figured.

749
01:15:37,503 --> 01:15:39,704
He's moving his cannon.

750
01:15:39,705 --> 01:15:44,607
He's seen your plane. He's taken it as
some kind of an omen, and he's coming.

751
01:15:44,608 --> 01:15:47,586
Tonight, probably. Tomorrow morning at
the very latest.

752
01:15:47,587 --> 01:15:50,232
The two of you gotta get the hell out of here.
-But we just got here!

753
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:54,997
-I know, and you just gotta leave. You can't stay
here, it's dangerous. You might get killed.

754
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:59,387
-But we want you to come with us. I
came here to take you back.

755
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:03,608
-Nope. I can't go with you.

756
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:08,614
Take a look around. Do you see these people?

757
01:16:08,615 --> 01:16:12,467
These people need me.

758
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:17,318
It ain't gonna mean much, as far as
the world turning goes.

759
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:22,051
But, honey, there's battle's gotta be
fought. This may be one of them.

760
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:25,362
I'll bet you know what I mean, O'Malley.

761
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:29,174
-Yeah, I told myself that a couple of times.
-Sure you have. Everybody has.

762
01:16:29,175 --> 01:16:33,652
And I want to thank you for bringing
her all this way to see me. It means alot.

763
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:37,797
Now, do you want to do me a big favor? Load
her back in that plane, and get her back over

764
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:40,426
them mountains just as goddamn
soon as you can.

765
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:44,228
-Well, we can't leave until morning
anyway. It's too dark to fly.

766
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:48,745
-Alright.

767
01:16:48,746 --> 01:16:52,424
Come sunrise, you get in that plane.
You get the hell out of here.

768
01:16:52,425 --> 01:16:55,237
And no nonsense, you hear me?

769
01:16:57,019 --> 01:17:00,515
He's coming.

770
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:04,566
I'm ready for him! Now, Evie, you go
with Chenwa there. She'll show you

771
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:07,613
where you can clean up and lie down.
O'Malley, you're gonna come with me.

772
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:10,595
I'm gonna show you just how I'm gonna
whip this little bastard.

773
01:17:10,596 --> 01:17:13,089
-Oh, actually, I'd kind of like to clean up
and lay down too.

774
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:16,399
-Oh no, no, no, no. None of it, you come with me.
-Let me take your coat for you, O'Malley.

775
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,058
-[speaking Chinese]

776
01:17:18,059 --> 01:17:19,537
Off you go.

777
01:17:19,538 --> 01:17:25,233
O'Malley, you come with me. Now,
I built myself a foundry here.

778
01:17:25,234 --> 01:17:28,846
Mr. O'Malley, would you come
and walk with me?

779
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:32,189
-Sure
-Good, come on.

780
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:37,283
Like I said, I've set up a foundry here.
I'm trying to forge out a cannon.

781
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:40,034
It won't do a bit of good though, I've
got no copper.

782
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:43,220
I can't make no cases, therefore
I got no goddamn shells.

783
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:46,729
-No shells? Right. What good's a cannon
if you don't have any shells?

784
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:50,116
-Well, it's part of the game you see. These
people are peasants. They're like children.

785
01:17:50,117 --> 01:17:53,798
They figure this General Wang's got a cannon,
and they ain't got one.

786
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:56,250
Explosives. That's my game. That's
the ticket here.

787
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:59,922
I've set up 400 mines in front of this town,
just waiting for him to come across.

788
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:04,132
I'll blow him off the face of the earth.
I could whip this guy by myself.

789
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:07,352
[Chinese]

790
01:18:21,222 --> 01:18:23,945
-Let's get out of the gritty nitty.

791
01:18:23,946 --> 01:18:26,411
What are you and my daughter
really doing here?

792
01:18:26,412 --> 01:18:30,401
-Oh no, I think you better ask her that.
I'm just kind of the hired help.

793
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:33,116
-I got a reason for asking.

794
01:18:33,117 --> 01:18:36,307
Tell me what she's doing here.

795
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:47,055
-Well, your partner, or someone, is trying
to have you declared legally dead,

796
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:51,567
so he can take over your company. She just came
here to bring you back, before he could do it.

797
01:18:51,568 --> 01:18:53,246
-Bentik?
-Guess so.

798
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:57,351
-Well.. he's welcome to it!
What's left of it.

799
01:18:57,352 --> 01:19:00,882
I'm surprised he hasn't bankrupted already.

800
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:04,070
You see, all the formulas and patents are
in my name anyway.

801
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:08,118
If I'm declared dead, that stuff
all goes to Evie.

802
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,248
-What?
-Sure! He'll have the company

803
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:14,700
but she'll have all the real wealth.

804
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:43,839
-What's going on?
-I'm washing my feet. What does it look like?

805
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,477
-Well, get your things together. We're getting
out of here. What'd you do with my map?

806
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:50,783
-What do you mean "we're getting out of here"?
It's too late, it'll be dark.

807
01:19:50,784 --> 01:19:53,437
-Oh, come on. Look, kid, this is me you're
talking to now. We can be

808
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:55,553
a hundred miles away from here before
it gets too dark.

809
01:19:55,554 --> 01:19:58,008
-Yes, but you heard what my father said.
He won't come with us.

810
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:02,593
-He doesn't have to. He explained the whole
thing to me. You'll have as much money

811
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:04,517
as you ever had. Probably a hell of a lot more.
-You told him?

812
01:20:04,518 --> 01:20:06,316
-He asked me.
-What did you say?

813
01:20:06,317 --> 01:20:08,363
-What's the difference?
-What did you say?

814
01:20:08,364 --> 01:20:11,133
-Your money's safe. That's what you came
here to find out, isn't it?

815
01:20:11,134 --> 01:20:14,419
So, let's get out of here while we've still got
a chance. Come on, sit down. Get your clothes on.

816
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,275
What the hell'd you do with my coat?
-Well, what about him? If we leave, he'll

817
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:19,907
be all alone.
-He was alone yesterday. And the day before.

818
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:23,091
So what? He doesn't need us.
He's got his war.

819
01:20:23,092 --> 01:20:27,643
And you got your money. Now, if i can just find
my coat, it'll be a happy ending all the way around.

820
01:20:27,644 --> 01:20:29,791
-No.
-What?

821
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:33,348
-No.
-No what?

822
01:20:33,349 --> 01:20:36,740
-No, I'm not going.
Why can't we wait?

823
01:20:36,741 --> 01:20:39,292
-What for? He wants you to go!

824
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,432
He can handle all this without us. To
him it's just a turkey shoot.

825
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:45,487
-He's just saying that to protect me,
and make us leave.

826
01:20:45,488 --> 01:20:48,219
No, I'm not going without him, and
that's final.

827
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,088
-Final?
-Yes.

828
01:20:50,089 --> 01:20:53,782
-Final? You're nuts! I said it all
along. You're nuts. And now that

829
01:20:53,783 --> 01:20:56,048
I met your father, I can
understand why.

830
01:20:56,049 --> 01:20:59,265
Blood. Bad blood. You're nuts!

831
01:20:59,266 --> 01:21:02,954
Insanity runs rampant in your family.
Well, I'm getting out, you understand?

832
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:04,408
Out!

833
01:21:04,409 --> 01:21:08,072
-What about your coat?
-I don't need my goddamn coat.

834
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:13,384
-Well, go on then, leave! See
if I care. I hate you!

835
01:21:20,173 --> 01:21:22,024
O'Malley!

836
01:21:22,025 --> 01:21:24,634
O'Malley!!

837
01:21:29,265 --> 01:21:32,457
O'Malley, are you alright?

838
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:35,157
Oh my God, O'Malley, are you alright?

839
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:38,764
O'Malley, I'm sorry, I didn't mean what I
said.

840
01:21:38,765 --> 01:21:40,888
Please, O'Malley! I--
-Speak!

841
01:21:40,889 --> 01:21:42,655
-What?!

842
01:21:48,474 --> 01:21:50,273
You rat!

843
01:21:50,274 --> 01:21:53,566
You dirty rat!

844
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:56,089
Oh my God, I can't believe what a rat you are!

845
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:58,495
-Oh yeah?!

846
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:01,431
Well, what about you?!

847
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:03,561
What about my hundred-thousand?

848
01:22:03,562 --> 01:22:06,082
You think I'm going and you won't
have to pay me, don't you?

849
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:08,809
Well, you're wrong, see? I
want my dough, lady.

850
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:11,526
It's coming to me, and I'm not
going 'til I get it.

851
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:14,492
-You'll get it!
-You bet I will.

852
01:22:14,493 --> 01:22:16,904
-Why did you kiss me?

853
01:22:16,905 --> 01:22:19,329
-Because I felt like it.

854
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,734
-Here's your coat. The map
is in the pocket.

855
01:22:43,735 --> 01:22:45,675
We can leave tomorrow morning.

856
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:50,258
And as soon as we get to someplace that's remotely
civilized, I'll make sure that you get your money.

857
01:22:50,259 --> 01:22:54,335
And then it'll be over, alright?

858
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:59,078
-Yeah, sure. Suits me just fine.

859
01:23:25,309 --> 01:23:32,613
[singing together]
I didn't raise my boy to join the army.

860
01:23:39,445 --> 01:23:42,282
[Singing]
So take your wars away.

861
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:46,548
Leave my boy to me this day.

862
01:23:46,549 --> 01:23:55,004
I didn't raise my boy, to be a soldier.

863
01:23:55,619 --> 01:24:00,388
-Rest well, and get her out of here in the morning.

864
01:24:00,389 --> 01:24:02,568
-Are you sure you don't need my help?

865
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:05,610
-Bah, I could whip this bum in my sleep.

866
01:24:05,611 --> 01:24:09,314
-Right.
-Take care of yourself, and thanks for coming.

867
01:25:41,454 --> 01:25:43,785
[Shouting Chinese]

868
01:25:53,098 --> 01:25:55,611
-Hey!

869
01:25:59,629 --> 01:26:01,812
Hello!

870
01:26:17,429 --> 01:26:19,028
Where's Eve?

871
01:26:19,029 --> 01:26:22,243
-Ah, Jesus, O'Malley! I thought
you'd be gone by now.

872
01:26:22,244 --> 01:26:25,126
-Where's Eve?
-I don't know!

873
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:51,857
-Too soon! You're dropping 'em too soon!

874
01:27:01,613 --> 01:27:03,473
-Wait.

875
01:27:16,877 --> 01:27:20,475
It's okay. It's okay, just stay calm.

876
01:27:20,476 --> 01:27:24,134
Just stay calm. Now, wait!

877
01:27:24,135 --> 01:27:25,283
Wait!

878
01:27:25,284 --> 01:27:27,963
Now!

879
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:32,238
No!

880
01:27:38,434 --> 01:27:43,433
You dropped 'em too late!
You waited too long!

881
01:27:46,848 --> 01:27:48,306
Wait.

882
01:27:50,052 --> 01:27:51,610
Wait.

883
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,545
Do it, kid.

884
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:56,755
Do it.

885
01:27:58,053 --> 01:27:59,666
Now!

886
01:28:05,516 --> 01:28:07,350
Yeah!

887
01:28:07,351 --> 01:28:12,125
Come on up here now, you baby-raping
son of a bitch!

888
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:27,918
Come on, kid. Pull it up.

889
01:28:27,919 --> 01:28:31,229
-Alright, O'Malley! She got the
son of a bitch! She got that--

890
01:28:41,299 --> 01:28:44,107
Okay, now--
-Give me that!

891
01:28:44,108 --> 01:28:47,877
-You bring her back here!

892
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:04,236
-Eve? Evie?

893
01:30:04,971 --> 01:30:07,396
Evie? You okay?

894
01:30:07,397 --> 01:30:09,429
You hit? Evie?

895
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:12,254
Evie? Evie! Say something!

896
01:30:12,255 --> 01:30:14,542
-Speak!

897
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:18,070
-Speak?! I'll wring your neck!

898
01:30:18,071 --> 01:30:20,237
[Evie laughing]

899
01:30:23,530 --> 01:30:26,864
Speak? Very funny!

900
01:30:26,865 --> 01:30:29,302
Look at my plane! You wrecked it.

901
01:30:29,303 --> 01:30:33,230
-It was always a wreck, O'Malley.

902
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:41,221
-Down. Put your head down.

903
01:31:10,178 --> 01:31:12,059
Here, take this.

904
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,592
-Where are you going?
-To get the Louis gun.

905
01:31:14,593 --> 01:31:16,377
-It's empty!

906
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:24,069
This is empty too!

907
01:31:39,282 --> 01:31:43,526
-Now, when I fire the next time,
you start running.

908
01:32:18,231 --> 01:32:20,471
-Say Wong!

909
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:22,971
It's me, Tozer!

910
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:25,892
How do you do?!

911
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:38,449
-Keep your head down.

912
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:40,856
-What's going on?
-It looks like your father is starting

913
01:32:40,857 --> 01:32:44,423
his show. Here, wipe your face.
It's dirty.

914
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:53,190
-Wong!

915
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:02,279
Take that, you son of a bitch!

916
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:11,067
Wire them.

917
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:54,231
Hoist the colors.
-Yes, sir.

918
01:34:11,334 --> 01:34:14,012
-They're going.

919
01:34:14,013 --> 01:34:16,429
-What?

920
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,168
-Yeah.

921
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,932
It's over.

922
01:34:24,933 --> 01:34:27,989
I guess your old man won.

923
01:34:33,854 --> 01:34:35,244
Ha, yeah.

924
01:34:36,953 --> 01:34:39,530
Sure could use a drink.

925
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:43,255
-Make it a double.

926
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,936
-Well...

927
01:34:57,886 --> 01:35:00,749
Thank you, O'Malley.
-What for?

928
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:05,558
-For just about everthing, I think.

929
01:35:05,559 --> 01:35:09,258
For getting me here. For taking
care of me.

930
01:35:11,213 --> 01:35:14,090
-Uh.. sure, squirt. Any time.

931
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,363
Listen, you better go back. Your
old man might need you.

932
01:35:20,364 --> 01:35:23,335
-Oh, thank you.

933
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:30,407
What are you going to do?

934
01:35:30,408 --> 01:35:32,268
-Me?

935
01:35:36,114 --> 01:35:39,947
Well, I guess I'll just sit here
with my plane.

936
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:42,894
Figure things out.

937
01:35:43,469 --> 01:35:47,063
It's a long walk back to Nepal.

938
01:35:47,894 --> 01:35:50,424
-Yeah, it's mostly uphill.

939
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:54,667
-Yeah.

940
01:36:06,782 --> 01:36:08,447
-Well

941
01:36:15,716 --> 01:36:18,089
See you around, ace.

942
01:36:27,994 --> 01:36:29,925
-Hey!

943
01:36:45,611 --> 01:36:48,483
Come here a minute.

944
01:37:12,696 --> 01:37:15,002
Closer.

945
01:37:24,346 --> 01:37:27,525
Now...

946
01:37:27,526 --> 01:37:29,745
Put your arms around me.

947
01:37:39,302 --> 01:37:42,542
You know, I only made one real mistake.

948
01:37:43,503 --> 01:37:46,086
-What was that?

949
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:51,294
-I should have sold you when I had the chance.
