PAXTON: My father said the Army
makes all men one.

2
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,005
But you never know which one.

3
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:58,805
He didn 't know Roland Bozz.

Get up!

SGT. LANDERS: You got 1 5 minutes or
you'll do pushups until I pass out.

9
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:20,852
Let's go. Let's go.
Get up! Let's go!

10
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:23,928
Get your socks on and get outside,
you fucking pussies!

-Move!

12
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:30,444

SERGEANT MP: Next time won't be
no weekend in the stockade.

17
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,928
It'll be a full-scale
motherfucking court-martial.

18
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:04,214
Maybe a few years hard time in
Leavenworth. How's that fly, dipshit?

19
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:08,405
Discounting reception, basic training

Get up on that deuce, boy!

22
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,323
You don't need no special
invitation, son!

23
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:32,208
Do as I ask! Hoist that
GI ass on that deuce!

Private Bozz, Roland.
No middle initial.

26
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:48,093
You're going to infantry.

27
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,008
I bet my left nut
they bag and tag you in a week.

28
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:54,525
Any man tries that hard to get out
will never see home again.

29
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:57,408
I don't like the rehearsal,
so I'll skip the show.

30
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,010
Fuck you. Get on that deuce.
Let's go!

31
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:16,934
Bozz.

32
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:22,207
I got a buddy in Charlie Company
says he knows a fellow by that name.

33
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,965
Says he's the biggest fuckup
in the Army.

34
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:29,414
Clowning around and always acting
like fucking bozo.

WILSON: Article 1 5, recycled through
basic, all kinds of goldbrick shit.

36
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:39,405
Sounds to me like that fellow's
no more than a goddamn coward.

37
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,048
Afraid of Tigerland, huh?

38
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,404
WILSON:
Should be scared.

39
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,930
They hump your ass until it falls off.

40
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:50,649
-I heard a guy from Bravo died there.
-No, man, that's a rumor.

41
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:54,605
You afraid of big old Tigerland,
Private Fuckup?

42

I gotta get away from this guy.

Get back in that truck,

Good morning, gentlemen.

53
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,886
My name is Captain Saunders.

Third advance infantry

56
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:41,446
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.

57
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:45,614
No matter where you did your basic,
either Fort Polk or elsewhere. . .

58
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:49,086
. . .rest assured that we train the
proudest, the toughest. . .

59
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,853
. . .the best-equipped soldiers.

60
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:55,048
This base is the largest supplier
of combat troops overseas.

61
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,928
So don't let any man here
start having any little. . .

62

. . .pasty fucking daydreams
about being anyplace else.

63
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,854
I shit you not, gentlemen.

64
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,929
You are headed for
a two-way firing range.

65
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,205
You will be sent to the war.

66
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,134
You will be here for an
eight-week training cycle.

67
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,014
After that, you will remain here
for a week more.

68
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:17,213
We will ship you to an outpost
1 0 miles from here. . .

69
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:21,653
. . .that is known throughout the Army
as the second worst place on earth.

70
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:23,214
Tigerland.

71
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:25,923
It is the stateside province
of Vietnam. . .

72
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:29,133
. . .and it is as close to the war
as we can make it.

73
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:32,133
Now, gentlemen,
it behooves you to learn. . .

74
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,610
. . .what little we can teach you here.

75
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,931
For if you do, then maybe. . .

76
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:38,324
. . .just maybe. . .

77
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:42,608
. . .you will return one day to play
stink-finger with Sally back home.

Let's get squared away.

79

Those of you not on detail
will have a pass for the weekend.

80
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:49,810
Training begins Monday at 0430.

81
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,849
From that time on, every
son of a bitch humps his own load.

-You're right.

I'm no expert but it says
you're gonna have sex real soon.

-What about me?
-Sex for Sheri as well.

to piss everybody off.

die and I'd miss you too much.

-Okay.

-Upstate New York.
-New York.

How about you, Bozz?
Where are you from?

106
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:30,492
Texas, Jim. It's in the
Southwestern part of the U.S.

Oh, yeah? Well, I'll double-check
that on the map. Thanks.

-I'm surprised they let you off base.
-They didn't.

-Amen.

Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.

earth and a cure for cancer. "

-You're doing a routine.

about it, fuck you.

Then what is?

00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,485
The answer is, I got a hotel room.

and fuck till the war is over.

Under fire, you will fall

to remove your button. . .

00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,809
. . .if the Lord or God or Jesus. . .

334
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,210
. . .be standing here right now. . .

335
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,328
. . .he'd say, "Cantwell. . .

336
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,125
. . .you forget about
all these promises.

337
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:35,204
You forget about what all anybody say.

338
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:39,211
And you forget about all them
big Sunday fancy ideas.

339
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,214
Even what we tell you.

340
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:44,809
You look up there.

341
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,012
Did you ever see such a moon?"

342
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,013
Goddamn it, Cantwell.

343
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:55,604
Shit.

344
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,568
Shit.

345
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,209
Fuck, I don't even know you, man.

346
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,044
You sitting there
telling your fucking story.

347
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,008
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about?

348
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:15,203
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.

349
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,805
You shouldn't even be in this army.

350
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:23,004
You're just too stupid
to get yourself out.

351
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:25,013
I told them my predicament.

352
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:28,174
They said, "Wait till you go
to war, then complain. "

353
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:30,053
And you bought that?

354
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,564
The man said it.

355
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:34,892
I know Army regulations
the way prisoners know the law.

356
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:36,972
You're a hardship discharge, man.

357
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:43,292
Okay. Look, I'll get you
out of the Army.

358
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,009
What are you saying?
You don't care about him.

359
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:49,372
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.

360
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:52,089
Just peel some
fucking potatoes or something.

361
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,291
DRILL SERGEANT: One, two, three.
PLATOON: Two.

362
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:59,247
-One, two, three.
-Three.

363
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:01,491
-One, two, three.
-Four.

364
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:04,084
-One, two, three.
-Five.

365
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,333
Who put you up to this, son?

366
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:20,207
Nobody, sir.

367
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:22,766
-I know my rights.
-No, you don't.

368
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:26,809
Your case won't be reviewed until
after you're overseas. Dismissed.

369
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:31,687
No, sir.
I don't believe that's correct.

370
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:35,490
And I believe if you don't allow me
to see a J.A.G. officer, sir. . .

371
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:38,414
. . .then under the uniform code
of military justice. . .

372
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:41,413
. . .I can file a complaint
with the inspector general.

373
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:42,929
And nobody can keep me.

374
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:45,008
Jesus Christ!

375
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,491
When did "My country, right or wrong"
turn into "Fuck this"?

376
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:52,005
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.

377
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:55,409
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.

378
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:58,010
I read it. In a book.

379
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:04,889
You read it? ln a book?

380
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:07,008
Yes, sir.

381
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:09,212
How far did you get in school?

382
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,206
Almost sixth grade, sir.

383
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,805
I guess they study law early
where you come from.

384
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,127
SGT. THOMAS:
Sir, if I may speak frankly.

385
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,133
You underestimate the harm
someone like Bozz can do.

386
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,814
He's bad for the Army, sir.

387
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:30,008
CAPT. SAUNDERS: Everything's bad
for the Army these days. Even war.

388
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:34,606
Now drive your knee through his face.
Shove his brain through his ear. Good!

389
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:36,214
WILSON:
Thank you, sir.

390
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:39,448
What's your solution?
Shit-can him out of the Army?

391
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,845
Of course not. That's what he wants.

392
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:43,807
-Exactly.
-Court-martial him.

393
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,846
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.

394
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:48,489
Sergeant, you know we won't
court-martial him.

395
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,492
It'll cost beaucoup dollars. . .

396
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:54,483
. . .and battalion will ask why I can't
keep one asshole trainee in line.

397
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:57,448
Five weeks from now,
he'll be in the war.

398
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:00,965
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad. Sure as shit.

399
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:04,485
Maybe not. Got Cantwell out.
Two other guys from his squad.

400
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:09,086
Every son of a bitch J.A.G. shrink
bleeding heart pissed down on us.

401
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:10,284
That's Bozz, sir.

402
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:12,963
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.

403
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:15,211
Sergeant, we are losing a war.

404
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:18,407
The whole goddamn Army
is falling apart.

405
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:22,324
You want me to fiddle-fuck around
with one smart-ass barracks lawyer?

406
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:24,412
I think he's something more, sir.

407
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:28,005
-Is that all, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

408
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,805
What the hell you doing, soldier?!
Goddamn it, Bozz!

409
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,325
You're supposed to strangle him,
not become his fuck buddy!

410
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,809
Yes, sergeant.

411
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:08,733
Pussy-fucking-coward.

412
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:13,485
What the fuck you looking at,
you bunch of no-nut sad sacks?

413
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:16,163
Get your little pussies back to work!

414
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,454
You try that again,
you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.

415
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,889
Now get those little pussies
back to work. . .

416
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:33,212
. . .you bunch of sad sack,
no-nut fuckups!

417
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:36,246
PAXTON:
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.

418
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:40,249
He's two-stepping from the poorhouse
with a crazy wife. I envy him.

419
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:41,808
You saved his life.

420
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,848
Shit, sometimes when we talk,
my stomach hurts.

421
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,808
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.

422
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,086
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.

423
00:26:50,295 --> 00:26:52,490
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.

424
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,084
Know what would settle your ass?
A blanket party.

425
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:57,763
Put a blanket over you,
hit you with a rock.

426
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:00,614
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.

427
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:03,124
-Both of you can walk back--
-You bastard. . .

428
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,212
. . .you think you so damn smart.

429
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,213
I hear Northern boys
are the first to go in Vietnam.

430
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:11,009
Yeah, but at least
we can find it on a map.

431
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,368
Real fucking funny, Pax.

432
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:16,408
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.

433
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:20,290
Ain't nobody gonna die? Shit, Miter,
you're one damn dumb cracker.

434
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:23,885
When you go home, they'll call you
"Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker. "

435
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:26,689
-That any better?
-You watch yourself, mister.

436
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,250
I still got these stripes.
Acting sarge.

437
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:32,367
You're chicken without
that stripe down your back.

438
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:36,568
-I ain't seen a dink that can take me.
-Jesus, Wilson, you a dumb-fuck.

439
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:39,164
Them motherfuckers
killed the Chinese ass. . .

440
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,730
. . .and the French ass.
They gonna kick ours.

441
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:46,645
-Who are you? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard"?
-My brother was there in '68.

442
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:48,248
Don't make you no hero.

443
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:50,605
You know what your problem is, Wilson?

444
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,974
You need to listen for the pop.

445
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:55,006
What's "the pop," Johnson?

446
00:27:57,495 --> 00:28:01,807
The sound you'll make when your head
exits your ass for the first time.

447
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:06,013
Damn, Johnson,
I know you a damn coward.

448
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:08,445
Now I believe you a damn communist.

449
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:12,045
Maybe a damn faggot alongside
being a goddamn nigger.

450
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,610
-Oh, hell no!
BOZZ: Ain't this some shit.

451
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,687
-Want a piece of me, chump?
SOLDIER: Get him!

452
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:21,487
SOLDIER: Get him!
JOHNSON: Get off of me.

453
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:26,134
Get off, motherfucker!

454
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,404
MITER:
Come on!

455
00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:30,014
That's enough.

456
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,613
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

457
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:35,604
(YELLING)

458
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,854
Which one of you motherfuckers
killed my truck?

459
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,647
SOLDIER: Get off me, man!
SOLDIER: Get off!

460
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,733
All right, now, you truckload of shit.

461
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,489
Fess up, or the whole
damn drag-ass squad. . .

462
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:51,812
. . .does the airborne shuffle
six miles back to base.

463
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:55,854
Goddamn it, shit for brains!
Who did it?

464
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:01,528
I did it, sergeant.

465
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,327
Good. Come down here, boy.

466
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:05,207
And bring your shit!

467
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:11,004
Rest of you, sit your asses down.

468
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:34,692
Nobody saves anybody,
you stupid son of a bitch.

469
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:36,931
What the fuck are you doing, man?

470
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,211
It's not doing me any favors.

471
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,730
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2.

472
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:51,290
Miter has properly demonstrated. . .

473
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:55,010
. . .the use of the TA-31 2 field radio.

474
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:59,004
Except for this,
which is not in the manual.

475
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,806
If you ever catch Charlie. . .

476
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:05,087
. . .you might want info on where
the rest of his buddies is.

477
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:09,846
Only Charlie is a close-lipped
bastard who won't tell you fuck all.

478
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:13,724
That's why you tie his gook hands,
take down his gook pants. . .

479
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:16,409
. . .and grab his gook balls.

480
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,573
Here, Miter, hold these.

481
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,847
You pinch these clips on each
of his slant-eyed nuts. . .

482
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:24,410
. . .and you juice up the radio. . .

483
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:31,450
. . .that'll send enough shock so
he'll tell you anything you want.

484
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,772
Hell, he'll tell you
the minor league baseball scores.

485
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,647
-You read me?
-Yes, sergeant.

486
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:41,485
He'll tell you how his mother wipes
her ass if you give him this juice.

487
00:30:41,695 --> 00:30:45,608
Not only that, you'll be able
to find him real easy next time.

488
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:48,409
Because he'll light up
the fucking night.

489
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:58,693
No one said you could leave.

490
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,252
-Why?
-Why what?

491
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:03,810
Why would I do that
to another human being?

492
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,889
JOHNSON:
Brother's right.

493
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:12,212
What the fuck's wrong with you?
That's one of your men.

494
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:14,088
Get him back here, boy.

495
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:15,523
-Bozz!
-Go get him, boy.

496
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:17,214
Jesus, Bozz.

497
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:19,094

00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:39,973
You get a card table
and set it up at the door!

665
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:41,409
Why, sergeant?

666
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:45,290
So a guard can sit there, you
backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.

667
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:47,963
You're fired as platoon guide,
dumb-ass dipshit!

668
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:52,568
-You think that's funny?!
-No!

669
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:53,571
Goddamn it!

670
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:57,171
Goddamn it! Give me 1 0, you
think it's fucking funny!

671
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:01,965
-Wilson!
-Yes, sergeant.

672
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,967
Get a card table.

673
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,284
You're on guard.

674
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:10,654
Guard, sergeant?

675
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:12,971
You heard me!
You want these 1 4s up your ass?

676
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:14,568
No, sergeant!

677
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:22,010
Bozz.

678
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:23,443
You're new platoon guide.

679
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,369
You put that piece of shit
under arrest.

680
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:31,164
You tell these men to get their
haircuts. Every swinging dick.

681
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,565
Congratulations, sweetheart.

682
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:36,487
Sorry about that, Jim.

683
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:37,844
Oh, man.

684
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:38,925
BOZZ:
Jealous?

685
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:40,811
Miter.

686
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,573
How you doing, man?

687
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:50,771
Okay, guys!

688
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:53,893
I ain't taking any of this
shit seriously.

689
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:57,366
Just do what you have to do
so we can live together.

690
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,083
If any of you are gonna run off
and hide, let me know.

691
00:43:00,295 --> 00:43:02,445
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.

692
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:06,011
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army. Hear me?

693
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:08,888
Sit the fuck down at your
dumb card table, punk.

694
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:11,333
JOHNSON:
Hey, fellas. Hey!

695
00:43:11,735 --> 00:43:15,091
Look, all I know is that no one's
talked to me like that. . .

696
00:43:15,335 --> 00:43:18,884
. . .since I got in this goddamned
green mean machine.

697
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:20,927
SOLDIER: Damn right.
SOLDIER: I attest to that.

698
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:24,366
So yeah, Bozz.
See what happens, baby.

699
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:27,846
What else they gonna do, send us
to Viet-fucking-Nam?

700
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:29,130
Too late for that.

701
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:34,569
SOLDIER:
Say, Bozz? Can I get a weekend pass?

702
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:37,369
Put your panties away,
your mama's panties.

703
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:41,565
BOZZ: They're your mama's panties.
You ain't been laid in three years.

704
00:43:42,295 --> 00:43:44,570
SOLDIER:
Get me off this base, I'll show you!

705
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:49,974
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.

706
00:43:50,615 --> 00:43:51,730
Take a deep breath.

707
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:55,368
Take this shit off.

708
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:01,373
You gotta relax.

709
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:52,690
-Shit, you gonna run again?
-Yeah.

710
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:55,455
I hear people in New Orleans
help me get to Mexico.

711
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:56,565
It ain't that easy.

712
00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:59,369
Army's got men, their whole job's
to look for you.

713
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:00,764
I don't care.

714
00:45:00,975 --> 00:45:03,967
They'll catch you, bring you here
and put you in prison.

715
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:08,093
You best move, don't make me
have to thump you.

716
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:10,934
Want to go to military prison?
You're not that crazy.

717
00:45:15,815 --> 00:45:17,043
Shut the fuck up!

718
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:21,371
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake
up Wilson. You don't want that.

719
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:36,772
Shit. What you gonna do now?

720
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:39,165
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.

721
00:45:39,415 --> 00:45:41,610
-Shit, man, that won't work.
-Watch!

722
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:42,964
I said, that won't work!

723
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:45,968
Bust my hand, they'll have to
let me out. Right?

724
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:48,484
-It ain't gonna work.
-Come on, Bozz!

725
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:51,772
Break my goddamn hand
so I can go home!

726
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:11,207
You know what I am, Bozz?
I'm a butcher.

727
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:12,734
Yeah, we all butchers.

728
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:14,687
No, I'm a real butcher.

729
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:18,570
-You haven't killed anyone yet.
-Goddamn it, I mean a real butcher!

730
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:21,613
Back home. I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.

731
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,528
Did it in high school,
did it after high school.

732
00:46:24,935 --> 00:46:27,688
I could cut you a piece of meat
so clean. . .

733
00:46:27,895 --> 00:46:30,363
. . .it'll have you praying
to beefsteak.

734
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:35,166
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.

735
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,164
You laughing at me?

736
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:45,612
No, Miter. I ain't laughing at you.

737
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:50,966
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.

738
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,767
I didn't make no money.

739
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:55,370
Just a store boy,
that's what my daddy said.

740
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:57,606
"Hey, store boy. Hey, boy! "

741
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:02,286
Called me boy. Imagine that? Shit
kicker, calling me boy all the time.

742
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:04,372
I ain't a boy, goddamn it!

743
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:07,170
Telling me how he's
a big fancy war hero!

744
00:47:07,415 --> 00:47:09,371
And my wife, that little--

745
00:47:12,815 --> 00:47:14,373
My wife.

746
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,688
She's pretty.

747
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:25,685
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.

748
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,768
Prettiest girl
in the state of Louisiana.

749
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:41,167
She was mad at me because
I was working all the time.

750
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:43,173
Giving her the money. . .

751
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,014
. . .for junior college.

752
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:48,171
I knowed then, like. . .

753
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:50,771
. . .Iike I knowed later on. . .

754
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:55,371
. . .she was seeing a fucking
college boy on the side!

755
00:47:55,575 --> 00:47:57,247
Goddamn it! My daddy said it.

756
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:01,283
He said, "See? See what a dumb-ass
bastard you are?

757
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,844
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.

758
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,053
You ought to have a little ring
in your nose. "

759
00:48:07,255 --> 00:48:11,214
So you thought you'd join the Army
and kill yourself like a real man.

760
00:48:12,815 --> 00:48:15,807
Bozz, I know you can get people out.

761
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:17,768
Maybe.

762
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:21,565
Even in this wild-ass nonsense,
some rules fly by.

763
00:48:22,495 --> 00:48:26,568
Please, Bozz. Please get me
out of here. Please?

764
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,370
Well, look here.

765
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:48,803
Goddamn.

766
00:48:50,215 --> 00:48:53,048
That captain sure didn't want
to let me go at first.

767
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:54,614
But I did like you said.

768
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:57,375
Told him the Army wants me
to see a psychiatrist.

769
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:01,164
-And that was it, huh?
-I wanted to thank you personally.

770
00:49:01,415 --> 00:49:02,643
Doctor sent me on leave.

771
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:06,046
He'll contact the Red Cross,
get me out-processed. . .

772
00:49:06,255 --> 00:49:07,813
. . .so I don't have to come back.

773
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:10,928
Good, Miter. Glad to hear
you're nuts, man.

774
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:16,013
-Best of luck, Miter.
-Thanks, Paxton.

775
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:19,372
-Miter.
-Take care, Johnson.

776
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:23,891
Thanks again, Bozz.

777
00:49:28,295 --> 00:49:30,126
-So long.
BOZZ: Go be a butcher, Miter!

778
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:33,964
-Try not to get shot, hear?
-Don't let your meat loaf, man.

779
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:42,251
(PAXTON CHUCKLES)

780
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:44,127
Yeah, fuck you.

781
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:56,166
-Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
-At ease.

782
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:59,173
So you're the new platoon
guide for 2nd Platoon?

783
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:00,251
Yes, sir.

784
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,094
The fucking world is full
of fucking surprises.

785
00:50:03,455 --> 00:50:06,128
It wasn't your plan to wear
sergeant's stripes. . .

786
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:08,485
. . .a week away from
Tigerland in a war.

787
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:11,971
I don't know, sir. The idea
crossed my mind now and again.

788
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,167
I just didn't think it would
all be so pitiful sad.

789
00:50:20,575 --> 00:50:22,486
Been looking over your 201 .

790
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:24,572
You're a Texas boy.

791
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:28,411
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.

792
00:50:28,615 --> 00:50:30,173
Dropout, worked construction.

793
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,093
-Get drafted?
-Yes, sir.

794
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:37,090
-Why didn't you stay in school?
-Maybe I needed some trouble, sir.

795
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:38,768
Well, you got it.

796
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:43,249
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.

797
00:50:43,895 --> 00:50:47,365
The company's like the bad end of a
shit storm. Your platoon's the worst.

798
00:50:47,575 --> 00:50:50,965
-Thank you, sir.
-That's not a compliment, smart-ass.

799
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:55,444
I don't want any more calls
from battalion. . .

800
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:57,964
. . .asking me why this troopie needs
a hardship discharge. . .

801
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:00,968
. . .and that troopie needs
some kind of a mental wet nurse.

802
00:51:01,215 --> 00:51:03,126
-You understand me?
-Yes, sir.

803
00:51:03,335 --> 00:51:05,974
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.

804
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:11,604
A week from now you'll ship out
to Tigerland.

805
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:14,648
That'll crawl in your skull
and look out your eyes.

806
00:51:14,895 --> 00:51:16,692
So let's start fresh.

807
00:51:16,895 --> 00:51:19,693
-Give your people a weekend pass.
-Already done it, sir.

808
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,773
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.

809
00:51:28,975 --> 00:51:32,126
I believe you could soldier as well
as any man in this army.

810
00:51:32,335 --> 00:51:35,008
I even think you want to,
but you won't.

811
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:38,170
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.

812
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:43,930
We're fighting a war, private. Nobody
knows how he's gonna come back.

813
00:51:45,215 --> 00:51:47,934
That's not the kind of alive
I'm talking about, sir.

814
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:49,768
BOZZ:
Here's 1 50 bucks.

815
00:51:49,975 --> 00:51:51,886
(GIRL SPEAKS)

816
00:52:03,575 --> 00:52:05,566
Happy Halloween!

817
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:09,243
Cough it up, Brian.

818
00:52:09,895 --> 00:52:10,611
Next time, Pax.

819
00:52:10,815 --> 00:52:12,567
-Catch you later, buddy.
-All right.

820
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:23,365
Who's that girl you're
talking to, Bozz?

821
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,809
-Trying to score some weed.
-Know what I don't get?

822
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:31,052
Why they haven't tossed you
out on some lunatic discharge. . .

823
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:33,485
-. . .some bullshit like that.
-I ain't crazy.

824
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:35,612
You're out of your fucking mind.

825
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:39,569
My reasons are my reasons and
no one has to like them.

826
00:52:39,775 --> 00:52:42,573
What about these fucking war games?
What if it's a lie?

827
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:45,773
What if the guys who tell you and me
shit to do were lied to also?

828
00:52:46,415 --> 00:52:49,851
Maybe since everyone believes

01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:21,410
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.

996
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:24,766
I don't want you drummed out
on some bad conduct discharge.

997
01:04:26,015 --> 01:04:29,371
I want you exactly where you are.

998
01:04:30,015 --> 01:04:33,166
And we'll just naturally chew you up.

999
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:40,451
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.

1000
01:05:08,455 --> 01:05:10,525
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.

1001
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:12,766
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

1002
01:05:13,015 --> 01:05:15,609
-Shut your fucking mouth.
-You shut the fuck up.

1003
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:17,732
-Guys, relax.
-I ain't starting.

1004
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:20,091
You already got your ass beat once.

1005
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:24,049
-Just watch your back in Tigerland.
-I'll do that.

1006
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:28,486
I guess I'm supposed to joke
about how I owe you my life.

1007
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:31,573
-He almost killed you.
-You jealous?

1008
01:05:31,815 --> 01:05:33,885
You wanted to know what it was like.

1009
01:05:34,095 --> 01:05:35,323
What what was like?

1010
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:38,135
The great lesson
of being close to death.

1011
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,728
Know what I know?

1012
01:05:39,975 --> 01:05:41,886
Same thing you know.

1013
01:05:42,255 --> 01:05:43,893
We're in a real bad way.

1014
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:06,693
Fuck.

1015
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,933
Real bad way.

1016
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:12,405
All right! Let's go! Move it!

1017
01:06:12,655 --> 01:06:13,883
Come on! Let's go!

1018
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:16,365
-Come on! Move! Move!
SERGEANT: Move your ass!

1019
01:06:16,615 --> 01:06:18,492
Come on, fat boy! Move your ass!

1020
01:06:18,735 --> 01:06:20,487
Let's go, soldier!

1021
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:27,493
SERGEANT:
Let's go! Let's go!

1022
01:06:31,735 --> 01:06:33,009
C.O. :
Welcome to Tigerland!

1023
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:36,133
Your final training
before you're shipped overseas!

1024
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:39,287
Here, everything's done
exactly as it is over there.

1025
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,963
You will search and destroy,
hunt and kill!

1026
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:45,366
You'll move by chopper to secure
any area deemed necessary.

1027
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,526
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.

1028
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:50,289
Minor mistakes
will pay back major punishment.

1029
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,804
Maybe you've heard
we've lost this war.

1030
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,933
Or we've lost the support
of people here at home.

1031
01:06:56,175 --> 01:06:58,131
It's too late to
ask those questions.

1032
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,173
You're not back on the block.

1033
01:07:00,415 --> 01:07:02,929
You're alive in a year,
we'll talk about it.

1034
01:07:03,175 --> 01:07:04,608
When you arrive in Nam. . .

1035
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:07,767
. . .it's important to get acclimated
as quickly as you can.

1036
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:09,971
Remember to think.

1037
01:07:10,175 --> 01:07:12,211
-You understand me?
-Yes, sergeant!

1038
01:07:12,455 --> 01:07:17,290
What matters now is sharpening your
ability to find and destroy the enemy.

1039
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:19,207
Practice how to stay alive.

1040
01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:22,731
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.

1041
01:07:23,295 --> 01:07:25,729
You're thinking you'll
go somewhere safe.

1042
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,124
You'll luck out.

1043
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:30,492
Tigerland is where
you stop bullshitting yourself.

1044
01:07:30,735 --> 01:07:34,410
SOLDIER: Sarge, you got any advice
on how to stay alive in Vietnam?

1045
01:07:34,655 --> 01:07:37,294
SERGEANT: I do, private. Don't go.
-Right on, right on.

1046
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:39,890
BOZZ:
My friend here wants the experience.

1047
01:07:40,135 --> 01:07:41,887
Says he ain't scared.

1048
01:07:42,175 --> 01:07:43,893
Well, good luck.

1049
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:47,610
If you ask me, I'll stick
with the smart and the scared.

1050
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:52,610
You'll be under the care of NCOs
and officers who were in combat.

1051
01:07:52,855 --> 01:07:54,368
Listen to them.

1052
01:07:54,615 --> 01:07:57,687
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.

1053
01:07:58,895 --> 01:08:00,613
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.

1054
01:08:00,855 --> 01:08:02,732
I've done two tours in Vietnam.

1055
01:08:02,975 --> 01:08:05,489
My first in '67 with the 1 01 st.

1056
01:08:05,935 --> 01:08:08,608
Ijust completed my second with MAC-V.

1057
01:08:08,855 --> 01:08:11,528
I only have two words
of advice for you.

1058
01:08:11,775 --> 01:08:13,447
And those are to listen...

1059
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:15,089
...and to learn.

1060
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,325
All right, let's saddle up.

1061
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,131
Let's go! Let's saddle up!

1062
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,888
Let's go, goddamn it!

1063
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:28,287
COTA:
Get down!

1064
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,884
Good job, Paxton. Good job.

1065
01:08:31,135 --> 01:08:32,693
Good job, Johnson.

1066
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,884
All right.

1067
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:35,966
Get your ass behind that tree!

1068
01:08:36,175 --> 01:08:39,884
Fantastic. You guys move
like fucking soldiers!

1069
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:42,286
Get your ass down!

1070
01:08:43,335 --> 01:08:44,893
Ryan, get your ass down!

1071
01:08:45,135 --> 01:08:47,205
Go! Move! Move!

1072
01:08:47,455 --> 01:08:49,889
Bozz, keep that barrel
out of the dirt!

1073
01:08:50,095 --> 01:08:51,289
Move, move, move!

1074
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:53,690
Paxton, why are you slowing up?

1075
01:08:53,895 --> 01:08:55,294
Get your ass down!

1076
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:57,772
You are the weak link!

1077
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,410
This is not the time to slow up.

1078
01:09:00,655 --> 01:09:02,407
Adapt! Overcome!

1079
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:04,247
Move! Get in there!

1080
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,564
You good?

1081
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:08,533
Why were you slow, Paxton?

1082
01:09:08,775 --> 01:09:11,494
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine, sergeant.

1083
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:23,893
Diagonal, Private Barnes.

1084
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:26,968
-So you don't chop your knee off.
-Yes, sergeant.

1085
01:09:32,295 --> 01:09:35,093
Go ahead, Paxton.
I gotta take a piss.

1086
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:37,887
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1087
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:36,687
BOZZ: "Jim Paxton
on personal guide to pain. "

1088
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:42,769
Get that fucking torch out of my face
and put that cigarette out.

1089
01:10:42,975 --> 01:10:45,967
You might as well
hang a big neon sign that says:

1090
01:10:46,215 --> 01:10:48,285
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here. "

1091
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:51,293
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.

1092
01:10:51,535 --> 01:10:53,491
-Do you understand?
PAXTON: Yes.

1093
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,493
-Good.
BOZZ: I'm still alive, sergeant.

1094
01:10:56,855 --> 01:10:59,892
-What did you say?
-I said, I'm still alive.

1095
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:03,287
I miraculously survived the attack.

1096
01:11:03,655 --> 01:11:05,486
-You didn't get hit?
-No.

1097
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,014
Are your friends alive?

1098
01:11:07,255 --> 01:11:10,088
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.

1099
01:11:10,415 --> 01:11:13,725
If you're gonna make up a story,
make up a happy one.

1100
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:16,685
I ain't making anything up, son.

1101
01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:23,005
And in Vietnam there are no
happy fucking stories.

1102
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,333
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan. . .

1103
01:11:32,575 --> 01:11:35,487
. . .that I went to AIT with.

1104
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:41,084
In '67, when the call came,
we got sent off to Nam.

1105
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:46,092
We had only been in country
a few days. We was green as grass.

1106
01:11:47,335 --> 01:11:51,294
We were in a two-man listening post,
talking just like we are here.

1107
01:11:51,935 --> 01:11:54,085
Kelly lit up a cigarette.

1108
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:57,529
One minute we're naming
his unborn child. . .

1109
01:11:57,775 --> 01:12:01,245
. . .and the next second
his brains were in my lap.

1110
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:16,325
The sniper zeroed in
on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.

1111
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:24,290
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.

1112
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:28,890
Respect for your superiors
and what they're trying to teach you.

1113
01:12:30,135 --> 01:12:33,286
Respect for yourselves and your unit.

1114
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,891
And most important. . .

1115
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:40,087
. . .respect the enemy.

1116
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,685
You have 42 minutes. . .

1117
01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:50,495
. . .then the squad's on patrol.

1118
01:12:55,495 --> 01:12:56,689
Fuck.

1119
01:13:03,495 --> 01:13:07,693
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese
village we could create for you. . .

1120
01:13:07,935 --> 01:13:09,129
. . .here on the base!

1121
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,209
Now, listen. You're all gooks,
so nobody speaks English.

1122
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,004
Anybody asks you a question
in English, you answer, "No bic. "

1123
01:13:17,255 --> 01:13:19,689
It means, "I don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.

1124
01:13:19,935 --> 01:13:20,845
No bic.

1125
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:24,525
Good. Private Bozz, you are
the only man that speaks English.

1126
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:29,610
Speak only to the man who identifies
himself as interpreter. Understood?

1127
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:31,533
-Yes, sir.
-Good. Private Paxton.

1128
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:33,208
You are the Vietcong.

1129
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:37,892
They come through, their objective
is to find the VC sympathizer.

1130
01:13:38,095 --> 01:13:40,529
In other words, you, Private Paxton.

1131
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:42,686
They have five minutes.

1132
01:13:42,895 --> 01:13:45,887
You tell them nothing.

1133
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:47,933
I warn you, they're beat up.

1134
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:50,006
They've been awake three nights.

1135
01:13:50,255 --> 01:13:51,734
Forced marched all day.

1136
01:13:51,975 --> 01:13:55,934
They fuck this up,
they'll march another six miles.

1137
01:13:56,135 --> 01:13:57,329
One other thing:

1138
01:13:57,575 --> 01:14:01,284
They find out
which one of you is VC...

1139
01:14:01,535 --> 01:14:04,095
...and you'll be the ones
out in the boonies...

1140
01:14:04,295 --> 01:14:07,571
...on no sleep, forced marching
for the next two nights.

1141
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:08,764
Understood?

1142
01:14:09,015 --> 01:14:10,926
-Yes, sergeant.
-Let's get to work.

1143
01:14:11,175 --> 01:14:13,735
Private Bozz, Paxton. Over here.

1144
01:14:13,975 --> 01:14:17,331
Lets see. . . .
Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.

1145
01:14:17,575 --> 01:14:19,691
Make it as realistic as possible.

1146
01:14:19,895 --> 01:14:22,090
This is not a fucking joke.

1147
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,730
I like this.
It's like a war theme park.

1148
01:14:24,975 --> 01:14:27,535
I'm so tired. I'm gonna pass out.

1149
01:14:37,815 --> 01:14:40,090
Hey, here they come.

1150
01:14:45,335 --> 01:14:46,688
Shit.

1151
01:14:46,935 --> 01:14:48,129
It's Wilson.

1152
01:14:49,255 --> 01:14:50,483
What?

1153
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:54,165
-I thought we got him out.
-There's a war going on.

1154
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,684
Plenty of room
for psychopathic killers.

1155
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,363
Let's move it.
We don't got much time.

1156
01:14:59,615 --> 01:15:01,890
We gotta find the VC.

1157
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:06,403
No bic.

1158
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:08,687
Fuck me.

1159
01:15:10,575 --> 01:15:11,803
-VC?
-No bic.

1160
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,491
-Get your ass on the ground!
-No bic.

1161
01:15:15,695 --> 01:15:17,765
-No bic.
-No bic. No bic.

1162
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:21,492
Get on the fucking ground!

1163
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:23,488
-You VC?
-No bic.

1164
01:15:24,535 --> 01:15:25,888
-You VC?
-No bic.

1165
01:15:26,095 --> 01:15:27,050
-You VC?
-No bic.

1166

HICKS:
How'd that feel?

1167
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:32,887
Need an interpreter?
I'm the only one that speaks English.

1168
01:15:35,775 --> 01:15:37,447
HICKS:
How does that feel, Paxton?

1169
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:45,691
HICKS:
What are you gonna write about now?

1170
01:15:50,055 --> 01:15:52,171
What are you writing in your journal?

1171
01:15:58,015 --> 01:15:59,334
Don't fucking move!

1172
01:16:01,175 --> 01:16:03,484
Let go of him, goddamn it!

1173
01:16:09,975 --> 01:16:13,285
-You're in charge! On your feet!
-Yes, sergeant.

1174
01:16:13,775 --> 01:16:16,005
COTA:
Where is your weapon, soldier?

1175
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,483
There it is.

1176
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:20,886
Why didn't you secure the area,
Private Wilson?

1177
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,811
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control!

1178
01:16:25,055 --> 01:16:26,488
Yes, sergeant.

1179
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:29,725
Did you find any VC?

1180
01:16:29,975 --> 01:16:33,684
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.

1181
01:16:34,055 --> 01:16:35,283
Come here.

1182
01:16:37,215 --> 01:16:41,333
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.

1183
01:16:41,535 --> 01:16:43,685
Get out of here! Let's go. Move!

1184
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:46,011
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Is that right?

1185
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,130
-You gonna kill me again?
-I'll kill you.

1186
01:16:49,455 --> 01:16:51,207
Get your hands off him!

1187
01:16:52,655 --> 01:16:54,213
You want to go?

1188
01:16:54,455 --> 01:16:56,923
Get the fuck out of here!

1189
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:03,085
-Get the fuck out!
-I'll break your neck!

1190
01:17:03,455 --> 01:17:05,764
-Let's move!
WILSON: Get the fuck out of here!

1191
01:17:06,015 --> 01:17:07,607
Somebody grab my steel pot.

1192
01:17:07,855 --> 01:17:09,493
COTA:
Get out of here.

1193
01:17:09,815 --> 01:17:11,726
-How you doing?
-Shit.

1194
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,328
Is he all right?

1195
01:17:13,575 --> 01:17:14,894
BOZZ:
No, he's not all right.

1196
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,285
COTA:
Take your time.

1197
01:17:19,175 --> 01:17:20,574
(PAXTON COUGHS)

1198
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:22,206
-You going?
BOZZ: I can't take you with me.

1199
01:18:22,455 --> 01:18:24,810
Not me. Paxton. He's hurting.

1200
01:18:25,055 --> 01:18:26,090
He signed up.

1201
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,893
And you judged him for it.

1202
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:31,053
You even made me feel guilty
and I was drafted.

1203
01:18:34,895 --> 01:18:37,489
You saw what Wilson did to him today.

1204
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,694
He's broken down.

1205
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,568
And the Army didn't do
all the breaking. Take him.

1206
01:18:43,815 --> 01:18:46,773
It's not my fault if he
just realized what he did.

1207
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:49,290
I only got time for my sad story.

1208
01:18:49,535 --> 01:18:51,890
-Take him with you.
-Fuck off!

1209
01:18:52,135 --> 01:18:54,695
Wilson's gonna take
his hate out on somebody.

1210
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:59,486
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.

1211
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,771
Johnson, I like you, but fuck off.

1212
01:19:02,895 --> 01:19:05,284
Yeah, well,
I ain't standing in your way.

1213
01:19:58,655 --> 01:20:00,452
Rise and shine, gentlemen!

1214
01:20:00,655 --> 01:20:02,532
Let's go, gentlemen! Roll 'em!

1215
01:20:02,775 --> 01:20:05,494
Let's go! Move! Get on your feet!

1216
01:20:05,695 --> 01:20:10,086
I know you're tired, but you'll be
doing a lot of this in the next year!

1217
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:11,688
If you're not. . .

1218
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:14,648
-. . .then you're in a body bag.
-Where's Bozz?

1219
01:20:14,855 --> 01:20:17,494
Waiting for a dust-off.

1220
01:20:18,055 --> 01:20:20,489
Where is your squad leader?

1221
01:20:20,895 --> 01:20:22,533
Is this his weapon?

1222
01:20:22,775 --> 01:20:25,494
Does anybody know
where your squad leader is?

1223
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:27,088
Where is he, Johnson?

1224
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,651
-Where is your weapon, Private Bozz?
-Right here, sarge.

1225
01:20:36,855 --> 01:20:38,049
I know that.

1226
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:41,805
The next time you decide
to take a piss or a fucking shit. . .

1227
01:20:42,055 --> 01:20:44,091
. . .you make sure you have your weapon.

1228
01:20:44,295 --> 01:20:47,492
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it?

1229
01:20:47,695 --> 01:20:51,131
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think I'd need it.

1230
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,728
Very funny.

1231
01:20:53,535 --> 01:20:55,127
You take point.

1232
01:20:55,655 --> 01:20:59,489
Paxton, take slack. Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.

1233
01:20:59,695 --> 01:21:00,889
Listen up.

1234
01:21:01,135 --> 01:21:04,491
You'll square off
against the boys from yesterday.

1235
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,373
They may have booby traps.

1236
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:09,005
They may have forward observers
watching.

1237
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:12,327
They may do all manner of shit
that you don't know.

1238
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:17,285
That's why you will keep
your eyes open and your mouths shut.

1239
01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:20,692
-Is that fucking understood?
-Yes, sarge.

1240
01:21:22,615 --> 01:21:23,730
Let's move out.

1241
01:21:26,335 --> 01:21:29,884
-Welcome back.
-You owe me 1 50 bucks.

Hurry up, Paxton. Let's go.

01:22:06,775 --> 01:22:08,174
Dixie, my 1 2.

1245
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,484
Move it! Come on!

1246
01:23:42,455 --> 01:23:43,774
You okay?

1247
01:24:45,655 --> 01:24:49,728
Fuck, Bozz. Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked?

1248
01:24:49,975 --> 01:24:52,364
Relax. You'll be fine.

1249
01:24:52,615 --> 01:24:54,287
You'll be fine.

Psst, psst, psst.

1251
01:25:29,335 --> 01:25:32,691
Wilson, what the hell are you doing?
That's live ammo.

1252
01:26:26,855 --> 01:26:28,686
Ambush! 1 2:00!

1253
01:26:35,095 --> 01:26:36,289
Live ammo!

1254
01:26:39,175 --> 01:26:41,643

Look at me.

1261
01:27:15,015 --> 01:27:17,165
You will place your weapon on safe!

1262
01:27:17,575 --> 01:27:20,692
You will raise your weapon
above your fucking head. . .

your fucking brains out!

Do it!

On your fucking knees, now!

01:27:33,055 --> 01:27:34,568
Get on your fucking knees!

-An accident. My fault.

I miss my woman and kid

1275
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,286
I think about all the things

1276
01:28:16,535 --> 01:28:18,207
From way back when

01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:20,090
SOLDIER:
Sing it, boy.

1278
01:28:20,975 --> 01:28:23,887
I miss my grandma 's apple pie

1279
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:27,724
Shit, I miss getting high

1280
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:31,934
And my Uncle Sam is sending me to die

You know what now?

1282
01:28:34,055 --> 01:28:37,172
He got me looking for Charlie

1283
01:28:37,415 --> 01:28:40,487
And I don 't know who he is

1284
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:50,811
I used to have a Cadillac

1285

I left it back home

Still can hear her moan

1288
01:29:00,495 --> 01:29:03,328
Is so much misery

1289
01:29:03,575 --> 01:29:06,692
Up here in Charlie Company

1290
01:29:07,255 --> 01:29:10,531
I wonder if I die
Will they still remember me?

Let's go, move it!
This war is not gonna last forever!

Hey! Bozz.

-I did, but you wouldn't let me.

1296

How's your eye?

1297
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:35,013
Got an injury bad enough to get out,
no permanent damage. Imagine that.

1298
01:29:35,215 --> 01:29:36,967
More corny wisdom for your book.

"In the country of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king. "

Pretty fancy shooting, Tex.
Thank you.

1301
01:29:44,495 --> 01:29:47,612
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.

1302
01:29:48,095 --> 01:29:49,687
No, it wasn't.

1303
01:29:51,015 --> 01:29:53,051
Somebody had to take your place.

1304
01:29:53,255 --> 01:29:54,085
Bozz!

1305
01:29:54,295 --> 01:29:56,809
Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.

1306
01:29:58,175 --> 01:29:59,847
Write me when you get there.

1307

This is it, man.

1308
01:30:02,575 --> 01:30:04,566
No more phony Army buddy crap.

1309
01:30:12,095 --> 01:30:13,687
Go home.

1310
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:16,086
Live a long time.

1311
01:30:17,175 --> 01:30:19,291
Try not to be too much of an asshole.

1312
01:30:20,935 --> 01:30:23,495
I'm gonna write
a whole book about this.

1313
01:30:23,935 --> 01:30:25,527
Tell everyone about you.

. . .sorry for my misbehavior earlier.

1317
01:30:37,295 --> 01:30:38,489
Real sorry.

1318
01:30:48,535 --> 01:30:50,412
See you back here. Take care.

1319
01:30:50,615 --> 01:30:52,128
-Watch your back.
JOHNSON: See you.

1320
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:56,334
-I'll write a book about you, Bozz!
-No, you won't.

1321
01:30:56,575 --> 01:30:59,089
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.

Jesus! Bozz!

1323
01:31:02,295 --> 01:31:04,889
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book!

01:31:06,135 --> 01:31:07,887
What are you doing? Shit!

1325
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:10,285
Stop the bus!

1326
01:31:12,335 --> 01:31:15,133
Oh, Bozz, what is this shit?

1327
01:31:26,535 --> 01:31:28,491
PAXTON:
I never saw Bozz again.

1328
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:32,164
Some guys said he died in Nam...

1329
01:31:32,455 --> 01:31:34,286
...but he was never listed.

1330

Some said he just
disappeared over there.

1331
01:31:38,455 --> 01:31:41,527
One guy called and said
