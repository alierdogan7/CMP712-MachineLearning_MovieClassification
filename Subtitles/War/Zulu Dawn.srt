"from their own king, Cetshwayo."

13
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:48,428
You will see from the letter that this ultimatum is our decision alone.

14
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:53,429
Her Majesty's Government seems to prefer a negotiated settlement.

You moved.

23
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:36,866
Go and tell the NCO of that black shambles that you love him more than you love me.

24
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:38,067
Now!

25
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:47,309
You're not fit to be in the British Army, you different-coloured articles. Straighten up!

26
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:53,071
I'm to tell you, Corporal, that I love you more than my colour sergeant.

27
00:07:57,553 --> 00:08:02,074
That's frightening. Get out of my bloody sight!

28
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,755
Put your rifle over your head

and double round this field till you drop bloody dead!

Come on, here we go.

37
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,451
No, no! One at a time.

38
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,851
What do you want?

39
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:53,453
What do you need, eh?

40
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,612

We've come to fight the Zulu. We aren't at war yet. Bit young.

43
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:17,979
My nephew. He can shoot, track, speak Zulu and fight. He's got assegai marks to prove it.

44
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,301
Show him.

45
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,064
- You! - Sir!

46
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:30,825

SIKALI HORSE, FORWARD!

52
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,300
Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?

53
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:19,222
Sikali Horse, my lord. Christians all. I know each man by name.

54
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,663
Do they come well recommended? They rode for me at Bushman's Pass.

55
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,945
Oh, indeed.

56
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:32,347
Crealock, see that Col Durnford has an officer for his hard riders - the subaltern from the 24th.

57
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:37,308
It might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.

58
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:42,830
Yes. I see you issued each of them with a Martini-Henry carbine.

59
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:49,673
Our quota for natives - one rifle to ten men and five rounds per rifle. Will they make good use of them?

60
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:56,154
They're as good marksmen as horsemen.No doubting their horsemanship, Col Durnford.

61
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,716
Crealock.

62
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:05,557
We'll think how to make best use of Col Durnford's African knowledge.

63
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:20,764
Col Durnford. William Vereker.Yes? I hear you're seeking officers.

64
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:26,045
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot.

65
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,619
Private Williams!

66
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,420
You've stopped.

67
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,263

Mr Raw!

69
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:22,385
Take Mr Vereker to the store and see he's issued the necessary equipment.

70
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:29,627
And then show him to the mess and explain to him how an officer's expected to behave.

71
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,153
Our good Col Durnford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.

72
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:51,473
It's rumoured Lord Chelmsford's to make Durnford second-in-command. Typical of Her Majesty's Army!

73
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:58,197
Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.Now, now, Mr Melvill. Less of your spleen.

74
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,881
Stranger in the mess! Gentlemen, my lord.

75
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:16,363
Announce yourself.

76
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:20,285
Good day, Frederick.

77
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:23,287
Good day, William.

78
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:28,086
Pleased you could join us.It was that or join the Zulu.Join the Zulu?

79
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,929
Oh, yes, you're in the thick of it.

80
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:35,249
Your father said you were farming near Zululand.

81
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,452
Sent his regards, should I meet up with you.

82
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:44,253
That's nice of the old boy. You'd better call out who you are.

83
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,216
William Vereker.

84
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:56,417
Sgt Murphy, bring drinks for the stranger.

85
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:59,097
Allow me to introduce the mess.

86
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,978
Col Pulleine.

87
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,940
Messrs Melvill,

88
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,740
Coghill,

89
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,379
Jackson,

90
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,982
Milne, Major Russell, Stevenson... How do you do?

91
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:15,705
Harford and Harford's best friend.

92
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:21,745
Don't leave your gin around, or Harford will have it full of preserved butterflies.

93
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,827
Damn waste, if you ask me.

94
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:28,790
There's a shortage of that where I've been.

95
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,831
They fight with spears, don't they? Is that fair against a Martini-Henry?

96
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,192
Did you really choose between Britain and the Zulu?

97
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:41,312
A damn close thing it was, too. Ah, well done, Murphy.

98
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:49,275
Stranger's cup. Down it in one and we share your mess bill for a week.

99
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:54,757
And if I don't? You buy a bottle of good claret for each mess member.

100
00:15:54,798 --> 00:16:01,639
If it's too much, we'll forward the bill to your father in the House of Lords. No offence meant, Vereker.

101
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,280
No offence taken, Melvill.

102
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:10,564
To men who aren't afraid to speak their minds.

103
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:15,965
< Good luck, sir.

104
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,451
Down, down, down!

105
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,650
Down, down, down, down!

106
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:47,295
Not quite.

107
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:55,859
The bottles of claret are on me, gentlemen.

108
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,860
The regiment!

109
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,420
ALL: The regiment!

110
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:04,940
The regiment.

111
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:07,700
ZULUS CHEER AND SHOUT

112
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,926
Very good!

113
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,687
Thank you!

114
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:18,649
Anthony. Anthony!

115
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,891
Hold this.

116
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:32,094
Well batted! Well batted!

117
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:43,098
HE SPEAKS BANTU

118
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,659
Joseph! How are the Colenso girls?

119
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:53,861
They're all in the garden, sir. They'll be glad to see you, I'm sure.

120
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,026
Ready? Right!

121
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:14,269
Oh, you beast!

122
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,788
Somebody! Ah, that fooled you!

123
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:40,237
Tipped it! Out! I did not!

124
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:42,357
William!

125
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,279
You cheat! You!

126
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:48,720
Me cheat?! Same old Fanny!

127
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:55,763
Welcome! Welcome back!

128
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:07,287
Excuse me, ladies.

129
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:12,049
Did you get your farm going?

130
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,289
Yes, I did.

131
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,530
How was it?

132
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,011
I've never been so happy.

133
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:23,012
Sorry you had to leave.

134
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:31,615
You've met the Hon William Vereker, I believe.

135
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,335
Yes. We were childhood friends.

136
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:38,857
Your childhood friend shot a dead cow at the gallop yesterday.

137
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:41,218
Most impressive!

138
00:22:57,783 --> 00:23:00,504
There is a Mrs Durnford, is there?

139
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:07,547
She exists but nothing's been heard of her the eight years Durnford's been in Africa.

140
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,909
Although much is spoken of her now, my lord.

141
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:16,631
I recommended him to you because he knows Africa so well.

142
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:21,993
Indeed. His ability to recruit native contingents is proving invaluable.

143
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,554
How do you rate him as a soldier?

144
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:29,274
It is widely held he has courage and he's an excellent engineer.

145
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:31,755
Shall we join the guests?

146
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,842
Do you think she might become interested in...someone?

147
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:58,446
Which one? The one who keeps looking at me.

148
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:02,726
Could be you flatter yourself - it's her odd eye.

149
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:05,807
They must've locked the good ones up!

150
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,049
Ah! General!

151
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,969
Do you find our border country congenial, my lord?

152
00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:17,932
Landscape - congenial, ma'am. As a border - vulnerable.

153
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:21,813
Do you really think Cetshwayo will attack us?

154
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:26,654
The intention of the Zulu Impi and their king concern me deeply.

155
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:32,616
He has no intention of attacking Natal - unless he's given no option.

156
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:35,218
He has no quarrel with us.

157
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:40,500
How rare to meet a young lady interested in tactical matters!

158
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,580
Is it not most rare?

159
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,620
You are talking of a violent and murdering barbarian

160
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:50,542
with an army of 30,000 warriors just across the river.

161
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:54,825
My father has lived with the Zulus for many years.

162
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:58,906
Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 people to become king!

163
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:01,947
The English Tudor kings did no less -

164
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:06,989
much later in our nation's history, I might add.

165
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:09,790
And the French, much more recently.

166
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,672
That may well be, your grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear...

167
00:25:15,752 --> 00:25:19,112
..the defence of all this - Natal.

168
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,993
Yes.

169
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:26,355
Well, it's difficult to stand against that position -

170
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:29,317
IF you speak only of defence.

171
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:34,637
And what does our good Col Durnford think? >

172
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:38,680
If the people of Natal wish to feel safe,

173
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,721
let them persuade their husbands and sons to volunteer. We need officers and men.

174
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:46,003
We do, Colonel. Good point.

175
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:52,524
I cannot be brought to believe that Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.

176
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:55,445
Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior.

177
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:58,807
Without war, there's no Zulu nation.

178
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:01,848
Nobody is really safe, are they?

179
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:06,889
Mrs DeWitt has four daughters, Henry, and I fear she feels for them all. >

180
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,852
Your daughters may indeed be in some danger, Mrs DeWitt - but not from the Zulus.

181
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:52,025
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH

182
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:56,826
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!

183
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,188
I think I should inform you

184
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:07,669
that I am obliged to issue a notification

185
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,832
declaring a state of war between Her Majesty's Government

186
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:16,233
and the Zulu king, Cetshwayo,

187
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:21,595
on his non-compliance with the ultimatum made on him,

188
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:25,557
urging reparation and redress

189
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:29,957
for violations of British sovereignty.

190
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,318
SCATTERED APPLAUSE

191
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,561
Why?

192
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:41,602
Why do men think of nothing but killing?

193
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:24,056
This is a wonderful land

194
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,617
we're privileged to share.

195
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,020
Dear God...

196
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,459
..there should be room for all of us!

197
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:45,823
There goes No 2 Company.

198
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:48,665
Quartermaster. Quartermaster.

199
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:01,149
I'll see ya!

200
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,949
No-no!

201
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,874
Do I believe what me eyes see?

202
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:18,635
The whole bleedin' army moving off to meet the murdering heathen

203
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,516
and what goes on in here? A game of brag! BRAG!

204
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:24,998
Sorry, Quartermaster.

205
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:31,160
You'll be more sorry when the Zulu ask, "What can you offer me not to slit your gut?"

206
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,641
And you'll say, "The knave of hearts, sir! The knave of hearts!"

207
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:39,083
THEY CHUCKLE Move!

208
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:45,964
For the savage, as for the child,

209
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:49,407
chastisement is sometimes a kindness.

210
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:53,087
Let us hope, General,

211
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:58,248
that this will be the final solution to the Zulu problem.

212
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,858
Come on, boys! Get up!

213
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:25,498
Quick! Calm down!

214
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,700
And again! Come back here, you thief!

215
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,221
About ready, sir.

216
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,861
My lord, I've prepared a list of ideas for you to see.

217
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,303
Excellent! Give them to Crealock.

218
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:44,906
My lord, this list was prepared for you. I don't think another can understand its true value.

219
00:30:44,946 --> 00:30:47,626
Thank you, Col Durnford.

220
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:57,030
Gentlemen, within ten days we shall cross the Buffalo River

221
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,471
and British soldiers will then be in Zululand.

222
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,751
Col Durnford will remain down-river

223
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,793
and defend the Natal border.

224
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:20,997
Will you hear Last Post, sir?

225
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,439
I listened to your Stand To this morning. It was perfect.

226
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:30,480
Couldn't have done it better myself - even when I was bugler to Wellington.

227
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,522
Where did you get that black eye? The cooks saw me dip your shaving tin

228
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:39,885
in their tea water. Made their tea taste of soap, they said.

229
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:42,725
So you got it in the line of duty.

230
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:45,366
Point taken.

231
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,929
Will we be fighting the Zulu soon?

232
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:53,369
Could be.

233
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:56,330
ATTAS!

234
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,051
When we cross the river into Zululand

235
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:02,732
they might be waiting there for us to show up -

236
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:06,453
them stabbing assegias pointing right at our bellies!

237
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:09,014
Are you afeard of the Zulu?

238
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:13,456
One Zulu is only one man, and I'm afeard of no one man!

239
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,857
But the Zulu, they come in thousands,

240
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:20,699
like a black wave of death, in their thousands.

241
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,939
Them assegias, stabbing!

242
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:39,385
Your orders, Mr Vereker?

243
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:43,746
I am to take the Sikali with the main column to the river.

244
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:48,188
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.

245
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:51,629
Chelmsford wants a good man on the border -

246
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:55,790
he fears a flanking attack and wants you in reserve.

247
00:32:55,831 --> 00:33:00,072
The wrong side of the river, the wrong place?!

248
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:05,595
Does he wish me to fight the Zulu or merely observe their habitat?

249
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:11,596
Sir.

250
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,923
God go with you, Mr Vereker.

251
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:06,015
SOLDIERS: Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray!

252
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:33,864
GET UP NOW! GET ON!

253
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,110
Get off his arse, you bloody idiot!

254
00:36:58,113 --> 00:37:00,874
KEEP 'EM IN LINE!

255
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:03,596
Sarge! Sarge! I'm drowning, Sarge!

256
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:07,478
What the hell do you mean by having the same name as me?!

257
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,077
Sorry, Sarge!

258
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:54,293
Do you think Cetshwayo will send a party to greet you?

259
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:59,334
They're here. We just have to ensure they don't get back to announce us.

260
00:37:59,374 --> 00:38:01,776
You mean you've seen them?

261
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,100
Forward, Sikali!

262
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,663
Come on! Come on!

263
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:42,991
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?

264
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:48,591
Nogg, sir. Actual name is Norris Newman. He's from The Standard.

265
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:53,075
Our runners bear his dispatches, do they not?Of course!

266
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,676
Come on, lads! It's only a river!

267
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:04,558
Come on! Make it today!

268
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,281
Come on, you lot! Get these bastards across!

269
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:17,322
It's only water! You'll only get wet! Come along, you idle scum!

270
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:33,687
Break that ammunition crate and I'll have your guts for garters!

271
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:51,614
An historic moment, don't you think?

272
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:56,056
Norris Newman of The Standard. I saw you lead our cavalry.

273
00:39:56,096 --> 00:40:01,137
Indeed. I was one of the first across.Were they in good heart?

274
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:07,179
They spurred onto the high ground, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu.

275
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,740
Full of sport, they were, my lord.

276
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:16,543
Tell what you see, write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right.

277
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,703
If I've got it right, my lord,

278
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:22,424
you lead an invasion into Zululand -

279
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,865
I see it all around me -

280
00:40:24,904 --> 00:40:29,827
but "Why?" is the question my readers will ask. "Why?"

281
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:32,108
Do not confuse yourself.

282
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:37,228
Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.

283
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,871
So attack is your defence.

284
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:47,431
Well, let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis for destruction.

285
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:51,913
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid engagement.

286
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:32,529
I have it, my lord, we attack for sport. Or is it reputations?

287
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:35,290
Enough of your politicking, Noggs.

288
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:41,930
I know your views on the press but people want to know what the regiments are doing.

289
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,972
Then I trust you will tell them exactly what you've observed.

290
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,779
Tricky business, Mr Bloomfield.

291
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:05,340
Look at that waste!

292
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:09,782
Five rounds ruined. Each round has to be accounted for.

293
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:15,183
It's terrible! Quite dreadful! Something must be done!

294
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:20,024
If they'd been put back in their boxes, the boxes screwed down -

295
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:22,425
as his lordship ordered -

296
00:42:22,465 --> 00:42:25,226
nothing would've happened to them.

297
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:28,149
I refer to our drowned natives.

298
00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:32,028
Natives is not on my invoices, Mr Harford.

299
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:38,191
Ammunition is, and has to accounted for, AND brass cartridge cases returned.

300
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:50,315
Several natives went under. Shouldn't we have a roll call?

301
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:55,036
Not practical - we haven't had time to make up the roll yet.

302
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:59,758
Besides, I'm not sure how many we had before the crossing.

303
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:17,925

WHY DO YOU COME TO THE LAND OF THE ZULU?

306
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,821
May I answer, sir? By all means, Mr Melvill.

307
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:15,463
WE COME HERE BY THE ORDERS OF THE GREAT QUEEN VICTORIA,

308
00:44:15,503 --> 00:44:17,985
QUEEN OF ALL AFRICA.

309
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:22,347
FORWARD!

310
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:29,190
C Company, advance! Get up!

311
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:33,951
Major, send the troops.Yes, sir.

312
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:28,391
Well done, sir! Did you see that, Noggs? >

313
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:32,551
He deceived him with the up and took him with the down.

314
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:37,393
Well, well! This one's a grandfather at least!

315
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:44,277
If he'd been a Zulu in his prime, I'd have given odds against your lancer, Melvill.

316
00:46:44,317 --> 00:46:47,036
Well, gentlemen, first blood to us!

317
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:50,758
And a rousing good report in the newspapers

318
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:53,160
to satisfy the politicians!

00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:05,445
Your destination, Colonel?

325
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:08,166

Isandhlwana - four miles further than that tallest hill.

327
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:17,970
Follow the track and it will lead us to the slopes of the mountain.

328
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,890
Isandhlwana. Yeah.

329
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,494
Isandhlwana.

330
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,821
I want your wagons in extended lines,

331
00:49:53,861 --> 00:50:00,583
but not too extended or my company can't protect them! 50 feet or less between each.

332
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:05,707
When we're too close together, they walk into each other,

333
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:08,387
and you can sit on your arse for a good four hours!

334
00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:12,428
Company, keep 'em moving! No more than 50 feet!

335
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,988
Keep 'em moving!

336
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:17,750
KEEP 'EM MOVING!

337
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:20,832

338
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:24,433

00:55:18,454 --> 00:55:22,495
They just kept coming! Blood-curdling swine!

351
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:30,257
Why did they attack you? I discovered their army. ..A valley full of them.

352
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:34,901
- What army? - Beyond them hills and coming this way.

353
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:32,401
Mr Vereker, would you mind taking a look at this map?

354
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:35,001
By all means, Colonel.

355
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:38,561
Your wagons, Colonel. What about my wagons?

356
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:44,723
On this open slope you must bring them round and form them into a laager - immediately.

357
00:56:44,763 --> 00:56:49,485
I hear you have prisoners, Colonel. Well done! Evening, William!

358
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:51,725
Thank you, sir!

359
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:57,449
I think you should hear this. Your brother didn't laager his camp... >

360
00:56:57,488 --> 00:57:02,289
They had 73 in their party - they found 73 skeletons six months later.

361
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:07,331
Boers require a laager with only a few wagons - we have many.

362
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:10,972
An unassailable square of British fire power

363
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:15,733
is a defence which can be formed in a moment. You're leaving us?

364
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:21,657
I'm going to camp among the rocks over there.

365
00:57:21,696 --> 00:57:26,379
My lord, Mr Fannin claims to have seen the Zulu Impi -

366
00:57:26,419 --> 00:57:30,778
some few thousand or so - exactly here in this valley.

367
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:36,462
Unlikely - it would mean taking 24,000 men over mountain tops.

368
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:39,103
This is not helpful!

369
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:45,224

00:58:16,515 --> 00:58:19,196
Good evening! Dirty work, eh?

374
00:58:19,236 --> 00:58:21,276
Very dirty.

375

PRISONER SPEAKS IN ZULU

377
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:42,445
What did they say?Claim they're deserters from the Impis in the east.

378
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:47,205
Followed this one so they could give themselves up, go home.

379
00:58:47,245 --> 00:58:49,526
Do you believe that?

380
00:58:49,566 --> 00:58:54,690
They're well oiled, fed regularly - it's unlikely they're fugitives.

381
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:57,691
Have them questioned further.

382
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:06,852
They claim the Impis are east towards the Royal Kraal

383
00:59:06,894 --> 00:59:11,293
and yet this fellow says they're further towards the north.

384
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:14,775
Wherever they are, there are 60,000 or more.

385
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,498
They multiply, Mr Fannin. You speak the Zulu tongue?

386
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:23,419
Tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu Impi and you will accompany me.

387
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:28,141
I'm no soldier, your honour, and it's further into Zululand.

388
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:32,021
You will accompany me or you will me arrested.

389
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,463
This way, Mr Fannin.

390
00:59:34,503 --> 00:59:39,024
Crealock, we have scouts where he claims he saw the Zulus?

391
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:41,185
Of course, sir.And?

392
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:43,946
The only reports of enemy activity

393
00:59:43,986 --> 00:59:48,787
have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.

394
00:59:48,827 --> 00:59:51,229
Thank you.

395
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:02,672
Why don't the Zulus attack?

396
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:07,194
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like

397
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:11,516
but that doesn't mean to say they've got no brains.

398
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:14,997
They'll watch us and wait - find our weaknesses.

399
01:00:15,036 --> 01:00:18,037

I have intelligence that the Zulu head north to threaten your left.

Intelligence?! Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours?!

480
01:11:53,838 --> 01:11:59,561
especially in an enemy's country - before knowing their dispositions.

because if he sinks, then you sink with him.

523
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:16,289
FALL IN!

524
01:18:16,329 --> 01:18:18,732
AT THE DOUBLE!

525
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:23,173
FALL IN! COME ON, LADS!

526
01:18:23,213 --> 01:18:25,615
AT THE DOUBLE!

527
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:04,948
Wheel 'em in! Wheel 'em in! Wheel 'em in!

528
01:19:07,468 --> 01:19:09,869
Come on, now!

529
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:12,390
Tighten those ranks!

530
01:19:15,912 --> 01:19:21,073
Private Storey, get those range markers pegged out at the double -

531
01:19:21,113 --> 01:19:23,393
one every 100 yards!

532
01:19:23,433 --> 01:19:28,036
Make sure he pegs them in a straight line TOWARDS the enemy.

533
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,918
Hold them, please, God!

534
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:37,398
For three minutes, please hold them!

535
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:41,081
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, men!

536

01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:53,283
Oi! You useless little bastard. Come here!

01:20:56,026 --> 01:20:59,627
I want to establish camp here immediately.Certainly, sir.

543
01:21:01,227 --> 01:21:07,430
After lunch, Brown, you shall return to Isandhlwana and instruct Col Pulleine to join us here.

544
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:13,351
If you'll excuse me, my lord. No appetite, Colonel?

545
01:21:13,391 --> 01:21:18,675
My men last ate yesterday and have no supplies until I get them back to Isandhlwana.

546
01:21:18,715 --> 01:21:22,274
They can start now and you can join them when you've eaten.

547
01:21:22,314 --> 01:21:27,197
It wouldn't be proper for me to sit at your table,

548
01:21:27,236 --> 01:21:31,238
they with their bellies stuck to their backbones.

549
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:35,759
Excuse me, sir.

Learn nothing from that Irishman, Harford, except how NOT to behave.

Here, here!

01:21:58,048 --> 01:22:00,689
A strange message from Vereker.

554
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:05,249
It would seem that Pulleine has a battle on his hands.

555
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:07,731
No details. No intelligence.

556
01:22:08,771 --> 01:22:13,253
Mr Milne, kindly take your telescope to a high point

557
01:22:13,293 --> 01:22:15,734
and note events at Isandhlwana.

558

Come all this bloody way to get shot by a bullet from Birmingham!

01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,992
Shoot straight, you bastards!

I'm running out of bleeding ammunition! Bugler!

Go on! Run both ways!

01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:21,701
Soft-headed buggers, these! Flatten out against the bone! Smash 'em out!

610
01:30:21,741 --> 01:30:25,703
But bullets run out. Those spears don't.

611
01:30:27,144 --> 01:30:29,744
Pullen!

612
01:30:29,784 --> 01:30:34,666
Do not issue ammunition from this wagon to any unauthorised company.

613
01:30:34,706 --> 01:30:38,267
This lot have their own. SPEAKS BANTU

614
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:41,308
Go and get it from your own wagon.

615
01:30:41,348 --> 01:30:43,870
How long have we got to wait?

616
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:47,151
- Get back in line! - But, sir!

617
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:49,510
Move!

618
01:30:50,992 --> 01:30:55,713

01:31:01,235 --> 01:31:03,236

My lord!

624
01:31:22,442 --> 01:31:26,124
My lord, I watched the camp for 20 minutes.

625
01:31:26,164 --> 01:31:30,046
The haze obscures much. The tents have not been struck

626
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:33,565
but the wagons have been moved into the camp.

627
01:31:33,605 --> 01:31:38,849
Thank you, Mr Milne. Inform Col Crealock, will you?Sir!

628
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:09,618
Thank you, Milne.

629
01:32:13,459 --> 01:32:17,541
The camp is under attack. Pulleine sends for help.

630
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:20,343
Be calm! Where do you come by this?

631
01:32:20,383 --> 01:32:25,664
Durnford's carbineer rode in. Col Harness has turned the artillery.

632
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:28,105
They have?

633
01:32:28,145 --> 01:32:33,707
I see. Ride out to Lord Chelmsford and acquaint him with this.

634
01:32:34,989 --> 01:32:37,348
Mr Harford!

635
01:32:37,388 --> 01:32:42,951
Control your passions! The professional soldier must keep cool.

636
01:32:52,034 --> 01:32:54,754
INCESSANT GUNFIRE

637
01:33:02,676 --> 01:33:05,118
Good work, Vereker!

638
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:07,518
Prepare to fall back!

639
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,923
Move the horses! Move, men!

640
01:33:35,008 --> 01:33:37,049

641
01:33:37,089 --> 01:33:39,130

642
01:33:44,891 --> 01:33:48,374
FIND THE HIGH GROUND!

643
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:15,781
Speed the ammunition flow. I'll try and hold the road to Rorke's Drift.

644
01:34:27,427 --> 01:34:30,068
Sergeant, come with me!

645
01:34:53,675 --> 01:34:55,875

647
01:35:09,561 --> 01:35:13,042
BOTH RANKS RETREAT!

648
01:35:30,728 --> 01:35:33,608
SAVE THOSE GUNS!

658
01:38:10,703 --> 01:38:13,145
Quickly, trooper!

659
01:38:23,389 --> 01:38:26,310

662
01:39:12,364 --> 01:39:16,926
Well fought, gentlemen! It's time to save the Colours.

663
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:21,128
Get to Rorke's Drift. You must warn them.

664
01:39:21,168 --> 01:39:23,688
The Colours!

665
01:39:26,729 --> 01:39:29,451
Carry them to safety, Mr Melvill.

666
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:31,971

667
01:39:48,297 --> 01:39:51,618
SERGEANT! SERGEANT!

668
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:53,898
Take my horse!

669
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,141
Off you go! Sergeant, ride back to Natal.

670
01:39:59,181 --> 01:40:02,742
Tell the bishop - that is, tell his daughter -

671
01:40:02,782 --> 01:40:06,383
I was obliged to remain here with my infantry.

672
01:40:06,423 --> 01:40:09,145
Now go! God go with you!

673
01:40:09,185 --> 01:40:11,825
I leave God Jesus with you.

674
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,355
MOVE IT!

675
01:41:41,578 --> 01:41:45,458
Give them to me! Come on!

676
01:41:45,498 --> 01:41:47,938
COME ON!

677
01:44:46,241 --> 01:44:50,602
For God's sake, hold them back! I'll get the horses!

678
01:44:52,122 --> 01:44:54,722
It's all right! It's all right!

ANGUISHED CRY

680
01:47:50,143 --> 01:47:54,665
Excuse me, my lord, there's something I must convey to you.

681
01:47:54,705 --> 01:47:58,547
I rode a little along the track to Rorke's Drift -

682
01:47:58,587 --> 01:48:01,027
the sky is red with fire.

683
01:48:02,349 --> 01:48:05,148
Your orders, my lord?

684
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:07,789
Do we move to the Drift?

685
01:48:33,319 --> 01:48:35,720
