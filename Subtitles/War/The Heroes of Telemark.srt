Los! Runter! Runter vom Wagen!

3
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,629
Major Frick! Major Frick!

4
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,151
Tell the commandant of Rjukan

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,272
that an attempt has been made
on the Reich-Comissar's life!

6
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,790
Arrange for 15 civilians
from Telemark to be shot in reprisal!

(Rhythmic dripping)

10
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,750
- Like the look of it, gentlemen?
- Most interesting.

11
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,316
We are well informed
of what you do, Herr Nilssen.

12
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,159
Just experimentation with heavy water.

13
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,999
With deuterium oxide. Yes, we know.

14
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,191
Nilssen, l must tell you...

15
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,678
the time has come to make
a transition from theory to practice.

16
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,350
You've done enough experimentation,
my dear fellow.

17
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,759
This room has more significance for us
than you can possibly realise.

18
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,192
One day perhaps he will realise,
don't you think, gentlemen?

19
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,277
Forget about fertilisers.

20
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,471
This factory is required by the Reich

21
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,478
to increase its production
of heavy water by 400%.

22
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,514
We want 10,000 pounds
of heavy water by Easter next year.

23
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,030
- That's impossible.
- Not at all, Herr Nilssen.

24
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,879
What is necessary
will always be accomplished.

25
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,311
All the more so when the whole future
of the Reich is at stake.

26
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,752
All the technical details
have been worked out in Berlin. Look.

27
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,112
Notice also our modification
of the deuterium formula.

28
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,313
But what is the reason?
l don't understand.

29
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,318
(Shots echoing)

30
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,273
That was a firing squad, my dear Nilssen.

31
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,395
Let it be a warning.
Major Frick will be in charge of security

32
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,636
and it will be the maximum.

33
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,799

Sorry, he's busy.
He's working in the darkroom.

40
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,512
You can't go barging in

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,473
How long is he likely to be there?

42
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,830
Could be there all afternoon.

43
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,071

l've got to give you a message.

49
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,870

near the Norsk-Hydro factory.

53
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,953
l come from Chief Engineer Nilssen.

54
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,149
He wants your opinion on something.
He says only you would understand it.

55
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,033
- Understand what?
- The message.

What the devil is heavy water?

138
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,439
lt's a liquid with a heavier hydrogen
structure than ordinary water.

useful in atomic energy.

ln the formula that Nilssen sent,

142
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,154
the Germans have added
a new component to the equation...

143
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,116
Wait till that formula's been examined

144
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,517
by Professor Einstein
and Dr Oppenheimer in New York.

145
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,748
Surely it's something more than just
a doubt that brought you to England?

146
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,191
lt is. lt's a very great fear.

147
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,110
lf it's justified,
we'll know about it soon enough.

This is Professor Sir Roderick Logan.

153
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,676
Gentlemen, perhaps l should tell you -

154
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,871
or perhaps l should not tell you -

155
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,278
that we have just come from
a very brief and very painful session

156
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,596
with the Prime Minister on this.

157
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,279
Ah.

158
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,637
At any rate, here is the report that came
from Washington this morning.

159
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,310
Following their initial reading
of the data brought by Dr Pedersen,

160
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,114
plus certain other indicators -

161
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,791
incidentally, Professors Einstein,
Fermi and Oppenheimer concurring,

162
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,232
the scientific and military consensus
in America is...

163
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,628
that the Germans may be ahead of us

164
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,957
in the race to achieve
controlled atomic fission.

165
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,116
lf they are ahead
and they get their atomic bomb...

166
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,311
they've won the war.

167
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,714
There you are, Knut.
How are you? Come in.

168
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,996
- Come in, Mr Straud.
- Thank you.

169
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,720
- Come on in. Take a chair.
- Thank you.

170
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,515
We've examined the situation carefully

171
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,188
and it's been agreed
in London and Washington

172
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,750
that the factory making heavy water
must be destroyed.

173
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,750
l agree with you, Bill, that bombing
is the most obvious method.

174
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,751
At the same time, we wish, if we can,
to avoid large-scale civilian death,

175
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,111
which is also the wish
of the Norwegian government.

176
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,915
l suggest that Dr Pedersen,
who knows what's at stake,

177
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,271
and Mr Straud,
who knows his country backwards,

178
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,359
be asked to return to Telemark
in order to resolve this question.

179
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,028
That is to determine, with objectivity,

180
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,789
whether a ground attack by commandos
is practical or not.

181
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,558
Agreed?

182
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,193
Agreed.

183
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,552
- How do we get back to Norway?
- The simplest way. By parachute.

184
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,239
We're miles off course
but l know where we are.

185
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,670
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

186
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,711
Yes, if you're a reindeer.

187
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,640
Where do we go from here?

188
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,593
l'm taking you
to one of my radio operators.

189
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,950
He's our contact with London.

190
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,991
Now what?

191
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,155
Over that mountain. A farmhouse.
Another one of my operators.

192
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,590
(Wind howling)

193
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,711
l know this place.

194
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,677
Oh, Knut Straud!

195
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,595
- Come in. How are you?
- Fine.

196
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,477
Wonderful to see you.

197
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,995
- Hello, Anna.
- Good God, what are you doing here?

198
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,033
Well, just dropped in for a cup of coffee.

199
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,633
Uncle!

200
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,751
- Uncle!
- What is it?

201
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,270
- Rolf is here.
- Oh, damn!

202
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,590
- Hello, Uncle.
- What on earth are you doing here?

203
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,189
Mr Straud, always good to see you.

204
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,960
- You know each other too?
- We've met.

205
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,756
What a surprise. l had no idea
you were all such good friends.

206
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,791
Hadn't you?

207
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,270
You ought to know we've put you
in danger by coming here.

208
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,790
- What?
- We're working for the Resistance.

209
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,468
You? You're not serious?

210
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,638
- Well, he got me into it.
- Was that wise, Knut?

211
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,308
You seem to know each other quite well.

212
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,517
Oh, everybody knows everybody here.

213
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,188
Let me introduce you to my ex-wife.

214
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,269
- Can we have some coffee, Anna?
- l've no time for coffee.

215
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,596
l'm working for the Resistance.

216
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,837
We both can't be working
for the Resistance.

217
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,871
You look terrible.

218
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,674
He's been dragging me around
for two days.

219
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,759
There's pyjamas and hot water upstairs.
Go up to the bedroom.

220
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,119
l take it you know the way?

221
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,516
Yeah, l know the way.

222
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,950
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

223
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,959
lt's odd to have him in the house again.

224
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,119
What's odd about it? You and he
shared the same bed for two years.

225
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,551
As far as l remember,
you damn seldom got out of it.

226
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,994
- You should be asleep.
- l just thought l'd drop in.

227
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,031
All in the line of duty.

228
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,075
To discuss Resistance tactics
with a fellow fighter.

229
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,032
How's your resistance these days?

230
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,868
Fine. How's yours?

231
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,678
Mine?

232
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,396
Well, it was great until l met
that boy scout, Knut Straud.

233
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,431
Well...

234
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,313
l was content, l had a good life...

235
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,035
and now look where l am.

236
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,231
lt's exhausting
to commit yourself to others.

237
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,319
You still commit yourself beautifully.

238
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,351
Like you always did.

239
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,394
l'm not your wife now, Rolf.

240
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,518
l know.

241
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,235
You're not anybody's wife, are you?

242
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,318
- Go to bed.
- Sure.

243
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,988
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

244
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,071
You mean you would?

245
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,717
- You know what you were born for.
- No.

246
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,071
You know what you were born for.
Tell me.

247
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,511
Say those things to me.

248
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,554
Your voice...never out of my head.

249
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,432
You're the same. You're my love...

250
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,313
Yes, you are.

251
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,240
You've got the words wrong, Rolf.

252
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,633
You see, it's not so easy
seducing your ex-wife.

253
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,479
Students are much easier, aren't they?

254
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,633
l just don't believe in you any more.

255
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,830
- Anna...
- Please go.

256
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,831
Please.

257
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,071
Sleep well.

258
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,870
We'll make this our main transmitter hut.
Can't risk the farm.

259
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,833
l'll make sure Nilssen is at the church.

260
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,155
Good.

261
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,033
Uncle, be careful.
The town is full of Germans.

262
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,279
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
See you in church.

263
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,311
Merry Christmas!

264
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,035
(Congregation sing Silent Night)

265
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,232
Sigrid.

266
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,197
That's Arne's wife?

267
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,355
l've got a message for you from Arne.

268
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,076
- He's in England. He's fine.
- Will you see him again?

269
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,150
l have a message for him too -
he'll be a father in the spring.

270
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,354
They'll have their 10,000 pounds
of heavy water by Easter.

271
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,997
The marker - microfilm of the factory.

272
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,031
Exact details.

273
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,554
(Gurgling)

274
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,628
Ammonia and hydrogen pipes.

275
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,559
You see how close it is to the village?

276
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,711
Look how near the factory is
to their homes.

277
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,037
Look at the rabbit!

278
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,718
Land mines.

279
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,559
(lndistinct shouting)

280
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,471
Come on.

281
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,637
(Door opens)

282
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,671
(Soldier) Excuse me.

283
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,994
l don't think l've seen you
in Rjukan before. Who are you?

284
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,433
l've come to, er, visit my fiancée...
for Christmas.

285
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,676
l see. Your fiancée.

286
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,509
How very charming indeed.
And what is his name?

287
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,870
- My name...
- l'm asking her.

288
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,036
Jan Christensen.

289
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,992
Mm-hm.

290
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,308
Let me see your identity card, please.

291
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,351
Certainly.

292
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,911
Excuse me.

293
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,111
Here it is.

294
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,035
Oh.

295
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,712
Uh-huh.

296
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,430
Your text, l believe?

297
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,151
Yes, sir.

298
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,350
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

299
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,437
Auf wiedersehen.

300
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,997
Oh, and the compliments
of the season to both of you.

301
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,789
- How did you like our town, Rolf?
- l liked it.

302
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,549
You should have seen
the torch-light parades we used to have.

303
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,591
Yes. Every November.

304
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,873
Flaming torches. You could see it
from miles away in the mountains.

305
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,231
- The snow was whiter then.
- Yes.

306
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,829
lt was all the lights on the snow.

307
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,511
Then we made snowballs and threw
them at the torches. Remember, Knut?

308
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,835
(Rolf) This is a detailed layout
of the factory.

309
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,839
They've got 3,000 pounds of heavy water
ready to be shipped to Germany.

310
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,271
Let's decide on what message
we send to London.

311
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,433
There's only one message.

312
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,760
We've examined the area. Consider
ground attack totally impractical.

313
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,993
Recommend alternate method.

314
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,191
You mean to bomb it?

315
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,916
Yes.

316
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,793
lt would destroy Rjukan
and everybody in it.

317
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,998
Possibly.

318
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,871
Bombing is impossible. The factory
is deeply embedded in a gorge.

319
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,193
The one way across that gorge
is a narrow bridge 75 feet long.

320
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,914
Two men could hold off a battalion.

321
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,557
l can get inside that factory with ten men
and blow it sky-high!

322
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,228
They've got 88mm guns on every hill.

323
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,274
And without destroying
an entire village in the process.

324
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,994
Barbed wire, land mines.

325
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,034
- 6,000 lives. Do you realise...?
- Anna, keep out of this.

326
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,194
This is something that affects the world.

327
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,755
l don't give a damn about the world.

328
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,873
l'm talking about my town,
her town, his town. We live there.

329
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,436
l'm talking about people.
Do you understand? People!

330
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,235
You weren't so squeamish
when hostages were being shot.

331
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,590
lt's more important than a few trucks...

332
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,837
- l was doing my job.
- And l'm doing mine!

333
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,077
l don't like it and l didn't ask for it.

334
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,839
Anna...

335
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,068
you live here, it's natural you want
to save your own people's lives but...

336
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,748
this is something that has to be done.

337
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,479
lt's important.

338
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,672
lmportant enough to kill 6,000 people?

339
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,199
Yes.

340
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,753
Look...

341
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,794
l want to know what's so important
about heavy water.

342
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,719
l don't make the rules. l can't tell you.

343
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,480
l want to know
and you're going to tell me.

344
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,830
l'm telling you nothing.

345
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,750
Do you think that l'm going to sacrifice
the lives of 6,000 people

346
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,633
on the opinion of a playboy scientist?

347
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,879
For what? l want to know
and you're going to tell me.

348
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,308
You want to know what it's all about?
All right. l'll tell you.

349
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,196
That's what it's all about.

350
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,798
You understand?

351
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,639
- Of course you don't.
- Why, you...!

352
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,233
Stop it! Stop it!

353
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,670
l thought you boys
were here to fight the Nazis.

354
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,115
Why don't you both send in reports
and let London decide?

355
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,788
- All right.
- Fine.

356
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,876
See, Anna?

357
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,995
Knut and l fight but we still manage
to live with each other.

358
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,999
(Engine spluttering)

359
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,513
l know you're anxious
to get back to Norway.

360
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,917
Knut Straud and Rolf Pedersen are
on the mountains of Telemark waiting.

361
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,351
The main assault group -
the Royal Engineers Commando -

362
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,790
will come in two or three days.

363
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,391
We're counting on you to get
a glider landing strip on the lake ready.

364
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,876
Well, happy landings. Best of luck.

365
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,914
(Laughing)

366
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,238
Where have you been? We've been
halfway round the Arctic Circle!

367
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,230
We've been waiting for your message
for five weeks and it hasn't come!

368
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,637
- l'm starving!
- We're expecting company tomorrow.

369
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,308
- 50 commandos.
- They land tomorrow.

370
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,636
l've got a message for you from Sigrid.

371
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,673
You're going to have a baby
in the spring!

372
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,679
- How is she?
- She's pregnant.

373
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,196
Rolf!

374
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,072
- Who are you?
- My name is Jensen.

375
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,033
- What do you want?
- l'm on a hunting trip.

376
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,310
Hunting for what?

377
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,750
You'd better come with us.

378
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,600
l won't say a word. Ever.

379
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,472
On my honour.

380
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,908
Look...

381
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:07,035
My village is Hochlai.
Anyone there will tell you who l am.

382
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,109
l hate the Nazis, believe me.

383
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,675
My wife is in a Gestapo prison.

384
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,757
Listen. Her father's name is Yon Trend.

385
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,155
- That's why she's in prison.
- Trend?

386
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,919
- The Resistance leader?
- Yes.

387
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,838
lt fits.

388
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,871
Shoot him.

389
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,718
We'll keep him.

390
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,629
You can't risk the whole organisation
because of one man.

391
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,912
- l'm with Knut.
- l think Rolf is right.

392
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,951
So do l.

393
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,715
We'll have a show of hands.
Those against shooting him.

394
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,356
We'll have your skis. Take them off.

395
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,513
(Jolly whistling)

396
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,953
(Men join in humming)

397
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,911
Listen.

398
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,151
(Faint whirring of engines)

399
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,949
(Engines spluttering)

400
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,273
(Whining as plane dives)

401
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,471
l still can't believe it.

402
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,674
- They weren't even Norwegian.
- 50 British commandos.

403
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,110
ln a flash, the whole operation's over.

404
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,630
The waste. That's what
l can't get out of my head.

405
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,155
They're not going to be wasted.

406
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,593
We're going ahead. Tonight. Now.
As if they were with us.

407
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,270
- lt's the same plan. We all know it.
- What are you talking about?

408
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,438
We're going to complete
the mission ourselves.

409
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,552
- Knut, you're mad.
- We'd better wait.

410
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,230
lt'll be months before
they can mount a similar assault.

411
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,510
- Knut...
- lt's our only chance.

412
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,951
lf we win, those men won't have died
for nothing tonight.

413
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,072
There were 50 of them. Only nine of us.

414
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,999
- You won't even be nine.
- What do you mean?

415
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,835
l'm sorry, but l'm not going on
such an impossible mission.

416
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,478
Oh yes, you are, Rolf.
You're coming with us.

417
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,390
You're the only one who knows exactly
where that dynamite must be placed.

418
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,513
After tonight, that factory's
going to be jumping with guards.

419
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,359
- He's right.
- Now listen! Listen to me!

420
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,872
They have completely wiped out
our entire assault force, right?

421
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,117
- They'll be feeling safe.
- You don't have a chance.

422
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,356
50 men died tonight.

423
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,189
They came here to help us.
They weren't even Norwegian.

424
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,639
Well...who's coming with me tonight?

425
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,719
lt's ten to 12. This is an operation
launched by the British.

426
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,754
We'll wear British uniforms
so the Germans won't shoot hostages.

427
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,710
(Knut) The attack will take place at 3:15.

428
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,438
Arne, you and Henrik
will be our cover party.

429
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,758
You'll cut a hole in the fence.
The demolition party will consist...

430
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,999
The demolition party
will consist of Knut, Oli and myself.

431
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,151
Jensen? lnside.

432
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,949
(Vehicle approaching)

433
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,791
(Loud click)

434
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,077
- Gute Nacht.
- Draußen ist's kalt.

435
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,396
Gut, ich bin warm angezogen.

436
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,830
(Car engine starting)

437
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,711
(Loud click)

438
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,316
(Machinery humming)

439
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,593
Hello...

440
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,838
Hello.

441
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,711
Fritz, mach die Tür zu!

442
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,753
Be careful with those wires.
You will blow the whole place up.

443
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,271
- Ready?
- Yeah.

444
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,356
- Let's get out of here.
- My glasses! l've lost my glasses.

445
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,597
- They're on your head.
- What's going to happen to me?

446
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,836
We'll put you somewhere safe.

447
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,911
(Klaxon blaring)

448
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,030
(Shouting in German)

449
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,071
(Gunfire)

450
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,432
(Shouting in German)

451
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,670
(Firing stops)

452
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,158
Scheinwerfer jetzt da! Lass sie nicht...

453
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,635
(Gunfire)

454
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,151
Go on. Go on.

455
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:33,314
Gentlemen, your next mission
is to find out how neutral Sweden is.

456
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,590
Especially the girls.

457
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,270
Where's Arne?

458
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,078
Down in the gorge.

459
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,831
Let's get going.

460
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,350
lt'll be swarming with Germans
in half an hour.

461
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,159
Excellent.

462
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,918
Excellent work.

463
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,429
ls it not, my dear Nilssen?

464
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,235
An extraordinary job, you might say,
of sabotage.

465
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,834
Naturally, you had no knowledge of this.

466
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,873
Destruction, sabotage, waste.

467
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,797
All this is against
your thrifty scientific nature.

468
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,831
ls it not, Nilssen?

469
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,119
ln that case, answer me this.

470
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,915
How long before production
gets back into high gear?

471
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,271
A year at least -
new containers have to be built,

472
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,948
a new store
of heavy water accumulated -

473
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,237
before production flows at full speed.

474
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,237
A year, he says.

475
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,069
What do you think we Germans
have been doing? Sleeping?

476
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,478
What do you think your friends from
the Berlin lnstitute have been doing?

477
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,318
Playing golf?

478
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,911
The British fancy themselves very much
after what they've done here.

479
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,749
Winston Churchill is puffing
an extra big cigar today.

480
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,469
And we laugh at him.

481
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,238
Why?

482
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,956
Because all these containers
which the British did so much to destroy

483
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,835
have already been
prefabricated...in Berlin.

484
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,874
They are on their way here
and will be installed tomorrow.

485
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,516
l must say that is fantastic efficiency.

486
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,349
Don't ever make the mistake
of underrating the Germans.

487
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,950
By Easter, we will not have
10,000 pounds of heavy water

488
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,799
but 12,000 pounds of heavy water.

489
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,949
Because from now on, no one leaves
this building - not you or anybody -

490
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,993
unless it's to go
to Grini concentration camp.

491
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,509
l must protest against this.

492
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,995
Protest as much as you wish...

493
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,189
but get used to the idea!

494
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,231
You built this place.

495
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,195
You will work now in it, eat in it
and sleep in it until our victory.

496
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,358
Heil Hitler.

497
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,119
Major Frick.

498
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,791
This is one of the most disastrous
security breakdowns of the entire war

499
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,036
and you are responsible for it.

500
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:07,438
l leave you in charge of the only factory
in Europe making heavy water

501
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,552
and a dozen men in British uniforms
calmly walk in

502
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,990
and blow it up right in front of your eyes.

503
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,078
So get up into those mountains!

504
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,671
And get back every one of those men.
Dead or alive.

505
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,713
lf it turns out they're Norwegians,

506
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,469
l want a hundred hostages
rounded up and shot.

507
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,950
l don't want even a rat left alive up there!

508
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,832
Go on, get out!

509
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,476
Fertig machen! Abmarschieren!
Einsteigen! Abfahren!

510
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,671
Mit voller Ausrüstung.

511
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,072
You say you can take us to them?
You'd better be telling the truth.

512
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,430
You keep your part of the bargain,
l'll keep mine.

513
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,472
You were right.
We should have shot that quisling...

514
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,352
Forget it.

515
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,391
(Plane whirring)

516
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,560
(Machine-gun fire)

517
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,752
Abteilung 2 da lang.
Der Rest folgt mir nach.

518
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,913
Knut, go down that side.

519
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,995
(Gunfire)

520
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,398
(Gunshot)

521
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,038
(Gunshot)

522
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,157
Why?

523
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,998
Why?

524
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,479
My wife...

525
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,593
Your wife? What the hell do you mean,
your wife?

526
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,838
l made a bargain with the Nazis.

527
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,391
Who are you?

528
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,071
l was helping track down the saboteurs.
l got hurt in the foot.

529
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,716
You'd better come with us.
Abteilung vorwärts!

530
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,151
Abteilung halt! Wegtreten!

531
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,511
Saboteurs, going to
Grini concentration camp.

532
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,032
l...l think l'd better go see my doctor.

533
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,196
Thanks for your help.

534
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,917
Hey, wait a minute.

535
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,477
We have a doctor here now.
Come and see him.

536
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,717
l'd rather see my own
if it's all the same to you.

537
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,074
Oh, nonsense. Our doctor will look after
you for nothing. Why pay a civilian?

538
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,874
- Who is this fellow?
- One of the men helping our patrols.

539
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,070
lf he's helping us, we must help him.

540
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,589
- Thank you.
- That's only fair.

541
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,676
Nasty. We'd better have that seen to.

542
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,711
Herr Sturmführer!

543
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,953
l think we have got another person
for your bus.

544
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,072
Doctor?

545
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,238
- You remember me?
- No, l don't.

546
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,079
We met at the university, Dr Pedersen.

547
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,795
- l'm afraid you're mistaken, madam.
- You know this man?

548
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,151
No, l... l thought l did but l... No.

549
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,237
What did you say his name was?

550
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,670
No, please. l don't know.

551
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,796
His papers say Christensen.
What did you say?

552
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,638
His name!

553
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,196
My name is Dr Rolf Pedersen,
University of Oslo.

554
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,313
As Gestapo Headquarters will no doubt
be delighted to confirm.

555
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,113
Doctor...

556
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,151
l'm so sorry.

557
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:24,114
- Pederson...
- Pedersen, not Pederson.

558
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,311
l'm very proud of my name.

559
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,875
Let me help you. Here it is.

560
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,517
''Pedersen, Rolf. Doctor of Physics.
Believed escaped to England.''

561
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:39,269
- England?
- Even the Gestapo can be wrong.

562
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,078
Schnell! Schnell!

563
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,596
How long will it be, Doctor?

564
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,717
l've got to leave here.

565
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,749
Can you hear me, Doctor?
l can't stay here long.

566
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,795
l don't want to know who you are
but if you leave you'll be arrested

567
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,991
and so will l and my staff.

568
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,875
You will therefore stay here
until l make the arrangements.

569
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,351
(Tapping)

570
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:30,593
Anna, l told you l don't want
you using that transmitter set.

571
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,509
- London must know where Rolf is.
- l can't risk it.

572
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,915
Why can't you try to find him?

573
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,351
l'm not a member
of the Missing Person's Bureau.

574
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:46,118
l can't jeopardise the whole operation.

575
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,117
l am a bad ex-wife, Knut.

576
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,432
Why? Because you love him?

577
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,112
Yes. You haven't much use for that,
have you?

578
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,153
Not in this sort of war. lt softens you up.

579
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,115
But sex - now, that's something different.

580
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,510
lt seems Rolf makes
the same distinction.

581
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,830
But you don't, do you, Anna?

582
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,751
l'll get some wood.

583
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,236
They're in this area somewhere.

584
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,231
(Rhythmic tapping)

585
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,996
Leave that alone! Not for anyone!
Do you understand?

586
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,829
That transmitter remains silent
until l give the order!

587
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,269
You see, Anna,
that's what l was talking about.

588
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,193
- Morning.
- Hello, Doctor.

589
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,709
A friend of yours is here.

590
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,150
Room seven, down the corridor.

591
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,871
(Knock on door)

592
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,632
- Sigrid.
- Hello, Dr Pedersen.

593
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,593
l thought you were locked up
in the factory.

594
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,598
We are, unless we're very ill.

595
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,791
Or having a baby.

596
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:50,875
- There's something l've got to...
- Nilssen found out you were here.

597
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,116
Listen to me.

598
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,113
- l've got to tell you about Arne.
- l know.

599
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,711
The Germans
have installed new containers,

600
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,230
so heavy water production
is at full level again.

601
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,032
- Sigrid...
- When can you deliver the message?

602
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,271
Right now.

603
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,549
- We've got to contact London.
- Why? What's the matter?

604
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,797
The Nazis have restored
heavy water production.

605
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,675
- What?
- lt's taken two weeks, not two years.

606
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,711
We're back where we started.

607
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,910
Then we'll have to bomb.

608
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,759
(Planes droning)

609
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,393
(Sirens wailing)

610
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,471
(Explosions and gunfire)

611
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,595
We'll have to take his appendix out.

612
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,271
ln that case one of our security officers
must remain with him day and night.

613
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,315
l shan't be lonely. By the way,
how are Sigrid and her baby?

614
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,354
Excellent. She's bringing him here later
for a check-up.

615
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,916
- l'd love to see her.
- No one can communicate with Nilssen.

616
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:33,035
''67 civilians killed.
Factory virtually untouched.

617
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,071
''The Nazis...''

618
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,436
The Third Reich is going to last
for a thousand years.

619
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:48,792
Let's all go to Rjukan. Have a good
Nazi dinner, see a nice Nazi film.

620
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,070
- Rolf.
- Start getting used to it.

621
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,750
''The Nazis are shipping
all their heavy water to Germany

622
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,919
''by rail and ferry under the guard
of a thousand troops.

623
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,910
''The railway tank cars will leave
the factory Saturday evening.

624
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:09,478
''Be placed...on the Hydro ferry...
Sunday morning.''

625
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,638
And Nilssen lost his appendix
to deliver that.

626
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,832
Wait a minute. Wait a minute..

627
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,871
Maybe now -

628
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,710
the very moment we've all dreaded
when they take the stuff to Germany...

629
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,388
by ferry.

630
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,431
This is where we get them.

631
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,154
But, Rolf, a thousand troops?

632
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,114
But there's one place
you can't use a thousand troops.

633
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,559
Knut, do you want to do
a little dying with me?

634
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,513
l've just thought up a nice way to go.

635
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,229
lt left at nine o'clock.

636
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:08,992
lt's got to be the deepest point -
at least three, four hundred metres.

637
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:11,878
Now.

638
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,718
9:45.

639
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,440
You know what we're talking about?

640
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,108
Yes. We're talking about murder.

641
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:30,595
(Clocks ticking)

642
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,475
Why two clocks?

643
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,875
lf one doesn't go off, the other will.

644
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,548
To sink the ferry in less than a minute.

645
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,756
lt has to be done, Anna.

646
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,279
lt's all been calculated, hasn't it, Rolf?

647
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,308
Nothing left to chance.

648
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,398
Not even the hope
that one child won't drown.

649
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,754
Anna, what counts isn't
who's going to die in the ferry

650
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:09,157
but how many millions
will be saved if the ferry's sunk.

651
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,478
A nice equation, Rolf.
Put it on the blackboard and sign it.

652
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:18,434
lt's not a ''nice'' equation.
l didn't invent it. lt exists.

653
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:21,234
So do people. People exist too.

654
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,715
We're doing this for people!

655
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,275
You don't do things for people.

656
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,711
Anna, this work is tough enough
even without you.

657
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,034
One day, after the war,

658
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,869
a woman is going to ask
why her child had to be drowned.

659
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,275
l won't know the answer.

660
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:47,158
lt's simple as this - we have no choice.

661
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,750
What are you going to say
to that woman, Rolf?

662
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,190
We'll radio the Norwegian government
in London.

663
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,755
Tell them the plan, all its risks...

664
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,117
The Prime Minister, the King -
the whole lot.

665
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,749
Then, if they approve...

666
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:20,471
at least we've shared the responsibility.

667
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,716
(Explosion, clocks ring)

668
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,871
lt works.

669
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,271
Let's contact London.

670
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,830
Number one truck reports a contact
on 247 degrees.

671
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,110
Contact 73 degrees.

672
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,716
West south-west.
Six kilometres from here.

673
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,353
All right, Heine!

674
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,070
Shut that door, will you?

675
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:05,075
- That's better.
- l'm glad you think so.

676
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,111
Stand up!

677
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,559
lf we're not back in two hours,
don't wait for us.

678
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,752
lf you hear any shots, leave immediately.

679
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,831
(Faint voices)

680
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,954
(Ticking)

681
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,749
(Train approaching)

682
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,875
(Train whistle blaring)

683
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,878
(Train whistle blaring)

684
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,631
(Man) Another one.

685
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,308
(Conversation continues, indistinct)

686
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,391
(Train whistle)

687
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,511
There is nine minutes left.

688
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:11,554
- Go on to the boathouse with Knut.
- Where are you going?

689
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,515
