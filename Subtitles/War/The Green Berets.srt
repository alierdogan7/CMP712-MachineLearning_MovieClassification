00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,470
- Thanks, Doc.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,989
There he is.
Right on time.

174
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,796
Quite a character.
A tour in Korea...

175
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:44,027
...a year in Vietnam.

176
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:47,274
Speaks 3 languages.
Are you sure about this soldier?

177
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,835
What do you mean?

178
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:52,955
I checked his jump record. Every time,
the jumpmaster has to push him out.

179
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:54,709
That's why I want him.

180
00:12:55,996 --> 00:12:57,793
He won't quit.

181
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,872
KIRBY:
Hold it, soldier!

182
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:17,268
Nice day.

183
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:18,631
Yes, sir.

184
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,946
Kind of out of your territory,
aren't you?

185
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,065
Yes, sir.

186
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,555
What are you doing here?

187
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,753
Watching a basketball game.

188
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:34,028
What were you doing here yesterday?

189
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:36,870
And the day before?
And the day before that?

190
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:41,155
You spend so much time here, you'd
think you wanted to join our outfit.

191
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:46,984
No, I don't think I'd care
to join the Fifth Group, sir.

192
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:51,787
I'm sorry to hear that, soldier.

193
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:53,071
Muldoon.

194
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:56,069
- Yes, sir.
KIRBY: Carry on.

195
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:07,869
What's that?

196
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,272
Lt's the fella I was telling you about.

197
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:14,984
Pull!

198
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:19,873
Hello, soldier.

199
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,474
So you decided to volunteer.

200
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,030
PETERSEN:
My pleasure, sir.

201
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:25,755
Good!

202
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,030
Pull!

203
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,195
Nice shooting, sir.

204
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,949
That's normal.

205
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:36,427
Why'd your outfit always send you
when they needed something?

206
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:38,715
I guess I'm good at it.

207
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,990
But not good enough.
You got caught.

208
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:44,949
Yes, sir, your men did catch me.
1 time out of 100.

209
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,836
You better hope your luck holds out...

210
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:52,308
...because your first assignment is to
go back to that old outfit of yours...

211
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,353
...and bring back everything you took.

212
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:58,230
- You understand me, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:14:58,436 --> 00:14:59,835
- See to it.
- Yes, sir!

214
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,191
Carry on.

215
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:02,664
MULDOON:
About face!

216
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:04,265
Forward march!

217
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,235
Sergeant?

218
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,673
That's what the man said.
Sergeant.

219
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:18,990
Sergeant.

220
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:27,349
MULDOON:
Everybody hit the deck! Up and at 'em!

221
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:30,545
Rise and shine! Up and at 'em!

222
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:33,990
Let's go! Get the lead out!

223
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:35,385
On your feet!

224
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,269
Let's go!

225
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:40,788
Come on, soldier, out of the sack!
Everybody up!

226
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:42,913
Lt's 3:30, let's go!

227
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:52,670
On your feet, soldier. On your feet.

228
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,826
Holy Toledo! Lt's only 3:30.

229
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,907
3:30? Ls that right, sarge?

230
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:00,953
That's right, soldier boy.

231
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:04,706
You better get some sleep.
We got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

232
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,950
MULDOON:
On your feet, soldier. On your feet.

233
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,271
What kind of a...?

234
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:14,552
You got 10 minutes to pack.

235
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:18,994
Pack in 10 minutes? Takes me longer
than that to get my heart started.

236
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:20,669
MULDOON:
What are you doing?

237
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:21,905
I'm packing!

238
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:26,946
You pack what Uncle Sam issued
and that's all. You got 9 minutes.

239
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,154
- Why the countdown?
- You got 8.

240
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:33,424
Where are we going?

241
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,746
MULDOON:
You'll get the word.

242
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:31,153
On the way out,
everybody grab his gear.

243
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,632
MORGAN:
Welcome to Da Nang!

244
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,633
- Hi, Mike.
- Good to see you, Frank.

245
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,229
Me too!

246
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,394
- Captain MacDaniel.
- How are you?

247
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,627
- I got the Jeep right over here.
- Fine.

248
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,390
Captain, will you see
the men get all their gear?

249
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,072
Here we go. Hop in.

250
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:05,434
- I've been on that plane for hours.
- Rather walk?

251
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,315
- I sure would.
- Good, let's stretch our legs then.

252
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:12,151
Reynolds, meet us at Colonel Cai's
office and watch that weapon.

253
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:13,590
Yes, sir!

254
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,512
I'm sure glad it's you relieving me.

255
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:30,829
- Don't hurry me. I got 3 weeks.
- I know. That was a great idea.

256
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,636
- How's your back?
- Coming along slow but sure.

257
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:36,993
Be glad when I can move around
and burn off some of this.

258
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,553
- This truck for us?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,229
That's service.

260
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,946
Okay, grab your gear.

261
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:09,634
Arthur E. Fuller. I knew that guy.

262
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,829
Named a field after him.
He won the Distinguished Service Cross.

263
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,748
Posthumously.

264
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,673
Better grab your gear.

265
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:25,632
I suppose you'll take
the long way back home.

266
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,192
Go through Hong Kong, pick up
a little yardage, some screens.

267
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,994
No, I don't think so.

268
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:35,024
My wife said not to bring anything
she couldn't either cook or play with.

269
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,915
- What's my opposite number like?
- His name's Colonel Cai.

270
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:42,235
He's a good man. Resourceful,
intelligent and has a lot of initiative.

271
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:45,229
KIRBY: Outstanding?
MORGAN: Outstanding.

272
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:54,070
- Chung See Bado. Good to see you.
- Thank you, sir.

273
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:55,874
Glad you're in the outfit.

274
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:01,229
Smart looking honor guard.
I recognize most of them.

275
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:04,309
- Even those you don't, know about you.
- How come?

276
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:06,314
MORGAN:
They got the word.

277
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,070
MORGAN:
Good afternoon.

278
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,669
Good afternoon.

279
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:20,875
Colonel Cai, Colonel Kirby.

280
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,869
- I'm happy to make your acquaintance.
- Thank you.

281
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,595
Sit down.

282
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:29,672
I have heard much about you
from Colonel Morgan and others.

283
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:34,393
If half of what I've heard is true,
I'm positive we'll work well together.

284
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:39,273
We build many camps,
clobber many V.C. Affirmative?

285
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:42,156
Affirmative.
I like the way you talk.

286
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:44,193
Let me get to the point.

287
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,312
We have two new camps.
Here and here.

288
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:51,110
This one is all right.
Everything is STRAC...

289
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:54,393
...a full complement of
Montagnards and Special Forces.

290
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:55,671
And the other one?

291
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,508
Camp A-107...

292
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,668
...code name two-niner Savoy.

293
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,272
This camp we build
in the heart of V.C. Country.

294
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:06,154
One day is nothing.

295
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:09,945
Next day we are there.
Big surprise for V.C.

296
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:14,106
Unfortunately, "A" camp 107
is only about half-finished.

297
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,315
The Viet Cong hit it with mortar fire
3 or 4 times a week.

298
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:22,913
The villagers tell us that the V.C. Are
making a big buildup across the border.

299
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,705
We're hoping that weather does not
keep us from having air support.

300
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:29,311
Without it, Charlie can
overrun the camp.

301
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:32,748
The "A" team's tour of duty
will be up in 10 days.

302
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:37,512
That puts that camp between the rock
and the hard place until it's completed.

303
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,475
I brought 2 "A" detachments with me.
I could...

304
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,911
...leave one here to form
a Mike Force...

305
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:45,431
...and take the other up
for replacements.

306
00:21:45,756 --> 00:21:47,633
I think it's a good idea.

307
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:51,869
I have to pay my respects
to the general at 1500.

308
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:54,186
- Nice to have met you.
- Likewise.

309
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,313
See you later, colonel.

310
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:07,544
KIRBY:
Hey, Provo!

311
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:10,150
- Sorry, I didn't see you.
- That's all right.

312
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:12,989
- Everyone looks at pretty girls.
- I wasn't looking at them.

313
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,306
I was thinking about that sign there.

314
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:18,389
KIRBY:
"Ln Honor of William J. Wallace."

315
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:22,033
I noticed the buildings
and streets around here...

316
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,471
...got the names of heroes on them.

317
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,195
Dead heroes.

318
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,825
It kind of sets a man to thinking.

319
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:30,634
That it does.

320
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:34,075
- And I also think we better get moving.
- Yes, sir!

321
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:56,105
You all right?

322
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:58,665
I'm still thinking
about them nameplates.

323
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,191
The ones about soldiers
killed in action.

324
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:04,792
My worry is my name don't fit
any of our buildings or streets.

325
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:08,028
You got a real worry there.
Must be tough...

326
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:09,868
...having a problem like that.

327
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:13,313
"Provo's Barracks," " Provo's
Commissary. " You see what I mean?

328
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:16,116
- No.
- It just don't sing.

329
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:19,428
If you think of something
that does sing, you let us know.

330
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,394
We'd want you to have the best.

331
00:23:21,636 --> 00:23:24,309
Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.

332
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,314
BECKWORTH:
Colonel?

333
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:55,986
Colonel? Colonel?

334
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:58,711
Remember me?

335
00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:01,113
- George...
- Beckworth.

336
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,746
This is Colonel Morgan.

337
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:07,435
I took your suggestion.
I came to see for myself.

338
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:08,585
Good for you.

339
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:11,429
They said at Group I could go,
but it'd be up to you.

340
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:14,874
- What do you think, colonel?
- Pretty hairy operation.

341
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:19,075
I don't think this area's ready
for writers. Hate to get one greased.

342
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:21,910
- Is that the real reason?
- Come again?

343
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:24,272
My paper believes
we shouldn't be in Vietnam.

344
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:27,349
Afraid l'll see something
to substantiate that belief?

345
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,395
Be my guest.

346
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:37,273
- Frank.
- Good luck, Mike.

347
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:19,067
With joyous memories,
we leave the mystical city of Da Nang!

348
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,354
What gay adventure lies ahead!

349
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:23,505
Brother...

350
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:27,464
...this trip is going to make
LSD feel like aspirin.

351
00:25:27,716 --> 00:25:28,944
Mr. Beckworth...

352
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,232
...you going to write about us?

353
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:34,434
- That's right.
- What are you going to say?

354
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:36,585
I don't know yet.

355
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,393
Man, oh, man!

356
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:05,185
Look at all those trees down there.
My dog could go crazy!

357
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:09,714
We have "A" teams out along
the Cambodian and Laotian borders.

358
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:13,631
They each built their own camp.
We're headed for one of those now...

359
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,753
...Camp A-107.

360
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:28,547
There's our destination.

361
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:55,504
- Colonel. Good to see you again.
- Captain. Thanks.

362
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,268
You know Lieutenant Sachs.

363
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:01,794
- Captain MacDaniel, your replacement.
- That's good to hear.

364
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:05,870
Sergeant Kenny, pick up
the extra gear and the mail.

365
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:09,028
If you gentlemen will follow me,
we'll get inside.

366
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:39,586
KIRBY: You got about a 150-foot
killing area here, captain.

367
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:44,826
The first thing I'd do would be
to cut that back another 300 feet.

368
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:48,432
We've been wanting to do that,
but we've been short of help.

369
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:53,033
We tried to get some engineers. They're
all busy. But I requested some Seabees.

370
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:57,792
If that detachment ever gets here,
you put them on that first thing.

371
00:29:00,476 --> 00:29:02,467
KENNY:
Mail call!

372
00:29:06,436 --> 00:29:08,825
- Dodge City?
- Yeah.

373
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,066
You can buy it cheap.

374
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:25,667
Those what they call <i>Punji</i> sticks?

375
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,635
SERGEANT: Yes, it's a little trick
we learned from Charlie.

376
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:32,633
But we don't dip them
in the same stuff he does.

377
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:45,753
You'd increase the effectiveness
of that concertina with more tanglefoot.

378
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:50,073
- Got any more of them?
- Yes, sir.

379
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:53,387
- Double the number.
- We'll get right on it.

380
00:29:59,116 --> 00:30:00,265
KIRBY:
Bring us up to date.

381
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:04,953
They mortared us again last night.
It's becoming a fairly regular thing.

382
00:30:05,196 --> 00:30:09,075
- How many operations are out?
- Three recon and 2 ambush.

383
00:30:09,316 --> 00:30:13,673
- And that counterpart of yours...
- Captain Nim. He's out with a patrol.

384
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:18,034
The one that just got zapped.
He'll be in tomorrow with 3 wounded.

385
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:21,393
- Will you be staying awhile?
- L'll be in camp, off and on.

386
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:25,185
We fixed a place for you in the commo
bunker. Not much, but it's dry.

387
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:26,755
Good.

388
00:30:27,636 --> 00:30:29,866
After mail call,
I've assigned my men...

389
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:32,676
...to get Captain MacDaniel's team
bedded down.

390
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:35,390
It's a newspaperman.

391
00:30:38,156 --> 00:30:42,547
This is Captain Coleman. Mr. Beckworth
is with the <i>Chronicle-Herald.</i>

392
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:44,866
- Can you find a spot for him?
- Affirmative.

393
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:46,105
Sergeant Kenny.

394
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,388
Take Mr. Beckworth here to my hooch.
Get him squared away.

395
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:50,785
Thank you.

396
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,315
This way, Mr. Beckworth.

397
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:54,909
Can I give you a hand?

398
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:03,230
If it's all right,
we'll stay with the team.

399
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:04,545
Fine.

400
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,509
This way, sir.

401
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:22,348
The captain has the bottom bunk. We'll
get somebody to make this one for you.

402
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:25,794
- Is there drinking water?
- I don't know if it's cold.

403
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:27,754
It'll be fine, thank you.

404
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:42,673
HOBSON: You've got a pad in the storage
bunker. You can have mine in a few days.

405
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,952
I hope. To the right here.

406
00:31:47,756 --> 00:31:49,155
You funny!

407
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,788
You've made Hamchunk's "A" Club.

408
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:56,229
You funny!

409
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:58,829
You not.

410
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:03,151
This is Hamchunk.

411
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:09,668
He's become a permanent fixture here.
He's an orphan.

412
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:13,787
Lived with some missionaries
about 10 clicks south of here...

413
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:17,711
...till they were assassinated.
Maybe you could use an interpreter.

414
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:21,073
- Missionaries taught him English.
- I don't want an interpreter.

415
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,272
You number one. I choose you.

416
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:26,152
I don't want to be chosen.

417
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:30,384
- I don't think you have much choice.
- Choice, Mr. Hobson?

418
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:34,151
I haven't had a choice
since I was selected for this...

419
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:35,545
...outfit.

420
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,308
You get used to me.

421
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,188
You funny.

422
00:32:39,516 --> 00:32:41,632
- You...
- In here.

423
00:32:51,516 --> 00:32:53,905
What's the status
of your crew-served weapons?

424
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:57,273
We have two 81 s, four 60s...

425
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:00,747
...twelve .30 calibers,
three on each wall.

426
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:05,308
One 4-deuce. Besides crew-served,
we have six M-79's.

427
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,228
No .50 calibers?

428
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:10,946
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok
for the smell of a .50.

429
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,953
KIRBY: You hear that, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

430
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,027
- Know where there are any .50's?
MULDOON: No, sir.

431
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:19,075
Neither do I.
You better tell Sergeant Petersen.

432
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:22,547
I almost forgot. Captain MacDaniel
needs corrugated tin.

433
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:25,151
- It's been hard to come by lately.
- Sergeant.

434
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:29,987
Yes, sir. I know.
"Tell Petersen. Tell the scrounger."

435
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,235
Petersen!

436
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:37,905
What happens if Charlie hits this camp
before you get it completed?

437
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,350
If he does, and he's too strong
for us to handle...

438
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:47,147
...we have 3 LZs within 4 clicks to
send 10 choppers each to reinforce us.

439
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:51,312
One is by that shale cliff
you saw on your way in.

440
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:54,229
And the second is to the west of here...

441
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:58,264
...near a deserted Montagnard village
where some of these people used to live.

442
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:02,509
The third is to the north,
near an old bridge.

443
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:05,233
What if Charlie overruns the camp?

444
00:34:06,516 --> 00:34:07,949
In that case, sir...

445
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:11,108
...the camp is prepared
to escape and evade on order...

446
00:34:11,356 --> 00:34:13,711
...through places
in the wire and mines...

447
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:16,345
...only "A" Team
and Captain Nim know about.

448
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:19,026
- My compliments.
- Thank you, sir.

449
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:25,866
Commander of this area
runs everything by the book.

450
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:28,471
And I am with him to the nth degree.

451
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:32,186
And every piece of this equipment
will be painted.

452
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:36,105
And every piece of this equipment
will be numbered.

453
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:37,749
And every...

454
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:43,347
What in the hell is that?

455
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,870
BECKWORTH: You make good coffee.
- Cholong coffee.

456
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:13,150
AMA: More coffee, sergeant?
MULDOON: No, thanks.

457
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:15,785
GRIFFIN:
Brother!

458
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:19,265
Boy, is it miserable out there!

459
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:23,907
And believe me, it's sure in hell
stay-awake weather.

460
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:25,988
Don't you men have rain gear?

461
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:29,832
Yeah, but it doesn't
do any good in this lousy climate.

462
00:35:43,756 --> 00:35:47,669
COLLIER:
Skipper! Savoy 3 is on the horn, sir.

463
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,587
Savoy 3 to Savoy 6.

464
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:54,986
NIM [OVER RADIO]:
<i>This is Savoy 3.</i>

465
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,704
<i>I'm nearing home base.
I've thrown smoke.</i>

466
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,628
<i>Can you identify?</i>

467
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:01,594
COLEMAN:
I see the red smoke.

468
00:36:02,316 --> 00:36:03,829
Come on in.

469
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:05,231
Out.

470
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,628
COLEMAN:
Give them a hand.

471
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,356
- Morning, Max, Collier.
- Morning, sir.

472
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:19,266
- Hell of a mess!
- Looks like we'll float away.

473
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,713
What's this outfit coming in?

474
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:24,756
COLEMAN: That's Captain Nim,
your counterpart...

475
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:27,744
...with a patrol that just got zapped.

476
00:36:28,196 --> 00:36:29,595
- Joe.
- Yes, sir.

477
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:33,505
Alert the dispensary.
Tell them casualties are coming in.

478
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,665
L'll go find Colonel Kirby.

479
00:37:09,316 --> 00:37:10,908
It was a close one.

480
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:15,390
LIEUTENANT: Get those casualties over
to the dispensary. Let's go. Snap it up!

481
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:17,785
The rest of you...

482
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:22,553
...get some dry clothes and chow.
Report for debriefing.

483
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:24,825
Move it out!

484
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,429
Fill me in.

485
00:37:26,676 --> 00:37:28,985
As you know,
we were hit yesterday.

486
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:30,828
Three casualties.

487
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,584
This is sure Charlie's weather!

488
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:35,867
But they didn't follow us.

489
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:38,232
- You sure?
- Affirmative.

490
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:43,785
Skipper, I would like
to look after my casualties.

491
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:46,152
Sure. Come on.

492
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:02,871
KIRBY: What's the situation?
COLEMAN: He's all right.

493
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:04,833
MEDIC:
More painful than serious, sir.

494
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:08,591
Colonel, I want you to meet
the camp commander.

495
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,712
- Oh!
- Dai Uy Nim.

496
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:12,787
KIRBY:
Stay where you are, Dai Uy.

497
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,145
Tran Nim.

498
00:38:14,396 --> 00:38:17,354
I've read your name on many reports.
You're very active.

499
00:38:17,636 --> 00:38:19,467
We try, sir.

500
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:22,595
Meet your new
counterpart, Captain MacDaniel.

501
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:26,506
Welcome. We will have a good post
here when it is finished.

502
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,149
MacDANIEL:
I've no doubt, Dai Uy.

503
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,353
Your outfit looks pretty beat up.

504
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:35,395
- Eleven days is a long patrol.
- We're short of men.

505
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:39,113
We've got everything we need
except strikers.

506
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:41,074
What seems to be the trouble?

507
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:46,151
The natives have been so exploited,
they won't trust anyone with a gun.

508
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:50,395
Same old story. How many villages
are there in the vicinity?

509
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:53,628
We've got 7.
There were 5.

510
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,673
And we've got 2 in camp.

511
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:59,633
If you got all the villagers in,
what would that do for you?

512
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:02,026
That'd give us 300-500.

513
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,511
Better get on the Psy War about this.

514
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:05,950
NIM:
When you leave, Dai Uy?

515
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:08,551
Tomorrow. Hopefully.

516
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:11,874
Da Nang, Nha Trang,
Saigon and home!

517
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:15,826
My home is in Hanoi.

518
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:17,915
I go home too someday.

519
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:19,755
You see.

520
00:39:20,796 --> 00:39:24,186
First, kill all stinking Cong.

521
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:26,390
Then go home.

522
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:31,635
Will there be anything else?

523
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,104
That's all, Nim.

524
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:35,630
NIM:
Thank you, sir.

525
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,792
He sounds like he means it.

526
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:45,073
He keeps score
on the wall of his hooch.

527
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:48,189
He personally greased 52 this year.

528
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:49,710
Says he'll double it...

529
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:53,830
...if all the 'Yards will get out of his
way and give him a clear field of fire.

530
00:39:55,516 --> 00:39:59,714
I noticed a load of corrugated tin's
miraculously appeared overnight.

531
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:01,907
Sergeant Petersen provided it.

532
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:03,788
A good man you got there.

533
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,992
Sergeant Petersen say where he got it?

534
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:08,591
He said the good fairy left it.

535
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:12,306
I hope he said,
"The good fairy left it, sir!"

536
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:15,315
Captain, will you join us
in the commo bunker?

537
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:26,473
MacDANIEL: Good evening, colonel.
KIRBY: Relax. Sit down.

538
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:31,750
- My, it's a beautiful evening.
MacDANIEL: That it is.

539
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,190
MULDOON:

Thank you.

541
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:40,626
This would be great country...

542
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:42,989
...if it weren't for the war.

543
00:40:43,436 --> 00:40:45,267
And the damn monsoons.

544
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,673
Give me a beer, Petersen.

545
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,827
You won it all.

546
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:07,633
PARKS: Mr. Petersen?
- Yeah.

547
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:09,508
Why ain't you in this game?

548
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:12,594
Mr. Beckworth showed him 3 aces.

549
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:21,631
Be sure and check the guard roster
before you turn in.

550
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,064
MEN:
Yes, sir.

551
00:41:23,636 --> 00:41:25,592
- Good night.
MEN: Good night, sir.

552
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,425
Where's McGee?

553
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,513
Doc, you got the 4-to-6 watch.

554
00:41:36,796 --> 00:41:38,673
Delightful. Thank you.

555
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,785
Jim Beam!
You're not feeding him that stuff?

556
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:43,515
You sure it's good for him?

557
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:45,508
You questioning...

558
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:48,232
...my professional competence?

559
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:50,194
He sure looks bad.

560
00:41:50,436 --> 00:41:52,108
He's dying, poor old thing.

561
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:55,154
- Can't even eat anymore.
- What seems to be wrong?

562
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:59,514
I'm not the best doctor in the world,
but I'm the best one without a license.

563
00:41:59,756 --> 00:42:03,829
My diagnosis is plague,
tuberculosis, old age...

564
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:05,429
...and no hope.

565
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,234
He's tired.

566
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:08,989
Bone tired.

567
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,068
SOLDIER:
The captain's in there!

568
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,593
Check the damage in the dispensary!

569
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:37,875
Everything's all right here, colonel!
A near miss, but nobody hurt.

570
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,630
- I think they've stopped.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:44,874
This is the usual procedure.

572
00:42:45,116 --> 00:42:47,949
About every other night.
Harassment.

573
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:51,348
It's pretty good shooting.

574
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:55,111
Commo bunker,
the dispensary, the team house.

575
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,393
It's a sure thing that they
have eyes inside our camp.

576
00:43:01,756 --> 00:43:03,792
MacDANIEL: Check your gear.
Commo bunker was hit.

577
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:07,346

MacDANIEL:

580
00:43:11,196 --> 00:43:12,868
Lt's the captain, sir.

581
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:15,148
Better...

582
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:16,630
...move him out of there.

583
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:20,151
Colonel Kirby!

584
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:22,989
KIRBY:
Yo! Be right there.

585
00:43:45,196 --> 00:43:48,393
He was going to go home
tomorrow, wasn't he, sir?

586
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:52,874
All the way.

587
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:16,312
PILOT: What do we got, 10 pounders?
GREEN: 10-pound warheads, sir.

588
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:22,155
MULDOON: Ready to go hunting?
PILOT: Be a couple of minutes yet.

589
00:44:26,636 --> 00:44:29,389
We'll be gone about 3 hours.
Mind the store.

590
00:44:29,756 --> 00:44:30,745
Don't worry.

591
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:33,384
SAVO Y 8 [OVER RADIO]:
<i>Two-niner Savoy.</i>

592
00:44:33,556 --> 00:44:35,706

00:44:36,116 --> 00:44:38,789
Savoy 8, this is Savoy 5. Over.

594
00:44:39,036 --> 00:44:41,186
<i>This is Savoy 8. I'm nearing the camp.</i>

595
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:44,633
<i>Have thrown smoke. Identify.</i>

596
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:46,434
Savoy 8, this is Savoy 5.

597
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:48,514
I see green smoke.

598
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,348
Come on in. Out.

599
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:54,267
We better get out of the way.

600
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:14,630
Those choppers are very important
out here, aren't they?

601
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:17,151
Couldn't win this war without them.

602
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:21,545
Captain.

603
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:26,070
I'm sort of new out here.
What's this all about?

604
00:45:28,036 --> 00:45:30,470
Muldoon and MacDaniel,
in those choppers...

605
00:45:30,716 --> 00:45:35,028
...fly low over the treetops
and hope to draw V.C. Gunfire.

606
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:43,156
You mean there are V.C. That close?

607
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:45,471
Yes.

608

building a boat bridge.

611
00:46:20,596 --> 00:46:23,030
MacDANIEL: They're not Cong,
they're hard-core regulars.

612
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,305

613
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:43,791
...you worry me.

614
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:47,315
Three tours of duty and you're
still acting like a civilian.

615
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:50,665
Sergeant Muldoon, I'm not a Marine.

616
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,872
I believe in my comfort.

617
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:57,384
We got the tin.

618
00:47:57,796 --> 00:47:59,229
What about the .50 caliber?

619
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:01,473
Don't worry. Next drop.

620
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:03,265
How'd you do it?

621
00:48:03,476 --> 00:48:05,751
A guy in Khe Sahn
wanted 2 cases of bourbon.

622
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:08,669
Bourbon! How'd you get
2 cases of bourbon?

623
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:10,747
From a straight leg
in supply in Bien Hoa.

624
00:48:11,116 --> 00:48:12,515
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

625
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:15,506
Why would he give you
that much booze?

626
00:48:15,756 --> 00:48:18,589
He didn't give it to me.
I traded him for it.

627
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:20,591
Traded him what?

628
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:23,873
I traded him a Montagnard crossbow...

629
00:48:24,116 --> 00:48:26,835
...a number one address
on Chu Do Street...

630
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:28,748
...and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals.

631
00:48:28,996 --> 00:48:31,829
And where did you get
a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals?

632
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:33,945
I made them.

633
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:38,589

I've gone to church.

634
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:40,554
I was a Boy Scout.

00:50:02,996 --> 00:50:06,113
We'd have come sooner, but the
Marines wanted a strip up north.

646
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:09,666
It's going to get a little hairy
around here, Lieutenant...

late or not.

- Could you move that jungle back for us?

00:50:34,996 --> 00:50:37,271
Just say the word,
and l'll move it to China.

652
00:50:37,516 --> 00:50:40,633
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.

653
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,634
- Will do, sir.
- Watson!

654
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:44,434

655
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:46,746
- Thirteen.
- Lucky number.

656
00:50:46,996 --> 00:50:48,190
Thirteen. Hop to it!

657
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:51,473
- I'd like to run an equipment check.
- Go ahead.

00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:43,270
He was pacing off the distance
between the wall and the team house.

00:52:43,516 --> 00:52:45,313
We could've caught a round tonight.

667

I certainly hope you can
prove that, sergeant.

01:29:53,589 --> 01:29:55,705
He's pretty bad, sir, but still alive.

1025
01:29:56,589 --> 01:29:58,705
See if that .50's operational.

1026
01:29:58,949 --> 01:30:00,382
L'll check it.

1027
01:30:02,309 --> 01:30:04,459
Beldo, give me a hand!

1028
01:30:26,109 --> 01:30:27,224
KIRBY:
Fall back!

1029
01:30:58,269 --> 01:31:00,499
KIRBY:
Swing her around 180 degrees.

1030
01:31:00,749 --> 01:31:03,627
Give them 4 H.E.
Maximum elevation...

1031
01:31:03,869 --> 01:31:06,258
...and destroy the tube. Fall back!

1032
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,140
KIRBY:
Move them out!

1033
01:31:23,509 --> 01:31:25,227
MOORE:
Choppers are on their way.

1034
01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:29,588
SOLDIER:
Keep your heads down!

1035
01:31:32,469 --> 01:31:35,506
- What about the radio?
- Charges are set and it's ready to go.

1036
01:31:35,749 --> 01:31:38,309
- Claymores?
- We got a few spread out.

1037
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:40,341
KIRBY:
Move out!

1038
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:43,738
SOLDIERS:
Let's go! Keep it down. Let's move.

1039
01:31:55,789 --> 01:31:56,778
KIRBY:
Everybody...

1040
01:31:57,029 --> 01:31:58,348
...fall back!

1041
01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:05,024
MULDOON:
Choppers are here. Hurry it up!

1042
01:32:05,709 --> 01:32:07,540
SOLDIER:
Head to the landing zone!

1043
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:13,702
MOORE: Everyone out to LZ green.
KIRBY: Fall back!

1044
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,024
SOLDIER:
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1045
01:32:36,189 --> 01:32:37,781
- Hi, Tom.
- How you doing, Pete?

1046
01:32:38,029 --> 01:32:41,066
Take care of that kid,
no matter what happens.

1047
01:32:41,549 --> 01:32:42,948
Will do, Pete.

1048
01:32:54,989 --> 01:32:56,547
[V.C. CHEERING]

1049
01:33:20,069 --> 01:33:21,297
What happened to Nim?

1050
01:33:21,549 --> 01:33:25,508
He bought the farm, sir,
but he took a lot of them with him.

1051
01:33:36,789 --> 01:33:37,824
COSTA:
Colonel Kirby.

1052
01:33:37,989 --> 01:33:40,264
Puff the Magic Dragon's on the horn.

1053
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:44,628
This is Two-Niner Savoy. Over.

1054
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:46,825
Puff to ground,
where do you want it?

1055
01:33:47,069 --> 01:33:50,459
Put it on the camp.
Those people have it, we don't.

1056
01:33:50,949 --> 01:33:52,428
It'll only take a minute.

1057
01:34:18,549 --> 01:34:20,904
I think Puff broke their back.

1058
01:34:21,149 --> 01:34:24,061
We can probably move
in there tomorrow...

1059
01:34:24,309 --> 01:34:27,426
...God willing
and the river don't rise.

1060
01:35:07,429 --> 01:35:09,101
MacDANIEL:
What do we do now, sir?

1061
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:13,663
First we get some sack time.

1062
01:35:15,789 --> 01:35:18,303
Then we start all over again.

1063
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:20,621
- Muldoon.
- Sir?

1064
01:35:20,829 --> 01:35:24,265
Check the perimeter. Make sure
the outposts are set for the night.

1065
01:35:52,029 --> 01:35:54,145
I guess it couldn't
have been much worse.

1066
01:35:55,309 --> 01:35:56,788
We're still alive.

1067
01:35:59,309 --> 01:36:01,027
What happens now?

1068
01:36:02,629 --> 01:36:04,779
We keep doing our jobs.

1069
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:08,183
You got one to go back to,
haven't you?

1070
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:10,828
I guess so.

1071
01:36:12,029 --> 01:36:14,702
What are you going to say
in your newspaper?

1072
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:18,984
If I say what I feel,
I may be out of a job.

1073
01:36:20,789 --> 01:36:22,222
We'll always give you one.

1074
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:25,507
I could do you more good
with a typewriter.

1075
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:29,979
It's Sergeant Sooby's.

1076
01:36:30,589 --> 01:36:32,102
He didn't make it.

1077
01:36:32,789 --> 01:36:34,063
Funny thing.

1078
01:36:34,749 --> 01:36:37,786
Fellow takes one of these into battle...

1079
01:36:38,349 --> 01:36:42,501
...and by the grace of God
he comes out in one piece...

1080
01:36:43,789 --> 01:36:47,225
...he carries a strange sense of guilt
all the rest of his life.

1081
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:48,982
JAMISON:
Colonel?

1082
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:53,184
I'd like permission to take my men
into "A" camp to check our equipment.

1083
01:36:53,429 --> 01:36:57,422
And also, that sergeant who was pretty
badly hit was asking for you. Provo?

1084
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:59,028
Thank you.

1085
01:37:01,109 --> 01:37:04,419
Captain Johanson
is taking the Mike Force...

1086
01:37:04,669 --> 01:37:07,547
...back this afternoon.
You can go in with him.

1087
01:37:08,029 --> 01:37:11,180
- Happy to have had you aboard.
- Thanks for the ride.

1088
01:37:28,869 --> 01:37:30,541
Why wasn't he on the chopper?

1089
01:37:30,789 --> 01:37:33,542
The wounded go before the dead.

1090
01:37:35,269 --> 01:37:37,066
We thought we'd better
not move him.

1091
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:39,823
They zapped me good.

1092
01:37:40,509 --> 01:37:42,147
You're not gone yet.

1093
01:37:43,069 --> 01:37:44,741
Would you do me a favor, sir?

1094
01:37:47,189 --> 01:37:49,464
Would you take a touch with me?

1095
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:53,983
I sure will.

1096
01:38:10,829 --> 01:38:12,057
Thank you, sir.

1097
01:38:14,509 --> 01:38:16,739
Another favor, sir?

1098
01:38:16,989 --> 01:38:17,978
What is it?

1099
01:38:18,949 --> 01:38:23,340
You remember the decision I was
trying to make, about my name?

1100
01:38:23,629 --> 01:38:24,664
KIRBY:
The signs?

1101
01:38:25,829 --> 01:38:27,103
I remember.

1102
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:51,742
That's it.

1103
01:39:06,189 --> 01:39:07,827
There it is, sir.

1104
01:39:08,749 --> 01:39:10,387
You're sure that's what he wanted?

1105
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:14,747
Affirmative. That's what he wanted
and that's what he's going to get!

1106
01:39:17,429 --> 01:39:22,025
Maybe he liked the idea of having
so many men think about him every day.

1107
01:39:22,269 --> 01:39:23,418
Besides...

1108
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:24,937
...it sings.

1109
01:39:26,749 --> 01:39:28,341
It sings?

1110
01:39:29,429 --> 01:39:30,987
That's what he said.

1111
01:39:31,509 --> 01:39:32,828
It sings.

1112
01:39:35,349 --> 01:39:37,817
ROBIN:
Provo's Privy. It does sing!

1113
01:39:42,429 --> 01:39:46,547
Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were
going to tell you about a plan we had...

1114
01:39:46,789 --> 01:39:48,666
...and "A" camp 107 got hit.

1115
01:39:49,189 --> 01:39:52,147
This can't wait till you take over.
I want you briefed.

1116
01:39:52,389 --> 01:39:54,857
- Why way out here?
- This is top secret.

1117
01:39:55,309 --> 01:39:57,539
I repeat, top secret.

1118
01:40:02,309 --> 01:40:03,537
KIRBY:
Colonel Cai.

1119
01:40:05,389 --> 01:40:07,300
- How was Saigon?
- Very interesting.

1120
01:40:07,549 --> 01:40:09,744
I attended a meeting
with the premier and his staff.

1121
01:40:10,069 --> 01:40:13,186
The main subject
was General Pham Son Ti.

1122
01:40:13,389 --> 01:40:17,223
He has assumed command of the
entire Viet Cong forces in the south.

1123
01:40:17,589 --> 01:40:19,307
Which makes him Number One!

1124
01:40:19,549 --> 01:40:22,188
Affirmative.
And it could mean a major offensive.

1125
01:40:22,429 --> 01:40:25,307
I had my hands on him
the last time I was out here.

1126
01:40:25,549 --> 01:40:29,701
But because of political pressure,
I had to turn him loose.

1127
01:40:30,229 --> 01:40:32,106
Like to get your hands on him again?

1128
01:40:32,349 --> 01:40:36,900
Who wouldn't? But if I know General Ti,
he's surrounded by a regiment.

1129
01:40:37,149 --> 01:40:40,221
- My people think several.
- That brings us up to the plan.

1130
01:40:40,709 --> 01:40:42,381
He's somewhere
in Hang Phau Valley.

1131
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:45,223
Surrounded by the regiments
you mentioned, which makes...

1132
01:40:45,589 --> 01:40:47,227
...a capture impossible.

1133
01:40:47,469 --> 01:40:49,824
Precisely.
Except for one woman...

1134
01:40:50,349 --> 01:40:52,817
...and a certain hand-picked team.

1135
01:40:54,229 --> 01:40:55,947
Go on, colonel.

1136
01:40:58,229 --> 01:40:59,378
This is the rat.

1137
01:41:02,509 --> 01:41:04,181
And this is the trap.

1138
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:10,504
My father was a simple man.

1139
01:41:11,389 --> 01:41:13,619
All he wanted was to be free...

1140
01:41:14,589 --> 01:41:18,138
...his wife to love,
and his children to raise.

1141
01:41:18,389 --> 01:41:22,382
He tried to remain neutral.
That was his mistake.

1142
01:41:23,749 --> 01:41:26,309
What he didn't realize...

1143
01:41:26,549 --> 01:41:29,347
...was that man has to pay a price
for that freedom.

1144
01:41:30,869 --> 01:41:33,941
Therefore, he suffered
the ultimate penalty.

1145
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:37,945
Since that day...

1146
01:41:38,749 --> 01:41:41,183
...I've lived but with one thought:

1147
01:41:41,749 --> 01:41:44,866
To find the man who ordered
my father and little brother murdered.

1148
01:41:47,349 --> 01:41:48,668
I found him.

1149
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:52,184
His name is Pham Son Ti.

1150
01:41:53,549 --> 01:41:55,585
And I will give him to you.

1151
01:41:56,469 --> 01:41:57,458
When?

1152
01:41:57,909 --> 01:42:01,504
One week from tonight,
at the old Costeau Plantation.

1153
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,144
Colonel Cai knows where it is.

1154
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:23,669
How much do you know about this girl?

1155
01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:27,106
Her father and General Ti's father
grew up together.

1156
01:42:27,349 --> 01:42:29,624
Their families were very close.

1157
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:32,303
Even before he moved to Hanoi...

1158
01:42:32,549 --> 01:42:35,143
...he had more
than a friendly interest in Lin.

1159
01:42:35,389 --> 01:42:36,742
Do you trust her?

1160
01:42:36,989 --> 01:42:38,547
Of course.

1161
01:42:40,109 --> 01:42:42,145
She's my brother's wife.

1162
01:43:05,749 --> 01:43:09,867
Let's see, it's 0400.
That means we'll hit the drop zone...

1163
01:43:10,109 --> 01:43:13,340
...around a little after sunrise.

1164
01:43:13,949 --> 01:43:14,938
Everything set?

1165
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,623
Your gear's on board
with Colonel Cai's.

1166
01:43:17,869 --> 01:43:19,700
KIRBY:
Thank you. Let's get aboard.

1167
01:43:19,949 --> 01:43:23,339
MULDOON: You heard the man.
Stick formation. Let's go.

1168
01:43:24,669 --> 01:43:26,785
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry.

1169
01:43:27,429 --> 01:43:30,182
Colonel Cai, you haven't
said a word all night.

1170
01:43:30,429 --> 01:43:33,626
You know why?
He's never jumped before.

1171
01:43:33,869 --> 01:43:35,348
First one's easy.

1172
01:43:35,589 --> 01:43:38,547
It's the second one
that's hard to get them to make.

1173
01:43:40,229 --> 01:43:41,628
Colonel?

1174
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:05,099
MULDOON:
We'll use the alternative plan Bravo?

1175
01:44:05,349 --> 01:44:06,543
KIRBY:
Right.

1176
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:08,901
MULDOON:
Alternative plan Bravo!

1177
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:10,980
Kowalski, that means you take point.

1178
01:44:11,229 --> 01:44:13,743
If you see anything,
don't let them spot you. Freeze!

1179
01:44:14,029 --> 01:44:16,748
- Let us know. Got it?
- Got it.

1180
01:44:24,069 --> 01:44:25,422
One minute to drop, sir.

1181
01:44:40,429 --> 01:44:43,068
The recon was a success.

1182
01:44:43,389 --> 01:44:47,018
Probably be no trouble.
But the word is alert!

1183
01:44:47,789 --> 01:44:48,904
Get ready.

1184
01:44:50,749 --> 01:44:51,898
Port side...

1185
01:44:52,149 --> 01:44:53,741
...stand up.

1186
01:45:00,629 --> 01:45:02,779
Starboard side, stand up.

1187
01:45:06,389 --> 01:45:07,708
Hook up.

1188
01:45:10,349 --> 01:45:11,941
Stand in the door.

1189
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:23,024
Go!

1190
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:27,298
Go!

1191
01:45:39,949 --> 01:45:40,984
You ready?

1192
01:46:03,229 --> 01:46:06,346
Kowalski's got about
a 5 minute start on us.

1193
01:46:06,589 --> 01:46:08,944
WATSON: Lieutenant Moore sprained
