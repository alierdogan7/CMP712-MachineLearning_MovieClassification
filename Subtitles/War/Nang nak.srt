1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,720
The 18th of August, 1868

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,870
On the First of the Waning Moon,
the ninth month

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,710
I have to go, Nak...

4
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,231
Mak...

5
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,037
Mak...

6
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,152
Mak...

7
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,076
Mak...

8
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,992
Mak...

9
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,151
Mak...

10
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,357
Mak...

11
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,278
Mak...

12
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,080
Nak's ghostly spirit is said
to be a true story,

13
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,356
long told over generations.

14
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,160
The legend has it that Nang Nak,
local to Prakanong District

15
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,360
was a true and perfect wife,
highly loyeal to her husband.

16
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,280
Even death could not mortalize her love
and loyalty.

17
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,320
Her loving soul wandered,

18
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,553
awaiting for her husband
to return to living together.

19
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,715
Nang Nak

20
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:37,953
Mak... help me...

21
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,233
Prig.

22
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,553
Prig.

23
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,953
Prig.

24
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,833
Prig.

25
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,071
Prig.

26
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,672
Prig.

27
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,558
Prig.

28
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,400
Prig.

29
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,915
Prig.

30
00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:01,071
Somebody! Help!
Someone hurt here! Help!

31
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,240
Prig.

32
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,473
Prig.

33
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,629
Prig.

34
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,073
Mak!

35
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:08,916
Nak... Nak... Nak...

36
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,920
How ill is he? Please tell me.

37
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,797
I need to know.

38
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,400
His condition is quite serious.

39
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,872
But don't worry.
His fortune still reads strongly.

40
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,116
That's relief.

41
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,989
But his illness worries me still.

42
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Can you lessen his bad luck?
For pity's sake.

43
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,120
Prepare offerings for the monk.

44
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,275
I'll make merits to redeem him
from his karma.

45
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,360
Keep this charm strip and hold sacred.

46
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,400
It protects you and the baby
from the evil spirits.

47
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,551
How long have you been pregnant?

48
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,837
Almost 4 months.

49
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,515
I do pity you, Nak.

50
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,396
Nak.

51
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:55,117
Help!

52
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,239
Help!

53
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,872
He's in pretty bad shape.

54
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,320
Maybe too late.

55
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,997
I'm afraid he's dying.
Only the High Dignitary can help.

56
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,232
We must wait for him then.

57
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,390
I'd better go.

58
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,998
Nak.

59
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,119
Nak.

60
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,316
Mak.

61
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,436
Prig.

62
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,920
Yuan! Press carefully. Bitch!

63
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,040
Yuan! How's she doing?

64
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,393
Don't move.

65
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,030
Nak. Take it easy.

66
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,751
Set the fire.

67
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,590
Push! Push! Again!

68
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,510
Don't stand block.
She's having her hard time already.

69
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,557
That's bad omen, you know.

70
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,435
Since when has he been here?

71
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,272
Yesterday evening, Your dignitary.

72
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,592
The doctor at Ta Tien sent him here.

73
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,637
Seriously ill he is.

74
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,433
Hurry up!

75
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,600
Prakhunnan... Satu.

76
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,234
Have some.
Water helps laboring easier.

77
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,636
Um, are you stupid?
Open the window, you fool.

78
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,149
Widows must be open in laboring.

79
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,640
Easy... easy. Why is it so hard this time?

80
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,676
I may have it cut.

81
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
Nak...

82
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,993
Hang on. It's going to be hurt.

83
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,957
Mak!

84
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,120
How is he, Novice? Is he better yet?

85
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
Yes, Your Dignitary.
But his condition maintains.

86
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,672
Good.

87
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,836
Mak... Mak...

88
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,400
Novice. How can I help you?

89
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,440
The High Dignitary has sent for you.
He's at his monastery house.

90
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,192
Alright.

91
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
How are you feeling?

92
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,120
You look all well. Are you feeling well?

93
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,634
I am, Your Dignitary.

94
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,720
Because of you and your kindness.

95
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,473
So I survive.

96
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,440
Fate is very strange.

97
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,600
Some look to be dying, but they aren't.

98
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,559
Some don't have a sign,
but die in a sudden.

99
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,351
So they say what's certain is uncertain.

100
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,960
Now that you are well,
I suggest you enter ordination.

101
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,078
That will ease your bad fortune.

102
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,431
What do you think?

103
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,960
You must be worried about
your family, aren't you?

104
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes, Your Dignitary.
My wife at Prakanong Canal is pregnant.

105
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,760
She must have given birth by now.

106
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,400
I so wonder how they are.

107
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
That got me worried
so I think I should leave.

108
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,640
I'll certainly be back to ordain later on.

109
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,600
As you please.

110
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,400
From now on,
whatever may happen, be calm.

111
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
And be aware
that everything goes by way of karma.

112
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,758
Never set yourself on attachment.
It only brings you sufferings.

113
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,279
Nak...

114
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,559
Mak...

115
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,440
Nak... I'm home.

116
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,953
Mak...

117
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,360
You look very thin.

118
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,480
Didn't the army feed you well at all?

119
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,436
Basically, just chilies and salt.

120
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,320
Sometimes, they even sent no provisions.

121
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,710
Only sweet potatoes
and yam kept us alive.

122
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,230
It was extremely hard, Dear.

123
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,514
Mountains and forests were barren.

124
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:54,040
Many soldiers died of Malaria
and cholera.

125
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,191
What about yourself?

126
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,074
I almost died from a deep wound cut
at the chest.

127
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
It took me full bedrest for months.

128
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,555
Luckily, the High Dignitary
of Rakang Temple saved by life.

129
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,230
I could have died, otherwise.

130
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,040
But Prig! Poor him!
He was too young to die.

131
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,998
What? Is Prig dead?

132
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,879
Yes. He was close to beheaded

133
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,510
and died right before my eyes.

134
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,716
The body was cremated like
a no one's son.

135
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,359
Very pitiful.

136
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,313
Oh! I almost forgot.

137
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
His wife, Pad, doesn't know this.

138
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,915
I must go to tell her.

139
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,671
Are you going now?

140
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,877
Yes.

141
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,840
You came back just now
and must be tired.

142
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,628
Rest for a day, would you?
I'll go tell Pad for you.

143
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,080
Our baby is so young.

144
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,356
Why are you taking it with?

145
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,072
It can't be without.
Our baby is such a mom's child.

146
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,594
He's never been away from me.

147
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,393
I want the one you are chewing.

148
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,272
No. No...

149
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,472
Naughty man! Don't...

150
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,393
It is very sweet... Nak...

151
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:49,480
Shame on you!

152
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,520
How are you kissing in the field?

153
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,680
Does your breath smell there?

154
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
Nak is running away. Follow her.

155
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,880
Son of Bitches!
How dare you peeking on us?

156
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,000
If I can't get blood out of
your heads today,

157
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,309
don't call me a man.

158
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,911
Come! Come on! Think I were Nak.

159
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,960
If you are real men, don't run away.

160
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,839
Let me get your heads bleeding some.

161
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,074
Um! Prig! Where are you?

162
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,755
Mak... Help!

163
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,111
Prig...

164
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,431
Prig, don't die. Prig...

165
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,240
Mak...

166
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,150
Urb...

167
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,438
Urb... Are you here?

168
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,118
It's me! Mak!

169
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,400
Nak! You scared me.

170
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,755
When were you here?
I didn't hear you came.

171
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,280
I came back home but you weren't there.

172
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,158
I looked all over for you.

173
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,080
I'm afraid you'd leave me again.

174
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,760
Nak. Why are you saying so?

175
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,400
I never think like that.

176
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,320
I just came out to get some palm leaves.

177
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,073
I'll make some toys for our baby Dang.

178
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,759
Let's go home.

179
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,031
Um! Where are you going?

180
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,754
What's the matter? That's quite a shout.

181
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,040
It was Um. How dumb he is!

182
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,800
He didn't hear me shout.

183
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
He paddled his boat so fast.

184
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,040
Be ashamed!

185
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,360
What? What were you saying?

186
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,600
Shame on you!

187
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,960
Aren't you embarrassed,
standing naked there?

188
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,475
I was glad, meeting with Um.

189
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:42,914
He might think it
were some ghosts or what.

190
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,397
Mak.

191
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,035
Rest in Heaven, nak.

192
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,000
Father!

193
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,480
Yesterday I went fishing and met Mak.

194
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,313
He must be living with Nak.

195
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,793
The Hell with him!

196
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,316
Did he know yet?

197
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,238
Urb! Urb!

198
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,598
It's me. Mak.

199
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I know she's been dead for 3 days.

200
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,868
You didn't tell me.

201
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,517
She died on the day you were back.

202
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,113
I was so happy that I forgot telling.

203
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,749
What became of her?

204
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,954
Why is her body left unattended like that?

205
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Before you were back,
people died of cholera.

206
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,240
So did she.

207
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,314
She was sick for 2 days and died.

208
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:42,434
So people in the neighbor moved away.

209
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,680
I was afraid, too.

210
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,196
But Dang was young
and might get infected easily.

211
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,349
So I had to leave her like that.

212
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,559
Don't you go to her house again.

213
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,590
I don't want you to get the cholera.

214
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,028
Nak... You scare me... Nak...

215
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,711
Here's yours. Take it back.

216
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:41,831
Oh, the pleasure boat.

217
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:54,188
So large in measures

218
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:03,758
Anchored at the peer

219
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:14,993
Loaded with passengers

220
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,635
Don't cry. She's coming!

221
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,553
Nak.

222
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,151
Nak, I looked all over for you.
Here you are, pounding rice.

223
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,597
What are you up for? It's late.
Go to bed.

224
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,231
What about you,
pounding rice during these hours?

225
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,278
Why don't you wait until the morning?

226
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,392
We are running out of rice.

227
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,513
I'm afraid it may not be enough
for your breakfast.

228
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:34,349
My Dear! Why didn't you tell me
this evening?

229
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,672
That's okay.

230
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,551
I want to serve you as much as I can.

231
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,350
I don't know how much time
I have left to do this for you.

232
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,949
Some day, I...

233
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,277
Nak, why do you say such a thing?

234
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,152
You sound like you are leaving me.

235
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,078
Mak...

236
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,991
Mak...

237
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,197
Mak. I love you very much.

238
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,836
I'll never leave you.

239
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,795
But I'm afraid...

240
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,550
Nak, what are you afraid of?

241
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,159
I'll never leave you, either.

242
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,434
We will be together

243
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,873
till death do us part, Nak.

244
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,558
Let's go. It's late.
Let's get into the house.

245
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,308
Ouch!

246
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,031
Tomorrow I get some wood to fix it.

247
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,035
Nak!
Why are these rats all over the house?

248
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,470
What are you doing down there?

249
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,632
I'm looking for an axe.

250
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,558
I need some wood to fix the stairs.

251
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,034
Have you seen it?

252
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,639
It's stuck at the post. Seen it?

253
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,433
Um!

254
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,830
Um! When are you here?

255
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,720
Easy!

256
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,119
How are you?

257
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,710
How is Yuan?

258
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,278
Um! What is it? You act like a theif.

259
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,080
Mak. I have an important thing to tell you.

260
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,640
Listen carefully.

261
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,080
What is it?

262
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,992
You don't have to make it
so complicated.

263
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,749
Mak, your wife is dead.
Nak died long ago.

264
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,040
Damn it! Um, are you joking?

265
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,678
Are you kidding me?

266
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,680
I'm not. I'm serious.

267
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,114
Nak died while delivering her baby
month ago.

268
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,080
Stop! Stop it!

269
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,640
This is too much.

270
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,400
Son of a Bitch! Why are you accusing
my wife of being dead?

271
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,760
It's not funny.

272
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,160
Mak. I'm not lying. She died in labor.

273
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,800
Everyone knows it.

274
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,640
You weren't here so you didn't know that.

275
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,120
Liar! I live with my wife and my baby.
You can see it.

276
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,076
Why are you lying to me?

277
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,960
Do I look stupid to you?

278
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,720
You do.

279
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,760
You live with the ghost.
Don't you know it.

280
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,120
Stop it, Um!

281
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,200
If you weren't my best friend,

282
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,960
I knock you down to the ground.

283
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,160
Mak, I'm not lying.

284
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,440
I swear over my dead body.

285
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,273
I tied up her corpse by myself.

286
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,880
Um! Do you hear that?
My baby is crying.

287
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,040
Yes. The ghost's baby.

288
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,190
Um! Son of a Bitch!

289
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,760
You! Damn you!

290
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,149
You call my baby a ghost.
Son of a bitch.

291
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,400
I'll kill you today.

292
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,800
Go ahead. Come on. Kill me.

293
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,078
Go. Get the hell out of here.

294
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,240
We're no longer friends.

295
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,071
Don't let me see you again.

296
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,080
Fine.

297
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,680
I try very hard to tell you
and you don't believe me.

298
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,875
Go ahead. Live with the ghost!

299
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,358
What's wrong with Dang?
He keeps crying.

300
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,960
Nothing's wrong.
He is crying for his mom.

301
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,960
He needs to be with me all the time.

302
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,190
He would surely cry without my sight

303
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,315
Have you got some wood?

304
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,310
Not yet. I had met Um.

305
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,080
I was glad seeing him.

306
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:11,236
But he was strange, saying bullshit.

307
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,713
What did he say?

308
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,110
He told me that you died in labor.

309
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,720
Bad mouth!
He called your and our baby ghosts.

310
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,508
I got so angry that I hit him away.

311
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,597
What was wrong with him?

312
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,634
Entering ordination doesn't do him
any good. Liar!

313
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,597
Strange!

314
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,039
Are you crying, Nak?

315
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,913
What's wrong?

316
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,998
You've been away for too long.

317
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:13,120
People have been accusing me
hard lately.

318
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:20,231
I am so afraid that
I don't have a face to go out.

319
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,918
Why so?

320
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,079
They hate me.

321
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,920
They accused me of having an affair
when you were with the army.

322
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,471
They said Dang was
someone else's baby, not yours.

323
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,198
They called me bitch.

324
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,032
They have made up stories
to accuse me.

325
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:56,120
You were already pregnant
when I was called.

326
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,955
They all knew.
How could they accused you?

327
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:12,673
I don't know why they hate me so much.

328
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,276
Look at Um!

329
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,398
We were like brother and sister.

330
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,718
He could do it too. How am I hurt...

331
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,958
Dear Nak, don't be.

332
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:51,190
How can we stop gossiping people
from gossiping?

333
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,393
No matter what, I won't believe them.

334
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,800
Don't you give it a thought.

335
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,158
I'll kill them with my swords
whenever I meet.

336
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,393
Ghost. Nak, Ghost...

337
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,036
Ghost. Nak, Ghost...

338
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,680
Damn! Yuan.
Do you have to cry that loud?

339
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,033
I'm already scared.

340
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,949
Want the ghost to kill me? Moron!

341
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,760
Who got himself into?

342
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,240
I told you not to mess with them.

343
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,630
Now what?

344
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,800
If she knew,
she wouldn't let you get away with this.

345
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,440
She'd break your neck.

346
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,920
Yuan! Shut up!

347
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,760
You talk too much.

348
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,513
Thanks for wishing me death.

349
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,233
Isn't that true?

350
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,640
You've picked the right one-the ghost!

351
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,076
See for yourself tonight.

352
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,520
Come! Do come and break my neck.

353
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,956
Cut me into two pieces. Come!

354
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,080
- Come on, Nak! Come!
- Don't... Um! Don't defy her.

355
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,560
Come on, Nak!

356
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,600
She will really come.

357
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,680
- Come on! Nak! Um is here.
- Don't... Um!

358
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,240
- Come break my neck.
- Don't! Um! Don't go out!

359
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,080
I'm not scared of you.

360
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,640
Come, Nak!

361
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,160
Walk quickly!

362
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,390
I am, Jiad.

363
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,000
Faster!

364
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,160
It's dark. I hardly see the way.

365
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,200
You'll be reprimanded if you're back late.

366
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,680
I'll laugh at you.

367
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,717
Don't babble. Get in the boat.

368
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,754
Quick.

369
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,880
Row smoothly.

370
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,359
OK.

371
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,640
It doesn't move. It's stuck.

372
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,870
Throw the light at it.

373
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,640
Ghost!

374
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,555
Help! Ghost!

375
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,200
One at a time!

376
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,360
How will I know what's going on?

377
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,320
Father!
The ghost Nak is menacing around now.

378
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,800
She willed many people.

379
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:59,640
If we don't stop her, more people die.

380
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,800
What do you think?

381
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:10,800
I'll find a ghost banister to stop her.

382
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,960
I don't want to see people die anymore.

383
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,320
This ghost banister is very good.

384
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,520
He could bust ghosts.

385
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,760
A lot of people came to him.

386
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,600
I think he can do for us.

387
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Think carefully. Don't rush.

388
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,560
Think it through.

389
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,788
I think no more.

390
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,680
It was Mee. Then, Um.

391
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,435
I won't let the Ghost Nak
kill me that easily.

392
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,190
We'll be prepared.

393
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,760
Tonight, we'll go burn her house
to the ground.

394
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,760
Calm down, In!

395
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,480
If you burn here, how about Mak?

396
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,720
If he listens to us and leaves her,
I spare his life.

397
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,920
If the still mistakes bad for good
and insists on living with the ghosts,

398
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,710
I'll burn him all dead.

399
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,714
Who is coming with me? Let's go!

400
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,278
Mak... Mak...

401
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,351
Mak... Mak...

402
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,153
Father!

403
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,950
What brings you here? Please come in.

404
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,079
Are you alone?

405
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,600
Yes. Nak went out
for some morning glory vegetable.

406
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,079
She'll be back soon.

407
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,159
Please make yourself comfortable.

408
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,351
Have some areca palm and betal leaves.

409
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,836
I'm fine now.

410
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:16,560
How are you?
I haven't seen you for long.

411
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,440
I've always wanted to visit you
but haven't got a chance yet.

412
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,800
It's family business.

413
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:30,880
Mak, I have an important thing to tell you.

414
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,160
What Um told you yesterday
and you didn't believe...

415
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,594
It was true. It is true, Mak.

416
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,160
What is true?

417
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,600
That Nak's dead in labor.

418
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:52,720
I can tell you that you live with the ghosts.

419
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,870
Do you know it, Mak?

420
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:00,280
Father! Father! Why are you lying?

421
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,440
I live with her days and nights.

422
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,351
How can she be the ghost?

423
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,600
This is my baby, Dang.
In the cradle. You see...

424
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,910
Come see for yourself,
human or ghost?

425
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,360
Mak, listen to me just for one time.

426
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:26,760
Nak is dead. Everyone knows.

427
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,680
I know that they hate Nak.

428
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,513
They've been accusing her
about things everyday.

429
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,040
Um was one of them.

430
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,316
I got angry and hit him away.

431
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,357
Mak. Do you know that
Um is dead? He died!

432
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,280
Um died?

433
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,400
Nak broke his neck last night

434
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,880
because he came to tell you this.

435
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,438
You're crazy.

436
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,876
The silly things you're talking about.

437
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,720
Look! If it wasn't you,

438
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,438
I kicked you to the floor minutes ago.

439
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,360
Alright.

440
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,840
I came all the way to tell you this

441
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,116
and you don't believe me. Suit yourself.

442
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,560
If you want to see the truth,

443
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,800
concentrate. Keep the Buddha in mind.

444
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,352
Bend over to the front and look between
your legs. The truth will reveal itself to you.

445
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:40,040
Are you leaving? Wait for a while.

446
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,440
Nak is coming back.

447
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,400
You see her with your own eyes.

448
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,075
Never mind. Let's hurry!

449
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,720
Here it is!

450
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,872
Yuan, he's here.

451
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,760
Please come in.
Soothe yourself with some water.

452
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,311
Chuay, bring water here right away.

453
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,720
Novice, put my staff in my bag.

454
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,312
Yes, Your dignitary.

455
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:00,640
We should keep amulets for later.

456
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,520
I have an important thing to do.

457
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:09,277
I have to leave now.
We'll discuss it later.

458
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,440
Where are you going?

459
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,271
Prakanong District.

460
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:42,471
Move! Jiad! Let me!

461
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm not Jiad.

462
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,228
Ouch! Father!

463
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:52,593
Drink it! Drink!

464
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:02,712
I'll lead you to burn down Nak's house.

465
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,271
Kill it!

466
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,874
Go! Go!

467
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,760
If you want to see the truth.

468
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,360
Concentrate. Keep The Buddha in mind.

469
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:00,354
Bend over to the front and look between
your legs. The truth will reveal itself to you.

470
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,837
Mak...

471
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,838
Mak...

472
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,838
Burn it!

473
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,751
Mak! Come on now!

474
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,633
Mar! Do you hear me?

475
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,791
Burn it! Now!

476
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,511
How far would you push to me?

477
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,712
I didn't intervene your business.

478
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,000
Why do you have to do mine?

479
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,440
Nak. Ghost must be with ghosts.

480
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,720
You live with men
and kill men for pleasure.

481
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,474
I burn you to death today.

482
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:14,078
I live with my family, never kill anyone.

483
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,720
They died because of their won Karma.

484
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,919
They tried to part my family. I didn't do it.

485
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,400
Today, you harm me first.

486
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,197
You burn my house.

487
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,757
I show you what can become of me.

488
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,234
Quick!

489
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,800
Why are you standing there.
Come up here.

490
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,759
Pass the holy thread around in circle.

491
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,833
Fast! Fast!

492
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,595
Tie up the holy thread.

493
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,600
Sit. Don't go anywhere. Sit down.

494
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,720
Sit. Don't go anywhere. Sit down. Mak...

495
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,879
Ghost Nak!

496
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:10,711
Don't panic. Keep chanting.

497
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,510
Mak...

498
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:26,160
Nak... Scaring the monks is a sin.

499
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:31,200
Be gone. Don't bother Mak.

500
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,240
Father, let my husband go and I leave.

501
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:39,080
I can't. Nak, you are a ghost.

502
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,520
Give up your human life.

503
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,480
No. I listen to nobody.

504
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,320
You part my family.

505
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,280
You monk! Let my husband go.

506
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,236
See for yourselves!

507
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,837
Keep chanting... Keep on.

508
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,280
Mak... Mak...

509
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,751
Come to your wife and baby.

510
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,993
Don't you pity on me?

511
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:22,113
Mak... please come.

512
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,873
I have nothing left.

513
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,915
Nak...

514
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,872
Mak, don't go.

515
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,790
Stop chanting! Stop! She's gone.

516
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,270
My sermon is working!

517
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,553
Father... Father.

518
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,680
Big trouble!

519
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,520
What is it, Bua?

520
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,200
Tui and his people dig Nak's grave.

521
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,760
I saw the ghost banister
was doing something with Nak's corpse.

522
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,160
The Hell with it!

523
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,354
Nak...

524
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,480
Don't... Mak... don't go out.

525
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,473
Damn! Anybody stops him! Mak!

526
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,153
Don't!

527
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,354
Mak! Hang on!

528
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,909
If you want to harm my wife,
do it over my dead body.

529
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,470
Nak... Nak...

530
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,475
Drag him away... quick!

531
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,231
Bring the corpse up here.

532
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,639
Hold him tight.
Don't let him spoil my rituals.

533
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,038
Let me go! Let me go!

534
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,711
Don't go it to her!

535
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,872
Don't!

536
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,758
Don't!

537
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,910
Stop! What the hell are you doing?
Stop now!

538
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,917
Nak!

539
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,715
Don't! Nak! Don't!

540
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:29,840
The High Dignitary
wants you away from here.

541
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,150
No one is allowed
to enter unless he finishes.

542
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,559
Do come up here and talk.

543
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,880
Mak... is Mak here?

544
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,400
Yes.

545
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,790
The High Dignitary needs you in there.

546
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,194
Give her your farewell.

547
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:02,955
Look, Dang is sleeping.

548
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,192
Nak...

549
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,834
Nak... Dear Nak.

550
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,552
Mak...

551
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,191
Mak...

552
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:41,998
My fate is small.

553
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:53,353
I must go to serve the High Dignitary
until I pay off my Karma.

554
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:04,394
I can no longer serve you.

555
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,960
Mak...

556
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,757
Nak...

557
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:32,988
We two must have been blessed
with togetherness only this far.

558
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:41,397
I wish we'd be born husband
and wife again in our next lives, Nak.

559
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,676
Mak... Be gone. It's the time.

560
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,428
Mak...

561
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,320
Nak.

562
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,151
Mak...

563
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,760
Who's the Master of Mahabud Temple?

564
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,228
I am.

565
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,477
Be blessed.

566
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:35,360
I now have Nak's spirit dwelled
in this bone

567
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,600
shall bring it with me.

568
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,800
Nak will no longer disturb anyone.

569
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:48,040
You may please arrange her funeral,
along with others.

570
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,156
Yes, Your Dignitary.

571
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:56,754
Very well. I may go. Be blessed to you all.

572
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,872
No one has heard of Nak's
thriller menace again ever since.

573
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,800
The High Dignitary Buddhacharn
To made a girdle brooch

574
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,796
out of the headbone relics
and wore it till his last day.

575
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:08,880
The legend has it that after
Somedej To's passing away,

576
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,320
the brooch became in possession of his

577
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,153
Royal Highness
Prince Chumbhorn Ketudomsak.

578
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:18,272
Later, handed down to many others,
nondetected.

579
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:23,358
Till now nobody knows
where the item is.

580
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,840
Today, the headbone relics
where Nak's spirit lives

581
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,434
is lost in the place of nowhere.

582
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,320
Only the legend remains.
Immortal love of the faithful wife.

583
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:43,873
Its story always revives in the heart
that beats of every life.
