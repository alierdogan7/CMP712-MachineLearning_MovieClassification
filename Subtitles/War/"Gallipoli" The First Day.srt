00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,201
So Captain Taylor
has moved from down here

the best we can.

What's the size of
Taylor's force, then?

362
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,850
About 60 men.

- Right.
-Get back there immediately.

We send what we can, but tell him
he must hold that position.

Yes, sir.

but if we are to re-embark

871
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,802
"it must be done at once."
Re-embark?

872
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,043
Birdwood's generals
want to abandon

873
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,850
the Anzac position altogether?

874
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,650
- When did you get this?
-Thirty minutes ago.

875
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,043
I've given the order for all boats
to stand by to evacuate.

876
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,004
Admiral. Withdrawal?

877
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,891
It can be done.

878
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,849
But it sticks in the craw.

879
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,327
Aye. It does.

880
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,890
Thursby?

881
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,487
It'll take the best part of three days
to get them all off.

882
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,290
And where are the Turks?

883
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,249
On top of them, sir.

884
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,969
Well, then...

885
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,968
...there we are.

886
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,805
To Lieutenant-General Birdwood,

887
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,850
Australia and New Zealand
Army Corps.

888
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,803
Your news is indeed serious.

889
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,720
But there is nothing for you to do
but dig right in

890
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,530
and stick it out.

891
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,001
- Eh, Braith?
-Absolutely, sir.

892
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,005
It will take at least two days
to re-embark you,

893
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,686
which Admiral Thursby
will explain to you.

894
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,166
Down the coast, Hunter-Weston,
despite his heavy losses,

895
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,687
will be advancing tomorrow,

896
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,923
which should divert pressure
from you.

897
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,566
Make a personal appeal
to your men and to Godley's

898
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,361
to make a supreme effort
to hold their ground.

899
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,211
Signed, Ian Hamilton.

900
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,162
P.S. - You have got through
the difficult business...

901
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,524
...and now all you have to do
is dig, dig, dig...

902
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,569
...until you are safe.

903
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:17,368
So, gentlemen, not quite
the reply we expected.

904
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,761
He's right of course - to go back
is probably more dangerous

905
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,763
than to go forward.

906
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,605
So it's a fait accompli.
Nothing more to be done.

907
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,650
BIRDWOOD: Except get this message
somehow to the line.

908
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,929
We must let the men know
that there'll be no falling back.

WALKER: "Dig, dig, dig
until you are safe."

910
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,126
A strange order from an OC.

911
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,089
Hardly our business, Walker.

912
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,163
I don't question the order, Bill,

913
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,970
I simply note that it's not...

914
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,885
BIRDWOOD: Gentlemen,
I remind you - time is running out.

915
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,407
The Turks are well-advanced.

916
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,847
Utilise whatever communications
we have.

917
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,923
We must start entrenching.

918
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,923
Yes, sir.

01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,966
Could you just hold his chin
just for a moment?

922

- Yeah.
-(MAN CHOKES)

923
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,763
Get your fingers

924

Here, push his tongue up.

925
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,930
That's good, son, push hard -

926
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,764
keep his tongue forward
or he'll choke.

927
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,570
That's good.

The first blow
is half the battle, sir.

Don't forget that.

943
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,286
Indeed. Hmm.

944
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,328
- Would you like a whisky, sir?
- Mmm.

01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,204
- Goodnight, sir.
