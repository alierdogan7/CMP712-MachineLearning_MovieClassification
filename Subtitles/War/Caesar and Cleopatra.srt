00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,250
(Men Laughing)

2
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,522
(Dice Rattling]

3
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,884
By Apis!

4
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,481
Persian, thy gods are good to thee.

5
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,061
Try yet again, O Captain.
Double or quits.

6
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,392
No more. I'm not in the vein.

7
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,038
Captain! A stranger approaches!

8
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,573
Stand! Who goes there?

9
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,649
The bearer of evil tidings.

10
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,479
(Captain]
Pass him in!

11
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,332
(Laughing]

12
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,464
Who art thou that laughest
in the house of Cleopatra the queen...

13
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,065
and in the teeth of Belzanor,
the captain of her guard?

14
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,169
I am Bel Affris, descended from the gods.

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,078
- Hail, cousin.
- (Others) Hail, cousin!

16
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:35,177
(Laughs) All the queen's guards
are descended from the gods... save myself.

17
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,849
I am a Persian descended from many kings.

18
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,926
Hail, cousins.

19
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,324
Hail, mortal.

20
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,296
You have been in battle, Bel Affris,
and you are a soldier among soldiers.

21
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,130
You will not let the queen's women
have the first of your tidings.

22
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,204
I have no tidings...

23
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,003
except that we shall all
have our throats cut presently...

24
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,840
women, soldiers and all.

25
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,914
I thought so.
Tell us what befell.

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,108
- Aye! Tell us!
- Tell us! Tell us!

27
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,144
Know then that I serve in the guard
of the temple of Ra here in Memphis.

28
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,416
We went to Alexandria
to inquire of King Ptolemy...

29
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,856
how we of Egypt should deal
with the Roman, Pompey...

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,724
newly come to our shores after his defeat
by Caesar at Pharsalia.

31
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,458
Caesar defeated Pompey?
Does Roman, then, fight Roman?

32
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,058
Even as Egyptian fights Egyptian.

33
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,969
What did you learn from the queen's brother,
Ptolemy the pretender?

34
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:31,339
We learnt that Caesar is coming also
in hot pursuit of his foe...

35
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,844
and that Ptolemy has slain Pompey.

36
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,108
Nay, more.
We found that Caesar is already come.

37
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,047
For we had not made half a day's journey
on our way back...

38
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,120
when we came upon a city rabble
fiying from his legions.

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,123
And ye the temple guard...
did you not withstand these legions?

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,853
What men could, that we did.

41
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,156
But this Caesar throws a legion at you
where you are weakest...

42
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,163
as he throws a stone from a catapult.

43
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:57,362
And that legion is as a man with one head,
a thousand arms... and no religion.

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,995
- I have fought against them, and I know.
- (Soldiers Chortling)

45
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,131
- Were you frightened, cousin?
- (Laughing)

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,905
- No, cousin, but I was beaten.
- (Laughing)

47
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,674
- Could you not die?
- There was no time.

48
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,373
All was over in a moment.

49
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,283
But now I am come to warn you
that you must open your gates to Caesar...

50
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,514
for his advance guard
is scarce an hour behind me...

51
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,183
and there is not an Egyptian warrior
left standing between you and his legions.

52
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,193
- Woe! Alas!
- Nail him to the door! Quick!

53
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,190
Now this news will run through the palace
like fire through stubble.

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,598
What shall we do
to save the women from the Romans?

55
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,762
- Why not kill them?
- Because we should have to pay blood money.

56
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,636
Better let the Romans kill them.
It's cheaper.

57
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,609
- O subtle one. O serpent.
- But your queen.

58
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,976
True. We must carry off Cleopatra.
I will take her on the crupper of my horse.

59
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,879
- (Women Screaming)
- Fly! Fly!

60
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:49,387
- What's the matter now?
- The sacred white cat has been stolen!

61
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,083
(Screaming, Shouting)

62
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,689
 (Blowing Horn)

63
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,284
(Hammer Ringing On Anvil)

64
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,395
(Men Chattering)

65
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,682
Hail, Sphinx.

66
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,886
Salutation from Julius Caesar.

67
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,122
I have wandered in many lands
seeking the lost region...

68
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,533
from which my birth into this world
exiled me...

69
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,435
and the company of creatures
such as I myself.

70
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,702
I found fiocks and pastures,
men and cities...

71
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,871
but no other Caesar...

72
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,610
no air native to me,
no man kindred to me...

73
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,882
none who can do my day's deed
or think my night's thought.

74
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,549
In the little world yonder, Sphinx...

75
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,116
my place is as high as yours
in this great desert.

76
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,562
Only I wander, and you sit still.

77
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,260
I conquer, and you endure.

78
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,394
I work and wonder.

79
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,438
You watch and wait.

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,341
Sphinx, you and I...
strangers to the race of men...

81
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,913
are no strangers to one another.

82
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,144
Have I not been conscious of you
and of this place since I was born?

83
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,651
Rome is a madman's dream.

84
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,424
This is my reality.

85
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,654
My way hither was the way of destiny...

86
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,789
for I am he of whose genius
you are the symbol-

87
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,335
part brute, part woman...

88
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,463
and part god.

89
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,939
Nothing of man in me at all.

90
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,434
Have I read your riddle, Sphinx?

91
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,537
(Woman]
Old gentleman.

92
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,946
Immortal gods.

93
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,019
Old gentleman, don't run away.

94
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,423
"Old gentleman, don't run away"?

95
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,152
- This toJulius Caesar?
- Old gentleman.

96
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,589
Sphinx, you presume on your centuries.

97
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,865
I'm younger than you, though your voice
is but a girl's voice as yet.

98
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,100
Climb up here, quickly,
or the Romans will come and eat you.

99
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,275
A child at its breast.

100
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,713
A divine child.

101
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,717
Come up, quickly.

102
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,185
You must get up at its side
and creep round.

103
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,292
Who are you?

104
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,692
Cleopatra, queen of Egypt.

105
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,465
Queen of the Gypsies, you mean.

106
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,333
You mustn't be disrespectful to me,
or the sphinx will let the Romans eat you.

107
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,406
Come up. It's quite cozy here.

108
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,278
What a dream.

109
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,643
What a magnifiicent dream.

110
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,148
Only let me not wake.
(Laughs)

111
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,150
Take care.

112
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,354
Ah. That's right. Now sit down.

113
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,188
You may have the other paw.

114
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,525
It is very powerful and will protect us...

115
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,497
but it wouldn't take any notice of me
or keep me company.

116
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,036
I'm glad you've come.
I was very lonely.

117
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,196
Did you happen to see
a white cat anywhere?

118
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,001
Have you lost one?

119
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,940
Yes. The sacred white cat.
Isn't it dreadful?

120
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,069
I brought him here
to sacrifice him to the sphinx.

121
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,704
But when we got a little way from the city,
a black cat called him...

122
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,045
and he jumped out of my arms
and ran away to it.

123
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,952
Do you think that the black cat
can have been...

124
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,785
my great-great-great-grandmother?

125
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,349
Your great-great-great-grandmother?

126
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,294
Well, why not? Nothing would surprise me
on this night of nights.

127
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,661
I think it must have been.

128
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,666
My great-great-grandmother's
great-grandmother...

129
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,168
was a black kitten of the sacred white cat.

130
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,933
And my blood is made with Nile water.

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,940
That is why my hair is so wavy.

132
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,438
What are you doing here this time of night?

133
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,982
- Do you live here?
- Of course not. I am the queen.

134
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,144
And I shall live in the palace of Alexandria
when I've killed my brother who drove me out of it.

135
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,244
When I'm old enough, I shall do just what I like.

136
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,018
I shall be able to poison the slaves
and see them wriggle...

137
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:31,290
and pretend to Ftatateeta, my nurse,
that she's to be put into the fiery furnace.

138
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,197
Meanwhile, why are you not at home
and in bed?

139
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,929
Because the Romans are coming
to eat us all.

140
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,063
- You aren't at home in bed either.
- Oh, yes, I am.

141
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:46,338
I live in a tent, and I am now in that tent
fast asleep and dreaming.

142
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,381
Do you suppose I believe you are real,
you impossible little dream witch?

143
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,078
You are a funny old gentleman.
I like you.

144
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,654
That spoils the dream.

145
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,656
Why don't you dream that I'm young?

146
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,455
I wish you were.
Only I think I should be more afraid of you.

147
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,657
I like men, especially young men
with round, strong arms.

148
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,666
But I'm afraid of them.

149
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,498
You are old and rather wrinkly.

150
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,040
But you have a nice voice,
and I like to have someone to talk to.

151
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,302
Though I think you are a little mad.

152
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,470
It is the moon that makes you
talk to yourself in that silly way.

153
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,479
Oh, you heard that, did you?

154
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,811
I was saying my prayers to the Great Sphinx.

155
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,818
- But this isn't the Great Sphinx.
- What?

156
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,911
This is only a dear little kitten
of the sphinx.

157
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,514
Why, the Great Sphinx is so big,
it has a temple between its paws.

158
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,151
This is my pet sphinx.

159
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,856
Tell me. Do you think the Romans
have any sorcerers...

160
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,989
who could take us away from the sphinx
by magic?

161
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,068
Why? Are you afraid of the Romans?

162
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,832
Oh, they would eat us if they caught us.
They are barbarians.

163
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,736
Their chief is called Julius Caesar.

164
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,071
His father was a tiger
and his mother a burning mountain...

165
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,077
and his nose is like an elephant's trunk.

166
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,876
They all have long noses
and ivory tusks and little tails...

167
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,382
and seven arms
with a hundred arrows in each.

168
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,852
And they live on human fiesh.

169
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,855
Would you like me to show you
a real Roman?

170
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,188
No. Oh, you're frightening me.

171
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,161
No matter. This is only a dream.

172
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,232
- It is not a dream. It is not a dream. See?
- (Yelps)

173
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,631
How dare you!

174
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,330
You said you were dreaming.
I... I only wanted to show you.

175
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,406
Oh, come, come. Don't cry.

176
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,408
- (Sniffiing)
- A queen mustn't cry.

177
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,208
Cleopatra, can you see my face well?

178
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,444
Yes.

179
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,520
It is so white in the moonlight.

180
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,987
Are you sure it is the moonlight...

181
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,524
that makes me look whiter
than an Egyptian?

182
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:45,654
Do you notice that I have
a rather long nose?

183
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,926
- It is a Roman nose, Cleopatra.
- (Screams)

184
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,628
(Shrieking)
Bite him in two, sphinx! Bite him in two!

185
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,535
I meant to sacrifice the white cat.
Indeed I did. Indeed!

186
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,633
Cleopatra, shall I show you a way
to prevent Caesar from eating you?

187
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,009
Do, do, do. I will steal the crown jewels
and give them to you.

188
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,776
I will make the river Nile
water your lands twice a year.

189
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,352
My child, your gods are afraid of the Romans.

190
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,549
You see? The sphinx dare not bite me
nor prevent me carrying you off toJulius Caesar.

191
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,455
You won't. You won't.
You said you wouldn't.

192
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,496
Caesar never eats women,
but he eats girls and cats.

193
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,499
Now, you're a silly little girl,
and you're descended from the black kitten.

194
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,262
You're both a girl and a cat.

195
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,066
- And will he... eat me?
- Yes.

196
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,075
Unless you make him believe
that you're a woman.

197
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,637
Oh. Then you must get a sorcerer
to make a woman of me.

198
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,943
- Are you a sorcerer?
- Perhaps.

199
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,111
But it'll take a long time, and this very night
in the palace of your fathers...

200
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,246
you must stand face-to-face with Caesar.

201
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,755
No, no. I daren't!

202
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,555
Whatever dread may be in your soul,
however terrible Caesar may be to you...

203
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,120
you must confront him
as a brave woman and a great queen.

204
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,132
And you must feel no fear.

205
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,930
If your hand shakes,
if your voice quavers...

206
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,403
- Then night and death.
- (Sighs)

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,531
But if he thinks you worthy to rule...

208
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:07,806
he will set you on the throne by his side
and make you the real ruler of Egypt.

209
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,144
No. He will find me out.
He will find me out.

210
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,844
He is easily deceived by women.

211
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,980
- Their eyes dazzle him.
- Then we will cheat him.

212
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,558
If you do that,
he will eat you at one mouthful.

213
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,456
Oh, no, no. Please. I will be good.
I will do whatever you tell me.

- What was that?

216
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,364
Caesar's voice.

217
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,527
Let us run away.
Come! Oh, come!

218
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,834
You are safe with me until you
stand on your throne to receive Caesar.

219
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,306
- Lead me to your palace in the desert.
- Oh, I will. I will.

220
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,309
Come, come, come.
The gods are angry.

221
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,244
- Do you not feel the earth shaking?
- It is the tread of Caesar's legions.

222
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,646
This way, quickly.
And let us look for the white cat as we go.

223
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,877
It is he who has turned you into a Roman.

224
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,315
Incorrigible.

225

You're begging her.

Farewell.

No, no, no! Don't leave me.

250
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,394
A Roman does not stay with queens
who are afraid of their slaves.

251
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,024
I am not afraid.
Indeed, I am not afraid.

Oh, I love you for making me a queen.

I will make all the men I love kings.

with round, strong arms.

I shall whip them to death.

Caesar's in there.
I'm going now to join him.

374

Keep a platoon of picked men within call.
They may be wanted.

- Yes, sir.

I am the first-born son

who was your king.

390

from his throne...

- Yes.

I forget what the gods would not suffer.

396

The king wished to say the gods would not suffer
the impiety of his sister to go unpunished.

(Ptolemy)
Yes, yes. I remember the rest of it.

398
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:47,838
Therefore, the gods sent a stranger...
one Mark Antony...

399
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,705
a Roman captain of horsemen
across the sands of the desert...

400
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,906
and he set my father again
upon the throne.

And now that my father is dead...

403

my sister Cleopatra would snatch
the kingdom from me...

404
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,153
and reign in my place.

- "Will not maintain"...

Oh, yes.

she has cast a spell
on the Roman Julius Caesar...

409
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,600
to uphold her false pretense to rule Egypt.

410
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,141
Take notice then that I will not suffer...

411
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,473

Tell the king, Achillas, how many soldiers
and horsemen follow Julius Caesar.

00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,864
But two Roman legions, O King.

418
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,960

a thousand horsemen.

The king permits
the Roman commander to enter.

424

Which is the king...
the man or the boy?

425
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,439
I am Pothinus,
the guardian of my lord the king.

426
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,916
So you're the king.

427
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,419
Dull work at your age, eh?

428
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,421
Your servant, Pothinus.

- Achillas, the king's general.

Ah. A general.

431
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,557
I am a general myself,
but I began too old.

432
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,497
Health and many victories, Achillas.

433

As the gods will, Caesar.

434
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,997
And you, sir, are...

435
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,300
Theodotus, the king's tutor.

436
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,138
So, you teach men
how to be kings, Theodotus.

437
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,212
That is very clever of you.

438
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,482
And, uh, this place?

439
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,644
The council chamber of the chancellors
of the king's treasury, Caesar.

440
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,552
That reminds me. I want some money.

441
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,022
The king's treasury is poor, Caesar.

442
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,219
Yes. I noticed there is but one chair in it.

443
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,558
Bring a chair there, some of you, for Caesar.

444

- Caesar.
- Oh, no, no, my boy.

00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,134
That is your chair of state.

Oh, I forgot. I had not made my companions
known to you, Pothinus.

453

This gentleman is Rufio,
my comrade-in-arms.

- This is Britannus, my secretary.
- How do you do?

Now, Pothinus, to business.

- Impossible.

464

There is not so much money
in the king's treasury.

465
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,364
The royal taxes have not been collected
for a whole year.

Is it possible that Caesar,

470

can find time to occupy himself
with such a trifie as our taxes?

My friend, taxes are the chief business
of a conqueror of the world.

You must pay, Pothinus.

473

But in return for your bounty, I will settle
this dispute about the throne for you, if you will.

474
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,537
You say the matter
has been at issue for a year.

to take everything from me? (Crying)

You are not to be king,
you little crybaby.

Come here, my boy, and stand by me.

495

Take your throne. I don't want it.

and sit down in your place!

Always take a throne when it's offered you.

- Now, Pothinus...
- Aren't you going to speak to me?

Be quiet. Open your mouth again
before I give you leave...

500
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,939
and you shall be eaten.

501
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,533
I am not afraid.
A queen must not be afraid.

Eat my husband there if you like.
He's afraid.

- That little thing.

Caesar, you're a stranger here
and do not know our laws.

506
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,154
The kings and queens of Egypt may not marry
except with our own royal blood.

507
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,288
Ptolemy and Cleopatra
are born king and consort...

- Not proper?
- I say it is a scandal.

511
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,802
Scandal or not, my friend,
it opens the gates of peace.

512
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,171
Hear then what I propose.

513
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,874
Hear Caesar there!

514
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,943
Ptolemy and Cleopatra
shall reign jointly in Egypt.

515
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,023
- (Crowd Gasps]
- (Pothinus] Monstrous!

516
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,891
Peace with honor, Pothinus?

517
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,329
- (Man] What conceit!
- (Pothinus) A Roman trick!

518
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,900
No! We will not have it!

519
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,162
(Crowd Shouting)
No! No!

520
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,738
(Shouting Continues]

521
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,504
Caesar, be honest!

522
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,011
The money you are demanding
is the price of our freedom.

523
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,877
Take it and leave us
to settle our own affairs.

524
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,850
- Yes. Go back to your own country.
- (Crowd Clamoring)

525
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,977
Egypt belongs to us, not to you.

526
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,885
Egypt for the Egyptians!

527
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,753
(Crowd Shouting)
Egypt for the Egyptians!

528
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,689
Egypt for the Egyptians!

529
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,490
(Rufio)
Egypt for the Egyptians?

530
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,394
Do you forget there's a Roman army
of occupation here...

531
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,730
left by Aulus Gabinius when he set up
your toy king for you?

532
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,532
And now under my command.

533
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,437
I am the Roman general here, Caesar.

534
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,842
And also the Egyptian general, eh?

535
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,470
That is so, Caesar.

536
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,482
So you can make war on the Egyptians
in the name of Rome...

537
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,712
and on the Romans... on me if necessary...
in the name of Egypt.

538
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,721
That is so, Caesar.

539
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,259
And which side are you on at present,
if I may presume to ask, General?

540
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,726
On the side of the right...
and of the gods.

541
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,594
Mmm. How many men have you?

542
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,963
That will appear when I take the field.

543
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:07,697
Are your men Romans?
If not, it doesn't matter how many there are.

544
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,330
- (Pothinus] Insolence!
- We shall see, my friend.

545
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,604
(Laughs)
It is useless to try to bluff us, Rufio.

546
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,943
Caesar has been defeated before,
and he may be defeated again.

547
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,747
- What can you do with 4,000 men?
- (Crowd Laughing)

548
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,415
And what can you do without money?
Away with you!

549
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,424
(Crowd Clamoring)

550
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,427
- Go back to your deaths.
- Away with Caesar!

551
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,463
(Crowd)
Away with Caesar!

552
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,261
- (Pothinus] Away with you! Out of our country!
- (Crowd Shouting) Away with Caesar!

553
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,464
Caesar, why do you let them
talk to you like that?

554
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,974
Are you afraid?

555
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,238
Well, my dear, what they say is quite true.

556
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,610
But if you go away, I shall not be queen.

557
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,445
I shall not go away until you are queen.

558
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,722
(Hisses)

559
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,693
- (Women Gasping, Whispering]
- What is she doing?

560
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,130
Achillas, if you are not a fool...

561
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,202
you will take that girl
while she is under your hand.

562
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,362
Why not take Caesar as well, Achillas?

563
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,064
Well said, Rufio. Why not?

564
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,835
(Scoffs)
Try it, Achillas. Try it.

565
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,809
- Let us take Caesar and hold him!
- (Crowd Clamoring)

566
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,806
(Clamoring Continues)

567
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,009
(Rufio)
Guards! Guards there!

568
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,019
(Crowd Gasping, Clamoring)

569
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,257
(Britannus)
Peace, Egyptians!

570
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,663
You are Caesar's prisoners,
all of you.

571
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,963
Oh, no, no. By no means.

572
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,867
Caesar's guests, gentlemen.

573
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,736
Caesar's guests.

574
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,741
Won't you cut their heads off?

575
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,743
What, cut off your brother's head?

576
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,643
Why not?
He'd cut off mine if he got the chance.

577
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,717
- Wouldn't you, Ptolemy?
- I would.

578
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,786
I will, too, when I grow up.

579
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,056
(Sneers)

580
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:10,253
- Caesar, if you attempt to detain us...
- (Rufiio] He will succeed, Egyptian.

581
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,056
Make up your mind to that.

582
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,997
The road to Rome is open,
and you shall travel it if Caesar chooses.

583
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,592
I could do no less, Pothinus,
to secure the retreat of my own soldiers.

584
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,569
I am accountable for every life among them.

585
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,572
I am the king's guardian.

586
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,234
I stand on my right here.
Where is your right?

587
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,108
It is in Rufio's scabbard, my friend.

588
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,113
I may not be able
to keep it there much longer.

589
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,740
- (Crowd Muttering)
- And this is Roman justice.

590
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,285
Not Roman gratitude, I hope.

591
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,949
Is Caesar's life of so little account to him
that he forgets that we have saved it?

592
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,356
My life? Is that all?

593
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,522
Your life, your laurels, your future.

594
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,362
I can call a witness to prove that but for us...

595
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,837
the Roman army of occupation led by Pompey...
the greatest soldier in the world...

596
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,964
would now have Caesar at its mercy.

597
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,271
Ho there, Lucius Septimius!

598
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,211
Come forth and testify before Caesar.

599
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,544
No. No.

600
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,609
Yes, I say.
Let the military tribune bear witness.

601
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,486
(Theodotus]
Lucius Septimius.

602
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,225
Bear witness, Lucius Septimius.

603
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,464
Caesar came to Egypt
in pursuit of his foe.

604
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,506
Did we shelter his foe?

605
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,543
As Pompey's foot
touched the Egyptian shore...

606
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,112
his head fell by the stroke of my sword.

607
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,808
We have given you a full
and sweet measure of vengeance.

608
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,852
Vengeance?
If I could stoop to vengeance...

609
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:47,014
what would I not exact from you
as the price of this murdered man's blood?

610
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,358
Was he not my son-in-law, my ancient friend?

611
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,987
Am I Julius Caesar, or am I a wild beast...

612
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,158
that you fiing to me the gray head
of the old soldier, the laureled conqueror...

613
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,793
and then claim my gratitude for it?

614
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,065
Oh, begone. You fill me with horror.

615
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,600
(Septimius, Scoffiirg]
You have seen severed heads before, Caesar.

616
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,646
And severed right hands, too, I think...

617
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:14,047
some thousands of them
after you vanquished the king of the Gauls.

618
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:18,281
Did you spare him with all your clemency?
Was that vengeance?

619
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,789
Would that it had been.

620
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,791
Vengeance, at least, is human.

621
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,692
No, by the gods.

622
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,287
Those severed right hands...

623
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,563
and the brave king of the Gauls
basely strangled in a vault beneath the Capitol...

624
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,604
were a wise severity...

625
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:39,005
a necessary protection to the commonwealth,
a duty of statesmanship...

626
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,546
follies and fictions 1 0 times bloodier
than honest vengeance.

627
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,650
What a fool I was then.

628
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,917
To think that men's lives should be
at the mercy of such fools.

629
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,366
Lucius Septimius, pardon me.

630
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:14,069
Why should the slayer of the king of the Gauls
rebuke the slayer of Pompey?

631
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,715
You are free to go,
all here in this palace.

632
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,013
Free? Achillas's army... renegades and all?

633
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,087
Free, Rufio.

634
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,748
Lucius Septimius,
you're free to go with the rest.

635
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,554
Or stay if you will,
and I'll find a place for you in my service.

636
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,993
The odds are against you, Caesar.

637
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,558
I go.

638
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,130
Farewell.

639
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:48,075
Come, Pothinus, Achillas,
whilst there is yet time.

640
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,327
Do you suppose he'd let us go
if he had our heads in his hands?

641
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,261
Caesar, this is not good sense.

642
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,822
Your duty to Rome demands that her enemies
should be prevented from doing further mischief.

643
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,735
It's no use talking to him, Britannus.
You may save your breath to cool your porridge.

644
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,399
But mark this, Caesar.
Clemency's very well for you.

645
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,942
But what is it for your soldiers
who have to fight tomorrow...

646
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,171
the men you spared yesterday?

647
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:26,010
You may give what orders you please,
but l, for one, will take no prisoners.

648
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,016
I'll kill my enemies in the field.

649
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,484
Then I shall never have to fight them again.

650
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,752
(Sighs) Now, with your leave,
I'll see these gentry off the premises.

651
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,453
What? Have they left the boy alone?

652
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,256
Shame. Shame.

653
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,565
Come, Your Majesty.

654
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,907
Is he... Is he turning me out of my palace?

655
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,536
You're welcome to stay if you wish.

656
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,308
Go, my boy. I'll not harm you.

657
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,349
But you'll be safer
away among your friends.

658
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,146
Here, you're in the lion's mouth.

659
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:06,189
It's not the lion I fear, but the jackal.

660
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,986
- (Rufio Chuckling)
- Brave boy.

661
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,824
Little silly! You think that very clever.

662
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,023
Britannus, attend the king.

663
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,225
Give him in charge of that Pothinus fellow.

664
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,006
And this piece of goods...
what's to be done with her?

665
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,847
However, I suppose I may leave that to you.

666
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,380
Did you mean me to go with the rest?

667
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,216
You're free to do
just as you please, Cleopatra.

668
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,189
Then you don't care
whether I stay or not.

669
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,385
Of course, I'd rather you stayed.

670
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,621
Much, much rather?

671
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,497
Much, much rather.

672
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,092
Then I consent to stay...
because I am asked.

673
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,171
But I do not want to, mind.

674
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,148
That is quite understood.

675
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,083
- Totateeta!
- (Giggles)

676
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,349
Her name is not Totateeta.
'Tis Ftatateeta.

677
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:16,051
Well, Tafiatafeeta will forgive
the erring tongue of a Roman.

678
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,689
Tota, the queen will hold state
here in Alexandria.

679
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,597
Engage women to attend upon her
and do all that is needful.

680
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,136
Am I then the mistress
of the queen's household?

681
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:31,105
No. I am mistress of the queen's household.

682
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,702
Go and do as you are told, or I will have you
thrown into the Nile this very afternoon...

683
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,974
to poison the poor crocodiles.

684
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,142
Oh, no, no, no.

685
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,742
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

686
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,583
You are very sentimental, Caesar.

687
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,057
But you are clever.

688
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,060
And if you do as I tell you...

689
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,598
you will soon learn how to govern.

690
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,641
(Crowd Cheering)

691
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,874
(Man)
Pothinus!

692
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,386
(Crowd)
Hail! Hail, Pothinus!

693
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,481
- Achillas!
- Lucius Septimius!

694
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,288
Egypt for the Egyptians!

695
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,990
(Crowd)
Egypt for the Egyptians!

696
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:32,194
Egypt for the Egyptians!

697
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,862
(Crowd Clamoring)

698
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,047
(Laughs)

699
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,519
(No Audible Dialogue)

700
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,989
- What?
- Your barley water, Caesar.

701
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,665
Ftatateeta!

702
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,845
Ftatateeta!

703
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,016
Get up, child.
You must be bathed this morning.

704
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,679
No. I had my month's bath
the day before yesterday.

705
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,654
In future, you must have a bath every day.

706
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,725
No, no. I should die of it.

707
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,953
You must. Your life is changed.

708
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:42,555
You are still my child, but to all others
you are now a grown woman and a queen.

709
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,328
Yes. I am a queen.

710
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,268
Ftata, what will Caesar do with me?

711
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,340
Ask rather what you will do with him.

712
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,774
Ah. My child, you have charmed him.
You are safe. You are powerful.

713
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,642
I will guide you until you learn
how to guide yourself.

714
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,215
Fear nothing.

715
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,114
Who could fear Caesar?
He is not great and terrible.

716
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,119
He's only an elderly gentleman.

717
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,452
Rather sad-looking and wrinkled,
but very kind.

718
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:13,326
He is a magician, and magicians
can change their shapes as they please.

719
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,330
Everything about him is magical.

720
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,263
He would not sleep in the golden chamber...

721
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,564
but made his soldiers bring a bare stretcher
from the camp and put it in his study.

722
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,165
Even then, he did not sleep in it,
but sat up working like a slave all night.

723
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,938
Yet, everyone obeys him as if he were a god.

724
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,537
I think he is a god in disguise.

725
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,082
For he has changed your nature,
has he not?

726
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,948
Oh, yes, he has. That is true.

727
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,750
Ftatateeta, before he came...

728
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,883
I was afraid of you
more than anyone else on earth.

729
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:47,453
And now...
I'm not afraid of you at all.

730
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,795
Tell me. What must I do to begin with
now that I'm really a queen?

731
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,166
You must begin by having a bath every day.

732
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,762
- Oh.
- Come, child, and get it over.

733
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,366
- You will soon get used to it and love it.
- Never. It is too dreadful.

734
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,674
Oh, well, if I must be washed again so soon,
Ftatateeta, it must be a scented bath.

735
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,045
- Have you scented it?
- No. Caesar hates perfumes.

736
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,119
And if you redden your lips,
he will not kiss you. Come on.

737
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,399
He must indeed be a god.

738
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,601
(Sighs)
For only a god could be so unlike a man.

739
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,654
- No!
- (Guards Laughing]

740
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:16,779
Cleopatra, I really think
I must eat you after all.

741
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,515
You mustn't talk to me now
as if I were a child.

742
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,649
You have been growing up
since the sphinx introduced us that night.

743
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,727
You think you know
more than I do already.

744
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,160
No. That would be very silly of me.

745
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:31,496
Of course I know that, but...
Are you angry with me?

746
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,331
- No.
- Then why are you so thoughtful?

747
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,433
I have work to do.

748
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,703
Work? What nonsense.

749
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,609
You must remember you are a king now.
I have made you one.

750
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,706
- Kings don't work.
- And who told you that, little kitten, eh?

751
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,308
My father was king of Egypt,
and he never worked.

752
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,820
Well, he lost his throne.
And how did he get it back again?

753
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:57,724
I will tell you. A beautiful young man
with strong, round arms...

754
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:02,822
came over the desert with many horsemen
and gave my father back his throne.

755
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,833
I was only 1 2 then.

756
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,631
Oh, I wish he would come again
now that I am a queen.

757
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,638
I would make him my husband.

758
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,435
It might be managed perhaps...

759
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,510
for it was I who sent that beautiful young man
to help your father.

760
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,977
You know him?
Has he come with you?

761
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,344
Oh, I wish he had.

762
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,349
I wish he had.

763
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:29,922
He is many, many years
younger than you, is he not?

764
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,986
He is somewhat younger.

765
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,496
Would he be my husband, do you think,
if I asked him?

766
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,194
- Very likely.
- But I shouldn't like to ask him.

767
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,362
Could you... Could you not
persuade him to ask me...

768
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,633
without knowing that I wanted him to?

769
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,209
My poor child.

770
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,471
Why do you say that
as if you were sorry for me?

771
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,640
- Does he love anyone else?
- I'm afraid so.

772
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,980
Then I shall not be his first love.

773
00:50:56,086 --> 00:51:00,489
Not quite the first.
He is greatly admired by women.

774
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,616
Oh, I wish I would be the first.

775
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,493
But if he loves me,
I will make him kill all the rest.

776
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,088
Tell me. Is he still beautiful?

777
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,829
Do his round, strong arms
shine in the sun like marble?

778
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,373
He is in excellent condition
considering how much he eats and drinks.

779
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,442
(Groans)

780
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,773
You mustn't say common,
earthly things about him.

781
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,642
I love him. He is a god.

782
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:30,579
- What is his name?
- His name is Mark Antony.

783
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,587
Mark Antony.

784
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,958
Mark Antony.

785
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,595
Mark Antony.

786
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,689
- What a beautiful name.
- (Chuckles)

787
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,428
Oh, I love you for sending him
to help my father.

788
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,004
(Crowd Clamoring]

789
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,841
You must run away for a little,
and send my secretary to me.

790
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,639
Oh, no, no, no. I want to stay
and hear you talk about Mark Antony.

791
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,770
But if I don't get to work,
Pothinus and the rest of them...

792
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,941
will cut us off from the harbor,
and then the road to Rome will be blocked.

793
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,248
No matter. I don't want you
to go back to Rome.

794
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:06,345
But you want Mark Antony to come from it.

795
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,721
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I forgot.
Go quickly, Caesar.

796
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:14,320
And keep the way over the sea open
for my Mark Antony.

797
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,731
(Crowd Clamoring]

798
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,804
(Clamoring Continues)

799
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,315
- What now?
- This, Caesar.

800
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,949
- And two of my comrades killed in the marketplace.
- Why?

801
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,824
There's an army come to Alexandria
calling itself the Roman army.

802
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,262
- The Roman army of occupation.
- Commanded by one Achillas.

803
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,335
- Well?
- The citizens rose against us
when the army entered the gates.

804
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:56,895
- They set upon us. I cut my way out.
- Good. I'm glad to see you alive.

805
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,975
- Rufio, we're besieged.
- What, already?

806
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,339
- Caesar! Caesar!
- Yes, yes. I know.

807
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,503
Comrade, give the word to turn out
on the beach and stand with the boats.

808
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,638
Get your wound attended to.
Britannus, go with him.

809
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,717
Rufio.

810
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,147
- We have some ships in the west harbor. Burn them.
- Burn them?

811
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:15,986
Take every boat we have in the east harbor and
seize the Pharos... that island with the lighthouse.

812
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,959
Leave half our men behind to hold the beach
and the quay outside this palace.

813
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,962
That's the way home to Rome.

814
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,624
For the rest, Egypt for the Egyptians.

815
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,633
Well, you know best, I suppose.
Is that all?

816
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,828
That's all. Those ships burnt yet?

817
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,735
Be easy. I shall waste no time.

818
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,807
Caesar, Pothinus demands speech with you.

819
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,808
- Where is he?
- Waits in the council chamber.

820
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,209
In my opinion, he needs a lesson.
His manner is most insolent.

821
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,255
- Well, Pothinus?
- I have brought you our ultimatum, Caesar.

822
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,918
Ultimatum? The door was open.

823
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,086
You should have gone out through it
before you declared war.

824
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,324
- You're my prisoner now.
- I your prisoner?

825
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,128
Do you know that King Ptolemy...

826
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,931
with an army outnumbering
your little troop by a hundred to one...

827
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,028
is in possession of Alexandria?

828
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,107
Well, get out of here if you can.

829
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,507
And tell your friends not to kill
any more Romans in the marketplace.

830
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,843
Otherwise my soldiers,
who do not share my celebrated clemency...

831
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,848
will probably kill you.

832
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,010
Pass the word to the guard.
Pothinus is now prisoner.

833
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,554
Britannus, fetch my armor.

- And the east harbor? The lighthouse, Rufio.

Can I embark a legion in five minutes?

840

The first cohort's already on the quay.
If you want faster work, come and do it yourself.

00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,421
Patience. Who's impatient here... you or I?

843
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,185
Forgive me, Rufio,
and hurry them as much as you can.

844
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,454
(Man]
Help! Help! Help!

845
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,495
Help! Woe! Alas!

846
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,929
Woe! Alas!

847
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,763
- Help! Woe! Woe!
- What?

848
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,337
- Woe! Woe! Woe!
- What?

849
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,668
Help. Help. Help.

850
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,799
- Who is slain?
- Slain?

851
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,707
Worse than the death of 1 0,000 men.

852
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,871
Loss irreparable to mankind.

853
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,073
What's happened, man?

854
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,116
The fire has spread from your ships.

855
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,015
- The library of Alexandria is in fiames.
- Oh, is that all?

856
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,180
Rufio, is Britannus asleep?
I sent him for my armor an hour ago.

857
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,726
- Britannus! Britannicus!
- (Rufiio] Britannus!

858
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,627
Caesar, will you go down to posterity
as a barbarous soldier...

859
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,858
too ignorant to know the value of books?

860
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,491
Oh, Theodotus, I'm an author myself.

861
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,704
Good.

862
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,174
What is burning there
is the memory of mankind!

863
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,510
A shameful memory. Let it burn.

864
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,708
Would you destroy the past?

865
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,013
Aye, and build the future with its ruins.

866
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,614
Hearken to me, Theodotus, teacher of kings.

867
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,124
I cannot spare you a man
nor a bucket of water just now...

868
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,217
- But you shall pass freely out of the palace.
- Oh!

869
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,388
Away with you to Achillas.
Borrow his legions to put out the fire.

870
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,433
Caesar, posterity will bless you.

871
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,026
Will you stay to talk whilst
the memory of mankind is burning?

872
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,403
Sentry! Pass Theodotus out.
Away with you! Away with you!

873
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,874
I must save the library!

874
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:25,111
What's this? You let him go?
More clemency.

875
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,342
I have let him go to save the library.

876
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,045
- We must respect literature, Rufio.
- Folly on folly's head.

877
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,122
Besides, every Egyptian we imprison...

878
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,353
means imprisoning two good
Roman soldiers to guard him, eh?

879
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,658
I might have known there was some fox's trick
behind your fine talking.

880
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,325
(Laughing)

881
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,901
(Rufio)
All ready there?

882
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,267
- All ready!
- We await for Caesar!

883
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:52,341
Tell them Caesar is coming.
The rogues.

884
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,706
Ho, Caesar's guard there!
Push off.

885
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:58,406
All except the longboat.
Stand by it to embark.

886
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,120
I am going to dress you, Caesar.
Sit down.

887
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,623
Caesar, this is not proper.

888
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,524
These Roman helmets are so becoming.

889
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:19,368
Oh!
(Laughing)

890
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,369
What are you laughing at?

891
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,371
You're bald!

892
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:27,910
- Cleopatra.
- So that's why you wear the wreath... to hide it.

893
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,239
Peace, Egyptian.

894
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,176
They are the bays of the conqueror.

895
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,148
- Peace, thou... islander.
- (Blusters)

896
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,209
You should rub your head
with strong spirits of sugar, Caesar.

897
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,515
That will make it grow.

898
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,318
Cleopatra, do you like to be reminded
that you're very young?

899
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,892
No.

900
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:47,326
Neither do I like to be reminded
that I'm... middle-aged.

901
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,264
Now.

902
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,233
Oh. How nice.

903
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,004
You look only about 50 in it.

904
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,342
You mustn't speak in that manner to Caesar.

905
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:09,282
Is it true that when Caesar
caught you on that island...

906
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,353
you were painted all over blue?

907
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,685
Blue is the color worn by all Britons
of good standing.

908
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,691
In war, we stain our bodies blue...

909
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,661
so that, though our enemies
may strip us of our clothes and our lives...

910
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:23,254
they cannot strip us
of our respectability.

911
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,765
(Giggling]

912
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,302
Oh. Let me hang this on.

913
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,715
Now.

914
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,842
You look splendid.

915
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,419
Now, Caesar!

916
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,489
(Sighs)
Have you done talking?

917
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,285
The longboat awaits you.
The others race to the lighthouse.

918
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,259
Is this well set today, Britannicus?

919
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,694
At Pharsalia, it was as blunt
as a barrel hoop.

920
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,095
It'll split one of the Egyptian's hairs today,
Caesar.

921
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,497
I've set it myself.

922
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,900
Oh! You're not really going
into battle to be killed?

923
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,371
No, Cleopatra.
No man goes into battle to be killed.

924
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,500
Oh, but they do get killed.
My sister's husband was killed in battle.

925
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,135
You mustn't go.

926
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,113
- Let him go.
- (Caesar, Britannus Laughing)

927
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,241
Please. Please don't go.

928
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,876
What will happen to me
if you never come back?

929
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,388
- Are you afraid?
- No.

930
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,517
Come to the balcony
and you shall see us take the Pharos.

931
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,424
You must learn to look on battles.

932
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,191
Then take me with you.
Let me come with you to the Pharos.

933
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,029
No, no, my child.
You must stay here till I return.

934
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,436
That is well.

935
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,063
- Now, Rufio, march.
- Oh!

936
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,166
- You won't be able to go.
- Why? What now?

937
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,904
They're drying up the harbor with buckets.

938
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,502
A multitude of soldiers. Over there.

939
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,844
They're dipping up the water.

940
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:54,214
This is your accursed clemency, Caesar.
Theodotus has brought them.

941
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,816
I meant him to, Rufio.
They've come to put out the fire.

942
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,294
The library will keep them busy
whilst we seize the lighthouse, eh?

943
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,297
(Chuckles)
More foxing.

944
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,571
Caesar.

945
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:14,769
Cleopatra, if all goes well,
I shall be back this evening.

946
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,817
- (Soldier] All aboard!
- Good-bye!

947
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,355
(Cleopatra)
Good-bye.

948
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,553
(Soldiers]
Hail, Caesar!

949
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,562
Give way there!

950
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,833
Good-bye, my Caesar.
Come back safe.

951
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,203
Good-bye.

952
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,683
(Crowd Chattering)

953
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,168
- (Man) Who goes there, eh?
- (Soldier) Stand!

954
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,535
Who are you?

955
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,040
Centurion, I am Apollodorus the Sicilian.

956
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,237
My calling is to choose beautiful things
for beautiful queens.

957
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,906
Carpets for the queen's apartments
in the palace.

958
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,746
The queen? Oh, yes, yes. Pass him in.

959
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:33,117
Pass all these bazaar people in to the queen
with their goods.

960
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,850
But mind you pass no one out
that you have not passed in...

961
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,791
not even the queen herself.

962
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,954
(Laughing)

963
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,897
I have brought my caravan
past three sentinels...

964
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,833
all so busy staring at the lighthouse
that not one of them challenged me.

965
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,804
- Is this your Roman discipline?
- We're not here to watch the land, but the sea.

966
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,239
Who's this piece of Egyptian crockery?

967
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,572
Apollodorus, rebuke this Roman dog!

968
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:59,136
And bid him bridle his tongue in the presence
of the mistress of the queen's household.

969
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,274
This is a great lady
who stands high with Caesar.

970
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,784
Ftatateeta!

971
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,649
What are you dreaming of?

972
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,950
Ftatateeta!

973
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,218
No, no! You must not come.
There are men here.

974
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,159
- Oh, that ever I was born!
- Ftatateeta, I've thought of something.

975
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,696
- I want a boat at once.
- A boat?

976
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,493
No, no. You cannot.

977
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,763
Apollodorus, speak to the queen.

978
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,338
Beautiful queen.

979
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,374
I am Apollodorus the Sicilian,
your servant from the bazaar.

980
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,637
I have no time for carpets today.
Get me a boat.

981
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,805
You cannot go on the water
except in the royal barge.

982
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,077
Royalty, Ftatateeta, lies not in the barge,
but in the queen.

983
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:39,382
The touch of Your Majesty's foot on
the meanest boat in the harbor will make it royal.

984
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:43,220
Apollodorus, you are my perfect knight,
and I will always buy my carpets through you.

985
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,692
- Can you row?
- My oar shall be Your Majesty's wings.

986
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,263
- Ho there! Boatman.
- Aye.

987
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,423
- Whither shall I row, my queen?
- For the lighthouse. Come.

988
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,296
Stand! You cannot pass.

989
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:56,030
How dare you.
Do you know that I am the queen?

990
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,767
I have my orders. You cannot pass.

991
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,900
Ftatateeta, strangle him.

992
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,500
Keep off there.

993
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,637
Pass on to the palace
and take the queen in with you.

994
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,715
And how if I do neither?

995
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,284
- Then I'll drive this pilum through you.
- At your service, my friend.

996
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,784
Help him. Help him.

997
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,151
I shall not need help, my lady.

998
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,123
What shall it be... sword against pilum
or sword against sword?

999
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:19,285
Roman against Sicilian, curse you.
Take that!

1000
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,662
Help! Help!

1001
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,480
(Soldier Groans)

1002
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,251
(Soldier Groaning)

1003
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:52,853
(Grunts)

1004
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,105
(Ftatateeta)
Thrust your knife into the dog's throat, Apollodorus!

1005
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,334
A curse on you! Let me go!
Ho there, guard! Help! Help!

1006
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,741
Stab the little Roman reptile!
Spit him on your sword.

1007
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,837
What is this? Make your report, soldier.

1008
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,382
This old woman's dangerous.
She's as strong as three men.

1009
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,246
(Ftatateeta]
Centurion, he would have slain the queen.

1010
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,183
(Soldier]
So I would sooner than let her pass.

1011
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,313
Cleopatra, I am loath to offend you,
but without Caesar's express orders...

1012
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,756
I dare not let you pass
beyond the Roman lines.

1013
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,192
You must withdraw into the palace
and examine your carpets there.

1014
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,355
I will not. I am the queen.

1015
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,365
Caesar doesn't speak to me as you do.

1016
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,903
Have Caesar's centurions changed manners
with his scullions?

1017
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,063
I do my duty.
That is enough for me.

1018
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:42,236
Majesty, when a stupid man is doing something
he is ashamed of, he always declares it his duty.

1019
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,643
As for you, Apollodorus,
you may thank the gods...

1020
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,648
you are not nailed to the palace door
with a pilum for your meddling.

1021
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,515
- Is this woman your wife?
- Jupiter, no!

1022
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,886
Not that the lady's not a very striking figure
in her own way...

1023
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,050
but she is not my wife.

1024
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,424
- Roman, I am Ftatateeta, the mistress of...
- Well, keep your hands off my men, mistress...

1025
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,726
or I'll have you pitched into the harbor
though you were as strong as 1 0 men.

1026
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:08,395
We shall see whom Isis loves best...
her servant Ftatateeta or a dog of a Roman.

1027
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,404
Two more men to this post here.

1028
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,168
See that no one leaves the palace
but this man and his merchandise.

1029
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,471
If he draws his sword again, kill him.

1030
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,819
Get about your business.

1031
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,928
(Soldier]
You ought to know better. Off with you.

1032
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,001
(Coins Clinking]

1033
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,138
(Sighs)

1034
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:46,106
Do not tantalize a poor man.

1035
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,245
Pearl of queens, the centurion is still at hand.

1036
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,647
The Roman soldiers are incorruptible...
when their officers are looking.

1037
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,685
I shall have to carry your word to Caesar.

1038
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,721
Are these carpets very heavy?

1039
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,154
It matters not how heavy.
There are plenty of porters.

1040
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,386
How do they put them into the boats?
Do they throw them down?

1041
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,088
Not into the small boats, Majesty.
It would sink them.

1042
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,825
- Not into that man's boat, for instance?
- No, no.

1043
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,560
Too small.

1044
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:16,331
But you can take a carpet
to Caesar in it if I send one?

1045
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,906
Assuredly.

1046
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,340
And you will have it carried gently down the steps
and take great care of it?

1047
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,742
Great, great care?

1048
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,413
More than of my own body.

1049
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:30,110
Good. Come, Ftatateeta.

1050
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,153
No, Apollodorus. You must not come.

1051
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,814
I will choose my carpet myself.
You must wait here.

1052
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,622
- Follow this lady. Obey her.
- This way.

1053
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,561
And take your shoes off
before you put your feet on those stairs!

1054
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:48,199
Listen. Were you sent here to watch me
or watch the Egyptians?

1055
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,933
- We know our duty.
- Well, then why don't you do it? Look!

1056
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,936
(Apollodorus] The Egyptians are moving.
They're going to recapture the Pharos.

1057
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,377
They will attack by land and sea
along the great mole!

1058
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,210
Stir yourselves! The hunt is up!

1059
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,556
(Rufiio]
Centurion, reinforce the platoons on the mole.

1060
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,126
Yes, sir.

1061
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:28,036
Rufio, this has been a mad expedition.
We shall be beaten.

1062
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,438
The Egyptians cannot be such fools...

1063
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:35,847
as not to storm the barricade
and swoop down on us here before it is finished.

1064
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,114
It's the first time I've ever run an avoidable risk.

1065
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,991
- I shouldn't have come to Egypt.
- An hour ago, you were all for victory.

1066
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,029
Yes. I was a fool.

1067
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,428
Rash, Rufio. Boyish.

1068
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,763
Boyish? Not a bit of it.

1069
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,836
Here.

1070
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,371
- What are these for?
- To eat.

1071
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,602
That's what's the matter with you.

1072
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:05,146
When a man comes to your age,
he runs down before the midday meal.

1073
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,442
Go on, eat. And drink.

1074
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,314
Then take another look at our chances.

1075
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,410
My age?

1076
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,421
Yes, I'm an old man.

1077
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,949
Worn out now.
Quite true, Rufio.

1078
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,928
Now, Achillas is still in his prime.

1079
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:26,126
Ptolemy is a boy.

1080
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:29,898
Well, every dog has his day.

1081
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:34,242
I've had mine. I cannot complain.

1082
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,507
These dates are not bad, Rufio.

1083
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,877
That's my old Caesar.

1084
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:43,418
It's a great war...
now we've got rid of the women.

1085
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,226
You again? Keep your distance.

1086
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,764
Come within a yard of me, you old crocodile,
and I'll give you this in your jaw.

1087
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,130
Peace, Roman fellow.
You are now single-handed.

1088
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,967
Apollodorus, this carpet
is Cleopatra's present to Caesar.

1089
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:09,534
It has rolled up in it 1 0 precious goblets
of the thinnest Iberian crystal...

1090
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,546
and a hundred eggs
of the sacred blue pigeon.

1091
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,741
On your honor,
let not one of them be broken.

1092
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,650
On my head be it.
Lay it carefully into the boat.

1093
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:23,657
Those eggs of which the lady speaks
must weigh more than a pound apiece.

1094
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,819
This boat is much too small for such a load.

1095
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,363
- Yes! Yes! Me!
- (All Shouting)

1096
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,762
Mine's bigger yet!

1097
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,733
Oh, thou injurious porter!

1098
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,328
Oh, thou unnatural son of a she-camel!

1099
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,839
My boat can carry five men.

1100
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:43,935
Shall it not carry Your Lordship
and a bale of pigeons' eggs?

1101
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,640
Oh, thou mangy dromedary!

1102
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,809
The gods shall punish thee
for this envious wickedness.

1103
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:53,787
Oh! I cannot quit this bale now to beat thee...

1104
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,381
but, another day, I will lie in wait for thee.

1105
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,393
(Grumbles)

1106
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,429
(Apollodorus]
Peace there, all of you!

1107
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,159
In the name of the gods, Apollodorus,
run no risks with that bale.

1108
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:09,101
Fear not, thou venerable grotesque.
I guess its great worth.

1109
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,537
Into the boat with it gently, my sons,
my children.

1110
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,131
Gently, ye dogs!

1111
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,143
So. 'Tis well.

1112
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,043
Do not step on it! Do not step on it!

1113
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,640
Be not excited, mistress. All is well.

1114
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,549
Oh, thou brute beast.
Thou hast given my heart a turn.

1115
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,214
- Here.
- (Chuckles)

1116
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,292
Ye hungry ones.

1117
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:33,054
- Robber of the poor.
- It's not enough!

1118
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:39,593
Oh! O bounteous prince!

1119
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,602
O lord of the bazaar!

1120
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,604
O favored of the gods!

1121
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:47,506
O father to all porters of the market!

1122
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,444
Farewell, Ftatateeta. I shall be
at the lighthouse before the Egyptians.

1123
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,447
(Ftatateeta]
The gods speed thee.

1124
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,983
Farewell, valiant pilum pitcher.

1125
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:00,284
(Apollodorus)
 My heart, my heart 

1126
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,688
 Spread out thy wings 

1127
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,420
 Spread out thy wings 

1128
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,895
 Shake off thy heavy 

1129
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:14,095
 Load of love 

1130
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,141
Platoon, follow me!

01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,448
(Britannus]
Caesar!

1132
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:32,347
Caesar!

1133
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,480
Caesar, sir.
Our brave mariners have captured a treasure.

1134
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,491
Our enemies are delivered into our hands.

1135
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,891
- In that bag?
- Wait till you hear, Caesar.

1136
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,555
This bag contains all the letters
that have passed between our enemies.

1137
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,566
- Well?
- Well, we shall now know who your foes are.

1138
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,603
The name of every man who's plotted
against you since you crossed the Rubicon...

1139
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,002
may be in these papers, for all we know.

1140
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,097
- Put 'em in the fire.
- Put them...

1141
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,235
In the fiire. Would you have me waste years
of my life condemning men who'll be my friends...

1142
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,338
when I've proved that my friendship
is worth more than that of my enemies?

1143
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,883
But your honor... the honor of Rome.

1144
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,978
I do not make human sacrifices
to my honor as your druids do.

1145
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,717
Since you won't burn them,
at least I can drown them!

1146
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,486
(Water Splashes]

1147
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,496
Caesar, this is mere eccentricity.

1148
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:20,329
Are all traitors to be allowed to go free
for the sake of a... paradox?

1149
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,405
Caesar, when the islander has finished preaching,
call me again.

1150
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,438
O Caesar, my great master...

1151
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,843
if only I could persuade you to regard life seriously,
as men do in my country.

1152
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:35,405
- Do they truly do so, Britannus?
- Have you not been there?
Have you not seen them?

1153
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,543
What Briton speaks as you do
in your moments of levity?

1154
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,885
What Briton neglects to attend
the services at the sacred grove?

1155
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,925
What Briton wears clothes
of many colors as you do...

1156
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,393
instead of... (Chuckles)
plain blue...

1157
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,862
as all solid, well-esteemed men should?

1158
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:53,059
These are moral questions with us.

1159
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,500
Well, well, my friend.
Someday I shall settle down...

1160
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,697
and wear a blue toga perhaps.

1161
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:02,175
Meanwhile, I must get on as best I can
in my fiippant Roman way.

1162
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,938
(Water Splashes]

1163
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,843
What now?

1164
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,547
- Hail!
- What is this? Who are you?

1165
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,986
- How did you come here?
- Calm yourself, my friend.

01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,081
I'm not going to eat you.

1167

Hail, great Caesar!
I am Apollodorus the Sicilian, an artist.

1168

- An artist? A vagabond!
- Peace, man.

1169
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:27,162
Apollodorus is a famous patrician amateur.

1170
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:30,295
I crave the gentleman's pardon.
I understood him to say he was a professional.

1171
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,102
- (Chuckles)
- Welcome, Apollodorus. What is your business?

1172
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,302
First, to deliver to you a present
from the queen of queens.

1173
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,903
- Who is that?
- Cleopatra of Egypt.

1174
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:42,472
Apollodorus, this is no time
for playing with presents.

1175
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,849
Pray you, go back to the queen
and tell her that if all goes well...

1176
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,854
we shall return to the palace this evening.

1177
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,015
Caesar, I cannot return.

1178
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:53,993
As I approached the lighthouse,
some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea.

1179
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:58,499
It broke the nose of my boat. I had hardlly time to get
to the shore before my poor little cockleshell sank.

1180
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,500
I am sorry, Apollodorus.

1181
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:03,435
The fool shall be rebuked.

1182
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:08,068
Well, well. What have you brought me?
The queen will be hurt if I don't look at it.

1183
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,475
Caesar, have we time to waste on this trumpery?

1184
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,447
- The queen's only a child.
- Just so. That's why we mustn't disappoint her.

1185
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,008
Caesar, it's a Persian carpet... a beauty!

1186
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,452
And in it are... so I'm told...

1187
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:24,253
pigeons' eggs and crystal goblets
and fragile, precious things.

1188
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,556
I dare not for my head have it carried up
that narrow ladder from the causeway.

1189
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:30,689
- Swing it up by the crane then!
- The crane?

1190
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,767
(Chuckles)
Caesar.

1191
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,326
I have sworn to tender this bale of carpet
as I tender my own life.

1192
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,998
Then let them swing you up at the same time.

1193
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,201
If the chain breaks,
you and the pigeons' eggs will perish together.

1194
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,575
- Is Caesar serious?
- Well, his manner is frivolous.

1195
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,706
It's because he's an Italian.
But he means what he says.

1196
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,081
Serious or not, he spake well.
Give me a squad of soldiers to work the crane.

1197
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,381
No, no.
It's worked by an elderly Tyrian and his son...

1198
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,457
a well-conducted youth of 1 4.

1199
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,549
What? An old man and a boy work that?

1200
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,254
- Twenty men, you mean.
- No, no. Two only, I assure you.

1201
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:05,094
They have counterweights and a machine
with boiling water, which I don't understand.

1202
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,191
So it isn't of British design.
(Clears Throat)

1203
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:10,931
- Leave the crane to me.
Go and await the descent of the chain.
- (Chuckles) Good.

1204
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:18,245
You will see me presently there,
rising like the sun with my treasure.

1205
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,677
Are you really going to wait here
for this foolery, Caesar?

1206
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:24,775
- Why not?
- The Egyptians will let you know why not...

1207
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,549
if they've got enough sense to make a rush
before our barricade's finished.

1208
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,217
And here we are waiting like children
to see a carpet full of pigeons' eggs.

1209
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,692
Fear not, my son Rufio.

1210
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:38,357
When the first Egyptian takes his first step
along the mole, the alarm will sound...

1211
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,527
and we two will reach the barricade
before the Egyptians.

1212
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:45,937
We two, Rufio...
l, an old man, and you, his biggest boy.

1213
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,669
And the old man will get there first.

1214
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,870
I wish I had some more of those dates.

1215
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,382
Lower away!

1216
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,381
Lower away!

1217
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,601
Easy there!

1218
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:17,905
Further round.

1219
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,738
So! Haul up!

1220
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,515
Gently. Slowly. Slowly. Mind the eggs.

1221
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,024
Slowly. Slowly.

1222
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,570
Haul away!

1223
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,073
Stand off, my friends. Let Caesar see.

1224
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,986
Nothing but a heap of shawls.
Where are the pigeons' eggs?

1225
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,318
Approach, Caesar,
and search for them in the shawls.

1226
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,414
(Gasps)
Treachery! Stand back, Caesar.

1227
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,255
- I saw the shawls move.
There's something alive in there.
- Ooh! It's a serpent.

1228
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,489
Dare Caesar thrust his hand
in where the serpent moves?

1229
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:18,794
- Treacherous dog!
- Peace. Put up your swords.

1230
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,895
Apollodorus, your serpent
seems to breathe very regularly.

1231
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:33,210
Why, this is a pretty little snake.

1232
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,875
- (Laughs)
- Let's have the rest of you.

1233
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,248
Oh! I am smothered.

1234
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,049
Oh, Caesar. A man stood on me in the boat...

1235
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,284
and then... then a great sack of something
fell upon me out of the sky...

1236
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,885
then the boat sank, and then I was
swung up into the air and bumped down.

1237
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,226
Well, never mind.
Here you are, safe and sound at last.

1238
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,165
Aye. And now that she is here,
what are we going to do with her?

1239
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,168
(Britannus]
But, Caesar, this is not proper.

1240
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,762
She cannot stay here
without the companionship of some matron.

1241
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,002
- Shocking!
- Aren't you glad to see me?

1242
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,207
Yes, I'm very glad. But Rufio is very angry,
and Britannus is shocked.

1243
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,545
You can have their heads cut off,
can't you?

1244
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,916
They wouldn't be so useful with their heads cut off
as they are now, my seabird.

1245
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,354
We shall have to go away presently
and cut off some of your Egyptians' heads.

1246
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,120
How will you like being left here
with the chance of being captured...

1247
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,559
by that little brother of yours
if we're beaten, huh?

1248
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,722
You mustn't leave me alone, Caesar.

1249
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,766
You will not leave me alone, will you?

1250
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,301
What? Not when the trumpet sounds
and all our lives...

1251
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,769
depend upon Caesar being at the barricade
before the Egyptians, eh?

1252
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,568
Let them lose their lives.
They are only soldiers.

1253
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,643
Cleopatra...

1254
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,679
when that trumpet sounds,
we must take every man his life in his hands...

1255
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,010
and throw it in the face of Death.

1256
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,141
And of my soldiers who have trusted me...

1257
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:47,312
there's not one whose hand I shall not hold
more sacred than your head.

1258
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,481
Apollodorus, take her back to the palace.

1259
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:53,118
Am I a dolphin, Caesar,
to cross the seas with young ladies on my back?

1260
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,755
My boat is sunk. Yours are either at the barricade
or have returned to the city.

1261
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:59,026
It doesn't matter.

1262
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,034
I will not go back.
(Sobs)

1263
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,229
- Nobody cares for me.
- Oh, Cleopatra.

1264
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,932
You want me to be killed!
(Sobbing)

1265
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:10,239
My poor child, your life matters little here
to anyone but yourself.

1266
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:13,405
** (Horn Blowing]

1267
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,142
Come, Rufio.

1268
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,309
Caesar, do not leave me!

1269
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,319
Caesar, we are cut off.

1270
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,447
The Egyptians have landed from the western harbor
between us and the barricade.

1271
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,458
Rufio, my men at the barricade are lost.
I've murdered them.

1272
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,620
Aye. That's what comes
of fooling with this girl here.

1273
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:45,169
(All Shouting)

1274
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,050
Caesar!

1275
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,855
- Caesar. The Egyptians.
- I know. We must defend ourselves here.

1276
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,486
But I've thrown the ladder into the sea.
They can't get in without it.

1277
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,088
- And we can't get out. Have you thought of that?
- Not get out? Why not?

1278
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,692
- You have ships in the east harbor.
- Our galleys are standing in towards us already.

1279
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,795
And, pray, by what road
are we to walk to the galleys?

1280
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,306
The road that leads everywhere...
the diamond path of the sun and the moon.

1281
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,069
- How far is the nearest galley?
- Fifty fathom.

1282
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,940
No. Nearly a quarter of a mile, Apollodorus.

1283
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,809
- Defend yourselves here
until I send a boat from that galley.
- Have you wings perhaps?

1284
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,474
Water wings, soldier!

1285
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,289
Behold!

1286
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,261
Bravo, Apollodorus! Bravo!

1287
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:37,490
ByJupiter! I will do that too. Britannus.

1288
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,864
- Are you mad? You shall not.
- Why not? Can I not swim as well as he?

1289
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:43,369
- Can an old fool dive and swim like a young one?
- Old?

1290
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,371
Rufio, you forget yourself.

1291
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,499
- (Caesar] I'll race you to the galley
for a week's pay, father Rufiio.
- But me! Me!

1292
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,510
What is to become of me?

1293
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:53,012
I'll carry you on my back
to the galley like a dolphin.

1294
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,309
Rufio, when you see me rise to the surface,
throw her in.

1295
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,284
- No, no, no! I shall be drowned.
- Then in with you after her... both of you!

1296
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,321
Caesar, I am a man and a Briton, not a fish.
I must have a boat.

1297
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,323
- I can't swim.
- Neither can I.

1298
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,325
Stay here, then, Britannus,
until I recapture the lighthouse.

1299
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:08,590
- I'll not forget you. Now, Rufio.
- Have you made up your mind to this folly?

1300
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,257
The Egyptians have made it up for me.
And mind where you jump.

1301
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,062
I don't want you in the small of my back
as I come up.

1302
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,069
One last word, Caesar.

1303
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,140
Do not let yourself be seen
in the more fashionable part of Alexandria...

1304
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:21,209
until you've changed your clothes.

1305
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:22,776
Ho, Apollodorus!

1306
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,176
The white upon the blue above-

1307
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,475
Is purple on the green below!

1308
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,817
Let me see. Let me see!
He will be drowned.

1309
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:36,584
Oh! Aaah!
(Screams)

1310
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,255
(Both Laughing)

1311
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:45,265
He's got her!

1312
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,267
(Shouting)

1313
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:50,998
Hold the fort, Briton.
Caesar will not forget you.

1314
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:00,607
Hip, hip, hip hooray!

1315
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:03,684
Hip... Hooray!

1316
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,130
(People Chattering]

1317
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,135
(Man)
Ah. Another royal banquet?

1318
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,137
In Caesar's honor.

1319
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,139
These Romans are magicians.

1320
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,641
For six months, a mere handful of them
have held the palace...

1321
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,643
against the whole of Egypt's armed forces.

1322
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,838
And look at their escape from the Pharos.

1323
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,917
Who but a magician
could swim like a dolphin at Caesar's age...

1324
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,917
carrying the queen on his back?

1325
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,919
That might be the queen's magic.

1326
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:43,855
She rides on Caesar's back on land now
as on the sea!

1327
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,927

1328
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,393

You laugh.

1332
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:08,905
But take care. Take care.

1333
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:13,386
I will find out someday
how to make myself served as Caesar is served.

1334

- Old hooknose!

1335
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:18,157
Silence!

1336

Do you know why...

1337
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:24,832
I allow you all to chatter impertinently
just as you please...

1338
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:28,528
instead of treating you as Ftatateeta
would treat you if she were queen?

1339
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:31,104
Because you try to imitate Caesar
in everything...

1340
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:34,141
and he lets everyone say
what they please to him.

1341
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,142
- (All Giggle)
- No.

1342
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:39,577
But because I asked him one day
why he did so...

1343
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:44,448
and he said, "Let your women talk,
and you will learn something from them."

1344
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,112
"What have I to learn from them?"
I said.

1345
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,884
"What they are," said he.

1346
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:54,052
And, oh, you should have
seen his eyes as he said it.

1347
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,063
You would have curled up,
you shallow things.

1348
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:59,065
- (All Giggle)
- At whom are you laughing?

1349
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,625
- At me or at Caesar?
- At Caesar.

1350
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:05,900
If you were not a fool, you would laugh at me.

1351
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:09,238
And if you were not a coward,
you would not be afraid to tell me so.

1352
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:13,576
Heigh-ho.
I wish Caesar were back in Rome.

1353
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:16,912
It will be a bad day for you when he goes.

1354
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:21,614
Oh, if I were not ashamed to let him see
that I am as cruel at heart as my father...

1355
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,817
I would make you repent that speech.

1356
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,826
Why do you wish him away?

1357
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:32,059
He makes you so terribly prosy and serious
and learned and philosophical.

1358
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:36,103
- It's worse than being religious at our ages.

Cease this endless cackling, will you!
Hold your tongues.

01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,406
Well, well. We must try and live up to Caesar.

Pothinus craves the ear of the queen.

1363
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:50,774
I suppose he has bribed you to admit him to me?

1364
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:55,083
- Not by my father's gods.
- Have I not told you not to deny things?

1365
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,353
You all sell audiences to the queen...

1366
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,554
as if I saw whom you please
and not whom I please.

- Go, take the bribe and bring in Pothinus.

with my own hands.

Caesar loves music.
Can you teach me?

1372
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,463
Assuredly.

1373

I and no one else can teach the queen.

- All other teachers are quacks.

Good. You shall teach me.
How long will it take?

1377
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,472
Not very long. Only four years.

1378

Your Majesty must first become proficient
in the philosophy of Pythagoras. And then...

1379

Has she become proficient
in the philosophy of Pythagoras?

Oh, she is but a slave.

01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:09,521
Well, then, I will learn as a dog learns,
for she plays better than you.

1383
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,191
You shall give me a lesson
every day for a fortnight.

After that, whenever I strike a false note,
you shall be fiogged.

that there is no time to fiog you...

you shall be thrown into the Nile

Well, Pothinus, what is the latest news
from your rebel friends?

01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,095

than Caesar is.

in the palace by my subjects.

- That Cleopatra is no longer a child.

a... a "new woman."

Now, Pothinus...

1417
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:15,718
why did you bribe Ftatateeta
to bring you hither?

Cleopatra, what they tell me is true.
You are changed.

Do you speak with Caesar every day
for six months, and you will be changed.

It is common talk that you are
infatuated with this old man.

1421

"Infatuated"? What does that mean?

1422
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,873
"Made foolish," is it not?

1423
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,875
Oh, no. I wish I were.

1424
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,378
Wish that you were made foolish?
How so?

1425
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,847
When I was foolish, I did what I liked.

1426
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,975
Now that Caesar has made me wise...

1427
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,577
it is no use my liking or disliking.

1428
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:51,056
I do what must be done
and have no time to attend to myself.

1429
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,059
This is not happiness...

1430
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,493
but it is greatness.

1431
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,087
I think if Caesar were gone...

1432
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,565
I could govern the Egyptians.

1433
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,000
Cleopatra...

1434
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,038
this may be the vanity of youth.

1435
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:09,667
No, no. It is not that I am so clever,
but that the others are so stupid.

1436
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:12,337
Truly that is the great secret.

1437
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,439
Now, tell me what you came to say.

1438
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,883
- I? Nothing.
- Nothing?

1439
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:23,389
At least to beg for my liberty. That is all.

1440
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,516
For that, you would have knelt to Caesar.

1441
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,890
No, Pothinus.

1442
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:32,932
You came with some plan that depended on
Cleopatra being a little nursery kitten.

1443
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,367
Now that Cleopatra is a queen,
your plan is upset.

1444
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:41,932
Is Cleopatra then indeed a queen
and no longer Caesar's prisoner and slave?

1445
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,069
Pothinus, we are all Caesar's slaves...

1446
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,580
all we in this land of Egypt...
whether we will or no.

1447
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,651
And she who is wise enough to know this...

1448
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,346
will reign when Caesar departs.

1449
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,649
You harp on Caesar's departure.

1450
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:59,488
- What if I do?
- Does he not love you?

1451
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:03,894
Love me? Pothinus, Caesar loves no one.

1452
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:07,559
He makes friends with everyone
as he does with dogs and children.

1453
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:10,364
His kindness to me is a wonder.

1454
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:14,805
Neither mother, father nor nurse
have ever taken so much care of me...

1455
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,673
or thrown open their thoughts to me so freely.

1456
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:26,411
But how can you be sure that he does not
love you as men love women?

1457
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,421
Because I cannot make him jealous.

1458
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,423
- I have tried.
- (Chuckles)

1459
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,823
Perhaps I should have asked, then,
do you love him?

1460
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,725
Can one love a god?

1461
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:38,697
Besides, I love another Roman.

1462
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,166
No god, but a man.

1463
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,294
One who can love and hate.

1464
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:46,430
And one whom I can hurt
and would hurt me.

1465
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,374
Does Caesar know this?

1466
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,037
- Yes.
- And he is not angry?

1467
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:55,547
He promises to send him to Egypt to please me.

1468
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,982
I do not understand this man.

1469
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:00,349
You understand Caesar?

1470
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,923
How could you?

1471
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,652
I do, by instinct.

1472
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,320
Your Majesty caused me to be admitted today.

1473
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:10,659
- What message has the queen for me?
- This.

1474
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,166
You think that by making my brother king,
you will rule in Egypt...

1475
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:16,793
because you are his guardian
and he is a little silly.

1476
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:20,863
- The queen is pleased to say so.
- The queen is pleased to say this also:

1477
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,739
Caesar will eat up you...
and Achillas and my brother...

1478
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,006
as a cat eats up mice.

1479
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:30,413
And he will put on this land of Egypt
as a shepherd puts on his garment.

1480
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:33,453
And when he has done that,
he will return to Rome...

1481
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:36,182
and leave Cleopatra here as his viceroy.

1482
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:39,817
That he shall never do!
We have a thousand men to his 1 0.

1483
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:42,657
And we shall drive him
and his beggarly legions into the sea.

1484
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,230
You rant like any common fellow.

1485
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,130
- Cleopatra...
- Enough, enough! Ftatateeta.

1486
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:50,568
Caesar has spoiled me
for talking to weak things like you.

1487
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,972
I know to whom I must go now.

1488
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,775
- Let me go forth from this hateful place.
- What angers you?

1489
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,077
The curse of all the gods of Egypt be upon her.

1490
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:07,086
She has sold her country to the Roman
that she may buy it back from him with her kisses.

1491
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,782
Fool. Did she not tell you
that she would have Caesar gone?

1492
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,381
You listened?

1493
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,689
I took care that some honest woman
should be at hand whilst you were with her.

1494
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:17,059
Mark this, mistress.
You thought, before Caesar came...

1495
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,497
that Egypt should presently be ruled
by you and your crew in the name of Cleopatra.

1496
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:24,503
- I set myself against it.
- Aye! That it might be ruled by you and your crew
in the name of Ptolemy.

1497
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:27,233
Well, better me, or even you,
than a woman with a Roman heart...

1498
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,775
- And that is what Cleopatra is now become.
- (Scoffs)

1499
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,539
Whilst I live, she shall never rule.

1500
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,081
So guide yourself accordingly.

1501
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:46,660
(No Audible Dialogue)

1502
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,796
Wait here.

1503
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,890
Here, Your Excellency.

1504
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,369
The Roman commander
will await Caesar here.

1505
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:06,436
Hmm. Ah.

1506
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,374
(Sighs)

1507
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:15,512
That was a climb. (Sighs)
How high have we come?

1508
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:18,057
We are on the palace roof,
O beloved of Victory.

1509
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,356
Good. Then the beloved of Victory
has no more stairs to get up.

1510
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,555
Caesar approaches.

1511
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:32,505
Why, Rufio...

1512
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,507
a new baldric.

1513
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,577
A new golden pommel to your sword.

1514
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:42,142
And you've had your hair cut.

1515
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:45,948
Oh, but not your beard. Impossible.

1516
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:49,489
(Sniffs)
Perfumed. ByJupiter Olympus.

1517
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,286
Well, is it to please myself?

1518
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:56,227
No, Rufio, my son, but to please me.
To celebrate my birthday.

1519
01:33:56,330 --> 01:34:00,960
Your birthday. You always have a birthday
when there's a pretty girl to be fiattered...

1520
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:03,298
or an ambassador to be conciliated.

1521
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:06,896
- Rufio.
- Well, we had seven of them in 1 0 months last year.

1522
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:10,375
Alas, Rufio, I shall never break myself
of these petty deceits.

1523
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,378
Have you noticed I'm before my time?

1524
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,574
Ah? I thought that meant something.

1525
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,447
- What is it?
- Pothinus wants to speak to you.

1526
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:23,649
I advise you to see him. There's some
plotting going on here among the women.

1527
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:26,727
Who is Pothi... Oh, yes.

1528
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:28,727
- Has he not escaped?
- No.

1529
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,764
Why not? Have I not told you
always to let prisoners escape...

1530
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:33,925
unless there are special orders
to the contrary?

1531
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:36,026
Are there not enough
mouths to be fed without his?

1532
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:40,437
Yes. And if you'd have a little sense
and let me cut his throat, you'd save his rations.

1533
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:45,342
Anyway, he won't escape.
He prefers to stay and spy on us.

1534
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:48,472
- And you want me to see him.
- Oh, I don't want anything.

1535
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:52,040
I daresay you'll do what you like.
Don't put it on me.

1536
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:54,121
Well, well.

1537
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,287
Let's have him in.

1538
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,065
Ho there, guard!
Release your man and send him up.

1539
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:22,248
- Who's to dine with us besides Cleopatra?
- Apollodorus the Sicilian.

1540
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:26,251
- Oh, that popinjay.
- Come. The popinjay is an amusing dog...

1541
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:30,380
tells a story, sings a song
and saves us the trouble of fiattering the queen.

1542
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:33,289
Well, he can swim a bit and fence a bit.
He might be worse.

1543
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:37,455
- If only he knew how to hold his tongue.
- The gods forbid he should ever learn.

1544
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,533
Ah. Pothinus.

1545
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:43,091
You're welcome.
What's the news this afternoon?

1546
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:47,834
Caesar, I come to warn you of a danger
and to make you an offer.

1547
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:51,810
- Never mind the danger. Make the offer.
- Never mind the offer. What's the danger?

1548
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:55,678
Caesar, you think that Cleopatra
is devoted to you.

1549
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:58,980
My friend, I already know what I think.

1550
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:02,146
- Come to your offer.
- I will deal plainly.

1551
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:05,020
I know not by what magic...

1552
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:08,357
you have been enabled
to defend the palace...

1553
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:11,829
and a few yards of beach
against a city and an army...

1554
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:15,231
but we know now
that your gods are irresistible...

1555
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:17,964
and that you are a worker of miracles.

1556
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:21,041
- I no longer threaten you.
- (Laughs) Very handsome of you indeed.

1557
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,042
So be it, you are the master.

1558
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,840
Yes, yes, my friend. But what then?

1559
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,779
Spit it out, man. What have you to say?

1560
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:31,317
I have to say that you have
a traitoress in your camp.

1561
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,318
- Cleopatra...
- The queen!

1562
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,945
Should have spat it out sooner, you fool.
Now it's too late.

1563
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:40,925
- What is he doing here?
- Just going to tell me something about you.

1564
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,364
You shall hear it.

1565
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,040
Proceed, Pothinus.

1566
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:57,734
- I... Caesar...
- Out with it.

1567
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:01,747
What I have to say is for your ears,
not for the queen's.

1568
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:05,376
There are means of making you speak.
Take care.

1569
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,954
Caesar does not employ those means.

1570
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:11,582
My dear, when a man has anything
to tell in this world...

1571
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:16,459
the difficulty is not to make him tell it
but to prevent him from telling it too often.

1572
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:20,364
Let me celebrate my birthday
by setting you free.

1573
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,401
Farewell. We shall not meet again.

1574
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,596
Caesar, this mercy is foolish.

1575
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:26,764
Will you not give me a private audience?

1576
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:28,774
Your life may depend on it.

1577
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:31,003
Ho there, guard! Pass the prisoner out.
He's released.

1578
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:34,308
Now off with you. You've lost your chance.

1579
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:38,083
I will speak.

1580
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,847
You see? Torture wouldn't have
wrung a word from him.

1581
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:44,789
Caesar, you have taught Cleopatra the arts
by which the Romans govern the world.

1582
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:48,328
Alas, my friend,
they cannot even govern themselves. What then?

1583
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:50,954
What then?
Are you so besotted with her beauty...

1584
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,898
that you do not see that
she is impatient to reign in Egypt alone...

1585
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,935
and that her heart is set on your departure?

1586
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:59,005
- Liar!
- What? Protestations?

1587
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:00,971
Contradictions?

1588
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:03,976
No, I do not deign to contradict.

1589
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:06,774
- Let him talk.
- From her own lips I have heard it.

1590
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,543
You are to be her cat's-paw.
You are to tear the crown...

1591
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,675
from her brother's head and set it on her own...

1592
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,685
delivering us all into her hand.

1593
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:17,416
Delivering yourself also.
And then Caesar can return to Rome.

1594
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:21,654
Or depart through the gate of death,
which is nearer and surer.

1595
01:38:21,762 --> 01:38:24,128
Well, and is not this very natural?

1596
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:27,598
Natural? Then you do not resent treachery?

1597
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:31,660
Resent? O thou foolish Egyptian.
What have I to do with resentment?

1598
01:38:31,772 --> 01:38:34,434
Do I resent the wind when it chills me...

1599
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,941
or the night when it makes me
stumble in the darkness?

1600
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:40,673
To tell me such a story as this
is to tell me that the sun will rise tomorrow.

1601
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:42,715
But it is false, false! I swear it!

1602
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:47,947
It is true, though you swore it a thousand times
and believed all you swore.

1603
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,692
Come, Rufio. Let us see Pothinus past the guard.
I have a word to say to him.

1604
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,800
I must give the queen a moment
to recover herself.

1605
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,128
Tell your friends, Pothinus, they mustn't think...

1606
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:07,901
I'm opposed to a reasonable settlement
of the country's affairs.

1607
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:10,636
Ftatateeta. Ftatateeta!

1608
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:13,144
- Peace, child. Be comforted.
- Can they hear us?

1609
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:15,181
No, dear heart. No.

1610
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:18,080
If he leaves the palace alive,
never see my face again.

1611
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:21,552
- He? Pothinus?
- Strike out his life as I strike his name from your lips!

1612
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:25,751
Dash him down from the wall.
Break him on the stones. Kill, kill, kill him.

1613
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:27,827
The dog shall perish.

1614
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:31,295
Fail in this, and you go out
from before me forever.

1615
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:33,366
So be it.

1616
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:36,368
You shall not see my face
until his eyes are darkened.

1617
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,997
Come soon. Soon.

1618
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:44,275
As the light dies...

1619
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,346
he shall die.

1620
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:51,114
(Laughter]

1621
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:54,813
So you've come back to me, Caesar.
I thought you were angry.

1622
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:57,049
Welcome, Apollodorus.

1623
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:59,887
Cleopatra grows more womanly beautiful
from week to week.

1624
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,690
- Truth, Apollodorus?
- Far, far short of the truth.

1625
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,765
Friend Rufio threw a pearl into the sea.
Caesar fished up a diamond.

1626
01:40:05,866 --> 01:40:08,426
Caesar fished up a touch of rheumatism.
Come on. To dinner.

1627
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:10,435
(Cleopatra)
Yes. To dinner!

1628
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:13,267
- I've ordered such a dinner for you, Caesar.
- What are we to have?

1629
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,706
- Peacocks' brains.
- Peacocks' brains, Apollodorus.

1630
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:18,972
- Not for me. I prefer nightingales' tongues.
- Roast boar, Rufio.

1631
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:22,048
- Ah! Good!
- What has become of my leathern cushion?

1632
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,083
I've got new ones for you, Caesar.

1633
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:27,551
These cushions, Caesar, are of Maltese gauze,
stuffed with rose leaves.

1634
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:31,351
- Rose leaves? Am I a caterpillar?
- Oh, what a shame. My new cushions.

1635
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,824
What shall we serve to whet Caesar's appetite?

1636
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,827
- Any oysters?
- Assuredly.

1637
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:38,363
- British oysters?
- British oysters, of course.

1638
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:40,729
- Oysters then.
- Sea hedgehogs for me.

1639
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:42,631
Have we nothing solid to begin with?

1640
01:40:42,736 --> 01:40:45,466
- Fieldfares with asparagus.
- Fattened fowls, Rufio.

1641
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:48,598
- Have some fattened fowls.
- Aye! That'll do.

1642
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,700
(Cleopatra]
Fieldfares for me.

1643
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:54,770
Caesar will deign to choose his wine?
Sicilian, Tuscan, Macedonian, Chianti-

1644
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,476
- (Rufiio] All Greek.
- Try the Sicilian, Caesar.

1645
01:40:57,584 --> 01:40:59,484
Bring me my barley water.

1646
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:02,350
(Groans)
Bring me my Falernian.

1647
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:07,223
It's a waste of time giving you dinner, Caesar.
My scullions would not condescend to your diet.

1648
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,261
Well, well. Let's try the Falernian.

1649
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:13,129
But when I return to Rome,
I shall make laws against these extravagances.

1650
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:16,202
- I will even get the laws carried out.
- Never mind.

1651
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:18,237
Today you are to be like other people...

1652
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:21,739
idle, luxurious and kind.

1653
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:25,209
Well, well.
For once, I will sacrifice my comfort.

1654
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:31,149
There. So now are you satisfied?

1655
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:37,153
- ** (Woman Vocalizing]
- (Laughter]

1656
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:40,784
(Cleopatra] And you no longer believe
I long for your departure for Rome?

1657
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:43,089
I no longer believe anything.

1658
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:45,461
My brains are asleep.

1659
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:52,664
Besides, who knows
whether I shall return to Rome?

1660
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:56,539
- How? Huh? What?
- One year of Rome is like another...

1661
01:41:56,643 --> 01:41:58,543
except that I grow older.

1662
01:41:58,645 --> 01:42:02,172
It's no better here in Egypt.
The old men, when they're tired of life, say...

1663
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:04,842
"We have seen everything
except the source of the Nile."

1664
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:07,011
Why not see that?

1665
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,021
Cleopatra...

1666
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:12,183
will you come with me
and track the fiood to its cradle...

1667
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:14,852
in the heart of the regions of mystery?

1668
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:17,897
Shall I make you a new kingdom
and build you a holy city...

1669
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:19,932
there in the great unknown?

1670
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:21,933
Yes, yes. You shall.

1671
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:26,335
Now he'll conquer Africa with two legions
before I finish the roast boar.

1672
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,273
No scoffiirg. This is a noble scheme.

1673
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,743
Come. Let's name the holy city
and consecrate it with Sicilian wine.

1674
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:35,974
Cleopatra shall name it herself.

1675
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:38,142
It shall be called...

1676
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:40,720
Caesar's Gift to His Beloved.

1677
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:46,555
No, no. Something vaster than that.
Something universal, like the starry firmament.

1678
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,925
Why not simply The Cradle of the Nile?

1679
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:53,227
No. The Nile is my ancestor, and he's a god.

1680
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:55,358
Oh, I've just thought of something.

1681
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:57,767
The Nile shall name it himself.

1682
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:00,465
Let us call upon him all together.
Send for him.

1683
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:05,404
- Away with all of you.
- (Stops)

1684
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:37,008
Go. I am a priestess and have power
to take your charge from you.

1685
01:43:38,178 --> 01:43:40,646
What hocus-pocus is this?

1686
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:42,977
'Tis not hocus-pocus.

1687
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:47,144
To do it properly,
we should kill something to please him.

1688
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:50,917
But perhaps he will answer Caesar without that
if we spill some wine to him.

1689
01:43:51,024 --> 01:43:55,484
- Why not call on our hawk-headed friend there?
- Shh! He will hear you and be angry.

1690
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:58,087
The source of the Nile is not in his district, I expect.

1691
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:01,827
Now let us call on the Nile all together.

1692
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:06,872
You must say with me
"Send us thy voice, Father Nile."

1693
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:11,905
Send us thy voice, Father Nile.

1694

(Pothinus Groans]

1695
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,316
What was that?

1696
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:21,717
- What was that?
- It is nothing. They are beating some slave.

1697
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,120
Nothing?

1698
01:44:24,224 --> 01:44:27,523
- A man with a knife in him, I'll swear.
- A murder?

1699
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:30,495
- (Thud In Distance]
- Shh! Silence. Did you hear that?

1700
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:32,531
Another cry?

1701
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:34,965
No. A thud. Something fell, I think.

1702
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:37,366
Something with bones in it, huh?

1703
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:40,167
- Rufio...
- Will you leave me, Caesar?

1704
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:43,766
- Apollodorus, are you going?
- Faith, dearest queen. My appetite is gone.

1705
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:46,368
Apollodorus, go down to the courtyard.
Find out what has happened.

1706
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,176
Your soldiers have killed somebody perhaps.
What does it matter?

1707
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,251
This must be seen to.

1708
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:10,061
- Is she drunk?
- Not with wine.

1709
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:28,547
The queen looks again on the face of her servant.

1710
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:39,225
There's some mischief between those two.

1711
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:50,768
Cleopatra, what has happened?

1712
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:53,641
Nothing, dearest Caesar. Nothing.
I am innocent.

1713
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:56,773
Dearest Caesar, are you angry with me?

1714
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,783
Why do you look at me so?

1715
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:02,082
I have been here with you all the time.
How could I know what has happened?

1716
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,623
- That is true.
- Of course it is true.

1717
01:46:04,725 --> 01:46:06,625
You know it is true, Rufio.

1718
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:09,958
I shall know presently.

1719
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:14,090
Caesar, remember,
your bodyguard is within call.

1720
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:19,632
Why do you allow Rufio to speak to me so?
You should teach him his place.

1721
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:23,767
Teach him to be my enemy and to hide his thoughts
from me as you are now hiding yours.

1722
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:29,008
Why do you say that, Caesar?
Indeed, indeed, I am not hiding anything.

1723
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:31,277
You are wrong to treat me like this!

1724
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:36,186
I am only a child, and you turn into stone
because you think someone has been killed.

1725
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:38,257
I can't bear it.

1726
01:46:38,358 --> 01:46:40,758
(Sobs)

1727
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:44,024
But there. I know you hate tears.

1728

You shall not be troubled with them.

1729
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,130
Only, I am so silly.

1730
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,933
I cannot help being hurt when you speak coldly.

1731
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:57,339
Of course you are quite right.
It is dreadful to think of anyone being killed...

1732
01:46:57,444 --> 01:47:00,936
or even hurt, and I hope nothing really serious...

1733
01:47:01,047 --> 01:47:03,345

I know that.

They're for tearing the palace down
and driving us into the sea straightaway.

- We laid hold of this renegade
as we were clearing them out of the courtyard.
- Release him.

What has offended the citizens, Lucius Septimius?

1745
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:51,194
What did you expect, Caesar?
Pothinus was a favorite of theirs.

1746
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:55,598
What has happened to Pothinus? I set him free here
but an hour ago. Did they not pass him out?

1747
01:47:55,702 --> 01:48:01,641
Aye. Through the gallery arch, 60 feet
above ground, with three inches of steel in his ribs.

1748
01:48:01,741 --> 01:48:03,936
He is as dead as Pompey.

1749
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:08,744
We are quits now as to killing,
you and I.

and a friend of yours.

Rufio said I did well.
Now the others shall judge of me too.

1760

This Pothinus sought to make me conspire
with him to betray Caesar. I refused.

1761
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:49,549
And he cursed me and came privily to Caesar
to accuse me ofhis own treachery.

1762
01:48:49,656 --> 01:48:51,886
He insulted me.

1763
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:55,553
Me, the queen, to my face.

1764
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:59,996
Caesar would not avenge me.
He spoke him fair and set him free.

1765
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:04,298
Was I right to avenge myself?
Speak, Lucius.

1766
01:49:04,404 --> 01:49:08,135
I do not gainsay it,
but you'll get little thanks for it from Caesar.

I have but one word of blame, most beautiful.

You should have called on me, your knight,
and in fair duel, I should have slain the slanderer.

I will be judged by your very slave, Caesar.

and disloyalty left unpunished...

at the gate all these months?

but we have served you faithfully.

1812
01:51:44,397 --> 01:51:47,127
Alas, Rufio, my son...

1813
01:51:47,233 --> 01:51:49,895
as dogs, we are like to perish now in the streets.

1814
01:51:50,003 --> 01:51:52,870
Caesar, what you say has an Olympian ring in it...

1815
01:51:52,972 --> 01:51:54,906
but I'm still on the side of Cleopatra.

1816
01:51:55,008 --> 01:51:59,638
If we must die, she shall not want the devotion
of a man's heart or the strength of a man's arm.

1817
01:51:59,746 --> 01:52:03,204
- But I do not want to die.
- Oh, ignoble.

1818
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:06,114
- Ignoble.

Hearken to me, Caesar.

1820
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:13,320
It may be ignoble,
but l, too, mean to live as long as I can.

1821
01:52:13,426 --> 01:52:17,157
- Well, my friend, you are likely to outlive Caesar.
- Does Caesar despair?

1822
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:21,563
He who has never hoped can never despair.

1823
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:24,535
Caesar, in good or bad fortune,
looks his fate in the face.

1824
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:27,697
Look it in the face now,
and it will smile as it always has to Caesar.

1825
01:52:27,807 --> 01:52:30,332
- You presume to encourage me?
- I offer you my services.

1826
01:52:30,443 --> 01:52:33,037
- I will change sides if you will have me.
- What? At this point?

1827
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:36,809
- At this point.
- Do you suppose Caesar is mad? To trust you?

1828
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:41,285
I do not ask him to trust me until he is victorious.
I ask for my life and a command in Caesar's army.

1829
01:52:41,387 --> 01:52:44,788
And since Caesar is a fair dealer,
I will pay in advance.

1830
01:52:44,891 --> 01:52:47,792
- Pay? How?
- With a piece of good news for you.

1831
01:52:47,894 --> 01:52:50,055
- What news?
- "What news?"

1832
01:52:50,163 --> 01:52:52,631
What news, did you say, my son Rufio?

1833
01:52:52,732 --> 01:52:56,293
The relief has arrived.
Mithridates of Pergamus is on the march.

1834
01:52:56,402 --> 01:52:58,836
- Is it not so, Lucius Septimius?
- He has taken Pelusium.

1835
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:01,372
Lucius, you are henceforth my officer.

1836
01:53:01,474 --> 01:53:04,204
Rufio, the Egyptians must have sent
every soldier from the city...

1837
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,471
to prevent Mithridates crossing the Nile.

1838
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:08,945
There is nothing in the streets now but mob. Mob!

1839
01:53:09,048 --> 01:53:13,246
It is so. Mithridates is marching by the great
road to Memphis to cross above the delta.

1840
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:16,652
- Achillas will fight him there.
- Achillas shall fight Caesar there.

- Here is the palace.
- Mm-hmm.

Here is the theater.

1845
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:32,671
Now, you take 20 men
and pretend to go by this street.

1846
01:53:32,772 --> 01:53:36,037
And whilst they're stoning you,
out will come the cohorts by this and this.

1847
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,542
- My streets are right, are they, Lucius?
- Aye. That's the fig market.

Yes. I saw on the day we arrived.
Britannus, tell Petronius that within an hour...

1849
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:43,773
half our forces must take ship
for the western lake.

1850
01:53:43,883 --> 01:53:45,783
And see to my horse and armor.

1851
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:50,015
With the rest, I shall march round the lake
and up the Nile and catch Achillas in the desert.

1852
01:53:50,123 --> 01:53:52,318
Lucius, give the word to start.

1853
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:55,986
Apollodorus, lend me your sword
and your right arm for this campaign.

- Aye. And my heart and life to boot.
- I accept both.

- Are you ready?
- Ready for art... the art of war!

- Come! This is something like business.
- Is it not, my only son?

into the battle of the delta...

cross the canal with us when we stormed the camp?

Egypt must pay her tribute to Rome in art.

Caesar, I'm loath to let you go back to Rome
without your shield.

- It matters not.

I should never have forgiven myself.

He who is to rule in Caesar's name,
in Caesar's way...

1975
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:05,636
according to Caesar's boasted laws of life.

1976
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:09,671
He is to rule as he can, Cleopatra.
He has taken the work upon him...

1977
02:03:09,782 --> 02:03:11,773
and will do it in his own way.

1978
02:03:11,884 --> 02:03:16,787
Not in your way then... without punishment,
without revenge, without judgment?

1979
02:03:16,889 --> 02:03:21,019
Ah, that is the right way, the great way,
the only possible way in the end.

1980
02:03:21,127 --> 02:03:23,459
Believe it, Rufio, if you can.

1981
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:25,462
Why, I believe it, Caesar, but look you.

1982
02:03:25,564 --> 02:03:28,260
Cleopatra had a tigress
that killed men at her bidding.

1983
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:30,892
I thought she might bid it kill you someday.

1984
02:03:31,003 --> 02:03:33,836
So, without malice, I only cut its throat.

1985
02:03:33,939 --> 02:03:36,032
That's why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning.

1986
02:03:36,142 --> 02:03:38,804
He has shed the blood of my servant Ftatateeta.

1987
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:44,106
Upon your head be it, Caesar, as upon his,
if you hold him free of it.

1988
02:03:44,216 --> 02:03:47,549
On my head be it, then,
for it was well done, Rufio.

1989
02:03:47,653 --> 02:03:50,247
Come. Don't be angry with me.

1990
02:03:50,356 --> 02:03:52,847
- I'm sorry for that poor Totateeta.
- (Chuckling)

1991
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:54,926
Ah. You're laughing.

1992
02:03:56,061 --> 02:03:59,292
- Does that mean reconciliation?
- No, no, no.

1993
02:03:59,398 --> 02:04:02,367
Only it is so ridiculous to hear you
call her Totateeta.

1994
02:04:02,468 --> 02:04:04,732
As much a child as ever, Cleopatra.

1995
02:04:04,837 --> 02:04:07,101
Haven't I made a woman of you after all?

1996
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:09,367
Oh, it is you who are a great baby.

1997
02:04:09,475 --> 02:04:12,740
You make me seem silly
because you will not behave seriously.

1998
02:04:12,845 --> 02:04:15,336
But you have treated me badly,
and I do not forgive you.

1999
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,417
- Bid me farewell.
- I will not.

2000
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:21,577
I will send you a beautiful present from Rome.

2001
02:04:21,687 --> 02:04:24,247
Beauty from Rome to Egypt indeed.

2002
02:04:24,356 --> 02:04:26,551
What can Rome give me
that Egypt cannot give me?

2003
02:04:26,659 --> 02:04:29,787
That's true, Caesar.
If the present is to be really beautiful...

2004
02:04:29,895 --> 02:04:31,988
I shall have to buy it for you in Alexandria.

2005
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:35,294
You're forgetting the treasures
for which Rome is most famous, my friend.

2006
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:37,335
You cannot buy them in Alexandria.

2007
02:04:37,436 --> 02:04:40,837
- What are they, Caesar?
- Her sons.

2008
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:44,103
Come, Cleopatra.
Forgive me and bid me farewell...

2009
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:47,008
and I will send you a man.

2010
02:04:47,112 --> 02:04:49,046
Not old and ripe for the knife.

2011
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:51,878
Not hiding a bald head
under his conqueror's laurels.

2012
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:54,384
Not stooped with the weight of the world
on his shoulders...

2013
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:56,978
but brisk and fresh and strong and young...

2014
02:04:57,089 --> 02:05:00,752
hoping in the morning,
fighting in the day and reveling in the evening.

2015
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:03,351
Will you take such an one in exchange for Caesar?

2016
02:05:03,462 --> 02:05:05,020
His name? His name?

2017
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:09,123
- Shall it be Mark Antony?
- (Squeals)

2018
02:05:09,235 --> 02:05:11,726
(Chuckles)
You're a bad hand at a bargain, mistress...

2019
02:05:11,837 --> 02:05:13,737
if you'll swap Caesar for Antony.

2020
02:05:15,241 --> 02:05:17,175
So now are you satisfied?

2021
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:21,110
- You will not forget?
- I will not forget.

2022
02:05:21,213 --> 02:05:23,181
Farewell.

2023
02:05:23,282 --> 02:05:26,012
I do not think we shall meet again.

2024
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:42,566
Hail and farewell!

2025
02:05:42,668 --> 02:05:44,727
Hail, Caesar, and farewell!

2026
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:49,365
(All)
Hail, Caesar, and farewell!

2027
02:05:53,612 --> 02:05:56,479
- (Sniffies)
- Oh, no tears, dearest queen.

2028
02:05:56,582 --> 02:05:59,380
They stab your servant to the heart.

2029
02:05:59,485 --> 02:06:03,512
- He will return someday.
- I hope not.

2030
02:06:03,622 --> 02:06:05,749
But I can't help crying...

2031
02:06:05,858 --> 02:06:07,792
just the same.

2032
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:18,860
(Crowd)
Hail, Caesar, and farewell!
