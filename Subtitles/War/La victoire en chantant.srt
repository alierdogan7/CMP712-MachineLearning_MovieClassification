2
00:00:12,824 --> 00:01:54,923
[ Skipped item nr. 2 ]

3
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:57,585
Left, two, three, four!

4
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,726
Company,,,

5
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,325
halt!

6
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,628
Weapons straight ahead!

7
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:09,029
Take cover!

8
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,662
On your feet and march!

9
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,139
Take cover!

10
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,245
Left face!

11
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,945
Left, two, three, four.

12
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,489
Company, halt!

13
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,691
We're so exhausted.

14
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,527
A German must never fear fatigue.

15
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,999
Karl, I'm not complaining.

16
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,448
Damned chicken!

17
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:05,682
Fifty plus 1 0 equals 60, my friend.

18
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:08,412
Did you count my king?

19
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:13,286
This is a republic.
Kings don't count here.

20
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,805
This is how you dress
when visiting a foreign land?

21
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,375
Candles, socks...

22
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,311
Mr. Haussmann, your bill is ready.

23
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:42,182
It comes to 57 francs
and 7 5 centimes...

24
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:44,315
barring any error, of course.

25
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,818
I trust you, Mr. Rechampot.

26
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:50,728
You'll be paid
within three months, as usual.

27
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,798
I'm not worried.
You always pay on time.

28
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,297
Maryvonne?

29
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,238
Come down here.
Our friend is about to leave.

30
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,342
- What?
- He's leaving.

31
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:08,307
He's leaving.
Let's have one last drink.

32
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,550
Alas, I cannot.

33
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,849
You mustn't insult us.
A quick one will do you good.

34
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:17,152
The road is long.
I must be back by tomorrow evening.

35
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,326
Exactly.
It'll give you strength.

36
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,789
Another time, madam.

37
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,759
So, my friend.

38
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,774
At ease.

39
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:41,011
If we weren't here to keep them supplied,
the Germans would be in trouble.

40
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:46,444
Please convey my respects
to your priests.

41
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:49,555
I'm sure they're out in the bush
making new Christians.

42
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,056
They'll be back in two weeks,
if they're not eaten alive fiirst.

43
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,685
Attention!

44
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,688
Take up your packs!

45
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:02,770
Hurry up over there!
Faster!

46
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,100
On the double!

47
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,037
Company, right face!

48
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,879
Forward march!

49
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:17,175
Good Lord.

50
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,816
He works them hard!

51
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,483
Give my best to your offiicers!

52
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:27,559
Jawohl, madam. I'll do that.

53
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:40,002
That's all well and good...

54
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,902
but let's have a drink
before Mr. Rechampot sells it all.

55
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:56,119
Look at this,
all broken and beat up.

56
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:58,685
What can I give you for that?

57
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:03,363
Here, I'll give you a cross.
Now go on.

58
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,564
Let me see.

59
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:21,714
Here.

60
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:26,653
This Sacred Heart card is very nice.

61
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,157
Tell him a Sacred Heart
is more than fair.

62
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,229
That's not even worth a cross.

63
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:47,165
He says he wants the big colored statue
of the woman and child.

64
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:51,075
He says his necklace
is extremely valuable.

65
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,803
Then he can keep his necklace
and I'll keep my Sacred Heart.

66
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:57,516
I'll give you a cross
for the rest and off with you!

67
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,389
This is really getting on my nerves!

68
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:08,017
- You shouldn't expect much here.
- They know us too well.

69
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:09,084
Next.

70
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:32,474
Fidele.

71
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,544
HAPPY NEW YEAR 1 91 5

72
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,450
Yes, Sergeant?

73
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:45,863
Nothing.

74
00:08:57,545 --> 00:09:01,242
I thought you might want
to talk about...

75
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:05,710
the younger sister
of my brother-in-law's cousin.

76
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:07,811
The one I spoke to you about.

77
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,315
No, it was nothing.

78
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:15,525
Just talking.

79
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,087
But the young girl says...

80
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:20,827
she can do everything
just the way you like it.

81
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,436
Who taught her?

82
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:26,496
The old woman
who comes often to visit you.

83
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,910
Tell her to come knock
at my door one evening.

84
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,943
I'll do that.
You'll be pleased.

85
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,578
Leon?

86
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,255
Come on.Just for me.

87
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,628
I'm not in the mood.

88
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,359
The appetite grows with the eating.

89
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,369
Come on.

90
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,209
What's wrong?

91
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,770
Don't you ever get excited anymore?

92
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,656
To Mr. Lucien Herr,
College of Advanced Education...

93
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,119
45 rue d'Ulm,
Fifth Arrondissement, Paris...

94
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,892
in care of Administrator Tarato...

95
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:28,663
St. Pierre de Samba,
French Equatorial Africa.

96
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:34,932
Fort Coulais,January 6, 1 9 1 5.

97
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:38,412
Dear teacher and,
if I may, dear friend.'

98
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,116
Here is my punishment for not excelling
in nobler gfields of study.

99
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,583
I should be teaching Greek
in one of those pleasant schools...

100
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,384
of which our province is so proud...

101
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:52,217
but instead here I am
under a summer sky...

102
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,826
wandering through virgin savannahs...

103
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:58,194
picking native grasses
and collecting mineral specimens.

104
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,501
What good fortune
to be a simple geographer.!

105
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:11,473
Africa is far from being the hell
depicted in writings from the colonies.

106
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,513
Where I expected
to encounter gfierce beasts...

107
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,882
I fiind only dogs, cows, chickens...

108
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,054
and the occasional duck.

109
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,750
Where I expected ferocious savages...

110
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,222
armed with spears, lances
and poisoned arrows...

111
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:29,854
ready to turn all travelers
into a quick meal...

112
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,630
I meet only peaceful villagers...

113
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,692
whose pastoral lives remind me...

114
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,171
of the country folk
in many parts of our own land.

115
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,204
The only dangers I battle here
are boredom...

116
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,249
and the company
of a handful of our compatriots...

117
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,409
with whom I must rub elbows.

118
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,755
Listen,just because it's my turn
to be on watch tonight...

119
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,725
you don't have to take
such a long siesta.

120
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,258
Don't worry.
There's lots more for you.

121
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,071
The bastard!

122
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,903
Where are those empire builders...

123
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:20,204
those modern-day knights
and intrepid pioneers...

124
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,144
that all those adventure novels
had us dreaming of?.

125
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:33,050
Payback!

126
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,423
So I feel quite alone here.

127
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:39,022
Moreover, it's been six months...

128
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,069
since we've had any visitors
or correspondence.

129
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,197
It seems such delays are not unusual
in this part of Africa.

130
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,935
But I'm longing to know
what is happening in Paris these days.

131
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,678
What are they playing
at the theater and the opera?

132
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:56,610
What is Debussy composing?
What is Peguy up to?

133
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:59,752
And what's new
with our socialist friends?

134
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,721
As for the colonies,
tell our friends not to be so sure...

135
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,089
about the inferiority
of the black race.

136
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,760
Seen up close, this inferiority has less
to do with the shape of the skull...

137
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,662
or the composition of the blood...

138
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,392
than with the conviction we hold
of our own superiority.

139
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:19,272
At the risk of shocking you...

140
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,399
I daresay that in many respects...

141
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:26,170
the natives are not far from meriting
the honored name of''men. ''

142
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,707
Thank you, Barthelemy.

143
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,756
Dear teacher, I wish you
a happy and peaceful 1 9 1 5.

144
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:44,055
Respectfully yours...

145
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:45,598
Hubert Fresnoy.

146
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:53,604
There's no end to this junk.

147
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:00,140
Garbage!

148
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:04,179
This one's not too bad.

149
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,620
This we'll keep too.

150
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:17,624
Like the monsignor says, you can't even
give this stuff away to charity.

151
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:20,231
In the provinces, maybe.

152
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:23,560
Bad taste has limits
even in the provinces.

153
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,428
How I love this song!

154
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:39,809
Oh, my back!

155
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:49,488
- Thomas, how are you?
- Fine, Father.

156
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,421
- Are you here all alone?
- All alone.

157
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,719
- The other fathers aren't here?
- No.

158
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,460
But surely they'll be
returning tonight?

159
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,427
I don't know.

160
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:03,030
Have they been gone a long time?

161
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:06,233
- Long time.
- Long time very much?

162
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,769
Long time a little.

163
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,843
And they left no word for us?

164
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:16,113
They said monsignor said
they should join him.

165
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,145
What's all this about?

166
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,743
I don't know.

167
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,922
Didn't anything arrive for us
at Fort Coulais?

168
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:25,480
Nothing.

169
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:35,935
So there is something after all.

170
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,536
This isn't for us?

171
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:41,270
Not for you.

172
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:44,841
It's for the young man
who loves plants.

173
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:47,480
And where does that young man live?

174
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,808
Fort Coulais.

175
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,041
And where do we live?

176
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,650
You live at Fort Coulais.

177
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,547
But this isn't for us?

178
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,456
It's for you.

179
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,215
Great! Something to read!

180
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:40,930
Jaures has been assassinated!

181
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,491
Who?

182
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,599
- Who?
-Jaures.

183
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,877
Go on.

184
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,278
Mr. Hubert, you mustn't get upset.

185
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,780
God in Heaven!

186
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:05,449
My friends, we're at war.

187
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:06,584
Who is ''we''?

188
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,025
Us. France.

189
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:10,393
What's the date on that, Father?

190
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,557
- August 3rd.
- My God.

191
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,398
Does it say how it turned out?

192
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,807
They only go up to August 1 3th.

193
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,899
Who are we at war with, Father?

194
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,111
Germany, of course!

195
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:30,016
Really?
I would have said the English.

196
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,277
- Damn it!
- What?

197
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:38,586
That means I'm out
57 francs and 7 5 centimes!

198
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:40,952
Germany's never going to pay now!

199
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:42,460
What?

200
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:44,755
Germany.

201
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,432
- It's right out there!
- So?

202
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,763
The Krauts are out there!

203
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:51,904
That's right!

204
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:55,131
Luckily they can't know yet.
Everything comes through us.

205
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,543
- You hear that, Bosselet?
- It's time to wake up.

206
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,581
What are you so excited about?

207
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,617
- We're not excited!
- Yes, you are.

208
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:08,687
Remember: The military authorities
take charge in a case like this.

209
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:12,748
Exactly!
And around here, that's you!

210
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:15,052
In any case, it's clear:

211
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:18,423
The motherland is in danger.
Vive la France.!

212
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:23,493
Aren't you going to say
Vive la France?

213
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:43,121
You can't do that.
Imagine how you'd look.

214
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,990
- Like French patriots, that's how!
- French patriots!

215
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,052
How do you even know
this war isn't already over?

216
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,463
How can it be over?
It's hardly gotten started!

217
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:56,697
Mr. Rechampot, your little expedition
could turn out very badly.

218
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,202
Something like that
takes preparation, believe me.

219
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,806
And be careful about declaring war
on the Germans. They're no amateurs!

220
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,107
- There's only three of them!
- And they're all fools.

221
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:10,043
And I'd say their leader, Mr. Krafft,
in not much different than you.

222
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,184
All brains and no brawn!

223
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,411
Mr. Krafft doesn't seem to me
a man of action.

224
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,719
Please, Father, stay out of this.

225
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,658
Ever heard of Alsace and Lorraine?
Maybe I never told you...

226
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:21,921
but I'm from Alsace.

227
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,759
Couldn't you show a little spirit
at a moment like this?

228
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,703
To fiight three Germans
who've never done you any harm...

229
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,170
you so-called Christians--

230
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,707
- What do you mean, so-called?
- That's right.

231
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,105
You're willing to risk
massacring dozens of men!

232
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:38,542
What men?

233
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,206
There are only us and the blacks here,
and at most a few soldiers.

234
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,441
That's enough, Mr. Rechampot!

235
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:45,007
Watch your tone, young man!

236
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:47,277
I'm on my home turf here!

237
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:50,619
- Anyway, this is a discussion for men!
- I am a businessman, sir!

238
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:25,018
In light of the law ofJuly 7, 1 900,
on organizing a colonial army...

239
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:28,789
and the decree of February 7, 1 91 2,
and subsequent dates...

240
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:31,524
on recruiting an army...

241
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:36,528
and in light of certain indications
of the existence of a state of war...

242
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,001
between France and Germany...

243
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:43,031
and in light of the responsibility
vested in me...

244
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,246
I, Sergeant Auguste Bosselet...

245
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:50,141
hereby call upon every man
of French nationality...

246
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:52,344
with permanent
or temporary residence...

247
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:56,317
at Fort Coulais
in French Equatorial Africa...

248
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:59,748
to place himself at my command.

249
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,822
Article Number 1 :

250
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,830
A general draft is now in force.

251
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,256
This is better
than a New Year's Eve party!

252
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:17,368
Hey, Marius,
they're celebrating something.

253
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,406
Maybe that way
they'll leave us alone tomorrow.

254
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,668
Residents of Fort Coulais...

255
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,707
the Republic needs you.

256
00:23:56,777 --> 00:24:01,441
In the name of France,
I call upon all able-bodied natives...

257
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:04,206
of the masculine sex...

258
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:09,785
wishing to volunteer to support France
for the duration of hostilities.

259
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:13,121
The engagement of such volunteers
will go forward legally.

260
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:17,125
They will be provided
with clothes, shoes and equipment...

261
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:19,594
as supplies permit.

262
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,531
As a special bonus...

263
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:25,602
each man will receive,
while supplies last...

264
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:29,231
a useful household item
provided by the House of Rechampot.

265
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,608
Registration is now open.
Go on and join.

266
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:35,612
I'm glad that's over with.

267
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:39,311
These men don't understand French.
Someone should interpret.

268
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:42,446
What does it matter? If they don't
understand now, they soon will.

269
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,784
Anyway, I'm sure they agree.

270
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,690
Perhaps.
But it should be explained to them.

271
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,594
Marius, did you understand all that?

272
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,991
How would I not understand?

273
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:54,996
- Then you could explain to them.
- Of course I could.

274
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:56,930
What are you doing here?

275
00:24:57,003 --> 00:25:00,302
Get the hell back to the store!

276
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:02,503
Step forward!

277
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,814
Did you see that?
Nobody helps out anymore.

278
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,714
Press your fiinger here.

279
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,117
Open your mouth.

280
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,550
We need to fiind you a name.
Let's see.

281
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:20,787
Saturnin.

282
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,732
Your name will be Armand.

283
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,853
What is it, son?
Don't like that one?

284
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,719
Then give him a different one.

285
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,325
I wrote down two
and only give him one.

286
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,531
Jerome.

287
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,333
Open your mouth.

288
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,209
Alexis.

289
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,395
You are Volunteer Hippolyte.

290
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:34,089
Hippolyte.

291
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,000
I know your sister.

292
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,289
That's two, four, six, eight--

293
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,658
Two, three, four, fiive, six--

294
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:06,996
Out of my way.
Two, four, six, eight, 1 0, 1 2.

295
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,133
I counted 1 2 this morning.

296
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,269
That makes 1 2 rifles on the table...

297
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:16,538
plus fiive hunting rifles,
one of which is an automatic.

298
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:19,370
- I want that one back.
- Okay. Return to owner.

299
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,346
So six and six is 1 2, and six is--

300
00:27:21,414 --> 00:27:23,177
And six is 1 8.

301
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,584
Hey, knock it off!.
You're making me lose count.

302
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:29,986
Six and fiive makes 1 1 .

303
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:33,490
Six and fiive make 1 1 ,
plus six make 1 7, plus 1 2--

304
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:38,961
Seventeen and--

305
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:41,297
Twenty-nine.

306
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:47,536
- Seventeen and 1 2 make 29.
- Whatever you say.

307
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,507
Twenty-nine?

308
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:54,474
Hell, this should be over quickly.

309
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:59,143
We've got fiive dry cases and two
slightly damp cases of cartridges.

310
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,181
You see, Bosselet?
God is on our side.

311
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,186
Of course. God is French!

312
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:06,323
All right.

313
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:10,557
I'll need a week to teach
the volunteers the bare rudiments.

314
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,098
What? A week?

315
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,360
Are you crazy?

316
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:18,197
We're not running a pension! They don't
eat much, but it costs all the same.

317
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:21,069
All they need to know
is how to load a gun!

318
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:24,606
They may well be idiots,
but they can learn that in a day!

319
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:27,608
The regulations dictate
a certain minimum instruction.

320
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:30,577
Don't think you're going to make
these men into a real army!

321
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:33,752
You may not realize it, but we've been
at war for six months now!

322
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:38,287
If you're looking for the element
of surprise, Bosselet, don't draw this out.

323
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:41,883
You're right, Father.
I propose Sunday.

324
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:44,327
- Sunday?
- Why not?

325
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,494
You mean this Sunday?

326
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:48,898
Are you crazy?
We'd have to leave tomorrow night.

327
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,299
Exactly!

328
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,534
Sunday is when Protestants
put on their big show in church.

329
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,097
They're distracted.

330
00:28:56,342 --> 00:29:00,278
We show up and -- pow!
We'll give them a blessing, all right!

331
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,241
Without getting into that...

332
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:05,944
you can't go wrong
choosing the Lord's day.

333
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,250
Still, tomorrow night...

334
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,422
That's not much time.

335
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:45,549
Clear the way!

336
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:49,318
Thank you, Lamartine.

337
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:52,049
So, my son, you chose the infantry?

338
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,763
I'd like to speak to you
about something.

339
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:37,468
I intend to visit the Germans
without delay.

340
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,731
If Mr. Krafft is indeed
as much like me as you say...

341
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:44,868
I should have no trouble
persuading him...

342
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,538
that with ten against one,
resistance is pointless.

343
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,174
But my plan would be
more effective and persuasive...

344
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,408
if one of you would accompany me.

345
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:54,783
No, Mr. Fresnoy.

346
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:57,411
Why?

347
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,014
You don't know the Germans.

348
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:01,526
You can't comprehend
the German mentality.

349
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:04,290
At the moment
it's yours I can't comprehend.

350
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,459
Look at this chic fellow!

351
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:12,461
You haven't seen my brother yet.

352
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:22,137
Fathers, take a look
at the ambassadors of French style.

353
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:25,349
Ladies, are you going
to keep us waiting much longer?

354
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:26,885
We're almost ready.

355
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,722
Look at her tiny waist!

356
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:33,585
A delicate orchid.

357
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:36,861
She's so pretty!

358
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,398
It's now 9:1 2.

359
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:46,595
9:1 2 on January 22, 1 91 5.

360
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,375
We're preparing to go forth
from our native land.

361
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:54,879
The land where life is sweet
ends right here.

362
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:59,877
Over there is enemy territory...

363
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,485
which we will conquer by force.

364
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:07,318
That over there
could easily be the Rhine.

365
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:08,758
In fact, it is.

366
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,693
Let us cross the Rhine...

367
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:14,164
even if, due to unfortunate
circumstances...

368
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,766
it is but a modest stream.

369
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:21,868
I must set an example.

370
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:32,883
Bosselet, send the flag over.

371
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,248
The flag has made it.

372
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:25,533
This is so exciting!

373
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:51,189
There it is.

374
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,858
We're there.
I recognize this spot.

375
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:57,801
Through that shrubbery.
Those two white spots.

376
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,566
Next to the cliff.
That's their base.

377
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,609
No use going on much further.
It's too hot.

378
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,402
Bosselet, we'll leave you here.

379
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,607
We're stopping here, but you keep on.

380
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:11,013
See you later.

381
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,608
But we're with you in spirit!

382
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:16,412
Here.

383
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,351
There's shade...

384
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:21,287
and a nice view,
and we're not too close.

385
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,288
We'll stop here.

386
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:25,061
Stop.

387
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,195
Halt!

388
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,791
The House of Rechampot
is proud to bring you...

389
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:05,065
an aperitif of noble
and patriotic character...

390
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:09,096
that you won't fiind
at even the best seaside resorts.

391
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:11,541
Perhaps even Mr. Hubert...

392
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,943
our Marquis of Geography,
will do us the honor of--

393
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,839
Where is Hubert?

394
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,415
- Where is he?
- He was back there.

395
00:36:22,355 --> 00:36:23,344
There he is.

396
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,964
Don't go! Come back, Fresnoy!

397
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:40,530
Are you crazy?
Get over there!

398
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:47,676
Listen to me, son.
You'd had some schooling.

399
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,376
I'm sure you're a real brain,
but this is our home and our business!

400
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:55,645
These are serious and tragic events,
bigger than all of us.

401
00:36:55,888 --> 00:36:58,880
This is war, son,
and we're all in it together.

402
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,492
You've been drafted like everyone else.
He thought he was beyond the law.

403
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:04,553
Hard to understand
such a mentality.

404
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:08,367
Your fiield may be geography...

405
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,694
but what we're creating here
is history!

406
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,734
Marius, give me that bottle.

407
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:15,137
You'll drink like everyone else.

408
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:19,174
Weak stomach or no weak stomach,
you'll drink to France.

409
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:24,209
Assomption!

410
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,046
Mr. Rechampot asked me to fiind out
when your chickens will be ready.

411
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:42,364
- It's starting!
- To our brave soldiers!

412
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:01,079
That's the way, Bosselet.
He's really letting them have it.

413
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:06,489
Listen.

414
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,888
Pass me a little--

415
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:31,345
That's called a machine gun.

416
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:34,012
What? What did he say?

417
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,250
A machine gun, madam.

418
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,154
I think they're right.

419
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,551
The bastards!

420
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,256
Whatever it is...

421
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:49,199
if it keeps up like that...

422
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:51,964
I'd say it's time to close up shop.

423
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:55,232
QUick, get everything together.

424
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:58,767
Hurry!

425
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,110
What does that fellow want?

426
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:10,015
- What's he saying?
- The volunteer says, ''I fell in a hole.

427
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,320
I didn't see it.
It was hidden by branches.

428
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,190
At the bottom of the hole
was a sharp stick.''

429
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,159
The volunteer says, ''You must go
fiind my friend in the other hole.

430
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,498
The stick stuck him in the butt
and he can't pull it out.''

431
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,232
Virgin Mary, have mercy.
Others are coming!

432
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:38,883
It's nothing. It's nothing!

433
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:46,681
The volunteer says, ''I fell in a hole,
and in the hole was a--''

434
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,587
Yes, we know!

435
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:52,527
Damn it! This can't be!
Look at that!

436
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,429
Go away!

437
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,061
Go away!

438
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:01,096
You know any doctors in the area?

439
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:03,437
There are no doctors here!

440
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:08,370
Come on, come on!

441
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:33,064
Father.

442
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:38,803
We really only lost the bugler, after all.
So let the Krauts come anytime.

443
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,936
We've still got fiive soldiers.

444
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:43,846
I say they won't come.
And so what if they do?

445
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,951
The Germans aren't total savages.
We know them, after all.

446
00:40:48,187 --> 00:40:50,212
White men can always
reason with one another.

447
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,779
Unless we killed one of them.

448
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:54,587
What are you saying?
We didn't have time.

449
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:57,127
Don't worry.
We put up a pathetic fiight.

450
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:06,095
Go on! Have you no shame?

451
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,111
We recovered everything, sir.

452
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,844
Nothing is missing.

453
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:24,752
You witnessed my fiirst defeat.

454
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:29,651
You couldn't well have witnessed
my second, now, could you...

455
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,821
since this was my fiirst battle.

456
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,082
Make no mistake about it:

457
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:00,816
With their weapons,
they can slaughter us anytime they want.

458
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:04,721
We're in a bad mess.
Very bad.

459
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:10,734
I acted like an idiot.
No surprise there.

460
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,564
I am one.

461
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,207
Not tonight, darling.
This isn't the time.

462
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:29,414
Come back some other night.

463
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:31,350
It's me, Sergeant.

464
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:49,272
Forgive me, Mr. Fresnoy.

465
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:56,506
What's going on?
What's the matter?

466
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,447
I'd like to speak with you...

467
00:42:59,518 --> 00:43:03,045
because I know you and I
understand each other.

468
00:43:07,493 --> 00:43:10,155
That's very kind of you to say.

469
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,628
Because I'm--

470
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,239
Five years away from retirement.

471
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:27,245
I was just putting it all down
in my report.

472
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:32,580
Too bad we lost the bugler.

473
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:38,414
They gave us six soldiers
and we have to return six to them.

474
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:41,591
They're counted
the same as white men.

475
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:46,689
You may have to account
for him one day...

476
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:50,128
but I know you were pressured...

477
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:53,365
by certain people around here
taking the law into their own hands.

478
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,505
I wasn't keen on it.

479
00:44:01,246 --> 00:44:04,807
You think those people can get us
out of the fiix they've put us in?

480
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:10,084
If you only knew them.

481
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,657
They're...

482
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,486
What do you plan to do now?

483
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,891
Finish my report.

484
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:23,700
What I meant is,
do you know where you're heading?

485
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:26,805
For the time being,
I've taken certain precautions.

486
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:32,333
And what about later?
Do you have a plan?

487
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:34,176
Yes, I do.

488
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,612
No, I have no plan.

489
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:44,946
Sit down.

490
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:00,972
I have a few ideas to propose
to remedy the situation.

491
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:04,800
I know one doesn't learn
how to fiight a war from books...

492
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:08,369
and you know me primarily
as a geographer.

493
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:12,074
But I've also studied a bit of history.

494
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:15,751
I'm sure you have, Mr. Fresnoy.

495
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:17,285
Idea number one:

496
00:45:17,356 --> 00:45:21,053
War is too serious
to leave to shopkeepers.

497
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:28,499
I agree entirely.

498
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,031
Then follow me.

499
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:51,481
What is it?

500
00:45:57,863 --> 00:45:59,831
Another of his nightmares.

501
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,233
I was dreaming--

502
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,768
You sure were.

503
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:05,633
There's someone here.

504
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:08,767
No, Assomption, there's no one here.
Everything's fiine.

505
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:12,470
I said, ''There's someone here,''
but they don't answer.

506
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:14,076
It's us, Father.

507
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,252
Ah, it's you.

508
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,085
Forgive us for disturbing your sleep.

509
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,059
We weren't asleep.

510
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,463
Sergeant Bosselet feels
the moment has come...

511
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:40,096
to calculate the consequences
of yesterday's unfortunate expedition.

512
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:44,240
He's asked me to study
how best to correct the situation...

513
00:46:44,476 --> 00:46:46,171
and I accepted.

514
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:51,611
But I'm well aware
any effort will be of little use...

515
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,842
unless our entire community
is behind it.

516
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,411
That's why we've come
to consult with you.

517
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,081
Well done.

518
00:46:59,158 --> 00:47:01,786
We appreciate your initiative.

519
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:06,020
I consider a German attack
unlikely for the next few nights.

520
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:09,659
They'll need to check up
on their equipment fiirst.

521
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:13,030
So the danger--
the immediate danger--

522
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:16,264
will begin Thursday or Friday night.

523
00:47:16,508 --> 00:47:18,806
A very brief delay.

524
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:22,879
You're right.
That doesn't leave us much time.

525
00:47:22,948 --> 00:47:26,213
Also, given the improvised...

526
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:28,810
not to say idiotic, nature...

527
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,411
of our demonstration...

528
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,523
it's clear we should
expect no mercy.

529
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:37,720
Especially, Father,
given the ''German mentality.''

530
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:40,390
I'm afraid you're right.

531
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,023
Then we agree. Sergeant?

532
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,967
Please assemble our friends
in the clubhouse in ten minutes.

533
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:49,237
The clubhouse in ten minutes.

534
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:58,278
Do we need to be there too?

535
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:01,585
Yes, of course.

536
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:05,282
What is all this about?
I won't be led around by the nose!

537
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:08,053
This is a republic!
Damn it, we're free men!

538
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:09,593
Paul.

539
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:11,060
Stop being an idiot.

540
00:48:11,964 --> 00:48:12,988
Mr. Rechampot...

541
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:15,495
what do you propose?

542
00:48:15,734 --> 00:48:18,134
We're here to listen
to everyone's ideas.

543
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:20,166
Do you know what you want?

544
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,100
Of course I do.

545
00:48:33,252 --> 00:48:35,049
We want...

546
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,182
We don't want the Germans
to come here.

547
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,651
And if they do?

548
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:47,630
If they do... we surrender.

549
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,764
Maybe you, but not me.

550
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,928
I won't surrender.

551
00:48:53,005 --> 00:48:55,735
A Frenchman never surrenders
if he can do otherwise.

552
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,468
That's what I meant.

553
00:48:57,709 --> 00:49:01,509
If Mr. Fresnoy fiinds a way...

554
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,276
of course I would not surrender.
Just think of my inventory.

555
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:09,511
So, Mr. Fresnoy, here is my answer:

556
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:12,120
If they come, we don't surrender.

557
00:49:13,258 --> 00:49:14,816
But...

558
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,720
they mustn't come.

559
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:18,919
- They mustn't come.
- We won't surrender.

560
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,329
We won't surrender if they come,
but they mustn't come.

561
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:25,263
If that's what you expect of me,
I have a few ideas to propose.

562
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,827
One thing is certain:

563
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:30,238
Mr. Rechampot has just said
he has substantial inventory.

564
00:49:31,743 --> 00:49:35,474
Substantial... but not enormous!

565
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:38,207
Paul, don't start.

566
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,315
When destiny places you
in challenging circumstances...

567
00:49:41,553 --> 00:49:44,021
you must forget
you're a businessman.

568
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:45,818
Precisely, Mr. Templier.

569
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:48,325
I propose you set out
for St. Pierre de Samba tomorrow.

570
00:49:48,393 --> 00:49:49,724
Yes, Mr. Hubert.

571
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:52,525
Sergeant Bosselet will give you
a sealed envelope...

572
00:49:52,597 --> 00:49:55,225
which you will hand over
to the military authorities.

573
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,792
Your mission is to bring back
precise instructions...

574
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:02,768
and all the men and equipment
you can fiind.

575
00:50:05,477 --> 00:50:06,944
Why me?

576
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,871
I have a store to run.

577
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:15,246
Everyone has a store to run.
Do as he says.

578
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,718
But there are two of you.
Why doesn't your brother go?

579
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,320
Because my brother is...

580
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:24,085
an idiot!

581
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,191
You've been chosen...

582
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,957
because you're best suited
to such a sensitive mission.

583
00:50:30,202 --> 00:50:32,727
Let's not get bogged down
in shop talk.

584
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:35,534
Especially since the store
is not very busy right now.

585
00:50:35,774 --> 00:50:38,038
I could take care of it myself.

586
00:50:41,513 --> 00:50:43,174
It seems everyone agrees.

587
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,642
- Yes, we do.
- Certainly.

588
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:49,448
And how will you defend us
until reinforcements arrive?

589
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:52,248
The sergeant admitted
his volunteers keep disappearing.

590
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:56,556
We shouldn't expect miracles, you know.
We're dreadfully low on natives.

591
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,228
You said it, not me.
We shouldn't expect miracles...

592
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:04,029
and that's not what I expect of you.

593
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,540
Mr. Hubert.

594
00:51:20,352 --> 00:51:22,684
What's going to happen?

595
00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:26,723
Why, you're nervous too!

596
00:51:29,194 --> 00:51:31,355
What's to become of us?

597
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:36,566
I'm frightened.

598
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,221
Jacques.

599
00:53:18,436 --> 00:53:20,768
- Come with me.
- Where?

600
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,201
Come give me a hand.

601
00:53:34,286 --> 00:53:36,481
Put your hands like this.

602
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,181
For you, me and Maryvonne,
in case things go sour.

603
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,223
QUiet, you fool!

604
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:22,363
We should add some sugar...

605
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:26,401
green beans, corned beeF
and sardines.

606
00:54:26,905 --> 00:54:28,429
And maybe a few bottles of wine?

607
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:31,904
Right. And we'll tell 'em
it all went missing.

608
00:54:42,354 --> 00:54:44,686
Please, the floor pads.

609
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:47,320
Of course.

610
00:54:51,463 --> 00:54:53,294
Good day, Mr. Fresnoy.

611
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,598
Be seated.

612
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,869
Well?

613
00:55:06,144 --> 00:55:08,772
The men have fled.
The villages are empty.

614
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,643
- All of them?
- Every one.

615
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:15,184
Yet as of this morning
we know for certain...

616
00:55:15,253 --> 00:55:18,222
that Lieutenant Krafft is recruiting.

617
00:55:19,624 --> 00:55:21,319
And successfully, too.

618
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,322
Do you have something to propose?

619
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:30,323
Unfortunately, no.

620
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:33,696
The drums warn them
the minute we leave here.

621
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:36,634
There's nothing we can do
about their drums.

622
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,266
True.

623
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,671
There's nothing we can do.

624
00:55:54,926 --> 00:55:56,860
Convey my greetings to the chief.

625
00:56:01,499 --> 00:56:02,796
The chief says...

626
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:07,031
''It's a great honor to welcome the chieF
of the white men in my home.''

627
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,553
Tell the chief I've come
because his village is in great danger.

628
00:56:30,495 --> 00:56:32,190
The chief says, ''I know.''

629
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:36,359
Tell him the men of his village
have attacked white men.

630
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,933
Now the German white men
want their revenge...

631
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:41,336
and they're very ferocious.

632
00:56:49,214 --> 00:56:51,182
The chief says, ''I know.''

633
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:55,015
To defend his village,
the French will need 1 00 men.

634
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:04,027
He says, ''I don't have 1 00 men.

635
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:07,231
I lost many of my best men
in the great battle.''

636
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,801
The French know the tribes
on the savannah have many men.

637
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:16,636
If the chief can bring us
many of those men...

638
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,233
the men of his village
will no longer need to fiight.

639
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:31,186
The chief says,
''I can capture many of those savages.

640
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:34,619
There are many of them.
They are strong but stupid.''

641
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,922
He says...

642
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:40,394
''The people of my village have never liked
the people of the savannah.''

643
00:57:43,902 --> 00:57:47,804
He says,
''Why didn't you think of this sooner?''

644
00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:12,895
Come along.
Mr. Fresnoy is waiting.

645
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:31,238
So how many
have they captured for us now?

646
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:36,377
I say, how many
have they captured for us now?

647
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:40,048
Counting the ones
from this morning, 1 9.

648
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,490
Say what you like...

649
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:44,989
that man's really something.

650
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,894
He's something, all right.

651
00:58:48,366 --> 00:58:50,630
And you only see him from a distance.

652
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:55,730
To really know him,
you have to live with him.

653
00:58:57,709 --> 00:59:00,143
Well, I don't live with him...

654
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:03,306
and I daresay I was opposed...

655
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,742
but I do recognize...

656
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:09,316
that's he's a real brain.

657
00:59:10,622 --> 00:59:13,819
What is he really like in private?
Is he nice?

658
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,161
No, nice isn't the word.

659
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:25,701
I mean, he may be that,
but it's more like he's... he's...

660
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:28,061
He's what?

661
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,403
He's terribly refiined.

662
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:33,199
Terribly refiined.

663
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,378
And he hasn't changed.

664
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:38,374
We used to say
he was like a young schoolboy...

665
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,914
a bit taken with his own learning.

666
00:59:41,152 --> 00:59:43,518
But I'm here to tell you:

667
00:59:43,588 --> 00:59:47,285
Despite his education,
he's a real man.

668
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:50,760
I'll bet the poor baby's still a virgin.

669
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:52,728
I wouldn't put my hand
in the fiire on it.

670
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:56,062
That's not where you're supposed
to put your hand, you fool!

671
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,032
Madame Rechampot!

672
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,442
Madame times two!

673
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:10,572
The things she says!

674
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:14,384
Don't be embarrassed, Madame Caprice.

675
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:16,413
To Mr. Hubert!

676
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,454
On your inventory declaration...

677
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:27,096
you listed only 1 7 5 pounds of sugar.

678
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,231
Precisely.

679
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:35,200
And even that is gone.
Demand has been very high.

680
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:40,535
With everything going on,
I haven't had a delivery since...

681
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:43,711
June of last year.

682
01:00:43,948 --> 01:00:47,884
- Madame Caprice is in the same boat.
- Yes, the poor dear.

683
01:00:48,086 --> 01:00:51,544
Yet she has listed
300 pounds of sugar.

684
01:00:53,124 --> 01:00:54,113
Marius!

685
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,183
There are white men talking here!

686
01:00:56,327 --> 01:00:58,022
It's the broom making the noise.

687
01:01:00,164 --> 01:01:02,530
Of course,
they have a different clientele.

688
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:07,227
They're small retailers,
while we're wholesalers.

689
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,306
Wholesale, right.

690
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,399
Very well. We'll see.

691
01:01:28,326 --> 01:01:30,658
As strange as it sounds...

692
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:35,059
a wholesaler will sometimes
have less stock than a retailer.

693
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,829
But please go ahead
and look around.

694
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,404
Mr. Fresnoy.

695
01:01:54,652 --> 01:01:56,677
My brother made me do it!

696
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,450
What a liar!
Who hid those things there?

697
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:01,147
Did you hide those things there?

698
01:02:01,225 --> 01:02:04,854
''The yellow-speckled leaF
in the fecund autumn...

699
01:02:05,463 --> 01:02:08,921
surrenders gently all its golden grapes
to the fruit-gatherers.

700
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,403
Thus will fall
the passing flowers of life...

701
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:15,632
youth, love, pleasure and beauty.''

702
01:02:15,873 --> 01:02:17,465
Drink that.

703
01:02:25,216 --> 01:02:27,878
Drink it. It's the white man's drink.
Makes you strong.

704
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:30,486
It's good for you.

705
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:34,889
That makes 20.

706
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,991
An even 20.

707
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:40,090
It's getting harder every day.

708
01:02:40,331 --> 01:02:43,129
They haven't captured one
in three days.

709
01:02:43,701 --> 01:02:47,467
I asked for 1 00 men,
not 20 invalids.

710
01:02:48,372 --> 01:02:52,536
If the chief thinks he can
put one over on us, he's wrong.

711
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,502
Why not take it up with him?

712
01:02:56,848 --> 01:02:59,373
Tell the chief I didn't come
to listen to this idle chatter.

713
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:02,916
He promised me many natives.
He hasn't kept his promise.

714
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:07,615
Therefore I won't keep mine either,
and his men will have to fiight.

715
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:21,529
The chief says some of the captives
know where the natives are hiding.

716
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,434
Well? Haven't his men
been able to make them talk?

717
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:35,075
The chief says they tried...

718
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:38,311
but those captives won't talk.

719
01:03:38,723 --> 01:03:40,987
You'd have to torture them brutally.

720
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:46,825
Damn it!

721
01:03:47,465 --> 01:03:48,762
He's coming this way.

722
01:03:53,738 --> 01:03:55,569
Is it serious?

723
01:03:55,806 --> 01:03:58,639
Not serious. Important.

724
01:03:58,910 --> 01:03:59,934
Let's see it.

725
01:04:00,011 --> 01:04:02,138
It's not for you.
It's for your brother.

726
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,606
My brother?
I no longer have a brother!

727
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:07,480
It's for you, Cain!

728
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:11,652
Look at the yellow belly!

729
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,054
''Decision No. 23:

730
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:18,194
A military squad is hereby established
to obtain the necessary information...

731
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:21,060
for the recruitment
of a native militia...

732
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:24,268
to aid in the defense of Fort Coulais.

733
01:04:24,602 --> 01:04:28,265
The squad will be led by
Mr. Rechampot,Jacques Victor Louis.''

734
01:04:28,506 --> 01:04:31,168
Signed, Fresnoy.
And that fiixes you.

735
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:34,676
Say something, idiot!

736
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:39,179
I'm so happy!

737
01:04:40,952 --> 01:04:42,783
Look at that moron!

738
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,373
Bravo,Jacques!

739
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,466
See what you can do
when you set your mind to it?

740
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,701
Hurrah for the squad!

741
01:05:08,346 --> 01:05:11,281
These men are tall.

742
01:05:11,549 --> 01:05:14,177
The ones they caught before
were all so short.

743
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,854
Long live Mr. Fresnoy!

744
01:05:33,337 --> 01:05:36,204
- The priests wish to see you.
- Show them in.

745
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,542
The floor pads.

746
01:05:51,555 --> 01:05:52,544
Be seated.

747
01:05:55,726 --> 01:05:57,591
It's like this:

748
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,962
FatherJohn of the Cross
and myself were thinking...

749
01:06:02,033 --> 01:06:04,627
perhaps it might be helpful--

750
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:10,065
To help you get a fuller picture
of the delicate issues in this situation.

751
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:12,969
Issues which,
under the circumstances...

752
01:06:13,044 --> 01:06:15,342
one might be tempted
to deem secondary...

753
01:06:15,446 --> 01:06:20,076
but which, nonetheless, must
never be entirely neglected...

754
01:06:20,151 --> 01:06:21,948
by a Christian conscience.

755
01:06:22,486 --> 01:06:24,477
I'm listening.

756
01:06:24,555 --> 01:06:27,023
Certain murmurings and rumors...

757
01:06:27,158 --> 01:06:29,149
From native sources,
I hasten to add.

758
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:32,491
lead us to fear that
certain means have been used...

759
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,527
to attain certain ends.

760
01:06:34,598 --> 01:06:35,792
Highly commendable ends.

761
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:38,767
Means which are-- how can I say?

762
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:41,828
Not in keeping
with the respect due...

763
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:43,771
even to God's most humble creatures.

764
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:48,177
Mr. Rechampot is following my orders
in an attempt to ensure your safety.

765
01:06:50,915 --> 01:06:54,248
The thing is, we've heard rumors...

766
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:57,480
of brutality and injuries--

767
01:06:58,589 --> 01:07:02,150
Did you hear rumors when
the wounded were left to rot in the sun?

768
01:07:02,927 --> 01:07:05,259
Was there any talk
of the Christian consciences...

769
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:07,297
who fled those people
in their moment of agony...

770
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:09,356
without offering
even a drink of water?

771
01:07:10,534 --> 01:07:14,026
Or of the Christian consciences
who refused to lift a fiinger...

772
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:16,205
to prevent that massacre?

773
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,070
Remember: I didn't ask for this war.

774
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:24,778
The knife.

775
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,116
The cartridge.

776
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:35,791
The rifle.

777
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,363
Good day, Sergeant.

778
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,100
Good day, Mr. Fresnoy.

779
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,616
- The bayonet.
- The bay-net.

780
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:21,260
The coast is clear!

781
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,264
Assomption, get the bicycle!

782
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:26,400
Our Lord Jesus Christ.

783
01:08:30,114 --> 01:08:32,878
White men are stronger
than black men. Why?

784
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:37,282
Because they have a better god!

785
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:40,322
The white man's god gives strength!

786
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,289
This is a bicycle.

787
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:48,663
Any black man
who tries to ride it falls.

788
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:52,027
Who wants to try? You?

789
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,204
See what the white man's god
can do.

790
01:09:18,963 --> 01:09:20,760
The recruit says...

791
01:09:20,831 --> 01:09:22,799
''That's a white man's machine.

792
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,524
But the white man's God
doesn't give strength to the black man.''

793
01:09:25,603 --> 01:09:27,594
Then watch this.

794
01:09:28,172 --> 01:09:30,299
Assomption, it's your turn.

795
01:09:30,774 --> 01:09:33,208
This man is black...

796
01:09:33,444 --> 01:09:36,242
but he believes
in the white man's god.

797
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:10,206
Halt! Who goes there?

798
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:11,837
Creuse.

799
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:16,246
Don't be an idiot.
It's me-- Caprice.

800
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,720
- Creuse.
- What do you mean, Creuse?

801
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:22,017
It's the password.
You have to answer Chef-lieu Gueret.

802
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:25,788
Oh. Well, then, Chef-lieu Gueret.

803
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,998
Very well. You may pass.

804
01:10:38,809 --> 01:10:40,674
Good evening, Mr. Caprice.

805
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,543
Good night, Mr. Caprice.

806
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,450
Gueret la Creuse is the password?
Well!

807
01:10:58,028 --> 01:10:59,620
No one can go in.

808
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,292
No one can go in.

809
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:07,426
Isn't Fresnoy in?

810
01:11:08,072 --> 01:11:10,404
Mr. Fresnoy is in.

811
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:12,602
What's it for?

812
01:11:13,877 --> 01:11:16,744
That's my business.
Did I ask you anything?

813
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:20,247
Give me that doorknob.

814
01:11:22,086 --> 01:11:24,213
You can't have it.

815
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,754
Things not going well today, pal?

816
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,593
My name is not ''pal.''
I am Barthelemy.

817
01:11:33,964 --> 01:11:36,432
Do you know who I am?

818
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,797
You're Mr. Caprice.

819
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:41,964
- You know where I've come back from?
- Yes. St. Pierre de Samba.

820
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,168
Fill in this form.

821
01:11:49,613 --> 01:11:52,480
Watch it.
Don't play games with me.

822
01:11:52,549 --> 01:11:54,676
I'm warning you.

823
01:11:54,752 --> 01:11:57,243
Mr. Fresnoy's been expecting me
for three months.

824
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:59,414
I've worked my ass ofF
for three months...

825
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,515
rounding up grenades
and everything else for him!

826
01:12:03,594 --> 01:12:05,061
Very good.

827
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:08,959
How many cases?

828
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,995
Bastard!

829
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:30,511
Must not disturb.
You will see boss Sunday.

830
01:13:00,384 --> 01:13:02,477
You can't be serious.

831
01:13:02,786 --> 01:13:04,549
With a black woman?

832
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:06,854
Just like I said.

833
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,255
Him!

834
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:12,526
Bosselet I can understand.

835
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,526
But him?

836
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:16,732
Is she pretty?

837
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,663
Pretty?

838
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:21,230
She's black, like the others.

839
01:13:43,494 --> 01:13:45,428
Just shows you everyone
has their share of misery.

840
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:47,959
How awful.

841
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:21,661
Mr. Caprice, you were assigned
a diffiicult mission in every respect.

842
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,631
I'd like to state publicly...

843
01:14:25,803 --> 01:14:29,796
that you carried it out
in exemplary fashion.

844
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:36,001
Madam, you can be proud
of your husband.

845
01:14:36,647 --> 01:14:38,547
Thank you, Mr. Hubert.

846
01:14:38,882 --> 01:14:40,611
I'm sorry. Mr. Fresnoy.

847
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:01,765
Mr. Fresnoy, please take your place.

848
01:16:05,035 --> 01:16:06,866
Attention!

849
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:10,936
Right shoulder... arms!

850
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:16,978
Present arms!

851
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:21,510
Company at ease!

852
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,292
I wish you all a pleasant Sunday.

853
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,402
I hope you'll stay with us.

854
01:17:17,474 --> 01:17:18,907
Please.

855
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,945
Alas, we must get back.

856
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,406
Ladies, gentlemen.

857
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,715
He's leaving?

858
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,216
Well, that's that.

859
01:17:41,565 --> 01:17:43,294
Before we go back...

860
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,665
I want to show you
how they manage with the grenades.

861
01:17:45,736 --> 01:17:47,897
Good idea.
It'll give 'em some practice.

862
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:54,743
That didn't go down well with me.

863
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,670
I didn't fiind it heavy at all.

864
01:17:57,748 --> 01:17:59,739
I'm not talking about the mutton!

865
01:17:59,816 --> 01:18:01,909
I'm talking about him
and his black woman.

866
01:18:01,985 --> 01:18:03,850
Let us not judge, ladies.

867
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,213
True, there are some bizarre quirks
in that young man's nature...

868
01:18:08,525 --> 01:18:12,120
and his attitude seems
designed to provoke us.

869
01:18:12,195 --> 01:18:14,925
But we must at least give him credit...

870
01:18:15,165 --> 01:18:18,692
for guaranteeing
our peace and security.

871
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:22,668
And for giving us back so quickly
our accustomed lifestyle.

872
01:18:45,562 --> 01:18:48,030
Long live the Republic!
Charge!

873
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:15,281
He's brilliant.

874
01:19:15,358 --> 01:19:17,724
He took them by surprise.

875
01:19:18,328 --> 01:19:21,422
- I didn't see it coming.
- Me neither.

876
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:22,856
Of course not.

877
01:19:27,204 --> 01:19:28,603
First section.

878
01:19:28,672 --> 01:19:32,039
Come on, men!
Line up for your wine!

879
01:19:35,612 --> 01:19:37,341
You didn't drink it!

880
01:19:38,248 --> 01:19:41,740
Open your mouth
or you can't drink.

881
01:19:43,019 --> 01:19:44,577
Good, eh?

882
01:19:47,858 --> 01:19:50,452
It's the real stuff.

883
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,070
Go now, quickly.

884
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,404
Congratulations. It's as good a trench
as we saw in the newspapers.

885
01:21:10,473 --> 01:21:12,464
And without the mud, too.

886
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:15,769
That's for sure.
With Mr. Fresnoy in charge...

887
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:20,676
we won't wait for the rainy season
to give the Krauts a trouncing.

888
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:24,147
Soldiers of the French, surrender.!

889
01:21:24,955 --> 01:21:27,082
We have machine guns.!

890
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,718
We have warm clothes.!

891
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:33,256
you don't stand a chance.

892
01:21:33,463 --> 01:21:35,522
It's not true.
We're going to win.

893
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:37,624
God's on our side.
Take heart!

894
01:21:44,674 --> 01:21:46,699
The Lord is with you.

895
01:21:50,146 --> 01:21:52,137
- How are things?
- All right.

896
01:21:52,482 --> 01:21:55,246
- There's one man in bad shape.
- Inside?

897
01:21:55,318 --> 01:21:56,410
Let's go.

898
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:04,319
What a mess!

899
01:22:06,329 --> 01:22:09,321
He's in sad shape.

900
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,597
- Are we losing a lot of them?
- Two or three a week.

901
01:22:13,603 --> 01:22:15,935
This one here is the sixth this week.

902
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:18,134
Can't you do anything for him?

903
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,335
Wait for the rain to stop.

904
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:24,644
The French are using you.!

905
01:22:25,115 --> 01:22:26,707
you die to save their skin.!

906
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:28,842
Germany is kind to us.!

907
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:30,942
ComeJoin us.!

908
01:22:32,088 --> 01:22:35,387
France says go to hell!

909
01:23:11,394 --> 01:23:13,794
Tell him everything you just told me.

910
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:16,923
I have run a very long way.

911
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,460
The priests and ladies sent me
to say they're coming with soldiers...

912
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,665
who wish to speak to you.

913
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,504
What's he talking about?

914
01:23:26,576 --> 01:23:28,840
- Have they sent reinforcements?
- You're not lying, are you?

915
01:23:28,912 --> 01:23:32,143
- Are you pulling our leg?
- I saw the soldiers with my own eyes.

916
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:33,375
French soldiers?

917
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,773
Not French.

918
01:23:35,852 --> 01:23:36,841
Krauts?

919
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:40,048
No, not Krauts.

920
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,056
Then who are they?

921
01:23:43,993 --> 01:23:45,324
I don't know.

922
01:23:46,096 --> 01:23:49,463
How am I supposed to know?
But their chief is a black man.

923
01:23:57,173 --> 01:23:58,834
There they are.

924
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:02,306
Let go of my foot, for God's sake!

925
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,614
Give me your hand.

926
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:08,549
They're coming out into the open now.

927
01:24:08,618 --> 01:24:10,609
Now I see them!

928
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:15,649
Move over a bit.

929
01:24:15,725 --> 01:24:17,283
What if the branch breaks?

930
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,987
We have to let Bosselet know.

931
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,387
Absolutely not.

932
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:02,538
I shall translate...

933
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:05,005
what the captain says.

934
01:25:10,046 --> 01:25:14,574
The Germans surrendered at Yaounde...

935
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,211
quite a while ago.

936
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:21,621
The Allies decided to send
Captain Kapoor here...

937
01:25:21,691 --> 01:25:25,422
with a letter that reads as follow:

938
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,391
''To the Germans still fiighting:

939
01:25:27,464 --> 01:25:30,331
There's no point.
The war is over. Stop it.''

940
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,067
We beat 'em!

941
01:25:42,412 --> 01:25:44,880
The Germans are to surrender...

942
01:25:45,114 --> 01:25:48,743
only to Captain Kapoor.

943
01:25:48,818 --> 01:25:50,752
Perhaps you're wondering why.

944
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:55,086
Because the Allies
decided in London...

945
01:25:55,325 --> 01:25:59,489
that this territory should be ceded
to His Gracious Majesty.

946
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:03,157
We have come
to take possession of it.

947
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,924
Where do we come in?

948
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:08,737
I'm sure the captain
would like to freshen up.

949
01:26:23,586 --> 01:26:26,487
Nice uniforms!

950
01:26:36,799 --> 01:26:38,790
Hey, you, the smart one.
Come over here.

951
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:40,893
Come here for a minute.

952
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:46,303
Tell me, did this agreement
in London...

953
01:26:46,376 --> 01:26:49,209
say that our land will remain
part of France?

954
01:26:50,813 --> 01:26:53,509
It will still be France
up to the point...

955
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,016
where it used to be Germany?

956
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:56,718
Exactly.

957
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:02,448
So that means
only one thing will change:

958
01:27:02,659 --> 01:27:06,186
The blacks who were German before...

959
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:07,854
will now become English.

960
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,592
Exactly.

961
01:27:12,035 --> 01:27:14,230
Let me tell you something:

962
01:27:14,304 --> 01:27:15,862
It serves 'em right!

963
01:27:19,142 --> 01:27:20,006
Arms!

964
01:27:39,262 --> 01:27:40,991
Mr. Krafft.

965
01:27:41,364 --> 01:27:44,299
Come closer. Don't be shy.
How are you?

966
01:27:46,769 --> 01:27:48,703
What a nasty business, eh?

967
01:27:52,775 --> 01:27:54,572
My brother.

968
01:27:55,078 --> 01:27:58,047
Let me introduce Mr. Fresnoy.

969
01:27:58,114 --> 01:28:00,981
He's the young man
who gave you so much trouble.

970
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:04,110
If it weren't for him,
you might have--

971
01:28:06,055 --> 01:28:09,320
- You put on some weight.
- He looks good!

972
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,266
Yes, Sergeant?

973
01:28:31,948 --> 01:28:33,540
Nothing.

974
01:28:43,826 --> 01:28:45,316
White people.

975
01:28:46,095 --> 01:28:47,619
Really!

976
01:28:54,604 --> 01:28:58,199
Listen, don't worry about that bill.

977
01:28:58,574 --> 01:29:00,872
We'll work it out.

978
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:04,904
Philology?

979
01:29:05,648 --> 01:29:08,242
Yes, I was tempted at one point.

980
01:29:09,285 --> 01:29:13,483
But I must say, our philologists
can't hold a candle to yours.

981
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:18,023
- Which university did you study at?
- Heidelberg.

982
01:29:18,995 --> 01:29:20,622
Of course.

983
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:24,525
This will give you a laugh:

984
01:29:24,934 --> 01:29:26,765
I was a socialist.

985
01:29:30,273 --> 01:29:31,433
Oh, sorry.

986
01:29:31,841 --> 01:29:33,399
Me too.

987
