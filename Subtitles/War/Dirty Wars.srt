without even being charged with a crime.</i>

432
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:49,191

[Train rumbling]</i>

459
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,946
<i>I read everything I could about Al-awlaki.
It was obvious that he was an</i>

<i>immensely popular preacher with a large
following among young English-speaking muslims</i>

461
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:33,189

praised some of the attacks against</i>

I spoke with former c.I.A. And</i>

463

<i>military officials. They argued that
Al-awlaki's speeches were inspiring</i>

464
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:51,774

of words, from both Al-awlaki and the</i>

465

<i>U.S. government, but no concrete piece of
evidence that he was an operational figure</i>

466
00:51:56,614 --> 00:52:02,418
<i>in any attacks. I remembered seeing
him on TV nearly a decade earlier,</i>

467
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:09,425
<i>just after 9/11, and it was difficult to
reconcile the image of a new bin laden with</i>

468
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:15,030
<i>Al-awlaki's earlier sermons condemning terrorism.
>> The fact that the U.S. has</i>

469
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:23,032
<i>administered the death and homicide of civilians
in Iraq does not justify the killing of</i>

470

<i>one U.S. civilian in New York city or Washington D.C.
>> Scahill: For a short time,</i>

471
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:36,018
<i>Al-awlaki seemed like the go-to imam for
journalists trying to understand the experience of</i>

472
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:41,457

He was even profiled by</i> the

474
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:52,968
<i>All of the feelings of the American muslims
were similar to everybody else in America's--</i>

475
00:52:52,970 --> 00:53:00,970
<i>feelings of sympathy for the families of the
victims and a sense of that whoever did this</i>

476
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:09,785

decade after this video was filmed, Al-awlaki had</i>

name at the very top of the kill list.</i>

478
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:20,196

<i>to speak with Al-awlaki directly...
</i> [Camera clicking] But through a series of

485
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:05,074
intermediaries, I managed to set
up a meeting with his father.

486
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:10,212
I expected him to be reluctant to speak about
his son, but he seemed happy to reminisce about

487
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:16,518
an earlier time. >> Nasser Al-awlaki:
Anwar was an all-American boy.

488
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:24,520
This is in Disneyland, you know, in 1984, I think.
This is in San Diego when he was

489
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:29,598
already an <i>imam</i> with big beard, you know.
At that time he was asking

490
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,069
muslims to participate in the Democratic process in America.
In fact, during the presidential

491
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:40,142
campaign of George Bush, he thought the
conservative Republicans will be better than

492
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:46,282
the liberal democrats, and he encouraged
the muslims there to elect George Bush.

493
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,984
Scahill: Didn't he even, at one point,
attend a luncheon at the Pentagon?

494
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:54,290
Yes. You see, he liked America.
And he wanted to stay and

495
00:54:54,292 --> 00:55:02,292
really-- his life in America. But things came differently.
>> Can you explain to me why

496
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:08,470
your son went into hiding? >> After the
incident of Al-majalah, anwar was all over

497
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:14,977
the news. The drones started to fly
over shabwah, so, you know, anwar was

498
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:22,718
really concerned, and so we took his family
with us and he left to the mountains.

499
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:29,958
Child: [Shouts indistinctly] >> Hm, what?
[Laughs] [Speaks indistinctly to her]

500
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:37,960
[Coughs] Myself, with-- at this age
in my life, I really cannot ever

501
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:46,408
replace, you know, the role of my
son as he was doing for his family.

502
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,245
From my reading of the history of your
son, from his writing, it seemed as though

503
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:54,950
there was a transformation that happened
politically for him, from 9/11 to the invasion of

504
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:59,088
Iraq, something started to
change in his tone. >> Yes.

505
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:06,729
Anwar became popular before September 11 because
his sermons and his tapes, you know, were

506
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:13,068
very popular all over the English-speaking world.
And then the invasion came in

507
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:21,070
2003 and they invaded Iraq and destroyed Iraq,
so anwar really started to be more vocal in his

508
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:29,551
speeches against what the Americans were
doing against muslims all over the world.

509
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,755
There's no doubt that your son praised some
of the attacks against the U.S. >> yes.

510
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,524
And for many Americans, it was enough
to say anwar Al-awlaki is a terrorist.

511
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:41,663
But also I want decent American lawyer
to tell me that it is right for the united

512
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:46,935
states government to kill an American citizen
on the basis that he said something against

513
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:51,874
the United States or against American soldiers.
I mean, I don't understand.

514
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:57,446
I don't understand 100% the American constitution,
but I don't believe American law will

515
00:56:57,448 --> 00:57:02,351
allow the killing of an American citizen
because he says something against the united

516
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:05,454
states.

517
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:13,456
Scahill: <i>Anwar's father may have been
calling for justice under American law, but</i>

518
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:21,703
<i>American drones were already flying overhead.
The fact that they were trying</i>

519
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:26,275
<i>to kill an American citizen was shocking enough,
but there was another reason Al-awlaki's</i>

520
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:31,947
<i>story haunted me. >> We are against
evil, and America as a whole has turned</i>

521
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:37,986
<i>into a nation of evil. How can
your conscience allow you...</i>

522
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:42,257
<i>>> Scahill: Al-awlaki seemed to have
embraced the very identity he once opposed.</i>

<i>[♪...]</i>

528
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:24,594
<i>Al-awlaki was deeply affected by the war

529
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:31,540
<i>The day after September 11th, a woman stumbled
into his mosque in Virginia after being</i>

530

<i>beaten with a baseball bat. More than 1200
muslims were detained across the country.</i>

531
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:44,786
<i>>> Al-awlaki: You have muslims who are locked
up in jail and are left to rot in there.</i>

532
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:50,759
<i>There are no charges brought against them.
What have you done for them?</i>

533
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:55,731
<i>>> Scahill: Al-awlaki resigned from the mosque
soon after and left the country, but the wars</i>

<i>one Muslim nation fall after another and
we're watching, sitting back, doing nothing.</i>

put under surveillance, detained</i>

When he returned to Yemen,</i>

But this time, it was</i>

712
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:39,934
<i>a teenage boy. They had killed
anwar Al-awlaki's 16-year-old son,</i>

713
01:15:39,936 --> 01:15:47,936
<i>abdulrahman. I returned to
sana'a, but I wasn't sure why.</i>

714
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:57,178
<i>Was it to file another story? To investigate
another crime? Or was it to apologize?</i>

715
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:01,722
<i>[Birds chirp]</i>

716
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:09,724
<i>>> Nasser Al-awlaki: Abdulrahman left without telling us.
He said in a small note that</i>

717
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:32,219
<i>he's going to look for his father.
He left from the kitchen window</i>

718
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:39,093
<i>and he took a bus to the governorate of shabwah.
Then when his father was killed,</i>

719
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:43,898
<i>his grandmother told him, "there is
no use for you to stay anymore."</i>

720
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:51,900
<i>And he said, "yes, I will come
back in two days." [♪...]</i>

721
01:16:52,642 --> 01:17:00,642
<i>On the morning of October 15th, we got a telephone
call and they told us he was blown up to</i>

722
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:08,756
<i>pieces by the drone. And they saw
only the back of his hair, you know,</i>

723
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:14,395
<i>his relative, his cousin, he knew his hair
from the back and he recognized it and he knew</i>

724
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:19,100
<i>that abdulrahman really was dead.
But they could not recognize his</i>

725
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:27,102
<i>face or anything else. I always teased with
him about his, you know, his hair that he</i>

726
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:33,614
<i>should cut it because I thought
that he should do that. [♪...]</i>

727
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:41,616
<i>>> Scahill: The drone had not just
killed the boy, it vanished him.</i>

728
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:49,997
<i>I asked to see photos of abdulrahman
and suddenly realized why I was here.</i>

729
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:54,001
<i>It wasn't to investigate another death.
I wanted to see him when he was</i>

730
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,738
<i>still alive.</i>
<i>[♪...]</i>

731
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:05,740
<i>Abdulrahman's grandmother was in mourning,
but sat down with me for a moment to talk.</i>

732
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:45,786
<i>>> Grandmother: What did abdulrahman do?
Who ordered the killing</i>

733
01:18:45,788 --> 01:18:51,158
<i>of abdulrahman? He was sitting
having dinner with his friends.</i>

734
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:56,630
<i>How come he was killed? What did he do?
[Tearfully] you know,</i>

735
01:18:56,632 --> 01:19:03,704
<i>abdulrahman was... He was very, very
gentle boy and he never hurt anybody.</i>

<i>[♪...]</i>

737
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:14,709
<i>>> Scahill: I tried to make sense of abdulrahman's death.
His father's could at least be</i>

738
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:34,769
<i>explained, but a teenager with a Facebook
page and a group of adolescent friends?</i>

739
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:38,572
<i>Why would his name have been put on the list?
What could he possibly</i>

740
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:46,013
<i>have done?</i>
<i>[♪...]</i>

741
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:54,015
<i>The Americans said abdulrahman was collateral
damage, but they offered no explanation</i>

742
01:19:55,258 --> 01:20:03,258
<i>for the strike. And unlike
gardez, they made no apology.</i>

743
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,303
<i>It seemed an impossible coincidence.
They killed the father and</i>

744
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:13,607
<i>then the son.</i>
<i>[♪...]</i>

745
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:21,609
<i>But maybe it was as simple as that.
Like a tale from Greek</i>

746
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:30,124
<i>mythology. Abdulrahman was killed not
for what he'd done, but for who he</i>

747
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:37,665
<i>might one day become. A twisted
logic, a logic without end.</i>

749
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:50,238

first grandson, but what did</i> we <i>lose when the</i>

750
01:20:55,852 --> 01:21:03,852

his teenage friends? [♪...]</i>

751
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:16,631

idea where the story would lead me.</i>

752
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:37,652
<i>[♪..., no voices] I didn't know just how
much the world had changed or how much</i>

753
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:49,297
<i>the journey would change me. [♪...]
But I realize now the story has</i>

754
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:56,343
<i>no end.</i>
<i>[♪...]</i>

755
01:21:56,345 --> 01:22:04,345
<i>Somehow, in front of our eyes, undeclared
wars have been launched in countries across</i>

<i>the globe. Foreigners and citizens
alike assassinated by presidential</i>

757

<i>decree. The war on terror
transformed into a self-fulfilling</i>

like this ever end?</i>

759
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:30,177
