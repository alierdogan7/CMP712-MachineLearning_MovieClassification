I pray you tell it me.

438

from the Tower...

upon the giddy footing of the hatches...

00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,595
methought that Gloucester stumbled...

447
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,161
and, in falling...

448
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,973
struck me,

But still the envious flood
kept in my soul...

and would not let it forth
to find the empty, vast and wandering air...

465

but smothered it
within my panting bulk...

466

to belch it in the sea.

Oh, no, my dream
was lengthened after life.

Oh, then began the tempest to my soul.

470
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,778
I crossed, methought,
the melancholy flood...

471
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,083
with that grim ferryman
that poets write of...

472
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,319

473
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,952
The first that there
did greet my stranger soul...

474
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,588
was my great father-in-law,
renowned Warwick...

475
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,598
who cried aloud...

476
00:38:55,666 --> 00:39:00,433
''What scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?''

477
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,000
And so he vanished.

478
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,776
Then came wandering by
a shadow like an angel...

00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,010
with bright hair dabbled with blood.

480
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,917
And he shrieked out aloud...

481
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,149
''Clarence is come!

a legion of foul fiends environed me...

and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries...

486
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,440
that with the very noise
I trembling waked...

487
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,239
and for a season after...

<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

524
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,928
I beseech Your Graces
both to pardon me.

525
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,432
His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
that no man shall have private conference...

526
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,434
of what degree soever
with your brother.

527
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,936
Even so, an't please
your worship, Brackenbury...

528
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,938
you may partake of anything we say.

529
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,737
We speak no treason, man.
We say the king is wise and virtuous...

530
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:04,338
and his noble queen
well struck in years, fair and not jealous.

531
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,748
We say that Shore's wife
hath a pretty foot...

532
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,877
a cherry lip, a bonny eye...

533
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,117
a passing pIeasing tongue
and that the queen's kindred are made gentIefoIks.

534
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,124
How say you, sir?
Can you deny all this?

535
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:19,288
- With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
- [ Snickers ] Naught to do with Mistress Shore?

536
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:23,459
I tell thee, fellow, he that doth naught with her,
excepting one, were best to do it secretly, alone.

537
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,025
- What one, my lord?
- Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?

538
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,333
- [ All Laugh ]
- I beseech Your Graces both to pardon me...

539
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,965
and withal forbear all conference
with the duke of Clarence.

540
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:34,033
[ Sighs ]
I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad...

541
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,136
that wrens may prey
where eagles dare not perch.

542
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,410
Since everyJack became a gentleman,
there's many a gentle person made a Jack.

543
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,417
- [ All Chuckle ]
- But who comes here?

544
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,419
[ Catesby ]
The new-delivered Hastings.

545
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,819
Good time of day
unto my gracious lord.

546
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,823
As much unto
my good Lord Chamberlain.

547
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,984
- Well are you welcome to this open air.
- [ Chuckles ]

548
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,757
- How hath your Iordship brooked imprisonment?
- With patience, good Catesby, as prisoners must.

549
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,765
- My lord.
- Farewell, good Brackenbury.

550
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,735
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment.

551
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,101
No doubt, no doubt.
And so shall Clarence, too.

552
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,163
For they that were
your enemies are his...

553
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,209
and have prevailed
as much on him as you.

554
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,608
More pity that the eagle
should be mewed...

555
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,477
while kites and buzzards
prey at liberty.

556
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,779
- What news abroad?
- No news so bad abroad as this at home.

557
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:18,618
The king is sickly, weak and melancholy,
and his physicians fear him mightily.

558
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,850
Now, by Saint Paul,
that news is bad indeed.

559
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,654
Hmm. He hath kept an evil diet long...

560
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,321
and overmuch consumed
his royal person.

561
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:31,089
[ Clears Throat ]
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.

562
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,159
Where is he, Catesby,
in his bed?

563
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,535
- He is.
- God grant him health.

564
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,034
- Did you confer with him?
- We did, my lord...

565
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,069
and he desires to make atonement
betwixt the duke of Gloucester
and the brothers of the queen.

566
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,173
And betwixt them and you,
my good Lord Chamberlain...

567
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,184
and sent to warn you
to his royal presence.

568
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,186
[ Yells ]
They do me wrong...

569
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,449
and I will not endure it.

570
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,491
Who are they
that complain unto the king...

571
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,026
that I, forsooth, am stern
and love them not?

572
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:01,360
By holy Paul, they love His Grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.

573
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,525
Because I cannot flatter
and speak fair...

574
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,865
smile in men's faces,
smooth, deceive and cog...

575
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,030
duck with French nods
and apish courtesy...

576
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,040
I must be held a rancorous enemy.

577
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,736
Cannot a plain man
live and think no harm...

578
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,336
but thus his simple truth
must be abused...

579
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,745
by silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

580
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,718
- To whom in all this presence speaks Your Grace?
- To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.

581
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,414
When have I injured thee?
When done thee wrong? Or thee? Or thee?

582
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,923
Or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all.

583
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,721
His Royal Grace, whom God preserve
better than you would wish...

584
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,728
cannot be quiet
scarce a breathing-while...

585
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,026
but you must trouble him
with lewd complaints.

586
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,397
Come, come, we know your meaning,
Brother Gloucester.

587
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,902
You envy my advancement
and my friends'.

588
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,904
God grant we never may have
need of you!

589
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,463
Meantime, God grants
that we have need of you.

590
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,600
Our brother is imprisoned
by your means...

591
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,407
myself disgraced and the nobility
held in contempt...

592
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,142
while great promotions
are daily given to ennoble those...

593
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,810
that scarce some two days since
were worth a noble.

594
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,115
By God who raised me
to this careful height...

595
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,212
from that contented hap
which I enjoyed...

596
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:02,156
I never did incense his majesty
against the duke of Clarence...

597
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,922
but have been an earnest advocate
to plead for him.

598
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,658
My lord, you do me shameful injury
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

599
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,133
You may deny that you were not the cause
of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

600
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,170
- She may, my lord -
- She may, Lord Rivers.

601
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,469
Why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that.

602
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,068
She may help you to many fair preferments
and then deny her aiding hand therein...

603
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,170
and lay those honors
on your high desert.

604
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,080
Ha! What may she not?
She may, aye, marry, may she -

605
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,983
- What, marry, may she?
- ''What, marry, may she?'' Marry with a king...

606
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,986
a bachelor
and a handsome stripling, too.

607
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,887
I guess your grandam
had a worser match.

608
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,323
My lord of Gloucester,
I have too long borne...

609
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,861
your blunt upbraidings
and your bitter scoffs.

610
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,897
By heaven,
I will acquaint His Majesty...

611
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,955
with those gross taunts
I often have endured.

612
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,992
<i>What? Threat you me with telling of the king?</i>
<i>Tell him and spare not.</i>

613
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,732
Look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king.

614
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,504
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak, my pains are quite forgot.

615
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:57,172
I had rather be a country servant-maid
than a great queen, with this condition...

616
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,148
to be thus baited,
scorned and stormed at.

617
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,515
Small joy have I
in being England's queen.

618
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,952
Ere you were queen, aye,
or your husband king...

619
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,956
I was a packhorse
in his great affairs...

620
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,391
a weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
a liberal rewarder of his friends.

621
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,758
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

622
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,230
In all which time you
and your late husband...

623
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,233
together with his son Dorset here...

624
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,065
were factious for the house of Lancaster-
and, Rivers, so were you.

625
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,937
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
what you have been ere this, and what you are.

626
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,941
Withal, what I have been,
and what I am.

627
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,239
Poor Clarence did forsake
his father-in-law, Warwick-

628
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,473
Aye, and forswore himself-
which Jesu pardon -

629
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,481
to fight on Edward's party
for the crown.

630
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,040
And for his meed,
poor lord, he is mewed up.

631
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,279
I would to God
my heart were flint, like Edward's...

632
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,288
or Edward's soft and pitiful,
like mine.

633
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,290
I am too childish-foolish
for this world.

634
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,826
My lord of Gloucester,
in those busy days...

635
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,919
which here you urge
to prove us enemies...

636
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,590
we followed then our lord,
our lawful king.

637
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,828
So should we you,
if you should be our king.

638
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,927
If I should be?
I'd rather be a peddler.

639
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,097
Far be it from my heart,
the thought thereof.

640
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,107
As little joy, my lord,
as you suppose...

641
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,269
you should enjoy,
were you this country's king...

642
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,314
as little I enjoy,
being the queen thereof.

643
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,315
Dispute not with him.
He is lunatic.

644
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,613
Peace, Master Marquess,
you are malapert.

645
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,915
Your fire-new stamp of honor
is scarce current.

646
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:15,584
- What doth he say, my lord of Stanley?
- Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

647
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,651
They that stand high
have many blasts to shake them.

648
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,755
And when they fall,
they dash themselves to pieces.

649
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,767
Good counsel.
Marry, learn it, Marquess. Learn it.

650
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:28,396
- It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
- Aye...

651
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,838
and much more.

652
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,877
But I was born so high.

653
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,912
[ Richard ]
I was too hot to do somebody good...

654
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,311
that is too cold in thinking of it now.

655
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,316
Marry, as for Clarence,
he is well repaid.

656
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,443
He is franked up
to fatting for his pains.

657
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,453
God pardon them
that are the cause thereof.

658
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,751
A virtuous
and a Christian-like conclusion...

659
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,757
to pray for them
that have done wrong to us.

660
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,986
So do I ever,
being well-advised.

661
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,325
For had I cursed now,
I had cursed myself.

662
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:57,333
Madam, His Majesty doth call for you
and for Your Grace and you, my noble lords.

663
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,199
Catesby, we come.
Lords, will you go with us?

664
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,397
Madam, we will attend Your Grace.

665
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,772
Go you before, and I will follow you.

666
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,646
But soft...

667
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,045
But soft...

668
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,241
here come my executioners.

669
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,354
How now, my hardy, stout
resolved mates!

670
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,416
Are you now going
to dispatch this thing?

671
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,951
We are, milord, and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is.

672
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,555
Well thought upon.
I have it here about me.

673
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,624
Uh -

674
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,401
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution...

675
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,809
withal obdurate,
do not hear him plead...

676
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,872
for Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

677
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,714
Tush! Fear not, milord,
we will not stand to prate.

678
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,754
Talkers are no good doers.

679
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,347
Be assured we come to use our hands
and not our tongues.

680
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:58,383
[ Chuckles ] Your eyes drop millstones

I like you, lads. About your business straight.

683
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,295
- Go, go, dispatch.
- We will, my noble lord.

684
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
In God's name, who are you,
and how came you hither?

685
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,810
I would speak with Clarence,
and I came hither on my legs.

686
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,613
- Be you so brief?
- O, sir, 'tis better to be brief than tedious.

687
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,120
Show him our commission
and talk no more.

688
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:35,094
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
the noble duke of Clarence to your hands.

689
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:40,929
I will not reason what is meant thereby,
because I will be guiltless of the meaning.

690

Here is the key.

691
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,936
There lies the duke asleep.

692

I'll to His Majesty and certify His Grace
that thus I have resigned my charge to you.

You may, sir.
It is a point of wisdom. Fare you well.

in the malmsey butt in the next room.

from my Redeemer...

to redeem me hence...

713
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,044
and now...

714
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,410

shall part for heaven...

720
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,295
By heaven, my heart is purged
from grudging hate...

721
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,130
and with my hand I seal
my true heart's love.

722
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,103
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like.

723

Take heed you dally not
before your king...

lest he that is
the supreme King of Kings...

confound your hidden falsehood...

726

to be the other's end.

So prosper I,
as I swear perfect love.

And I, as I love Hastings
with my heart.

of this peace.

759

a happy time of day.

deeds of charity...

762

between these swelling
wrong-incensed peers.

764
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,569
A blessed labor,

by any in this presence...

to his friendly peace.

'Tis death to me to be at enmity.

were lodged between us -

of you, <i>Lord</i> Rivers,
and, <i>Lord</i> Grey, of you -

778

of you, my noble Marquess,
<i>lord</i> of Dorset -

779
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,322
that all without desert
have frowned on me -

781
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,763

I do not know that Englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds...

783
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,901
more than the infant
that is born tonight.

784
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,467

- Who knows he is?
- All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

Look I so pale, Lord Dorset,

00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,648
Aye, my good lord...

797
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,719

but his red color hath forsook his cheeks.

798

The order was reversed.

799

But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
and that a winged Mercury did bear.

Some tardy cripple
bore the countermand...

Who sued to me for him?

803
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:47,181
Who, in my rage, kneeled at my feet,
and bade me be advised?

804

Who spake of brotherhood?

805
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,626
Who spake of love?

806
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:56,563
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty Warwick and did fight for me?

807
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,966
Who told me,
in the field by Tewksbury...

808
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,470
when Warwick had me down,
he rescued me...

809
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,669
and said,
''Dear Brother, live and be a king''?

810
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,611
Who told me...

811
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,170
when we both lay on the ground
frozen almost to death...

812
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:15,479
how he did lap me
even in his own garments...

813
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:19,488
and gave himself, all thin and naked,
to the numb, cold night?

814

All this from my remembrance
brutish wrath sinfully plucked...

00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:30,125
and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind!

Oh, God!

818
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,604

on me, and you...

819

and mine, and yours for this.

00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,082
Come, Hastings, help me to my bed.

Marked you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen...

of Clarence' death?

01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,798
Oh, my good Lord Stanley,

should break out...

01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,680
<i>Where it thinks best</i>
<i>unto your royal self.</i>

1019
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,691
If I may counsel you...

1020
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,718
some day or two
Your Highness shall repose you...

1021
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,788
at the Tower.

1022
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,536
Then where you please...

1023
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,267
and shall be thought most fit
for your best health and recreation.

1024
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,866
I do not like the Tower...

1025
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,703
of any place.

1026
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,978
So wise so young, they say,
do ne'er live long.

1027
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,144
Did Julius Caesar
build that place, milord?

1028
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,586
He did, my gracious lord,
begin that place.

1029
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:23,124
ThatJulius Caesar was a famous man.

1030
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,183
With what his valor
did enrich his wit...

1031
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,785
his wit set down
to make his valor live.

1032
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,727
Nay, for a need,
thus far come near my person.

1033
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,328
Tell them that when my mother
was with child -

1034
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,374
with my yet unborn brother-

1035
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:41,432
noble York, my princely father...

1036
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,444
then had wars in France...

1037
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,503
and by true computation of the time...

1038
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,572
found that the issue
was not his begot...

1039
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:51,380
which well appeared in his lineaments,
being nothing like the duke, my noble father.

1040
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,251
Yet, uh, touch this sparingly,
as 'twere far off...

1041
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,814
because, my lord,
you know, my mother lives.

1042
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,019
<i>I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>my cousin Buckingham.</i>

1043
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:02,723
- <i>What, my gracious lord?</i>
- An if I live until I be a man...

1044
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:05,767
I'll win our ancient rights
in France again...

1045
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,462
or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

1046
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:12,768
Short summers lightly have
a forward spring.

1047
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,900
Fear not, my lord,
I'll play the orator...

1048
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:17,605
as if the golden fee for which I plead
were for myself.

1049
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,273
If you thrive well,
bring them to Baynard's Castle...

1050
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,408
where you shall find me
well accompanied...

1051
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,577
with reverend fathers
and well-learned bishops.

1052
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,315
Ah, in good time,
here comes the duke of York.

1053
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,533
<i>Richard of York.</i>

1054
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,674
How fares our loving brother?

1055
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:58,049
Well, my dread lord -
so must I call you now.

1056
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,920
Aye, Brother,
to our grief, as it is yours.

1057
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:13,331
How fares our noble cousin,
princely York?

1058
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,495
- [ Giggles ]
- [ Laughing ]

1059
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,630
I thank you, gentle Uncle.

1060
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,073
Oh, my lord, you said that
idle weeds are fast in growth.

1061
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,237
The prince my brother
hath outgrown me far.

1062
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,508
- He hath, milord.
- And therefore is he idle?

1063
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:30,279
- Oh, my dear lord, I must not say so.
- Then he is more beholding to you than I.

1064
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,411
Ah, he may command me
as my sovereign...

1065
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,512
but you have power in me
as a kinsman.

1066
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,558
I pray you, Uncle,
give me this dagger.

1067
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,559
My dagger, little cousin?
With all my heart.

1068
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:41,960
- A beggar, Brother?
- Of my kind uncle, that I know will give...

1069
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,225
and being but a toy,
which is no grief to give.

1070
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,324
A greater gift than that
I'll give my cousin.

1071
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,995
A greater gift?
Oh, that's the sword to it.

1072
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:52,529
- Too weighty for Your Grace to wear.
- I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

1073
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,133
What, would you have
my weapon, little lord?

1074
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,610
I would, that I might thank you
as you call me.

1075
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,613
- How?
- Little.

1076
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,706
My lord of York
will still be cross in talk.

1077
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,149
Uncle, Your Grace knows
how to bear with him.

1078
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,346
You mean to bear me,
not to bear with me.

1079
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,754
- [ All Chuckle ]
- Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.

1080
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,918
Because that I am little,
like an ape...

1081
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,588
he thinks that you should
bear me on your shoulder!

1082
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,912
With what a sharp-provided wit
he reasons!

1083
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:43,151
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
he prettily and aptly taunts himself.

1084
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,785
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

1085
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,852
My lord, will't please you pass along?

1086
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,329
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
will to your mother...

1087
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,095
to entreat of her to meet you
at the Tower and welcome you.

1088
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,295
What, will you
go unto the Tower, my lord?

1089
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,838
My Lord Protector
needs will have it so.

1090
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,136
I shall not sleep in quiet
at the Tower.

1091
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:04,042
- Why, what should you fear?
- Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.

1092
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,672
My grandam told me
he was murdered there.

1093
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:10,081
- I fear no uncles dead.
- Nor none that live, I hope.

1094
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,144
And if they live,
I hope I need not fear.

1095
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,390
But come,
and with heavy hearts...

1096
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,452
thinking on them...

1097
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,691
go we unto the Tower.

1098
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,718
Well, let them rest.

1099
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,788
Now, my lord,
what shall we do...

1100
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:02,735
if we perceive that the Lord Hastings
will not yield to our complots?

1101
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,140
Chop off his head, man.

1102
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,440
Somewhat we will do.

1103
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:23,948
Come hither, Catesby.

1104
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,191
Thou art sworn as deeply
to effect what we intend...

1105
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,697
as closely to conceal what we impart.

1106
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,200
Thou knowest our reasons
urged upon the way.

1107
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,600
What thinkest thou?
Is it not an easy matter...

1108
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,002
to make Lord Hastings of our mind...

1109
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:42,407
for the installment of this noble duke
in the seat royal of this famous isle?

1110
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:45,640
He for the late king's sake
so loves the prince...

1111
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,205
that he will not be won
to aught against him.

1112
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,081
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley?
What will he?

1113
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:54,418
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

1114
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,414
Hmm.

1115
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,157
Well, then, no more but this.

1116
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,198
Go, gentle Catesby...

1117
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,827
and, as it were far off,
sound thou Lord Hastings...

1118
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,394
how he stands
affected unto our purpose...

1119
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,440
and summon him
tomorrow to the Tower...

1120
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:14,475
to counsel on the coronation.

1121
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:18,639
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
encourage him and show him all our reasons.

1122
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,409
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling...

1123
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,951
be thou so too,
and so break off your talk...

1124
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,987
and give us notice of his inclination.

1125
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,251
I will, my lord.
Farewell, Your Graces both.

1126
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,559
Catesby...

1127
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,822
commend me to Lord Hastings.

1128
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,922
Tell him his ancient knot
of dangerous adversaries...

1129
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,467
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey...

1130
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,299
tomorrow are let blood
at Pomfret castle.

1131
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:46,272
And bid my friend,
for joy of this good news...

1132
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,640
give Mistress Shore
one gentle kiss the more.

1133
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,645
My lord.

1134
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,636
<i>[ Whispers ]</i>
<i>My lord.</i>

1135
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,046
My lord.

1136
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:38,615
- Who knocks?
- <i>One from the Lord Stanley.</i>

1137
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,931
- What is't o'clock?
- Upon the stroke of 4:00.

1138
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,706
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep
these tedious nights?

1139
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,213
So it appears by that I have to say.

1140
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,512
First, he commends him
to your noble self.

1141
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,144
- <i>[ Soft Rattle ]</i>
- What then?

1142
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,553
Then certifies your lordship
that this night he had a dream -

1143
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,989
the boar razed off his helm.

1144
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,391
Therefore he sends to know
your lordship's pleasure...

1145
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,429
if you will presently
take horse with him...

1146
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,931
and with all speed post with him
toward the north...

1147
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,900
to shun the danger
that his soul divines.

1148
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,028
Go, fellow, go,
return unto thy lord.

1149
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,971
Tell him his fears are shallow,
without instance.

1150
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,236
And for his dreams,
I wonder he's so simple...

1151
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:31,279
to trust the mockery
of unquiet slumbers.

1152
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,439
To fly the boar
before the boar pursues...

1153
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,540
were to incense
the boar to follow us...

1154
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,744
and make pursuit
where he did mean no chase.

1155
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,844
Go, bid thy master rise
and come to me...

1156
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,855
and we will both together
to the Tower...

1157
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,323
where he shall see
the boar will use us kindly.

1158
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,826
I'll go, my lord,
and tell him what you say.

1159
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,395
How now, sirrah.

1160
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:01,772
- How goes the world with thee?
- The better that your lordship please to ask.

1161
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,262
Many good morrows to my noble lord.

1162
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,596
Good morrow, Catesby.

1163
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,797
[ Chuckles ]

1164
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:33,137
You are early stirring.

1165
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:38,473
What news?
What news, in this our tottering state?

1166
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,605
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord.

1167
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:44,151
And, uh...

1168
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,915
I believe will never stand upright...

1169
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,388
till Richard
wear the garland of the realm.

1170
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,788
- How? Wear the garland?
- Mm-hmm.

1171
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,354
- Dost thou mean the crown?
- Aye, my good lord.

1172
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,832
I'll have this crown of mine
cut from my shoulders...

1173
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,995
before I'll see the crown
so foul misplaced.
