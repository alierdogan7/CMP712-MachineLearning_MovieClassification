1
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,272
(theme music playing)

2
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,480
(distant explosions)

3
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,952
(man shouting orders)

4
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
(gunfire)

5
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,247
Man:
Hanging, fire!

6
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,630
Sledge, drop...

7
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,238
- (bullet zings)
- Ahh!

8
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,538
(indistinct shouting)

9
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,510
Thanks.

10
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,433
- Burgin.
- Hillbilly.

11
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,608
You used to
not smoke.

12
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,318
Guess I do now.

13
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,821
I need volunteers!
NCOs report to me

14
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,698
at 1050.

15
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,117
Corpsman,
do blister checks.

16
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,620
Draw ammo
and be resupplied

17
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,331
and ready to move
at 1100.

18
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,875
Room service awaits

19
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,294
and there's time to
savor every bite.

20
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,879
Go and get your chow.

21
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,633
1100? Ack Ack just
gave us the fucking morning off.

22
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,260
Man:
Let's go get some breakfast!

23
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,728
I can't even recognize
this place.

24
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,482
Judging from those planes,
I think it's the airfield we took a while back.

25
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,317
Oh, yeah,
now I remember.

26
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,403
We were over there and
the Japs were over there.

27
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,780
- The Japs were where we're sittin'.
- Right.

28
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,491
It's all coming
back to me now.

29
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,455
Why didn't I enlist
in the Seabees?

30
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,166
I could have come to Peleliu
in the seat of a bulldozer.

31
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,257
Any of you guys got
a Jap sword or flag?

32
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,801
I'll pay
good money for it.

33
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,304
Or a Jap bayonet?

34
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,015
Any kind of Jap weapon...
I'll take it.

35
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,726
Sure.
I keep them in my ass.

36
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,520
Reach up,
grab what you want.

37
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,230
Seriously.

38
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,566
I gotta get me
a Jap sword.

39
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,276
I can't go home from
the war empty-handed.

40
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,694
I can arrange for
a Purple Heart.

41
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,530
Ain't nobody going home.

42
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,911
Any of you guys
got a Jap sword?

43
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,122
Fuck off!

44
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,458
- Boys.
- Hello, sir.

45
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,834
- Hey, Skipper.
- Hey, Skip.

46
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,544
Skip.

47
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,717
Never run when
you can walk.

48
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,760
Never walk when
you can stand.

49
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,305
Never stand when
you can sit.

50
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,432
Never sit when
you can lay down.

51
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,393
Both: Never lay down
when you can sleep.

52
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,481
And never pass a supply
of clean water.

53
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,150
Amen.

54
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,073
(grunts)

55
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,247
You get enough to eat?

56
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,999
I did, sir.

57
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,591
You're a Southern man,
right?

58
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,763
Yes, sir.
Mobile, Alabama.

59
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,434
You realize our ancestors
probably shot at each other

60
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,520
at Gettysburg or Bull Run?

61
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,898
My great-grandfather
served with General Bragg.

62
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,984
Yeah?
What's your old man do?

63
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,279
He's a doctor,
internal medicine.

64
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,448
Treated vets from
the First World War.

65
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,909
Might have patched up
Gunny Haney.

66
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,205
My dad's a shop foreman
at a textile mill in Massachusetts.

67
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,250
He weaved wool fabric
for the military...

68
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,502
all our Marine greens,

69
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,837
our blankets.

70
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,802
It's nice to think my father
might have had something to do

71
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,429
with the blankets we
sleep in.

72
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,682
(flies buzzing)

73
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,141
(explosion)

74
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,851
- Man: Fuck!
- Man #2: Damn.

75
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,523
I got a detail for you.

76
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,816
Yes, sir.

77
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,277
No no, as you were.
As you were.

78
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,279
You got a watch?

79
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,781
Yes, sir.

80
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,158
You show 0950?

81
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,577
I do, sir.

82
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,913
Good. Wake me up
in 20 minutes.

83
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,671
Will do, sir.

84
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,154
- Look at that.
- Haney: Let's go!

85
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,781
Let's go!
You heard the skipper!

86
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,617
Let's go!

87
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,373
That's the way
to kill Japs...

88
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,376
buzz in, fry 'em,
buzz back.

89
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,552
Man:
Hey, look, it's Colonel Puller.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,471
It's the 1st Marines.

91
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,311
- Man: Sir.
- Puller: You're up, boys.

92
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,979
Colonel.

93
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,065
Hello, sir.

94
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,442
Puller:
Go get 'em!

95
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,572
Good job.

96
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,159
Man:
Way to go, 1st.

97
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,078
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

98
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,080
Semper fi.

99
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,258
Hey.

100
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,931
How you doin'?

101
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,433
Man:
Let's go!

102
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,626
Man: What kind of man walks
into a field of fire

103
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,169
in defense of his country?

104
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,630
What kind of man has already
served his country

105
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,050
as a soldier in the Philippines
way before Pearl Harbor,

106
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,845
then volunteers to fight
the Japs as a Marine

107
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,972
in the islands
of the Pacific?

108
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,476
What kind of man
risked his life

109
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,979
throughout a night
of combat

110
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:15,525
running barefoot much-needed
ammunition back and forth

111
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,986
to his buddy on
the frontlines,

112
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,656
manning his machine gun
throughout the fight,

113
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,659
suffering horrible
wounds

114
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,662
while killing countless
savage Japs

115
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,832
in the key battle
that won us Guadalcanal?

116
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,335
I will tell you, brothers:

117
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,255
A fighting man
like no other,

118
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,467
winner of the Congressional
Medal of Honor,

119
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,888
America's own
Sergeant John Basilone!

120
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,455
Little R&R, Johnny?

121
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,971
Reporter:
How long's he been here for?

122
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,325
(golf club striking)

123
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,422
Reporter:
A whole lot of buckets.

124
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,814
John!

125
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,064
(distant explosions)

126
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,704
(twigs breaking)

127
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,668
(man shouts
in Japanese)

128
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,338
(men grunting,
shouting in Japanese)

129
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,177
Ooh!

130
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,097
What was that?
What happened?

131
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,434
- What the fuck is going on out there?
- I don't know.

132
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,353
Who the hell was that?

133
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,773
Two Japs, I think.

134
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,985
One ran down the road.
The otherjumped in Packer's foxhole.

135
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,862
All right, stay in
your foxholes.

136
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,364
- Man: Stay in your holes.
- Stay alert.

137
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,699
There might be more.

138
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,913
How long you people
been doing this!?

139
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,874
You don't get out of
your fucking hole at night

140
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:04,170
because this is
what happens!

141
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,799
One of us
gets tired.

142
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,052
One of us
gets lazy.

143
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,138
One of us doesn't
keep his edge on,

144
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,810
and this...
this is what happens.

145
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,826
What kind of guy gets out of his hole at
night without sounding off?

146
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,911
The kind with
two Japs up his ass.

147
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,413
Just one.

148
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,582
Leyden knows what it's like
to have a Jap up his ass.

149
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,251
- Fuck off!
- Can it, Bill.

150
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,920
Wh... what kind of asshole
shoots the guy?

151
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,089
An asshole like you.

152
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,924
- (gun fires)
- Ahh!

153
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,764
Move out! Down line!
Go for cover!

154
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,892
- Let's go!
- Man: Move down line! We're moving left!

155
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,438
Burgin! Plant your unit
behind that bunker!

156
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,773
- Move out!
- (explosions)

157
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,234
Man: Move down the line!
Let's go, let's go!

158
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,155
Ahh!
God damn it! Oh, God!

159
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,952
- Get the bunker cleared!
- We got it! It's been cleared.

160
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,956
(explosion)

161
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,587
(machine-gun fire)

162
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,631
(explosion)

163
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,264
(chattering)

164
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,357
(explosions continue)

165
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,444
(gunfire grows distant)

166
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,197
Burgie. Burgie.

167
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,532
Japs in the bunker.

168
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,118
First platoon cleared it
with grenades.

169
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,370
- They must have checked.
- No, listen.

170
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,126
Wake up, Sledge.

171
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,253
Burgie...

172
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,547
I'm sure.

173
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,550
They're in there.

174
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,398
(distant gunfire
continues)

175
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,656
(men whisper
in Japanese)

176
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,950
- Son of a bitch!
- (firing)

177
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,331
(men shout
in Japanese)

178
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,168
(gunfire continues)

179
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,303
Sledgehammer, check that side!

180
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,393
Ahhh!

181
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,316
Sledgehammer, Burgie,
up here!

182
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,903
Keep 'em bottled up
till I come back!

183
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,907
(machine-gun fire)

184
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,579
(firing)

185
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,088
Leyden.

186
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,928
Both:
Fire in the hole!

187
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,555
- (explodes)
- (Japanese soldiers scream)

188
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,807
- (speaks Japanese)
- To your right!

189
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,313
Grenade!
Grenade!

190
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,401
(grunts)

191
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,446
- Oh, fuck!
- Look at me, look at me. Look at me.

192
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,740
- I can't fucking see.
- You're all right.

193
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,827
Burgin:
Target 100yds to your right!

194
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,163
Look at me, look at me.
You're all right.

195
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,373
- You're all right.
- I can't fucking see.

196
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,500
- You're gonna be all right.
- Burgin: Get off the bunker, God damn it!

197
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,668
- Ahh!
- Come on.

198
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,836
Bill, come on.

199
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,922
You gotta help me.
We gotta move. Come on.

200
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,467
- No no.
- Hold on, Bill.

201
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,639
(Japanese soldiers
screaming)

202
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,478
(fires)

203
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,732
- (firing)
- (men screaming)

204
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,111
Look at me.
Look at me.

205
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,326
Gene!

206
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,662
Ahh!

207
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,081
- (shouts in Japanese)
- Gene!

208
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,999
Ahh!

209
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,848
Leyden:
Gene?

210
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,725
Gene?

211
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,852
Gene!

212
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,441
- Gene?
- Burgin: Fry 'em, Womack!

213
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,195
Ahhhh!

214
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,199
Leyden:
Gene!

215
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,245
(Japanese men scream)

216
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,999
Let the bastards
burn!

217
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,627
Ahhh!

218
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,550
(men scream
in Japanese)

219
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,023
Die, you Jap fuck!
Fuckin' die!

220
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,607
Fuckin' die!

221
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,841
You okay?

222
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,262
Why don't they
just surrender?

223
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,181
Because they're Japs.

224
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,685
We're gonna have to
root 'em out one by one.

225
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,522
Fucking rats.

226
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,252
Man:
Look at the gold teeth on this one.

227
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,340
What have you got there?

228
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,428
(plane passes overhead)

229
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,601
(shouts
in Japanese)

230
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,523
(Japanese soldier
gagging)

231
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,903
- Ahh!
- Christ! Put him out of his misery.

232
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,905
Fuck off.

233
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,409
(groaning)

234
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,793
Makes it easier.

235
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,436
(distant explosions
continue)

236
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,532
Snafu:
Bullshit.

237
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,703
The McCulloch boosted
my old man's Mercury V840%.

238
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,330
It only adds
four PSI, Snaf.

239
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,875
You get better torque.
You know that.

240
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,544
Yeah, well, you run that thing
for a while and it'll get noisy.

241
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,379
So?

242
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,216
- How you doin', boys?
- Skipper.

243
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,427
Gunny made some coffee
if anyone wants some.

244
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,429
It's actually
pretty good.

245
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,891
Burgie here says
superchargers are worthless.

246
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,517
What you think, Skipper?

247
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,979
Out here,
I'd have to agree with him.

248
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,278
Here, take this.

249
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,489
I'll get some more.

250
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,240
Go on, take it.

251
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,664
Any word on Leyden,
Skipper?

252
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,500
They already cleaned him up.

253
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,919
That New York Irish
hide of his

254
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,921
is tougher than any little
bit of Jap shrapnel.

255
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,756
He'll be back soon.

256
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,635
We're moving into the hills
come dawn.

257
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,053
Aye aye, sir.

258
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,096
Burgie, I'm gonna need some
of your mortar squad

259
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,682
to volunteer as
stretcher-bearers.

260
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,613
You can't dwell on it.

261
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,284
You can't dwell
on any of it.

262
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,171
Try and get some rest, boys.

263
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,188
(gunfire)

264
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,276
Gotta move!

265
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,364
Move it up there!

266
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,494
Russo, get up there
and find Hillbilly!

267
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,538
Pull him back!
Go!

268
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,170
(explosions)

269
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,340
Stretchers, go!

270
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,134
Go!

271
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,517
(shouts order)

272
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,438
Direct run!

273
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,900
Man:
Go go go!

274
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,870
Ahh!

275
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,886
(bombs whistling)

276
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,015
(indistinct shouting)

277
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,310
Man:
Don't stop! Keep moving!

278
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,062
Keep moving!

279
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,899
Here!

280
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,818
Pick him up!
Move!

281
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,910
Sledge, Snafu, up here!

282
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,080
Sledge, get your stretcher
up here now!

283
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,498
Come on, go!

284
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,919
Man: I need more ammo!
Give me more ammo!

285
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,214
Man:
Corpsman!

286
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,341
Over here!

287
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,178
Get that litter
opened up!

288
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,098
Man:
Let's get him back.

289
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,436
- Boys.
- I got the sulfur.

290
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,857
Corpsman: We're good to go.
Get him on the stretcher.

291
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,276
Man:
We're gonna need to move him fast!

292
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,697
(gunfire continues)

293
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,203
God damn it. Ah!

294
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,788
Get him up!

295
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,456
- Clear.
- Oh!

296
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,214
Ahhh!

297
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,305
- Oh, fuck!
- Man: Fall back!

298
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,474
- Get up here.
- Fall back!

299
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,144
Let's go!
Let's go!

300
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,688
Let's go!

301
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,444
Man:
Let's go!

302
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,919
(man shouting,
indistinct)

303
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,431
Eddie?

304
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,309
(panting)

305
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,186
Eddie.

306
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,901
(grunting)

307
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,909
Take him back.

308
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,376
(gunfire continues)

309
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,430
Let me help you.

310
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,766
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

311
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,392
Come on.

312
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,320
Jay:
Did you see Haney?

313
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,450
Sledge:
I saw him.

314
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,247
Haney is the old breed.

315
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,624
If a guy
like that breaks...

316
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,502
(distant
gunfire continues)

317
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,004
And Hillbilly's dead.

318
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,593
You can't dwell
on it, Jay.

319
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,305
You can't dwell
on any of it.

320
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,185
We go into those hills again,
I'm gonna get hit.

321
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,104
I know it.

322
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,361
I don't care anymore...

323
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,825
just as long
as it's quick.

324
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,999
- (gunfire)
- (screaming)

325
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,042
- Man: Get that fucker!
- Man #2: Everywhere!

326
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,336
- (man shouts in Japanese)
- (Marine shouting)

327
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,674
- Fucking Japs!
- Japs are everywhere.

328
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,097
Japanese soldier:
Yankee... (speaks Japanese)

329
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,267
- (gunfire)
- (soldier screams)

330
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,872
(sobbing)

331
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,049
Hey hey.

332
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:11,428
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

333
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,350
You're okay.

334
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,024
You'll be okay.

335
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,908
- (plane flying overhead)
- (distant gunfire)

336
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,502
How you holdin' up?

337
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,837
(grunts)

338
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,889
Oh, God.

339
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,066
- (man screams in Japanese)
- Oh, shit!

340
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,734
- (gun fires)
- Oh!

341
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,237
- (screaming)
- Jay: Somebody fucking shoot him.

342
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,030
Man:
Get him! Get the bastard!

343
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,782
Jay:
Shoot! Shoot!

344
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,659
Shoot him!

345
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,163
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

346
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,582
Why'd you take so long
to shoot him?

347
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,502
Damn, Jay, if it ain't coming out your
mouth, it's coming out your ass.

348
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,753
(men laugh)

349
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,007
Looks like you
in a sack race, Jay.

350
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,345
Aw, shit.

351
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,265
I shit myself.

352
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,641
- (all laughing)
- No kidding.

353
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,477
Fuck...
I fuckin' shit myself.

354
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,314
You guys are
fucking nuts.

355
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,900
Go back and get some
new dungarees, Jay.

356
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,944
It's all over
my hands.

357
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,280
You left a trail, boy.

358
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,449
They gonna
find us now.

359
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:04,750
(gunfire continues)

360
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,877
- Who's up ahead?
- Their platoon is on point, sir.

361
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,962
Right up there.

362
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,630
All right, Kelmar,
what do we got?

363
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,299
Men in the hill,
right up there,

364
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,634
covering from that ridge
all the way to the left.

365
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,678
That's good.
Go slow.

366
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,153
(distant gunfire continues)

367
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,665
Mortar!
Hold it up here!

368
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,048
(guns firing)

369
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,261
Man:
Corpsman!

370
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,204
Sniper got the skipper.

371
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,206
Captain Haldane?

372
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,542
Ack Ack's dead.

373
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,053
(sobbing)

374
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,112
Man:
Skipper's dead.

375
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,977
Burgin: All right,
let's get your shit together!

376
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,146
Man: Squad leaders, let's go!
Let's get it movin'!

377
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,941
- Burgin: We're going up!
- Man: Get your gear. We're goin'.

378
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,008
(distant gunfire
continues)

379
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,025
Man:
Let's go! Move up!

380
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,828
(flies buzzing)

381
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,564
(gunfire continues)

382
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,027
Mortars, hold it here!

383
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,071
Smarts with me, God damn it!
See what's up top!

384
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,532
Man:
Let's go!

385
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,624
(opening can)

386
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:47,217
(dripping)

387
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,485
(distant gunfire)

388
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,440
What you doin',
Sledgehammer?

389
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,775
I thought I'd bag me
some Jap gold.

390
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,444
You don't want to do that.

391
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,779
Why not?

392
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,073
I saw you do it.

393
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,872
Don't.

394
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,374
You shouldn't do it.

395
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,046
The germs.

396
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:11,259
Doc Caswell says all these
dead nips have germs.

397
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,222
- Germs.
- Bad germs.

398
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,267
Diseases that'll
make you sick.

399
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,358
Bad germs.

400
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,785
Well, is it all right with you
if I cut out his insignia then?

401
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,499
No danger in that I know of.

402
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,125
Yeah?

403
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,920
That pass muster with you?

404
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,108
Here, man.

405
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,846
(men chattering)

406
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,034
Keep it.

407
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,293
Thanks.

408
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,616

409
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,879
- Nurse: Welcome back.

410
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,798
Welcome back.

411
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,091
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

412
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,801

- Very kind of you.

413
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,178
- Nurse: Here you go.
- What the hell are they doing here?

414
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,555
Nurse:
Hi.

415
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,517

416
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,727
Thank you, ma'am.

418
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,939
Thanks, ma'am.

419
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,068
Hi, welcome back.

420
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,986
It's good to see you.

421
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,993
- Thank you.
- Mac: Okay, Marine.

422
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,955
You've had your look-see.
Now move along.

423
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,781
