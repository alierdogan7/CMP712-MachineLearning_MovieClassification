00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,199
- Yes?
- [barks]

26
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,796
I saw smoke
from your chimney and, well...

27
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,915
[dog growls]

28
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,356
- I would love to light one of these.
- Of course, young man.

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,959
[growls]

30
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,432
May I ask, why haven't you left? There's
a war going on right outside your door.

31
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,991
This is my home. My life's work is here.
Why should I leave?

32
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,878
Thank you.

33
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,034
- Fucker!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,637
Remember to do that to Russians. Fucker.
Thank you for your hospitality.

35
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,916
I'm really sorry about this.

36
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,275
I'm sure you are.

37
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,757
Shh.

38
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,871
[ticks]

39
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,837
Hey, Halonen.

40
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,392
It's too quiet here, right?

41
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,470
Does it trouble you, Captain?

42
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,031
No.

43
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,357
Move out.

44
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,590
Come on, Jackson.
Let's move out of here.

45
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,431
Film, goddammit.

46
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,630
Whose brilliant idea was it
to bring him along?

47
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,191
Mine. He's doing
a very important job here, Captain Stone.

48
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,999
Documenting our struggle
against the Russian invaders.

49
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,038
- You should know that.
- Yes, of course, sir.

50
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,875
Well, I think we're pretty close now.

51
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,429
The Soviet bunker should be no more
than one or two kilometres from here.

52
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,276
I don't see any point in moving
any further before nightfall.

53
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,351
You are right, Stone.

54
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,951
- Something wrong, Captain?
- No, nothing.

55
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,477
Sir, is there something
you're not telling me

56
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,949
regarding this mission?

57
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,192
Don't worry, Stone.
It'll all be over by dawn.

58
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,231
- Laakso.
- Yes, sir.

59
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,351
The map, Captain.

60
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,918
The Soviet bunker is
about two kilometres due west of here.

61
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,230
We attack before dawn. Inform the men.

62
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,038
They'll be ready, sir.

63
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,111
You do the same.

64
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,954
Gentlemen, we attack before dawn.

65
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,431
[gasps for breath]

66
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,631
[mutters]

67
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,152
Everybody take cover!

68
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,432
Selzman, get the fuck down!

69
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,590
What the hell are you doing?

70
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,795
- Get back!
- Laakso, what the hell are you doing?

71
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,552
Everybody get back!

72
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,958
The lieutenant's right!
We can't hold this position!

73
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,629
All right! Move back!

74
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,436
- Captain, we must inform headquarters.
- Not yet.

75
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,877
We've lost more than half the unit.
It's over.

76
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,836
We are not turning back.
We got this far.

77
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,036
The enemy will attack again. Then what?

78
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,549
I will not be humiliated.

79
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,951
- What's going on?
- We are not going back.

80
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,632
We don't have enough men, Captain.

81
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,110
- Can you fire a gun, Selzman?
- Yeah.

82
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,113
I killed a man,
in the Spanish Civil War.

83
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,157
You may have to do that again.

84
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,358
Well, this is a war too.

85
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,032
[distant gunshots and screaming]

86
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,992
- What the hell was that?
- Field glasses.

87
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,712
Captain, here.

88
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,834
- [Stone] What's going on?
- [captain] I don't know.

89
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,393
Are you sure this was the only attack
planned for here?

90
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,028
Yes, I'm sure.

91
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,148
This country's got
some serious problems.

92
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,550
You got that goddamn right.

93
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,433
Niemi, we need to talk.

94
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,635
Someone's coming.

95
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,515
Wait. He stopped.

96
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,591
[Laakso] Did we leave someone behind?

97
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,990
No.

98
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,553
Give me the camera.
Give me the goddamn camera!

99
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,039
Selzman, shut the fuck up.

100
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,840
- Something's not right.
- What?

101
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,355
- I think that's a Russian.
- He might be one of us.

102
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,432
[Stone] It's... it's a trick, sir.

103
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,068
Sir, on your order, sir.

104
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,033
Sir?

105
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,031
- Niemi?
- Sir.

106
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,509
Niemi?

107
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,194
Open fire!

108
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,960
Laakso, go take a look.

109
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,269
[Laakso] Yes, sir.

110
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,951
Jesus. Halonen.

111
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,112
He's alive.

112
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,635
Help!

113
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,436
Laakso, incoming!

114
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,791
Fucking fantastic.

115
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,996
[snarling]

116
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,076
Get out of here! Get out of here!
Go, go, go, go! Run!

117
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,911
Come on, let's get out of here.

118
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,348
[snarling]

119
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,317
Wait!

120
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,391
Wait!

121
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,391
Clear!

122
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,271
Grenade!

123
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,589
Drop your weapon!
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

124
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,550
- Shoot him!
- Don't shoot, please.

125
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,518
- That's an order, Captain!
- No, Captain, please don't shoot!

126
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,750
- Side arm.
- OK.

127
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,117
[Niemi] He's a fucking Russian.
Captain Stone.

128
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,272
- Kill him!
- No. I can help, please.

129
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll get you court-martialled
if you don't shoot.

130
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,878
No, hold on, hold on, hold on.

131
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,429
- Help us how? What do you mean?
- I can show you house.

132
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,909
A house? What the hell
would we do with a house?

133
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,957
He's right.
We have to get out of here, Captain.

134
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,917
No, we stay and fight.

135
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,795
We take cover, yes?

136
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,315
Follow me, please.

137
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,312
Let's go.

138
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,118
Come on, come on, come on.

139
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,870
[Russian] We must hurry.
Those things will be following us for sure.

140
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,991
[snarling]

141
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,471
Come on.

142
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,671
This is it.

143
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,990
Move. Barricade the door!

144
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,152
[Laakso] Get in. Come on.
Take the windows.

145
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,594
[Niemi] Faster.

146
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,118
- You, what are those things out there?
- I don't know.

147
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,317
- Don't lie.
- That's really helpful, Captain.

148
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,870
I am not lying. Your soldier attack
our men, we shoot, he was not dying.

149
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,077
- I think he's talking about Halonen.
- Bullshit.

150
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,516
I think you know what those things are.

151
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,512
Fuck you.

152
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,352
What is he talking about, Captain?

153
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,877
Nothing. What the hell does he know?
He's not even Finnish.

154
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,475
What's that stuff on you?

155
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,437
I don't know. It came from Halonen.

156
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,431
He's biting me!

157
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,630
[Stone] Use the grenades!

158
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,429
Motherfucker!

159
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,954
Make sure they're nice and close
before you let 'em have it.

160
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,596
Shoot 'em in the head.

161
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,675
Sir, I'm running out of ammo here!

162
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,111
[yells] Fuck!

163
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,871
[yells]

164
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,437
Captain.

165
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,839
Stone, keep an eye on that Soviet fucker.
Can you do that?

166
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,672
Yes, I can do that.

167
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,151
Are you all right?

168
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,474
I'm fine.

169
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,878
You sure?

170
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,476
Well, considering the circumstances,
yes, sir.

171
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,429
Hey, kid, take this
and go earn yourself a Purple Heart.

172
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,989
Laakso, let's take upstairs.

173
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,435
What's your name, kid?

174
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,511
Kolya.

175
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,433
Where'd you learn to speak English?

176
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,795
My mother, she teach in school.

177
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,755
Why American soldier here?

178
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,831
You tell me.

179
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,431
[thudding]

180
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,151
What is it, Captain?

181
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,951
Shh. Come.

182
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,631
We have automobile here.

183
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,390
A car? Where?

184
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,951
Here.

185
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,351
[clattering]

186
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,871
You OK, kid?

187
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,271
- [thudding]
- Oh, shit.

188
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,832
Where are the others? Where's Stone?

189
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,468
They went outside.

190
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,518
Outside? Why?

191
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,591
Kolya said there was a car.

192
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,555
Yeah.

193
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,555
Those fuckers.

194
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,757
Captain, I don't think Stone and Kolya
are trying anything.

195
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,598
Shut up, Laakso. It's all your fault.

196
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,638
You've been protecting them
from the very beginning.

197
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,519
- Captain, are you all right?
- I'm in charge here.

198
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,194
What's wrong? Captain?

199
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,271
I'm in charge.

200
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,117
Help! I need help over here!

201
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,514
Hurry up, you fucker!

202
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,069
I can't hold it much longer! Come on!

203
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,151
You gotta help me out!

204
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,791
Hurry!

205
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,871
Come on!

206
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,349
Fucking help me!

207
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,878
I... I can't.

208
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,951
No!

209
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,232
[engine fails to start]

210
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,871
Car work better with gasoline.

211
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,629
Great.

212
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,951
That's your Purple Heart.

213
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,351
Hey, kid.

214
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,159
Listen, Kolya, I really need
to trust you on this one.

215
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,751
How did you end up here?

216
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,395
I came with my father.

217
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,996
He thought it would be a good idea
for me to get some hands-on experience.

218
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,071
Selzman was your father?

219
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,074
Yeah.

220
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,229
I'm sorry.

221
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,834
At least he died doing what he loved.

222
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,355
Get ready. We're going out.

223
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,397
- With a bang?
- You betcha.

224
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,390
Captain? Can you hear me?

225
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,390
- Don't make me do this.
- [snarls]

226
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,639
No!

227
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's me.
I saw what happened. We need to go.

228
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,239
Follow me.

229
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,115
Let's go, kid.

230
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,118
They're here!

231
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,111
Let's go! Come on, Kolya!

232
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,110
- Come on, work, you peace of shit.
- Go, go, go, go.

233
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,157
Anybody need a ride?

234
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,912
[engine starts]

235
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,558
[Kolya] Come on, we need to move.

236
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,393
My grandmother walks faster
than this car.

237
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,271
Christ.

238
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,469
What is that?

239
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,353
[Stone] What's going on?

240
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,391
What are you doing?

241
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,671
[Laakso] What the hell is going on here?

242
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,468
Son of a bitch.

243
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,437
[growls]

244
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,397
[engine fails to start]

245
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,799
He's on the roof! Come on, shoot him!

246
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,116
[Stone] Shit! I'm out of bullets!
I have to reload.

247
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,158
[Laakso] Come on!
Where is he? He's coming back!

248
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,318
Shoot him! Come on! Take him out!

249
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,233
- Kill him! Take him down!
- [Kolya] Shoot him!

250
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,550
[Laakso] Come on!

251
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,670
- OK.
- Come on, Mary!

252
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,593
[Laakso] Go, go, go! What are you
waiting for? Drive! Come on!

253
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,239
[clunking]

254
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,595
Come on, Mary. Don't die on me.

255
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,471
Who's Mary, Captain?

256
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,996
Hey, look. Light.

257
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,030
I know this spot. It's OK.

258
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,430
No, kid, it's not OK.

259
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,111
[horses neigh]

260
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,594
- [thunder]
- [horses neigh]

261
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,672
How'd you know about this village, kid?

262
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,274
I have been here.

263
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,477
- Really?
- Yes.

264
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,551
As a soldier?

265
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,798
No. Long time ago.

266
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,551
You keep an eye on him.

267
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,431
[Stone] Come on.

268
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,311
Everybody grab some food.

269
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,315
After we have finished,
Captain Stone and I are going home.

270
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,948
- What about me?
- You are home.

271
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,669
- You can go back to your unit.
- No, no, unit gone.

272
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,153
We must warn people. And your soldiers,
they will die too, you know.

273
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,594
I'm in charge now.

274
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,829
And you will do nothing?
You must tell people.

275
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,911
And then what?

276
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,159
Maybe American army help.

277
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,710
I'm sorry, kid. I'm all you got.

278
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,270
You leave me to die?
I thought we were friend.

279
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,396
This is war, kid.

280
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,718
And besides,
the lieutenant's in charge now.

281
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,519
And why you are here? Is not your war.

282
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,194
That's right. It's not my war.

283
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,717
Captain, do you have any idea
what's happening here?

284
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,595
No. I've never seen or heard
anything like this before.

285
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,671
They're undead. How can that be?

286
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,913
God only knows.

287
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,640
I don't believe in God.

288
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,711
It's fine by me.

289
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,755
Do you miss your family back home?

290
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,751
My wife is dead.

291
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,315
Do you miss her?

292
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,715
Like I said, my wife is dead.

293
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,273
I miss my dog, Sergei,
very strong Siberian husky.

294
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,238
Who's Mary? Your wife?

295
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,759
For your information, Lieutenant,
she was everything I lived for.

296
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,230
- So you're looking for death, then?
- Aren't we all?

297
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,277
And that's the reason you came here?

298
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,831
Do you believe in the devil, Captain?

299
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,509
I do now.

300
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,715
[smashing glass]

301
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,071
- OK, better we go now.
- Shut up.

302
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,470
Stay here.
Don't let anything through that door.

303
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,551
Maybe I should go
and you stay here, Captain.

304
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,075
I can handle this.

305
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,435
All right, then. It's your funeral.

306
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,837
[sobbing]

307
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,037
- No, no!
- Shh, shh!

308
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,671
Please, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Let me help you.

309
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,513
- Dasha?
- Kolya.

310
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,152
Ex-girlfriend. That's all we need.

311
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,631
She might be infected, Captain.

312
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,635
What happened here?

313
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,836
What difference does it make?
We should go.

314
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,195
We need to find out what happened.

315
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,113
If there was another attack,
there might be more survivors.

316
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,238
And then what? We can't save everybody.

317
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,030
What is your problem?
Niemi's dead. Get over it.

318
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,031
- What?
- Nothing.

319
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,991
What happened, sweetheart?

320
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,351
They came.

321
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,036
They raped the women
and then killed all the children.

322
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,395
- Who did this?
- Our soldiers.

323
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,791
- Russian?
- No, Finns.

324
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,916
Impossible. She's telling a lie.

325
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,356
In Karelia, there is a lot of Finns.

326
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,512
And there was also
a lot of Russians leaving.

327
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,069
That's why they destroy everything.

328
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,840
And then they came.

329
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,749
They were here?

330
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,071
That's why should get the hell
out of here before it's too late.

331
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,831
We gotta take her with us.

332
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,909
Captain, you know just as well as I do,
we can't take her along.

333
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,196
It's hard enough time
to get by ourselves.

334
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,794
The last thing we need
is another burden.

335
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,428
I hate to leave her,
but we have no choice, Captain.

336
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,558
- We are not leaving her here.
- It's not your wife, Stone.

337
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,550
Please. I know place
where you can make radio call. Please.

338
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,677
Radio?

339
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,196
Yes. I lived near here before war.

340
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,636
Tell me something, Kolya,
how come she's your ex?

341
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,711
What kind of a question is that?

342
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,709
Because now she live
on wrong side of border.

343
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,758
Where's this place, kid?

344
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,036
It is very near. I will show you, OK?

345
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,795
We have to hurry. Get in the car.

346
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,111
Hey, kid.
You sure this place has a radio?

347
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,434
Yes. It's big special bunker.
Radio, mast, everything.

348
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,239
Wait a minute. Special bunker?

349
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,917
That was our mission.
So Captain Niemi knew.

350
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,719
- Knew what?
- About all this.

351
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,791
About these things?

352
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,397
Bullshit. If he knew,
why wouldn't he let me know?

353
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,596
- Because of Selzman.
- What?

354
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,196
Don't you get it?
That's why he brought him along.

355
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,352
It was gonna be Selzman's big exclusive
to show everyone.

356
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,069
- Show what?
- About all these supercreeps.

357
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,434
I don't believe this.

358
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,353
Selzman was here because the
headquarters told him to come, right?

359
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,794
Exactly.

360
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,918
What you're telling me is that
whatever it was, he knew and we didn't?

361
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,150
- Yeah.
- It's crazy.

362
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,436
Niemi was my friend.
He was my mentor.

363
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,511
Are you saying he lied to me?

364
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,315
He was just following orders,
Lieutenant.

365
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,832
Kolya, what's so special
about this bunker?

366
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,434
I heard story
they make test there, but...

367
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,154
The undead, right?

368
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,788
So how many men
they got stationed there?

369
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,997
Not worry. Should not be many.

370
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,958
We're at war, kid. I'm worried.
How many men?

371
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,031
I'm not sure.

372
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,516
We need to get to a radio and fast.
I think it's worth the risk.

373
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,949
We all came here to die anyway, right?

374
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,558
Hey, kid. What you doing?

375
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,554
It's vodka. Please,
a shot of vodka never killed anyone.

376
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,076
Get in! Get in, Captain! Get in!

377
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,437
Wait!

378
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,796
Where are they all coming from?

379
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,670
Get away from that horse, motherfucker!

380
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,589
Kolya, get in the car!

381
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,510
Gee up! Come on, giddy up!

382
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,592
- [Laakso] Hurry, Captain!
- Go, boy!

383
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,993
Move over!

384
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,198
- [Kolya] Come on, hurry!
- [Laakso] Get the hell out of here!

385
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,271
[Stone] Abandoned German trucks.
You sure this is the right place, kid?

386
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,556
[Kolya] You need to trust me.

387
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,359
[Stone] All right. Take us to the radio.

388
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,590
What are we gonna do about the girl?

389
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,434
I look after Dasha.

390
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,511
Let's go.

391
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,911
[creaking]

392
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,270
[Kolya] I am sorry, my friend.

393
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,031
[snarling]

394
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,351
Let's get out of here.

395
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,831
[snarling]

396
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,311
Go, go, go!

397
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,397
How did they get here so quickly?
We drove as fast as we could.

398
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,352
Who said they weren't here anyway?
Come on.

399
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,391
[Laakso] What just happened?

400
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,671
Laakso.

401
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,711
You stay put.

402
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,272
Captain.

403
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,591
What the...?

404
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,311
This is...

405
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,951
What are they doing here?

406
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,871
Captain.

407
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,671
Shoot 'em in the head.

408
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,358
Why?

409
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,431
To make sure.

410
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,991
[gunshot]

411
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,271
Maybe I get weapon too.

412
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,035
Hm?

413
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,391
[snarling]

414
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,636
- Remember to aim for the heads!
- Communications room, where is it?

415
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,711
[Kolya] It's down there on the left.

416
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,674
Dasha, come on. It's not far.

417
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,111
[whirring and clunking]

418
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,434
[whirring and clunking]

419
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,151
What are you doing?

420
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,599
- It's a key.
- All right. How did you get that?

421
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,069
[Stone] This is what the kid
left in the house.

422
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,991
It's warm.

423
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,595
[screeches]

424
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,193
- Captain, you OK?
- Yeah. What were they doing here?

425
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,476
I don't know,
but this explains those things.

426
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,596
That stuff is what brings 'em
back to life.

427
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,116
- You think?
- The devil has many disguises.

428
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,430
The SS soldiers.

429
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,511
Come on, let's check this room out.

430
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,431
Dasha?

431
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,590
Dasha?

432
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,120
Hey, Laakso, you read German, right?

433
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,793
Yes, sir.

434
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,155
What does leicht entzundbarmean?

435
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,154
Leicht entzundbar.
Means very flammable, I think. Why?

436
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,112
I got an idea.

437
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,793
- Dasha is gone. I go look.
- You're not going after her.

438
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,678
If she ran away,
it's her problem, not ours.

439
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,637
- We should go find her.
- It's wasting time.

440
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,837
I'm not gonna get us killed because of a
woman I don't know or give a damn about.

441
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,911
- How can you not care?
- Are you sure about this?

442
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,991
Captain.

443
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,633
The lieutenant's right.
We can't waste any more time.

444
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,435
You're on your own on this one, kid.

445
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,511
Go find her.

446
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,551
[distant clanging]

447
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,235
Dasha?

448
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,311
[clattering]

449
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,551
Dasha?

450
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,151
[door opens]

451
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,957
[man] Stop and identify yourself.

452
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,475
Private Nikolay Dolgov.

453
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,951
Stay back.

454
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,274
I am not one of them.
I have light. I give you, OK?

455
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,158
All right.

456
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,912
Don't worry, OK?

457
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,319
When you begin to feel it...

458
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,152
...you... you pull pin, all right?

459
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,597
How will I know?

460
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,398
You will know. I'm sorry.

461
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,909
Dasha.

462
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,479
[gasping]

463
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,431
[gunshot]

464
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:47,474
- Shh, shh, shh.
- [speaks German]

465
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,477
- Feuer!
- Feuer!

466
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,955
[yells]

467
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,237
Goddammit! We should be fighting
these things together!

468
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,311
[distant gunfire]

469
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,196
Capitan.

470
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,355
Hey, Capitan!

471
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,152
[Stone] Holy shit! Get down!

472
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,678
- [Laakso] Captain?
- What?

473
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,956
I think this is the room.
I'm right in front of it.

474
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,751
[yells]

475
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,388
Just go and find
the communications room. Go!

476
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,430
Lock the door!

477
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,512
- What?
- Lock the door and keep it shut down!

478
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,116
[Kolya] I need help!

479
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,589
Anyone!

480
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,512
Open this door! It's Kolya!

481
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,111
Let me in!

482
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,671
[snarling]

483
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,515
Captain!

484
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,675
Stone!

485
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,395
- You fucks.
- [Laakso] Captain!

486
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,795
I'm coming out!

487
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,316
The door stays shut, Lieutenant.
That's a direct order.

488
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,517
Just find that communications room
and radio for help.

489
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,752
Save it for later, kid.
Right now I gotta go. Company's coming.

490
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,151
I ain't dead yet.

491
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,513
Stupid American.

492
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,316
Communication room is through here.

493
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,398
Get him out of here.

494
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,391
[indistinct voices]

495
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,036
Shut the door!

496
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,475
Red Snow for Command, respond. Over.

497
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,713
Task force Red Snow for Command,
respond. Over.

498
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,192
[man] Red Snow, this is Command.
What is your location? Over.

499
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,191
Hold on.

500
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,238
The map is not...
The bunker's not showed on the map.

501
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,632
Now, the location is approximately
30 kilometres behind enemy lines.

502
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,755
Respond. Over.

503
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,229
This is Command.
What is your status? Over.

504
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,073
Mission failed
due to strong enemy resistance.

505
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,118
Request for immediate air support.

506
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,593
This is Command. Code F97B2.
Requesting response code. Over.

507
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,913
Map coordinates 5G, sector 7.

508
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,913
Confirming 5G sector 7. Over.

509
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,151
I'm sorry, Kolya. We have to ensure
this place is being destroyed.

510
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,072
These things
can't be allowed to survive.

511
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,708
ETA 15 minutes. Over.

512
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,270
Command requesting signal for flyby.
Over.

513
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,591
Fuck.

514
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,951
Some kind of signal.

515
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,035
A signal.

516
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,676
Red Snow for Command, respond. Over.

517
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,115
Red Snow for Command, respond. Over.

518
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,230
Red Snow. Over.

519
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,630
Request for a flyover.

520
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,031
Map coordinates 5G, sector 7.

521
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,033
Check for red smoke.
I repeat, check for red smoke. Over.

522
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,749
- 5G, sector 7. Over.
- OK, let's get out of here.

523
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,151
They will bomb the place at 0900.

524
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,471
That gives us 40 minutes.

525
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,313
40 minutes is plenty of time.
Maybe we have time to get out.

526
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,948
- I hope so, my friend.
- [clattering]

527
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,629
[yelling]

528
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,949
Goddammit. I thought
they would have given up by now.

529
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,272
I thought never possible
to be in German bunker

530
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,956
fighting side by side
with a... Finnish soldier.

531
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,718
But go figure.

532
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,710
You want?

533
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,990
So how is war going on your side?

534
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,991
[man speaks Russian]

535
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,996
It's in Russian. What's he saying?

536
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,919
- They are sending battalion here.
- What? When?

537
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,799
- 0900 hours.
- [clattering]

538
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,552
[Kolya] We must warn them.

539
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,589
[speaks Russian]

540
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,876
Goddamn peace of shit radio.

541
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,674
Let's dance.

542
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,155
Hurry up!

543
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,951
This way!

544
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,473
[Kolya] There is no escape
through those windows.

545
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,835
We don't have much time
before they bomb this place. Let's go.

546
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,353
Just no more tunnels, OK?

547
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,351
Kolya, help me!

548
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,318
Kolya, when the door opens,
be ready for it! Come on!

549
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,072
No, no, no, no. This way.

550
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,911
Go up the ladders. Go, go, go, go, go!

551
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,549
Help me.

552
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,039
- [Laakso] Grab my hand.
- I can't.

553
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,396
On your feet, soldier.
It ain't over yet.
