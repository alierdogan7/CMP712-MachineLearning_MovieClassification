Shh.

184
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,724
Go away.

185
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:33,625
Shh.

186
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,332
Just, just go away!

187
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:40,990
Leave me alone.

188
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,258
Your Highness.

189
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,160
Your Grace. Daughter.

190
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,429
How grateful I am that

191
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,899
we can now announce that
you are with child.

192
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:28,967
(ALL APPLAUDING)

193
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,374
The alliance between our peoples,

194
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,043
born of baptism and marriage,

195
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,312
is the only way to safeguard our future.

196
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,881
In the meantime,

197
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,719
what efforts has Your Grace made

198
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,622
to ensure that the pagans
have quit our realm?

199
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,359
I have sent boats down river
to ascertain the truth of it.

200
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,730
It may well be that my brother will
choose to sack and plunder Rouen,

201
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,799
rather than return to his
people empty-handed.

202
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,868
But I have already sent word
to the lords of that town

203
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,238
to prepare their defenses
against such an attack.

204
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:12,341
Above all men, I know how
much I owe both to God,

205
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,644
and to those closest to me,
for our delivery from evil.

206
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:20,816
Now, I would also like
to express the same

207
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,184
to Sire Roland.

208
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,154
Though an underling,

209
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,522
I believe you did far more
than Count Odo to preserve

210
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,358
and defend our city.

211
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:34,595
Therefore, I proclaim you
in turn, Count Roland,

212
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,231
Defender of Paris.

213
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,565
(ALL APPLAUDING)

214
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:51,645
And may you continue to serve
us faithfully as before.

215
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:53,981
I am honored and humbled.

216
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,382
And ready to sacrifice myself

217
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,018
at any moment for Your
Highness's greater glory.

218
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
You may all leave,

219
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,762
content in my good graces.

220
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:19,305
Except for you, Count Roland.

221
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:22,140
Stay a moment.

222
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:32,017
I want to ask your
permission, Count Roland.

223
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,185
My permission?

224
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,886
But for what?

225
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,221
Why should the Emperor ever
have to ask permission?

226
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,591
I want to sleep with your sister.

227
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,696
I desire her to be my mistress.

228
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:49,200
Have you asked her?

229
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:55,171
I would like your permission...

230
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,406
...first.

231
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,244
You have it.

232
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,612
Of course, Your Highness.

233
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,114
I am sure she will think of herself as

234
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,883
the most fortunate woman in Paris.

235
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,287
Wait.

236
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:20,262
There is something else.

237
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,769
Why is my father giving
preference to those people?

238
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:31,339
I don't know.

239
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:33,941
I don't think you understand
the way things work here.

240
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,143
You are too simple.

241
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,145
Simple?

242
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:42,350
What is simple?

243
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,985
The person who is closest to my father

244
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,787
is the person who has the
most power in Frankia.

245
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:50,290
And it seems as if he has
suddenly given power

246
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,092
to a young soldier.

247
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,493
But I am Duke.

248
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,362
I have been given great lands,

249
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,831
and the responsibility for the
defense of the entire realm.

250
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,333
Even as you say those words,

251
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,734
they start to sound hollow.

252
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:05,938
Entire realm, great lands.

253
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:07,706
What does it mean?

254
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,409
Roland has actually been
given command of the city.

255
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:13,879
He will always be
closest to the Emperor.

256
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,447
Do not underestimate your father.

257
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:18,384
Oh, it would be impossible
to underestimate him.

258
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:21,752
Just as it would be
impossible to understand him.

259
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,422
It's not right that a man
of such humble origin

260
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,259
should take precedence over you, or me!

261
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:30,761
It's unfortunate, but this
Roland should be removed

262
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,597
before his appetite for power
becomes too pronounced.

263
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,400
Hmm.

264
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,703
What are you doing?

265
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,339
Hmm?

266
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,144
I'm trying to have sex.

267
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,479
I am with child.

268
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,214
So?

269
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,183
You are carrying my child!

270
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,752
This makes me very happy.

271
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,955
So, it's not possible.

272
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,257
No, it's really quite...

273
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,458
Simple.

274
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,427
It's not going to happen.

275
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:05,928
(GROANS)

276
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:10,265
I told you, this is Frankia,
we do things differently here.

277
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,800
You have to respect me
in my sacred condition.

00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,514

Just a few things which
were better before.

you come among us to be crowned

two proud and ancient kingdoms

292
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:26,226
which will now be one and
indissoluble under your governance

293
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:29,022
and by God's undoubted will.

294

ALL: Amen.

300
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:08,111
Take this sword,

301
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,413
which is bestowed on you
with the blessing of God,

302
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,415
that by the power of the Holy Spirit

303
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:17,172
you may resist and cast
out all your enemies.

and in the sight of God,

308
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:48,148
I crown you King of Wessex and Mercia.

(CHEERING)

312
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,301
I suppose you should be
congratulated, King Ecbert.

313
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,272
By a clever ruse you have become ruler

314
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,640
of one of the biggest,
richest kingdoms in England.

315
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:55,544
And all without my help.

316
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,014
Despite the fact that
we are formally allies.

317
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:01,583
No, fortunately, there
was limited bloodshed.

318
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:03,552
Which is always to be favored.

319
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:06,923
After all, we need our armies to fight

320
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,957
not each other, but the Northmen.

321
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:12,294
You always have a clever answer.

322
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,931
The fact is, you betrayed me!

323
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:20,869
You told me nothing of your plans.

324
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:24,139
We were to divide Mercia
equally between us.

325
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,739
But you have taken it all.

326
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:28,642
And now it occurs to me

327
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:32,246
your new kingdom directly abuts mine.

328
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,150
So it does.

329
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:41,688
But surely we are still allies?

330
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,726
I feel I ought to ask you that question.

331
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,902
It may be true that things have changed.

332
00:24:57,505 --> 00:25:00,438
Life is all about change,
is it not, King Aelle?

333
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:03,708
If we don't change, we fall behind.

334
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:05,944
What was once true, and real,

335
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:08,380
is suddenly no longer true,

336
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:09,882
no longer real.

337
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,818
And sometimes, we have to accept that.

338
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,755
You mean our alliance?

339
00:25:17,823 --> 00:25:19,490
Yes.

340
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:22,093
We had an alliance as equals.

341
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:26,530
But, as you can plainly see,
we are no longer equals.

342
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,233
Everything has changed.

343
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:30,467
For both of us.

344
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,139
You must get used to it.

You are a mystery to me.

When I asked you to
come with me, you did.

377
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:56,346
You didn't ask for anything in return.

What do you want?

379
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:03,553
What can I give you?

380
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:07,922
Perhaps you could have asked me
that question a long time ago.

381
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:14,863
When I first met you, I
saw something in you.

382
00:29:17,768 --> 00:29:18,933
You still have it.

383
00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:23,904
It's a refusal to abide by the rules.

384
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:27,575
A wildness,

385
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,911
only just contained.

386
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:38,753
I still love that about you.

387
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,553
- Do you?
- I do.

388
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:44,758
I chose you as my companion.

389
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,793
I accept that you might not love me.

390
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,632
I know that my being the
son of Ragnar Lothbrok

391
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,267
has little meaning to you.

392
00:29:56,304 --> 00:29:57,836
And I like that about you.

393
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:03,909
Why do you say these
beautiful things now?

If I agree to come back to you,

426

would you give up on your revenge?

427

A Viking never gives up on his revenge.

This is who we are.

429
00:33:52,265 --> 00:33:53,931
My father was killed by Ragnar Lothbrok,

430
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,535
and by his son, his
ex-wife, his friends.

431
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,138
And I will have my revenge.

432
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,306
That was a long time ago, Erlendur.

433
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:09,979
It always seems to me like yesterday.

434
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,316
And how perfect to punish
Ragnar by killing his son.

435
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,620
Yes!

436
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,788
Yes!

Today is the day!

438
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,726
You have to kill him.

439
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,861
- No.
- Yes. It's decided.

- What if I won't do it?
- I told you!

445

I told you, you have no choice.

Now, drink.

enough, you can't miss.
