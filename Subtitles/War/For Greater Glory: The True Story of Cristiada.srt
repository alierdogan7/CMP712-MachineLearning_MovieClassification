1
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:45,192
Core! Core! Core!

2
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:53,312
Compatriots,
Mexico is under siege.

3
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:57,913
A plot as insidious
as it is dangerous

4
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,828
threatens our nation.

5
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:03,426
Outcasts from Rome

6
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:05,950
and from all over Europe

7
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:10,984
are coming into our country
to destabilize the government,

8
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:14,784
to poison the minds and hearts
of our people,

9
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:19,823
to turn them into fanatics
at the service of foreign interests.

10
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:24,383
This situation, this evil,

11
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,033
this threat

12
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:28,745
cannot be ignored,

13
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:31,189
and it will not be tolerated.

14
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:36,429
Therefore
I have instructed our Congress

15
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,709
to create a set of laws

16
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:42,673
designed to deal with
this national emergency.

17
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:43,993
Camine.

18
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:47,953
Firstly, every foreign-born bishop,

19
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:51,628
priest or minister
will be deported immediately.

20
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:56,388
Second, there will be
a five-year jail sentence

21
00:03:56,393 --> 00:04:00,068
for any priest who criticizes
the government.

22
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:06,864
The wearing of religious vestments
in public is strictly forbidden.

23
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:09,549
Make no mistake.

24
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:16,984
This government is going to do
whatever is necessary

25
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:23,385
to preserve the dignity of Mexico,

26
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,508
the freedom of its people

27
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:32,143
and the immortal ideals
of La Revolution Mexicana.

28
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,464
Muchachos!

29
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:07,462
Don't waste God's good food
making fun of me.

30
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,339
I- I'm ashamed of you.

31
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:23,622
He's a man of God.

32
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:33,056
Padre. Padre.

33
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,824
Jose will work for you
for the next two weeks, Padre.

34
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,896
Anything you need him
to do for the church.

35
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,942
That won't be necessary.

36
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,698
It was a harmless prank.

37
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:50,017
And I hear fruit is good for the hair.

38
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:55,176
I- I know that the priests
consider prayer a penitence,

39
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:58,143
but for a boy like my godson,
hard work is better.

40
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,262
Uh, you've no doubt,
uh, heard about the Calles Law.

41
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:04,856
Yes.

42
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,617
Just be careful about
wearing your cassock in public.

43
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,735
God save us from these heathens.

44
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,895
Have you had breakfast, Joselito?

45
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,937
Elodia makes wonderful chilaquiles,

46
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:33,571
and my friend Father Vega
will be here any minute.

47
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:36,735
Don't call me Joselito.

48
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:38,733
Oh, that's right.

49
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:40,221
You're tough.

50
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,858
I forgot.

51
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:45,935
The soldiers are coming into towns,

52
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:48,136
making sure the laws are being enforced.

53
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,609
I came from Europe over 70 years ago,

54
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:52,896
when I was just 7 years old.

55
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:56,132
Would they really kick out
an old man like me?

56
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:00,656
From what I hear,
they probably will.

57
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,289
There have been spontaneous
protests all over Mexico.

58
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,370
A resistance is forming,

59
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,497
and Rome, uh-Rome is taking
too long to respond.

60
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,138
An armed resistance?

61
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,529
Let's pray it doesn't come to that.

62
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:15,528
But...

63
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,451
It may become inevitable.

64
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,814
That's a mistake.

65
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,970
Our Savoir is the Prince of Peace.

66
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:34,048
But the Bible also says
there is a time for peace,

67
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:35,776
a time for war.

68
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:42,249
We cannot allow the godless
to take away our freedom.

69
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:44,976
If need be,

70
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:48,890
we must stand up and resist.

71
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,297
Even if I were younger,

72
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,652
I would not fight.

73
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:02,809
You won't need to fight to help.

74
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,172
You can feed and shelter
the ones who come through.

75
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:07,768
Now, that I would do.

76
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,244
List?

77
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:14,529
List, Su Excelencia.

78
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:28,490
His Holiness Pope Pius XI

79
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:31,327
condemns the Calles Law.

80
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:36,123
Beginning midnight on August 1st,

81
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:38,728
all holy services in Mexico

82
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,412
will be suspended.

83
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:43,812
No puede ser.

84
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:20,046
Respeto derecho de fe!

85
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:23,327
What beautiful little girl is going to
beat me in chess today?

86
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:24,320
Me.

87
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,446
- You?
- Yes.

88
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:27,486
Okay, we'll see.

89
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,809
Periódico! Periódico!

90
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,042
The cathedral is being closed
at the orders of President Calles

91
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,359
so the government
can make an inventory

92
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,645
and safeguard its contents.

93
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,042
Let's go.

94
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:52,320
The girls will not be able to get
their confirmation, Enrique.

95
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:54,962
It's only temporary, Tulita.

96
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,528
Calles won't be able to sustain this.

97
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,237
Besides, I was sure
our daughters will survive

98
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,808
without the, uh, nuns
slapping their palms,

99
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,287
all that holy nonsense.

100
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,960
It is not a joke.

101
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:09,687
It may mean nothing to you,
but it means everything to me.

102
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:12,121
Daddy, does that mean
no more catechism?

103
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,799
So we can play now?

104
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,798
You can study science for now.

105
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,763
You know how important this is to me.

106
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,166
It's only temporary.

107
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,045
Besides, I'm sure there'll be
plenty of clandestine services.

108
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:25,277
Oh, so the girls can feel like
they are doing something shameful

109
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:27,322
when they go to Mass?

110
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,839
What do you want me to do?

111
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,115
Come.

112
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,765
Tula.

113
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:38,715
Tula.

114
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,837
Go look at the hats.

115
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,239
Tulita...

116
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:55,123
as a military man, I can tell you

117
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:58,275
that it's only a matter of time
before Calles is overthrown.

118
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:02,158
In the meantime,
you can teach the girls at home.

119
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:06,599
Unless, of course, you want me to.

120
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,121
Excuse me.

121
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:16,192
Hi.

122
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:17,602
For the repeal of the Calles Law.

123
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:18,638
Oh, excellent.

124
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:23,114
Thank you.

125
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:26,831
Good luck.

126
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:29,590
Excuse me, sir.

127
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:32,275
Please, for the repeal
of the Calles Law.

128
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,358
Please don't misunderstand me.

129
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,592
I'm a good Catholic.

130
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,796
But you're wasting your time.

131
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,196
Excuse me?

132
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,950
What good do you think this will do?

133
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,436
Calles can't ignore a million signatures.

134
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,432
I'm sorry to say he can and he will.

135
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,358
But on the other hand,
an economic boycott,

136
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,157
that would be quite
a different matter.

137
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:11,754
Brilliant, Adriana.

138
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,511
This is a brilliant idea.

139
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,555
Thank you,
but it wasn't mine.

140
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,555
It is very, very ambitious.

141
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:26,037
But why not?
A big sacrifice.

142
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,832
Only buy what we
absolutely need.

143
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:31,476
A type of Lent,

144
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,594
but this will attest to our faith.

145
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:38,155
And it will humble Calles.

146
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,993
Hello, Jose.

147
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:15,064
It seems Dr. Limón
has lost his watch.

148
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,546
Have you found anything
while you've been sweeping?

149
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:22,827
No, Padre.

150
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,904
Oh.

151
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:27,474
He must have lost it
somewhere else.

152
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:35,665
You're a good sweeper, Jose,

153
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:39,063
but I think you'd be a better altar boy.

154
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:57,985
Well done.

155
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,103
I'm proud of you.

156
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,743
What did I tell you?

157
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,698
You cannot be soft with these people.

158
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,178
They confuse reason with weakness.

159
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:40,862
I showed restraint.

160
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:43,699
What did they do?

161
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:48,260
Become more rebellious,
more insolent.

162
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:54,902
The purpose of this boycott
is very evident.

163
00:14:56,308 --> 00:15:01,257
They want to wreck the economy
and bring our government down.

164
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,737
Congress rejected the petition.

165
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,745
There will be no stopping
the uprisings now.

166
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,180
The boycott is working.

167
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,541
They're afraid, and it's showing.

168
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,299
It's not easy.

169
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:36,580
We have thousands of supporters
all over the country.

170
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:37,574
We can do this.

171
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:41,338
So, I tried.

172
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:43,420
Followed your advice.

173
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,097
Did not work.

174
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:51,095
So now, the next message I send

175
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:54,255
will be unmistakably clear.

176
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:06,812
Alto ya!

177
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:18,611
Vamos!

178
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,051
Ya!

179
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,251
Vamos ya!

180
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,775
Ayúdanos!

181
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,253
Mas duro!

182
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,576
Saquen los niños!

183
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,809
Sangre de Cristo!

184
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,969
No! No! Stop it! No!

185
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,932
Thank God, Adriana.

186
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,688
You're so lucky.

187
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,928
They thought you were dead.

188
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,050
Calles is a monster.

189
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:21,047
I know.

190
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:30,251
We must find another
peaceful solution.

191
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,529
Anacleto, the armed conflict
has already begun.

192
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:39,891
I say we support the rebellion.

193
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:42,570
They'll need food, medicine.

194
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,295
And ammunition.

195
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,973
We can support them

196
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:50,889
with communication and funds...

197
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,292
but we will not fight.

198
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:59,094
I kneel the first time.

199
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:00,608
Ring.

200
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:05,246
Then when I bring the Host up here,

201
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:06,290
ring the bell.

202
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:11,529
And then I go down again.

203
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:12,524
Right?

204
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,008
Finally.

205
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:21,327
He's teaching me to be an altar boy.

206
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,449
You?

207
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:24,445
I thought you were being punished.

208
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:27,449
Hmm.

209
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:42,132
Don Enrique, we have a problem
with milling machine four.

210
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:47,411
Grab those there.

211
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,765
Ay.

212
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:03,925
Beautiful.

213
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,084
Look at this.

214
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,600
Charles Lindbergh
crosses the Atlantic solo.

215
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,128
Me? I am here,

216
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,246
going mad surrounded by pink soap.

217
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,081
You have a beautiful family

218
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,400
and enough memories of battle
to last a lifetime.

219
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:30,803
Memories.

220
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,768
You live in your memories,
you're already dead.

221
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:40,360
I saw you at the church.

222
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:42,041
Are you a gardener now?

223
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,487
Maybe an altar boy.

224
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:46,357
Really?

225
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:49,797
Marilena!

226
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,966
I'll see you later.

227
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,881
The federales are coming!

228
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:31,477
They're coming!

229
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:47,159
Padre, the federal soldiers are coming.

230
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:48,836
You must hide.

231
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:52,678
Hide? I'm too old to hide.

232
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,721
Please, Father, come with me.

233
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,714
You can hide at our house.

234
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,157
Would I hide from God?

235
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,241
This is my home.

236
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:06,758
I'm safe here, Joselito.

237
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:10,995
Jose, who are you

238
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,790
if you don't stand up
for what you believe?

239
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:18,116
There is no greater glory

240
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,920
than to give your life for Christ.

241
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,071
Now...

242
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:32,470
go.

243
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,550
Please, Father.

244
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,951
Go, and run fast.

245
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,548
God bless you.

246
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:16,025
Let this be a lesson

247
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:20,346
to any of you who help
the traitorous Cristeros.

248
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:26,627
Ya!

249
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,305
Ya!

250
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,909
Apunten...

251
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:40,671
ya!

252
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:43,746
Stop.

253
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,547
Fuego!

254
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:08,020
Jose. Mi amor.

255
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,660
Estas bien?

256
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,468
Thank the Lord.

257
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,624
Mi amor.

258
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:44,258
They killed Father Christopher.

259
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,897
I told him he could come here.

260
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:55,016
He wouldn't come with me.

261
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:59,784
I should have made him come with me.

262
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,295
Jose...

263
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:08,337
it was very brave of you to try.

264
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:14,055
Can't Godfather punish them?

265
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,698
Your padrino's a mayor...

266
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:23,780
but even he has no power
over the federales.

267
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,424
Anacleto Gonzalez Flores?

268
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:38,053
Yes?

269
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:13,572
This is the most I could get.

270
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:19,578
Umberto, God bless you.

271
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:28,651
We need to take
five belts each if you can.

272
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:29,980
Let me show you.

273
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:51,015
Hello, Padre.

274
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,656
It is prohibited to say Mass,
Padre Robles.

275
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,331
I forgive you, my son.

276
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:32,965
Ya!

277
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:23,408
Captain.

278
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:45,162
Please. What do you want?

279
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,763
Money?

280
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:48,762
I can get you money.

281
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:50,682
Spend it in hell, cabron.

282
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:20,278
We have over 20,000 men

283
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:23,599
who call themselves
defenders or populists.

284
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:28,319
Most don't even know
of each other's existence.

285
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,888
That's why we need
a commander in chief

286
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:33,686
and a central command.

287
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:37,244
What about your military friends?

288
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:42,083
Well, they suggested
Enrique Gorostieta...

289
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:47,718
an experienced, decorated general
and strategist.

290
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:48,716
He defeated Zapata.

291
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:50,763
I know of him.

292
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,884
I doubt he's sympathetic to our cause.

293
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,400
I don't even think he's Catholic.

294
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,318
We are not hiring him to pray.

295
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:03,037
He is a great man
capable of doing great things.

296
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:06,646
Close your eyes,
and sleep with the angels.

297
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,635
I'll try.

298
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:08,715
Okay.

299
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:13,765
Close your eyes.

300
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:20,834
My mother brought us
that vase from Sevilla.

301
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,074
Sorry, Mother.

302
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:58,395
You looking for me?

303
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,748
He has to be dead.

304
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:24,026
Let's go in.

305
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:26,596
You go first.

306
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,465
Okay?

307
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:33,985
Come on.

308
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:06,587
Come out, cabron.

309
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:08,152
Got you surrounded.

310
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,381
We heard they rode by Chucho's.

311
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,699
We came as fast as we could.

312
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,865
Are you all right?

313
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,346
Who else came to help you?

314
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,625
Go get the rest of the guns

315
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,938
and the ammunition
and their horses.

316
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:19,381
We're Cristeros now, boys!

317
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:29,903
How many?

318
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:31,739
- Six.
- Six.

319
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:33,466
Four here.

320
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,421
Four there.

321
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:36,986
14.

322
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,501
Catorce.

323
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,344
Catorce.

324
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,220
Miguel Gomez Loza.

325
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:47,296
Enrique Gorostieta.

326
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:50,463
Sit down, please.

327
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:59,259
I represent the National League
for the Defence of Religious Liberty.

328
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:02,781
Maybe you have heard us
referred to as the League.

329
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:07,139
I have heard you called
by another name,

330
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,294
Cristeros.

331
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,057
Surely you don't support Calles.

332
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:12,254
No.

333
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:15,459
He's a barbarian

334
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:16,894
and a fool.

335
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:25,297
There are uprisings
all around the country.

336
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:29,022
Over 20,000 men,

337
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:30,582
but no leader.

338
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:33,093
No leader?

339
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:48,014
I am not what you might call
a devout believer.

340
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:49,741
We propose to hire you

341
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:54,293
to turn our armed resistance
into a formidable army.

342
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:56,651
An army?

343
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:02,494
I thank you, sir,
for a most generous offer.

344
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,738
Okay, let's make an army.

345
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:11,380
Let's make a, uh, formidable army

346
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:14,293
out of a group of ragtag peasants
in huaraches...

347
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:18,658
out of a few game ranchers,

348
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:19,730
out of some tender footed clergy

349
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:23,096
who are trembling at the thought
of holding a weapon for the first time.

350
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,735
You want me to make
a national guard out of that?

351
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,529
Look at me.

352
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,213
Do you have proper weapons? No.

353
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,098
Do you have
an ammunition supply? No.

354
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,897
Do you have
a central command? No.

355
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,888
How many is that?

356
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:38,252
Three no's.

357
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:39,658
All you have is belief,

358
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,617
and belief will not save them in battle.

359
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,729
A central command?

360
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:59,537
The League has an extensive
secret network all over Mexico.

361
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:01,654
Weapons, ammunition?

362
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:04,013
From dissenters
within the army itself

363
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,973
and soldiers we have defeated.

364
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:13,926
Surely you have read about
our victories in your paper.

365
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:14,926
And your defeats.

366
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:21,174
General, that's why
we want to hire you.

367
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:24,972
And suppose I'm interested
in your offer.

368
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,091
What are your finances?

369
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,768
You going to pay me in prayers?

370
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:32,571
Tell me what you want,
and I will bring it back to the League.

371
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:35,845
I don't think the Cristeros
can afford me.

372
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:37,652
The question here is,

373
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:43,332
where does the finest general
in Mexico want to serve?

374
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:59,571
If I don't take these photographs,
who will?

375
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:04,724
Who will record this barbarity
that wouldn't be believed?

376
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:07,925
Why didn't they shoot you?

377
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:09,169
Heh.

378
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:13,644
I always promise them a portrait.

379
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:20,721
10 seconds.

380
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:25,321
Miguel.

381
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:31,291
Mijo, what happened?

382
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,805
Are you all right?

383
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:34,290
Yes, Father.

384
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:37,322
There was a big battle.

385
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:40,922
Bullet went right through my ankle.

386
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,325
They killed my horse.

387
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:49,079
Hi.

388
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,325
I will get Dr. Limón.

389
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,399
No, no, no, no.

390
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,128
It's better if no one knows.

391
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,449
No one will know.

392
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,762
I have known him for almost 30 years.

393
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,324
Will he be all right?

394
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:08,887
Yes.

395
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,084
Boys, time to go.

396
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:18,082
Don't tell anyone what you saw here.

397
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:21,205
Viva!

398
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,244
Viva Cristo Rey!

399
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:25,887
Viva El Catorce!

400
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,366
El Catorce!

401
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,360
El Catorce!

402
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,717
El Catorce!

403
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:01,522
There you go, Padre.

404
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:03,083
Thank you, Pablo.

405
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:11,561
The legendary El Catorce.

406
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:13,394
Victoriano Ramirez.

407
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:15,635
My brother Pablo.

408
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:16,634
Hey.

409
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:18,316
They should be here, Pablo.

410
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:19,313
Bring them inside.

411
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:24,517
Where is the general?

412
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:27,322
I'm sorry.
I didn't introduce myself.

413
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,042
General Jose Reyes Vega.

414
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:33,356
You're General Vega?

415
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:34,352
Yes.

416
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:35,716
You're a priest.

417
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:37,042
I'm a priest.

418
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,595
A priest general, huh?

419
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:49,918
Oh. All right.

420
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:51,435
Some water?

421
00:40:51,442 --> 00:40:52,875
Uh, what else do you have?

422
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:55,921
Some tequila. Help yourself.

423
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,913
You know, I-

424
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:02,594
I heard that your last battle
didn't go so well.

425
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:03,875
Now I know why.

426
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,792
Really? Maybe-

427
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,395
Maybe priests shouldn't
be generals. Hmm?

428
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:13,600
Of course, we didn't know
you would be fighting so close.

429
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,910
Did you know that you drove
the federales right into our camp

430
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,433
when we were completely unprepared?

431
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,272
You were completely unprepared?

432
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,316
And this is my fault?

433
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,039
I'm saying we should
be working together.

434
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,837
Under whose command?

435
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,955
The League appointed me
commander.

436
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:37,747
Well, I don't know anything
about any League, Padre.

437
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:40,319
I'm fighting for Cristo Rey
y la Virgen de Guadalupe.

438
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,750
And I'm responsible
for my own men.

439
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,276
Together,
we would be much stronger.

440
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:52,916
We'll stay out of your way.

441
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:54,067
We're going to Autlan.

442
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,308
Jose, women are here
with ammunition.

443
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,229
Bring Adriana in.

444
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:01,192
The what?

445
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:03,233
The women
with the ammunition.

446
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:07,753
Que viva Cristo Rey, Padre.

447
00:42:08,797 --> 00:42:10,071
Que viva.

448
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:11,749
I also brought three nurses.

449
00:42:12,877 --> 00:42:14,434
God bless you, Adriana.

450
00:42:14,436 --> 00:42:15,949
God bless you,
and thank you, ladies.

451
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:19,153
You are as important
to this war as any soldier.

452
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:21,112
- Gracias, Padre.
- Si, Padre.

453
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,151
God bless you.

454
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:26,346
Padre. Excuse me, Padre.

455
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:34,749
You think that's right to involve
the women like this?

456
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:38,384
Our Catholic sisters
are a big part of this war.

457
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:41,114
Without them bringing
ammunition, food,

458
00:42:41,115 --> 00:42:43,151
taking care of the wounded,

459
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:44,951
all would be lost.

460
00:42:44,954 --> 00:42:46,182
Ah.

461
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:49,544
All right.

462
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:54,186
Do you need ammo, guns?

463
00:42:54,194 --> 00:42:55,673
No, no, no.

464
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,983
You keep the ladies'
ammunition, Padre.

465
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:00,666
We've got plenty from
the federales we've killed.

466
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:11,183
What is the occasion?

467
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:14,781
Hmm.

468
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,020
- Salud.
- Salud.

469
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:25,910
An attorney for the League
representing the Cristeros

470
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:27,583
came to see me today.

471
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:32,023
They want to hire me
to command their rebellion.

472
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:34,620
You?

473
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:35,620
Yes.

474
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:40,061
Well, how ironic.

475
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,581
You cannot fight for something
you don't believe in.

476
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,750
I may have issues with the Church,

477
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:49,741
but I believe in religious freedom.

478
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,584
And I believe in you.

479
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,262
And if I'm successful,

480
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,783
the church bells will ring freely again,

481
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:01,862
and our girls,
they can continue their catechism.

482
00:44:04,149 --> 00:44:05,821
You are really considering this?

483
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:06,818
Yes.

484
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:26,380
Tulita, I have asked them
for 3,000 pesos a month.

485
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,537
That's twice what
the federal generals make.

486
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,539
Plus 50,000 in insurance
for you and the girls.

487
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:35,220
They've agreed to everything.

488
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:40,586
50,000 if you die.

489
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:41,621
I'm not going to die.

490
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:42,979
So you have it all figured out?

491
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:45,454
And where do I and the girls fit in this?

492
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:02,661
Tulita, listen to me.

493
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:05,784
I'm dying here.

494
00:45:05,785 --> 00:45:08,379
I'm a military man.

495
00:45:08,385 --> 00:45:10,693
You knew that when you married me.

496
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:13,502
You a Cristero?

497
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,016
You are an atheist.

498
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,096
Are you awake?

499
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,422
Yes.

500
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:39,337
You were right.

501
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:42,334
It would be hypocritical.

502
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:46,179
I'm going to turn 'em down.

503
00:45:48,982 --> 00:45:52,338
You may have nothing you believe in, but I do.

504
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:58,773
I believe in what you
would be fighting for.

505
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:09,129
Maybe by doing it, you will, too.

506
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,175
Just come back to me, General...

507
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,969
to us...

508
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,331
to the loving man I married.

509
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:32,848
I promise.

510
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:48,773
The American secretary of State-

511
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:50,291
Como se llama el gringo ese?

512
00:46:50,298 --> 00:46:51,287
Mr. Kellogg.

513
00:46:51,298 --> 00:46:52,447
Kellogg...

514
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:56,894
is making the outrageous remark

515
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,448
that Bolshevik forces
are at work in Mexico

516
00:47:01,457 --> 00:47:04,972
and stating
that we have to guarantee

517
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:09,811
the life and property
of every U.S. citizen in Mexico.

518
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:12,732
What does he think I am?

519
00:47:12,736 --> 00:47:15,694
Mexico will not tolerate
foreign governments

520
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:18,813
meddling in our internal affairs.

521
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,010
Thank you for coming.

522
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:21,085
Not at all.

523
00:47:21,096 --> 00:47:22,813
Dwight, do you speak any Spanish?

524
00:47:22,815 --> 00:47:24,692
Just a little.

525
00:47:24,695 --> 00:47:25,844
Look, I'll be blunt.

526
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:29,973
Our ambassador to Mexico
has botched things, badly.

527
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:31,613
You revamped the aviation policy.

528
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,287
You've been General Pershing's
right-hand man.

529
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,286
I think you can handle
ambassador to Mexico.

530
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:37,047
Cal. Cal, my dear friend,
I'm honored.

531
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,372
Don't answer now.

532
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:41,853
Think about it.

533
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:43,526
Talk it over with Elizabeth.

534
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,092
What's the real story?

535
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:52,324
President Calles is repealing
the Bucareli Agreements.

536
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,801
50 years, and our oil concessions
are finished.

537
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,248
And what would you like me
to do, Mr. President?

538
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:00,811
What you always do.

539
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:04,001
Fix it.

540
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:07,521
Let's be frank.

541
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:09,284
You called them Bolsheviks.

542
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:12,728
I was simply
calling a spade a spade.

543
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:17,441
Would you have us just roll over
and let them steal our oil fields?

544
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,768
And just how do you
think offending them

545
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,409
is going to help our cause?

546
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,642
President Coolidge
wants a diplomatic approach.

547
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:27,970
I'm convinced he's right.

548
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,927
Half of Europe just became
the Soviet Union.

549
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,525
We need Mexico
in more ways than one.

550
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:39,206
Well, I warn you from experience
that there's no negotiating with Calles.

551
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,962
Thank you for your assessment
and your advice,

552
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,325
but I am the current
ambassador to Mexico.

553
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,639
The results of your tenure
speak for themselves.

554
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:52,160
Now, why am I getting all this pressure
from the Knights of Columbus

555
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:54,888
about this conflict between Calles
and the Church?

556
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:56,117
Conflict?

557
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:57,448
Oh, that's nothing.

558
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:45,995
We're Cristeros, and we're taking
the gold off this train.

559
00:49:47,006 --> 00:49:48,883
Viva Cristo Rey.

560
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:50,443
You see?

561
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:52,794
Que viva.

562
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:56,161
It's all right. Stand aside.

563
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:03,595
That's it.

564
00:50:03,605 --> 00:50:04,593
Excellent, Pablo.

565
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:29,840
We are only after the gold.

566
00:50:29,843 --> 00:50:31,834
We are Cristeros.

567
00:50:32,603 --> 00:50:34,240
Don't be afraid.

568
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:52,360
Get the passengers off the train.

569
00:50:55,801 --> 00:50:57,314
You did it, Pablito.

570
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,595
Well done!

571
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,514
Pablo! Pablo!

572
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,829
Pablo.

573
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,993
Pablo. No, no. Pablo.

574
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:20,398
Aca.

575
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:23,988
Francisco.

576
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:26,308
Francisco!

577
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,873
Take the dynamite.
Blow the safe.

578
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:32,989
Clear the people from this area!

579
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:34,670
Andalé! Forma fila!

580
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:37,033
Muévase! Muévase!

581
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:39,393
Clear this area!
We're blowing the safe!

582
00:51:40,718 --> 00:51:42,549
Camine! Camine!

583
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:43,547
Come on.

584
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:46,027
Vamonos!

585
00:51:47,597 --> 00:51:49,315
It's lit, sir.

586
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:50,796
Muevete! Muevete!

587
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:10,674
Are all the passengers out?

588
00:52:11,676 --> 00:52:13,268
Are all the passengers out?

589
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:14,595
Yes, sir, they are.

590
00:52:17,955 --> 00:52:19,786
Then what are you waiting for?

591
00:52:19,795 --> 00:52:22,150
Set fire to this train!

592
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:23,144
Andalé! Apurate!

593
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:24,986
Hágale! Hágale!

594
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:27,589
We got it, all of it.

595
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:44,987
Fuego!

596
00:52:55,553 --> 00:52:58,306
These so-called Cristeros

597
00:52:58,313 --> 00:53:01,702
burned hundreds
of innocent people alive.

598
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:04,272
The Mexican government has proof

599
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:08,504
that the Roman Catholic Episcopate
ordered this atrocity.

600
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:12,903
Bishops have agreed
to leave the country,

601
00:53:12,912 --> 00:53:16,620
avoiding responsibility,
and abandon Mexico.

602
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:23,104
General, everything's ready.

603
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:26,342
You can communicate to troops
in any area through us.

604
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:30,628
Our best undercover operative
will accompany you.

605
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,949
This is for you.

606
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,143
And viva Cristo Rey.

607
00:53:55,669 --> 00:53:59,456
Caballeros,
General Enrique Gorostieta.

608
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:26,898
And what's this catrin you hire

609
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:29,659
like you hire a whore
going to do for us?

610
00:54:32,706 --> 00:54:34,264
Who is this ranch hand

611
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:36,780
who has already decided
that his military strategy

612
00:54:36,786 --> 00:54:39,300
is better than that
of a twice-decorated general

613
00:54:39,306 --> 00:54:40,659
who fought with Huerta?

614
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,941
Why should we trust you?

615
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:46,340
Because I know
how to lead an army.

616
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:54,093
This is not about killing 14,
Victoriano Ramirez.

617
00:54:54,105 --> 00:54:58,461
It's about winning the war,
and war is chess.

618
00:54:58,464 --> 00:54:59,453
Teniente.

619
00:55:01,904 --> 00:55:04,338
I've been following this war very closely.

620
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:07,461
The federales, they control the trains

621
00:55:07,464 --> 00:55:09,819
and the towns the trains go through.

622
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:14,613
The outlying towns
and villages will be ours.

623
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:18,423
There will be no reason to fight

624
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:22,132
lined up in front of each other
like ancient knights.

625
00:55:22,143 --> 00:55:25,215
We will fight with lightning
attacks from the wings,

626
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:27,690
and before they know
what happened to them,

627
00:55:27,702 --> 00:55:29,579
the Cristeros will be gone.

628
00:55:31,422 --> 00:55:33,174
We will not attack from one side,

629
00:55:33,182 --> 00:55:34,661
but from two and sometimes three,

630
00:55:34,662 --> 00:55:36,220
like a jimador and his machete.

631
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:39,377
Understood?

632
00:55:40,822 --> 00:55:43,619
How many armed men
and cavalry do we have?

633
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,099
General Vega.

634
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:48,170
I know who you are.

635
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:51,412
I have 4,000 men and 100 cavalry.

636
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:52,410
Good.

637
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:54,298
General Pedroza.

638
00:55:54,301 --> 00:55:56,973
I have 2,000 at your service,
comandante.

639
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,893
I have 700 armed rancheros
on horseback,

640
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,289
and I will command my own men.

641
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,018
And you will take orders from me.

642
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,897
Like hell, I will.

643
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,458
Then why are you here?

644
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,098
I don't know.

645
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,891
Well, I do.

646
00:56:12,899 --> 00:56:14,571
You wanted to meet me.

647
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,535
You knew that we needed
a central command,

648
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,212
and you wanted to see
what kind of man I was.

649
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:22,011
So I will tell you,

650
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:23,213
and I will tell you all.

651
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:26,449
I am a veteran of two wars,

652
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:30,133
and I was promoted to general
when I was very young...

653
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:33,057
for a specific reason,

654
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:34,730
because I have a gift.

655
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:38,208
Yes, I have a gift-
for military strategy.

656
00:56:38,218 --> 00:56:40,448
And he's humble, too.

657
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:47,170
I am now the commander
of this army.

658
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:50,214
If you don't show respect,
you can go.

659
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:53,015
Now.

660
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:54,245
Go.

661
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:56,611
Go to the hills,
and continue to fight.

662
00:56:56,616 --> 00:56:59,733
Raid villages until you
are shot or hanged.

663
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,610
Go.

664
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:12,009
So you stay.

665
00:57:14,175 --> 00:57:15,210
Good.

666
00:57:17,135 --> 00:57:18,693
General Vega.

667
00:57:18,695 --> 00:57:21,892
The entire world has heard
about the priest

668
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:23,567
who burned people alive.

669
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:26,293
You gave Calles exactly
what he needed,

670
00:57:26,294 --> 00:57:28,012
a way to demonize us,

671
00:57:28,014 --> 00:57:33,088
so now public support for our cause
has been severely compromised.

672
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,604
Those are more of Calles' lies.

673
00:57:36,614 --> 00:57:37,933
Lies?

674
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:44,690
They have raped and killed women
in front of their children,

675
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:47,048
marched them for days and days,

676
00:57:47,053 --> 00:57:50,284
left them to die in corrals
like diseased cattle.

677
00:57:50,293 --> 00:57:51,612
They have taken priests-

678
00:57:51,613 --> 00:57:53,012
So you're here for revenge?

679
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:54,127
Is that it, Padre?

680
00:57:57,372 --> 00:57:58,851
Is that why you're here?

681
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:02,845
Because if you are,
you can go home

682
00:58:02,852 --> 00:58:05,047
and pray to God
that He may forgive you.

683
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:09,127
Because we are now an army.

684
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:14,000
We are an army fighting for God
and for the Church...

685
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:16,844
and for absolute freedom.

686
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:21,287
We must work together,

687
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,280
me and you.

688
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,881
We might die together,

689
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:29,485
me and you.

690
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,805
But we will fight with honor...

691
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:42,323
and dignity...

692
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:47,648
and with cunning...

693
00:58:49,249 --> 00:58:51,240
and by the grace of God...

694
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:53,687
we will be victorious.

695
00:58:57,128 --> 00:58:58,447
Viva Cristo Rey.

696
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:31,115
God bless you, Father.

697
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:36,403
Now all the devils burning in hell

698
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,077
will enjoy your art.

699
00:59:40,445 --> 00:59:41,639
Stop!

700
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:43,954
- Please, sir, stop!
- Stop what?

701
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:45,717
Mayor Picazo is my padrino.

702
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:48,876
Mayor Picazo knows we are here.

703
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,238
Please, sir, I'm begging you.

704
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:52,917
Get out of here.

705
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:58,674
Get out of here!

706
01:00:11,043 --> 01:00:14,433
Padrino! They have Miguel.

707
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:16,035
They're going to kill him.

708
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,152
I know.

709
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,397
I know, Jose.

710
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,677
I know, uh-
I know all about him.

711
01:00:23,682 --> 01:00:25,673
He is a well-known Cristero.

712
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:27,593
He killed a federal sergeant.

713
01:00:27,602 --> 01:00:30,116
They've been waiting for him
to come back

714
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,033
to that subversive father of his.

715
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,714
But his father never did anything.

716
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,792
Don't think I don't know
where you were last night.

717
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:52,038
And I saved your life this time, Jose,

718
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,474
but I'm warning you.

719
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,674
These are dark times.

720
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,830
I won't be able to do it again.

721
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,518
Now get out.

722
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:22,429
We're going to join the Cristeros.

723
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:26,034
Cristeros.

724
01:01:27,638 --> 01:01:29,230
How?

725
01:01:29,238 --> 01:01:31,274
They'll say we're too young.

726
01:01:31,278 --> 01:01:32,631
They won't take us.

727
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:36,835
Not if we tell them
they will kill us here.

728
01:01:41,877 --> 01:01:42,992
Come on, Lalo.

729
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:45,872
You and me,

730
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,426
together.

731
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,261
Not ours.

732
01:02:57,272 --> 01:02:59,308
Where did you find it, son?

733
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:00,461
There.

734
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:04,346
Someone's smuggling ammunition.

735
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,750
- Check the station.
- Open your bag.

736
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:14,580
What's going on?

737
01:04:14,587 --> 01:04:18,704
They've raided and closed
every one of the League offices.

738
01:04:18,706 --> 01:04:20,822
Many have been arrested,

739
01:04:20,826 --> 01:04:24,455
and God knows how many
have been tortured or killed by now.

740
01:04:26,706 --> 01:04:27,980
We need your help.

741
01:04:31,505 --> 01:04:32,824
I can't help you.

742
01:04:34,425 --> 01:04:37,861
The more and more I think,
Anacleto was right.

743
01:04:37,865 --> 01:04:40,220
All this violence
has gotten us nowhere.

744
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,903
I understand.

745
01:04:49,424 --> 01:04:52,177
But I need you to take
this to Gorostieta.

746
01:04:58,704 --> 01:04:59,819
No, Miguel.

747
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:04,093
Adriana, this is critical,

748
01:05:04,103 --> 01:05:07,618
contact information
for all our principal members.

749
01:05:07,623 --> 01:05:10,535
Without this, there will be
no central command.

750
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,251
You would go without saying goodbye?

751
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:05,771
I can't stay here, Mother.

752
01:06:07,419 --> 01:06:10,889
Not while my friends and brothers
are joining the Cristeros.

753
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:15,250
I need to fight.

754
01:06:23,098 --> 01:06:25,248
Que Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe...

755
01:06:26,938 --> 01:06:28,450
te bendiga, mi amor.

756
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,574
May she watch over...

757
01:06:35,457 --> 01:06:37,254
and protect you.

758
01:06:38,897 --> 01:06:40,853
T ell Papa I love him.

759
01:06:40,857 --> 01:06:42,529
You will need a horse.

760
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,245
Are you ready?

761
01:06:59,855 --> 01:07:00,924
Let's go.

762
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:41,607
Calles' revenge.

763
01:07:41,612 --> 01:07:44,001
Revenge for what I did.

764
01:07:44,012 --> 01:07:46,003
Yes! Revenge for what you did!

765
01:07:54,252 --> 01:07:55,287
Teniente.

766
01:07:55,292 --> 01:07:56,360
General.

767
01:07:56,371 --> 01:07:58,839
These Christians must be buried.

768
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:01,524
Today we will become
an army of gravediggers.

769
01:09:13,646 --> 01:09:15,716
You think it suits me?

770
01:09:15,726 --> 01:09:17,079
Well...

771
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,361
anything that covers that face of yours.

772
01:09:22,406 --> 01:09:23,475
- Mm.
- Gracias, señora.

773
01:09:23,486 --> 01:09:24,600
De nada. De nada.

774
01:09:26,045 --> 01:09:29,594
Oh, it must be Señora Hernandez
needing her medicine.

775
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:30,594
We are eating.

776
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:33,517
People count on us, Jorge.

777
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:38,515
Just a minute.

778
01:09:43,924 --> 01:09:45,880
Good evening.

779
01:09:45,884 --> 01:09:49,115
I need some medicine for my son.
Can you please help me?

780
01:09:49,124 --> 01:09:50,603
Of course, dear boy.

781
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,834
Uh, give me one second,
and I'll get the keys.

782
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:53,832
Thank you.

783
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:00,677
The police are here.

784
01:10:00,683 --> 01:10:02,560
Let's go. Quickly.

785
01:10:02,563 --> 01:10:03,962
I'll handle the door.

786
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:07,872
To the passageway.

787
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:09,520
- No, Anacleto. No.
- Hey, hey, hey.

788
01:10:09,522 --> 01:10:10,591
I'll be right behind you.

789
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:12,479
- No, Anacleto.
- Go.

790
01:10:12,482 --> 01:10:14,074
Go! Go! Go!

791
01:10:22,002 --> 01:10:24,515
It's very late. Can you please
come back in the morning?

792
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:25,510
I'm sorry?

793
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,030
Open the door.

794
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:38,150
Anacleto Gonzalez Flores?

795
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,991
Or is it Don Jose?

796
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,433
I am Anacleto.

797
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:05,875
We know exactly what
peaceful work you're doing.

798
01:11:07,238 --> 01:11:10,469
We hope your friends learn
from your mistakes.

799
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:15,955
May God bless
and forgive you, sir.

800
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:19,836
I do.

801
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:55,744
Jose?

802
01:11:55,755 --> 01:11:56,790
Yes?

803
01:11:56,795 --> 01:11:58,786
Do you ever wonder about God?

804
01:12:00,995 --> 01:12:02,269
Yes.

805
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:07,953
I'm scared.

806
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:10,709
Me, too.

807
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:16,269
But Jesus is watching over us, Lalo.

808
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,706
Since when did you become a priest?

809
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:23,547
I'm no priest.

810
01:12:24,593 --> 01:12:26,072
But I believe it.

811
01:12:29,073 --> 01:12:32,111
I know it.

812
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,629
Good night, Jose.

813
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,145
Good night.

814
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:56,507
Quien vive?

815
01:12:58,311 --> 01:13:00,222
Viva Cristo Rey.

816
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:02,021
Get down.

817
01:13:27,509 --> 01:13:28,658
Stomach!

818
01:13:29,629 --> 01:13:30,744
Down!

819
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:33,187
Hold the positions.

820
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:45,940
We want to see the general, sir.

821
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:51,895
He's too busy to talk to you.

822
01:13:51,907 --> 01:13:53,056
Turn around and go home.

823
01:13:54,507 --> 01:13:56,737
We won't leave until we
talk to the general.

824
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:00,666
Go home, now!

825
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:01,656
Teniente!

826
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:02,941
Who wants to talk to me?

827
01:14:03,746 --> 01:14:04,815
These boys, sir.

828
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:08,217
Go. Now.

829
01:14:09,826 --> 01:14:10,895
Go. Let's go!

830
01:14:10,906 --> 01:14:11,895
Rapido!

831
01:14:16,946 --> 01:14:18,378
Why are you here?

832
01:14:18,385 --> 01:14:20,296
We want to be Cristeros, mi General.

833
01:14:20,305 --> 01:14:22,660
And why do you want to be Cristeros?

834
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:25,623
The padre of the church of Sahuayo...

835
01:14:27,145 --> 01:14:28,180
was killed...

836
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:31,258
in front of me.

837
01:14:35,984 --> 01:14:38,782
He was teaching me to be an altar boy.

838
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:49,338
Marta! Get these young men
something to eat!

839
01:14:49,343 --> 01:14:50,776
Si, mi General.

840
01:14:50,783 --> 01:14:52,102
Go.

841
01:14:53,383 --> 01:14:54,452
Gracias, mi General.

842
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:04,854
You must be hungry.

843
01:15:04,862 --> 01:15:06,215
Come on.

844
01:15:09,782 --> 01:15:10,931
Get up!

845
01:15:10,942 --> 01:15:13,331
War is no place for bums.

846
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,089
Enjoy.

847
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,780
General, can you teach me to shoot?

848
01:15:44,815 --> 01:15:47,339
It would not be right in the eyes of God
to make you soldiers.

849
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:49,808
We can fight.

850
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:54,334
Yes, I know you could fight,

851
01:15:54,339 --> 01:15:56,330
but it'd be better for you
to serve the cause

852
01:15:56,339 --> 01:15:57,977
by helping out around the camp.

853
01:15:59,299 --> 01:16:00,856
What I need is for you to show me

854
01:16:00,858 --> 01:16:03,577
that you're good workers
and that you're disciplined.

855
01:16:10,978 --> 01:16:12,047
Like this?

856
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,329
May the body
of Our Lord Jesus Christ

857
01:16:37,336 --> 01:16:39,292
preserve your soul
unto everlasting life.

858
01:16:40,456 --> 01:16:42,253
May the body
of Our Lord Jesus Christ

859
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:43,655
preserve your soul
unto everlasting life.

860
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,367
May the body
of Our Lord Jesus Christ

861
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,206
preserve your soul
unto everlasting life.

862
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:50,125
Amen.

863
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,808
You need to confess first.

864
01:16:58,855 --> 01:17:00,970
Wouldn't He already know?

865
01:17:03,334 --> 01:17:04,323
You should confess.

866
01:17:05,574 --> 01:17:07,212
May the body
of Our Lord Jesus Christ

867
01:17:07,214 --> 01:17:09,853
preserve your soul
unto everlasting life.

868
01:17:32,532 --> 01:17:34,841
Un honor conocerlo.

869
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:36,763
Good to have you here.

870
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:37,761
Thank you.

871
01:17:38,892 --> 01:17:39,881
Mmm.

872
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:41,405
You like Mexican food?

873
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:44,403
Well, don't get much of it
in New Jersey,

874
01:17:44,411 --> 01:17:47,084
but this, just delicious.

875
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:49,844
It's called mole poblano.

876
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:51,284
It's made with chocolate.

877
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,168
Chocolate. Hmm.

878
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:56,959
One of Mexico's pre-Colombian
gifts to the world.

879
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:00,486
Oh, this is magnificent.

880
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,081
Thank you. What are
your impressions of Mexico?

881
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:08,319
Well, I've traveled in Mexico
numerous times,

882
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:10,286
and, uh, you know,
I'm always charmed.

883
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,286
And it's-it's interesting,

884
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:16,486
invariably I discover something
that connects our two countries,

885
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:20,084
chocolate and petroleum
being two of them.

886
01:18:20,089 --> 01:18:23,399
American oil companies have been
granted a 50-year concession

887
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:26,242
that I consider very generous.

888
01:18:26,249 --> 01:18:27,567
Please sit.

889
01:18:29,048 --> 01:18:31,278
Well, I understand there are some
in Washington

890
01:18:31,288 --> 01:18:34,405
who don't see it that way.

891
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:39,158
We've been following your war
with the Catholic Church.

892
01:18:39,168 --> 01:18:40,920
I would hardly call it a war.

893
01:18:40,928 --> 01:18:42,724
Terrible, what happened on the train.

894
01:18:42,727 --> 01:18:44,524
They were led by a priest.

895
01:18:44,527 --> 01:18:47,360
What does that tell you about
their so-called moral superiority?

896
01:18:47,367 --> 01:18:50,165
51 people burned alive.

897
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:51,236
Barbaric.

898
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:56,045
But surely that doesn't represent
the entire Catholic population.

899
01:18:57,446 --> 01:19:02,395
In my experience, it's small groups
of extremists that start wars.

900
01:19:02,886 --> 01:19:05,241
In my experience as a revolutionary,

901
01:19:05,246 --> 01:19:09,558
a small group of determined men
can bring down a government,

902
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:13,763
and that is why every Catholic aggression
must be responded to immediately,

903
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:16,484
forcefully, and without hesitation.

904
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:22,163
And if we continue talking politics,
we're going to ruin our digestions.

905
01:19:23,245 --> 01:19:26,123
Ambassador, salud.

906
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,113
Salud.

907
01:19:27,124 --> 01:19:28,443
Bienvenido a Mexico.

908
01:19:36,804 --> 01:19:38,078
Hey!

909
01:19:40,204 --> 01:19:42,842
- Victoriano.
- Eh?

910
01:19:43,603 --> 01:19:44,752
Don't go through the canyon
to Tlaquepaque.

911
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:45,752
It's a trap.

912
01:19:47,403 --> 01:19:48,802
How do you know that?

913
01:19:49,523 --> 01:19:51,081
My scout was there yesterday.

914
01:19:52,043 --> 01:19:54,113
Let's just say it's a gut feeling.

915
01:19:55,443 --> 01:19:57,398
An ambush is what
I would do if I was them.

916
01:20:03,282 --> 01:20:06,035
Let me ask you something, General.

917
01:20:08,282 --> 01:20:09,681
I'm just curious.

918
01:20:11,241 --> 01:20:14,995
If we die, if you lose this war-

919
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:16,992
We're not going to lose this war.

920
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:21,032
If you lose this war,

921
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:23,350
do you still get paid all the money?

922
01:20:24,881 --> 01:20:26,711
Or do you get, like, half?

923
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,594
I'm just curious.

924
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,953
You want something from me, Flaco?

925
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:45,478
If we die, we all die,

926
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:48,118
but my family will be taken care of.

927
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:50,158
That's very good for your family.

928
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:56,150
We'll go through the canyon.

929
01:20:56,998 --> 01:20:58,750
Of course you will.

930
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:03,836
Go with God, then.

931
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:12,835
Hyah! Hyah!

932
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:33,634
Mi General,

933
01:21:33,636 --> 01:21:36,833
why did you let him
disrespect you that way?

934
01:22:20,873 --> 01:22:22,226
Up in the rocks!

935
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:23,631
They're up in the rocks!

936
01:22:25,512 --> 01:22:26,945
Take cover!

937
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,940
Que viva Cristo Rey!

938
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,065
Wait here!

939
01:23:37,067 --> 01:23:38,785
Viva Cristo Rey.

940
01:23:40,027 --> 01:23:41,380
Que viva.

941
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:44,696
Hyah.

942
01:23:50,107 --> 01:23:51,505
Muevanse, muchachos.

943
01:23:55,066 --> 01:23:56,021
Jose!

944
01:23:56,666 --> 01:23:57,815
Mi General.

945
01:23:59,906 --> 01:24:02,101
Chamaco's very happy to see you.

946
01:24:02,106 --> 01:24:03,141
He's very tired.

947
01:24:06,945 --> 01:24:09,664
I heard you saved Victoriano

948
01:24:09,665 --> 01:24:11,940
even though he said those things.

949
01:24:13,945 --> 01:24:16,778
A man like Victoriano,
respect is won.

950
01:24:19,905 --> 01:24:21,895
Look at him. Come here.

951
01:24:21,904 --> 01:24:23,576
Look how beautiful he is.

952
01:24:24,424 --> 01:24:26,096
He's a Friesan.

953
01:24:27,184 --> 01:24:30,176
His name means "little child. "

954
01:24:30,184 --> 01:24:33,301
He's a legendary war horse
from northern Europe.

955
01:24:33,304 --> 01:24:37,262
In the Middle Ages, he would carry
armored knights and kings into battle.

956
01:24:37,263 --> 01:24:40,699
His owner gave him to us
specifically for our cause.

957
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:43,695
He's the only one
of its kind in all of Mexico.

958
01:24:47,223 --> 01:24:48,212
Go.

959
01:24:50,222 --> 01:24:51,416
Say hello.

960
01:25:01,782 --> 01:25:03,420
What's it like to ride him?

961
01:25:04,022 --> 01:25:05,340
You tell me.

962
01:25:05,341 --> 01:25:07,616
He'll need to be exercised
tomorrow morning.

963
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:13,012
But you have to be gentle on the reins.
He has a very sensitive mouth.

964
01:25:13,021 --> 01:25:14,420
And he's very fast.

965
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:17,538
He loves to run,
so you have to hold on tight.

966
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:20,373
Hey, Chamaco.

967
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,336
Bello Chamaco.

968
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,730
But what's it like to ride him?

969
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,379
It's like being close to heaven.

970
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:38,768
Jose.

971
01:25:40,939 --> 01:25:44,648
I've never had a son, but if I did,
I would want him to be just like you.

972
01:25:45,699 --> 01:25:47,018
Que viva Cristo Rey.

973
01:25:48,019 --> 01:25:49,053
Que viva!

974
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:55,132
Bueno.

975
01:25:55,138 --> 01:25:57,527
...meijor fortificacion.

976
01:25:57,538 --> 01:25:59,847
Pero cuanta gente
tenemos en esta area?

977
01:25:59,858 --> 01:26:02,849
Aqui en esta area, tenemos
unas dos mil tropas-

978
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:03,926
Senor Presidente.

979
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:08,569
Mi General Ortiz
and almost 500 men are dead.

980
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:09,896
Ortiz?

981
01:26:09,897 --> 01:26:11,330
That's impossible.

982
01:26:11,337 --> 01:26:12,895
Who told you that?

983
01:26:12,897 --> 01:26:14,535
A counterambush, sir.

984
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:16,414
Cristeros hired Enrique Gorostieta

985
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,771
as commander
of all the Cristero forces.

986
01:26:24,696 --> 01:26:27,085
General Gorostieta is behind this?

987
01:26:27,096 --> 01:26:28,768
He fought with Huerta, sir.

988
01:26:28,776 --> 01:26:29,765
I know.

989
01:26:29,776 --> 01:26:31,573
I know that.

990
01:26:31,576 --> 01:26:33,406
What I don't know

991
01:26:33,415 --> 01:26:38,091
is how could someone like Ortiz
be so incompetent?

992
01:26:41,255 --> 01:26:43,849
Gorostieta.

993
01:26:43,855 --> 01:26:48,609
His treason will not be
forgotten nor forgiven.

994
01:26:48,614 --> 01:26:49,808
Do you understand?

995
01:26:51,494 --> 01:26:53,371
Go to Los Altos immediately.

996
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,285
Bring all the men you can.

997
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:56,409
Yes, Mr. President.

998
01:26:56,414 --> 01:26:57,403
Go.

999
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:00,208
Go!

1000
01:27:08,813 --> 01:27:10,724
Gorostieta is back in politics?

1001
01:27:10,733 --> 01:27:11,722
Yes, sir.

1002
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,209
But I know him.

1003
01:27:14,213 --> 01:27:15,726
His heart is not in this.

1004
01:27:21,132 --> 01:27:23,521
Find out what he really wants.

1005
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:25,481
What he-

1006
01:27:25,492 --> 01:27:28,211
Porfirio Diaz used to say,

1007
01:27:28,212 --> 01:27:31,123
"A dog with a bone in his mouth

1008
01:27:31,131 --> 01:27:33,691
doesn't bark and doesn't bite. "

1009
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:38,043
In politics, everything has a price.

1010
01:27:39,691 --> 01:27:40,680
Go find his.

1011
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:58,240
How was the ride?

1012
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:03,481
Like flying, sir.

1013
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:06,399
Come here.

1014
01:28:16,048 --> 01:28:18,004
Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to lead the men into battle.

1015
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,002
Want to carry the flag?

1016
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,527
It would be an honor, sir.

1017
01:28:26,888 --> 01:28:28,879
We leave at first light.

1018
01:29:09,965 --> 01:29:12,274
Today we are going to
send a message.

1019
01:29:12,285 --> 01:29:15,037
We are going to send a message to Calles

1020
01:29:15,044 --> 01:29:17,353
and to the rest of the world...

1021
01:29:19,884 --> 01:29:22,478
that freedom is not just for writers

1022
01:29:22,484 --> 01:29:26,762
and for politicians and-
and for fancy documents!

1023
01:29:26,764 --> 01:29:28,594
Freedom-

1024
01:29:28,603 --> 01:29:30,275
Freedom is our home,

1025
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:33,161
our wives, our children, our faith.

1026
01:29:34,003 --> 01:29:36,039
Freedom is our lives...

1027
01:29:38,283 --> 01:29:41,002
and we will defend it or die trying!

1028
01:29:42,163 --> 01:29:44,676
It is not only our duty to defend it,

1029
01:29:44,682 --> 01:29:46,240
but it is our right!

1030
01:29:50,482 --> 01:29:56,079
You must remember that men
will fire bullets,

1031
01:29:56,082 --> 01:29:58,754
but God decides where they land!

1032
01:30:00,881 --> 01:30:02,439
Que viva Cristo Rey!

1033
01:30:02,441 --> 01:30:04,033
Que viva!

1034
01:30:04,041 --> 01:30:07,351
- Que viva Cristo Rey!
- Que viva!

1035
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:08,953
- Que viva!
- Que viva!

1036
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,314
My dearest Tulita...

1037
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,674
today was a magnificent day,

1038
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,352
and not simply because
we routed the federales

1039
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:32,031
in our greatest victory yet.

1040
01:30:33,319 --> 01:30:36,675
There is a change
in the spirit of my men,

1041
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:39,318
a transformation
I can see in their eyes.

1042
01:30:40,799 --> 01:30:43,392
They finally believe
we can win this war.

1043
01:30:44,798 --> 01:30:47,471
I know the federales
can sense this, too.

1044
01:30:48,838 --> 01:30:51,875
The scent of fear now blows
from their camps.

1045
01:30:53,038 --> 01:30:55,632
We must strike them harder now,

1046
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:58,310
push them back

1047
01:30:58,317 --> 01:31:03,107
so the people will be emboldened
to support us in the cities.

1048
01:31:03,117 --> 01:31:06,427
Then Calles and his army
will have nowhere to hide.

1049
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:11,271
My strategy cannot fail us,

1050
01:31:12,196 --> 01:31:15,268
and I will be home before long.

1051
01:31:16,796 --> 01:31:19,435
Keep me close in your heart, my love,

1052
01:31:19,436 --> 01:31:23,952
and I will see you again tonight
in my dreams.

1053
01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:29,388
This-This war

1054
01:31:29,395 --> 01:31:33,468
has Americans and other foreigners
reluctant to do business

1055
01:31:33,475 --> 01:31:34,749
or even visit,

1056
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,473
and I wonder if...

1057
01:31:37,595 --> 01:31:40,904
you can see your way
to some kind of compromise.

1058
01:31:40,914 --> 01:31:41,903
No.

1059
01:31:43,074 --> 01:31:49,422
But if your country and my country
would strengthen their ties...

1060
01:31:51,474 --> 01:31:53,783
this could end very quickly.

1061
01:31:57,233 --> 01:31:59,747
That's not what I had in mind.

1062
01:31:59,753 --> 01:32:02,586
Actual military support is-
of course, is out of the question,

1063
01:32:02,593 --> 01:32:04,868
but I think a provision could be made

1064
01:32:04,873 --> 01:32:09,788
for the sale of American
machine guns and aircraft.

1065
01:32:09,793 --> 01:32:11,384
When can I get the planes?

1066
01:32:16,392 --> 01:32:17,666
Well, Mr. President,

1067
01:32:17,672 --> 01:32:19,902
first we need the gesture of goodwill.

1068
01:32:21,552 --> 01:32:23,270
Now, I think a different position

1069
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:25,910
on American petroleum interests
would go a long way.

1070
01:32:32,151 --> 01:32:35,063
I will bring your generous offer
to Congress.

1071
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:56,620
Forward!

1072
01:33:45,906 --> 01:33:49,023
Mi General, here's my horse.

1073
01:33:59,905 --> 01:34:01,179
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

1074
01:34:01,185 --> 01:34:02,413
Come here. Come on.
Get on the horse.

1075
01:34:02,425 --> 01:34:04,017
You'll be faster alone, mi General.

1076
01:34:04,025 --> 01:34:05,936
What are you doing?
Get on the horse.

1077
01:34:05,945 --> 01:34:07,741
Sorry, mi General.

1078
01:34:07,744 --> 01:34:08,859
Get on the hor-

1079
01:34:08,864 --> 01:34:10,661
Jose!
They're going to kill you!

1080
01:34:10,664 --> 01:34:11,699
Get on the horse!

1081
01:34:11,704 --> 01:34:12,978
I'll be fine, mi General.

1082
01:34:16,864 --> 01:34:18,217
Stay low, Jose!

1083
01:34:18,224 --> 01:34:19,543
I'll come back for you!

1084
01:34:25,503 --> 01:34:27,698
- Take cover!
- Do it!

1085
01:34:30,543 --> 01:34:31,532
Viva Cristo Rey.

1086
01:34:37,462 --> 01:34:38,451
Que viva.

1087
01:34:44,942 --> 01:34:46,216
Jose!

1088
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,858
You took his horse?

1089
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,780
You took a boy's horse?

1090
01:35:14,815 --> 01:35:17,977
He refused to get on.
It was either him or me.

1091
01:35:31,779 --> 01:35:32,768
Is he dead?

1092
01:35:35,738 --> 01:35:36,932
I don't know.

1093
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:40,694
I looked for him myself.

1094
01:35:40,698 --> 01:35:42,575
He wasn't among the dead.

1095
01:35:47,298 --> 01:35:49,607
I think he either escaped to the forest
or he was captured.

1096
01:35:51,057 --> 01:35:52,172
Send two men. Search for him.

1097
01:35:52,177 --> 01:35:54,008
I already sent men to the forest.

1098
01:35:58,417 --> 01:35:59,770
He'll be all right.

1099
01:36:01,817 --> 01:36:03,933
He's braver than most men.

1100
01:36:06,776 --> 01:36:07,970
This is true.

1101
01:36:12,216 --> 01:36:13,365
Leave me alone.

1102
01:36:13,376 --> 01:36:15,014
Get my horse ready.

1103
01:36:23,015 --> 01:36:24,528
Oh, God.

1104
01:36:27,215 --> 01:36:28,568
Victoriano.

1105
01:36:39,974 --> 01:36:41,930
That is my boy.

1106
01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:48,133
We let him down.

1107
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:52,891
He inspires me,
and we let him down.

1108
01:37:00,693 --> 01:37:02,046
This is, um-

1109
01:37:03,293 --> 01:37:04,281
Here.

1110
01:37:05,212 --> 01:37:06,406
I found that...

1111
01:37:07,732 --> 01:37:09,211
where I left him.

1112
01:37:13,652 --> 01:37:15,085
That was his.

1113
01:37:53,529 --> 01:37:54,598
Jose!

1114
01:37:59,889 --> 01:38:01,368
Jose!

1115
01:38:08,008 --> 01:38:13,924
Jose!

1116
01:38:18,327 --> 01:38:20,045
Thank you.

1117
01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:21,036
How are you?

1118
01:38:21,047 --> 01:38:22,116
Not good.

1119
01:38:24,087 --> 01:38:30,560
A scout tells us that General Rodriguez
is heading towards Tepatitlan

1120
01:38:30,567 --> 01:38:31,919
to set up headquarters.

1121
01:38:33,686 --> 01:38:37,281
This will be one of the most
important battles of our struggle.

1122
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:40,962
I'm entrusting it to you...

1123
01:38:44,966 --> 01:38:48,321
with Pedroza and Victoriano
under your command.

1124
01:38:49,365 --> 01:38:50,400
I'm ready, Commander.

1125
01:38:50,405 --> 01:38:54,796
You, Pedroza and Victoriano
will be in Tepatitlan in two days.

1126
01:38:54,805 --> 01:38:56,397
We can pull some more troops in.

1127
01:38:56,405 --> 01:38:58,680
If you get there first,
it will not be necessary.

1128
01:38:58,685 --> 01:39:00,323
You go into the city.

1129
01:39:00,325 --> 01:39:01,643
You look for vantage points-

1130
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:03,475
buildings, rooftops, behind walls,

1131
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:04,883
sheltered places.

1132
01:39:04,884 --> 01:39:06,920
There will be not one Cristero in sight.

1133
01:40:36,918 --> 01:40:40,274
Padre, can't you see the gun?

1134
01:40:43,358 --> 01:40:45,473
We have to attack now.

1135
01:40:57,317 --> 01:40:58,432
Hyah!

1136
01:41:00,236 --> 01:41:01,669
What the hell is he doing?

1137
01:41:22,195 --> 01:41:23,310
Fuego!

1138
01:41:42,833 --> 01:41:46,189
Catorce!

1139
01:42:09,592 --> 01:42:10,991
Did we get the-

1140
01:42:10,992 --> 01:42:12,344
Did we get the machine gun?

1141
01:42:12,351 --> 01:42:13,500
Yes.

1142
01:42:14,551 --> 01:42:15,540
Yes.

1143
01:42:15,551 --> 01:42:17,064
Yes. Yes.

1144
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:21,582
Okay.

1145
01:42:21,591 --> 01:42:23,104
Viva Cristo Rey.

1146
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:30,139
Que viva.

1147
01:43:02,828 --> 01:43:04,500
In nomine Patris
et Fili et Spiritus Sanctus.

1148
01:43:12,667 --> 01:43:13,986
Well done, Victoriano.

1149
01:43:20,627 --> 01:43:21,901
Ah, Lalo.

1150
01:43:28,626 --> 01:43:31,698
- Lalo, are you a strong rider?
- Yes, sir.

1151
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:33,981
I want you to ride
like the wind to Sahuayo.

1152
01:43:33,986 --> 01:43:35,419
Find out if Jose is there.

1153
01:43:35,426 --> 01:43:37,576
You report back to me
as soon as possible.

1154
01:43:38,586 --> 01:43:39,985
Yes, sir.

1155
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:53,777
You're only alive because
the capitan knows your padrino.

1156
01:44:05,544 --> 01:44:07,933
Are they going to kill us?

1157
01:44:23,063 --> 01:44:24,973
I don't want to die.

1158
01:44:26,382 --> 01:44:28,134
I'm scared, too, Lorenzo.

1159
01:44:39,101 --> 01:44:42,411
This is what happens when you don't
tell me what I need to know.

1160
01:44:43,421 --> 01:44:44,740
Pull.

1161
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,091
No! No!

1162
01:45:11,019 --> 01:45:12,532
Muevete.

1163
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:14,177
Get out!

1164
01:45:28,018 --> 01:45:29,974
I'm going to take you home, Jose.

1165
01:45:31,778 --> 01:45:33,530
I'm going to take you home.

1166
01:45:36,138 --> 01:45:38,935
Just-Just say the words.

1167
01:45:38,937 --> 01:45:41,132
"Death to Cristo Rey.

1168
01:45:41,137 --> 01:45:43,412
Long live the federal government. "

1169
01:45:46,697 --> 01:45:47,846
No, Padrino.

1170
01:45:49,177 --> 01:45:51,133
They're just words.

1171
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,172
I- I can't, Padrino.

1172
01:45:53,176 --> 01:45:56,134
Just f-for your mother.

1173
01:45:59,696 --> 01:46:01,175
Viva Cristo Rey.

1174
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,528
Your luck has run out.

1175
01:46:51,612 --> 01:46:52,647
- Bishop Diaz?
- Yes.

1176
01:46:52,652 --> 01:46:54,165
- Bishop Ruiz?
- Yes.

1177
01:46:54,172 --> 01:46:57,005
Dwight Morrow.
What a pleasure.

1178
01:46:57,012 --> 01:46:59,401
The pleasure is ours,
Mr. Ambassador.

1179
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:01,130
Would you care for some tea?

1180
01:47:01,132 --> 01:47:02,121
Please join us.

1181
01:47:02,132 --> 01:47:03,531
Oh, superb, superb.

1182
01:47:03,532 --> 01:47:06,045
The prospects of the trip
have improved already.

1183
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:15,964
Mr. Ambassador...

1184
01:47:17,331 --> 01:47:19,003
who actually invited us?

1185
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:23,487
It's important to everyone.

1186
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:27,400
And I've been working
with President Calles

1187
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:29,560
to try and find a solution
to this madness.

1188
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:34,968
We are ready to listen
and to bring the message to Rome.

1189
01:47:36,529 --> 01:47:38,599
Well, I know Rome
and the top prelates

1190
01:47:38,609 --> 01:47:40,918
have not publicly claimed support
for the Cristeros,

1191
01:47:40,929 --> 01:47:42,920
but neither have they disowned them.

1192
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:46,965
And in this situation,
their silence is deafening.

1193
01:47:46,969 --> 01:47:49,880
This whole thing has been-

1194
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:52,243
It's been an unnecessary tragedy.

1195
01:47:52,248 --> 01:47:54,284
And Calles himself sees that now,

1196
01:47:54,288 --> 01:47:58,201
and he's ready to find a compromise
with the Church.

1197
01:47:58,208 --> 01:48:00,517
What is critical is that we reach
an agreement soon

1198
01:48:00,528 --> 01:48:03,281
so that the killings stop

1199
01:48:03,288 --> 01:48:05,198
and services can begin again in peace,

1200
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:07,675
and with peace comes
stability and prosperity.

1201
01:48:18,127 --> 01:48:21,402
Peace and stability, Mr. Ambassador?

1202
01:48:27,246 --> 01:48:31,637
Gentlemen, would you excuse me
for a moment?

1203
01:48:31,646 --> 01:48:32,681
Of course.

1204
01:49:14,043 --> 01:49:14,919
Jose.

1205
01:49:18,682 --> 01:49:19,797
Lalo.

1206
01:49:21,562 --> 01:49:24,201
The general sent me
to see if you were here.

1207
01:49:25,202 --> 01:49:26,681
You have to go.

1208
01:49:28,002 --> 01:49:29,833
La Guada could see you.

1209
01:49:31,282 --> 01:49:32,999
Hold on.

1210
01:49:34,641 --> 01:49:37,394
I'm in God's hands, Lalo.

1211
01:49:41,761 --> 01:49:45,470
Go. Before they see you.

1212
01:50:02,439 --> 01:50:04,031
A complete pardon

1213
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:06,553
for the entire Cristero army?

1214
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:11,352
What should we do with
their leadership?

1215
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,432
Give them a parade with confetti
all the way up to Chapultepec Castle?

1216
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:17,827
Well, the pardon must be universal,

1217
01:50:17,838 --> 01:50:20,830
specifically including the leadership,

1218
01:50:20,838 --> 01:50:22,510
or there won't be an accord.

1219
01:50:30,398 --> 01:50:34,072
How many men did you lose
with General Rodriguez in Tepatitlan?

1220
01:50:36,437 --> 01:50:38,712
5,000? 6,000?

1221
01:50:46,956 --> 01:50:49,948
Just how many more
are you prepared to lose?

1222
01:50:53,036 --> 01:50:56,631
And Rome?
Will it accept the other terms?

1223
01:51:00,316 --> 01:51:03,113
I believe I can arrange a meeting
with the bishops

1224
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:04,946
to confirm their support.

1225
01:51:11,195 --> 01:51:13,186
Before I give you my answer,

1226
01:51:13,195 --> 01:51:15,867
there is something I need to do first.

1227
01:51:15,874 --> 01:51:16,863
What's that?

1228
01:51:18,154 --> 01:51:19,587
Go see an old friend.

1229
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:44,710
Frankly, I thought you would not come.

1230
01:51:52,072 --> 01:51:53,425
You came to me.

1231
01:51:53,432 --> 01:51:55,388
This is Cristero country.

1232
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,781
This is Mexico, Enrique.

1233
01:51:57,792 --> 01:51:59,066
Please join me.

1234
01:52:06,391 --> 01:52:07,380
How's the family?

1235
01:52:09,591 --> 01:52:10,785
Your wife, Tulita?

1236
01:52:13,391 --> 01:52:14,982
She's very excited.

1237
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:21,268
Church bells will be
ringing freely very soon.

1238
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:23,459
Salud.

1239
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:25,108
Viva Cristo Rey.

1240
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:34,463
Your war is coming to an end very soon.

1241
01:52:34,469 --> 01:52:35,743
You're here to concede?

1242
01:52:38,109 --> 01:52:39,622
Not quite, no.

1243
01:52:40,869 --> 01:52:42,188
It's not my war.

1244
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:44,742
It's your war.

1245
01:52:46,028 --> 01:52:48,622
You declared war on freedom.

1246
01:52:54,748 --> 01:52:57,945
I know you for a long time,
and I know you're not a fool,

1247
01:52:57,948 --> 01:53:02,304
so you must know this war
is not about freedom,

1248
01:53:02,307 --> 01:53:04,775
and it's not about religion.

1249
01:53:04,787 --> 01:53:08,860
It's about who is going to decide
the fate of Mexico and its people.

1250
01:53:09,787 --> 01:53:11,857
Well, the people of Mexico
have spoken.

1251
01:53:11,867 --> 01:53:16,986
They did speak when they elected me
President, not you.

1252
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:19,295
I run things in this country.

1253
01:53:19,306 --> 01:53:20,341
Not for long.

1254
01:53:22,946 --> 01:53:27,064
An agreement is being discussed.

1255
01:53:27,066 --> 01:53:30,580
Mexico and Rome
are going to make peace.

1256
01:53:31,385 --> 01:53:32,261
An agreement?

1257
01:53:34,105 --> 01:53:36,938
No one wants this war anymore, Enrique.

1258
01:53:42,904 --> 01:53:45,020
Mexico is bleeding on its own fields.

1259
01:53:46,984 --> 01:53:52,104
Mexico is hanging from telegraph poles
from Monterrey to Veracruz.

1260
01:53:52,139 --> 01:53:53,253
Of course you need an agreement.

1261
01:53:55,104 --> 01:53:58,095
But freedom has no compromise.

1262
01:53:58,103 --> 01:53:59,855
By definition, it is absolute,

1263
01:53:59,863 --> 01:54:02,138
and that's why we will be victorious.

1264
01:54:04,143 --> 01:54:06,259
Keep your agreement.

1265
01:54:07,663 --> 01:54:11,417
Please spare me
your rhetorical idealism

1266
01:54:11,423 --> 01:54:15,256
and tell me,
what do you really want?

1267
01:54:15,262 --> 01:54:16,456
Absolute freedom.

1268
01:54:16,462 --> 01:54:17,656
Is that in the agreement?

1269
01:54:18,982 --> 01:54:21,576
The agreement is all but sealed.

1270
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:35,733
This is yours, your agreement.
It's not ours.

1271
01:54:37,341 --> 01:54:39,730
You're holding your fate in your hands.

1272
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:44,419
The fate of Mexico,

1273
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:45,899
the destiny of Mexico...

1274
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:51,456
it's in God's hands,
not yours or mine.

1275
01:54:56,499 --> 01:54:57,978
Que viva Cristo Rey.

1276
01:55:17,698 --> 01:55:22,135
The American Ambassador Morrow
has made a preliminary agreement

1277
01:55:22,138 --> 01:55:25,652
between the government
of Mexico and Rome.

1278
01:55:25,657 --> 01:55:27,773
An agreement?
What kind of an agreement?

1279
01:55:28,737 --> 01:55:34,892
The Church has been asked
to forgo half of its demands.

1280
01:55:34,897 --> 01:55:41,369
In return, the government will loosen
some restrictions on the clergy.

1281
01:55:41,376 --> 01:55:42,650
What does that mean exactly?

1282
01:55:43,776 --> 01:55:45,573
The extreme laws will be rescinded.

1283
01:55:47,016 --> 01:55:48,495
Others will be...

1284
01:55:49,536 --> 01:55:52,050
officially unenforced.

1285
01:55:52,816 --> 01:55:54,215
And then what?

1286
01:55:54,216 --> 01:55:57,127
With Rome's blessing,

1287
01:55:57,135 --> 01:56:00,764
the church bells could be
ringing again within a month.

1288
01:56:00,775 --> 01:56:03,084
My brother died for this.

1289
01:56:03,095 --> 01:56:04,574
For what?

1290
01:56:06,575 --> 01:56:09,134
Mi General,
what should we do?

1291
01:56:13,534 --> 01:56:15,411
We will defeat this government,

1292
01:56:15,414 --> 01:56:16,813
we will overthrow Calles,

1293
01:56:16,814 --> 01:56:19,123
and we will establish
a democratic government

1294
01:56:19,134 --> 01:56:21,489
that respects
the rights of the people!

1295
01:56:21,494 --> 01:56:24,929
Especially the basic right
to worship God in peace.

1296
01:56:26,373 --> 01:56:28,933
And with God on our side,
we will prevail.

1297
01:56:47,172 --> 01:56:49,163
I wish I had your faith.

1298
01:56:53,052 --> 01:56:54,723
Jose's faith.

1299
01:57:00,611 --> 01:57:02,044
I don't know where to find it.

1300
01:57:03,731 --> 01:57:05,130
If your heart's open,

1301
01:57:06,451 --> 01:57:07,600
it might find you.

1302
01:57:38,328 --> 01:57:40,080
In a few seconds,
you're going to beg me

1303
01:57:40,088 --> 01:57:44,127
to let you spit on Cristo Rey.

1304
01:57:59,567 --> 01:58:04,687
Jesus nos da fuerzas!

1305
01:58:04,722 --> 01:58:09,476
Do you have anything to tell me?

1306
01:58:11,006 --> 01:58:13,361
Viva Cristo Rey!

1307
01:58:15,286 --> 01:58:17,322
Viva Cristo Rey!

1308
01:58:18,646 --> 01:58:22,604
Viva Cristo Rey!

1309
01:58:30,605 --> 01:58:33,517
And what about going through Colotlan
to get to get to Tlaltenango?

1310
01:58:33,525 --> 01:58:36,561
No, better through Aguascalientes.
It's safer.

1311
01:58:36,564 --> 01:58:39,078
General! They have Jose.

1312
01:58:39,084 --> 01:58:40,233
They're going to kill him.

1313
01:58:40,244 --> 01:58:41,962
- In Sahuayo?
- Yes, sir.

1314
01:58:45,004 --> 01:58:47,120
Teniente, you plus 10 men come with me!

1315
01:58:47,124 --> 01:58:48,716
- The rest, return to camp!
- Si, mi General.

1316
01:58:48,724 --> 01:58:50,237
Desmonte. Vaya.

1317
01:58:50,244 --> 01:58:51,722
10 caballos y 10 jinetes
con el General.

1318
01:58:51,723 --> 01:58:53,554
El resto se regresa
al campamento. Ya!

1319
01:58:53,563 --> 01:58:55,997
Ho! Hah!

1320
02:00:42,236 --> 02:00:43,225
J ust say the words.

1321
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:44,555
You can go home.

1322
02:00:53,515 --> 02:00:55,346
I love you.

1323
02:01:04,714 --> 02:01:06,909
Viva Cristo Rey.

1324
02:01:56,671 --> 02:01:58,502
I'm going home.

1325
02:03:45,783 --> 02:03:47,660
Why couldn't I save him?

1326
02:03:52,743 --> 02:03:53,619
You tried.

1327
02:03:57,703 --> 02:03:59,852
What kind of God
would allow that to happen?

1328
02:04:03,622 --> 02:04:06,534
God allows us
the freedom to choose.

1329
02:04:08,262 --> 02:04:09,900
Some choose to be evil.

1330
02:04:11,302 --> 02:04:14,134
But God can take even
the most horrific events

1331
02:04:14,141 --> 02:04:15,938
and use them for good.

1332
02:04:17,861 --> 02:04:18,850
Like the cross.

1333
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:26,776
Maybe Jose wasn't supposed to be saved.

1334
02:04:26,781 --> 02:04:28,771
How could you even say that?

1335
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:33,809
He-He was just a little boy.

1336
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:39,049
He had a whole life in front of him.

1337
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:43,212
Even as a boy...

1338
02:04:45,019 --> 02:04:47,294
he was a martyr.

1339
02:04:47,299 --> 02:04:50,848
We never know what God has in mind.

1340
02:04:51,779 --> 02:04:53,451
What God has in mind?

1341
02:04:54,339 --> 02:04:56,250
What does He have in mind?

1342
02:04:56,259 --> 02:04:58,249
That Rome should turn its back on us...

1343
02:05:00,298 --> 02:05:02,493
and all the people that have
given their lives for Him?

1344
02:05:02,498 --> 02:05:03,726
That's what He has in mind?

1345
02:05:07,418 --> 02:05:09,295
Who are you going to obey?

1346
02:05:09,698 --> 02:05:10,608
Rome or me?

1347
02:05:19,817 --> 02:05:23,492
I am a priest first, mi comandante.

1348
02:05:27,136 --> 02:05:29,366
You can still be a priest,
after everything you've done?

1349
02:05:32,456 --> 02:05:34,447
I will always be a priest.

1350
02:05:38,736 --> 02:05:42,569
And I will pray every day...

1351
02:05:44,775 --> 02:05:49,087
for our merciful God to forgive me.

1352
02:05:53,255 --> 02:05:54,290
What about me?

1353
02:05:58,854 --> 02:05:59,843
Will you pray for me?

1354
02:06:04,934 --> 02:06:07,164
Will you pray for what I've done?

1355
02:06:10,814 --> 02:06:12,292
Better pray hard.

1356
02:06:29,012 --> 02:06:30,127
Check.

1357
02:06:40,851 --> 02:06:43,240
I resign. I'm tired.

1358
02:06:53,851 --> 02:06:56,523
I miss my wife Tulita and the girls.

1359
02:07:20,169 --> 02:07:23,161
This young man died for us!

1360
02:07:23,169 --> 02:07:24,840
Viva Cristo Rey.

1361
02:07:50,087 --> 02:07:52,282
Vega!

1362
02:07:57,926 --> 02:07:58,915
How many?

1363
02:07:58,926 --> 02:07:59,915
I don't know.

1364
02:08:33,524 --> 02:08:35,435
I want to confess.

1365
02:08:35,444 --> 02:08:37,639
- Now?
- Now.

1366
02:08:37,644 --> 02:08:40,555
We need to make a run for the horses,
get to a safe position.

1367
02:08:40,563 --> 02:08:42,679
Let's go around the back.

1368
02:08:55,882 --> 02:08:58,077
Are you a priest first, or aren't you?

1369
02:08:58,082 --> 02:09:00,312
Didn't you say not to worry about
those who can kill the body,

1370
02:09:00,322 --> 02:09:02,313
but those who can kill the soul?

1371
02:09:06,242 --> 02:09:07,560
It was something like that.

1372
02:09:07,561 --> 02:09:10,792
So... you were listening.

1373
02:09:12,121 --> 02:09:14,555
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis,

1374
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:16,199
in nomine Patris

1375
02:09:16,201 --> 02:09:19,113
et Fili et Spiritus Sancti.

1376
02:09:19,121 --> 02:09:21,715
Amen.

1377
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:32,193
Padre, this is between you and me.

1378
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:34,509
And Him.

1379
02:09:45,239 --> 02:09:46,558
They're everywhere!

1380
02:09:57,678 --> 02:10:00,351
- They're all on the roof.
- Come on.

1381
02:10:03,398 --> 02:10:05,195
Not for long.

1382
02:10:10,717 --> 02:10:12,070
Bullets.

1383
02:10:16,157 --> 02:10:17,192
How are you feeling?

1384
02:10:19,517 --> 02:10:20,506
Viva Cristo Rey.

1385
02:10:22,916 --> 02:10:24,508
Viva Cristo Rey!

1386
02:10:24,516 --> 02:10:25,710
Follow me.

1387
02:10:39,035 --> 02:10:40,263
Disparen!

1388
02:10:41,355 --> 02:10:42,344
Ready?

1389
02:10:51,874 --> 02:10:53,592
Load up.

1390
02:10:54,314 --> 02:10:56,782
Padre, can you confess yourself?

1391
02:10:56,794 --> 02:10:58,113
No.

1392
02:11:00,074 --> 02:11:01,427
Then I will try.

1393
02:11:05,433 --> 02:11:06,912
Padre Vega is a good man.

1394
02:11:06,913 --> 02:11:10,189
He served You well,
as well as he could,

1395
02:11:10,193 --> 02:11:12,343
and that's all anyone can ask of us,

1396
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:14,343
so forgive him...

1397
02:11:16,153 --> 02:11:18,109
and have mercy on us both.

1398
02:11:19,553 --> 02:11:20,428
Amen.

1399
02:11:28,512 --> 02:11:29,661
Padre!

1400
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:36,587
Okay, stay with me.

1401
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:41,827
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1402
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:52,584
Teniente!

1403
02:11:55,230 --> 02:11:56,265
Gather the horses.

1404
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:59,228
I want the men and Padre Vega
out of here immediately.

1405
02:12:01,110 --> 02:12:02,828
Okay, talk to me.

1406
02:12:03,949 --> 02:12:05,985
Stay with me. T alk to me.

1407
02:12:06,709 --> 02:12:08,062
Your confession...

1408
02:12:10,509 --> 02:12:13,262
You make a better general
than a priest.

1409
02:12:14,269 --> 02:12:15,258
Mi General.

1410
02:12:15,269 --> 02:12:16,463
Okay, here we go.

1411
02:12:26,668 --> 02:12:28,659
Teniente, what they want is me.

1412
02:12:28,668 --> 02:12:30,863
Get the men back to El Lucero.

1413
02:12:30,868 --> 02:12:33,939
And get Padre Vega to a doctor...

1414
02:12:33,947 --> 02:12:35,699
- and a real priest.
- Mi General-

1415
02:12:35,707 --> 02:12:36,856
Do as I say.

1416
02:12:36,867 --> 02:12:39,017
Padre, que viva-

1417
02:12:39,027 --> 02:12:40,346
Padre! Padre!

1418
02:12:40,347 --> 02:12:41,336
Que viva Cristo Rey!

1419
02:12:41,347 --> 02:12:42,700
Que viva.

1420
02:12:44,387 --> 02:12:46,298
Que viva!

1421
02:12:48,546 --> 02:12:50,423
Cristeros!

1422
02:12:59,746 --> 02:13:02,135
Viva Cristo Rey!

1423
02:13:02,146 --> 02:13:03,294
Fuego directo!

1424
02:13:51,982 --> 02:13:55,292
We never know
what God has in mind.

1425
02:13:55,302 --> 02:13:57,133
You cannot fight for something
you don't believe in.

1426
02:13:57,142 --> 02:14:00,532
I believe in religious freedom,
and I believe in you.

1427
02:14:00,542 --> 02:14:04,534
God allows us
the freedom to choose.

1428
02:14:04,541 --> 02:14:06,816
I believe in what you
would be fighting for.

1429
02:14:06,821 --> 02:14:08,812
Maybe by doing it, you will, too.

1430
02:14:08,821 --> 02:14:13,372
God can take even the most horrific events
and use them for good.

1431
02:14:13,381 --> 02:14:15,019
Viva Cristo Rey.

1432
02:14:15,021 --> 02:14:16,089
Que viva.
