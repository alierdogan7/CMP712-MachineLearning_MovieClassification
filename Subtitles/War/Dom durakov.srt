What are you morons ogling at?

32
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,927
Who takes those trains
these days?

33
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:38,053
Nothing but cheap dealers.

34
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:41,098
Everyone's smuggling stuff
somewhere.

35
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,850
Russia's got the clothing fever.

36
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:45,476
And our Little Nell

37
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,106
is posing like some Greek statue
in the Pushkin Museum.

38
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:55,693
Ever heard of that museum,
you shitheads?

39
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:59,298
Cleaning detail, finish up.
The rest of you, get to bed.

40
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,845
You hear me?

41
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:08,932
Yes, sir!

42
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,024
So, you losers, seen enough?

43
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,192
Had your little fix?
Shame on you.

44
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:25,321
War and stupidity
will feed this generation.

45
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:27,573
A generation of junkies
and trash.

46
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:29,699
I spit in your faces.

47
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,910
"Thunder rumbles on the front

48
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:35,913
"My boots tramp on regardless

49
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,332
"Charge, onwards
to the enemy!"

50
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:40,125
Wipe that up, please.

51
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:42,419
Get lost, scumbag.

52
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,461
Wipe it up.

53
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:47,131
I spit on you all,

54
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:50,467
the runts and the tyrants,

55
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,553
Iinks in the chain of strength
trampling my homeland!

56
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:20,159
Physical abuse is illegal.

57
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:22,744
That's a violation of the law

58
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:24,913
on psychiatric care

59
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,206
and the rights of the citizen

60
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:29,334
adopted in July 1992

61
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,502
by the Supreme Soviet.

62
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,378
-Wipe it up!
-I'll do it!

63
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,297
Wait.

64
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,424
Leave her alone.
She has bad nerves.

65
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:41,844
-She spat, she cleans it up.
-Who do you think you are?

66
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,805
To give me orders!

67
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,932
You maniac, schizophrenic

68
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,393
bald scribbler!

69
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,525
Maniac, schizophrenic,

70
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,401
bald scribbler!

71
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:08,158
A man must not force a woman.

72
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:14,163
You animal! Goddamn screw!
Flunky!

73
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,373
In the camp, guys like you

74
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:20,501
were smothered under mattresses.

75
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,503
-Get up!
-Come on!

76
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,631
You're humiliating humanity.

77
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:27,716
Your turn will come one day.

78
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,886
Just wait a while

79
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:34,973
and we'll change places.

80
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,482
I'll spit and you'll wipe it up.

81
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,367
"Sit down by my side

82
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,129
"Take me in your arms and sing

83
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,048
"l feel so alone without you

84
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,384
"But complete when you're near"

85
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,851
Open up! Who locked me in?

86
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:35,733
Crazy bitch.

87
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,194
"Sit down by my side..."

88
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,694
Good morning, my love.

89
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:09,029
He's covered in fly shit again.

90
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,033
Damn things!
I thought I'd killed them all.

91
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:18,037
I dreamt he sang me
love songs again.

92
00:11:18,037 --> 00:11:21,039
I dreamt of cocks again.

93
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:26,044
Cocks with wings like angels
flying all around me.

94
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,045
He's missing me so much.

95
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,173
I can tell he's waiting for me.

96
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,592
Give it a rest.
I bet he already has a wife.

97
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:37,846
Are you stupid, Lucia, or what?

98
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:40,515
She's a girlfriend.
He doesn't love her.

99
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:42,975
He knows he has a fiancee
in Russia.

100
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:46,853
For the wedding day,

101
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:51,023
I'll buy a big white hat.
Hats really suit me.

102
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,901
Lucia! There! There it is!

103
00:11:57,112 --> 00:12:01,031
Bastard!
I'll beat the shit out of you!

104
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:02,658
Quiet!

105
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:18,671
It's dead.

106
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,474
Stop pushing.

107
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,270
You're not getting through,
I'm next!

108
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:41,190
-What about your toilet?
-Flooded again.

109
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,818
You'll crap all over ours again.

110
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:48,781
Have you seen Goga?

111
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:50,949
You haven't seen him?

112
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,659
Goga!

113
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,744
We'll miss our turn!

114
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,167
Have you seen Goga anywhere?

115
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:12,885
-Has Mahmud been here?
-Yeah, but he's gone again.

116
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:16,096
Where's my place?
He was keeping it.

117
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:20,057
Get to the back of the line,
Citizen Atanessian.

118
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:24,727
Hey, Tut-tut, come out now!
Shorty's going to burst.

119
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,605
You were keeping my place?
Where am l?

120
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:30,525
I was here
before anyone for you.

121
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:35,904
Gangway!

122
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:38,614
Stop! Let Goga through.

123
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:41,075
I'm going nowhere.

124
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,831
Never!

125
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,639
No privileges here!

126
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,808
This is the women's toilet.

127
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,646
Come on, Shorty's bursting.

128
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,440
A real mafia,
selling places in line.

129
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,905
Get out of there, bitch!
I have a bladder!

130
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,793
Here, this is for later.

131
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,884
And that's for you
so you won't be jealous.

132
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,887
Lucia told me everything.

133
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:56,264
Just think!

134
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:01,226
Be quiet or there'll be trouble!
Understand?

135
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:04,521
See you.

136
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:07,732
See you.

137
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,404
Doctor,

138
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:17,907
are we eating
with the women again?

139
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,868
Don't you like it?

140
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,662
Oh, we do!

141
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:26,415
If you behave,

142
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:31,044
you can eat with them
every day.

143
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,880
That's a violation

144
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:39,634
of the rules governing
psychiatric care.

145
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,844
Vika, our rules

146
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:45,640
were written ages ago.

147
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,307
In America,

148
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,893
they've done it for years.

149
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:52,520
The quiet patients eat together.

150
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:55,272
It has a beneficial effect.

151
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:01,778
But if you'd rather eat alone,
that's no problem.

152
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,614
Doctor, can you give me
something

153
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,116
so I don't need to poo?

154
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:10,577
I'm sick to death

155
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,370
of having to queue every day.

156
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:15,999
You can't have it all, Mahmud.

157
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,043
Life's like that.

158
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:22,504
Like what?

159
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,714
Well...

160
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,593
It's when new shit
is produced every day.

161
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:36,975
Nothing to laugh about.

162
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,646
That definition

163
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,732
has a certain depth to it.

164
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,279
Misha!

165
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:52,446
Wait!

166
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:01,245
Roustam, watch Vika closely!

167
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,496
Do your best!

168
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,541
1, 2, 3, 4...

169
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,335
Go on! Well done, Zoia!

170
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,882
Now, the bridge!

171
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:18,760
Let's stop and do the bridge!
Lie down!

172
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:21,554
Heads towards me!

173
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:23,347
Good, Lucia!

174
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,893
Well done! Congratulations!

175
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:31,104
Zoia's the best at it.

176
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,773
Vika, careful!

177
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,316
You'll break your neck!

178
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:38,360
Janna, look, I'm a yogi!

179
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:42,113
Well done, Shorty!
Give him a round of applause.

180
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:45,115
Well done, Shorty!

181
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,118
Give him a big hand!

182
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,828
It wasn't me!

183
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,705
Hurray! We're burning!

184
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:06,301
"Two guitars behind the wall

185
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:08,761
"Strike up a sad song...

186
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:15,683
"You and I lie together

187
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,686
"On a narrow bed

188
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:23,190
"You stare at the ceiling

189
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,692
"And seem to count the flies

190
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:29,362
"l feel so lonely

191
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:32,823
"And you don't even see"

192
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,753
Can I have your porridge?

193
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,594
-Who's that?
-Grandpa.

194
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:13,565
A tooth!

195
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:15,943
A tooth in my porridge!

196
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:18,028
A human tooth!

197
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:26,744
You know what this means,
comrades?

198
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:31,331
Imagine what they're feeding us
if our teeth are falling out.

199
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,637
I want to know.

200
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,097
Who did this?

201
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:52,265
Who gave Mahmud matches?

202
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:55,477
-You don't know?
-Who's asking you?

203
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,193
Who's going to own up?

204
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,403
I warned you

205
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:09,864
not to give him matches.

206
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:15,285
Do you want
to be burned alive or what?

207
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,829
He's capable of it!

208
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:20,123
Well?

209
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:23,208
Who'll own up?

210
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:38,638
I already told you it wasn't me.

211
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,889
It wasn't me!

212
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:47,521
Stay away,
you're going to hurt me!

213
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,606
My bladder! Put me down!

214
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,399
Don't touch me.

215
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,828
Aminazine up the backside.

216
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,957
Strap them to their beds.

217
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Very well.

218
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,225
Do we have to force-feed you?

219
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:33,519
Aren't you sick of it?

220
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,859
You can be so stubborn.

221
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:46,530
You know very well
I'm going to do it.

222
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:07,056
There'll be no train today.

223
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,226
All go back to your rooms.

224
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:14,937
-ls it broken?
-No, it's fine.

225
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,691
He's just tired of pulling
those heavy carriages.

226
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,611
Even iron locomotives
get tired sometimes.

227
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:26,572
All go back quietly
to your rooms.

228
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,964
The phone's cut off
and the radio's dead.

229
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:46,923
What does that mean?

230
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,842
It's not good.

231
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:53,096
We'll have to evacuate
the patients.

232
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:57,432
But we'll need
to find money first.

233
00:23:57,474 --> 00:24:02,102
Fire me if you want, doctor, but
I won't spend the night here.

234
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:53,447
What are you doing?

235
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,074
Give it back!

236
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:58,660
-Let me have a go.
-You'll break it!

237
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:01,079
It's not going to break!

238
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:04,457
"Water flows from the well..."

239
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,627
Tell him. It's my accordion!

240
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,255
Lucia,
they've taken my accordion.

241
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:13,714
What's wrong?

242
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:17,802
They've taken my Shorty away!

243
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,179
That faggot Goga. The asshole!

244
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:23,598
I'll smash his head in
with my iron.

245
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,725
They're in the women's ward.

246
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:02,464
-Who let the violent ward out?
-We did.

247
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:05,801
-What if the doctor finds out?
-He's not here!

248
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:08,094
The rats have deserted the ship!

249
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:12,139
The Communist regime is over!

250
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:13,306
Freedom!

251
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:19,479
Stop it!
You should be ashamed!

252
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:31,948
I'll untie you.

253
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:39,621
Shorty, my love,
are you all right?

254
00:27:39,663 --> 00:27:42,248
Do you like my wig?

255
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,419
It's Claudia's,
the second floor nurse.

256
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:48,796
Open up!

257
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,719
Vika let the violent ward out!

258
00:27:56,761 --> 00:28:00,263
The doctor went for a bus
to evacuate us.

259
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:04,351
I woke up at 4 in the morning.
The place was deserted.

260
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,732
Freedom! Down with Fascism!
Take to the streets!

261
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,530
I'll go.

262
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:28,996
Not a soul.

263
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,749
The coast is clear! Hurray!

264
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:42,174
Down with the bars!

265
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:50,390
Break it down!

266
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,454
Bombs! Mother!

267
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,123
Faster!

268
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,426
-Wash the floor.
-But we're being attacked!

269
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:36,095
Even if it's a world war,
I don't give a shit!

270
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,888
I warned you, Vika!

271
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,267
Play!

272
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:55,361
Will they kill us?

273
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,669
Tank regiments are commanded
by total idiots.

274
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:20,716
You send in the infantry first,
then the tanks.

275
00:30:50,534 --> 00:30:51,826
It wasn't me!

276
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,914
Don't kill me!

277
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:59,207
Don't worry.
We won't hurt you.

278
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:01,000
Don't hurt me.

279
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:02,669
It's nothing to do with me!

280
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,838
Wow! She's hairy.

281
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,298
It's a man.

282
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:29,691
-Where's the doctor?
-Getting buses.

283
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,945
-Who are you?
-Alikhan.

284
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:37,656
I need a room without windows
for the prisoners.

285
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:39,742
In the basement.

286
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:43,203
Spirit and bandages
for the casualties.

287
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:47,206
Upstairs,
in the interns' office.

288
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:50,750
But the violent patients
have locked themselves in.

289
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:58,633
Cut it, instead of staring!

290
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:03,095
Will you fucking cut it or not?

291
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:17,566
-We need spirit.
-I have some cologne.

292
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,943
Over here.

293
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,949
Hold me down.

294
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,242
Pour it on!

295
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,000
That hurts.

296
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:44,463
Hello.

297
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:48,967
What's the sense in sending
three of you to cover her?

298
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,426
She never listens!

299
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,555
We told her not to go!
We couldn't stop her!

300
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,682
You lay down your life
for a sniper.

301
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,018
Calm down. Got any antibiotics?

302
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,354
Hand them over.

303
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,693
She's a woman?

304
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:14,072
Yes, a Lithuanian.
With nerves of steel.

305
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:25,248
-ls the basement this way?
-Yes.

306
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,925
Did we scare you?

307
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:40,886
What are you, a bandit group?

308
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:49,310
This is Shorty.

309
00:33:49,352 --> 00:33:51,854
Janna, I'm hungry.

310
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,481
Everyone's hungry.

311
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:57,692
I haven't eaten a thing all day.

312
00:34:02,655 --> 00:34:04,531
Let go of me!

313
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,773
Remember the guy
with the green eyes?

314
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:49,945
As soon as I saw them,
I got goose bumps.

315
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:54,282
Did you see his beard, Zoia?
Nice and soft.

316
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:59,244
You hear? I touched his beard.
It was so soft.

317
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,289
They've taken my accordion
again.

318
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,291
He pressed me up
against the wall

319
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,751
and said he could guess my name.

320
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:10,254
I said,
"You'll never guess."

321
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,977
Hello.

322
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:34,149
Come in and help us.

323
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:47,327
Do you like it?

324
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:52,081
That's my accordion.

325
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:55,625
It is? You know how to play?

326
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,920
I don't believe you!

327
00:36:00,464 --> 00:36:01,464
I do know how.

328
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:03,715
Sit down and show us, then.

329
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:05,926
Come on, don't be afraid.

330
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:27,653
You're pretty. Are you a nurse?

331
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:30,864
-I live here.
-You're sick, then.

332
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:33,324
I used to be
but I'm not anymore.

333
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:34,993
A polka?

334
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,497
Any other pretty girls?

335
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:42,290
Yes.

336
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,959
A lot?

337
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:47,169
There's Lucia.
I share a room with her.

338
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,381
Then there's Sonia.

339
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:52,633
And Vika, she's very beautiful.

340
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:55,677
You play well.

341
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:58,721
-I can dance too.
-You dance?

342
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:01,973
You're kidding us!

343
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:04,810
I'm doing
the circus school exam.

344
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,478
I can even tap-dance.

345
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,396
Incredible! Show us.

346
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:12,441
I don't have the right shoes.

347
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:16,402
Show us anyway.
What music do you want?

348
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,029
Something fast.

349
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,377
Faster.

350
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:50,348
Do you believe me now?

351
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:54,394
What a woman of passion!
Will you marry me?

352
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:56,896
You want to marry me?

353
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:03,234
Marry you?

354
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:06,862
Yes, today. We can hold
the wedding this evening.

355
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:10,573
Are you crazy?
I already have a fiance.

356
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:14,244
Damn! Where is he?

357
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:17,080
In America, on tour.

358
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:20,874
One fiance's not enough
for a woman like you.

359
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,209
One in America, one here.

360
00:38:23,252 --> 00:38:28,589
Ask my friends.
Ahmed never lies.

361
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,633
Bring your accordion tonight.

362
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,054
You will come?

363
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:50,608
I'll be waiting!

364
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:53,735
What a fiance!

365
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:22,093
What's up? You want kebabs?

366
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,766
The Russians are coming!

367
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,901
Ahmed, get up to the roof.
Quick!

368
00:39:46,614 --> 00:39:49,866
MENTAL PATlENTS

369
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,095
Don't shoot!

370
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:15,930
We've an offer to make.

371
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,723
Are you going to shoot?

372
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:22,018
Make sure you don't miss.

373
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:26,398
Don't shoot!

374
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,816
Get out!

375
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:33,612
What do you want?

376
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:36,573
My captain wants to speak
to yours.

377
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:43,245
Captain, come here.

378
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:25,155
Well?

379
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:28,116
We have one of your corpses.

380
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,036
Want to lD it?

381
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:47,800
Check if it's one of ours.

382
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:29,418
Any dope?

383
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:31,170
Two crates of ammo for 5 ounces.

384
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:34,840
1,500 rounds?
What kind of shit is it?

385
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:38,927
Top quality. Try some.
We don't sell crap.

386
00:42:41,971 --> 00:42:45,515
Okay. We'll leave the crates
with the body.

387
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:55,149
Well?

388
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:57,317
It's Salman.

389
00:43:00,154 --> 00:43:02,656
How much?

390
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:04,114
Two thousand bucks.

391
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,660
Tell Mahomet, he'll fix it.

392
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:10,787
Take Askhab and get the body.

393
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:22,797
Let's sit down a while
and count the money.

394
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,676
All right.

395
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:38,311
A villager said he was yours.

396
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:40,479
If not, we wouldn't have known.

397
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,946
Count out two thousand.

398
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:03,957
No hundred-dollar bills?

399
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:06,334
Small bills aren't money
for you?

400
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:12,757
You went begging
to gather all that together?

401
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:22,097
Fuck me!

402
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,310
The 20th Paratrooper Regiment.

403
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:31,106
You were in Afghanistan, then?

404
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:36,527
Did you guys save our asses
in the Chungur ambush?

405
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:44,658
Your commander
had a stammer.

406
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,702
Poltavchenko, a great guy.

407
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:48,787
You said it.

408
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:09,012
What's your name?

409
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:43,083
There's time for a quick joint.

410
00:46:03,017 --> 00:46:05,102
You'll really marry me?

411
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,989
It went off by accident!

412
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:27,787
Hold your fire!

413
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,459
Our captain's over there!

414
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:36,253
You fuckwits!

415
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:40,716
Are you totally wasted?

416
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:42,842
Sir...

417
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,843
Shut it!

418
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,971
You'll end up in deeper shit!

419
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,351
Captain!

420
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,478
Wait!

421
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,313
Get back in!

422
00:46:57,355 --> 00:46:59,314
Hurry!

423
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:01,775
You forgot the money!

424
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:03,776
We'll manage without it!

425
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:07,738
We had an agreement.

426
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,699
Give it to your mullah!

427
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:17,121
I owe you that after Chungur.

428
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:36,471
I'm sorry.
You will forgive me, won't you?

429
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:41,684
I'll pray for you every day.
I won't abandon you.

430
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:51,859
You'll find someone else.

431
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:08,957
What are you doing?

432
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:13,419
-Nothing.
-Where are you going?

433
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:17,172
Lucia, are you afraid of men?

434
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:21,509
Me? Yes. I don't know... No.

435
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:26,430
I'm getting married.
He asked for my hand.

436
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:27,556
Who?

437
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:30,350
The best-looking Chechen,
in a black hat.

438
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:37,648
He plays the accordion too.
It takes your breath away.

439
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:40,317
That's it!

440
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:55,580
I can't cheat on him.

441
00:48:55,622 --> 00:48:57,498
On who?

442
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,958
Bryan.

443
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,794
He'll find two new ones.

444
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:14,221
You can have
my new patent leather shoes.

445
00:49:14,263 --> 00:49:16,181
No, I can't accept.

446
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:20,184
Take them, please.

447
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:23,437
I'll just try them on, then.

448
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:29,191
Perfect.

449
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:43,162
If Bryan comes tomorrow,
what'll you tell him?

450
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:47,583
Go, don't turn down your chance
to be happy. Go!

451
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:49,459
Go!

452
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:51,711
No, I can't go!

453
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:04,764
It only happens once
in a lifetime, never twice.

454
00:50:12,146 --> 00:50:13,146
So?

455
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:20,402
I have some presents
for you too.

456
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:27,742
Goga, here. "The Miraculous
Power of Water".

457
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:29,243
Thank you.

458
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:32,371
Zoia...

459
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:35,415
-My toy elephant.
-I'll take it later.

460
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:40,002
Take it now, I'm going.

461
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,378
Thank you.

462
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,839
A silver spoon

463
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:46,675
for your first baby.

464
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:48,885
Can I have your accordion?

465
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:57,684
I can't, it's my breadwinner.

466
00:50:57,726 --> 00:51:00,520
As my dad, the human torso,
used to say.

467
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,357
Hi, everyone.

468
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:15,532
Janna, I've never been good
at giving presents

469
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:19,702
but I don't think
this will spoil things,

470
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,371
far from it, in fact.

471
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:23,998
I wish you happiness.

472
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,166
I only wore it once.

473
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,002
A hat!

474
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,673
I've dreamt of one.

475
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,635
Hats suit me so well!

476
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:40,386
To be honest,

477
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:43,181
I never thought
you'd do something like this.

478
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:45,683
It's a powerful symbol.

479
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:48,060
As the world ignores
this tragedy,

480
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:51,855
you're marrying a man
who is fighting

481
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:55,608
against Russian
imperialist policy.

482
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,861
It's an act of
international significance.

483
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:02,906
All the mass media
should know about it.

484
00:52:02,948 --> 00:52:08,119
I call it popular diplomacy
in action.

485
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:13,373
Even if,

486
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:15,792
I have to admit

487
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:20,254
that I'm going to miss
your gym classes terribly,

488
00:52:20,296 --> 00:52:26,050
along with your humanity.
I'm not afraid of saying it.

489
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:28,927
Shut your mouth, Vika.

490
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,929
All right.

491
00:52:38,145 --> 00:52:42,482
We've found a proper
wedding veil!

492
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:44,691
That's my bedspread.

493
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:46,110
Calm down, Vera.

494
00:52:46,151 --> 00:52:50,279
I don't want a veil.
Hats suit me better.

495
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,615
Janna, come over here.

496
00:52:56,702 --> 00:52:58,286
Roustam, help us.

497
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:16,052
One...

498
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:17,595
Two...

499
00:53:17,678 --> 00:53:18,678
Three...

500
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:30,022
What a knockout!

501
00:53:30,064 --> 00:53:32,274
Let's take a picture!

502
00:53:32,316 --> 00:53:34,776
Ali's got the camera.

503
00:53:34,818 --> 00:53:36,402
Where is he?

504
00:53:36,444 --> 00:53:38,737
He's locked himself in his room.

505
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:42,031
I knocked but he didn't answer.

506
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,418
Can I come in?

507
00:54:06,386 --> 00:54:09,680
Give us the camera, please.

508
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:11,723
There's no film left.

509
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:14,309
You want to upset me
but it won't work.

510
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,269
No, it's really all gone.

511
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:18,396
I have a gift for you.

512
00:54:28,905 --> 00:54:31,407
You mustn't leave.

513
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,700
Lucia says I mustn't
miss my chance.

514
00:54:33,743 --> 00:54:35,619
It only happens once.

515
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,705
You mustn't go.

516
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:41,290
Bye!

517
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,793
There's a war outside.

518
00:54:43,918 --> 00:54:46,086
Let go, you're hurting me.

519
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:48,588
Are you stupid or what?

520
00:55:24,953 --> 00:55:27,747
I've brought you an apple.

521
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:34,168
Eat it. That way the nurse
won't shout at you.

522
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,596
Zoia will grate it for you.

523
00:55:47,722 --> 00:55:49,765
I've got a hat.

524
00:55:51,642 --> 00:55:53,768
Andrei, sweety.

525
00:55:53,811 --> 00:55:55,270
The hat.

526
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,566
See you.

527
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,613
See you.

528
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:03,661
Last New Year, we kissed,
you remember?

529
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:08,332
This will be the second time.

530
00:57:48,742 --> 00:57:51,953
Keep the curtain closed

531
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:56,248
or the flies will crap
all over Bryan again.

532
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:01,085
Vika, be careful
when you do the bridge.

533
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:03,545
Don't go breaking your neck.

534
00:58:05,923 --> 00:58:08,883
Fedia, you're a plumber,
so fix the toilets.

535
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:13,012
There...

536
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,848
Bye.

537
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:18,934
I'm going.

538
00:58:23,355 --> 00:58:26,399
Bye.

539
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:29,610
-Where are you going?
-I'll see her to the gate.

540
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:33,321
Let's go upstairs
to watch her go.

541
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:35,823
Let's go.

542
01:00:08,152 --> 01:00:09,861
Hello.

543
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:13,697
-Hello.
-Hi.

544
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,993
Come on in,
women are always welcome.

545
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:26,959
Be careful here.

546
01:00:35,926 --> 01:00:37,760
Hello.

547
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,681
Here I am.

548
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,100
Ahmed, your fiancee's here.

549
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,310
Ahmed's marrying his beauty.

550
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,145
You were right to come.

551
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,522
Sit down at the table.

552
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,859
Next to your fiance.

553
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:05,033
Get her a clean plate.

554
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:08,411
Ahmed, why don't you
ask her to sit next to you?

555
01:01:22,257 --> 01:01:23,633
Is it true?

556
01:01:24,884 --> 01:01:26,093
What?

557
01:01:26,135 --> 01:01:27,719
You promised her?

558
01:01:27,761 --> 01:01:30,846
Yes, he did, sir, I was there.

559
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:33,099
We were all
in the laundry room.

560
01:01:34,142 --> 01:01:36,101
Say something.

561
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,276
It's tasty. All we get
is porridge and cocoa.

562
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:48,403
Ahmed, I'm waiting. Is it true?

563
01:01:49,988 --> 01:01:52,448
Yes. Why? Is that a problem?

564
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:54,033
A wedding needs wine.

565
01:01:55,785 --> 01:01:57,786
Sir, may l?

566
01:02:26,978 --> 01:02:28,979
You made a poor choice.

567
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:33,192
He's an actor.
Never trust an actor.

568
01:02:33,234 --> 01:02:35,694
I don't usually keep my word.

569
01:02:35,736 --> 01:02:38,530
But I will now!
I'm marrying her.

570
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:40,364
You're all witnesses.

571
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:41,490
Pass me the vodka.

572
01:03:26,028 --> 01:03:27,654
You know our dances?

573
01:03:27,697 --> 01:03:29,698
No, only the polka.

574
01:03:29,782 --> 01:03:32,075
Go on, you play!

575
01:04:01,725 --> 01:04:03,935
Look at this woman!
Such talent!

576
01:04:05,228 --> 01:04:07,938
Show them how you dance!

577
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:09,482
Come here! Come on!

578
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:02,235
I've come to take her back.

579
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:04,779
-ls he a relative?
-No.

580
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:06,864
His name's Ali.

581
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:09,658
He helped us out earlier.

582
01:05:09,783 --> 01:05:12,827
Come and eat with us.

583
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:17,039
Sit down.

584
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,131
Don't!

585
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,675
He never takes his pack off,
even when he sleeps.

586
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,593
What's it in? Dollars?

587
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:33,678
It's a secret. I can't say.

588
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:37,014
Why are you doing this?

589
01:05:37,056 --> 01:05:38,974
She's sick.

590
01:05:39,016 --> 01:05:43,144
I'm not sick.
I'm perfectly healthy.

591
01:05:43,187 --> 01:05:45,230
Let's go back.

592
01:05:45,272 --> 01:05:48,733
You want to take her back
to the nuthouse?

593
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:50,609
It's not a "nuthouse",

594
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:54,279
it's our home.
That's where we live.

595
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:56,781
We'll spend our lives here.

596
01:05:56,823 --> 01:05:58,824
Have a drink. We'll talk later.

597
01:05:59,784 --> 01:06:00,826
Come on!

598
01:06:10,668 --> 01:06:13,003
Leave him alone!

599
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:16,632
They're letters.

600
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:19,675
They're not letters,
they're poems.

601
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:23,012
Ali is a poet. They're poems.

602
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:33,896
Ali, don't be angry. Read
them your poems instead.

603
01:06:33,938 --> 01:06:37,274
"The storm brings darkness,
the wind howls,

604
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:39,609
"Like a beast, like a child

605
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:42,319
"lt howls at everyone

606
01:06:42,362 --> 01:06:45,447
"Twisting round tenderly

607
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,617
"Like a wanderer lost
on earth..."

608
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,419
Let's go back.

609
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:05,839
Ahmed!

610
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:12,679
Leave me alone!

611
01:07:18,893 --> 01:07:20,394
My hat!

612
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,717
Good evening,
my sweet fiancee.

613
01:08:47,468 --> 01:08:49,761
Forgive me, please.

614
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:51,930
For what?

615
01:08:51,972 --> 01:08:54,599
I can't marry you.

616
01:08:56,643 --> 01:09:00,104
He can't survive
if I abandon him.

617
01:09:00,146 --> 01:09:01,647
Who can't?

618
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:04,024
My fiance, Bryan Adams.

619
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:07,402
-He loves you that much?
-You've no idea!

620
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:08,945
It's crazy how much
he loves me!

621
01:09:08,986 --> 01:09:13,448
But that's not the reason.
It's because I love him.

622
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,741
It's tough on him.

623
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,617
He wouldn't get by
without me.

624
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,619
Is he in the army?

625
01:09:18,661 --> 01:09:20,787
No, you're in the army.

626
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:24,541
He's a singer.
He's Bryan Adams.

627
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,918
-The American star?
-He's Canadian.

628
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,754
He was born in Canada
and lives in London.

629
01:09:29,796 --> 01:09:32,381
His father's a diplomat,
he loves opera.

630
01:09:32,423 --> 01:09:34,299
Bryan Adams loves opera?

631
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:39,970
No, not Bryan,
his father loves opera.

632
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:42,848
Perhaps Bryan does too.

633
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:47,477
Do you know that we're alive

634
01:09:47,519 --> 01:09:50,062
because someone
somewhere loves us?

635
01:09:50,105 --> 01:09:54,358
They pray for us
and give us strength.

636
01:09:57,695 --> 01:10:01,489
Tell me,
who's praying for you?

637
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,407
Someone has to be.

638
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,327
Don't worry, someone has
to be praying for you too.

639
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:13,374
That's all.

640
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:27,636
You're not angry, are you?

641
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,056
I should be asking you
for forgiveness.

642
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:33,850
I never intended
to marry you.

643
01:10:33,892 --> 01:10:36,185
I was just fooling around.

644
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:38,687
I often speak before I think.

645
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:42,482
When that argument started,
I spoke out of pride.

646
01:10:42,524 --> 01:10:45,860
After, when we danced,
I saw how stupid I am.

647
01:10:47,862 --> 01:10:50,030
I'd make a poor fiance.

648
01:10:50,072 --> 01:10:54,200
But you're a great dancer!

649
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:57,871
I never thought
I'd carry a gun one day.

650
01:10:57,912 --> 01:11:02,123
I couldn't even shoot straight.

651
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:06,252
But when my brothers
were killed,

652
01:11:06,294 --> 01:11:09,004
when the roof fell in
on my father,

653
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:11,924
I went and asked them
for a gun.

654
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:14,843
So now I shoot.

655
01:11:18,638 --> 01:11:19,930
I wonder...

656
01:11:21,349 --> 01:11:23,225
when they'll kill me.

657
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:27,687
You won't get killed.
You're special.

658
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:33,609
Who do you look like,
your father or your mother?

659
01:11:33,651 --> 01:11:35,736
Who do I look like?

660
01:11:35,778 --> 01:11:38,113
Like a bald bastard,
that's who!

661
01:11:41,324 --> 01:11:44,076
-Totally fucking bald.
-So what?

662
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:48,163
Ali's bald too,
and so is the doctor.

663
01:11:48,205 --> 01:11:49,414
Lenin was too.

664
01:11:49,456 --> 01:11:50,957
And he was smart.

665
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:53,042
And his wife loved him.

666
01:11:53,084 --> 01:11:54,835
And aliens, forget it!

667
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:58,254
Not only are they bald,
they're green.

668
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:05,135
I need another drink.

669
01:12:05,178 --> 01:12:06,929
I've got some vodka.

670
01:12:06,971 --> 01:12:09,806
Fedia stole it
from the laundry.

671
01:12:17,814 --> 01:12:19,815
So you're an actor?

672
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:29,239
That's a bad idea, beautiful.

673
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:16,822
Time to fix the hangover.

674
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:19,824
I told you to eat something.

675
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:26,038
I don't remember a thing.

676
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,999
You danced
and then you cried.

677
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:31,584
After, you fell asleep
on my breast.

678
01:13:32,836 --> 01:13:34,712
Wet it with some beer.

679
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:22,127
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

680
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:24,796
I've cheated on my beloved.

681
01:14:24,838 --> 01:14:26,964
Stop it!

682
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:29,801
You can go back to him.

683
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:32,177
I won't tell him anything.

684
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:36,139
No, it's too late.

685
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:38,975
He'll never forgive me.

686
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:42,686
You and l
will be together forever now.

687
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,274
Listen, what's your name?

688
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:54,029
Janna... Timofeeva.

689
01:14:59,826 --> 01:15:03,078
Janna, don't think that way.

690
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:07,499
You understand me?

691
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:15,755
Don't panic!
Everyone pair off!

692
01:15:15,798 --> 01:15:18,925
Move to the boiler room!

693
01:15:18,968 --> 01:15:21,011
Vika, that concerns you too.

694
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:24,305
Nothing concerns me.

695
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:26,974
I don't have time
to talk to you.

696
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:30,936
Don't touch me!

697
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:38,442
What are you doing?
That's hospital property!

698
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,821
Don't forget anyone.
Stick together, in pairs!

699
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:08,926
Come in here!

700
01:16:08,968 --> 01:16:10,594
In pairs!

701
01:16:15,807 --> 01:16:17,850
The Russians are
at the market!

702
01:16:36,784 --> 01:16:40,161
Help me! Teach me to shoot!

703
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:42,788
Get out of my way!

704
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:45,457
I want to help.

705
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:48,001
Okay, give me those sacks.

706
01:16:51,755 --> 01:16:54,507
Vakhid, teach me to shoot.

707
01:16:54,549 --> 01:16:57,551
Try to understand.
I have to be with you.

708
01:16:57,593 --> 01:17:01,721
It's such a joy, fighting
for your own freedom.

709
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:04,056
I don't want to miss the party.

710
01:17:04,098 --> 01:17:07,350
-Get to the basement!
-Show me!

711
01:17:07,393 --> 01:17:11,438
It's such a joy, fighting
for your own freedom.

712
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:18,360
We're heading for the market!

713
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:29,703
Go back home!

714
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,204
You understand Russian?

715
01:17:32,498 --> 01:17:33,874
Where's my home?

716
01:17:33,874 --> 01:17:36,251
Here!

717
01:17:36,293 --> 01:17:38,711
You're totally crazy!

718
01:17:41,213 --> 01:17:44,549
I can play the accordion!

719
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:50,805
Look, I can play
the accordion!

720
01:17:50,847 --> 01:17:53,224
Faster!

721
01:17:57,519 --> 01:18:00,521
Don't stay there!

722
01:18:09,821 --> 01:18:12,615
Down with
Russian chauvinism!

723
01:18:15,284 --> 01:18:16,952
Let's go!

724
01:18:18,328 --> 01:18:19,370
Freedom!

725
01:18:19,412 --> 01:18:21,080
I love you!

726
01:18:21,122 --> 01:18:22,539
Don't stay there!

727
01:18:22,624 --> 01:18:24,709
Don't leave me!

728
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:29,337
I'm yours now, Ahmed,
I'm your wife!

729
01:18:29,379 --> 01:18:33,298
Those are not yours!

730
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,801
What are you doing?

731
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:45,684
Tell him I'm your wife!

732
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:48,270
Go, you're in the way!

733
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:50,689
I don't have a wife! Go!

734
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:02,407
Ahmed, don't kill me!

735
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:28,387
Ahmed,

736
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:30,931
I love you!

737
01:19:30,973 --> 01:19:33,350
Don't kill me!

738
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:47,820
Fire,

739
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:50,823
I love you.

740
01:19:50,823 --> 01:19:53,241
Don't kill me.

741
01:19:58,038 --> 01:19:59,414
Mud,

742
01:19:59,456 --> 01:20:01,749
I love you.

743
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,667
Don't kill me.

744
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,499
Go now, I'll stay here a while.

745
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:52,542
Go on.

746
01:21:00,424 --> 01:21:01,716
Lucia!

747
01:21:05,137 --> 01:21:07,388
Zoia!

748
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:43,877
I can't take anymore!

749
01:23:01,611 --> 01:23:03,612
What are you doing here?

750
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:10,368
Go down to the basement!

751
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:58,125
Lucia!

752
01:24:58,168 --> 01:25:00,336
Anybody!

753
01:25:09,803 --> 01:25:12,096
She's been killed
in my room!

754
01:25:12,138 --> 01:25:15,015
She has a headache.

755
01:25:18,977 --> 01:25:24,439
Listen to me,
she's lying on Lucia's bed!

756
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:19,204
You didn't eat your apple?

757
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:30,380
The nurse says that
God forgives.

758
01:27:30,422 --> 01:27:33,382
Will he forgive everyone?

759
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:35,051
Who?

760
01:27:35,093 --> 01:27:37,261
God.

761
01:27:37,303 --> 01:27:40,180
Which one?

762
01:27:43,517 --> 01:27:45,977
You know, God.

763
01:27:48,271 --> 01:27:50,606
What do you see?

764
01:27:50,648 --> 01:27:54,901
An apple.

765
01:27:54,943 --> 01:27:56,902
Is that all?

766
01:27:56,945 --> 01:28:00,489
Well, yes, what else?
It's an apple.

767
01:28:00,615 --> 01:28:04,743
I see different nations
on that apple,

768
01:28:04,785 --> 01:28:08,246
people that love each other

769
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:10,831
and destroy each other,

770
01:28:10,873 --> 01:28:13,250
fighting for generations,

771
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:17,420
and dying.

772
01:28:17,462 --> 01:28:22,591
They stare up in hope
to see my face.

773
01:28:23,843 --> 01:28:28,638
And you want me
to eat them?

774
01:28:31,933 --> 01:28:34,351
I can only forgive them.

775
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:43,275
Just as I forgive you.

776
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:47,362
I'm aware of your existence.

777
01:28:47,404 --> 01:28:49,655
Go now.

778
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:38,364
What are you doing?

779
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,949
What are you doing?

780
01:29:40,992 --> 01:29:42,993
A new hairstyle.

781
01:29:43,035 --> 01:29:45,912
It's getting in my way.

782
01:29:45,954 --> 01:29:48,539
You didn't leave?

783
01:29:48,581 --> 01:29:50,624
Well, no.

784
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:53,334
There wasn't enough room
in the truck.

785
01:29:53,377 --> 01:29:56,254
Besides, I cut my hand.

786
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,050
Where's your fiance?

787
01:30:01,092 --> 01:30:03,051
I changed my mind.

788
01:30:03,094 --> 01:30:06,596
Shorty, come here!
Janna is back!

789
01:30:09,724 --> 01:30:12,351
Doctor, where
have you been?

790
01:30:12,393 --> 01:30:14,394
I went to get some buses,

791
01:30:14,437 --> 01:30:16,897
but the Chechens
captured them,

792
01:30:16,939 --> 01:30:17,981
along with me.

793
01:30:18,023 --> 01:30:19,732
We went to Sali.

794
01:30:19,775 --> 01:30:22,610
We had no idea
where you were.

795
01:30:22,652 --> 01:30:24,445
I'm staying with you now.

796
01:30:24,487 --> 01:30:26,822
Will we have our pills again?

797
01:30:26,864 --> 01:30:28,990
Colonel, you're holding
all your pills.

798
01:30:29,032 --> 01:30:30,700
Pills again!

799
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:40,500
-Everyone upstairs!
-Let's go home!

800
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:42,877
We'll sort the mess out.

801
01:31:06,397 --> 01:31:08,273
How do you feel?

802
01:31:08,316 --> 01:31:12,444
The nurse isn't coming back?

803
01:31:12,528 --> 01:31:15,113
I don't know.

804
01:31:15,155 --> 01:31:18,157
I heard her grandson's
been killed.

805
01:31:26,623 --> 01:31:28,374
Nobody hurt you?

806
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:30,459
No.

807
01:31:30,543 --> 01:31:36,631
We sang every night,
we danced and drank beer...

808
01:31:42,845 --> 01:31:44,888
I'm glad.

809
01:31:45,931 --> 01:31:47,724
Good...

810
01:31:47,766 --> 01:31:50,226
Is he still alive?

811
01:31:50,268 --> 01:31:52,436
Who?

812
01:31:52,437 --> 01:31:55,022
Him.

813
01:31:55,064 --> 01:31:58,275
Ahmed. Is he still alive?

814
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:10,952
Let's go in.

815
01:32:13,204 --> 01:32:16,581
Let them kill him.
I want him to be killed.

816
01:32:16,624 --> 01:32:20,669
Bullet or bomb,
straight in the head.

817
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:23,213
A shell or a missile.

818
01:32:23,254 --> 01:32:26,381
I hope he's crying in pain.

819
01:32:26,424 --> 01:32:29,092
And that he forgets
about me.

820
01:32:29,134 --> 01:32:33,137
I hope he suffers a lot.

821
01:32:36,974 --> 01:32:38,516
Let's go.

822
01:33:00,828 --> 01:33:01,828
Anybody here?

823
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:03,914
Scouts, forward!

824
01:33:08,293 --> 01:33:09,710
Go in!

825
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:23,055
Where are you
dickheads off to?

826
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:26,641
You have your instructions
in black and white.

827
01:33:26,683 --> 01:33:29,435
If you see Chechen corpses,
you keep going!

828
01:33:29,519 --> 01:33:30,936
If not, watch out!

829
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:32,355
Someone's out there!

830
01:33:34,774 --> 01:33:37,442
-What is it?
-There's a guy in there.

831
01:33:42,071 --> 01:33:43,905
What's with him?

832
01:33:45,074 --> 01:33:47,451
-You read the sign?
-Yes, sir.

833
01:33:47,534 --> 01:33:50,661
We're in the nuthouse. Stop!

834
01:33:50,704 --> 01:33:53,289
It could be booby-trapped.

835
01:33:58,043 --> 01:34:00,044
-Do you get it?
-Yes, sir!

836
01:34:00,087 --> 01:34:02,130
I can't.

837
01:34:02,172 --> 01:34:03,840
I can't let anyone through.

838
01:34:03,882 --> 01:34:06,676
Get me your captain.

839
01:34:06,717 --> 01:34:08,885
What's all this shouting?

840
01:34:08,928 --> 01:34:11,096
Let my patients
use the canteen.

841
01:34:11,138 --> 01:34:14,891
No way, we haven't
checked it yet.

842
01:34:14,891 --> 01:34:18,018
Let me pass, then.
I need to get syringes.

843
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:23,023
All right, go on!

844
01:34:26,192 --> 01:34:29,820
What is this? Look at him.
He seems half-dead.

845
01:34:35,242 --> 01:34:39,537
It's nothing.
Just an adrenaline attack.

846
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:43,040
He's in shock.
He'll get over it.

847
01:34:43,082 --> 01:34:46,084
Get the picture?
Look at my boots.

848
01:34:46,084 --> 01:34:51,546
I've never seen shit like this.

849
01:34:51,589 --> 01:34:53,423
As soon as it rains,

850
01:34:53,549 --> 01:34:55,800
there's fucking mud
everywhere.

851
01:34:55,842 --> 01:34:57,885
If a tank passes, we're stuck.

852
01:34:57,928 --> 01:35:00,013
And there are mines
everywhere.

853
01:35:00,054 --> 01:35:02,305
Look at my laces.

854
01:35:02,348 --> 01:35:04,099
It's crazy!

855
01:35:04,141 --> 01:35:06,100
I can't undo them now!

856
01:35:06,101 --> 01:35:08,728
I can't take anymore!

857
01:35:21,656 --> 01:35:24,741
All Chechens should be shot.

858
01:35:29,162 --> 01:35:30,621
Where are my men?

859
01:35:30,622 --> 01:35:32,415
Where is Vaska?

860
01:35:32,499 --> 01:35:34,500
Victor's head was blown off.

861
01:35:34,542 --> 01:35:37,336
Listen,

862
01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:40,797
Serguei was shot by a sniper.

863
01:35:40,797 --> 01:35:44,967
He was such a great guy!

864
01:35:48,387 --> 01:35:52,807
Listen,

865
01:35:52,807 --> 01:35:55,434
give me a shot
of something strong.

866
01:35:55,476 --> 01:35:57,435
Just don't let my men see.

867
01:36:01,732 --> 01:36:02,983
Hold it.

868
01:36:04,734 --> 01:36:07,152
I don't get it.

869
01:36:07,153 --> 01:36:10,781
What happened to me?

870
01:36:10,823 --> 01:36:14,200
Know what
the most important thing

871
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:15,868
in the war is?

872
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:18,203
It's not victory.

873
01:36:18,246 --> 01:36:23,166
The most important thing
is Death.

874
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:28,713
I've never known fear.

875
01:36:32,466 --> 01:36:35,176
Maybe your mind
hasn't felt it,

876
01:36:35,219 --> 01:36:37,012
but your flesh has.

877
01:36:37,053 --> 01:36:40,264
Tolstoy said,

878
01:36:42,516 --> 01:36:47,478
"Why is a man happy
when he kills another?

879
01:36:49,856 --> 01:36:53,775
"What's there
to be happy about?"

880
01:36:58,196 --> 01:37:00,531
Feeling any better?

881
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:15,711
Not a fucking word
to anyone!

882
01:37:17,671 --> 01:37:19,756
Understand?

883
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:30,890
Faster!

884
01:37:30,933 --> 01:37:34,394
Right and left!

885
01:37:44,361 --> 01:37:47,572
Hey, Miss Musician,
have you seen anyone?

886
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:51,574
-What?
-There is nobody!

887
01:37:51,617 --> 01:37:54,285
Head on up.
They must be upstairs.

888
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:01,291
Nobody goes out,

889
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:05,211
unless you want to be shot!
Understood?

890
01:38:05,253 --> 01:38:06,879
Is it the war again?

891
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:09,298
We're looking for bandits!

892
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,592
They're hiding here
somewhere.

893
01:38:12,635 --> 01:38:14,177
Understand?

894
01:38:17,264 --> 01:38:19,140
Everybody hit the floor!

895
01:38:21,851 --> 01:38:24,603
-It's the war, all right!
-Get down!

896
01:38:26,188 --> 01:38:28,356
Toss in a smoke bomb!

897
01:38:37,656 --> 01:38:40,783
Surrender, you fuckers!

898
01:38:40,825 --> 01:38:43,619
Wait.

899
01:38:43,661 --> 01:38:46,746
Rekemchuk?

900
01:38:46,789 --> 01:38:48,290
Holy shit,

901
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:51,292
we're shooting
at our own side!

902
01:38:51,334 --> 01:38:54,378
Rekemchuk, are you
fucking crazy?

903
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,964
Answer me
and make it snappy!

904
01:38:58,007 --> 01:39:02,469
They shot Smirnov
on the roof.

905
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:05,221
We were firing at you...

906
01:39:05,263 --> 01:39:08,682
It's just a scratch.
Safonov is hurt.

907
01:39:08,724 --> 01:39:11,101
We'll set him straight.

908
01:39:11,143 --> 01:39:13,978
Get up there, hurry!

909
01:39:15,313 --> 01:39:17,106
Fucking move!

910
01:39:17,148 --> 01:39:18,816
Unit 2,

911
01:39:18,858 --> 01:39:22,319
send in the tanks
and surround the asylum.

912
01:39:22,361 --> 01:39:24,320
Yes,

913
01:39:24,362 --> 01:39:26,947
the one near the bridge!

914
01:39:26,989 --> 01:39:30,074
To avoid further casualties,

915
01:39:30,117 --> 01:39:33,244
put down your arms
and come out.

916
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:37,623
To avoid further casualties,

917
01:39:37,665 --> 01:39:40,542
put down your arms
and come out.

918
01:39:40,584 --> 01:39:43,336
Stay. There are
bandits upstairs.

919
01:39:43,378 --> 01:39:46,338
Lucia, I'm going with you!

920
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:48,466
Go on up!

921
01:39:51,927 --> 01:39:53,303
To avoid further casualties,

922
01:39:53,345 --> 01:39:55,304
put down your arms
and come out.

923
01:40:19,367 --> 01:40:21,785
No country treats
its people like this.

924
01:40:21,828 --> 01:40:24,038
Listen, they're firing
on the bandits.

925
01:40:26,707 --> 01:40:29,667
Is the train coming
through tonight?

926
01:40:29,709 --> 01:40:31,335
The doctor promised.

927
01:40:31,378 --> 01:40:34,338
Of course. If he promised...

928
01:40:38,717 --> 01:40:40,176
Is this place free?

929
01:40:53,104 --> 01:40:54,188
Look!

930
01:41:08,409 --> 01:41:10,368
Attention!

931
01:41:10,411 --> 01:41:13,580
Don't be afraid
of these soldiers.

932
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,039
They're kind.

933
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:18,750
They caught the bandits
on the roof.

934
01:41:18,751 --> 01:41:21,586
One of them got away.

935
01:41:21,629 --> 01:41:26,007
Did you see
anyone suspicious?

936
01:41:35,057 --> 01:41:37,100
If you do,

937
01:41:37,142 --> 01:41:41,604
Iet the guard out in the yard
know right away.

938
01:41:41,646 --> 01:41:43,731
Understand?

939
01:41:43,772 --> 01:41:46,607
We'll show you

940
01:41:46,608 --> 01:41:49,276
one of the bandits.

941
01:41:49,277 --> 01:41:51,695
He's a very bad man.

942
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:55,531
Is he one of the men
who took over the hospital,

943
01:41:55,574 --> 01:41:58,409
smashed our windows
and stole our drugs?

944
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:03,246
Bring him in!

945
01:42:04,457 --> 01:42:07,084
Well,

946
01:42:07,126 --> 01:42:10,587
who knows this man?

947
01:42:10,628 --> 01:42:12,462
He's hurt.

948
01:42:12,505 --> 01:42:13,714
What?

949
01:42:13,756 --> 01:42:15,382
What did you say?

950
01:42:17,968 --> 01:42:20,094
He's hurt.

951
01:42:23,806 --> 01:42:26,224
And so you haven't seen

952
01:42:26,267 --> 01:42:28,143
someone suspicious around?

953
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,442
Right!

954
01:42:40,195 --> 01:42:41,737
Petrov, hold on.

955
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,865
Take the prisoner to HQ!

956
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:46,867
We'll soon see.

957
01:42:48,494 --> 01:42:51,371
The building's clean,
as they say.

958
01:42:51,413 --> 01:42:54,498
Any problems, call HQ.

959
01:43:04,841 --> 01:43:06,634
Who's that?

960
01:43:12,848 --> 01:43:14,307
Who are you?

961
01:43:24,608 --> 01:43:28,819
I'm sick, I need to be treated.

962
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:33,865
Do you all know him?

963
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:37,369
He's one of us, he's Ahmed.

964
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,581
Right! He's our Ahmed!

965
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:46,209
He's in our room.
