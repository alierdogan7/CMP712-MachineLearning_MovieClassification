1
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,038
I think it might be useful to clarify
a few things right off the bat.

2
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,280
By simple definition,
we are in the business of winning wars.

3
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,278
What else do you need an army for?

4
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,836
Take the Cold War,
we won without firing a single shot.

5
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,668
Why? Number one,
we just flat out out-spent them.

6
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,269
The Russians couldn't shovel money
into the fire as fast as we could.

7
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,949
Number two, and this is where
my command comes in,

8
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,195
technology.

9
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,993
Nobody shapes nature the way we do.

10
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,833
We take atoms and molecules
and make them into everything

11
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,871
from combat boots to bombs.

12
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,309
Bombs the other side will never see

13
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,717
until they're ploughing down their
chimney like Santa Claus from hell!

14
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,955
General?

15
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,951
What?

16
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,913
This is not the first time
you've been here.

17
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,316
We've been down this road before,
that is correct.

18
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,874
Several times, in fact.

19
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,434
I haven't been keeping count.

20
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,235
Let me refresh your memory.
You have before you a document.

21
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,430
I do.

22
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,670
The sensor fused anti-tank missile.

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,193
I'll be the first to admit that this programme
had its share of difficulties.

24
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,791
We did experience a glitch or two
with the thing, that much is certain.

25
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,470
But even a heat-seeking missile
can miss a target.

26
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,355
General, I see here
that you taped electric hotplates

27
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,669
to the surface of the vehicle to help
your heat-seeking missile find its target

28
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,792
and that the temperature
of the vehicle was so high

29
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,957
that it could have fried an egg at 20 feet!

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,718
Commence fire!

31
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,271
There was a verifiable deviation
of the standard test data accumulation.

32
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,198
There were other deviations,
were there not?

33
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,231
What about the Paveway bomb?

34
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,312
I'm not going to tell you
the Paveway never missed.

35
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:05,118
It missed by a mean distance
of five miles and nearly 50% of the time.

36
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,196
You know...

37
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,836
in baseball, a guy who hits.400
is considered pretty damn great.

38
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,271
In baseball the losing team
isn't killed by their opponents.

39
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
Be that as it may,
the Paveway is one hell of a bomb.

40
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,558
Laser-guided, state-of-the-art.

41
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,388
And it proved what?
That we have an effective weapon

42
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,228
as long as the enemy allows us
to build a two-storey crane

43
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,271
directly above their tanks?

44
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,670
We have had some spectacular successes.

45
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,553
- Such as?
- That's classified information.

46
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,673
General...
Let's move on to the next item.

47
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,790
The Bradley fighting vehicle.

48
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,791
What would you say the batting average is
for the Bradley, General?

49
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,235
It takes people with sophisticated knowledge
and expertise

50
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,432
to conduct these tests
and to interpret the results.

51
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,471
If the US Army acted on the advice

52
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,432
of every Tom, Dick and Harry
who had an opinion,

53
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,473
we'd wind up with a bunch of B-52s
powered by outboard motors.

54
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,512
- I fail to see your point.
- My point is...

55
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,872
that a lot of things have to come together
to create a new weapon,

56
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,957
and it takes teamwork.

57
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,718
Good, old-fashioned teamwork.

58
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,711
Colonel James Burton -
was he part of your team, General?

59
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,751
More or less.

60
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,992
Post, sir?

61
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,233
Sergeant.

62
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,319
Can you tell me how to get to 4E-624?

63
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,830
Forward into the escalator,
your left, two flights up to four,

64
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,351
your left, E-ring, your right,
proceed past corridor nine, face left.

65
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,598
Thank you.

66
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,795
It's no secret that
Colonel Burton had a rocky tenure,

67
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,479
that we didn't see eye-to-eye.

68
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,910
But it didn't start out that way.

69
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,353
No, no, no, no, no!

70
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,356
I spoke to General Hall.

71
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,118
General Hall spoke to General Jones...

72
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,720
...General Jones spoke to Admiral Watts.

73
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,274
Well, then, write it down!

74
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,872
That takes care of Spina in Rhode Island,
and Mays from Nebraska. Any Democrats?

75
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,353
No, forget him.

76
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,636
Because he's a scum-sucking Judas
who'd sell his mother for a handful of votes.

77
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,035
How about the Senate?

78
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,993
That son of a bitch.
After we papered his state with contracts.

79
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,955
All right, let's make the fuselage in Michigan
and the landing gear in Mississippi.

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,471
By all means, let's keep Congressman Groves
and his bloodsucking buddies happy.

81
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,070
- Welcome, Colonel.
- Thank you, General.

82
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,910
- You and I ought to get to know one another.
- I welcome the opportunity, sir.

83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,997
- Fact is, I'd like to help you.
- Thank you, sir.

84
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,398
Your new job, under certain circumstances,
can turn into a real shit-burnin' detail.

85
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,069
You're gonna need friends.
I'd like you to count me as one.

86
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,076
I appreciate that, sir.

87
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,758
Air Force Academy,

88
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,112
Strategic Air Command,
MBA from Auburn.

89
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,918
Your commanding officer,
General De Grasso and I, are old friends.

90
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,758
He says for you the sky is the limit.

91
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,516
But then you draw the short straw.

92
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,630
I was assigned, sir.

93
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,114
Hell, it's a bum deal, whoever made it.

94
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,153
Every other year, somebody decides
we're spending too much money.

95
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,035
A bunch of pencil-necks get together
and come up with a plan.

96
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,277
This year, it's the joint
live-fire test programme.

97
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,470
Staffed from all the services.

98
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,910
So now we got the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marines,

99
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,599
doing a circle-jerk over weapons testing,

100
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,473
and you get to hold the big dick.

101
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,592
I mean, who thinks up this nonsense?

102
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,751
Congress, sir?

103
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,316
And so it should, that's its job.
You'll never hear me criticise the Hill.

104
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,956
You'd think Congress has enough
of their own shit without wanting ours.

105
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,390
Well, I'm not anticipating any problems, sir.

106
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,078
Neither am I.

107
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,715
A man as clever as you
knows how to walk a minefield.

108
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,159
Howard Matheson.

109
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,159
Came here two rotations ago.
That marlin isn't all he caught.

110
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,671
I got him into SenCom and now
he's head of their missile testing.

111
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,917
- Blake Gelmore, you know Blake?
- No, sir.

112
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,953
Wasn't even a full-bird colonel
when he left for the private sector.

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,150
That was four years ago.

114
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,237
A few contracts later and look at him...

115
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,397
He could buy and sell both of us
a thousand times over.

116
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,431
- Lucky man.
- Smart man.

117
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,190
First-rate soldier, just like you. Knew
how to make the best of a difficult situation.

118
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,711
This new job of yours is tough.
It's going to require teamwork.

119
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,957
These are a couple of your projects
undergoing testing.

120
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,437
The UH-60 helicopter,
the AV-8B jump-jet

121
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,438
and the Bradley fighting vehicle.

122
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,040
All outstanding programmes,
all organised and ready to go.

123
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,071
I did a little homework for you.

124
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,031
I appreciate that, General.

125
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,790
You could return the favour by giving
the Bradley a little extra attention.

126
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,512
Attention?

127
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,916
We need it in the field.
The sooner the better.

128
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,952
Put it on top of all the things
in your inbox

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,072
so it'll get in your outbox
as soon as possible.

130
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,475
As a personal favour to me.

131
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,317
- Best of luck, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

132
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,320
- Colonel.
- Sir?

133
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,433
Next time you're told
to report to this office, be on time.

134
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,437
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,713
Sir.

136
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,389
Colonel James Burton,
I'm here to see the Bradley test.

137
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,715
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Thank you.

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,719
- There he is.
- That's the guy?

139
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,876
That's him, supposed to be real smart.

140
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,876
Squadron Officer School,

141
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,833
- Air Command and Staff College.
- First tour with the Pentagon?

142
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,475
He was at the Air Force lab
when Congress called.

143
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,795
He's a soldier, not just a manager.

144
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,799
- What do you mean?
- He's put in his fair share of flying time.

145
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,876
Looks like a fucking choirboy.

146
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,708
Maybe, but nothing goes into production
until he signs off.

147
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,549
Target is now in position...

148
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,913
Colonel Burton, JD Bach.
Welcome to the team. Ha-ha-ha!

149
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,155
- Colonel Bach.
- Good to see you.

150
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,149
This is Major Sayers, our chief tester.
Army Weapons Research Lab.

151
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,159
So how'd an Air Force guy end up
overseeing tests run by the Army?

152
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,919
- It could have been worse.
- How's that?

153
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,390
Congress could have appointed
someone from the Navy.

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,152
The range is now hot.
The range is now hot.

155
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,671
Commencing armour penetration tests
on the Bradley fighting vehicle.

156
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,155
Attention on the firing line.
Attention on the firing line.

157
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,997
Are you ready on the right?

158
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,357
Ready on the left?

159
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,994
Firing line is ready.

160
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,554
Firing detail, commence firing.

161
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,955
Cease fire. Cease fire.

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,675
- Ha-ha! Damn impressive armour.
- Congratulations.

163
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,191
All right, drinks are on me, gentlemen.
Joining us, Colonel Burton?

164
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,993
Congratulations, thanks for your help.

165
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,077
We couldn't have done it without you. Thanks.

166
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,069
- Say, Colonel, are you gonna join us?
- Well...

167
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,111
Shouldn't we take a closer look?

168
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,594
No, actually, safety precautions.

169
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,835
See, the fire team goes out first,

170
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,350
no one else is allowed near the vehicle
for another hour.

171
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,597
- Why is that?
- Any test involving a live round,

172
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,837
there's a freak chance
that something might blow.

173
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,350
We don't wanna lose you
first day on the job, Colonel.

174
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,756
- How about that drink?
- Sounds good, Major.

175
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,151
There'll be a phone call for you in your office
at 1100 hours. It's important you be there.

176
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,954
- Good morning.
- Welcome, sir.

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,959
- Welcome, sir.
- Morning.

178
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,073
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, sir.

179
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,954
- I unpacked a few of your things.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,911
- Family, sir?
- What's that?

181
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,838
- Family.
- Oh, that's my uncle.

182
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,679
- He was a flier in World War II.
- Hm.

183
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,118
Huh!

184
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,314
- What's that?
- The plane I learned to fly in, a T-28.

185
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,272
I used to take her up, slide the canopy back,

186
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,989
and fly for hours.

187
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,031
Just me and the sky.

188
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,676
Personally, I like the sky where it is -
with me on the ground looking up at it.

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,434
So, where you from, sir?

190
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,152
Just outside of Chicago.

191
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,317
Hm. And where would that be?

192
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,429
Normal.

193
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,678
Normal, Illinois, is that on the map?

194
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,796
Yes, Sergeant, it is.

195
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,554
Is it normal in Normal?

196
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,070
I think the word is uneventful.

197
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,234
You getting paid by the hour, Colonel?

198
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,556
No, I got an appointment.

199
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,079
I'II, um... take this, Sergeant, thank you.

200
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,279
Fine.

201
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,838
Mm-hm.

202
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,191
Colonel Burton.

203
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,074
Hello?

204
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,589
The test on the Bradley,
I hear you wanted a closer look.

205
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,437
How did you hear that?

206
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,314
When it comes to the Bradley,
follow your instincts, Colonel.

207
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,477
- Who is this?
- I can't tell you that right now.

208
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,753
Well, whoever you are, I don't take
unsolicited advice from people I don't know.

209
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,917
Just make sure you read
the fine print, Colonel.

210
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,836
Sir, Colonel Burton. Sir.

211
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,673
You're up early, sir.

212
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,555
I'm on my way to the office, Sergeant.
Thought I'd check out the Bradley.

213
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,593
Sir, isn't your office 40 miles that way, sir?

214
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,511
Yes, Sergeant, yes, it is.

215
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,230
Has anything been altered
on this vehicle since the test?

216
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,679
No, sir.

217
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,109
Are you looking for something, sir?

218
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,358
Just reading the fine print, Sergeant.
Just reading the fine print.

219
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,512
Stinger missiles, 50 cal tracers.

220
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,755
7.62 tracers.

221
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,916
25mm rounds.

222
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,270
- What's this?
- That was used on the Bradley, sir.

223
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,592
This writing, it's Romanian, isn't it?

224
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,792
Yes, sir, it is.

225
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,037
Sir, Colonel Bach and Major Sayers
won't be here until noon.

226
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,719
That's when our first test is scheduled, sir.

227
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,118
This isn't exactly an all-out test, Sergeant.
More like a little pop quiz.

228
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,551
I'm not sure regulations allow us to borrow
the door from the ammunition shed

229
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,955
for a pop quiz, sir.

230
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,233
Sir, regulations state that the ammunition shed
should never be left open, sir.

231
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,077
Duly noted, Sergeant.

232
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,635
Regulations also apply
to removing the door, Colonel.

233
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,272
Also duly noted.

234
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,317
Fire when ready.

235
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,116
Backblast area clear! On the way, sir.

236
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,309
Fire.

237
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,309
Come on straight... Hold!

238
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,798
You wrecked a door?

239
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,875
Colonel, the ammunition
used on the test on the Bradley

240
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,115
is the same as we used on this door.

241
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,789
Romanian - the most ineffective
ammunition in the world.

242
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,037
- No wonder the Bradley passed.
- This is serious.

243
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,469
- It is!
- Yes, you destroyed a door.

244
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,830
It was tested on
an armoured personnel carrier,

245
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,440
a vehicle to carry soldiers into combat.

246
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,870
This door is property of
the United States government.

247
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,480
The shell barely penetrated the door.

248
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,796
OK, but it's all bent.
How are you gonna put it back?

249
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,070
I'm not really worried about that!

250
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,477
- This door protects our ammunition.
- The ammunition doesn't work!

251
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,432
But we need the ammunition for our tests.

252
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,712
Look - I'll buy the Army
a new goddamn door.

253
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,719
You can't afford a door like that.
Did you see what it stood up to?

254
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,036
Exactly! Some spitball from Romania!

255
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,631
It was my understanding that only Soviet arms
would be used in these tests.

256
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,959
Well, yes, and Romania
is one of the Soviet blocs...

257
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,951
- Isn't it?
- Colonel Burton,

258
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,798
we've been testing
the Bradley for some time.

259
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,752
You may not be aware
of some steps we've taken.

260
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,271
The Romanian rocket is only 73mm.
That's less than the 85mm Russian.

261
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,836
A smaller diameter means
a smaller explosion and less shrapnel.

262
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,158
We're conducting tests
using ammunition of varying diameters

263
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,159
to determine the exact threshold
of the Bradley's tolerance.

264
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,069
So far it's held up against everything
we've thrown at it, sir - Soviet, Romanian.

265
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,951
Latvian, Lithuanian...

266
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,355
Like a rock.

267
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,999
My apologies.

268
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,315
You're new to the project.

269
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,351
There's a lot to catch up on.

270
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,599
You're right. So if you'll get me
the test reports, I can catch right up.

271
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,234
- How's that, Colonel?
- Send me the data,

272
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,840
I'll do my homework,
and we can push through.

273
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,633
We've got five years of test reports, sir.

274
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,399
- We have a schedule.
- Let's keep to it,

275
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,115
get the Bradley into production, ASAP,
what do you say?

276
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,111
Thank you, gentlemen.

277
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,595
This could blow the whole deal.

278
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,871
You've got to stop this
like you did with the last guy.

279
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,549
- Don't worry about it.
- Sir, he wants to see the reports.

280
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,036
- Just give him the reports.
- Are you out of your mind?

281
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,913
Now listen to me. Listen very carefully.

282
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,516
Give him everything he wants.

283
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,710
Every single piece of paper.

284
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,478
Everything.

285
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,479
- Sergeant?
- Here, sir.

286
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,672
What the heck is all this?

287
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,951
Everything you ever wanted to know about
the Bradley and weren't afraid to ask.

288
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,560
Every memo on every last nut and bolt.

289
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,870
I wonder which national forest
died for this project.

290
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,914
- You read any of this stuff?
- I hoped you'd have the Cliff Notes.

291
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,397
- I hardly know where to start.
- Maybe that's the whole idea.

292
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,951
I don't get it.
What?

293
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,875
- That.
- It's the Bradley.

294
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,959
Well, if that's the Bradley, then what's this?

295
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,673
- What's the date?
- 1968.

296
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,199
The question is, how did they get to that...

297
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,071
from this?

298
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,549
Gentlemen, our mission
was to design and implement

299
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,878
an infantry transport vehicle
that would be a worthy replacement

300
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,753
for the M-113 armoured personnel carrier.

301
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,633
We have met that objective and then some.

302
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,274
The Bradley armoured personnel carrier

303
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,438
will bring troops to a combat zone
swiftly, efficiently, and safely.

304
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,711
It will hold 11 men plus a driver,

305
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,148
and features a 20mm cannon,

306
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,829
which will provide
ample firepower and flexibility.

307
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,957
Lightly armoured, speedy
and solidly engineered,

308
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,437
our troops will arrive at the battlefield
in the finest American technology.

309
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,756
And at a million and a half per,
a real bargain.

310
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,358
Nice work, Colonel!

311
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,799
Outstanding!

312
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,671
Damn impressive!

313
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,555
So it was a big taxicab - drive guys
to the battlefield and go back home.

314
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,591
Mm-hm.

315
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,674
But how did it
end up with a turret on top?

316
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,519
Hm. Hm-hm-hm.

317
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,869
- This is all well and good...
- Something wrong, General?

318
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,118
There won't be anything left in the budget
for my scout.

319
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,559
I doubt it, Bob.

320
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,479
You don't need scouts -
you have radar, air-recon, satellites.

321
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,230
You always need a scout -
why couldn't this thing serve as a scout?

322
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,430
But it's a troop carrier, General.

323
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,869
This is a speedy vehicle. Why can't it be both?

324
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,876
For one thing, it's too big.

325
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,992
And you can't really see out much from inside.

326
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,589
- Sounds like a design flaw to me.
- Design flaw? No...

327
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,679
We'll just stick a turret on top
with lots of opticals.

328
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,518
But then, sir, it'll be even bigger.

329
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,597
What's your problem, Smith?
Not elegant enough for you?

330
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,514
The thing is, it's hard to do a "sneak
and peek" when you're over ten feet tall.

331
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,552
- He's got a point, Bob.
- We need a scout.

332
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,194
This is fast enough and it's funded.

333
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,392
- Actually, we're a hair over budget.
- Turn the Bradley into a scout

334
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,797
and we're gonna be selling them off
to some el presidente in no time!

335
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,719
Anything for surveillance
ends up south of the border.

336
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,070
That anti-aircraft gun,
who backed you up on that?

337
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,113
- You did, Bob.
- Who testified to Appropriations?

338
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,835
- You did, Bob.
- I'm talking to Appropriations next week.

339
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,713
Do I sell you on my scout or do I not?

340
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,955
You did, Bob.

341
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,389
How about portholes along the side?

342
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,399
So the fellas can stick out their guns
and shoot people!

343
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,749
Good. And you know what, Colonel?

344
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,078
We already have the turret.
We oughta get the biggest bang we can.

345
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,838
I'm sorry - bang, sir?

346
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,917
You can't hurt anybody
with that pansy-ass gun!

347
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,554
Add on some firepower!

348
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,109
- Where do I fit the extra ammo?
- I don't know. Shift things around.

349
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,153
4400 rounds of machine gun ammo,
and you wanna add 25mm shells?

350
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,478
- The General wants his ammo.
- He can't have it unless he carries it.

351
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,511
- Can you squeeze it in?
- No.

352
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,676
Just squeeze it in!

353
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,393
We're not trying on Levi's here, Colonel.

354
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,193
Are you telling me that in a vehicle this size,

355
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,038
you can't fit a few rounds of ammunition?

356
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,799
Not in its current configuration, no, sir.

357
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,436
So, the configuration is wrong.
There must be something you can dump.

358
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,756
- Dump, sir?
- Something you don't need.

359
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,360
General, the interior is very spare.

360
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,278
Besides the ammunition and the men...

361
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,199
Leave one of the fellas behind.
Put the ammo where the men go.

362
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,877
Sir...

363
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,991
it is a troop carrier.

364
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,714
So, make a couple of extra trips,
what's the difference?

365
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,237
They want a transport
that doesn't carry men,

366
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,272
and a scout that's got a cannon
as big as a tank's.

367
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,834
- And portholes.
- Great, portholes!

368
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,350
To shoot at whatever
they can't hit with their cannon.

369
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,914
You don't have to buy it, just draw it.

370
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,435
- That's one hell of a cannon.
- That's the problem.

371
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,879
Why?

372
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,471
You go out on a battlefield
with this pecker sticking out of your turret,

373
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,910
and the enemy is gonna
unload on you with all they got.

374
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,714
But it's a troop carrier, not a tank.

375
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,671
You want me to put a sign on it -

376
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,110
"I am a troop carrier, not a tank,
please don't shoot"?

377
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,915
This was going to be so beautiful.

378
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,628
- Good work, Smith.
- Looks perfect.

379
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,716
- Thank you, sir.
- The thing is...

380
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,159
Yes, General?

381
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,796
Looks a little like a tank with that cannon.
Probably gonna draw more fire.

382
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,638
Actually, sir, that has come to our attention.

383
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,355
We know it's not a tank,
but will the other side?

384
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,278
I guess we could always thicken the armour.

385
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,068
Colonel Smith, could you explain
why you put those portholes there?

386
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,478
Yes, sir, as per your request,
so the men can shoot out at the enemy.

387
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,548
- You're joking, aren't you?
- Portholes? Are we in the navy?

388
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,034
Say... you think you could
make this thing amphibious?

389
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,196
Get the troops across a river?

390
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,639
No.

391
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,636
No, sir. No.

392
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,591
No, no, no, no, no.

393
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,632
Amphibious?
The Bradley's supposed to swim?

394
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,551
In theory, at least.

395
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,070
Amphibious troop carrier slash scout...

396
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,519
Slash tank.

397
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,279
A couple more months,
I bet this thing can fly.

398
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,595
What's this in the margin?

399
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,631
"Please help me,

400
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,114
"I am losing my mind,

401
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,036
"RLS."

402
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,556
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laurel Smith,
head of oversight and development.

403
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,115
Aluminium.

404
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,879
- This thing's got an aluminium skin.
- Huh?

405
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,112
Anything fired at it will go through it
like a hot knife through butter.

406
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,118
We're using steel rather than aluminium.

407
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,596
Of course, steel is
much heavier than aluminium,

408
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,835
so it won't go as fast.

409
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
We can't lose speed -
it won't work as a scout.

410
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,275
It won't keep pace with tanks, either.

411
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,756
Armour's a reactive measure.
Let's think proactive.

412
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,109
Equip it with anti-tank missiles,

413
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,789
then it can blast those enemy tanks
before they fire.

414
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,831
What do you think, Colonel?

415
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,199
Fine.

416
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,274
- Anti-tank missiles?
- I don't know.

417
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,278
The men will have to wear
the missiles as hats!

418
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,676
I don't know, Jones.
That's why you get paid big bucks.

419
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,794
- Colonel, we're not talking about...
- A pair of Levi's. I know!

420
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,195
God damn it!

421
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,835
We are talking about 11 years
with nothing to show for it!

422
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,350
Except an ulcer the size
of the district of Columbia

423
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,436
and a career on permanent hold!

424
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,833
You see this?

425
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,271
I've been... I've been a bird colonel so long,
I swear I'm growing feathers!

426
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,472
If you have to design hats to haul
those goddamn missiles, then just do it.

427
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,631
Excuse me, sir...

428
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,876
Uh... ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention, please.

429
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,796
If you'd all just take your seats.

430
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,717
Thank you.

431
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,836
We are pleased to present a scale model

432
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,430
of the new Bradley fighting vehicle.

433
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,315
Featuring scout, troop transport,
and anti-tank capabilities,

434
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,875
it carries six men.

435
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,115
How many was it supposed to carry?

436
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,469
- 11.
- The Bradley is outfitted

437
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,956
with sophisticated surveillance equipment.

438
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,996
It is also equipped with a rapid-fire cannon,
and an anti-tank rocket launcher.

439
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,190
Which means it's loaded with...

440
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,677
1500 shells and ten TOW anti-tank missiles.

441
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,918
So in summation, gentlemen,
what you have before you is...

442
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,635
A troop transport that can't carry troops,

443
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,673
a reconnaissance vehicle that's
too conspicuous to do reconnaissance...

444
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,713
And a quasi-tank that has
less armour than a snow-blower

445
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,752
but has enough ammo to take out half of DC.

446
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,112
- Fantastic.
- Congratulations, General Smith.

447
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,196
- General?
- Helluva job.

448
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,151
General?

449
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,031
Let's build it.

450
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,711
They're building it?

451
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,433
This is what we're building?

452
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,639
Please be seated.

453
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,752
This will be brief,
I'm needed at the Oval Office.

454
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,872
I want to show you
this morning's New York Times.

455
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,515
If you'd be so kind to turn
to the editorial page.

456
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,633
It essentially says that every weapon
we produce is overpriced junk.

457
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,195
Now, that's not news.
Critics have said it for years.

458
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,310
What was news to me

459
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,672
touched on our supposedly spectacular
"Sergeant York" anti-aircraft gun.

460
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,669
It says there when the Sergeant York
proved incapable of hitting airplanes,

461
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,871
we test-fired it at hovering helicopters.

462
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,639
When it failed to hit hovering helicopters,

463
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,877
we fired at stationary targets
and it missed those.

464
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,071
Now is this possible, General Keane?

465
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,998
There was a problem with the proximity fusing.

466
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,795
According to this, one missile locked
on to a ventilation fan in the latrine!

467
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,675
And destroyed the latrine.
Were we test-firing at latrines that day?

468
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,510
My first sergeant was in that latrine
and he's around to swear otherwise.

469
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,677
Why am I learning about this
in the newspaper?

470
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,599
It makes me look foolish,
and I am not a foolish man.

471
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,713
General Cushing, any problems
with the Maverick missile tests?

472
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,159
No, sir.

473
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,634
Admiral Morehouse, any problems?

474
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,752
- None whatsoever, sir.
- General Partridge...

475
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,836
- Sir!
- Problems with the Bradley?

476
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,235
No, sir, absolutely not.

477
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,271
Production is imminent.

478
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,079
Mr Secretary, I believe
the press is on a wild-goose chase,

479
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,998
looking for problems where none exist.

480
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,114
Let's hope you're right, General.
Because we do have problems.

481
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,233
Terrorists in Lebanon,
and Colonel Qadhafi in Libya,

482
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,669
and Sandinistas in Nicaragua,

483
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,030
and let's not forget our ongoing problems
with the Soviet Union.

484
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,717
Frankly, I don't appreciate calls
from reporters and congressmen

485
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,038
asking me why nothing
we are working on works,

486
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,993
and I can't answer them because
the men developing these systems

487
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,235
tell me everything is just peachy!

488
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,196
So, if you don't have problems, good.

489
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,276
If you do, get rid of them.

490
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,871
I want these weapons built.
If not by you, I'll find men who can.

491
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,152
You wanted to see me, sir?

492
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,713
Yes, I do.

493
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,751
Close the damn door, come on.

494
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,033
About these tests you've been
thinking about conducting on the Bradley.

495
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,071
I understand your concern,

496
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,318
but if you were an armoured warfare expert
instead of a flier,

497
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,796
you'd understand
the Bradley is a good vehicle.

498
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,833
4,000 Americans will be employed building it,
the Army wants it.

499
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,997
- Read the files...
- I've read the files, sir.

500
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,913
200 pages on the rear door,

501
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,273
250 pages on the paint job,
computer simulations of combat -

502
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,677
not a single test that indicates what
might happen if the Bradley takes a hit.

503
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,909
Which is why I've ordered
a full-up live fire test.

504
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,228
I want to equip a Bradley with
all the ammunition it would take into battle,

505
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,637
fill all the fuel tanks, and hit it
with a Soviet anti-tank weapon,

506
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,752
- to see how it'll hold up.
- Cancel it.

507
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,789
Sir?

508
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,116
I think we're having
a communication meltdown.

509
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,711
Whatever problems there are, we'll fix them -
in the field, after they're deployed.

510
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,991
- General...
- That's the way we're gonna do this.

511
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,917
Nobody takes your job
more seriously than I do,

512
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,270
but I also have a job -
to deploy that Bradley.

513
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,995
I want that rocket launcher
pointed at the Soviets.

514
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,238
Here.

515
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,952
Jesus.

516
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,718
Dismissed.

517
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,597
- Afternoon. Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

518
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,555
- Fanning!
- Yes, sir?

519
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,632
- What happened to you?
- Don't ask. What's this?

520
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,717
It was on your desk
when I got back from lunch.

521
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,799
Some ammunition for your Bradley battle.

522
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,479
Hm!

523
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,351
It's a British Army test report.

524
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,075
Top secret too.

525
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,111
Until it landed here.

526
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,638
General Smith, Jim Burton.

527
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,109
How did you find me?

528
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,596
You have very distinctive handwriting.

529
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,791
I've been reading memos on the Bradley
going back to 1968,

530
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,997
with your handwritten notes in the margin,
or... initialled by you.

531
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,835
- This handwriting?
- We should not be seen talking.

532
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,594
Look, you contacted me, General.

533
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,713
No. You received an anonymous leak
about which I know nothing.

534
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,675
The British found out that aluminium
gives off a toxic gas when hit by a shell.

535
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,190
Bad news for men
in aluminium armoured vehicles.

536
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,153
Couldn't we... couldn't we sit down
somewhere and actually talk?

537
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,996
If the Pentagon had their choice
of busting us or nailing a Soviet spy,

538
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,395
they would choose us in a heartbeat.

539
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,671
Who exactly is "us", General?

540
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,759
Some people who work in the Pentagon
are fed up watching billions of dollars

541
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,191
thrown away on defective weapons
upon which our troops stake their lives.

542
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,392
People like you, Colonel.
We are the enemy.

543
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,398
- To whom?
- To majors who want to be colonels,

544
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,479
colonels who want to be generals,
you bet we are the enemy.

545
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,750
To move up, you have to get things done.

546
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,598
You don't want to be the one
who drops the ball,

547
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,791
cos if you drop the ball,
no promotion, no star,

548
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,150
no cushy job with a contractor
when you retire.

549
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,672
Which is why, Colonel, everyone
attached to the Bradley will stop your tests.

550
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,113
General, I appreciate your interests
if not your methods.

551
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,869
Whatever disagreements
I may be having over the Bradley

552
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,753
will be resolved above board.

553
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,399
Now, if you have something to say,

554
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,115
I'm sure the Washington Post
would love to talk to you.

555
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,711
Me? The press? Are you crazy?
The Army is my life.

556
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,038
Like you, I work inside the system, and
you don't have a prayer of running your tests,

557
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,913
not unless you're willing
to sacrifice your career.

558
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,112
And if you think you're safe because
Congress gave you your job, think again.

559
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,355
Good day, Colonel. And good luck.

560
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,510
So why did you send me that report?

561
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,559
Sir.

562
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,348
- Nice to see you, General.
- Good to see you.

563
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,875
- Evening, sir.
- Evening, sir.

564
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,479
So she whispered to me, "Why do you think
the General always stands at attention?"

565
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,239
- Sir, Major Sayers is in the library.
- Tell Major Sayers I'm busy.

566
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,636
He said the little prick
ordered tests on the Bradley.

567
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,752
What? I'll have his ass in a sling so fast.

568
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,236
Whose ass, sir? Major Sayers
or the little prick?

569
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,431
General, he knows about
the study the Brits did.

570
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,550
- What study?
- On aluminium.

571
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,830
Aluminium's used on the Bradley, sir.

572
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,917
When hit by a shell, it burns
and gives off a toxic gas.

573
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,109
God damn it.

574
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,392
We fought a revolution
so we could ignore the fucking British!

575
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,237
So why mess things up now?

576
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,840
- I thought you talked to him.
- I did.

577
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,678
- The man must be a fool.
- Can't you stop him, sir?

578
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,109
No, I'm not his commanding officer.

579
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,029
Some draft-dodging junior congressman
wanted more objectivity in the testing process.

580
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,071
Goddamn checks and balances.

581
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,749
General, with all due respect,
this isn't just a check, sir,

582
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,870
it's a full fucking body block!

583
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,835
If we don't get the Bradley out there now,
it'll be stuck in development forever.

584
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,229
Start production now.

585
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,875
Throw Burton a bone or two.
Let him run a couple of tests.

586
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,356
Yes, sir. General, actually,
he'd like to blow it up.

587
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,755
I don't give a fuck what Burton wants.

588
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,998
Let him do some piddly-shit stuff,
see if he can parallel park the fucker!

589
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,031
Just get it into production.

590
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,358
Am I to understand
that you were not in favour

591
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,834
of the tests Colonel Burton proposed?

592
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,677
Absolutely not.

593
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,992
Absolutely not, yes,
or absolutely not, no?

594
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,156
Absolutely not absolutely.

595
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,237
Are you questioning
his motives or his methods?

596
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,989
I have no reason to question
Colonel Burton's motives.

597
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,270
I can only speak to his methods.

598
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,394
Which, by anyone's definition
were somewhat peculiar.

599
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,395
There were other ways to find out

600
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,672
if clothing would catch fire
inside the Bradley when it took a hit.

601
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,156
Let's take the... the mannequin thing.

602
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,430
- Colonel.
- Yes?

603
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,189
- Phone call, sir. They said it's important.
- Very good.

604
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,310
- Dalton.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,750
- I'll meet you back at the firing area.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,079
- Strip the dummies.
- Sir?

607
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,313
Strip the dummies, Sergeant, now.

608
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,954
Thank you. Let's go.

609
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,798
Fire when ready.

610
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,115
Backblast area clear!

611
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,720
- Out of the way, sir.
- Fire.

612
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,109
Hold it there. Let me see those.

613
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,472
Uh-huh. That looks good,
uniforms look good. Great, there you go.

614
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,112
Wait a minute, what's that?

615
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,276
That's part of our test, Colonel.

616
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,672
Wait a minute.

617
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,195
No one in my command
gave the order to strip the dummies

618
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,312
and put their clothes
inside a fireproof container

619
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,796
inside the vehicle while
Colonel Burton wasn't around.

620
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,354
You're a pair of clowns!

621
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,830
The insults that were traded that day

622
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,792
had no business
showing up in the test reports.

623
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,718
They were deleted from the final report.

624
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,471
All except Colonel Bach's unfortunate
reference to Colonel Burton's mother.

625
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,115
Temperatures were running high.

626
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,879
Apparently inside the Bradley as well.

627
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,869
There's a degree of uncertainty
involved in every test.

628
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,668
That's the point of doing tests -
to find out what happens.

629
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,115
If we knew what the results would be,
we wouldn't need to do the test.

630
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,756
And just because the tests
didn't always come out

631
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,155
the way Colonel Burton expected...

632
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,876
is no reason to assume that
anything devious was going on.

633
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,709
I ask you, General,
filling the fuel tanks with water

634
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,991
for a test designed
to check the combustibility

635
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,669
of those tanks - that wasn't devious?

636
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,677
If the tanks had been filled with fuel

637
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,429
there's a good chance
the vehicle would have exploded.

638
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,710
Isn't that the point?

639
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,192
If the vehicle had exploded,
we couldn't run additional tests.

640
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,710
I can't order up an unlimited number
of Bradleys just to blow them up!

641
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,353
Unless you're telling me
to spend more money.

642
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,520
General, I believe that efforts
were made to make the Bradley amphibious?

643
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,557
Yes, although how that's relevant
I fail to comprehend.

644
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,797
How many Bradleys
were lost during that experiment?

645
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,239
Lost?

646
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,193
The report says
four of the Bradleys sank during testing.

647
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,231
That is a matter of opinion.

648
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,556
It's not opinion, General.

649
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,591
Four of them sank.

650
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,193
Technically, yes.

651
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,834
General,
can we get back to the fuel tanks?

652
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,637
Come on. Good.

653
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,273
Sergeant, have the tanks
always been filled with water?

654
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,432
No, sir.

655
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,199
Only when the vehicle is being tested, sir.

656
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,231
What else don't I know?

657
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,915
Sergeant, I'm asking you a question.

658
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,474
What else don't I know about these tests?

659
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,518
The ammunition stored in the Bradley, sir.

660
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,352
What about it?

661
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,439
Sand.

662
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,436
That's affirmative, sir.

663
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,351
Tell me...

664
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,073
did the term "court-martial"

665
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,111
ever enter anyone's mind here?

666
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,151
- No, sir.
- Really?

667
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,316
That's truly amazing, Sergeant.

668
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,399
Here we are watching
water drip out of the gas tanks

669
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,318
and sand spill out of the ammunition

670
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,399
after a test that was done to figure out
whether or not the damn thing is safe!

671
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,309
And no one here even thinks
of the term "court-martial"?

672
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,836
Now why, if you don't mind my asking, is that?

673
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,513
We were under orders, sir.

674
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,870
Is acting on those orders
conscionable, Sergeant?

675
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,230
It doesn't matter what I think or do, sir,

676
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,748
because you desk warriors from Washington

677
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,950
will find a million different ways

678
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,992
to make the tests turn out
whatever way you want, sir.

679
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,715
I'm not here to manipulate test results.

680
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,274
- I'm here to learn the truth.
- You want the truth, sir?

681
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,835
We get a new white knight
every other year, sir.

682
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,917
Some guy just like you,
and you all start off the same.

683
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,114
Big speeches that turn to shit after six months
when your next promotion comes due.

684
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,390
And then it's business as usual.

685
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,228
Where did you pick up
this lousy attitude, Sergeant?

686
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,236
Right here, sir,

687
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,791
watching guys like you.

688
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,436
Well, I'm sorry.

689
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,750
I'm really sorry to hear that.

690
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,956
Cos unlike you, I take my job seriously.

691
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,839
Really?

692
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,677
Well, maybe... maybe
you can explain to me, Colonel,

693
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:05,192
why the Bradley has been ordered into
production before you have done your job.

694
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,510
What is this?
100 Bradleys have been ordered?

695
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:30,190
I'm not gonna have it on my record
that the Bradley fell behind schedule

696
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,196
because of some goddamn tests.

697
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,879
Those goddamn tests could save lives.

698
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,357
The Bradley will save lives, Colonel,
by bringing men to the front line.

699
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,755
Do you know what would happen to those men

700
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,598
if the Bradley is hit and the aluminium burns?

701
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,238
I know all about the British study, Colonel.
And it is bullshit.

702
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,874
That thing could be a deathtrap.

703
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,070
- Says who?
- Says me.

704
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,873
Have you put people in there during the test?

705
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,469
- No, of...
- So you don't actually know anything.

706
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,195
And until you do,
all you're doing is wasting our time.

707
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,838
Are you suggesting Colonel Burton
had no reason to be concerned?

708
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,919
I am suggesting
that Colonel Burton and his tests

709
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,919
did not reveal anything
we didn't already know.

710
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,713
Except his own penchant for theatrics.

711
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,513
- Theatrics, General?
- Yes, theatrics.

712
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,676
Cheap theatrics at that.

713
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,188
Now the little prick has issued a memo

714
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,791
that stipulates that for the tests
he'd like to use sheep.

715
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,150
Jesus, we already started work
on the chassis assembly.

716
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,350
- Don't worry.
- If the sheep die

717
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,279
- we're gonna have to stop production.
- There are ways around it.

718
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,231
- Absolutely.
- Like what?

719
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,874
We could sic the animal rights people on him.

720
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,037
It is cruel and unusual treatment of sheep.

721
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,196
Rack of lamb.

722
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,598
Yeah, that would be me.

723
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,836
- Yes.
- Major Sayers just called, sir.

724
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,396
- When do they plan to run the tests?
- As soon as we send over the sheep.

725
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,830
"We"? I thought they were
in charge of the sheep.

726
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,348
They say it's being handled at our end.

727
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,874
The Surgeon General's office.

728
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,430
What does the Surgeon General
have to do with sheep?

729
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,150
- Excuse me.
- Colonel Burton.

730
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,431
- We were told you might show up.
- Who told you that?

731
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,110
Colonel Bach, he established this office
last week with the Surgeon General.

732
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,153
- You're trying to kill the Bradley.
- Who told you that?

733
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,628
I'm sorry, sir, all information
in this office is classified.

734
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,834
So, what is
"ruminant procurement" anyway?

735
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,353
That's what this office has been created to do.

736
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,029
- But what is it?
- Analysis and policy determination

737
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,959
for tendered research data
on the optimal test ruminant.

738
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,797
Such ruminants are to be...

739
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,516
You're talking about sheep.
You're in charge of buying sheep, correct?

740
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,468
We can't just go out and buy sheep, sir.

741
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,112
Why not?

742
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,038
We're doing a vaporifics test on sheep.

743
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:24,996
Vaporifics is all about what happens
when a warhead penetrates armour.

744
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,077
Lieutenant, I know what a vaporifics test is.

745
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,031
I'm the one who called for it.

746
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,551
Well, then you know we have to have
sheep specs before we can proceed.

747
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,353
Sheep specs, what is sheep specs?

748
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,072
Specifications!

749
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,750
Shorn or unshorn, rams, ewes or lambs?

750
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,478
Merinos or short hair?
Shorn merino ewes or unshorn merino lambs?

751
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,593
Bighorns or domestic?
Domestic shorn lambs or bighorn unshorn?

752
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,030
Just, how long will it take you
to get your sheep specs?

753
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,117
Not long at all, six, eight months, tops.

754
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,518
But then we'll require another eight months
to evaluate the data.

755
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,633
After which we can move
into prototype ruminant evaluation...

756
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,635
- How much?
- Well...

757
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,276
All right, bring it back.

758
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,471
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

759
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,075
A little more. A little more.

760
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,599
Whoa!

761
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,871
Sir, Colonel Bach is on his way over here, sir.

762
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,115
I'm sure he is.

763
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,391
It sounded like a world-class shit-fit, sir.

764
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,271
I'm sure it is, Sergeant.

765
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,317
- Come on, move it.
- What are these sheep doing here?

766
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,828
- I bought them.
- You can't do that!

767
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,758
- Well, I did.
- There are no sheep specs, Colonel!

768
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,678
- I devised the specs, Major.
- What are they?

769
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,871
They're live and kicking,
and that's good enough for me.

770
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,198
Testing is a science, Colonel.
It needs controlled experiments.

771
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,472
- Just sticking sheep into a...
- All right, you don't want sheep?

772
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,037
Lennon, Chavez,
get the sheep out of there,

773
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,674
- and get in the Bradley. Dalton!
- Yes, sir?

774
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,312
Get in the Bradley.

775
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,437
- Sir?
- I need a vaporifics test, get in the Bradley.

776
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,756
- Everyone inside.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

777
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,031
You think this is
some kind of joke, Colonel?

778
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,549
All right, we'll just use the sheep.
That's a terrific idea.

779
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,273
Use the sheep in the Bradley.
Go on, sheep.

780
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,788
Get in there... God damn it!

781
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,598
Backblast area, clear!

782
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,279
- On the way, sir.
- Fire!

783
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,714
Oh, God, Granger, don't breathe!

784
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,632
- What the hell happened?
- The damn fumes!

785
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,557
Stay back!

786
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,193
- How are you doing?
- I'm OK.

787
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,834
Jesus, just one tiny whiff...

788
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,030
Did you get a look inside?

789
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,435
Nothing could have survived those fumes.

790
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,151
Sergeant, where are the sheep?

791
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,760
Major Sayers said they had to be incinerated.

792
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,950
- What?
- They carted them away, sir.

793
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,833
Whoa! No! Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

794
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,751
- Follow those sheep!
- Sir?

795
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,831
- Stop that truck, that's an order!
- Yes, sir.

796
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,279
Sergeant.

797
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,993
I need them, for autopsy.

798
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,956
To verify test results.

799
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,396
I see him, we got him, sir.

800
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,317
- Pay no attention to them!
- Sir?

801
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,157
Concentrate on the sheep.

802
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,389
Look out!

803
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,553
Move it!

804
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,999
Come on!

805
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,914
Damn it, what are you stopping us for?

806
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,633
- Stop the sheep!
- What's the hurry, sir?

807
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,276
Not one of the tests I've ordered
has been conducted according to plan.

808
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,435
And since my job...

809
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,190
Your job is to stop whining and serve
the United States as befits an officer!

810
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,155
My job is to oversee the joint live-fire
test programme and report to Congress.

811
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,512
In order to do that, I'm gonna have to insist
on a live-fire test of the Bradley

812
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,391
under combat conditions.

813
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,149
Listen to me, fly-boy,
you don't know shit about combat!

814
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,272
I know there are a lot of ways
to die in that vehicle, sir.

815
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,118
- Don't you preach to me!
- I want a realistic...

816
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,233
- The number one priority is...
- People first, vehicles second!!

817
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,512
Those are my priorities. The Army's
priorities seem to be the exact opposite.

818
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,028
You are way out of line here.

819
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,308
I won't sign off on the Bradley
without a live-fire test.

820
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,878
- Sir?
- Who is Burton's commanding officer?

821
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,559
General De Grasso, sir.

822
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,511
Get him for me now.

823
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,915
It's an economic move, Colonel,
you're being reassigned.

824
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,472
In the meantime, should I... continue
in my present assignment?

825
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,479
Your present assignment
has been eliminated, Colonel.

826
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,353
I didn't think my job could be eliminated.

827
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:24,353
- I was appointed by Congress.
- But you're paid by the Army.

828
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,593
If they can't afford you - and they can't -
you have no job.

829
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,351
Colonel, it's time to move on.

830
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,996
Let's not let this little blip on the screen
ground you permanently.

831
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,753
Would the Colonel ever consider
having a drink with an enlisted soldier?

832
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,349
Does the enlisted soldier
think the Colonel needs one?

833
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,114
- What are they gonna do, fire you?
- OK, just a little one.

834
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,076
You know what's really ironic?

835
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,830
General Omar Bradley was a brilliant tactician
and a great leader.

836
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,030
No ego, just did the job.

837
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,717
And he looked out for the morale
and the safety of his men.

838
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,911
And they go and put his name on this thing!

839
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,791
Talk about a kick in the ass.

840
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,957
The closest the brass ever get to a battlefield

841
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,878
is the first tee on a Saturday morning.

842
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,910
You know, Fanning...

843
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,793
I've been around long enough to know
that the Pentagon is not a charity,

844
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,398
it's cashflows and egos.

845
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,910
That's part of it, it's what helps drive it,
fine, but...

846
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,637
somehow...

847
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,148
somehow I always thought the men came first.

848
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,677
I always thought that the people on top knew

849
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:52,757
that it was about the soldier in the field.

850
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,275
You gave it your best shot.

851
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,554
- Did I?
- Yes, sir, you did.

852
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,598
Well, now it's somebody else's problem.

853
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,029
My problem is salvaging my career.

854
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:19,438
Which apparently is not beyond repair
if I'm a good little boy.

855
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,519
So, that's it.

856
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,073
That's it.

857
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,680
The man said, "war is hell".

858
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,836
He should've tried peacetime.

859
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,116
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, be my guest.

860
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,310
I don't believe in government waste.

861
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,519
- Burton.
- So they're moving you out?

862
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,716
Is there anything you don't hear about?

863
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,469
Well, how far are you willing to go
with this thing?

864
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,479
The question is...
how far are they going to send me?

865
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,956
You ought to take a trip to California
this weekend.

866
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,594
I'm not up for a vacation right now.

867
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,757
No one goes to Fresno
for a vacation, Colonel.

868
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,832
- Can I help you, sir?
- Colonel Burton.

869
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,599
I'm here to see the project manager.

870
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,511
- Colonel Burton?
- Yes.

871
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,357
Steve Johnson, project manager.

872
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,391
Hi, thank you.

873
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,034
All set, let's go!

874
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,117
What's going on here?
Who changed the specs?

875
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,559
The Israelis.

876
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,398
The Israelis? When?

877
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,431
When they placed their order.

878
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,475
- So these are for export?
- Yes.

879
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,239
- All of them?
- Yes, Colonel.

880
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,558
You're telling me we're manufacturing
two different versions of this vehicle?

881
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,388
The Israelis wouldn't take the Bradley
as designed, Colonel.

882
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,159
They wanted the fuel tanks on the outside,

883
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,272
reinforced armour,
a different ventilation system...

884
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,790
All right.
What about the specs for our Bradleys?

885
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,958
Exactly like the ones
you're testing, Colonel. No change.

886
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,152
- You think you were followed?
- Followed?

887
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,397
I drove for hours.
I don't even know where we are.

888
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,796
Maybe you'd prefer to meet
at the officers' club?

889
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,110
- When did the Israelis test it?
- They didn't have to,

890
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,789
they knew by looking at it
that it was a deathtrap.

891
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,673
So while we're sending our guys off to die,

892
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,508
the Pentagon brass is redesigning
the damn thing for somebody else!

893
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,597
They can't sell it overseas like it is.

894
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,230
Business as usual.

895
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,470
So maybe you'd like to keep
fighting the bastards?

896
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:13,119
I've lost my job, General.
They're moving me out.

897
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,312
So, they're moving you out,
you haven't been discharged.

898
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,716
Work from inside,
from wherever they send you.

899
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,194
And turn into you?

900
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,035
Passing anonymous notes
and meeting in parking lots?

901
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,830
You're great at sitting in the shadows.
Why don't you do something?

902
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,871
I can't.

903
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,515
- Help me!
- I have done everything that I can.

904
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,313
I've been fighting this for almost 20 years.

905
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:46,319
I'm not gonna go to the mat over this!
I... I've got too much to lose.

906
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,191
70,000 troops.

907
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,751
70,000 American boys
will ride into battle in the Bradley

908
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,870
if America fights another war.

909
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,356
We can't be a part of
sending them to their deaths.

910
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,357
One call.

911
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,757
- What?
- One call.

912
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,791
I'll make one call and that's it.

913
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,598
Sit down.

914
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,638
General Partridge, you've read
today's Washington Post?

915
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,955
- I have.
- And seen the story,

916
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,958
attributed to a highly placed Pentagon source?

917
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,028
Yes, and I am as distressed as you that
anyone in the Pentagon would stoop so low.

918
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,914
Leaks within the Pentagon
are how I get most of my information.

919
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,999
Are you suggesting that
the Pentagon is less than forthcoming?

920
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,113
Then perhaps you can explain
why I have to learn from the press

921
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,199
that the man in charge
of testing the Bradley has been fired?

922
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,749
- He wasn't fired, sir, he was reassigned.
- By whom?

923
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,758
By General De Grasso,
his commanding officer.

924
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,995
I'm as shocked as you are.

925
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,238
I guess there was some confusion
between the Army, the Air Force...

926
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,589
The sort of trouble you always get

927
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,394
with these cross-departmental
joint-testing programmes.

928
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,952
- Yes.
- Congressman Stratton is on the phone.

929
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,832
Sam, what can I do for you?

930
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,633
What article? Oh, that article.

931
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,831
No, completely untrue, inter-office SNAFU.

932
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,110
File it under creative journalism.

933
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:52,632
I'm looking into it now,
you'll be the first to know. Right. Right.

934
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,477
My best to Ellen.

935
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,752
General, I want a full update on the Bradley

936
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,711
- and I want it in writing.
- Right away, sir.

937
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:13,112
That is the last call
I expect to receive on this matter

938
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,913
from Congressman Stratton
or anyone else on the Hill.

939
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,710
Do I make myself clear, General?

940
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,352
Perfectly.

941
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,354
Colonel Burton, I want you to write
your report on the Bradley.

942
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,472
Sir? I was under the impression
that my job had...

943
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,511
Your job has been reinstated.

944
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,757
I want your report on my desk
by 1800 hours tomorrow.

945
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,837
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, in case you are unaware,

946
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,476
as per the military manual, you will deliver
your report to me and to me alone.

947
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,069
Should a single copy be made public,
I will charge you with

948
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,272
subversion of military procedure
and have you court-martialled.

949
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,397
Stop packing, we're staying.

950
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,876
- How'd you do that?
- I didn't do anything.

951
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,480
- Do we have a rule book?
- A rule book, sir?

952
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,876
- A book with rules in it.
- What do you need a rule book for?

953
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,037
To play by the rules,
cos I always play by the rules.

954
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:50,039
Then why do you need a rule book
to tell you what the rules are?

955
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,676
I need a rule book to tell me which rules I...
Just get me the book.

956
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,115
You need anything else, sir?
Chinese food, No-Doz?

957
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,355
No, thank you, Sergeant, I'm fine.

958
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,031
Well, then, night, sir.

959
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,195
What sounds better?

960
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,755
"The Bradley has so far
failed virtually every test"

961
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,189
or "The testing program of the Bradley

962
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,038
"has been without any coherent standards"?

963
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,357
They both sound like something
the General wouldn't want in his report.

964
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,029
This is not just a report,
it's a deadly weapon.

965
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,277
Sir, an M-16 is a deadly weapon.

966
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,390
A report is just a pile of paper,

967
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,399
unless you plan to inflict
a lot of extremely vicious paper cuts.

968
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,317
Go home, Sergeant.

969
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,237
Good night, sir.

970
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,270
"The failure of the Bradley to incorporate
even the most elementary safeguards

971
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,632

- Rewrite it!
- Sir?

Rewrite the fucking piece of garbage
so it smells like a rose!

01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,677
Thank you, sir.

997
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,359
- But, sir...
- What?

998
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,880
What does it mean?

999
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,832
What do you mean, what does it mean?
You wrote it.

1000
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,191
- Afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

1001
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:37,075
"The Bradley tests have been
extremely consistent."

1002
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,430
This thing is exactly the opposite
of what you wrote.

1003
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,118
How can they do that?

1004
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,628
They're playing by the book, Sergeant,

1005
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,636
and so am I.

1006
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,877
Paper cuts...

1007
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,557
vicious paper cuts.

1008
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,195
"The characterisation in your report
is at best a serious misunderstanding

1009
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:15,916
"of the testing procedures
on a vehicle as flawed as the Bradley.

1010
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,191
"As noted in my original report,
the integrity..."

1011
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:23,669
Jesus Christ! Who did this fucking thing go to?

1012
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,837
The distribution page listed 198 names.

1013
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,190
Court-martial the son of a bitch!
Lock him up now!

1014
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,629
- We can't.
- We sure as hell can!

1015
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,592
Burton's report was classified,
it was sent to you,

1016
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,835
you revised it and sent it back to him.

1017
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,950
He wrote a memo on your revision

1018
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,357
which can be sent to anyone
remotely involved with the Bradley.

1019
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,709
In this case, 198 people.

1020
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,956
I will fucking kill him.

1021
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,788
I will fillet him, draw and quarter him,
stick his head in a vice.

1022
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,276
We can't touch him, sir. It's by the book.

1023
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,359
Then you find something in that book
that'll help me fry the son of a bitch!

1024
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,799
What?

1025
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,273
Sir, the Washington Post is on the phone.

1026
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,072
That was fast. Leaks don't usually
get to them till after lunch.

1027
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,075
Yes. No, we cannot comment
on that right now.

1028
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,712
Yes?

1029
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,354
No, he cannot comment on that.

1030
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,757
I'm sorry, but under military rules,
I'm unable to comment.

1031
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,597
I... I can't comment.

1032
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,154
No. No, no comment.

1033
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,595
Sorry, goodbye.

1034
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,438
I'm getting lockjaw from not saying anything.

1035
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,199
Burton.

1036
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,198
I... I can't comment.

1037
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,515
Is there anything I can comment on?

1038
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,831
Well, yes.

1039
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,628
I've just received orders
that I am to report for duty in... Alaska.

1040
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:05,036
Alaska is a prestige posting, Senator.

1041
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,436
No, no, no,
I assure you that memo of his

1042
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,790
had nothing to do with his being transferred.

1043
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,231
Senator, I'm sorry, I've just been informed
Secretary Weinberger is on the other line.

1044
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,795
I'll get right back to you.
I promise, thank you.

1045
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,515
Sir, Weinberger is on two,
line one is the Times.

1046
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,313
Three is the Wall Street Journal,
four is Newsweek,

1047
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:30,114
line five is the House
Armed Services Committee.

1048
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,116
What do they want?

1049
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,834
Hearings, sir. On the Bradley.

1050
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,999
Alaska?

1051
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,952
- What?
- I said Alaska, General.

1052
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,477
As I said in my opening remarks,
Madam Chairman,

1053
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:56,195
a lot of things have to come together
to create teamwork.

1054
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,636
- Good old-fashioned teamwork.
- Yes, you told us, General.

1055
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,956
And Colonel Burton's not a team player,

1056
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,560
he's a rogue operator.

1057
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,034
I'm not a name-caller, Madam Chairman.

1058
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:14,039
But if you wish to make that connection,
that would be your choice, not mine.

1059
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,116
Did you ever say to Colonel Burton

1060
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:21,234
"If I get one more call from the Hill
about your, uh, expletive deleted, reports,

1061
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,555
"you'll be sitting on your brains"?

1062
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,434
- Does that sound like me, sir?
- Answer the question, General, please.

1063
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,995
I don't remember saying it.
Not that I wasn't provoked.

1064
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,393
Two witnesses testified that you said
those words to Colonel Burton

1065
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,590
outside the Pentagon pharmacy.

1066
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,313
I have visited the pharmacy.

1067
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,318
Quite a bit lately for antacids.

1068
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,759
But I would never say
anything like that to anyone.

1069
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,675
Let alone a fellow officer.

1070
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:57,269
But what about your antagonism
towards Colonel Burton?

1071
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,915
It's his report that I don't approve of.

1072
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,517
Colonel Burton's report is fallacious,
misinformed, and accusatory.

1073
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:13,635
And I have no use for an officer who is
more interested in grabbing headlines

1074
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,240
than he is in defending this country.

1075
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,991
I thought he was in Anchorage.

1076
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,877
Madam Chairman, Colonel Burton's here.

1077
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,553
The committee would like to call as witness

1078
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,990
Colonel James G Burton,
United States Air Force.

1079
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,550
- Madam Chairman.
- Yes, General?

1080
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,276
Under the rules of military conduct,
no man can appear at these hearings

1081
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,915
without the express order
of his commanding officer.

1082
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,475
Unfortunately, General De Grasso
is on a tour in Germany.

1083
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,752
General De Grasso has not ordered
Colonel Burton to testify.

1084
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,590
You're quite right, but as Colonel Burton
has been transferred to Alaska,

1085
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,916
he's no longer under
General De Grasso's command.

1086
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,951
Am I correct?

1087
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,678
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth

1088
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,915
- so help you God?
- I do.

1089
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,872
Looks like you've stirred up
a hornet's nest, Colonel.

1090
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,195
It was never my intention, ma'am.

1091
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,151
What was your intention?

1092
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,831
Simply to do the job I was assigned to do.

1093
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:02,118
The Army test reports do not make
the possibility of casualties a top priority.

1094
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,438
In fact, General Partridge's
report on the Bradley

1095
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,153
doesn't even mention the word casualty,

1096
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,918
not once.

1097
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,990
I came to the conclusion that
what was required was a live-fire test.

1098
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,316
I requested such a test, repeatedly.

1099
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:24,879
- Did you get that test?
- No, ma'am, I did not.

1100
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,319
Why not?

1101
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,433
I wanted more realism than Army testing
was accustomed to providing.

1102
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,948
You want realism?

1103
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,150
General, you are out of order!

1104
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,432
Madam Chairman, in the interest
of resolving some of these issues,

1105
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,710
I'd like to say something.

1106
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,751
Please be brief, General.

1107
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,631
Of course.

1108
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:54,793
Colonel Burton wants more realism,
so let's talk about the real world.

1109
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,276
The real world has enemies in it.

1110
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:03,551
There are forces at work,
even now as we speak

1111
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:09,596
with one objective in mind -
the destruction of this country.

1112
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,878
We must not, we will not
allow those forces to prevail,

1113
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,959
for if we do,
you can be certain that you and I,

1114
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,152
and everyone else
will never again enjoy the luxury

1115
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,397
of meeting in this building
to debate anything!

1116
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,353
As I said at the outset,
we are in the business of winning.

1117
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,914
That takes teamwork.

1118
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,997
General, the teamwork you so prize,
I take it it was in full force

1119
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,838
during the development of the Bradley?

1120
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,472
Textbook!

1121
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,075
Perhaps you'd like to tell us
how much has been spent so far

1122
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,588
to develop the Bradley?

1123
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,631
How much?

1124
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,399
Well, you have the figures, don't you?

1125
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,158
Of course.

1126
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,199
14.

1127
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,629
- More or less.
- 14.

1128
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,670
- 14.
- Million?

1129
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,038
Bill... ion.

1130
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,150
What did you say, General?

1131
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,519
Billion.

1132
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,633
Billion... with a B?

1133
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,590
With a B.

1134
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,435
$14 billion for designing
one armoured vehicle?

1135
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,956
That's one way of looking at it.

1136
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,877
Of taxpayers' money.

1137
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,708
We are all taxpayers, after all.
We're in this together.

1138
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,357
General, how many years
has this programme been running?

1139
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,990
Bear with me, just a moment.

1140
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,554
Um... er...

1141
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,592
Let me... Ah.

1142
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,875
Let's see. 12, 15...

1143
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,553
- 17.
- What?

1144
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,031
17.

1145
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,708
Which is evidence...

1146
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,829
of the enormous care my team takes

1147
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:12,318
in the development of every weapons system
undertaken by the Pentagon.

1148
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,392
Hm.

1149
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,112
17 years.

1150
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:24,669
$14 billion of the taxpayers' money.

1151
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,269
General, I think it's time
the American public

1152
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,438
gets the live-fire test
that Colonel Burton wants.

1153
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,710
- Tomorrow's the big day, sir.
- Uh-huh.

1154
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,431
I'll tell you one thing.

1155
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,632
Every damn one of these nuts and bolts
has been taken off and put back on again.

1156
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,952
This wouldn't be flame retardant, would it?

1157
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,391
You think they made the men
trick this whole thing up?

1158
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,949
It wouldn't surprise me.

1159
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,592
Not a bit.

1160
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,079
Room, attention.

1161
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,678
At ease, gentlemen.

1162
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,911
Looks like you've been working hard.

1163
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,036
- Corporal.
- Sir?

1164
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,150
Let me have one of those M-16s.

1165
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,996
I wanna tell you a story.

1166
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,311
You got a problem with that, Sergeant?

1167
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,156
No, sir.

1168
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,510
About a year ago,
I went to the veterans' hospital

1169
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,518
to visit a friend of mine
from my flying days.

1170
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,309
Only I took a wrong turn
when I got off the elevator.

1171
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,477
Now, when I look back on it,

1172
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,875
I think I was meant to go down that corridor.

1173
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,079
Cos that's where I met Phil.

1174
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,114
Thank you, Corporal.

1175
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,789
- But, sir...
- Let me finish, Dalton.

1176
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,872
I want to pass on something
I learned about the M-16 from Phil.

1177
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,151
You all know the M-16 better than I do.

1178
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,909
A lot of you used it in Vietnam.
But you were lucky.

1179
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,317
In the early days of that war,

1180
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,831
they sent guys off to fight
with M-16s that jammed in combat.

1181
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:51,273
A little bit of dust, a little bit of rain,
and the gun was useless.

1182
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,956
Maybe those early M-16s
weren't tested properly.

1183
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,150
Maybe somebody somewhere
was more worried

1184
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:02,432
about a production schedule or a promotion

1185
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,393
than he was about those grunts
in some faraway jungle,

1186
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:10,035
who might end up with
their stomachs in their hands.

1187
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,869
But you don't know anyone
that happened to, do you?

1188
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,310
No. I'm sure not.

1189
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,476
Otherwise you'd be out there right now

1190
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,116
making sure that that Bradley
is exactly - and I mean exactly -

1191
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:32,597
the way it would be
under normal combat conditions.

1192
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,792
With some of your buddies
riding inside, guys like Phil.

1193
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:42,472
Only Phil has been in a coma
for the last 20 years.

1194
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,752
Since the day his M-16 jammed
somewhere outside of Vinh Long.

1195
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,153
But hell, you don't know the guy.

1196
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,399
Or anybody like him.

1197
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,793
Right?

1198
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,028
Sir?

1199
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,435
Over here!

1200
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:06,109
- General!
- Good morning, sir.

1201
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,958
- Everything all right?
- Fine, sir, just fine.

1202
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,678
Keep coming. Keep coming. Keep coming.

1203
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,393
A little more. Keep coming. Keep coming.

1204
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,431
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

1205
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,828
- Everything all right, Sergeant?
- Fine, sir.

1206
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,518
- Thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

1207
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,391
Welcome, Sergeant.

1208
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,391
Jeez. Looks like some party.

1209
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,315
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

1210
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,553
Thank you.

1211
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:07,273
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished members of Congress.

1212
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:11,632
I think it's fair to say that
you'll be seeing enough from this test

1213
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,912
to give you the basis once and for all
to form your own conclusion

1214
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,670
about the sort of systemic excellence
we've been pursuing.

1215
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,790
I will be giving the signal shortly.

1216
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:28,073
When I do, I want you
to visualise combat conditions.

1217
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,398
Imagine that the men firing that round
are the enemy.

1218
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:36,718
And that the Bradley,
I don't have to tell you...

1219
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,955
the Bradley is on our side.

1220
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,073
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished members of Congress,

1221
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:46,192
I give you your Bradley fighting vehicle.

1222
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,751
Can you believe this?

1223
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,951
Sergeant.

1224
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,116
Everything's gonna go as planned, isn't it?

1225
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,151
It will go exactly as it should, sir.

1226
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,430
As planned, right?

1227
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,959
Corporal, this is Sergeant Dalton.

1228
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,356
Move the vehicle about five yards forward
and then clear out. Over.

1229
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,958
Roger that.

1230
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:26,438
For your further edification,
the Bradley can be fired accurately...

1231
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,790
How much fuel is in those tanks, Sergeant?
Just enough to do those manoeuvres?

1232
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,434
No more than it would have
if it was in combat, sir.

1233
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:36,951
Seven TOW missiles fired
from a launcher mounted on the left side...

1234
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,073
- And the ammunition inside the Bradley?
- Up to spec, sir.

1235
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,111
- Whose specs?
- Manoeuvrable,

1236
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,630
- and capable of keeping pace with...
- No! No!

1237
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:51,470
Carrying infantry troops
needed to support tank operations,

1238
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,273
more than we have in the test conditions.

1239
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,675
And the hour is at hand.

1240
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,029
All eyes front on the Bradley fighting vehicle.

1241
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:07,438
The vehicle that will carry our boys to victory
for many, many years to come.

1242
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,437
Backblast area clear!

1243
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,233
Fire!

1244
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,551
Who's the best, baby?

1245
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,591
Dalton, Granger!

1246
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,908
- Sir.
- Sir.

1247
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,713
Could you explain, please?

1248
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,717
We tried to tell you, sir.

1249
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,435
You see, sir, when you gave us
that speech last night

1250
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,313
we had already fixed the vehicle
back to the way it should be.

1251
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,591
So you were...

1252
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,877
- you were ahead of me.
- I don't know about ahead,

1253
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,708
but we've been behind you
ever since you fried those mannequins.

1254
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:44,113
And the sheep, sir. Man, that was epic!

1255
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,756
I'm sorry I made you listen
to that lecture now, I...

1256
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:00,076
Sir, you have nothing to apologise for, sir.

1257
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,151
We had you figured wrong.

1258
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:09,079
The men come first with you,
and you proved that.

1259
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,554
It was a hell of a good speech though, sir.

1260
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,149
Any time you want to give another one,
you know where to find us.

1261
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,791
Thank you, men. Thank you, all.

1262
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:24,192
Sir.
