1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,200
'and I have a message for them.'

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,600
The tyrant will soon be gone.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
The day of your liberation is near.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,700
'All the decades of deceit
and cruelty have now reached an end.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,300
'Saddam Hussein and his sons
must leave Iraq within 48 hours.'

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,000
Their refusal to do so
will result in military conflict

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,900
commenced at a time
of our choosing.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
'Events in Iraq have now reached
the final days of decision.'

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,500
Where's Mama? Inside,
she's packing. Why is she packing?

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,100
Mama, what are you doing?
We can buy new glasses.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,600
Make sure your mother and sisters
have money.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,300
Go, and make sure they listen.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,900
'They must leave the country
immediately.' Mustafa, the suitcases.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,400
Hala, quickly.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,500
'But we will not leave Iraq.'

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,600
We keep moving until the Americans
are defeated. Yes, Papa. Now go.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,700
Take care of your brother, Qusay.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,600
I will.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,200
Mama, they are not important.
We have to go.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,500
This programme contains some strong
language and some violent scenes.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
EXCITED CHATTERING

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,700
MUSIC PLAYS

23
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,400
INDISTINCT

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Is that my little mouse?

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,300
HE LAUGHS

26
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,400
Are you enjoying your party?
Saddam...

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,100
Ready when you are. Ah.

28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Let's go and find Mama.

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,300
I'll just be a moment, Barzan.

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,500
Mm?

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,700
This little mousey belongs to you.

32
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Habibti.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,900
What time will he come? Soon.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,000
Mr Deputy. Mm.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Are they all here?

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Yes, everyone's here.

37
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,600
Khomeini has a big mouth.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Mm.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
SHOUTING ON TV

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Thank you, Hamdani.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,500
PEOPLE CHANT:

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,700
Heard enough? More than enough.

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
He is a thoughtless son of a bitch.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,900
Bark, bark, bark, all day long -
every day.

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,700
He is a dog with teeth, Ali.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,300
Sharp teeth.

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,500
We can offer a hand of friendship
but he will bite it off.

48
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,800
He wants his revolution
to infect all of the Arab world.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,900
Beginning with the Iraqi Shia.

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,700
Exactly.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,300
He will become more and more
dangerous by the day.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,200
Comrades...

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,700
time is running out.

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,900
America hopes for a strong Iraq.

55
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,900
The Arab world demands it. The Iraqi
people themselves deserve it.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
To the revolution.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,100
To the party.

58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,300
To unity.

59
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
To a new Iraq.

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,200
ALL: To a new Iraq.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
INDISTINCT CHATTER

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,900
I'll be out here.

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,100
Mama.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,900
How is the lemonade?

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
It's too sweet.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Raghad.

67
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Find Mohammed.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,700
Ask him to join the party,
he's shy. Yes.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,300
She's becoming a woman.

70
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,200
She's still my baby.

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,100
She should marry
Barzan's son, Mohammed.

72
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,000
It will bond the family
closer still.

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr Deputy,
the President is about to arrive.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
Mama, excuse me.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,700
Mr President. Mr Deputy.

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Sajida, you look beautiful.

77
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,800
You are too kind.

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you so much for coming,
Mr President. Hala will be thrilled.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,300
Not at all,
thank you for inviting an old man

80
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,800
to a seventh birthday party.

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
It is an important occasion.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Please, please, everybody.
Please, carry on.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Where is the birthday girl?

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
I can't see her. Here she is.

85
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,500
Where? Where? Here. Here.

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,400
All I see is a grown-up princess.
Where is little Hala?

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,500
It's me, it's me!

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,900
Then this gift must be yours,
princess. You're very kind.

89
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,300
What do we say to the President?

90
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.
You are very welcome, my child.

91
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,100
ALL: # Happy Birthday to you

92
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,800
# Happy Birthday to you

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,300
# Happy Birthday, dear Hala

94
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,100
# Happy Birthday to you. #

95
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Make a wish, habibti,
and your dreams will come true.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
CHEERING

97
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Let's leave the women
and children to their games.

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,100
We have much to discuss,
Mr President.

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,000
You must save me a piece of cake.
Of course I will.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
LAUGHTER

101
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr President...

102
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,700
Please, sit down.

103
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,600
There is something I have to say.

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
I smell disquiet.

105
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,200
I am concerned about Khomeini

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
and the proposed union with Syria.

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Khomeini continues to call on
our people to join his revolution
because he knows we are weak.

108
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,900
And this alliance with Syria
will make us weaker still. Nonsense.

109
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,800
Two Arab people together
will make a strong alliance.

110
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,500
Headed by the Syrian President.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,600
Assad of Syria will be first
and you will be second.

112
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,100
With Saddam Hussein third?
HE LAUGHS

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Is that your true objection?

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,000
I have no objection.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,500
Why object to something
that does not exist?

116
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,600
And will never exist.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
I will not allow it.

118
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,000
You will not allow it, Mr Deputy?

119
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I smell more than disquiet.

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,700
Comrade Bakr, it's over.

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,200
Stop. Say no more.

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Saddam...

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,000
your time will come.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,400
We are a team, you and me.
Look at what we have accomplished.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,300
Look at what you have accomplished.

126
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,800
Iraq has schools and hospitals
and food for all of the people.

127
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
For the first time in our history,

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,700
their minds are developed
and their bellies are full,

129
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,300
because of you and me.

130
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Our country is just beginning
to walk in the world.

131
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,500
This alliance, us,
we will make Iraq stronger.

132
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,900
So...

133
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,200
do I get to eat my cake now?

134
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
It is over, comrade.

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,700
DOORS OPEN

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,500
They won't help you.

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,800
Either you resign voluntarily
or through force.

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Either way, you resign.

139
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
You have earned your retirement

140
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,100
and it is the wish of each of us

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,800
that you get to enjoy it.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Adnan Khairallah, you are my Defence
Minister and an officer in my army.

143
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Come and stand by my side
and this...this will be forgotten.

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
Hamdani, we think alike you and me.

145
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Stand by my side.

146
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,700
You will announce your retirement
due to ill-health

147
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,300
and you will name your deputy
as your successor.

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,100
The Command Council
will never approve it.

149
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,700
You can remain in the Presidential
Palace until matters are resolved.

150
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,200
Comrade.

151
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,500
Saddam Hussein al-Majid.
My President.

152
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Tariq Aziz.

153
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
My President.

154
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,000
Hamdani, my friend.

155
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,800
Mr President.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So, it's done.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,900
You are to be President.

158
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,700
Now you will need your brothers
more than ever. Yes, Mama.

159
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,100
And no-one must be allowed to do to
you, what you have done to al-Bakr.

160
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,700
Don't worry, Mama.

161
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,600
I am making Barzan
my head of security.

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
I'll protect him, Mama.

163
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,900
Let's put you to bed.

164
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,400
Good boy.

165
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,200
I feel like tomorrow, I will
wake up in a land of...progress

166
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,700
and opportunity.

167
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,400
I have ideas to help build Iraq,

168
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,700
make it ready to take
its rightful place in the world,

169
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
and not just the Arab world.

170
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,600
We have a lot of work to do.

171
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,900
Me and you.

172
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,300
And I will always be by your side.

173
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
Already I feel different.

174
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,500
You feel empowered. Yes.

175
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
And you like it?

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,500
HE LAUGHS
Yes, very much.

177
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,100
THEY LAUGH

178
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,700
What's so funny?
Hamdani likes power.

179
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,500
Yes.

180
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,300
What's wrong with that?

181
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,700
'It is my view that the man best
qualified to assume the leadership'

182
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,000
is my esteemed deputy,
Comrade Saddam Hussein.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,100
Mr President, this is absurd!

184
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,000
Now is not the time
to be stepping aside.

185
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,900
We are on the brink
of a new era in Arab brotherhood.

186
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,100
Comrade Mashhadi,
he has made up his mind.

187
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,700
We must respect his decision.

188
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,900
Mr President, what's going on here?
What is happening?

189
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Please comrade, please,
I'm very tired.

190
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,500
Then we can only accept your
recommendation by a unanimous vote.

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Very well, we will have a vote
in our next session.

192
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,800
The members of the council
will need some time

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,600
for thoughts and reflection.

194
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,100
CLAPPING

195
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,300
Where is Hamdani? I don't know.

196
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,700
Comrades...

197
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
it causes me great pain

198
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
that one of my first duties
as President

199
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,500
is to tell you that we have
uncovered an atrocious plot

200
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,000
against our beloved Ba'ath Party.

201
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
You can end this now.

202
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,900
Just do what we need and confirm it.

203
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,100
My pain is not eased by the fact
that these collaborators

204
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
are sitting amongst us here.

205
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,300
Or...things can get worse.

206
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,900
The witness.

207
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,600
MURMURING

208
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,300
Now I want you to imagine
your daughter sitting

209
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,600
where you are sitting.

210
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,900
Imagine.

211
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,600
'Since 1975,'

212
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,500
I have been part of a Syrian plot

213
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,700
to overthrow both Comrade Saddam
and al-Bakr.

214
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,400
When we, the conspirators,

215
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,600
realised...that al-Bakr was to
step down in favour of his deputy,

216
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,800
the assumption of the presidency
by Comrade Saddam Hussein

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,300
forced us to put into action a plan
to remove him.

218
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,100
But as we did so,
we revealed ourselves

219
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
and our plans were uncovered.

220
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,700
MURMURING

221
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,800
Comrades, you can imagine
how stunned I was

222
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,700
to discover that I had been betrayed
by my closest colleagues.

223
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,200
When the first of the criminals
were arrested,

224
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,100
I asked them,

225
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,300
what political differences
are there between you and me?

226
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Did you lack any power or money?

227
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,300
And if your opinion differed...
on anything,

228
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
why didn't you bring it
to the party?

229
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,800
They had...nothing to say
to defend themselves.

230
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,500
The people whose names are read out
should leave the hall.

231
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Mohammed Ayesh.

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,300
Fouad Abdullah.

233
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,400
Amjid Haish.

234
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,900
HE CONTINUES READING NAMES

235
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,300
We have done nothing!
We have done nothing!

236
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,900
We are innocent.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,300
We are innocent. This is all lies.

238
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,500
Go out!

239
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,900
I am innocent. Out!

240
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,500
Long live Saddam! God save Saddam!

241
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,300
CHEERING

242
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Long live Saddam! Long live Saddam!

243
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,900
Mashhadi?

244
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,100
Fire.

245
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
Fire.

246
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,400
Fire.

247
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
Fire.

248
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,500
GUNSHOT
Fire!

249
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,100
My President,

250
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,700
I came as soon as I got
your message.

251
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,300
Is there something wrong?

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
Hamdani.

253
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,700
Forgive me.

254
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,100
You are always my friend.

255
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,400
I have nothing to forgive you for.

256
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
Mama?

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,700
Habibti, what is it?

258
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,200
Baba says he'll see you now.

259
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,400
Is it true that I am promised
to Mohammed?

260
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Is it true? Mohammed is a good boy.

261
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,400
And when the time comes,
you must be a good daughter.

262
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,800
A good wife.

263
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,200
It's what your grandmother
Subha wants.

264
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,700
He was your friend, Saddam.

265
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,500
His wife was my friend.

266
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,200
How am I supposed to face her?

267
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
What am I supposed to tell her?

268
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
I did...

269
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
..what was necessary.

270
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,000
The man who can sacrifice
even his best friend

271
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,500
is the man without weakness.

272
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,100
In the eyes of my enemies...
I am stronger now.

273
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,400
MAN LAUGHS

274
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,700
Don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

275
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,200
Be respectful, and just listen.
Understand?

276
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes. Hello.

277
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Here come the al-Majids.

278
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,000
No women, gentlemen? No dancing?

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,200
What's the matter with you? You
should be making the most of life.
Tomorrow we could all be dead.

280
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,700
You're a funny man, Ali.

281
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,400
HE LAUGHS
Take a seat, Hussein.

282
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,500
So who saw it coming?

283
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,000
Hamdani?

284
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Saddam.

285
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
You didn't know?

286
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,400
Did he tell you why? Only Saddam
knows what Saddam is thinking.

287
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Only Saddam knows
what we're all thinking.

288
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:19,700
You believe that? If Saddam believes
it, that's all that matters.

289
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Maybe he had a big mouth.

290
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,400
Maybe he couldn't handle his whisky.
The two don't mix.

291
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Cousin, I'm simply talking,

292
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,700
amongst friends, amongst family.

293
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,400
Hamdani wasn't family. Be careful.

294
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,100
Nor am I.

295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah, but you're a Christian,
Tariq. You're a threat
to no-one but yourself.

296
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Hamdani was too clever
for his own good.

297
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
He's the past.

298
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,100
Tonight my friends, I'm getting
drunk, I'm getting laid,

299
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,000
and in the morning,
I won't remember a thing

300
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
except my loyalty
to our President.

301
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Who is neither al-Majid
nor Ibrahim, but half and half.

302
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Go fuck a donkey. Go.

303
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,300
HE LAUGHS

304
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,100
I can't do this.

305
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,500
SOBBING

306
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,700
I loved him like a brother.

307
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,900
Hamdani, he and I spoke many times,
so many times...

308
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,500
about how we would put the nation
before our own needs.

309
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Did he ever talk like that to you?

310
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,600
Yes.

311
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,100
Always.

312
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
So I know in my heart...

313
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,300
..that he would have understood,

314
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,100
that in my place,
he would have done the same.

315
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,900
What is good for Iraq...

316
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
is good for me.

317
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,400
He believed in you, Saddam.

318
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
He followed you in all things.

319
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
And so do I.

320
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,300
Tell me...

321
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,600
what I and my children...

322
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,400
can do to serve you and Iraq.

323
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
PEOPLE CHANT: Saddam! Saddam!
Saddam! Saddam!

324
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,000
HE SINGS:

325
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Why can't we go somewhere
where there are bigger animals?

326
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm tired of shooting little birds.

327
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,200
You hear that, Saddam? Your boy
wants to shoot something bigger.

328
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,900
If Qusay was here,
I could shoot him.

329
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
One day you'll shoot a lion, Uday.

330
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,700
This is the middle of nowhere.

331
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,300
Tikrit is not the middle of nowhere.
Come. There's nothing here.

332
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,300
Mr President.

333
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,300
OK... You see?

334
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
He's yours.

335
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,700
Aim carefully.

336
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,300
Good.

337
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,800
His name is Khomeini.

338
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,100
GUNSHOT

339
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,300
LAUGHTER

340
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,100
Bastard.

341
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
Never mind. Never mind.

342
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,500
When I was a boy, if I missed,
it meant empty bellies for my family.

343
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,300
And a beating from my stepfather.

344
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,500
Come.

345
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
He was a bastard.

346
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,900
I don't know why we have to come
back to this godforsaken place.

347
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
It's home.

348
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,300
Be careful with that.

349
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,700
And this thing with the tent.

350
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,600
The entire wealth of the country
is ours, and what do we do?

351
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,900
We put up a tent!

352
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,300
HE LAUGHS
It's true, Adnan.

353
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,800
INSECT BUZZES

354
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
What's wrong
with going to London or Paris?

355
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Make him happy, Sajida.

356
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,900
If Saddam's happy,
then it will be easier for me.

357
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
What do you mean?

358
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,400
I don't want him to rush into war.

359
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
He has his sights set on Khomeini.

360
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,300
Then speak plainly.

361
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,100
As long as my sister
is on my side, I will.

362
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,900
Adnan, he loves you.

363
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,700
You are practically his brother.

364
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,300
We took him in,

365
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,400
we fed him,
we all grew up together.

366
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,200
He will listen to you.
He is President.

367
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
He will listen.

368
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,100
Be good to Subha.

369
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,300
It's hard to believe
but she still has influence.

370
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,200
Look at her.

371
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,100
She doesn't like the way I dress,
can you believe it?

372
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,900
HE CHUCKLES

373
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,300
Shh.
HE LAUGHS

374
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,500
Look around you, Uday.

375
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Look around.
The land between two rivers.

376
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,200
The first great armies and empires
were founded here.

377
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,500
Do you know the first laws
were written here?

378
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
We have the birthplace
of civilisation beneath our feet

379
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,300
and we will make it great again,
you and I.

380
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
We are lucky men, Uday.

381
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,800
We have a land to die for.

382
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,800
Baba. Mm? I'm hot.

383
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Have you heard a word I've said?

384
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,400
You are your mother's son.

385
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Of course you're hot,

386
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,500
we are in the desert.

387
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Drink some water.

388
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,500
We are hunters.

389
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,300
HE MUTTERS
Come.

390
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Next time maybe I'll bring Qusay.

391
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,500
WOMAN:

392
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,900
He did well.

393
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,900
Your mother wants to talk to you.
She's inside.

394
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,400
Isn't that Tariq?

395
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,500
What does he want?

396
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,100
I'll be with her as soon as I can.
Tell her.

397
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,200
Barzan is already
interrogating him.

398
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
An agent of Iran?

399
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,000
No doubt. Son of a dog.

400
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,700
And in the south, Mohammed Bakr
al-Sadr and his Dawa Party

401
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,400
have now pledged
open allegiance to Khomeini.

402
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,600
Treason. I have my army units
at the ready, in case of uprising.

403
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,100
Iraq's army.

404
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,700
Of course.

405
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,600
Mohammed Bakr al-Sadr is one man.
It is Khomeini who is the problem.

406
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,400
Khomeini is a cause.

407
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,500
I struggle to see any option
but military.

408
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,000
We don't want to appear weak,

409
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,500
but would it be an idea
to seek the views of our allies,

410
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,600
both Arab and Western?

411
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,600
If there is to be war,
they will benefit,
so why shouldn't they contribute?

412
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,400
And they would like to protect
their supply of oil.

413
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,800
Of course. Access to information
from American satellites
would be a great advantage.

414
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,200
Providing we know our objective.

415
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Our objective is to cut off
the head of the snake.

416
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,500
Excuse me.

417
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,900
So it's war.

418
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,100
I don't understand.

419
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,900
You're holding counsel without
the people that really matter -
the Ibrahims.

420
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,100
Mama, we are hunting. And talking.

421
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,400
Where's Barzan?
Where's Sabawi? Watban?

422
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,200
They are busy. They should be here.

423
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
Ali Hassan al-Majid is here.

424
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
He brings his cousin, Hussein.

425
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,900
Who is also my cousin. Mama, what
do you want, in the name of Allah?

426
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,000
They are eager
to show their loyalty.

427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
They are eager
to make their fortunes.

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It is your brothers
that should be always here

429
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,500
beside you at the counsel.
Half-brothers.

430
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
And your elder son

431
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,300
has the grace of a pig.

432
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,600
And your wife allows it.

433
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,900
All the way here,
he did nothing but break wind.

434
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,400
Uday is a boy, Mama.

435
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,200
What should I do, beat him?
Like Barzan's father did to me?

436
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,000
Drive him away from his home?

437
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,300
You have too much to say
to your mother.

438
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,000
Leave me.

439
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,500
I'm tired.

440
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,000
WOMAN:

441
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
GUNSHOT

442
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,200
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

443
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
SINGLE GUNSHOT

444
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,600
And cut!

445
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,500
MAN: And cut.

446
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,900
Very good. Impressive.
Is that what it was really like?

447
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,500
Well, in reality, the bullet hurt.

448
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,000
The film will cover
the early life of our President,

449
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,400
when he was fighting for
a free Iraq. It's for the people,

450
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,600
for the purposes of morale.

451
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Saddam! What an honour.

452
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,600
You did well. Thank you.

453
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,800
These gentlemen
are from Time magazine.

454
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Saddam Kamel.

455
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,900
Remarkable resemblance, don't
you think? You're cousins, right?

456
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,200
That is correct.

457
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Saddam Kamel is my brother.

458
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,500
And you're Saddam
and you're Hussein?

459
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,200
We have a lot to live up to.

460
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,800
Unbelievable.

461
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,500
We want to have good relations
with the US.

462
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
We want people in America
to understand

463
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,800
what has happened inside Iraq.

464
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,900
And is there opposition to the war

465
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,600
from the Shia in your own country,
Mr President?

466
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Ask the people directly.
Go into their homes.

467
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,900
See their love for their country.

468
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,600
And for their President.

469
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,200
No-one forces them to put pictures
of Saddam Hussein on their walls.

470
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,400
Still they choose to do that.

471
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,000
Is it true that the war
is going to bankrupt the economy?

472
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,700
These stories are lies.

473
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,800
Speak to the people.

474
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
Ask them if they want for anything.

475
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,400
And what of the reports
of Iran's military success

476
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,100
forcing Iraqi troops
back to the borders?

477
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,700
Recently Iran has been receiving
foreign assistance.

478
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,100
But what about...?
As a country of principle,

479
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,500
we are fighting
a man of superficiality.

480
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,200
Principle will be the victim.
Do you think that the...?

481
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,900
Gentlemen, we have
something special to show you.

482
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,400
ALL:

483
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Excellent.

484
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,800
You have worked very hard.

485
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,900
The children enjoy it very much.

486
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,500
Tell me...

487
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,000
how many of you have fathers
or brothers in the army?

488
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Oh!

489
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,800
Good. You should be proud.

490
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,800
This girl looks like
my own daughter, Hala.

491
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,700
She is very pretty.

492
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,800
Tell me, when you are at home
with Baba and Mama,

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
what does Baba say about Saddam?

494
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Anything at all?

495
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,500
Baba says, long live Saddam.

496
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,500
Beautiful. Thank you.

497
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,600
HE LAUGHS

498
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
Please...

499
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
Slow down.

500
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,500
I hope you have enjoyed your visit
as much as I have.

501
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,600
It would be wonderful
if you could visit us again soon.

502
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,300
I would like that.
I will arrange it.

503
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,800
Hussein is a good boy,
a good soldier.

504
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,100
He'd never let you down.
He's loyal.

505
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes. I like him. I'm pleased...
for the family.

506
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,400
Kamel Hanna. Yes, Your Excellency.

507
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
Ask the lady to join us. Yes.

508
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,100
Hussein, stand on your head.

509
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,200
For the President.

510
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,900
HE LAUGHS
He would do it!

511
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,600
For you, he would do anything.

512
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,400
Is that her?

513
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,300
She is pretty.

514
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,900
She is married. So what?

515
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,100
Mr President, we are honoured.

516
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,600
And I'm honoured
you're honoured. Please...

517
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,700
You look beautiful.

518
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,300
Sit here, next to me.

519
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,500
Thank you.

520
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,200
And may I just...

521
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,900
..so I can see you.

522
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
And I you.

523
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,600
Thank you for coming.

524
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,300
We are honoured.

525
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,900
Yes, you said.

526
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,900
May I say that your wife
is very beautiful.

527
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,000
You must love her very much. I do.

528
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
I think our President...

529
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
likes her.

530
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,800
She's my wife.

531
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,700
..Beautiful.

532
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,700
I'd really do nothing,
if I were you.

533
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,200
There will be compensation.

534
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,700
Why am I reading of Iranian
successes on the battlefield?

535
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,600
You would have been informed.

536
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,300
What else has been hidden from me?

537
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,600
Were you hiding it from me, Barzan?

538
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,100
No! No. A report has been prepared.

539
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,700
Why did we fail at Al-Muhammarah?

540
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,300
We were taking too many casualties,
and a withdrawal was ordered.

541
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,900
So our soldiers refused
to die for their country?

542
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,500
It was becoming a massacre,
Mr President.

543
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,100
It was a tactical decision
to fall back and regroup.

544
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,200
It was a coward's decision,
General Khairallah.

545
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,500
I want Colonel Ahmed al-Dulaimi
and General Jawad Shiatna executed.

546
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,300
They are two of our best.

547
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Their decision was purely tactical.

548
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,900
HE BANGS TABLE

549
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,000
The Iraqi Army

550
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,600
does not retreat!

551
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,500
Do you understand?

552
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,600
Barzan...

553
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,600
summon the commanders in question and
oversee their execution, immediately.

554
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,800
Hussein, come with me.
Stand for the President!

555
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,100
Hussein is like Saddam's
Siamese fucking twin.

556
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,100
He's doing his job, Barzan,
nothing more.

557
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,900
Yeah. He's doing something.

558
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,100
How is she?

559
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,300
Barzan's with her.

560
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,700
She's very weak.

561
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Mama...
LABOURED BREATHING

562
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,600
Barzan, leave us.

563
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,800
I want to talk to Saddam.

564
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,600
Your strength

565
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,100
is in the family.

566
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,800
Blood is permanent.

567
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,900
I want Raghad

568
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,100
to marry Barzan's boy.

569
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,000
I want you to keep
the family together,

570
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,900
my family.

571
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,200
Mama, why are you talking like this?

572
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,000
Keep Barzan close.

573
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,500
He was always loyal to you,
even when he was little.

574
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,400
You should...

575
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,500
You should rest, Mama.

576
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Yes.

577
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,100
It is a good thing

578
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,300
that you never knew your father.

579
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,600
He was bad blood.

You...

585
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,100
gave me nothing.

586
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,000
LOW CHANTING

587
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,600
Saddam. She was proud of you...

588
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,500
and of our strength as a family.

589
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,100
As I am.

590
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,400
You should know, Barzan,

591
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,300
it was her wish before she died,

592
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,300
that Raghad should marry Hussein.

593
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,900
No!

594
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,900
to my son Mohammed for years.

595
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,500
It was her wish. No.

596
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,400
She thought it was time
to recognise my father's family.

597
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,600
She said that?

598
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,200
Saddam, I've been loyal to you,
always, and now this insult,

599
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,300
not just to me
but to all the Ibrahims.

600
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
Please...

601
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,900
think of my honour.

602
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,700
Hussein, the driver of this truck
is to be arrested.

603
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,900
Those coffins should be covered.

604
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,400
Mothers and wives do not need
to be reminded of their sacrifice.

605
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Everything in the city
is to be normal.

606
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,800
Shouldn't we also be thinking
of other towns and cities?

607
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,000
Our soldiers come from all over.

608
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,800
What about the wives and mothers
of Mosul, Basra, Dujail?

609
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,300
Victory will heal everything.

610
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,500
Yes, victory
will bring rewards for all.

611
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,600
These places belong to the Shia.

612
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,200
You have to go to them.

613
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,800
Let them see you. The war is
casting a shadow only you can lift.

No-one has sacrificed more
than your brothers,

622
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:28,600

are loyal to the country,

to the party

624

They tried to kill me.
They tried to kill me.

632
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,600
We need to get you out of here.
No. We must go back.

633
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,000
To Dujail! Now.

634
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,200
Now!

635
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,600
These few shots won't frighten
the people of Iraq

636
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,000
and they won't frighten
Saddam Hussein.

637
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,300
We will find the assassins.

638
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,500
And I swear on my honour,

639
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,700
we will have justice.

Hussein, how many rounds of
ammunition were fired at my cars?

644
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,900
My estimate is in excess of 300.

645
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,000
300 rounds.

646
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,400
I'm not immortal.

647

All it takes is one bullet.
One bullet.

648
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,400
Yet these traitors were given
300 opportunities to kill me.

649
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,200
Yes, and they will be found
and punished.

650
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,400
I hear you're the second most
powerful man in Iraq, Barzan.

651
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,700
Some might say you have the most
to gain from my assassination.

652
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,100
No, no.

653
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,200
No-one is more loyal than me.

Saddam, I am your brother.

00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,900
I will do my duty.

656
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,900

Get rid of it all!

You look simply beautiful.

00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Paris is beautiful.

00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,100

That's a good one.

676
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,700
I want you to know, I would only
trust the happiness of my daughter

677
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,100
to a man who owes me everything.

678
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,200
Hussein is such a man.

679
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,800
He will be a good husband.

680
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,200

Mr President, I have things
that need to be said.

683
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,700
It is done. I have carried out
your orders to the letter.

684
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,300
Dujail has gone.

685
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,100
And it's my wedding gift to you.

686
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,500
Raghad, please...

687
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,400
The traitors, their families,
their associates - all gone.

688
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,500
I know.
I'm ready to serve my President,

689
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,000
my brother.

690
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,200
From now on, Barzan, Hussein will be
responsible for my personal security.

691
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,400
He will be my son. I trust him.

692
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,400
We will talk more later.

693
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,900
No.

694
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,400
Why are you insulting me this way?

695
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,800
I have been loyal to you.

696
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,000
I have done everything
that you ask of me.

697
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,200
I even accepted this wedding.

698
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,700
Saddam, by continuing
to favour the al-Majids

699
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,500
you are surrounding yourself
with weakness.

700
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,500
They are not interested in Iraq.

701
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,300
Know your place, Barzan.

702
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,100
They are my blood. You understand?

703
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,100
And I know a traitor
before he knows himself.

704
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,100
I have given you my soul.

705
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,600
You will attend the wedding,
and then you will leave Iraq.

710
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Cool, eh?
