2
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,124
Damn tramps...

3
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,877
Watch it!

4
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,128
Disgusting!

5
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:48,672
Is he dead?

6
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,799
The Americans'll be
arriving any day now...

7
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:53,802
It's disgraceful,
having these bums here!

8
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,980
Mama... - !

9
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:09,818
What day is it?

10
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,831
Setsuko...

11
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,843
Another one.

12
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,774
What is
this stuff?

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,819
Never mind.
Just dump it!

14
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,875
This one's a goner, too.

15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,462
You can see
it in their eyes...

21
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,528
Air raid!
Get to the shelters!

22
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,200
We're in for a big one!

23
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:48,537
The shelter behind the
firehouse should be safest!

24
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,167
It's hot!

25
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,379
Be a good girl...
Try to be patient.

26
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,386
I'd better get
over to the shelter.

27
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:08,473
Be careful, and get over
there as soon as you can.

28
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:11,268
Setsuko, be a good girl
and mind your brother.

29
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,562
Never mind us!
Get to the shelter!

30
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:15,939
Yes, yes...

31
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:19,192
Mom, do you have
your medicine?

32
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:22,070
Right here.
Don't worry.

33
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:27,993
I hate the shelter!

34
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:32,497
Well, you'll be sorry if you get
blown up by a bomb! Now get on.

35
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,505
My doll!

36
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,686
Air raid!

37
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,688
Seita!

38
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:11,203
Get down!

39
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,350
Seita!

40
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:29,406
Seita!

41
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:30,193
Long live the Emperor!

42
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:53,383
We're safe here.
Don't worry.

43
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,137
Where's Mama?

44
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,639
In the shelter.

45
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,810
The firehouse shelter can take
a hit from a 250 kilo bomb easy.

46
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,313
Don't worry about her.

47
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:20,827
She'll probably go to
Niponmatsu station to find us...

48
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,413
We'll meet her there.

49
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,666
Let's just
catch our breath first.

50
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,466
Are you okay,
Setsuko?

51
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:37,469
I lost one
of my shoes.

52
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,973
I'll buy you better ones.

53
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,727
I have money.

54
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:53,777
Open this.

55
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,414
Wow, you're rich.

56
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,301
Black rain,
from the bombing...

57
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,301
It's all gone!

58
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:06,808
Look, that was the civic hall.
We ate lunch there, once.

59
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,396
Is our house
gone too?

60
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,398
Probably.

61
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,817
What'll we do?

62
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,904
Dad'll make them pay for this!

63
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,838
Mother!

64
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,601
Well, it's not like I was the
only one who lost his house.

65
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:52,062
We're all in the same boat.

66
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:00,111
At least
we're still alive.

67
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:05,158
There were two direct hits.
The fires're impossible to put out!

68
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,120
When you try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

69
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,082
It's not her...
She's not down here!

70
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,630
Seita, I have to pee.

71
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:34,646
All residents of
Ichirizuka and Kaminishi!

72
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:40,569
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

73
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:41,653
What's wrong?

74
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,196
My eye hurts.

75
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:45,198
Don't rub it.

76
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,493
We'll get it washed
out at the school.

77
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:50,537
Where's Mama?

78
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,830
She'll be
at the school.

79
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,998
School?

80
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,750
Uh-huh. Let's go.

81
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,477
Seita!

82
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,648
Have you seen your mom?

83
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:24,362
She's hurt. You'd better go.
I'll watch your sister.

84
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,365
Wasn't that scary, Setsuko?
Did you cry?

85
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,995
Seita has to go somewhere.
Why don't we wait for him?

86
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,632
Seita. I've been looking for you.
Are you okay?

87
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:44,341
My mom...?

88
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,967
This way.

89
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,436
This IS your mother's, isn't it?

90
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,775
In here.

91
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,497
She's finally asleep.

92
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:24,339
She really should be in
a proper hospital.

93
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,135
I think Kaisei hospital in
Nishinomiya wasn't hit.

94
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:35,183
My mother has heart trouble.
Can she get her medicine?

95
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,644
I'll ask.

96
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,024
I'll be around if
you need me.

97
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,574
Mom...

98
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,179
You saw her?

99
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,557
It's terrible...

100
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,184
I'm thirsty.

101
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,901
If there's anything
I can do, just ask.

102
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,739
Oh, did you get your
biscuit ration yet?

103
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,199
I'll get it for you!

104
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:47,547
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it.

105
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,510
Mom's... hurt.
She'll get better, though.

106
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,846
Where is she?

107
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,891
In the hospital.
In Nishinomiya.

108
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:05,357
We'll stay here
at the school tonight.

109
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,362
Then tomorrow we'll go to our
aunt's place in Nishinomiya.

110
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,907
Okay?

111
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,337
We'll all be on the second floor.
Why don't you stop by later?

112
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,885
Thanks a lot. We will.

113
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,180
See you later, Setsuko.

114
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,518
Want some?

115
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,354
I want to see Mama.

116
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,400
Maybe tomorrow.
It's too late now.

117
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,788
Watch me, I'm good at this!

118
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:11,358
We haven't unbandaged her.
You don't want to see the body.

119
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,903
With this heat we're having...
She'll have to go on the truck today.

120
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,339
Where's your sister?

121
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:37,801
In Nishinomiya.
We have a distant aunt there.

122
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,512
I think she'll
take care of us.

123
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,223
I see. Lucky for you.

124
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:46,893
I'd better get back to work.
Good luck to you.

125
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,858
Mama!

126
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,527
Where is she?

127
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,863
Is she still sick?

128
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,532
Yeah. Still sick...

129
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,493
Welcome back.

130
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,331
How's your mother?
Is she at Kaisei?

131
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,545
Lucky your dad's in the Navy.

132
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,506
You get to have a truck
help move you over here!

133
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,427
I've laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

134
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,887
Thanks.

135
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,357
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

136
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,653
Did she give it to me?

137
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,327
Just be careful
you don't lose it.

138
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,878
Mom's...

139
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,841
When Mom's a little better,
I'll take you to see her.

140
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,845
Time for bed. Okay?

141
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:25,338
Dried bonito... Herring...
Dried potato... Eggs...

142
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,841
Pickled plums...

143
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,511
And I do believe this is butter!

144
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,683
You can't get these for
ANYTHING nowadays.

145
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,103
Soldiers always get the
best at times like these.

146
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,523
Anyway, did you stop by
the hospital?

147
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:47,652
I'd like to tell your mother
what's been happening.

148
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:51,239
And I could take Setsuko
along to visit her.

149
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,743
That bad?!

150
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,288
Mom... died while she
was still at the school.

151
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,291
What?! She's dead!

152
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:08,548
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why were you hiding it?!

153
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,092
I didn't want Setsuko to know.

154
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,015
Dead... How awful!

155
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,353
You'd best write your
father and tell him!

156
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,402
Seita!

157
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,364
Look!
She bought me new shoes!

158
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,992
Good for you,
Setsuko.

159
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,787
Hello there!

160
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,557
You poor dears...

161
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,559
Thanks ma'am.

162
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,855
What's that?

163
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,859
Bullfrogs.
Nothing to be scared of.

164
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,695
Firefly!

165
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,663
Try to catch it.

166
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,795
Whoops! Squashed it.

167
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,172
Ew! It smells!

168
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,675
You squeezed too hard.

169
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,623
There're millions of them!

170
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,388
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say "ah".

171
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,556
Why?

172
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,725
Just do it.
"Ah..."

173
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,906
Fruit drop!

174
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,535
Fruit drop! Fruit drop!

175
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,340
I almost swallowed it.

176
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,358
We're home.

177
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,193
Where were you?

178
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,698
Did you thank
the lady?

179
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,575
Yes ma'am.

180
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,830
That food looked good...

181
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,862
Seita. Shouldn't you be
going to school. Or something?

182
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:04,534
Yeah, but the steelworks they
had me working in was bombed.

183
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,205
And my school burned down.
There's no place to go.

184
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,875
Well, I hope you've
written to your father.

185
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,253
I already sent a letter
through the Naval Office.

186
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,713
When?

187
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,507
Just after we came here...
About 10 days ago?

188
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,178
That's strange...

189
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,514
There should have been
a reply by now.

190
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,019
Return the scissors when you've
finished with them, Setsuko.

191
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,279
How's the
war effort?

192
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,032
It's starting
to look hopeless.

193
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,703
The more factories we lose,
the harder the others have to work.

194
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,165
We're getting ready for
when they finally invade.

195
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,796
You're right. That's why food's
getting so hard to find.

196
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,051
Our soldiers aren't the
only ones who are suffering.

197
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,640
You work for our country's
defense too, young lady.

198
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,310
You eat up and work as
hard as you can!

199
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,152
Not again...

200
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,531
So you've taken in a couple
of homeless children?

201
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:30,453
Poor things... To lose their
mother when they're so young.

202
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,039
What's wrong?
Ltch?

203
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:36,334
It's hot.
I hate shelters!

204
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,880
Just hang on. Don't worry,
I'm here for you.

205
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,809
Wanna go to
the beach?

206
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,562
Yeah! Yeah!
Let's go!

207
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,455
It's all
vegetable fields now.

208
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,723
What're they doing?

209
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,725
Making sea salt.

210
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,770
It's because all the salt
and soy sauce is rationed.

211
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,982
Hurry up, Setsuko!

212
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,804
It might be a
little cold...

213
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,598
Cold!

214
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,895
Feels good, right?
You won't itch now.

215
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,322
It's a big bathtub!

216
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,865
HEY!

217
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,456
Come back here!

218
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,464
Grrr, I'm a bear!
I'm gonna eat you!

219
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,907
Snip... Snip... Snip...

220
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,498
What's wrong?
Is he sleeping?

221
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,093
Don't look at that.

222
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,098
When it gets a little warmer,
I'll teach you how to swim.

223
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,311
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

224
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,110
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

225
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,120
Seita!

226
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,790
Setsuko! Come on!

227
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:55,552
You're hungry, aren't you?
There's food here for you.

228
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,879
Mother! Were you waiting long?
It's good to see you again.

229
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,465
Are you all right here?

230
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,052
I'm fine. Don't worry!
They're very nice here.

231
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,012
I'm hungry.

232
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,516
Let's get home before we're
caught in the raid.

233
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,687
I'm tired... Carry me.

234
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,691
Air raid!

235
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,248
Your mother won't be
needing her kimono anymore.

236
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,000
Why don't you trade
them for some rice.

237
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:14,339
I've been trading off my
things bit by bit for food.

238
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,759
You can probably get a
full toh of rice for them.

239
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,135
That much?

240
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,513
You need your
nourishment.

241
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,516
You can't be a soldier if
you don't grow up healthy.

242
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,518
A whole toh of rice?

243
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,647
Your mother would be glad you
didn't let them just go to waste.

244
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,233
Why don't I take them?

245
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,694
NO!

246
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,696
Setsuko.
You're awake?

247
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:42,534
No! No!
They're Mama's!

248
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,662
They're Mama's!
Don't take them!

249
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,498
Setsuko...
Let them go!

250
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,963
Setsuko... Setsuko...

251
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,505
Fine rice, isn't it?

252
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,719
We'll have a proper rice
dinner tonight, Setsuko.

253
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,891
Here, this is yours.

254
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,109
White rice, Setsuko!

255
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,373
Here you go.

256
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,834
With my daughter and our lodger
working overtime so much...

257
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,837
...l've felt bad not having
rice to give them.

258
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,758
It's great, huh?
Real white rice!

259
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,013
More!

260
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,057
Yes, yes...

261
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,105
You're just gobbling it down
tonight, aren't you Setsuko?

262
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,023
It's good!

263
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,114
What's wrong?

264
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,866
I don't want
rice porridge!

265
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,744
Don't we have any more
pickled plums?

266
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,998
We finished
those off ages ago.

267
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,667
Here's
your lunch.

268
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,502
Thanks. I'd better
get going.

269
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:58,962
See you.

270
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,090
Bye.

271
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,466
Take care.

272
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,803
We'll have rice balls for lunch.
Just hold on till then.

273
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:10,849
Stop that!
You'll have it for lunch too!

274
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,519
You think a lazy
slug like you deserves...

275
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,856
...the same as people who
work for our nation?!

276
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,863
Seita, you're old enough to
know everyone has to cooperate.

277
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,950
You keep saying you want rice,
but do you earn it?

278
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:32,829
No, you absolutely do not!

279
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:47,385
I even give you some rice,
and you still complain!

280
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,888
But it's our rice.

281
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,391
Oh, so now I'm
cheating you, am I?

282
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:59,064
How dare you say that!
After I take you two in!

283
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:06,655
Fine! We'll just make our
OWN dinners from now on!

284
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:11,034
Seita, you have other
relatives in Tokyo, don't you?

285
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,037
On your mother's
side of the family?

286
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,751
Why not write to them?
WE could be bombed any day!

287
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,504
Problem is,
I don't know their address...

288
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,681
Let's
go home.

289
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,393
Uh-huh. Papa's
waiting for us.

290
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:41,064
Frogs are singing,
it's time to go home.

291
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,861
Sorry you had to
wait so long.

292
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,659
What's wrong?

293
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,996
I'm hungry.
And I'm thirsty too.

294
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,622
Okay...

295
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,045
Here, have a fruit drop.

296
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,550
Mom has 7000 yen in the bank.

297
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:14,556
7000... That's enough to
live on, so don't worry.

298
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:22,230
I'm telling Dad to write back
soon, because you're waiting.

299
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:34,762
You're in luck.

300
00:41:35,096 --> 00:41:40,101
You can't buy a stove like
this easily nowadays.

301
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:46,357
It's almost impossible to
find any hardware to sell.

302
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:52,196
I'll take that comb, and...
Do you have an umbrella?

303
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:56,033
An umbrella... Oh yes!

304
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:59,078
It's raining, it's raining.

305
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,252
Big brother's coming home
with an umbrella just for me.

306
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:10,423
Drip-drop, plip-plop.
Down the rain comes!

307
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:24,312
That's got it!

308
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:25,980
Be careful
with that fire.

309
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:28,024
Right...

310
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,904
What are they up to?

311
00:42:32,987 --> 00:42:35,239
They're doing their own cooking.

312
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:39,410
Good for them! More please.

313
00:42:39,494 --> 00:42:42,288
Mother, did you scold them again?

314
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:45,708
Yes, but they refuse to apologize.

315
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,921
And that boy even bought a
stove. Just to spite me!
