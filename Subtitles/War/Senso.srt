1
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:28,578
*Come! The Temple offer us
the joyness of a chaste love!*

2
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:34,124
*Come! The Temple offer us
the joyness of a chaste love!*

3
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:38,194
*Ah! Chaste love *

4
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:42,698
*Ah! The Joyness of a chaste love*

5
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,735
*Chaste love*

6
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:49,136
*Chaste love*

7
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:55,874
*Chaste love*

8
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:58,909
*-Manrico!
-What?*

9
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,416
*A Gipsy woman!*

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,644
*Come!*

11
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:03,516
*-Look! In the pyre!
-Oh, God!*

12
00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:07,318
*The pyre is on flame
by the hands of those barbarians*

13
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,589
*Oh, God!
My legs are trembling*

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,728
*A clowd darkness my sight*

15
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,800
*-Are you trembling?
-How am I not?*

16
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,331
*You should know*

17
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:19,800
*that I am*

18
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:23,965
*-Who?
-Her son*

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,841
VENICE - SPRING 1866

20
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:32,415
LAST DAYS OF AUSTRIAN OCCUPATION.

21
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:36,111
THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT SIGNS
AN ALLIANCE PACT

22
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:40,088
WITH PRUSIA. THE
LIBERATION WAR IS IMMINENT

23
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:53,503
*The flames of that terrible pyre*

24
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:58,776
*inflamed and consumed all my being!*

25
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,376
*Pitiless men, put it out,*

26
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:05,415
*or I will shortly*

27
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:10,555
*do it with your own blood...*

28
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:16,962
*I was your son before I began to love you,*

29
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:22,965
*Your torments won't stop me*

30
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:28,971
*Unhappy mother, I run to rescue you*

31
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:36,445
*or I shall die with you!*

32
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:39,277
*or I shall die with you!*

33
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:41,612
*or I shall die with you!*

34
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:49,891
*I shall die with you!*

35
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,230
*To arms! To arms!*

36
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,798
*Here we are*

37
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:56,662
*To arms! To arms!*

38
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,393
*Here we are*

39
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,207
*to defend you*

40
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:07,378
*Or we shall die with you*

41
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,046
*To arms! To arms!*

42
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,115
*Here we are*

43
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,343
*To arms! To arms!*

44
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:16,545
*Here we are...*

45
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:19,554
*to defend you*

46
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,594
*or we shall die with you*

47
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,355
*To arms!*

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,990
*To arms!*

49
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:32,296
*To arms!*

50
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,879
Foreigners, get out of Venice!

51
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,528
Gentlemen! It's the time of liberation!

52
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:04,101
¡Viva La Marmora!
¡Viva Italia! Viva Italia!

53
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,995
It's so amusing!

54
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,097
This is the war Italians
enjoy the most

55
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:09,063
Confetti rain, accompanied
with a mandolin

56
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,664
Coward!
You are a coward!

57
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,133
And I am willing to show you
that Italians want to fight

58
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,338
If you were a gentleman...

59
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,944
Let me go!
You have no right to touch me!

60
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:33,714
Long live to Italy! Long live to the Italian nation!
Long live to the Italian army!

61
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,408
-Where are you going?
-I am going outside for a while

62
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,838
It's so hot in here

63
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,674
I don't believe this is the
right time

64
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:59,477
Leave me alone!
You already know that I do what I want!

65
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:02,385
However, I won't let you
walk around

66
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:08,288
Everything started last night

67
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:10,562
It was May 27th

68
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,428
My cousin, Roberto Ussoni...

69
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,158
was one of the organizers
of the demonstration

70
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,734
and one of the main members

71
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:20,371
of the clandestine movement

72
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:21,870
in Venice

73
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,674
I was really worried

74
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:26,469
because he had shown himself unnecessarily

75
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,271
by challenging that officer

76
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:31,710
I was thinking how
I would help him

77
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,251
Roberto!

78
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,517
Livia!

79
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,455
That was insane!

80
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,754
You shouldn't had exposed
yourself in that way

81
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:47,962
It was wrong.
You shoudn't had done that!

82
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,567
I don't know whether it was good or bad,
I just lost my head

83
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,998
when that scoundrel
said those words, I...

84
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,571
-And now, what are you going to do?
-He has accepted the challenge

85
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:56,733
At least, it seems like he has...

86
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,340
We are going to fight in a duel

87
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,704
No. That's impossible!

88
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,903
An officer and you...
In your situation

89
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,273
There will be consequences..

90
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:06,008
We have to do anyting

91
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,277
Come on...

92
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,216
You have to leave the
theater right now

93
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:11,514
Go to my house

94
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:13,715
Go there or go to Marsenza's.
anywhere you want

95
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:16,793
Don't rush. I have
something to tell you

96
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,491
I beg you, Roberto!
Be wise!

97
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,597
for everyone's sake

98
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,067
I know. Don't worry

99
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:29,900
But, have you realized something tonight?

100
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,339
There's so much to do,
but they are awakening.

101
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:35,070
Let's go Roberto.
Let's walk by the docks.

102
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:36,504
Goodbye, Roberto

103
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,445
-Let's go!
-Goodbye, Livia!

104
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:40,175
-Goodbye!
-See you soon!

105
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,066
We are sorry to give up music,
dear Count

106
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:04,971
but we can not allow,
in any way, that  LA FENICE...

107
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,372
becomes a place
for revolutionary manifestations

108
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,571
Gentlemen, I am the first to
regret it

109
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,181
But your Excellence has to believe me

110
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:13,909
that this was made by
a provoker.

111
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,212
There's no doubt about it!

112
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,859
Ah, Countess Serpieri!

113
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:33,164
There's going to be a duel!
I mean it!

114
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,836
Someone has challenged Franz Mahler.

115
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:41,575
We are going to see a war
between Horaci and Curiaci.

116
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,981
You know pretty well the man who
made the challenge, Countess

117
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,344
I beg you, Excelence...

118
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,680
Let's speak no more
of this unpleasant incident.

119
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,322
This young men is a
relative,

120
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:52,491
but we seldom see him

121
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,216
Besides, the most unfamiliar people

122
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,191
-are relatives
-I know him perfectly well

123
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:01,198
There won't be a war
between Horaci and Curiaci.

124
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,461
My cousin doesn't care
about politics.

125
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,262
He is the most indifferent
and apathetic person..

126
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,497
when it comes to these issues,
I mean

127
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,040
He must have other reasons

128
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,642
That lieutenant Mahler...

129
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,481
I heard a lot about him

130
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,049
I don't doubt it.

131
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:23,016
All women in Venice
talk about him a lot

132
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,650
Oh, sure! Women talk a lot

133
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,651
and invent lots of stories

134
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:30,419
Am I right?

135
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,922
Is he an officer under your command, Excellence?

136
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:37,630
That's right. He is.

137
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,930
You know, I really would like to
meet him

138
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:43,131
Since all women in Venice
talk about him,

139
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,702
I also would like to speak with him

140
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:47,344
Countess, that's a favour

141
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,912
you shouldn't be asking to an admirer

142
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:53,142
Lieutenant Mahler is a very
dangerous rival

143
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,150
Please, would you like to sit here?

144
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,486
No, thank you, Excellence

145
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,492
"Il Trovatore" is no novelty
to me

146
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:07,560
And you Austrians

147
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,200
love music

148
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:13,063
On the other hand, we Italians,
come to the theater for very different reasons

149
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,614
*We finally get here*

150
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,652
*This is the tower*

151
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:32,756
*where prisoners cry.*

152
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:39,494
*Oh! I'm so unhappy!*

153
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,959
*Go away! Leave me.*

154
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:47,695
*And don't be afraid for me*

155
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:53,444
*Maybe I can save him*

156
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,291
*I am scared*

157
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:15,231
*My defense is secure and ready.*

158
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,536
*In this dark night*
-Countess, Lieutenant Mahler

159
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,972
-Countess Serpieri.
*I am next to you, and you don't know it*

160
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:36,949
-Would you like to take a sit?
-Thank you

161
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:43,884
*Breeze that mouns*

162
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:48,332
*and sorround us*

163
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,034
-Can you watch it?
-Very well, thank you.

164
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,632
Dou you enjoy opera, Lieutenant Mahler?

165
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:00,678
Yes, I like it very much
Countess Serpieri...

166
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:03,372
as long as the opera is good

167
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:05,682
And you, madam?

168
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,648
Yes, I like it very much.

169
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,786
But I dislike it

170
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,285
when it's performed out of the stage

171
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,594
I dislike people that act like heroes..

172
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,129
from a melodrama...

173
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,493
that don't think about

174
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,895
the consequences

175
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:25,934
of an impulsive act

176
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:29,703
or that are dictated by an unforgiveable lightness

177
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:38,982
May I talk to you with absolute sincerity?

178
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:41,785
I beg you

179
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,285
It's the only way I appreciate

180
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,591
If I am well informed,

181
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,863
there's going to be a duel tomorrow,
Isn't that so?

182
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:58,662
And it depends on you to accept or not
that challenge

183
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:03,137
I am curious.

184
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,442
You are more curious than I am

185
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,979
Don't accept the challenge.

186
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,278
It's not fair to risk your own life
just for a

187
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,647
Why are you worried so much
about my life?

188
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:20,087
It's a matter of principles.

189
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:23,460
Don't worry

190
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,186
Nor my life

191
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,863
...nor your principles
are in danger

192
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:30,901
That stupid incident

193
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,339
will finish quickly with an arrest

194
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,269
What do you mean?

195
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:48,416
*Bring back the memories*

196
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,520
Wonderful music

197
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,492
Promise me you'll come tomorrow night

198
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:59,422
Would you allow me to see you again?

199
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,196
I'm not well...

200
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,402
I have to leave right now

201
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:10,542
Please, don't move

202
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:13,108
Good night, Excellence

203
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,007
Countess, are you going to leave us?

204
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:16,647
I'm not well

205
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:18,347
I am so sorry

206
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:20,016
Good night.

207
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,187
Let's go!

208
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,754
If you don't feel well, maybe we
should wait some time.

209
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:27,425
-Let's go. I beg you
-As you wish.

210
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:14,204
Roberto has been arrested,
when he was leaving LA FENICE.

211
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,930
That's impossible!

212
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,641
He was with Donai and Meneghini.

213
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,367
Unfortunately, they have been arrested

214
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,774
We have to do something,
right away

215
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,148
Why don't you tell it
to your husband?

216
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,886
-If he wants to, he can..
-Leave that to me!

217
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,492
You must go. Go to Marsenza's house.
I'll let you know

218
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:37,526
Go right away!
Be wise!.

219
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,892
-Good night.
-Good night.

220
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,100
Have you heard?

221
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:46,737
Roberto has been arrested

222
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,536
Listen...

223
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:53,608
I have never asked you for anything

224
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,844
but this time, you have
to do something

225
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,380
to free Roberto.

226
00:15:58,684 --> 00:15:59,946
If you want to...

227
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:02,416
...you have influences,
friends.

228
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:06,489
He was denounced by that lieutenant.

229
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:07,659
I am sure!

230
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,055
-He didn't want to fight the duel
-It's obvious

231
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,661
Can you imagine an Austrian officer...

232
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,229
accepting a duel with an
Italian civilian?

233
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,956
It is absurd

234
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,764
If your cousin had more common sense

235
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,802
Don't you understand what this means?

236
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,496
Yes, I understand
I understand it perfectly

237
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,573
and I don't want anything to do
with it

238
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,438
They've done very well arresting him

239
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:27,974
And you want me to mix myself

240
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,205
with all that nonsense
that I don't even care about?

241
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,385
I am sick of this! I don't want to talk
about it anymore. Do you understand?

242
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,219
Foolish things!

243
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:38,149
Do you even know what you want to do?

244
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,093
Roberto was condemned

245
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,694
to a year in exile

246
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:46,330
just as many others.

247
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,125
I have this dark feeling

248
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,393
about what his absence
could mean.

249
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:52,627
to me.

250
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,439
-Roberto Ussoni
-Goodbye...

251
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,273
We will meet soon,
guardian angel.

252
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,875
Try to go to the train
as soon as possible

253
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:04,845
Tell it to Cavalletto, please.

254
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,280
We need a safe contact
with the two sides

255
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:09,214
I expect to come back soon.

256
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,888
Garibaldi is at Desenzano.

257
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,990
Livia! Salvation
is coming

258
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,126
See you Italians!

259
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:19,325
Roberto!

260
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,959
Take care of yourself

261
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,387
But when I met that
officer...

262
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,216
I realized he was the reasons of my worries

263
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:50,687
and that, for days, I had been afraid

264
00:17:50,896 --> 00:17:52,761
of that encounter

265
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,489
Countess Serpieri

266
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:58,931
What do you want?

267
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,968
May I scort you in these streets?

268
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,937
No, thank you, Lieutenant Mahler.

269
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:07,044
But Venice is in curfew. It's late already.

270
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:09,578
Are you going to make me arrest

271
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,443
for being in the streets?

272
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,084
I have never made an arrestment

273
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,379
for such a little infraction to the rules

274
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,088
What do you think of Roberto Ussoni's arrest?

275
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,484
Ah! Has he been arrested?

276
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:25,595
A change of air would have done
him good.

277
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:29,494
He has been sent to exile.
You know it well

278
00:18:29,768 --> 00:18:31,668
You think it is my fault

279
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,838
But you are wrong

280
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,131
I hope you believe me

281
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:39,171
Besides, it seems that Ussoni
will be satisfied.

282
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,777
It seems like the man was born

283
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:43,379
to make sacrifices for any noble cause

284
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,607
And what you were born for?

285
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,845
To be what I am

286
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:51,045
To be what you are!
Good night.

287
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,852
Don't you think it would be better that.

288
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:59,792
the other night at the opera, you
had told me

289
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:01,488
that Ussoni was your lover,

290
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,726
and that you were willing to do
anything to keep him in Venice?

291
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,171
A men with a minimum education

292
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:11,035
wouldn't take advantage of the fact that

293
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,835
I am alone to insult me.

294
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:55,277
-I told you not to follow me
-I am not following you.

295
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,122
-Ah, you dont!
-Think of me as your shadow.

296
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,355
Thanks, I can manage with my own.

297
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,659
But mine will protect you better

298
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,930
Please, stop following me.

299
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,717
-Is he dead?
-Yes.

300
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,695
What do we do now?

301
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:47,462
Come on!

302
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,306
Come on, quick!

303
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:35,544
Thank you

304
00:21:37,956 --> 00:21:39,253
You know one thing...

305
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,255
it's not nice to be part of ...

306
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,955
an occupation army.

307
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:45,761
We are forced to live

308
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:47,727
with men that hate us.

309
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:53,069
And we, young men, alone, away from home,

310
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,672
start to court their wives

311
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,638
and girlfriends.

312
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,334
Yes, I understand.

313
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:04,682
Good night, Lieutenant.
I am not afraid anymore.

314
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,146
Please, don't bother.

315
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,617
Good night.

316
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,568
I'd like you to know something,
before I leave:

317
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:35,846
Roberto Ussoni is not my lover.

318
00:22:36,848 --> 00:22:38,315
He is my cousin.

319
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,586
He is the person I admire
the most in the world

320
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:43,677
More than

321
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,052
your husband?

322
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,455
See, my husband and I have

323
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,097
very different opnions
about Austrians

324
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,232
He is wiiling to accept them. He
even ask for favours.

325
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,468
I am like my cousin:

326
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:04,603
a real Italian.

327
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,407
Good night.

328
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:09,611
Countess Serpieri!

329
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:11,143
I am very grateful...

330
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,916
We walked a lot...

331
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:18,315
together...

332
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,819
by the empty streets.

333
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,228
My fear to him had dissappeared.

334
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,664
Time didn't seem to exist

335
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,092
The only thing that existed...

336
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,598
was the unconfessed pleasure...

337
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,297
I felt when he spoke...

338
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:37,202
when he laughed...

339
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:39,975
and when I heard the sound of
our steps,

340
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,747
in that silence city.

341
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,813
Where are we going?

342
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,349
Anywhere you want.

343
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:51,745
The truth is I don't even
know where we are

344
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,783
We are in a god place

345
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:58,128
That is my house

346
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,257
I live there.

347
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:02,294
Alone?

348
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,693
No.

349
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:06,803
Not alone, with other officers.

350
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,805
We usually dressed informally,

351
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:12,033
drink beer
and talk about women.

352
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,345
-But, now everything will change.
-Why?

353
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:17,508
Because I have met you.

354
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:26,483
-What is that?
-A piece of mirror.

355
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:34,855
Why do you look at yourself
in that way?

356
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,794
-Do you enjoy watching yourself that much?
-Yes, I do.

357
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,238
I never walk in front of a mirror

358
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,701
without looking at myself.

359
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,306
Why do you like it that much?

360
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:48,277
To be sure that It's...

361
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,141
...me.

362
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:55,047
It's the only time you are sure to be yourself?

363
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,413
No.

364
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,111
Also, when I see a woman...

365
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:01,224
looking at me the way you are doing right now.

366
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:07,328
"It's the End of the Days

367
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,864
and dead men come to life...

368
00:25:10,502 --> 00:25:12,129
to face eternal glory...

369
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:14,237
or eternal pain.

370
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,870
We keep hugging each other

371
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:19,872
and don't care about nothing else

372
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,376
nor paradise, nor hell."

373
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:25,707
Do you like those verses by Haine?

374
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,009
No.

375
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,780
Why not?

376
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,454
I don't like what it means.

377
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:34,116
It's a shame!

378
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,360
The imminence of a war...

379
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,529
Do you think ther will be a war?

380
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,924
Oh, yes.

381
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:42,900
Even though is inconceivable...

382
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:45,695
that people can kill themselves
for things they don't even care about.

383
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,463
Do you believe in wars?

384
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:52,702
I do believe that the freedom of
a nation...

385
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,376
must be defended...

386
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,274
even by sacrificing freedom itself

387
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:57,641
or life.

388
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,979
Then, we are enemies,
isn't that so?

389
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:09,526
I don't think so

390
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:12,496
I...

391
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:15,325
suppose it's a big mistake...

392
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:17,929
not to be interested...

393
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,228
in war...

394
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:20,461
in politics...

395
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:23,266
in territorial exchanges and occupations.

396
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:25,238
in all that serious things..

397
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:28,037
that men are willing to die for .

398
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,179
You see, I think that...

399
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:32,849
the fact that some men were born...

400
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:35,219
on the side of that river

401
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,848
and other men in the side of that mountain...

402
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:40,021
doesn't mean that God had made
rivers and mountains

403
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,092
to separate people.

404
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:45,796
You speak like a child.

405
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:49,860
I don't understand how that way of thinking
makes you a militar

406
00:26:50,802 --> 00:26:53,669
It's ridiculous you are an officer

407
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,405
I agree with you.

408
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:58,066
It's ridiculous

409
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,712
Everything is very ridiculous

410
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:07,144
I have to leave now.

411
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,109
There's almost daylight.

412
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:11,379
Livia...

413
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,055
That is your name, right?

414
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:14,583
Yes

415
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,720
When can I see you again?

416
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:19,920
-Tomorrow?
-That's impossible!

417
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,130
I will wait.

418
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:35,342
It was almost morning.

419
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,039
The city was coming back to life...

420
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:43,415
and then I felt ashamed.

421
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,784
How could I had spent the entire night...

422
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:49,425
with an stranger!

423
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:52,660
An Austrian officer!

424
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,667
Me, an Italian married woman.

425
00:27:57,702 --> 00:28:01,194
A woman that never care for
frivolities.

426
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:09,312
However, after four days,

427
00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:15,351
four days waiting to see him,

428
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:19,617
it was me who was running to see him.

429
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,771
I convinced myself ...

430
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:43,447
that he was the only one who can save Roberto.

431
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:46,216
And it was my duty
to ask him for help.

432
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,597
Hey! Do you want to play?

433
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:11,092
I've waited for you days and days...

434
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,867
and you finally came.

435
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:39,191
We don't care for anything,
nor paradise, nor hell!

436
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:56,242
Since that day, we see each other
frequently.

437
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:59,347
We met in a room

438
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,383
that Franz rented at la Fondamenta Nuove.

439
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:04,651
You must realize.

440
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:08,688
that in rooms like these
there are always little noises:

441
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,395
the movement of a courtain

442
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:15,595
the buzz of a fly hitting the window.

443
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,031
Have you notice it?

444
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,371
No, Franz.

445
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:29,336
You'll notice it later, in the memories.

446
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,842
Just then, you'll realize what you heard..

447
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:35,542
all the time we have been together.

448
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,813
Is that so, Franz?

449
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,856
By remembering, all we heard continously

450
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,828
will be discovered

451
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:46,687
It's afterwards...

452
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:56,863
that those little details become important.

453
00:31:57,942 --> 00:31:59,432
A detail...

454
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:02,203
is so important

455
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,038
The sensation of adventure is

456
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,983
as important as...

457
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:08,912
As what?

458
00:32:10,688 --> 00:32:11,950
As the color.

459
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:15,517
the perfume of her sweet hair,

460
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:18,019
over the pillow.

461
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,832
Have you ever realized that my love?

462
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:30,907
No, Franz. Not until now.

463
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh! I always forget...

464
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:36,373
What?

465
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:40,074
I always forget...

466
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:42,946
that for Countess Serpieri,
there's no past.

467
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,255
It's just the present

468
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,320
or the future.

469
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:50,858
Just the present, Franz.

470
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:53,228
Just the present?

471
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:55,665
Not tomorrow?

472
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:05,870
Can you give me that comb?

473
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:08,304
Yes.

474
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,308
Franz, if someone told me

475
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:18,751
that there's only present,
that there won't be a tomorrow...

476
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,925
that it will never be a tomorrow
after this moment

477
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:24,995
I would feel...

478
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,992
as if a Doctor
had told me...

479
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:28,858
"You are about to die...

480
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,635
you only have a few minutes of life left".

481
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:42,369
And I know it is true

482
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,844
There's only the present.
The present, Franz.

483
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:50,951
Without a future

484
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,551
Everytime you left, you said:

485
00:33:55,526 --> 00:33:57,016
"Goodbye, Franz.

486
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:58,987
We won't see each other again".

487
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:03,556
But I keep on waiting for you
faithfully.

488
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,760
You might think you
won't see me,

489
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,701
but I will be always here
waiting for you.

490
00:34:13,544 --> 00:34:15,842
Maybe you will.

491
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,056
But you had lived so many
adventures

492
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:31,924
in those rooms, where you had heard

493
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:35,159
the buzz of a fly hitting the window, the sound of a courtain

494
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:38,697
Those sounds that you remember afterwards

495
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:41,938
Then you had waken up

496
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,534
and liberated that trapped insect,

497
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:49,745
with the same elegance
you liberate yourself from the heart of a woman.

498
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,081
But don't worry.

499
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:58,420
in this adventure...

500
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,625
you don't have to bother at all.

501
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,055
I will do it for you, Franz.

502
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,560
I will wake up from the bed,

503
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,291
open the window,

504
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:16,036
and liberate your heart
as a butterfly

505
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:20,003
Would you please pass me
those hairpins?

506
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:24,710
I'm sorry, Madam. But you musn't forget
that I am not at your service.

507
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,482
You'll have to pick up the hairpins
yourself

508
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,422
Franz,

509
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,932
take this as a present to remember me by.

510
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,639
What a beatiful medallion!

511
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,406
Here, on your heart.

512
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,117
Now, I'm leaving

513
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:37,313
I'm leaving

514
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,250
Goodbye

515
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,422
Goodbye

516
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:49,893
Franz...

517
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:53,202
-Franz, are you letting me leave this way?
-No, my love,..

518
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,030
I knew you wouldn't leave like that

519
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,210
One afternoon

520
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:09,909
I spent waiting for him,
in that room,

521
00:37:10,254 --> 00:37:12,620
I realized, frightend,
for the first time,

522
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:15,552
that I didn't control my feelings,

523
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,318
as I have always believed

524
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,098
I have to leave from a moment,
and there's no one home.

525
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:25,565
What shall I do? Shall I leave
the door open or you'd open?

526
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,228
Are you sure that

527
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,497
that the Lieutenant
didn't let me a message?

528
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,237
-A letter?
-I'm sure, Madam

529
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,567
Perhaps you went out

530
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:35,507
and there's no one at home.

531
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,647
What do you want me to tell you?
He must have left.

532
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,247
A Captain

533
00:37:39,483 --> 00:37:40,507
that came often

534
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:42,208
was suddenly trasnsfered
to some other place

535
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,409
By the way, Madam

536
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,612
Do you know someone who can help me?

537
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:46,915
Do you know what they want to do?

538
00:37:47,124 --> 00:37:49,718
They want to confiscate my house,
because I lodge officers.

539
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:52,327
Can you believe it? As if this
were a headquarter!

540
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,589
Madam, I hope you can help me.

541
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,232
I also mean this for you, you know?

542
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:58,459
I know you can do it all, Countess

543
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:00,501
I know you pretty well

544
00:38:00,705 --> 00:38:03,367
I have a sister
that have worked for years...

545
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:06,871
What? Are you leaving?
What if the sir returns?

546
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:10,842
Listen,  Countess...

547
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:13,982
What if the Lieutenat
had really left?

548
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,082
Who is going to pay me?

549
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:18,983
I've never said anything,
because I know you well, but...

550
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:21,748
you must understand all the hard work,
my lady

551
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,256
Thank you very much, madam.
That's much better.

552
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:01,957
Excuse me...

553
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,997
Is Lieutenant Mahler
at home?

554
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:09,267
Is he in Venice?

555
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,535
Yes, he is in Venice

556
00:39:12,676 --> 00:39:14,234
Do you know if he's going to come back?

557
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:15,977
I don't know that, madam.

558
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,246
-I'll wait.
-Please.

559
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:28,421
Sit down, miss.

560
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,456
Do you like our place?

561
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:44,101
She doesn't say she likes it...
but she comes anyway.

562
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:50,072
The trousers...

563
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:52,942
the shirts...

564
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:55,842
two shirts...

565
00:39:57,154 --> 00:39:58,587
and two bed sheets.

566
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:01,648
Here it is!

567
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:04,359
My Lord will go tomorrow
to pay the bills

568
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:05,688
Listen Lieutenant,

569
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,729
-Didn't he tell you where he was going?
-How could I possibly know,

570
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:10,298
...since he hasn't came last night?

571
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:11,763
Has he been out

572
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:15,172
-All night?
-Not all night

573
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,135
But, didn't he return in the morning?
Didn't you see him?

574
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:20,674
I didn't. Maybe he went to Katia's...

575
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,038
or Nena's.

576
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:29,284
Why are you laughing?

577
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:35,682
Well, if you want to wait,
stay.

578
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,625
But, are you sure he's not near?

579
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:42,163
-Perhaps in the headquarters
-I'm sure he's not anywhere near.

580
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,967
I guarantee it.

581
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:46,436
And that's the only thing
I can guarantee.

582
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,504
But, if you are patient...

583
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:51,770
and since you are a friend of Franz,
I'm sure you are.

584
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:54,304
Ludwig says he left
Franz an hour ago

585
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:56,412
They were playing bililards.

586
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,411
But we don't know where
he might have gone

587
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:00,740
Why don't you just shut your mouth?

588
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,378
Don't listen to him.

589
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:06,282
He doesn't know what he is saying

590
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:09,656
Why don't you just sit down?

591
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,219
Franz will be back soon.

592
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:15,955
Though we don't know
what he does or where he goes

593
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,965
He's always around...

594
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:19,692
without a direction.

595
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:22,564
What can we do?
That's the way he is!

596
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,703
We used to live togheter...

597
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,400
for three months,
in the same apartment.

598
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,176
In Innsbruck.

599
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:34,183
I spent the days, attending
girls that visited him.

600
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:37,750
And, even when he was home
he didn't want to see him.

601
00:41:45,062 --> 00:41:46,359
- Countess!
-What do you want?

602
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:47,963
-We are leaving!
-Who has ordered that?

603
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:50,360
The Count has ordered
to prepare the luggage.

604
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:52,593
You must have misunderstood him

605
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,129
What is going on?

606
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:06,282
You could have told me!

607
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:08,379
Or I'm not important here?

608
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,310
Prussians have occupied
the Austrian Holstein.

609
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:13,387
That means that
the war has begun.

610
00:42:13,591 --> 00:42:14,785
I think we better leave

611
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:16,459
That's impossible!

612
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:20,560
In that way, so soon?

613
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:24,291
-What do you want?
-Receive orders from the Countess.

614
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:26,899
There's time, Laura.
There's time.

615
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,367
My husband's decision scared me...

616
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,670
but I convinced him...

617
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:38,143
to delay our trip,
at least for 24 hours.

618
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:28,963
Lieutenant Mahler, please,
Eighth Battalion.

619
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,828
They are not here anymore, madam.

620
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:34,470
They are at the Misericordia headquarters.

621
00:44:18,148 --> 00:44:21,015
Oh, Countess! I was going to
bring you the umbrella.

622
00:44:21,218 --> 00:44:22,981
The Count sent me.

623
00:44:23,187 --> 00:44:26,020
But I didn't know where to go. My lady didn't
tell me where she was going.

624
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:29,056
I'll be at the house of Countess Marcello,
or at the Marquese...

625
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:31,318
You are so wet!
What a weather!

626
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:33,962
It doesn't look like Summer
Even the wind is insane.

627
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:35,358
It's because of the war

628
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:37,659
I remember vividly
that in 59...

629
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:40,632
The Count was worried

630
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:43,068
He must have been busy,
you know, with the travel.

631
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:47,138
A men came to see you.
Someone I never met before.

632
00:44:47,544 --> 00:44:49,739
No, I didn't tell anything to the Count.

633
00:44:49,947 --> 00:44:54,043
He told me is urgent,
He said you have to see him right away.

634
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,015
You must go to 349 Plaza San Jeremías
and call at the door three times...

635
00:44:58,288 --> 00:45:00,279
-When did he come? Who was him?
-I don't know him

636
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,459
The Countess had just left,
as I said before

637
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,183
He wanted to look for you

638
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:06,362
I'll be right back. Give me the umbrella

639
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,494
What should I tell the Count?

640
00:45:10,734 --> 00:45:12,964
Whatever you want!
I don't care!

641
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:16,400
I don't care at all, you know
Tell him everything

642
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:18,668
Tell him!

643
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:19,400
It's not necessary to follow me and to spy me.

644
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,962
I would tell you myself.
I don't want to keep on lying.

645
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:25,174
It's true. I have a lover

646
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:28,034
And I love him, and I want to
live with him. Do you understand?

647
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:32,509
Livia! Finally!
We were waiting for you. Come in!

648
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:36,513
Livia!

649
00:46:41,692 --> 00:46:43,990
Livia! I'm so glad!
Finally!

650
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:47,728
Ah, it's you! I didn't know
you came back.

651
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,291
You could have told us

652
00:46:56,006 --> 00:46:59,066
Livia, we crossed the borders
this night.

653
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:01,301
I need to contact my friends
in Venice

654
00:47:01,511 --> 00:47:03,138
There's no time to loose
Besides, considering how things are...

655
00:47:03,347 --> 00:47:05,042
Why haven't you trust me?

656
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:08,351
You wanted to make me believe...

657
00:47:08,552 --> 00:47:10,110
You can't understand...

658
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,981
You can't understand.

659
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:23,532
I talked with Livia clearly.

660
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:27,261
I guess I must tell you
what I already told her

661
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:31,136
I have no intention
to accept the position...

662
00:47:31,341 --> 00:47:33,468
that recently and
insistencely..

663
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:35,611
the Austrian government has offered me.

664
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:39,279
I was born in Venice, I grew up here

665
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:42,042
And you know perfectly that all my assets

666
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:44,345
and affections are in this city

667
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,957
And it's clear that whatever the results
of this war were,

668
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,752
Venice will certainly go to the
Italian government

669
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:53,361
The Emperor of France
has garanteed it himself

670
00:47:53,563 --> 00:47:55,326
Considering this,

671
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:56,794
I want to help you.

672
00:47:57,467 --> 00:47:59,492
You can trust me.

673
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:02,869
As you see, my proposition
is very practical

674
00:48:03,073 --> 00:48:06,042
and is not dictated by
ideals and enthusiasm..

675
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:07,733
which I don't believe in.

676
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:09,737
I understand

677
00:48:10,147 --> 00:48:11,739
And what do you want in exchange?

678
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:16,645
I already told you: something
very simple

679
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:18,445
I want to stay, no matter what,
in my country

680
00:48:19,423 --> 00:48:22,358
-I can't promise you anything.
-OK.

681
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,851
But, in time
you can testify in my favour.

682
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,659
((...a ring with a jewel))

683
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:36,300
A golden chain
with a clock...

684
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,829
Livia,

685
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:40,802
Are you willing to leave tomorrow
early to Aldano?

686
00:48:41,078 --> 00:48:42,340
It couldn't be better for me.

687
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:44,544
I've been telling this to
Livia for days...

688
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:47,582
It's been my fault. I wanted to
wait for you

689
00:48:50,587 --> 00:48:51,554
I was sure...

690
00:48:53,156 --> 00:48:54,350
you came back.

691
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,326
It's OK, Livia...

692
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,489
but we can't loose more time

693
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:03,700
I'm also leaving Venice tomorrow.

694
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:07,161
I will try to reach the Italian headquarters.

695
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:09,862
They will instruct me
with the recruiting of volunteers.

696
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:12,198
The contacts, as I'll explain to you later,
are well organized

697
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,343
Luca is already in Aldano.

698
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:18,380
In four or five days,
I'll be there, if everything goes fine.

699
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:23,146
You have to take the money,
if there are no inconvenients for you.

700
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:26,249
Give me that Andrea! They need it

701
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:29,084
Our volunteers live from charity,
like hermits.

702
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:30,823
It's a big amount.

703
00:49:31,395 --> 00:49:33,556
Certainly, you might had help with
the contribution.

704
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:35,057
No...!

705
00:49:47,878 --> 00:49:49,937
We've been waiting so long
for this moment to come.

706
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:52,674
And it seems as if ...

707
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:55,044
it surprises you, doesn't it?

708
00:49:55,385 --> 00:49:56,852
What a thing!

709
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:01,323
Each one of us must act...

710
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:04,221
as if the lifes of all the combatants
depend on us.

711
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:07,463
We don't have rights anymore
Livia,

712
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:08,993
just duties.

713
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:12,058
We must forget about ourselves.

714
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:14,863
I'm not afraid to sound rethoric.
Italia is at war

715
00:50:15,272 --> 00:50:16,603
Our war!

716
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,507
Our revolution!

717
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:36,081
Roberto's words...

718
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,283
and his confidence...

719
00:50:39,196 --> 00:50:41,494
help me walk away.

720
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:45,796
The first days...

721
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,835
I spent in our quiet
villa in Aldano...

722
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:50,930
made me remember...

723
00:50:51,374 --> 00:50:52,739
the recovery...

724
00:50:52,943 --> 00:50:55,844
after a child illness.

725
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,596
-Laura!¡Laura!
-Yes, I'll open. A minute

726
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,136
Somebody is there!

727
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:27,139
Dogs have started to bark.

728
00:51:27,344 --> 00:51:29,403
I saw someone walking around there.
Is the window open?

729
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:31,342
-I haven't heard anything.
-I'm sure that..

730
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:33,743
Stop the noise!
The Countess is sleeping.

731
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:39,777
Who's that?

732
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,580
It's me Laura.

733
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:45,919
What's wrong?

734
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,393
I'm sorry, Countess.

735
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:50,160
The guard says...

736
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:54,562
Yes?

737
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:57,906
he saw somebody in the balcony.

738
00:52:08,885 --> 00:52:11,183
Countess!

739
00:52:16,393 --> 00:52:18,691
He says there's someone
in the balcony.

740
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:20,428
Yes, it was me.

741
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:22,523
-But, are you insane?
-Yes, I went insane in Venice,

742
00:52:22,832 --> 00:52:25,426
when you left. Is the door
closed?

743
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:26,758
Oh! The door...

744
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,201
-Laura?
-Yes, Countess.

745
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:33,534
It was me

746
00:52:34,344 --> 00:52:35,868
Go to your room.

747
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,239
That stupid!

748
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:39,472
How can he bother people like that?

749
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:45,386
-Have they seen me?
-How could you do that?

750
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:47,051
How could you?

751
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:55,287
Why are there so many dogs?
To defend yourself from the enemies...

752
00:52:55,498 --> 00:52:56,863
or from lovers?

753
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,495
Why are you here, Franz?

754
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:01,837
I just wanted to come.

755
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:07,040
Suddenly I felt the need to see you.

756
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:08,541
That's why I am here

757
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:10,339
Livia!

758
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:12,073
Livia!

759
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:18,749
Do you prefer that your dogs eat me?

760
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,618
No!

761
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:24,384
No! No!

762
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:27,994
In the back!

763
00:53:28,198 --> 00:53:29,665
Hide there!

764
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,900
Quickly!

765
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:53,249
I don't believe...

766
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:56,616
you risk your life just to see me

767
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:00,185
I would've believe you before.
Not now.

768
00:54:01,131 --> 00:54:02,291
Before...

769
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:04,865
those dates you never arrived

770
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:09,864
Before those awful days...

771
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,038
I couldn't reach you

772
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:18,075
I am younger than you
Countess Serpieri...

773
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:21,940
and I'm not that wise as I seem.

774
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:26,654
When I realized that I felt in love with...

775
00:54:28,124 --> 00:54:30,615
a woman that will never
able to love me...

776
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:33,723
I thought I must dissapear.
That's why...

777
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:35,557
you didn't see me againd.

778
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:38,400
But it was useless.

779
00:54:38,768 --> 00:54:39,928
when I realized...

780
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:42,036
that it was you was running away...

781
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:43,863
that you left Venice...

782
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:46,371
There's only one thing in my mind:
To see you again.

783
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:52,275
There must be another reason
I don't understand.

784
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,380
Is there any other reason

785
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:57,052
a man risk his life to come here?

786
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,748
Don't you realize?
We are at war!

787
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:02,785
At war!

788
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:06,791
I'm so tired...

789
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,225
I just want to look at you,
be with you-

790
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:12,799
I just came for that,
I don't want to think of anything else.

791
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:21,410
I could have believe you before!

792
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:24,903
If you don't believe me,
I'd better go.

793
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:26,580
No, wait!

794
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:28,509
Wait!

795
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:45,292
Franz?

796
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,402
Don't laugh, Franz!

797
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:55,302
Franz?

798
00:55:55,779 --> 00:55:57,269
-¡Stay here!
-Here?

799
00:55:57,981 --> 00:55:59,243
-Fine.
-Please

800
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:01,380
Don't make noises.

801
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:03,150
I beg you.

802
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:04,843
Wait!

803
00:56:30,547 --> 00:56:33,072
-Countess!
-Countess, what's going on?

804
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:35,482
Shut up, stupid!

805
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:40,113
Ah! Countess.

806
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:42,223
It's so scary!

807
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:45,223
I couldn't sleep all night because of the fear.

808
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:48,289
-It was you in the balcony?
-Simone!

809
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:52,935
Search everywhere!
Try to find some trace!

810
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:59,539
Be careful! Maybe he is
in the garden.

811
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:03,369
Great Simone! Keep on
searching

812
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:08,081
Do you need me, Countess?

813
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:10,610
No!

814
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:12,616
No, I don't need you

815
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:16,025
-Go! Go to bed.
-Keep looking.

816
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:19,526
He must run away, when he heard the
dogs.

817
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,724
-I am going to bed.
-Good night, Count.

818
00:57:30,006 --> 00:57:31,166
I am sorry.

819
00:57:35,144 --> 00:57:36,736
You must forgive me

820
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:47,382
We are not in Venice anymore

821
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:50,052
I have changed

822
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,889
I have no option but think things over.
I recover my lucidity.

823
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:05,037
-Livia, listen, my love
-No! We are not in Venice anymore.

824
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:08,637
You made me...

825
00:58:09,212 --> 00:58:11,271
lost modesty

826
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:12,641
and dignity

827
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:14,714
-But, why...
-Yes. That's true. Dignity

828
00:58:15,852 --> 00:58:19,515
lost by a sad and guilty love

829
00:58:21,658 --> 00:58:23,785
full of shame.

830
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:29,758
Livia, my love...

831
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:37,204
We are not in Venice anymore.

832
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:41,875
It's fine. We are not in Venice.

833
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:44,369
We agree on that

834
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:54,491
May I sit down?

835
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:57,254
Yes. You cant' leave...

836
00:58:58,066 --> 00:59:00,933
before the dogs are chained

837
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:03,297
Thank you

838
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:14,806
I'm so sleepy...

839
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,412
I haven't slept in three nights

840
00:59:26,728 --> 00:59:28,958
I like the smell of the summer

841
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:33,031
I like the smell of the
piled up wheat

842
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:36,731
Here the smell is intense

843
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,207
I am so tired

844
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:43,643
There's a sweet perfume in the air

845
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:50,444
What did you say?

846
00:59:53,855 --> 00:59:55,846
The dogs had been chained

847
00:59:59,995 --> 01:00:02,520
Your voice is so delicate

848
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:04,560
I can't understand what you're saying

849
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:07,792
Have I heard the wrong thing?

850
01:00:08,837 --> 01:00:10,532
I thought you said

851
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,939
said

852
01:00:13,942 --> 01:00:14,966
Franz...

853
01:00:16,645 --> 01:00:18,010
my dear Franz...

854
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:21,246
I'm so lonely

855
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,808
please

856
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,216
stay with me

857
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,216
You heard the wrong thing

858
01:00:35,163 --> 01:00:36,187
I'm sorry

859
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,100
I misunderstood you

860
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:45,204
I said you must leave

861
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:49,408
Must leave,
must leave

862
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:51,506
What are you saying mow?

863
01:00:52,547 --> 01:00:55,448
I said there's no danger at all

864
01:00:56,652 --> 01:00:58,017
You can leave now

865
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:00,383
How long

866
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:04,248
...how long haven't we seen
each other, my love?

867
01:01:06,094 --> 01:01:07,789
I've dreamed of you telling me that...

868
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:10,562
I told you to leave

869
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:13,457
leave, leave, leave

870
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:17,571
Are you really saying that?

871
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:20,908
Is that what you want?

872
01:01:23,912 --> 01:01:25,573
I thought you were going to ask
me to stay.

873
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:38,584
Franz...

874
01:01:39,494 --> 01:01:40,688
Franz...

875
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:46,695
Yes, Franz...

876
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:52,439
please, stay

877
01:02:25,974 --> 01:02:27,168
Franz...

878
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:31,872
Franz...my love.

879
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:41,220
It's already sunrise

880
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:44,753
and you told me you have to be
in Verona before sunset.

881
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:49,523
Who are you?

882
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:52,961
It's me, Livia.

883
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:56,829
Franz!

884
01:02:57,072 --> 01:02:58,505
Wake up! It's already the morning

885
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:00,308
What do you say?

886
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:03,067
You must leave soon.

887
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,474
The sun is coming up...

888
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:07,408
and if they see you...

889
01:03:09,951 --> 01:03:11,213
Close your eyes

890
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:16,288
-I haven't closed them all night.
-Why?

891
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,294
I've been watching you
while you were sleeping.

892
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,392
That's why I had slept so well

893
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:31,605
I dreamt I was at home

894
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:33,632
I was a child

895
01:03:33,842 --> 01:03:35,810
and play a soldier
with a wood sword

896
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:00,832
-I have to go.
-I wish you could stay

897
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,637
I wish

898
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:04,203
-I could...
-Could?

899
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:07,935
I wish I could stay...

900
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:10,671
embraced to you, as tonight,...

901
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:12,446
for all my life

902
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:19,378
Good bye, my love.

903
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:21,385
-I must leave
-No!

904
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,590
The sun is coming up
It's already too late

905
01:04:25,427 --> 01:04:28,123
You don't want them to see me
descending by your balcony, do you?

906
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,456
No, no!

907
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:32,124
Not yet

908
01:04:34,102 --> 01:04:35,535
I'll hide you

909
01:04:36,371 --> 01:04:37,929
I'll have you

910
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:39,367
one more day

911
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:43,175
Another day with me. Wait!
Wait

912
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:45,845
Let's go fast

913
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:57,723
Come, fast

914
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:32,526
Livia!

915
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,686
Stay with me for a little while

916
01:05:35,897 --> 01:05:38,422
No, the maid must find me
in my bedroom

917
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,223
It's too early. There's time

918
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:41,902
Don't speak so loud

919
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:51,335
I'll say no more

920
01:05:52,747 --> 01:05:54,647
You know, this is not that bad

921
01:05:57,452 --> 01:05:59,079
I's stay here forever

922
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:02,247
Then, why don't you stay?

923
01:06:02,657 --> 01:06:04,284
Have you forgotten I must go to war...

924
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:07,222
-in order to be a hero?
-No ¡No!

925
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:09,620
Try to forget

926
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,261
I wish I could

927
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:13,959
Really

928
01:06:17,205 --> 01:06:19,571
A friend of mine did something unbelievable

929
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:21,238
Who?

930
01:06:22,877 --> 01:06:24,139
A friend

931
01:06:25,146 --> 01:06:26,374
An officer

932
01:06:27,415 --> 01:06:28,746
What did he do?

933
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:31,543
He bribed a doctor

934
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,311
and he was discharged
from the Army for medical reasons

935
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:38,119
He made a medical exam,

936
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:40,292
and, following my friend's orders,

937
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:42,463
he found a
heart failure

938
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:46,128
that a calm life and rest

939
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,068
And so, he was sent

940
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:50,333
home, with a license

941
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:52,398
How is that possible?

942
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:54,768
I told you. He paid a lot
of money to a doctor

943
01:06:57,312 --> 01:06:59,405
I didn't know those things
were possible at all

944
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:01,742
But, after all

945
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,976
the men from our generation, are like
spoiled children

946
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:07,048
We love elegant uniforms

947
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:09,052
because we look well wearing them

948
01:07:09,324 --> 01:07:10,291
Golden galloons,

949
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:12,585
shinny medals,
the sound of the band...

950
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:15,356
that escorts our walk.

951
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:19,696
And, there's the other side of the coin:

952
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:22,131
being away from our women,

953
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:24,365
hunger,

954
01:07:24,606 --> 01:07:26,904
coldness, fatigue.

955
01:07:27,642 --> 01:07:29,439
Yes, when it comes to

956
01:07:29,644 --> 01:07:31,077
toasting for our future victories...

957
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:32,803
, everybody would be willing

958
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:35,983
But we don't want to pay the cost...

959
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:38,049
of this victory

960
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,446
Losing an arm

961
01:07:39,654 --> 01:07:41,315
-...a leg..
-Stop it!

962
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:43,684
A horribly disfigured face

963
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:46,417
-Or something worst...
-No, Franz, no!

964
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:52,990
Why not? That's war!

965
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:55,202
Thousands and thousands of men...

966
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:57,530
ready to kill
themselves, just for the sake of it:

967
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,798
no final purpose, no reason

968
01:08:00,408 --> 01:08:02,842
Reason has nothing to do
with wars

969
01:08:04,512 --> 01:08:05,843
That's war:

970
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:07,344
a confortable method...

971
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:09,449
to force men
to act and think...

972
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:12,142
in the most convenient way
for the rulers.

973
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:15,679
Why don't you speak, dear?

974
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:17,748
What are you thinking?

975
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,350
It's awful! War is awful.

976
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:28,962
I'll come back, as soon
as I can

977
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,854
Last night, a lot of troops
had passed around here.

978
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:54,028
Even heavy artillery.
All the house was trembling!

979
01:08:54,329 --> 01:08:56,729
They are coming from Insbruck
in their way to Verona.

980
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:58,694
-Ah! They are going to Verona...
-Count!

981
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,992
Sir...

982
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:01,896
Should I dennounce
the episode of last night?

983
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:03,161
We'd better not.

984
01:09:03,371 --> 01:09:05,100
I bet someone is spying on us
because of the wheat...

985
01:09:05,306 --> 01:09:07,399
and want to cause troubles.

986
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:09,434
None of the men have spoken.
They'd better not

987
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:11,373
-Everyone is compromised.
-Anyway, someone...

988
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:13,444
must guard this at night

989
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:17,415
Look! Isn't that Le Ronghe?

990
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:19,610
Yes, it's Le Ronghe.
What a fire!

991
01:09:20,088 --> 01:09:21,146
It's Le Ronghe!

992
01:09:21,356 --> 01:09:22,983
A fire! It's so big!

993
01:09:23,191 --> 01:09:24,249
Let's see!

994
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:27,088
Look, Count...

995
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:29,092
a dense cloud of smoke,
Over there

996
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:31,390
It looks like
the barn is burning.

997
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:34,397
We must send someone!
Inmediately!

998
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:36,660
It's in Le Ronghe! Le Ronghe!

999
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:38,463
Look how that is burning!

1000
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:40,140
It looks like the house in Mancini.

1001
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:43,310
No! It's the house after the hill!

1002
01:09:43,578 --> 01:09:44,738
It's so far away!

1003
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:46,811
I guess it's the
estables in Piovenne.

1004
01:09:52,086 --> 01:09:54,213
Come on! Let's see from the barn.

1005
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:56,784
Maybe someone is burning underbrush

1006
01:09:56,991 --> 01:09:59,289
Can't you see, Countess,
that big cloud of smoke?

1007
01:09:59,494 --> 01:10:01,291
That's preciselu Mancini's house!

1008
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:02,929
Yes, I can see clearly from here.

1009
01:10:04,232 --> 01:10:06,063
Maybe it's a military camp.

1010
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:09,293
We'd better watch.
You two, come with me!

1011
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:19,405
This shouldn't have happened!
Let's go to the window.

1012
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,141
How did you come here?
How?

1013
01:10:25,019 --> 01:10:27,715
Laura. Isn't that the
name of the maid?

1014
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:31,887
I thought you sent her.

1015
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,451
Extraodinary! She looked for me...

1016
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:36,687
brought me here and
gave me something to eat.

1017
01:10:39,133 --> 01:10:40,600
How does Laura know you're here?

1018
01:10:40,802 --> 01:10:41,860
What's wrong with that?

1019
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:44,061
Maids are for those sort of things,
aren't they?

1020
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:52,542
Countess, the Count
is looking for you!

1021
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:10,094
We are leaving!
Don't expect me for dinner

1022
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:11,724
That's fine!

1023
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:13,491
What?

1024
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:14,963
I said that's fine!

1025
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,133
Excuse me, Lady Countess.

1026
01:11:17,472 --> 01:11:18,598
Good bye!

1027
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:51,929
What's on your mind?

1028
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:55,667
I was thinking about something.

1029
01:11:59,947 --> 01:12:01,175
Tell me what it is.

1030
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:09,851
This morning in the barn...

1031
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:13,952
you told me about this friend of yours...

1032
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:16,656
that was sent home...

1033
01:12:17,432 --> 01:12:20,629
because the doctors
found a heart failure.

1034
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:22,060
Yes, and?

1035
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,402
Couldn't you do the same?

1036
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:34,646
Me?

1037
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:37,516
Yes, Franz, you.

1038
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:39,946
Do you want me to
start faking a limp?

1039
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,951
to bribe a scoundrel...

1040
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:44,124
or to pass a sick person?

1041
01:12:45,827 --> 01:12:46,953
Yes

1042
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,730
Do you think...

1043
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:53,597
I am able...

1044
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:55,769
to do such despicable acts?

1045
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,938
Besides, it's not just that...

1046
01:13:09,517 --> 01:13:10,984
A lot of money is needed.

1047
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,553
How much?

1048
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:33,234
2.000 florins.

1049
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:38,876
2.000 florins? That's impossinñe!

1050
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:43,942
-Is it more than I worth?
-Only if I could...

1051
01:13:44,152 --> 01:13:45,881
if there were a way.

1052
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:48,184
Ypu could stay here,
near me...

1053
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:50,914
-maybe in Trento, no?
-No, no!

1054
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:54,289
The regulations clearly say
that the disabled officer...

1055
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:56,520
must stay near his
own regiment

1056
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:58,756
Franz, Franz!

1057
01:14:00,468 --> 01:14:03,869
-Franz, If I could...
-I must leave

1058
01:14:04,071 --> 01:14:05,595
If I'm not back in
Venecia by tomorrow...

1059
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,105
-I will be declared a deserter.
-No!

1060
01:14:08,309 --> 01:14:09,742
They might even execute me!

1061
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:12,037
That way, all od our troubles
will be resolved

1062
01:14:12,246 --> 01:14:15,409
-I can't stay any longer!
-Wait! Wait, Franz!

1063
01:14:18,019 --> 01:14:19,145
Wait

1064
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:54,851
Close the door!

1065
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:56,647
Come here, quickly!

1066
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:05,995
-My dear, is this yours?
-No, no.

1067
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,167
-Your husband's?
-No, no.

1068
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:08,494
Who's this, then?

1069
01:15:09,437 --> 01:15:11,769
I can't tell you!
You'd think I'm crazy!

1070
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,536
And I am! I am crazy!

1071
01:15:17,044 --> 01:15:20,309
Oh, my dear! My dear love!

1072
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:23,780
My poor and desperate love!

1073
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,014
My treasure...

1074
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:28,381
my treasure...

1075
01:15:28,589 --> 01:15:31,786
my poor and desperate love.

1076
01:15:32,527 --> 01:15:33,653
Who is it?

1077
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:35,328
It's me, Countess,
May I?

1078
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,622
Don't come in!

1079
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:39,090
Don't!

1080
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:40,732
But Countess, I just...

1081
01:15:40,968 --> 01:15:42,526
I said no!

1082
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:45,302
Did you count it?

1083
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:47,468
Do you think it's enough?

1084
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:49,742
Livia, I know you gave me
your heart...

1085
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:51,634
and not only yours.

1086
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:58,214
By accepting this, I won't
feel guilty

1087
01:15:58,419 --> 01:16:00,410
I'd feel guilty,
If I wouldn't accept it.

1088
01:16:00,621 --> 01:16:01,883
Do you believe me?

1089
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:04,348
Countess! Countess!

1090
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,218
Countess...

1091
01:16:07,428 --> 01:16:09,953
-The Count is about to return.
-Yes. That's fine.

1092
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:11,153
Tonio just saw him in the
town..

1093
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:13,265
-and I told him...
-Yes, yes...

1094
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:14,934
I told Tonio
to wait in the kitchen.

1095
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:16,899
I called the gardiner too, with a pretext.

1096
01:16:17,104 --> 01:16:19,038
The terrace must be avoid

1097
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,037
because Ada is doing the laundry.

1098
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:22,800
I tried to call her, but

1099
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:26,470
Luca came.

1100
01:16:27,048 --> 01:16:28,572
He is in the living room

1101
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:30,678
-He is waiting.
-Yes! That's fine!

1102
01:16:57,612 --> 01:17:00,547
Write me as soon as you can,
please.

1103
01:17:01,549 --> 01:17:03,483
I wrote some signs in 
this paper

1104
01:17:04,051 --> 01:17:05,848
You gave the letter to any civilian

1105
01:17:06,053 --> 01:17:07,577
It must be sent to Luca.

1106
01:17:07,955 --> 01:17:09,582
They will deliver it right away

1107
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,455
-I must hear from you!
-Yes, I'll write.

1108
01:17:12,693 --> 01:17:14,354
Do it, as soon as you can

1109
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:18,591
Go, now

1110
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:22,231
Tell me when everyting is settled,
Call me,

1111
01:17:22,436 --> 01:17:24,199
so I can meet you.

1112
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:27,572
I can't live like that

1113
01:17:28,876 --> 01:17:30,741
You shouldn't love me!

1114
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:35,281
No one should!

1115
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:49,786
I depended on him

1116
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,690
For him, I forgot...

1117
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:56,227
and betrayed all the people
that were fighting..

1118
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:58,995
trying to achieve...

1119
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:02,532
what they've been dreaming
for so long.

1120
01:18:30,504 --> 01:18:31,801
Marquis de Ussoni!

1121
01:18:33,607 --> 01:18:36,633
I recommend you to 
meet our troops.

1122
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:38,505
When you leave the quarters...

1123
01:18:38,946 --> 01:18:41,972
you will find a lot of trouble.
It won't be easy.

1124
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:45,313
Thank you

1125
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,745
Good luck, Marquis..

1126
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:27,493
Stop!

1127
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:04,650
What is the best way to Orione?

1128
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:08,226
All the ways are blocked...

1129
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:09,691
There's fighting everywhere

1130
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:11,455
Try to go by the mountain.

1131
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:12,833
Turn left.

1132
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:14,660
you will find a farm.

1133
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:15,995
It's called Ca' Pasquale.

1134
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:17,170
-It's there.
-True...

1135
01:21:17,371 --> 01:21:19,464
then, go to the left...

1136
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:21,641
Yes, it's a shortcut
we always use.

1137
01:21:21,842 --> 01:21:22,900
By avoiding Orione,

1138
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:24,372
we'll get to Santo Ambrogio.

1139
01:21:24,578 --> 01:21:25,875
Thanks, lieutenant.

1140
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:28,174
-Are you from the South?
-I'm from Naples.

1141
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:29,712
Good luck, lieutenant!

1142
01:21:30,818 --> 01:21:32,046
Give me the reins! 
I'll take the horse now.

1143
01:21:32,253 --> 01:21:33,379
Yes sir

1144
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:31,377
I've got to get to the other side of the mountain.
I need to pass!

1145
01:22:32,246 --> 01:22:34,771
I have a permission.

1146
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:36,775
Here it is!

1147
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:38,740
Alarm!

1148
01:24:10,277 --> 01:24:12,507
I received a letter from Franz.

1149
01:24:13,013 --> 01:24:15,811
He was discharged
and now he is in Verona.

1150
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,609
But he asked me to stay home.

1151
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:20,786
He was afraid...

1152
01:24:20,988 --> 01:24:23,218
I could get hurt in the trip

1153
01:24:24,224 --> 01:24:26,818
The battle has begun in every front...

1154
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:29,526
and the news that arrived...

1155
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:32,855
confirmed that the Italians were winning.

1156
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:43,365
Shut up. Here comes Luca!

1157
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:46,038
Let's see what's new!

1158
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:08,558
They are running away!

1159
01:25:09,436 --> 01:25:12,030
-Viva Italia!
-Viva Italia!

1160
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:15,175
Good morning,  Countess.

1161
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:16,933
Is it true that Austrians are leaving Verona?

1162
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:18,236
Yes, Countess

1163
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:20,504
it seems that our soldiers
are winning every front...

1164
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,147
and that Austrians are going to Trento.

1165
01:25:22,349 --> 01:25:24,317
That's why they are leaving Verona.

1166
01:25:24,518 --> 01:25:25,507
And it's also true...

1167
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:27,710
that Austrians are leaving forever.

1168
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:30,014
Viva Italia!

1169
01:25:30,224 --> 01:25:31,748
Aren't we going to fight?

1170
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:34,189
It's the time to act in our own interest.

1171
01:25:34,394 --> 01:25:35,725
And the Marquis de Ussoni?

1172
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:39,490
Nobody knows about him. 
There are no news.

1173
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:44,631
No, we can't act.

1174
01:25:45,706 --> 01:25:47,298
We must wait the orders.

1175
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:48,839
But, Countess...

1176
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:50,407
we can't wait any longer...

1177
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:52,306
even though we don't know a thing...

1178
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:54,947
our troops must act and occupie the zones.

1179
01:25:55,149 --> 01:25:56,946
There's no time to waste!

1180
01:25:57,417 --> 01:25:59,248
We won't be a part of this.

1181
01:26:00,687 --> 01:26:02,712
Garibaldi will come here!

1182
01:26:02,923 --> 01:26:05,892
Countess, Garibaldi!
Can you imagine?

1183
01:26:28,515 --> 01:26:30,107
What's the matter? What are you doing here?

1184
01:26:32,753 --> 01:26:34,118
What's the matter?

1185
01:26:34,321 --> 01:26:35,515
Where are you going?

1186
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:37,388
We have orders to retreat.

1187
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:19,550
Sargeant! Do we still
have amunitions?

1188
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,707
-Who are you? Are you hurt?
-It doesn't matter

1189
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:42,881
Everybody is leaving, Lieutenant!

1190
01:28:45,352 --> 01:28:46,319
And we?

1191
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,751
-It's true.
-It's a retreat.

1192
01:28:51,391 --> 01:28:54,827
Lieutenant! There's an order to retreat!

1193
01:28:55,529 --> 01:28:58,123
-Let's go! All of us!
-It's OK, Lieutenant!

1194
01:29:07,374 --> 01:29:08,841
I decided to go...

1195
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:10,168
before sunrise.

1196
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:12,038
Before Aldano...

1197
01:29:12,245 --> 01:29:14,008
was occuppied by the patriots.

1198
01:29:14,514 --> 01:29:16,948
And before the Italian troops 
get to Verona.

1199
01:29:18,352 --> 01:29:21,116
I knew I was leaving my house forever...

1200
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:22,720
my country...

1201
01:29:22,923 --> 01:29:26,017
However I dind't feel nostalgia
or remorsements

1202
01:29:39,973 --> 01:29:42,498
The walls of the carriage were burning...

1203
01:29:42,776 --> 01:29:44,403
and I felt suffocated...

1204
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:46,408
with that heavy atmosphere.

1205
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:50,450
I have the letter that Franz sent me...

1206
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:55,110
I read it over and over, even though
I already memorized it

1207
01:29:56,623 --> 01:29:58,022
"Beloved Livia ...

1208
01:29:59,025 --> 01:30:00,549
you saved my life.

1209
01:30:01,928 --> 01:30:04,453
So far, the money has been usefuls,
at least...

1210
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:07,299
to satisfy the greed of doctors.

1211
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:10,763
I am stuck in Verona.

1212
01:30:12,172 --> 01:30:14,572
I have a beautiful room 
in front of the Adige river...

1213
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:17,168
  149 Santo Stefano street.

1214
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:19,809
I wish you were here with me...

1215
01:30:20,113 --> 01:30:22,946
day and night

1216
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,913
But, don't come now.

1217
01:30:25,118 --> 01:30:28,815
Don't move. The trip
is too dangerous.

1218
01:30:30,357 --> 01:30:31,847
Love me forever...

1219
01:30:32,526 --> 01:30:34,255
as I love you".

1220
01:32:42,255 --> 01:32:43,449
Do you have a permission...

1221
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:45,625
to enter Verona 
at these hours?

1222
01:32:45,825 --> 01:32:46,985
No, but...

1223
01:32:47,193 --> 01:32:48,387
I am Countess Serpieri.

1224
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:50,426
My husband is an Austrian officer.

1225
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:52,461
I came to see some relatives.

1226
01:32:53,767 --> 01:32:54,791
That's fine! You may pass, Countess

1227
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:56,935
But I must warn you, tonight
the streets of Verona...

1228
01:32:57,137 --> 01:32:59,071
are not that safe
for a Lady.

1229
01:32:59,673 --> 01:33:00,697
Thank you.

1230
01:33:00,907 --> 01:33:02,602
Hurry! 149 Santo Stefano St.

1231
01:33:02,809 --> 01:33:04,299
-Go!
-Good night, Countess.

1232
01:33:04,544 --> 01:33:05,772
Go!

1233
01:33:47,053 --> 01:33:48,145
Franz!

1234
01:33:51,558 --> 01:33:52,650
Franz!

1235
01:33:56,763 --> 01:33:58,560
What a lovely surprise!

1236
01:33:59,299 --> 01:34:01,597
-Oh, Franz!
-What?

1237
01:34:03,737 --> 01:34:04,897
I am here.

1238
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:10,904
-Something has happened?
-I am here, Franz.

1239
01:34:11,511 --> 01:34:14,036
 I sent a letter 
asking you not to come.

1240
01:34:15,849 --> 01:34:18,613
-Haven't you received?
-Yes, but I have to come.

1241
01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:20,342
I couldn't keep on living with 
this anguish

1242
01:34:20,553 --> 01:34:21,747
Anguish?

1243
01:34:22,355 --> 01:34:23,652
Why?

1244
01:34:24,124 --> 01:34:25,955
For all the things that could
happen to you.

1245
01:34:26,626 --> 01:34:28,287
You knew I was on a safe place.

1246
01:34:28,828 --> 01:34:30,489
And you knew how:

1247
01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:33,497
with your money.

1248
01:34:35,068 --> 01:34:37,434
You knew I bought my impunity...

1249
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:39,270
my tranquility...

1250
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:40,699
and welfare...

1251
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:43,109
peace, pleasures...

1252
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:46,344
Franz, I wanted to be sure...

1253
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:52,007
See it with my own eyes.

1254
01:34:54,754 --> 01:34:56,517
Well, you've seen it!

1255
01:34:57,691 --> 01:34:59,158
You shouldn't have came here.

1256
01:35:01,094 --> 01:35:03,324
It was a mistake, Livia, 
you will regret it

1257
01:35:06,332 --> 01:35:07,424
Look!

1258
01:35:07,634 --> 01:35:09,499
I am not an officer...

1259
01:35:10,036 --> 01:35:11,867
Not even an officer.

1260
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,502
I am a drunk deserter...

1261
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,048
disgusting and stinking...

1262
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,784
a coward and full of vices.

1263
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,588
But now I am here, Franz.

1264
01:35:34,594 --> 01:35:36,459
I'll stay with you forever.

1265
01:35:37,997 --> 01:35:39,794
I left everything for you!

1266
01:35:43,002 --> 01:35:45,027
Hold me, Franz!

1267
01:35:51,444 --> 01:35:54,470
I haven't washed or shaved myself
in days

1268
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:00,742
I don't want you near me,
not even a graze.

1269
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:06,225
You'd get dirty!

1270
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:12,655
Franz!

1271
01:36:14,868 --> 01:36:16,199
Franz!

1272
01:36:16,469 --> 01:36:18,164
Oh! Franz!

1273
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:26,438
-You are not alone?
-It's not important

1274
01:36:28,047 --> 01:36:29,776
She comes every night,
a couple of hours...

1275
01:36:29,983 --> 01:36:31,507
to accompany me.

1276
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:36,821
Do you want to meet her?

1277
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:40,020
Come on, no compliments!

1278
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:42,085
After all...

1279
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:44,057
she belongs to you...

1280
01:36:44,931 --> 01:36:47,195
I pay her with your money.

1281
01:37:00,213 --> 01:37:01,271
Clara!

1282
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:02,839
Clara, come!

1283
01:37:04,617 --> 01:37:07,245
I want to introduce you
to a great lady

1284
01:37:10,423 --> 01:37:14,291
Countess Livia Serpieri.

1285
01:37:16,262 --> 01:37:18,355
She made a long trip

1286
01:37:18,631 --> 01:37:21,361
As you see, she is tired

1287
01:37:23,436 --> 01:37:26,496
She saw soldiers coming from battle...

1288
01:37:29,642 --> 01:37:31,872
Men who didn't have the fortune...

1289
01:37:32,412 --> 01:37:34,380
I had:

1290
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,049
a rich protector

1291
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:51,297
Clara...

1292
01:37:52,098 --> 01:37:53,861
give her something to drink.

1293
01:38:13,786 --> 01:38:15,344
But wash it before...

1294
01:38:16,055 --> 01:38:17,488
stupid!

1295
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:20,255
It's for a lady!

1296
01:38:21,494 --> 01:38:24,122
A lady doesn't drink 
in a dirty goblet.

1297
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:25,524
Don't you know that?

1298
01:38:34,407 --> 01:38:37,035
We must treat our guests kindly.

1299
01:38:41,981 --> 01:38:43,471
Don't you want it?

1300
01:38:44,617 --> 01:38:45,845
Are you sick?

1301
01:38:51,157 --> 01:38:52,749
What are you waiting?
Help her, you idiot!

1302
01:38:53,826 --> 01:38:56,294
Take her veil! 
the hat, the gloves

1303
01:38:56,863 --> 01:38:58,490
Countess Serpieri
is a lady...

1304
01:38:58,698 --> 01:39:01,565
a  lady with class, an important lady
Can't you see it?

1305
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:10,202
-I already told you about her.
-No!

1306
01:39:11,978 --> 01:39:13,707
You don't remember.

1307
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:17,614
You never wanted to listen to me
because you thought I was lying.

1308
01:39:18,451 --> 01:39:19,679
Oh, sure!

1309
01:39:20,486 --> 01:39:21,851
You thought I was lying...

1310
01:39:22,055 --> 01:39:24,023
when I told you
a real lady...

1311
01:39:24,223 --> 01:39:25,781
such as Countess Serpieri...

1312
01:39:26,326 --> 01:39:28,055
is in love with me

1313
01:39:31,864 --> 01:39:32,956
It's true

1314
01:39:35,001 --> 01:39:36,298
She told me...

1315
01:39:36,502 --> 01:39:38,561
that if it weren't for me,
she wouldn't know love...

1316
01:39:38,771 --> 01:39:40,739
For me

1317
01:39:46,546 --> 01:39:48,810
Why are you saying all this?

1318
01:39:50,883 --> 01:39:52,316
To hurt me..

1319
01:39:52,685 --> 01:39:54,653
or to punish yourself?

1320
01:39:54,954 --> 01:39:56,979
Pardon, I can't hear you...

1321
01:39:58,324 --> 01:39:59,985
you speak so soft.

1322
01:40:02,028 --> 01:40:04,258
Did you hear, Clara?

1323
01:40:04,764 --> 01:40:07,824
No, I didn't hear anything,
And I don't want to hear.

1324
01:40:09,535 --> 01:40:11,594
-I'm leaving.
-You are crazy!

1325
01:40:12,972 --> 01:40:14,337
Livia...

1326
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:17,874
you can't allow her to leave 
at these hours.

1327
01:40:20,847 --> 01:40:23,680
Ask her to sit with us
in the table.

1328
01:40:27,587 --> 01:40:29,145
Tell her!

1329
01:40:35,361 --> 01:40:37,488
Please, stay.

1330
01:40:51,611 --> 01:40:54,409
Don't listen to him. He's drunk.

1331
01:41:25,344 --> 01:41:27,710
Can you tell me who 
do you think you are?

1332
01:41:29,649 --> 01:41:32,243
Are you that good...

1333
01:41:32,452 --> 01:41:34,818
that can't sit on a table with a whore?

1334
01:41:39,092 --> 01:41:41,253
What's the difference between you?

1335
01:41:44,964 --> 01:41:46,329
I'll tell you:.

1336
01:41:47,834 --> 01:41:49,324
She is young

1337
01:41:49,569 --> 01:41:51,196
and beautiful

1338
01:41:51,404 --> 01:41:53,304
And men pay to be with her

1339
01:41:55,374 --> 01:41:56,932
On the other hand, you...

1340
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,843
Why do you look at me like that?

1341
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,912
I don't like that look!
Are you listening?

1342
01:42:12,658 --> 01:42:14,683
Do you think I'm crazy?

1343
01:42:15,561 --> 01:42:17,392
No, I'm not crazy!

1344
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:20,096
I've never been this wise!

1345
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:27,268
Listen and try to understand.

1346
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:29,634
Try to see me as I am in reality..

1347
01:42:29,842 --> 01:42:32,003
not in the way you imagined.

1348
01:42:33,513 --> 01:42:36,641
This idea you made of me 
is pure fantasy

1349
01:42:36,883 --> 01:42:38,475
You created it...

1350
01:42:38,684 --> 01:42:41,175
It has nothing to do with how I really am.

1351
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:43,188
Who am I?

1352
01:42:43,923 --> 01:42:45,083
How do I live?

1353
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:46,856
By wich means?

1354
01:42:47,059 --> 01:42:49,084
With the money I get in two ways:

1355
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:51,826
the money women give me

1356
01:42:52,431 --> 01:42:54,922
and the money I get playing 
and cheating.

1357
01:42:56,135 --> 01:42:58,365
I am a proffesional
in both fields!

1358
01:42:59,372 --> 01:43:01,033
These are my skills

1359
01:43:04,877 --> 01:43:07,004
And there's one more:

1360
01:43:08,548 --> 01:43:11,108
I am a deserter
because I am a coward...

1361
01:43:13,186 --> 01:43:16,485
and I don't care anymore.

1362
01:43:20,426 --> 01:43:22,724
I don't care if
my countrymen

1363
01:43:22,929 --> 01:43:24,920
won a battle today

1364
01:43:25,131 --> 01:43:26,462
in a place named Custoza?

1365
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:28,697
I know they are going to loose the war

1366
01:43:28,901 --> 01:43:30,391
And not only that

1367
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:32,735
Austria, in a few years

1368
01:43:33,239 --> 01:43:34,763
will be finished

1369
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:38,839
A whole world will disappear

1370
01:43:39,712 --> 01:43:43,170
The world we both belong to

1371
01:43:45,718 --> 01:43:47,845
The new world,
the one your cousin talks about.

1372
01:43:48,054 --> 01:43:49,919
It's not interesting to me

1373
01:43:50,756 --> 01:43:53,384
It's better not to meddle in to it

1374
01:43:54,894 --> 01:43:57,260
and search pleasure
whenever is possible

1375
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:01,124
Besides, you thinh the same way

1376
01:44:02,101 --> 01:44:06,333
If not, Countess, you wouldn't give me money
to pay an hour of love

1377
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:13,708
-No! No!
-Stop it!

1378
01:44:14,513 --> 01:44:17,004
It's too late! It's over!

1379
01:44:17,216 --> 01:44:19,377
I am not your romantic heroe.

1380
01:44:22,488 --> 01:44:24,319
I don't love you anymore, Livia.

1381
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:27,222
I needed money and you gave it to me

1382
01:44:33,065 --> 01:44:36,057
Ah, I forgot
I am also an informer

1383
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:38,829
It was me who denounced your cousin.

1384
01:44:39,272 --> 01:44:41,934
Of course, you knew it,
but prefer to ignore it...

1385
01:44:42,141 --> 01:44:44,507
to save our love story

1386
01:44:47,146 --> 01:44:50,673
No! No!

1387
01:44:58,891 --> 01:45:01,519
Go! Go away, Lady!

1388
01:45:02,361 --> 01:45:04,591
Go! Go, whore!

1389
01:45:05,898 --> 01:45:11,234
Go! Fast!
Don't stop!

1390
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:10,184
I come to fulfill my duty...

1391
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:12,821
as a loyal subject.

1392
01:47:13,025 --> 01:47:15,323
Is the Countess an Austrian?

1393
01:47:18,664 --> 01:47:19,631
Venetian.

1394
01:47:36,749 --> 01:47:37,943
Here it is

1395
01:47:43,155 --> 01:47:46,488
I don't understand. Isn't this
a letter addressed to you?

1396
01:48:12,885 --> 01:48:14,785
Let's see. Explain yourself

1397
01:48:25,331 --> 01:48:26,696
It's a letter from

1398
01:48:28,934 --> 01:48:32,301
Franz Mahler, Third
Artillery Regiment.

1399
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:34,200
And?

1400
01:48:35,307 --> 01:48:36,774
The letter is very clear.

1401
01:48:39,178 --> 01:48:41,339
He passed as a sick person
bribing.

1402
01:48:41,614 --> 01:48:42,808
some doctors

1403
01:48:44,984 --> 01:48:47,179
He is a deserter

1404
01:48:47,386 --> 01:48:50,583
Ah! I understand
The Lieutenant was your lover...

1405
01:48:50,789 --> 01:48:53,417
and you want a revenge
by getting him executed

1406
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:57,825
Think it over, Countess
accussing somebody is an infamy..

1407
01:48:58,063 --> 01:49:00,190
and what you're doing is murder

1408
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:19,849
General...

1409
01:49:20,152 --> 01:49:21,551
fulfill your duty!
