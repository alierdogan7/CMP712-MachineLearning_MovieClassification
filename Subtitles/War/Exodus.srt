00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,199
[Guide]
THE ISLAND OF CYPRUS, MADAM.

2
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,702
WORLD FAMOUS FOR BEAUTY
AND LONG, TRAGIC HISTORY.

3
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,704
BEEN CONQUERED MANY TIMES.

4
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:39,709
CONQUERED BY
PHOENICIANS, ASSYRIANS,
PERSIANS, MACEDONIANS.

5
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,215
ALSO CONQUERED
BY GREEKS, ROMANS,
BYZANTINES, TURKS.

6
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:49,719
PURCHASED FROM TURKEY
BY YOUR ESTEEMED SELF,
THE BRITISH EMPIRE.

7
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,222
ALL CYPRUS MOST
FOND OF THE BRITISH.

8
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,226
I'M AN AMERICAN.

9
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:59,729
FOND OF AMERICANS
ALSO. WE CYPRIOTS
ARE FOND OF EVERYBODY.

10
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,232
SHALL WE GO
THROUGH THE
CASTLE NOW?

11
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,734
NO, I'VE CHANGED
MY MIND.

12
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,238
THEN MAYBE THE TOWER
OF OTHELLO AT THE
HARBOR OF FAMAGUSTA.

13
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:09,239
IT'S INCLUDED
IN THE TOUR.

14
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:10,740
ALL RIGHT.

15
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:34,764
[Baby crying]

16
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,787
[Siren wailing slowly]

17
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,815
?
WHAT'S THE MATTER HERE

18
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,819
PRISON SHIP HAS
ARRIVED FULL OF JEWS
FOR THE CAMPS, MADAM.

19
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,321
WHAT CAMPS?

20
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,323
DETENTION CAMPS OUT
AT KARAOLOS, MADAM.

21
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,325
YOU SEE, THE JEWS,
THEY CHARTER A SHIP

22
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,327
FROM EUROPE TO
GET TO PALESTINE.

23
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:40,830
THEN THE BRITISH, THEY
CATCH THE SHIP AND SEND
THE WHOLE BUNCH HERE.

24
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,332
THE ARABS DON'T WANT
THEM IN PALESTINE.

25
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:45,335
AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE
BRITISH DON'T WANT
THEM HERE, EITHER.

26
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:46,336
BUT THEY GOT THEM.

27
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:47,337
[Guard]
STOP!

28
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:54,844

29
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:57,847
[Guard]
STOP!

30
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,349
STOP!

31
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:01,351
GET HIM!

32
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,353
GET HIM!

33
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:09,359
MAYBE YOU CAN
BACK UP AND DRIVE
ME TO THIS ADDRESS.

34
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,363
HOUSE OF THE
BRITISH COMMANDER.

35
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,865
[Engine starting]

36
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,390

[Shrieks]

38
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,923
NOW, THEN.

39
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:14,924
GET HIS FEET.

40
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:15,925
RIGHT.

41
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,428
UP.

42
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,453
MRS. FREMONT?

43
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:47,957
THE GENERAL'S
EXPECTING YOU
IN THE GARDEN.

44
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,469
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. FREMONT?

45
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,472
I'M VERY GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

46
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,974
PLEASE
SIT DOWN.

47
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,477
OH, FOUND THAT HERE
IN THE GARDEN.

48
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,980
FROM THE COLOR,
I'D SAY IT BELONGS TO
THE BYZANTINE PERIOD.

49
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,484
THE BYZANTINES
OCCUPIED CYPRUS
FOR CENTURIES.

50
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,986
GIVES ONE AN
IDEA HOW TEMPORARY

51
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,489
OUR CLAIMS TO THE
WORLD'S REAL ESTATE ARE.

52
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,992
Y.
I'M ASHAMED TO SAY
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ARCHEOLOG

53
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,494
FEW PEOPLE DO.

54
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,496
DIDN'T YOU ONCE
PUBLISH SOMETHING

55
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,997
ABOUT THE ROMAN
RUINS IN CHELTENHAM?

56
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:31,000
A VERY OBSCURE
SOMETHING. HOW
DID YOU KNOW?

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,002
TOM MENTIONED IT IN
ONE OF HIS LETTERS.

58
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,004
HE WAS VERY PROUD
OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

59
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,507
AS I WAS OF HIS.

60
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:41,511
WILL YOU HAVE TEA,
OR SOMETHING LIVELIER?

61
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,513
SOMETHING
LIVELIER,
PLEASE.

62
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,516
IS THAT ICE
I SEE?

63
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,017
SURPRISED?

64
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:52,522
TOM GOT ME
INTO THE HABIT.

65
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:56,025
NOW I USE ICE IN
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING.

66
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,028
THERE WE ARE.

67
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,034
MAY WE DRINK TO TOM?

68
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,537
OF COURSE.

69
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,042
S
I'M EXTREMELY
SORRY CIRCUMSTANCE

70
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,545
COMPELLED US TO
BURY HIM IN THE FIELD.

71
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,548
EVEN SORRIER I
WAS TRANSFERRED
FROM PALESTINE

72
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,050
BEFORE I GOT THE
CHANCE TO SEE YOU.

73
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,555
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
IT TOOK ME ALMOST A
WEEK TO ARRANGE PASSAGE.

74
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,058
BUT YOUR LETTER WAS
WAITING THERE FOR ME,
AND TOM'S THINGS.

75
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,561
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HIM GO WITH US,
YOU KNOW, MRS. FREMONT.

76
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,563
IT WAS ONLY A
BORDER AFFAIR.

77
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,566
ONE OF THE JEWISH
UNDERGROUNDS HAD BLOWN UP
HALF A DOZEN BRIDGES.

78
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:40,570
R.
IT REALLY WASN'T IMPORTA
ENOUGH TO LOSE ONE'S LIFE FO

79
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,572
IS ANYTHING?

80
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,575
WELL, IN MY
OPINION, YES.

81
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:49,579
I'VE KNOWN MANY
SOLDIERS, MRS. FREMONT,
AND WAR CORRESPONDENTS

82
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,081
AND NEWS PHOTOGRAPHERS,
SUCH AS YOUR HUSBAND.

83
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,585
BUT I THINK PERHAPS
TOM WAS THE BRAVEST
MAN I'VE EVER MET.

84
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,005
WE HAVE A SAYING
IN INDIANA,

85
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,507
"THE BRAVER THE BIRD,
THE FATTER THE CAT."

86
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,509
PERHAPS.

87
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,513
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS
PHOTOGRAPH, GENERAL?

88
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,515
ST.
OF COURSE.
 IT WAS HIS LA

89
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,517
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW
TOM GOT THAT SHOT?

90
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,519
WELL, WE WERE
TOGETHER.

91
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,522
I MUST CONFESS, MY EYES
WEREN'T ON HIM AT THE MOMENT
HE SNAPPED THE SHUTTER.

92
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,525
K.
THE AIRCRAFT CAME IN L
OW. WE WERE BOTH IN THE TRUC

93
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,028
I JUMPED DOWN ON O
NE SIDE TO TAKE COVER,

94
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,530
AND TOM JUMPED DOWN
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

95
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,534
TOM COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
COVER AND PHOTOGRAPHED
THE PLANE AS HE DID.

96
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:33,039
I DARE SAY YOU'RE
RIGHT. HE HAD A STRONG
SENSE OF DUTY.

97
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,042
HE ALSO HAD A
STRONG SENSE OF DEATH.

98
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,546
I FELT I HAD TO
CONFIRM WHAT I SUSPECTED
ABOUT THE LAST PHOTOGRAPH.

99
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,548
I'M VERY GRATEFUL
TO YOU.

100
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,053
WELL, THAT'S OVER A YEAR
AGO. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN
OCCUPYING YOURSELF?

101
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,554
AFTER I LOST
THE CHILD, I WAS--

102
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,056
THE CHILD?

103
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,560
DIDN'T TOM TELL YOU WE
HAD A CHILD ON THE WAY?

104
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,063
MEN LIKE TOM ARE
OFTEN QUITE RETICENT

105
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,565
ABOUT THINGS THAT AR
E NEAREST TO THEIR HEARTS.

106
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,535
I UNDERSTAND.

107
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,038
IT WAS QUITE
LATE IN MY PREGNANCY
WHEN TOM WAS KILLED.

108
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,541
APPARENTLY THE PALESTINE
TRIP WAS TOO MUCH.

109
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,544
I LOST THE BABY IN THE
HOSPITAL AT JERUSALEM.

110
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,549
AND THEN I WENT
BACK TO MY OLD
PROFESSION OF NURSING.

111
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,551
I'VE JUST COMPLETED
MY TOUR OF DUTY

112
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,553
WITH THE U.S. PUBLIC
HEALTH SERVICE IN GREECE.

113
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,056
?
VERY GOOD. WHA
T ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE

114
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:29,562
I HAVEN'T QUITE DECIDED
YET. I MAY TRAVEL A WHILE
BEFORE I GO HOME.

115
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,564
I HAVE PASSAGE
BOOKED ON A FREIGHTER

116
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,566
THAT SAILS NEXT
WEEK TO ISTANBUL.

117
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,569
FROM THERE I--I
MAY GO TO INDIA.

118
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,071
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
SEE THE VALE OF KASHMIR.

119
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,074
IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL SPOT ON EARTH.

120
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,577
MRS. FREMONT
, MAY I INTRODUC
E MAJ. CALDWELL?

121
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,579
HOW DO YOU DO?
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. FREMONT?

122
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,580
NK.
HAVE A DRI

123
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,581
THANK YOU, SIR.
I'D LOVE ONE.

O?
WELL, HOW DID YO
UR DISEMBARKATION G

125
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,084
SMOOTHLY.

126
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,587
WE'RE REALLY UP
TO OUR NECK
IN JEWS, SIR.

127
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,590
KARAOLOS BURSTING
AT THE SEAMS
AND MORE TO COME.

128
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,093
I STILL SAY WE
SHOULD SEND THEM BACK
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

129
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,096
SIR, 2 LOADS WERE
SHIPPED OUT OF HAIFA LAST
WEEK BOUND FOR HAMBURG.

130
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,098
I DON'T SEE WHY
WE CAN'T DO
THE SAME THING.

131
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,600
I SHOULDN'T LI
KE TO HAVE A HAND

132
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,101
IN SENDING A JEW
BACK TO GERMANY.

133
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,103
SQUEEZE THEM IN AS
BEST AS YOU CAN.

134
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,106
THEY'RE SQUEEZED IN,
ALL RIGHT. SHORT OF BED
SPACE, SHORT OF SUPPLIES,

135
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,610
SHORT OF NURSES,
SHORT OF TEMPER,
SHORT OF EVERYTHING.

136
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,612
MRS. FREMONT'S
A NURSE.

137
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,615
?
WHY DON'T YOU LEND
A HAND AT KARAOLOS

138
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,118
NO, GENERAL. I'M
AFRAID I COULDN'T.

139
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,622
I'VE REALLY BEEN
QUITE TIRED LATELY.

140
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,624
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

141
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,125
ABOUT THE JEWS?

142
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,627
I FEEL STRANGE
AMONG THEM.

143
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,128
IN WHAT WAY?

144
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,632
NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT, I
CAN'T THINK.

145
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,134
IT'S JUST A
FEELING I GET.

146
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,136
K?
WILL YOU H
AVE ANOTHER DRIN

147
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,638
OH, THANK YOU, NO. I
REALLY MUST LEAVE.

148
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,141
I'M TOURING THE ISLAND
AND MY GUIDE IS
VERY FIRM WITH ME.

149
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,643
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

150
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,144
THANK YOU FOR THE
DRINK AND THE TALK.

151
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,647
DRIVE BY
KARAOLOS ON

152
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,649
AND RING ME IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO

153
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,150
TO MAKE YOUR STAY ON
CYPRUS MORE COMFORTABLE.

154
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,652
I WILL.

155
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,654

[Cars honking]

158
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,617
YES, I'M VERY FOND
OF THE OLD MAN.
ONE OF THE BEST.

159
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,619
MAKES IT ALL THE MORE
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN HIS...

160
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,621
WELL, YOU MIGHT CALL
IT HIS LITTLE QUIRK.

161
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,122
QUIRK?

162
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:24,126
YES, ABOUT THE JEWS.
OH, YOU CAUGHT IT ALL
RIGHT. I WAS WATCHING.

163
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:27,129
EN.
ALMOST MAKES ONE
BELIEVE THE STORY ONE
HEARS EVERY NOW AND TH

164
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,631
PROBABLY NONSENSE,
OF COURSE,
BUT STILL...

165
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:30,132
WHAT STORY?

166
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,135

00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,164
THE UNITED NATIONS
WILL VOTE ON THE
PALESTINE ISSUE

335
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,666
BEFORE THE END OF
THIS PRESENT SESSION.

336
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,669
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN
WE HAVE TO SHOW THE WORLD

337
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,671
THAT THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS
JEWS IN EUROPE

338
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,174
ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT
ANY SOLUTION THAT BARS
THEM FROM PALESTINE.

339
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,176
LE
A MASS ESCAPE OF
THE VERY SAME PEOP

340
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,679
WHO ARRIVED YESTERDA
Y ON THE STAR OF DAVID

341
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,681
.
IS WORTH MORE THAN
A MILLION SPEECHES

342
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,684
BUT THIS ISN'T THE
RED SEA, ARI. IT'S
THE MEDITERRANEAN.

343
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,187
RIGHT. SMITE THESE
WATERS AS YOU WILL,
THEY DO NOT PART.

344
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,690
THAT'S WHY YOU WIL
L HAVE TO GET US A
SHIP MR. MANDRIA.

345
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,692
TER
I WANT A LEGITIMATE FREIGH

346
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,695
WITH LEGAL REGISTRY AND
REAL CARGO THAT WE CAN UNLOAD
RIGHT HERE IN CYPRUS.

347
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,697
A SHIP FOR 6...

348
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,702
THAT'S A
WONDERFUL IDEA.

349
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,205
BRILLIANT.

350
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,209
BUT THE EXPENSE WILL
BE BRILLIANT ALSO.

351
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,711
T.
NOT TOO BRILLIAN

352
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,713
S,
YOU KNOW, OUR TREASU
RY IS BASED ON DONATION

353
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,715

AND RIGHT NOW
WE'RE RATHER L

354
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,719

WELL, CAN YO
U DELIVER OR NOT

355
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,221
I'LL DO MY BEST.

356
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:48,226
WE CYPRIOTS ARE WITH YOU.
FOR THE JEWS, MANDRIA
WILL DO EVERYTHING.

357
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,730
THE JEWS HAVE PAID YOU
WELL FOR YOUR EFFORTS,
MR. MANDRIA.

358
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,732
ARI, YOU'VE GOT
TO UNDERSTAND--

359
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,734
NO, REUBEN.
I SAY IT.

360
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,740
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
I, PLATO MANDRIA, WOULD
DO THIS FOR MONEY?

361
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,244
DO YOU THINK I'D
RISK 10 YEARS IN
PRISON FOR MONEY?

362
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:11,249
I TELL YOU, IT HAS COST ME
OVER 5,000 POUNDS SINCE
I WORK WITH THE HAGANAH.

363
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,251
YOU OWE HI
M AN APOLOGY, ARI.

364
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,256
I DO APOLOGIZE
, MR. MANDRIA. I
T WAS A STUPID REMARK.

365
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,758
[Mandria]
NOT NECESSARY.

366
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,760
IF I APOLOGIZE EACH
TIME I GET STUPID,

367
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,763
I'D SPEND A
LIFETIME ON MY KNEES.

368
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,765
ALSO, WE'LL NEED
14 LORRIES.

369
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,266
14, HE SAYS.
WHY NOT 1,400?

370
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,769
[David
] ARI, THE BRITISH H
AVE REQUISITIONED EVERY CAR,

371
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,771
.
TRUCK AND LORR
Y ON THIS ISLAND

372
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,773
E.
HAGANAH MA
KES MISTAKES, JU
ST LIKE ANYBODY ELS

373
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:35,774
AND THIS I
S ONE OF THEM.

374
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,276
DAVID, I WANT TO
HEAR EVERY OBJECTION,

375
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,779
EVERY CRITICISM,
EVERY SUGGESTION,
BUT ONLY ONCE.

376
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,782
NOW PROJECT OF THE BOAT
IS UNDER WAY, RIGHT?

377
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,283
ALMOST ACCOMPLISHED.

378
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,786
I WILL SEND A TELEGRAM
TO A SHIPBROKER FRIEND
OF MINE IN ATHENS.

379
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,287
DON'T THE BRITISH
MONITOR TELEGRAMS?

380
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,789
NATURALLY.

381
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,791
BUT SOME OF THE
MONITORS ARE CYPRIOTS.

382
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,794
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THE BRITONS IN BRITAIN,
THE JEWS IN PALESTINE

383
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,798
AND THE CYPRIOTS IN
CYPRUS. NOT, MIND YOU,
THAT I'M ANTI-BRITISH.

384
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,801
IF I MUST HAVE
A MASTER, THE BRITISH
ARE FAR THE BEST.

385
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,304
BUT THE PROBLEM,
MY DEAR FRIEND, IS, WHY
HAVE A MASTER AT ALL?

386
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,313
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
HURT HIM, ARI.
HE'S A REAL FRIEND.

387
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,817
MAYBE, BUT DON'T LET
THE MANDRIAS FOOL YOU.

388
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,319
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
THEY WORK FOR US AND
SAY HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS

389
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,822
THAT 6 MILLION JEWS
WENT INTO THE OVEN.

390
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:26,324
BUT WHEN THE SHOWDOWN COMES,
WE ALWAYS STAND ALONE.

391
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,326
S.
MANDRIA WILL SELL US
OUT LIKE ALL THE OTHER

392
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,830
WE HAVE NO FRIENDS,
EXCEPT OURSELVES.
REMEMBER THAT.

393
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,833
YOU'RE WRONG, AR
I, BUT YOU'LL HAVE 
TO LEARN THAT FOR YOURSELF.

394
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,335
?
NOW TELL ME,
HOW IS JORDANA

395
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,338
I THINK SHE'S
IN LOVE.

396
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,841
YOU MEAN TO SAY,
YOU'VE HAD THIS LETTER
SINCE LAST NIGHT--

397
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,342
I JUST FORGOT
ABOUT IT.

398
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,845
BECAUSE HE'S IN LOVE
WITH JORDANA, HE
THINKS EVERYONE ELSE IS.

399
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,346
HE'S RIGHT.

400
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,350
SHE MENTION ME
IN THERE?

401
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,352
??[Piano playing]

402
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,354
[Guests chattering]

403
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,356
THANK YOU.

404
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,363
NO, THANK YOU.
NONE FOR ME.

405
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,866
HOW DID YOU KNOW I
POSTPONED MY DEPARTURE?

406
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,370
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
HAS A GREAT TALENT FOR
SPYING ON THE INNOCENT.

407
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,373
IT'LL INTEREST THE
M TO LEARN THAT I HAVE
A PLOT UNDER WAY.

408
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,875
GOOD. CAN YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

409
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,877
MM-HMM.

410
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,379
Y.
THERE'S A CHILD AT T
HE CAMP I'D LIKE TO T
AKE OUTSIDE FOR A HOLIDA

411
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,382
.
JUST FOR LUNCHEON,
AND PERHAPS TO BUY
HER SOME CLOTHES

412
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,886
THEN I TAKE IT
SOME OF THE STRANGENESS
HAS WORN OFF?

413
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,889
I KNOW IT WAS
FOOLISH TO SAY THAT.

414
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,392
.
BUT I CAN'T HELP
IT. I--I DO FEEL
STRANGE AMONG THEM

415
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,897
.
EXCEPT FOR THIS GIRL
. SOMEHOW SHE'S--SHE'S
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

416
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,900
S.
HER POINT OF VIE
W, THE WAY SHE WORK

417
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,903
SHE ACTS, AND FEELS AND
SPEAKS ALMOST EXACTLY
LIKE AN AMERICAN.

418
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,405
I CAN THINK OF
NO HIGHER PRAISE.

419
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,909
IT.
YOU'RE LAUGHING AT
ME, AND I DESERVE

420
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:54,412
NO, NO, I'M NOT LAUGHING.
I'M SIMPLY GLAD IT WORKED.

421
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,413
D?
WHAT WORKE

422
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,414
I WANTED YOU TO
GET INTERESTED

423
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,418
IN SOMETHING
BESIDE YOUR OWN
TROUBLES, AND YOU DID.

424
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,421
IT'S INTERESTING
THAT YOU SAW IT
SO FAST.

425
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,423
T.
AND OF COURSE, YOU
WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGH

426
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,425
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU
WEREN'T OFFENDED.

427
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,427
I SHOULDN'T LIKE YOU TO
BECOME ONE OF THOSE WOMAN

428
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,930
WHO DRIFTS THROUGH
LIFE, "FAIR TO NO PURPOSE,

429
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:17,936
"ARTFUL TO NO END,
YOUNG WITHOUT LOVERS,
OLD WITHOUT A FRIEND."

430
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,938
DO YOU HAV
E A SOLUTION T
O THE PROBLEM?

431
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:24,442
AH, IF I WERE 20 YEARS
YOUNGER, I'D OFFER
MYSELF AS A SOLUTION.

432
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,946
THE VALE OF KASHMIR IS
NO GOOD UNLESS YOU
SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE.

433
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,449
PLACES DON'T MEAN ANYTHING.
ONLY PEOPLE ARE IMPORTANT.

434
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:35,954
FILL YOUR LIFE WITH PEOPLE.
LET TOM RETURN TO THE
GRAVE WHERE HE BELONGS.

INSTEAD OF MY OWN.

ISN'T SHE
A BEAUTY?

451
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,014
YOU MUST HAVE
TOWED IT ACROSS.

452
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,017
ALL RIGHT, SHE'S NO
BEAUTY, BUT HER HEART
IS SOLID OAK. YOU'LL SEE.

THAN ANY OTHER CAPTAIN

THIS IS MR. MANDRIA,
WHO ARRANGED
FOR THIS TUB.

457
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,528
NOT A BAD
SHIP, HUH?

458
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,030
NOT A GOOD ONE,
MR. MANDRIA.

459
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,033
FOR THE MONEY WE PAY,
EVERY SHIP CANNOT
BE THE QUEEN MARY.

460
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,035
CAN THIS ABORTION
MAKE IT TO
PALESTINE?

461
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:00,038
ON MY MOTHER'S
HONOR, SHE HAS
MADE 300 TRIPS

462
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,040
FROM CYPRUS TO
TURKEY UNDER HER
LAST OWNER ALONE.

463
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,042
THAT'S JUST
THE TROUBLE.

464
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,544
WE CAN HOLD HER
TOGETHER FOR
ONE MORE ROUND.

465
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,546
I WANT
A LOUDSPEAKER
SYSTEM ABOARD.

THERE IS NO SU
CH EQUIPMENT FOR
SALE IN CYPRUS.

468
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:18,056

STEAL IT. STOCK IT WITH
PROVISIONS FOR 5 DAYS.

00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,066
I TOLD YOU
, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

475
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,069
A--A JEEP IS OUT
OF THE QUESTION,
ABSOLUTELY.

476
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,071
WILL YOU NEED
SOMEONE TO OVERHAUL
THE ENGINE TANK?

477
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,573
NO, NO, MY GANG CAN
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

ARCHBISHOP OF CYPRUS.

483
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:53,091
STEAL IT. PAINT IT.
HIDE IT TILL
I'M READY FOR IT.

484
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:12,026
THE WATER'S WONDERFUL.
MAY I HAVE ANOTHER
SWIM BEFORE MY STEAK?

485
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:15,029

YES.

SHE IS NICE.

492
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,546
WOULD IT BE TO
O DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE

493
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:33,548
FOR ME TO TAKE
HER BACK T
O AMERICA WITH ME?

494
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:36,551
NOT FROM OUR END.
WE'D BE GLAD TO
LET THEM ALL GO.

495
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:39,053
SO LONG AS THEY DON'T
END UP IN PALESTINE.

496
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,055
LET ME KNOW WHEN
YOU'VE DECIDED.

497
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:43,558
I'LL GET MAJ. CALDWELL
TO ARRANGE IT FOR YOU.

498
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:44,559
THANK YOU.

499
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:48,563
KAREN.

500
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,566
[Karen]
COMING.

501
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:06,080
KAREN, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO AMERICA?

502
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,584
.
OF COURSE. EVERYBODY
LIKES TO GO TO AMERICA

503
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:12,086
THEN YOU WILL GO.

504
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:15,590
I'LL CANCEL THE REST
OF MY TRIP, AND I'LL
TAKE YOU WITH ME.

505
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,091
AND YOU CAN GO
TO SCHOOL THERE,

506
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:18,593
AND LATER ON TO
THE UNIVERSITY.

507
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,595
AND IF YOU LIKE
IT, AND WANT TO,

508
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:22,597
YOU CAN BECOME AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN.

509
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:25,099
Y?
YOU MEAN,
GO RIGHT AWA

510
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,602
PERHAPS. IN THE
NEXT WEEK OR 2.

511
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:30,104
MEANWHILE, I MAY BE ABLE
TO GET YOU OUT OF CAMP.

512
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:32,607
I'LL SPEAK TO THE
GENERAL TONIGHT.

513
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:36,110
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, KAREN?

514
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,111
NOTHING.

515
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:40,114
YOU DO WANT TO
GO, DON'T YOU?

516
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:42,617
..
YES, BUT I MEAN.

517
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,620
E.
I MUST THINK
ABOUT IT A LITTL

518
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,622
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

519
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,123
.
I DON'T KNOW

520
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,627
.
BUT IT'S SO
IMPORTANT, AND I
NEED A LITTLE TIME

521
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,129
.
YOU KNOW, TO THINK

522
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,133
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU WISH.

523
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:02,637
KITTY?

524
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,138
YES?

525
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:07,141
.
DON'T BE MAD AT ME

526
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:09,644
OF COURSE NOT.

527
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:14,649
IT'S GETTING LATE.
YOU BETTER FINISH
YOUR STEAK.

528
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:27,662
FINE THING, WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO FOR KAREN,
MRS. FREMONT.

529
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:28,663
SHE TOLD YOU?

530
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,164
MM-HMM.

531
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:32,166
SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT HER FATHER.

532
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:36,170
VE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
HER FATHER WAS ALI

533
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,174
WHEN KAREN WAS 6,
HE SMUGGLED HER OUT
OF GERMANY TO DENMARK.

534
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:43,678
AFTER THE WAR,
SHE WENT BACK TO
FIND HER PARENTS.

535
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,681
THE JEWISH AGENCY HAD
RECORDS OF THE DEAD.

536
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,683
SHE FOUND HER MOTHER'S
NAME ON THE DACHAU LIST,

537
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,185
TOGETHER WITH HER
2 YOUNGER BROTHERS.

538
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:53,187
ABOUT THE FATHER
THERE WAS NOTHING,

539
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:55,189
SO NATURALLY SHE HOPES
HE IS STILL ALIVE.

540
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:59,193
MAYBE IN PALESTINE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE IS SUCH A POSSIBILITY.

541
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,195
HE WAS A VERY
IMPORTANT SCIENTIST

542
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:03,197
AND THE NAZIS COULD
HAVE SPARED HIS LIFE

543
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:06,701
IN ORDER TO USE HIS BRAIN.
BUT, OF COURSE, WHO KNOWS?

544
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,706
.
IT'S CURIOUS THA
T SHE DIDN'T MENTION
HER FATHER TO ME

545
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:14,208
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING ABOUT
THESE CHILDREN.

546
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:18,212
THEIR PAST IS SCARRED.
THEY'RE ASHAMED OF IT.

547
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,214
TO HAVE A PARENT WHO
HAS BEEN PERSECUTED,

548
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:22,717
OR KILLED IN A
CONCENTRATION CAMP

549
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:26,721
IS A REPROACH TO THEM.
THEY FEEL GUILTY
FOR HAVING SURVIVED,

550
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:30,725
SO THEY PRETEND THE BAD
THINGS NEVER HAPPENED.

551
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:34,729
TO TAKE SUCH A CHILD IS
A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY...

552
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,230
...EVEN A SACRIFICE.

553
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,232
WELL, IT'S NO SACRIFICE.

554
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:42,236
I'M ALONE. THE INSURANCE
I GOT AFTER THE DEATH OF M
Y HUSBAND IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

555
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,739
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN A
FINANCIAL SACRIFICE,

556
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,741
ALTHOUGH IT'S
ALWAYS A GOOD THING
TO HAVE MONEY.

557
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:51,746
NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS,
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE A
SACRIFICE OF YOURSELF.

558
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:54,248
THESE CHILDREN WHO
HAVE LOST EVERYTHING

559
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,251
SPEND THEIR LIVES
SEARCHING FOR A NEW PARENT.

560
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:59,253
THEIR NEED REACHES
OUT TO YOUR HEART

561
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:01,756
AS NATURALLY AS A
FLOWER TURNS TO THE SUN.

562
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,257
AND THEY TRAP YOU.

563
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:05,760
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN
SO LONG WITHOUT LOVE,

564
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,262
THEY--THEY DEMAND ALL
THE LOVE YOU HAVE.

565
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:11,766
KAREN WILL DRAIN
YOU OF LOVE.
SHE'LL EXHAUST YOU.

566
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,770
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED.

567
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:24,779
I'D LIKE TO GO
WITH YOU, KITTY.

568
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,781
IF YOU STILL
WANT ME.

569
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,320

00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:44,598
I'D BETTER LOOK
INTO THIS MYSELF.
EXCUSE ME, MRS. FREMONT.

658
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:50,604
STAY HERE.

659
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,531
SERGEANT, CLEAR
THE WAY FOR MY CAR.

660
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,032
IR.
YES, S

661
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,540
I'M AFRAID THIS IS
MOST UNUSUAL, SIR.

662
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,042
WE'VE HAD NO WARNING.
I--I'LL HAVE TO CHECK
WITH HEADQUARTERS.

663
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,544
E.
THESE ORDERS SEEM
PERFECTLY CLEAR TO M

664
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,047
SIGNED BY THE COLONIAL
OFFICE AND COUNTERSIGNED
BY GEN. SUTHERLAND.

665
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,049
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS? THE WHOLE
AREA'S TIED UP.

666
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,551
WHO'S IN CHARGE?
O'HARA, SIR.

667
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,553
PERMIT ME, SIR. BOWEN,
23RD GT COMPANY.

668
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,555
SPECIAL DETAIL,
ORDERS OF
GEN. SUTHERLAND.

669
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,557
HERE ARE
THE PAPERS,
SIR.

670
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,059
HMM.

671
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,061
BE
WELL, BOWEN, I S
EE YOU'RE GOING TO

672
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,063
GETTING RID
OF SOME JE
WS FOR US, EH?

673
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,065
YES, SIR.
SHIPPING THEM
BACK TO HAMBURG.

674
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,567
IN MY OPINION,
THAT'S WHERE
THEY BELONG.

675
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,069
T.
IT'S A GERMAN
MATTER. LET THE
GERMANS HANDLE I

676
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,572
T.
APPARENTLY, THE
GENERAL'S HAD 
2ND THOUGHTS ABOUT I

677
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,574
WHY DO YOU QUESTION
THESE ORDERS,
O'HARA?

678
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,577
I DIDN'T QUESTION.
I--I JUST WANTED TO
CHECK WITH HEADQUARTERS.

679
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,580
COUNTERSIGNING ORDERS IS
NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF JUNIOR OFFICERS, SIR.

680
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,082
ITY
THE ACCEPTANCE
OF RESPONSIBIL

681
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,085
.
IS WHAT MAKE
S SENIOR OFFICER
S OUT OF JUNIORS

682
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,090
LET THEM THROUGH.
YES, SIR.

683
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,092
SHOULD HAVE STARTED
THIS POLICY 2 YEARS AGO.

684
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,095
OH, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE JEWS ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER.

685
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:06,597
BUT THEY ARE
TROUBLEMAKERS.

686
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,599
SIR, NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT, SIR.

687
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,601
YOU GET 2 OF THEM
TOGETHER, YOU'VE GOT A
DEBATE ON YOUR HANDS,

688
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,102
.
3, YOU'RE PUTTIN
G OUT A REVOLUTION

689
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,605
YES. AND HALF OF THEM
ARE COMMUNISTS ANYWAY.

690
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,608
.
YES, AND THE OTHER
HALF PAWNBROKERS

691
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,111
THEY LOOK FUNNY,
TOO. I CAN SPOT
ONE A MILE AWAY.

692
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,113
[Trucks passing loudly]

693
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,116
.
WOULD YOU MIND
LOOKING INTO MY EYE, SIR
? IT FEELS LIKE A CINDER

694
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,618
MMM, CERTAINLY.

695
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,124
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
THEM TRY TO HIDE
UNDER GENTILE NAMES.

696
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,629
BUT ONE LOOK AT
THAT FACE, AND
YOU JUST KNOW.

697
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,131
WITH A LITTLE EXPERIENCE,
YOU CAN EVEN
SMELL THEM OUT.

698
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,133
I'M SORRY, BOWEN, I
CAN'T FIND A THING.

699
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,135
MUST'VE BEEN M
Y IMAGINATION. THANKS.
HMM.

700
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,647
MAJ. CALDWELL, A-ARE
THEY TAKING EVERYBODY

701
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,649
WHO WAS ON THE
STAR OF DAVID?

00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,151
YES, MA'AM, WE ARE.

703
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,153
KAREN... THEN
KAREN'S ON ONE OF
THOSE TRUCKS.

704
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,655
KAREN?

705
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,657
KAREN HANSEN.

706
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,159
I HAVE GEN. SUTHERLAND'S
PERMISSION TO TAKE HER
TO AMERICA WITH ME.

707
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,662
WE WERE ON OUR WAY
TO KARAOLOS TO
PICK UP THE GIRL.

708
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,663
HOW OLD IS SHE?

709
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,165
14. SHE WAS
ASSIGNED TO
THE HOSPITAL.

710
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,166
OH, UH...

711
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,668
YES, IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT, UH...

712
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,670
IS THAT THE GIRL
THAT THE...

713
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,673
FORGOT HIS NAME,
THE PALESTINIAN CAMP
COMMANDER WAS TALKING ABOUT?

714
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,176
DAVID BEN AMI? YES.
HE KNEW SHE WAS
SUPPOSED GO WITH ME.

715
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,678
OH, YES, I REMEMBER
NOW. HE TOLD ME

716
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,179
THE GENERAL HAD MADE
ARRANGEMENTS FOR HER,

717
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,682
SO I LEFT HER
BEHIND, ON MY OWN
RESPONSIBILITY.

718
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,183
VERY GOOD,
BOWEN.

719
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:36,186
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

720
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:39,189
I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP,

RESPECTS TO THE GENERAL?

721

BIT OF A JEW
HIMSELF, YOU KNOW.

723
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,194
NOT REALLY?

724
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,195
HMM!

WITH HER CONSENT,
OF COURSE.

00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,749
WHO WAS IN CHARGE
OF THIS EVACUATION?

737
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,251
[Man]
CHAP NAMED BOWEN,
SIR. CAPT. BOWEN.

740
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,256
A WELL SET UP
SORT OF CHAP.

00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,264
[Sutherland]
FROM WHAT COMMAND?

744
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,266
23RD GT COMPANY, SIR.

745
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,769
IS ANYTHING IRREGULAR?

746
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,270
COULD BE.

747
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,274
WE DON'T LIST A 23RD
GT COMPANY ON CYPRUS.

748
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,776
YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT.

749
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,279
YES, I SHOULD.

750
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,281
WELL, PERHAPS
I MADE AN ERROR.

751
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,283
OH, IT'S HUMAN.

752
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:16,787
WHO ISSUED CAPT.
BOWEN'S ORDERS?

753
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,790
THEY ORIGINATED WITH BRADSHAW
OF THE COLONIAL OFFICE.

754
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,291

YOU SIGNED THEM.

WE CAN'T EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY. WITH ONE
EXCEPTION, OF COURSE.

762
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,313
YOUR SIGNATURE WAS
GENUINE, WASN'T IT?

763
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,816
SOMEONE HAD TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY, SIR.

764
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,819
AND YOU TOOK IT.
NOW YOU'VE GOT IT.

765
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,321
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE
TO DO WITH IT?

YOU MUST PROMISE ME TO
TELL THE ENTIRE STOR

820
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,990
E.
AT A PRESS CONFERE
NCE WHICH I SHALL ARRANG

821
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,991
EE?
DO YOU AGR

822
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,492
I'LL BE GLAD TO.

823
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,497
REUBEN?

824
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:51,001
SEND THIS EVERY 10 MINUTES,
AND KEEP ON SENDING IT.

825
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,003
COULD WE INTERRUPT,
PLEASE?

826
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,504
YES.

827
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,008
.
THIS IS DR. DE VRIES.
WE ELEVATED OURSELVES
INTO A MEDICAL COMMITTEE

828
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,509
GOOD.

829
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,011
IT'S OUR OPINION
THE SANITARY
ARRANGEMENTS

830
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,513
ON THIS SHIP
ARE HOPELESSLY
INADEQUATE.

831
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:07,017
UNLESS WE MAKE SOME
ADDITIONAL BATHING AND
TOILET FACILITIES,

832
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,019
WE'LL HAVE A
SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM.

833
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,021
ALL RIGHT, DOC,
WE'LL TRY TO TAKE
CARE OF IT.

834
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:15,025
THERE HE IS. THIS
IS MRS. FREMONT,
FROM GEN. SUTHERLAND.

835
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:16,526
HOW DO YOU DO?

836
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,028
HANK?
YEAH.

837
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:21,031
K?
DO WE HAVE ENOUGH
SCRAP LUMBER TO
BUILD PRIVIES ON DEC

838
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,532
I GUESS SO.

839
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,534
10-HOLERS.
KNOCK SOME SHOWERS
TOGETHER, TOO.

840
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,535
OK.

841
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,037
ANYTHING ELSE?

842
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,539
NOT FOR THE
PRESENT, THANK YOU.

843
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,041
THIS ONE TO HAIFA.

844
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,044
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

845
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,545
YES, CAPTAIN.

846
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:39,049
"YES, CAPTAIN." HIS
MAJESTY'S JEWISH BRIGADE.

847
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:43,053
NORTH AFRICA, SYRIA,
LEBANON AND PALESTINE.
THE DECORATIONS ARE REAL.

848
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,056
IS THAT WHAT SUTHERLAND
SENT YOU TO FIND OUT?

849
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:50,060
YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT THE
GIRL. SHE'S NOT AT THE
CAMP, SHE'S ON THIS SHIP.

850
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,062
AND YOU FORCED
HER TO COME ABOARD.

851
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,563
WE DON'T FORCE
ANYBODY. TEL AVIV YET?

852
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,065
NO.

853
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,066
GO ON.

854
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,068
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING.

855
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,071
I HEARD EVERY WORD YOU
SAID. I LIED TO YOU ABOUT
THE GIRL. WHAT ELSE?

856
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,073
I'M GOING TO TAKE HER
OFF THIS DEATH TRAP.

857
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,075
DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT
YOU'LL DO ON THIS SHIP.

858
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,077
YOU'LL DO EXACTLY
WHAT I TELL YOU
YOU CAN DO.

859
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,078
TEL AVIV
BEGINNING
TO SEND.

860
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,080
FINE.

861
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,582
ASSUMING WE'VE GOT THE
GIRL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE WANTS TO GET OFF?

862
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,585
I AM TRYING TO
SAVE A JEWISH CHILD.

863
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:19,089
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY
RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE?

864
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,092
DON'T EXPECT ME TO GET
HYSTERICAL OVER THE LIFE
OF ONE JEWISH CHILD

865
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,594
AND DON'T YOU GET
HYSTERICAL, EITHER.

866
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,597
YOU'RE LATE, LADY.
YOU'RE 10 YEARS LATE.

867
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,600
ALMOST 2 MILLION
JEWISH CHILDREN WERE
BUTCHERED LIKE ANIMALS

868
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,102
BECAUSE NOBODY
WANTED THEM.

869
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:35,105
NO COUNTRY WOULD HAVE
THEM. NOT YOUR COUNTRY
OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY.

870
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,608
AND NOBODY WANTS
THE ONES WHO SURVIVED.

871
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,111
JEWISH FLESH IS CHEAP, LADY.
IT IS CHEAPER THAN BEEF.

872
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,113
IT IS CHEAPER,
EVEN, THAN HERRING.

873
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,615
YOU AND YOUR RESPECT...

874
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,118
TEL AVIV
COMPLETE NOW.

875
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,620
IF YOU CAN FIND THE
GIRL, IF SHE WANTS
TO GO WITH YOU,

876
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,123
TAKE HER. TAKE A
DOZEN IF YOU WANT TO.

877
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,626
[Crowd murmuring]

878
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:00,630
[Crowd chattering]

879
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,659
KITTY!
KITTY!

880
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:35,165
IT HAPPENED SO FAST,
I COULDN'T EVEN
LEAVE YOU A NOTE.

881
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,667
I HAD TO GO, KITTY
, TO FIND MY FATHER.

882
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,171
...
WHEN YOU ASKED ME
TO GO TO AMERICA,
I DIDN'T KNOW, AND

883
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:44,174
.
OH, KITTY, WE'RE
GOING TO PALESTINE

884
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,177
KAREN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE
IN PALESTINE.

885
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,679
AND THE BRITISH WON'T
LET YOU GO, ANYHOW.

886
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,432
THEY'LL HAVE TO, KITTY.
THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO.

887
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:55,936
.
BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT GOING BACK T
O KARAOLOS, NOT EVER

888
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:58,438
THEN LET ME TAKE
YOU TO PALESTINE.
I CAN FIND A WAY.

889
00:50:58,939 --> 00:50:59,940
THE MAN IN CHARGE, MR...

890
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,941
?
BEN CANAAN

891
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:02,442
YES.

892
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:05,946
IF YOU WANT TO
COME WITH ME, YOU
HAVE HIS PERMISSION.

893
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:08,949
TY.
I COULDN'T
LEAVE NOW, KIT

894
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:12,452
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN I
T TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

895
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:16,456
.
BUT WE ALL CAME HERE
TOGETHER, AND NOW WE'R
E TRYING TO DO SOMETHING

896
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:18,458
TY.
AND I MUST
STAY HERE, KIT

897
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:21,962
[Sutherland]
GEN. SUTHERLAND
CALLING THE OLYMPIA.

898
00:51:22,963 --> 00:51:25,966
THIS IS THE EXODUS.
COME IN, GENERAL.

899
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,968
I HAVE RECEIVED
INSTRUCTIONS

900
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:29,469
FROM THE COLONIAL
OFFICE IN LONDON.

901
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:32,472
NO ATTEMPT
WILL BE MADE TO
BOARD THE OLYMPIA,

902
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,975
BUT THE HARBOR
WILL REMAIN BLOCKED.

903
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:38,478
H.
YOU MAY RETURN
TO KARAOLOS
WHENEVER YOU WIS

904
00:51:38,478 --> 00:51:40,981
,
IF YOU CHOOSE TO
REMAIN IN THE SHIP

905
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:42,983
PROVISIONS AND
MEDICAL SUPPLIES

906
00:51:42,983 --> 00:51:44,985
WILL BE SENT TO YOU
AS YOU NEED THEM.

907
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:46,486
MESSAGE COMPLETED.

908
00:51:46,486 --> 00:51:47,988
NOT EVEN NOW?

909
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:50,490
KITTY,

910
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,492
.
I COULDN'T

911
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:55,996
IT'S--IT'S LIKE LEAVING
YOUR FAMILY WHEN
THINGS ARE BAD.

912
00:51:57,998 --> 00:51:58,999
I KNOW.

913
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,002
IF YOU WANT ANYTHING,
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW?

914
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:05,005
YES.
GEN. SUTHERLAND'S
YOUR FRIEND.

915
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:07,507
.
TELL HIM TO LE
T US GO TO PALESTINE

916
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:17,017
THEY'RE JUST GOING
TO TURN THIS SHIP

917
00:52:17,017 --> 00:52:18,518
INTO ANOTHER
CONCENTRATION CAMP.

918
00:52:23,023 --> 00:52:25,525
[Man]
GO BACK? NONSENSE.

919
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:29,029
[Man]
DID WE ESCAPE FOR
JUST OURSELVES ALONE? NO.

920
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:33,033
WE'VE DONE IT FOR
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF JEWS ALL OVER EUROPE

921
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:34,534
WHO COULDN'T GET OUT.

922
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:36,536
ALSO IT MAKES NEWS.
WORLD NEWS.

923
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:40,040
[Ari]
I WANT YOUR ATTENTION
FOR A MINUTE.

924
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,543
NOW YOU ALL
HEARD GEN. SUTHERLAND
ON THE LOUDSPEAKER.

925
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:46,046
YOU MUST NOW
MAKE A DECISION.

926
00:52:46,046 --> 00:52:47,547
YOU CAN GO BACK
TO KARAOLOS...

927
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:51,551
THE ONLY WAY TO
GO BACK TO KARAOLOS
IS BY CRAWLING!

928
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,553
...OR YOU CAN STAY
ABOARD THIS SHIP.

929
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:57,057
WHO ARE YOU MAKING
THE PROPAGANDA FOR?
THEM OR US?

930
00:52:57,057 --> 00:52:59,559
[Crowd cheering]

931
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,064
QUIET, PLEASE.
THERE'S ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY.

932
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,566
YOU WERE PICKED BY
HAGANAH FOR THIS SHIP

933
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:08,568
SO THAT YOUR
ESCAPE TO PALESTINE

934
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,570
WOULD HAVE SOME
MEANING TO THE WORLD.

935
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:13,073
NOW, IF YOU STILL WANT IT
TO HAVE SOME MEANING,

936
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:15,075
IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO
FINISH WHAT WE BEGAN,

937
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:17,077
YOU CAN GO ON A
HUNGER STRIKE.

938
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:19,579
[Man]
NOW YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO MAKE A LITTLE SENSE!

939
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,084
WE SHALL TELL TO THE BRITISH,
"WE SPIT ON YOUR FOOD."

940
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:27,087
[Crowd cheering]

941
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:31,591
RD.
AND THE LITTLE
FOOD WE'VE GOT HERE,
WE SHALL THROW OVERBOA

942
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:33,093
[Cheering]

943
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:39,099
WE ARE GOING TO PALESTINE,
OR WE'RE GOING
TO DIE RIGHT HERE.

944
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,101
[Cheering]

945
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:44,104
LISTEN. LISTEN, PLEASE.

946
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,107
NOW JUST STOP AND
THINK FOR A MINUTE.

947
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:49,109
TO GO ON A
HUNGER STRIKE

948
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:51,111
IS A VERY
SERIOUS BUSINESS,

949
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,113
BECAUSE ONCE YOU STRIKE

950
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:55,615
IT CAN ONLY END
WHEN YOU HAVE WON
OR WHEN YOU ARE DEAD.

951
00:53:55,615 --> 00:54:00,120
WHAT IS SO UNUSUAL
ABOUT THE JEWS DYING?
IS THAT ANYTHING NEW?

952
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:03,123
I STAY RIGHT HERE.

953
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:06,126
THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR US TO GO ON LIVING

954
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:09,129
UNLESS WE START
FIGHTING RIGHT NOW.

955
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:12,132
SO THAT EVERY JEW ON
THE FACE OF THE EARTH

956
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:15,135
CAN BEGIN TO START FEELING
LIKE A HUMAN BEING AGAIN.

957
00:54:15,135 --> 00:54:17,137
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

958
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:19,139
FIGHT, NOT BEG!

959
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:20,640
FIGHT!

960
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:22,142
[Cheering]

961
00:54:24,644 --> 00:54:26,146
WAIT A MINUTE, PLEASE.

962
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,649
EVERYBODY ABOARD THIS SHIP

963
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,153
AGREED TO ACCEPT
HAGANAH DISCIPLINE.

964
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:35,655
I AM NOW GIVING AN ORDER.

965
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:37,657
WE WILL SIT DOWN

966
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:41,161
AND WE WILL MAINTAIN
SILENCE FOR 20 MINUTES.

967
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:44,164
EACH ONE OF US WILL
LISTEN TO HIS OWN HEART

968
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:46,666
AND TO HIS BRAIN, TOO.

969
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,668
AND THEN WE WILL VOTE.

970
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:52,172
WE WILL NOW MAINTAIN SILENCE.

971
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,689
I SAW THE PEOPLE
ON THAT SHIP.

972
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:13,693
THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS.
THEY'RE JUST POOR,
MISERABLE PEOPLE.

973
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:16,196
WHY CAN'T YOU
LET THEM GO?

974
00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:18,198
YOU MUST UNDERSTAN
D THAT WE BRITISH

975
00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:19,699
HAVE SHOWN
, THROUGHOUT
OUR HISTORY,

976
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,204
AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT
FOR TROUBLESOME
COMMITMENTS.

977
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:27,707
S
PALESTINE IS
A BRITISH MANDAT
E IMPOSED UPON U

978
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,709
NS,
BY THE LEAGUE OF NATIO

979
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:33,213
WHICH MAKES US
RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING
PEACE IN THE AREA.

980
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:35,215
CE
THE ARABS SIMPLY
WON'T KEEP THE PEA

981
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:37,717
.
IF WE ALLOW FURTHE
R JEWISH IMMIGRATION

982
00:55:37,717 --> 00:55:40,220
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE MANDATE,

983
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:44,224
BUT I DO KNOW THE
JEWS WERE PROMISED A
HOMELAND IN PALESTINE.

984
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:48,228
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR
, BRITAIN NEEDED AND
ACCEPTED JEWISH SUPPORT

985
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,230
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

986
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,731
BUT IN RETURN,

987
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:55,735
E.
THE BALFOUR
DECLARATION OF 1917
MADE SUCH A PROMIS

988
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:59,239
THAT PROMISE WAS RECONFIRMED
DURING WORLD WAR II.

989
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,241
G
THIS CHAP BEN CANAAN
PROBABLY WASN'T LYIN

990
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:03,243
WHEN HE SAID HE
FOUGHT WITH US.

991
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:05,745
ID.
THOUSANDS OF
PALESTINIANS D

992
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:09,749
HOW CAN YOU PROMISE SOMETHING
AND THEN NOT DELIVER IT?

993
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:13,253
.
ENGLAND WAS FIGHTING
FOR HER LIFE IN 1917

994
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:16,756
NATIONS ARE VERY LIKE PEOPLE
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.

995
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:20,260
THEY MAKE PROMISES
THEY'RE NOT IMMEDIATELY
ABLE TO FULFILL.

996
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,263
DURING THAT SAME CRISIS,
WE MADE THE ARABS
CERTAIN ASSURANCES.

997
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:26,266
HENCE, THEY HAVE
THEIR CLAIMS, TOO.

998
00:56:26,266 --> 00:56:30,270
THE ARABS ARE FANATICS
ON THE SUBJECT OF
JEWISH IMMIGRATION.

999
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,772
JUST NOW, WE
NEED THEIR GOODWILL.

1000
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:34,274
HOW IS IT EVER
GOING TO END?

1001
00:56:34,274 --> 00:56:36,276
I DON'T KNOW.

1002
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:39,279
THE WHOLE QUESTION NOW I
S BEFORE THE UNITED NATIONS.

1003
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,281
.
I HOPE THEY SOLVE IT

1004
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:45,285
THE SOONER I STOP
OPERATING DETENTION CAMPS,
THE HAPPIER I'LL BE.

1005
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:48,788
THAT GOES FOR
EVERY BRITISH OFFICER
AND SOLDIER I KNOW.

1006
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,209
[Sutherland]
THANK YOU.

1007
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,211
YES?

1008
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:57,714
THE DEVIL.

1009
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,216
OF COURSE.

1010
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:03,720
SEND A BOAT
ALONGSIDE AT ONCE. I'LL
JOIN YOU IN 10 MINUTES.

1011
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,224
THEY WANT TO SEND 23
PEOPLE BACK TO KARAOLOS.

1012
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:11,227
THE REST HAVE
DECLARED A
HUNGER STRIKE.

1013
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,733
CAN I DROP YOU
AT YOUR HOTEL?

1014
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,734
OF COURSE.

1015
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:02,278
[Reuben]
...A FEW NEWS BULLETINS,
AND AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

1016
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,280
THE EVACUATION OF
2,000 BRITISH WOMEN

1017
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,783
AND CHILDREN
FROM PALESTINE

1018
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,285
WAS ORDERED TODAY
BY THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.

1019
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,788
THE UNITED NATIONS
COMMISSION ON PALESTINE

1020
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,791
STILL HAS NOT
SUBMITTED ITS REPORT.

1021
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,793
THE GRAND MUFTI OF JERUSALEM,

1022
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,295
WHO SAT OUT THE WAR AS
HITLER'S GUEST IN BERLIN,

1023
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,798
HAS MET IN
ALEY, LEBANON,

1024
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,800
WITH REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE ARAB NATIONS

1025
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,803
TO COORDINATE ACTION
AGAINST PALESTINIAN JEWS

1026
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,306
IN THE EVENT
PARTITION IS GRANTED.

1027
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,809
THE U.N. COMMISSION
ON PALESTINE

1028
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,811
HAS ARRIVED AT
FLUSHING MEADOWS

1029
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,312
AND IS NOW
PREPARING ITS FINAL

1030
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,815
RECOMMENDATION FOR
THE ASSEMBLY.

1031
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,817
NEWS OF THE HUNGER
STRIKE ABOARD THE EXODUS

1032
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,819
RECEIVED
FRONT-PAGE TREATMENT

1033
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,320
THIS MORNING
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

1034
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,322
THE BRITISH EMBASSY
IN WASHINGTON

1035
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,825
IS ALREADY
BEING PICKETED.

1036
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,327
NOW DR. ODENHEIM HAS
SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU

1037
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,329
FOR THE MEDICAL
COMMITTEE.

1038
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:57,834
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
THAT WE SAVE OUR
SUPPLY OF FRESH WATER.

1039
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:02,338
.
SO WE MUST RATION IT.
EVERY 4 HOURS, ONE CUP

1040
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:05,842
ON THE OTHER HAND,
EVERYONE MUST
WASH HIS BODY DAILY.

1041
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,344
.
THIS WILL BE
DONE WITH SEAWATER

1042
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:12,849
YOUR PLATOON LEADER WILL CALL
WHEN YOUR TURN COMES.

1043
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,853
IT IS ADVISED TO
CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY.

1044
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:20,356
SO ALL
NECESSARY PHYSICAL WORK
SHOULD BE DIVIDED

1045
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,360
.
AMONG AS MANY
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE

1046
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,863
D
IF AT ANY TIME YOU
SHOULD FEEL LIGHTHEADE

1047
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,865
OR DIZZY, DO NOT
BE FRIGHTENED.

1048
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,367
IT IS, IN NO
RESPECT, SERIOUS.

1049
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:36,372
.
JUST SIT DOWN
AND LOWER YOUR HEA
D BETWEEN YOUR KNEES

1050
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,875
.
ALL OF US, OF COURSE,
FEEL STOMACH PANGS

1051
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,878
THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE,
BUT NOT DANGEROUS.

1052
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:42,879
THAT'S RIGHT.

1053
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,881
FINAL POINT,

1054
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:48,384
PEOPLE CAN LIVE A
LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD,
A VERY LONG TIME.

1055
00:59:54,274 --> 00:59:58,778
.
HERE IS THE NEWS,
AND SOME OF IT, I'

WINSTON CHURCHILL
HAS CALLED ON

1063
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,796
THE LABOR GOVERNMENT TO
END WHAT HE CALLS

1064
01:00:16,796 --> 01:00:19,299

1065
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:20,800

I THINK YOU CARRY

01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,836
FANATICS!

1081
01:00:56,836 --> 01:01:00,840
...ESTABLISHMENT
OF A JEWISH STATE
IN THE HOLY LAND.

1082
01:01:01,274 --> 01:01:04,277
13 LEADERS OF
OUR NATIONAL
COMMITTEE IN TEL AVIV

1083
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:06,279
HAVE BEGUN A
HUNGER STRIKE

1084
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:08,281
IN SYMPATHY WITH
THE EXODUS.

1085
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:12,785
WHEN MORE NEWS COMES
IN, I'LL REPORT IT.
THAT'S ALL.

1086

HAVE YOU TIME
FOR ME, ARI?

1087
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:17,290
ALWAYS, DR. ODENHEIM.
WHAT CAN I DO?

1088
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,292
E,
WE MADE A MISTAK

1089
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:22,795
A BAD MISTAKE IN
LETTING THE CHILDR
EN BE A PART OF THIS.

1090
01:01:22,795 --> 01:01:24,797
.
A CHILD'S BODY
GROWS EVERY HOUR

1091
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:27,300
.
THEY NEED FOOD
MORE THAN ADULTS

1092
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,802
THEIR BLOOD
REQUIRES MORE SUGAR.

1093
01:01:29,802 --> 01:01:31,804
WHAT SHOULD WE
DO ABOUT IT?

1094
01:01:31,804 --> 01:01:35,308
,
WHEN A MISTAKE I
S MADE, YOU ADMIT IT

1095
01:01:35,308 --> 01:01:37,810
.
YOU ANALYZE IT
, AND YOU CORRECT IT

1096
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:41,314
DOCTOR, DON'T
YOU FEEL WELL?

1097
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:43,816
WHO CARES IF AN
OLD MAN FEELS WELL?

WHAT IS THIS?

1104
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,363
INFORMATION, SIR.

1105

INFORMATION
FOR WHOM?

1106
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:36,869
FOR THE TOURISTS, OF
COURSE. ONE OF OUR MANY
SPECIAL SERVICES.

1107
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:40,373
AND I SUPPOSE
THESE ARE TOURISTS?

1108
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:43,376
OH, NO, SIR.
THESE PEOPLE
ARE CONTRIBUTORS.

1109
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:46,379
WE ARE COLLECTING
DONATIONS FOR THE RED CROSS.

1110
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:47,380
AH, FORGIVE ME.

1111
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,382
ek]
[Both speaking Gre

1112
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:01,894
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
W-WHAT WERE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

1113
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:03,896
I SAID TO HIM,

1114
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:06,399
"
"THESE ARE NICE FAT
ONES, FOR THIS THE
ARCHBISHOP WILL BLESS YOU.

1115
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:08,901
HE SAID TO ME,
"I DO MY SHARE."

1116
01:03:09,402 --> 01:03:11,404
WORD FOR WORD, A
LITERAL TRANSLATION.

1117
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:14,907
DON'T TRY TO DECEIVE ME.
YOU'RE COLLECTING ALL
THIS STUFF FOR THE OLYMPIA.

1118
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,909
AH, YOU CAN SEE
THROUGH ME LIKE
A PIECE OF GLASS.

1119
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,911
WELL, IT'S
A COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME.

1120
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:20,913
THEY WON'T ACCEPT
FOOD FROM US, THEY WON'T
ACCEPT IT FROM YOU EITHER.

1121
01:03:21,414 --> 01:03:24,917
TRUE, TRUE, BUT, UH, THEY
WILL ACCEPT FROM THE RED
CROSS WHEN THEY SAIL.

1122
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,919
PERHAPS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1123
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:31,924
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WHEN THEY SAIL"?

1124
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:35,928
IT WAS MY POOR WAY OF
EXPRESSING CONFIDENCE
IN BRITISH JUSTICE.

1125
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:38,431
GOOD DAY.

1126
01:03:53,446 --> 01:03:56,949
YOU'D BETTER G
O UP AND TELL THEM
. GIVE ME A HAND HERE.

1127

01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:13,025
OUT TO THE SHIP
ONCE MORE, EH?

1145
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:15,027
YES.

1146
01:05:15,027 --> 01:05:17,530
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE IN
THEIR 92ND HOUR, AND
STARTING TO CRACK ALREADY.

1147
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,531
I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT.

1148
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:20,533
MM-HMM,
FADING FAST.

1149
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,535
THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE
STARTED THIS NONSENSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

1150
01:05:22,535 --> 01:05:24,537
M.
IF THAT CHAP BEN CANAAN
HADN'T HELD A GUN TO THE

1151
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:26,038
DO YOU REALLY
THINK SO?

1152
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:27,540
UNDOUBTEDLY.

1153
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,543
POOR, RUDDY BEGGARS.
I DON'T SEE HOW
YOU STAND THEM.

1154
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:41,554
THEN LET ME
ASK YOU THIS,
IF I MAY.

1155
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:44,056
E?
DO YOU HAVE
THE POWER TO C
ALL OFF THIS STRIK

1156
01:05:44,056 --> 01:05:45,057
I HAVE.

1157
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,061
IF A COMPELLING
REASON TURNED UP. WHY?

1158
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:49,562
[Baby crying]

1159
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:51,564
.
THEN CAL
L IT OFF

1160
01:05:51,564 --> 01:05:54,066
.
I'VE BEEN TALK
ING TO GEN. SUTHERLAND

1161
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:57,570
O.
HE'S A HUM
ANE MAN, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING HE CAN D

1162
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:00,573
YOU'VE MADE TH
E ISSUE SO FLATLY THAT
NO ONE CAN HELP YOU.

1163
01:06:00,573 --> 01:06:04,076
I KNOW IT, I FEEL IT.
EITHER YOU COMPROMISE,
OR YOU LOSE.

1164
01:06:05,578 --> 01:06:07,580
WE WON'T LOSE.

1165
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:10,082
IF THE BRITISH GIVE IN
AND LET US GO, WE'VE WON.

1166
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:13,586
AND IF WE STARVE TO
DEATH ABOARD THIS SHIP,
WE'VE STILL WON.

1167
01:06:13,586 --> 01:06:15,087
IT.
THEY'LL WA

1168
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:17,590
THEY'LL WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE T
OO WEAK TO RESIST

1169
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,091
AND THEN COME
ABOARD AND THEY'LL
TAKE YOU OFF.

1170
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:24,096
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH
STRENGTH TO SET OFF 200
POUNDS OF DYNAMITE.

1171
01:06:24,096 --> 01:06:26,599
YOU MEAN, YOU'
D STILL SET IT O
FF, KNOWING YOU'VE LOST?

1172
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:28,601
OF COURSE.

1173
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:32,605
WITHOUT ANY REGARD
FOR THE LIVES YOU'D
BE DESTROYING?

1174
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:35,608
WITH EVERY REGARD IN
THE WORLD FOR THEM.

1175
01:06:35,608 --> 01:06:37,610
.
I DON'
T UNDERSTAND

1176
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,113
EACH PERSON ON BOARD
THIS SHIP IS A SOLDIER.

1177
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:45,117
THE ONLY WEAPON WE
HAVE TO FIGHT WITH
IS OUR WILLINGNESS TO DIE.

1178
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,621
?
BUT FOR
WHAT PURPOSE

1179
01:06:49,622 --> 01:06:51,624
CALL IT
PUBLICITY.

1180
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:53,626
PUBLICITY?
YES, PUBLICITY.

1181
01:06:53,626 --> 01:06:56,629
A STUNT TO ATTRACT
ATTENTION.

1182
01:06:56,629 --> 01:06:59,131
A LETTER TO
THE NEWSPAPERS.

1183
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:04,637
A HELP-WANTED AD TO
THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL
OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

1184
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:08,641
Y,
"WANTED BY 600 MEN,
WOMEN AND CHILDREN, A COUNTR

1185
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:11,143
"A NATIVE LAND,
A HOME."

1186
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:13,145
THAT'S ALL
THEY'RE DYING FOR.

1187
01:07:13,646 --> 01:07:15,648
JUST TO CALL
ATTENTION TO ISRAEL

1188
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:19,652
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
SEEN IT THEMSELVES.

1189
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:22,154
DOES THE VULGARITY
OF IT SHOCK YOU?

1190
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:25,157
[Sighs]

1191
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:28,661
YOU CAN'T FIGHT TH
E WHOLE BRITISH EMPIRE
WITH 600 PEOPLE.

1192
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:30,162
IT ISN'T
POSSIBLE.

1193
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,164
HOW MANY MINUTEMEN
DID YOU HAVE AT CONCORD
THE DAY THEY FIRED

1194
01:07:32,665 --> 01:07:34,166
THE "SHOT HEARD
ROUND THE WORLD"?

1195
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:35,167
.
I DON'T KNOW

1196
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:36,168
77.

1197
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,172
E.
LOOK, PLEA
SE UNDERSTAND M

1198
01:07:41,173 --> 01:07:43,175
I WISH YOU
COULD WIN.

1199
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:47,179
I WISH IT WERE POSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO HAVE A
COUNTRY OF YOUR OWN.

1200
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:48,681
.
BUT IT ISN'T

1201
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:50,683
YOU'RE OFFERIN
G THE LIVES OF ALL
THESE PEOPLE

1202
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:52,685
.
FOR SOMETHING THAT
CAN NEVER HAPPEN

1203
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,187
E.
I KNOW. I'VE
BEEN IN PALESTIN

1204
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:57,690
WHEN WERE
YOU THERE?

1205
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,692
.
A YEAR AGO

1206
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:04,196
MR. BEN CANAAN, EVEN
IF YOU GET A PARTITI
ON AND A FREE JEWISH STATE,

1207
01:08:05,197 --> 01:08:07,199
THE ARABS WON'
T LET YOU KEEP IT.

1208
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,703
500,000 JEWS
AGAINST 50 MILLION
ARABS?

1209
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:12,705
YOU CAN'T WIN.

1210
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,210
.
YOU THINK
I'M A FOOL

1211
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,714
BUT I CAME TO APPEAL
TO YOU TO CALL OFF
THE HUNGER STRIKE

1212
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:23,215
AND AVOID
A TRAGEDY.

1213
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:25,718
WHY DON'T YOU APPEAL
TO GEN. SUTHERLAND?

1214
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:27,720
WHAT CAN I
TELL HIM?

1215
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:31,724
TELL HIM WHAT
GOD SAID TO MOSES,

1216
01:08:31,724 --> 01:08:36,729
"GO UNTO PHARAOH,
AND SAY UNTO HIM,
'THUS SAITH THE LORD,

1217
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:39,732
"'LET MY PEOPLE GO,
THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME.'"

1218
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:43,736
EXODUS, CHAPTER 7,
VERSE 26.

1219
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:50,242
WE HAVE BEEN
ASKED TO TALK TO YOU,
MR. BEN CANAAN.

1220
01:08:50,242 --> 01:08:51,744
DO YOU HAVE TIME?

1221
01:08:51,744 --> 01:08:52,745
[Ari]
OF COURSE.

1222
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:55,748
EXCUSE ME.

1223
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,764
[Woman]
WE HAVE MADE A DECISION
AMONG THE MOTHERS,

1224
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:15,267
TO SEND THE CHILDREN
BACK TO KARAOLOS NOW
WILL SHOW WEAKNESS.

1225
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:18,771
THE BRITISH WILL SEE
THAT WE ARE NOT SERIOU
S PEOPLE ABOARD THIS SHIP.

1226
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,773
.
IT DOES NOT MATTER
WHAT THE BRITISH THINK

1227
01:09:20,773 --> 01:09:22,775
I CANNOT TAKE
THE RESPONSIBILITY

1228
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:24,276
FOR LETTING CHILDREN
STARVE TO DEATH.

1229
01:09:24,276 --> 01:09:26,278
WE WILL TAKE THE
RESPONSIBILITY.

1230
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:29,782
WE WILL NOT SEND THEM
BACK, AND WE WILL NOT
GO BACK WITH THEM.

1231
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:33,285
K.
I AM SORRY, MRS. FRANK
EL. THE CHILDREN MUST GO BAC

1232
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:36,288
YOU GO BACK IF YOU
WANT TO WITH THEM.
NOW, THAT'S A HAGANAH ORDER.

1233
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:40,292
YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT MAN,
MR. ARI BEN CANAAN,
BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING.

1234
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:44,296
LOOK AT THESE BABIES OF MINE.
BORN BEHIND BARBED WIRE.

1235
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:47,800
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEY DON'T HAVE TO

1236
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,852
LOOK OUT THROUGH A
FENCE LIKE LITTLE ANIMALS.

1237
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,388
THEY ARE FREE NOW,
AND NOBODY,

1238
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:55,891
.
NO ENGLISHMAN, NO HAGANAH,
WILL EVER LOCK THEM UP AGAIN

1239
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,394
RE.
LOOK AT MRS. HIRSCHBERG HE

1240
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,897
HERS WILL BE THE FIRST,
WHEN SHE HAS NO
MORE MILK TO GIVE.

1241
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,899
TELL HIM.

1242
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,901
I WILL NOT TAKE
HIM BACK TO KARAOLOS.

1243
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,404
HE WILL GO TO
PALESTINE WITH ME,

1244
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,406
OR RIGHT HERE ON THIS SHIP,
WE WILL DIE TOGETHER.

1245
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,408
I WILL NOT TAKE
HIM BACK.

1246
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,410
I WILL NOT TAKE
HIM BACK.

1247
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,422
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO STOP THIS THING
AND LET THEM GO?

1248
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,924
T.
UNFORTUNATELY,
 I CAN'T ANSWER THA

1249
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,427
.
THE AFFAIR'S ENTIREL
Y IN THE HANDS OF LONDON

1250
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:34,430
BUT YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU
KNOW HOW WRONG IT IS.

1251
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,933
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SO?
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A
PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT IT?

1252
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:41,437
ER.
I CAN'T DO THAT,
KITTY. I'M A SOLDI

1253
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:45,441
I KNOW YOU'RE A SOLDIER,
BUT YOU'RE ALSO A JEW

1254
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,943
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE
OUT THERE ARE JEWS, TOO.

1255
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,446
Y,
I DON'T LIKE TO
DISAPPOINT YOU, KITT

1256
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:52,448
BUT I'M NOT IN
ANY DEGREE A JEW.

1257
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,450
BUT I THOUGHT...

1258
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,451
.
I KNOW THE RUMOR

1259
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,453
APPARENTLY, THERE HAD TO
BE SOME EXPLANATION

1260
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,456
S.
FOR MY ATTITUDE
TOWARDS THIS
UNPLEASANT BUSINES

1261
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:02,958
[Traffic honking]

1262
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,960
I'M SORRY FOR
FLYING OFF
LIKE THAT.

1263
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,463
.
YOU'RE GETTING TO
BE QUITE A ZIONIST

1264
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,968
FF.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M GLAD YOU DID FLY O

1265
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:16,972
WS.
YOU ASKED HOW I, A
S A JEW, COULD LET THIS
HAPPEN TO OTHER JE

1266
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:20,476
NOW I FIND MYSELF
ASKING, HOW CAN AN
Y MAN LET IT HAPPEN?

1267
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,979
,
JEW, GENTILE,
BUDDHIST, MOHAMMEDAN

1268
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,981
IS.
NO MATTER WHAT HE

1269
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,496
[Ringing]

1270
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:44,500
SIGNAL THE AIR BASE.
I'M FLYING TO LONDON
WITHIN THE HOUR.

1271
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:01,517
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AN
INTERESTING WOMAN,
MRS. FREMONT.

1272
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,520
SUTHERLAND
WON'T LET ONE MEMBER
OF THE PRESS COME ABOARD

1273
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,523
AND YOU SHUTTLE
BACK AND FORTH LIKE
A CARRIER PIGEON.

1274
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:12,027
E.
I KNOW YOU SUSPECT ME,
AND I KNOW NOTHING I
SAY CAN MAKE YOU TRUST M

1275
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:15,030
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT GEN. SUTHERLAND
HAS LEFT FOR LONDON.

1276
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,534
LP.
HE UNDERSTAN
DS YOUR SITUATION, AN
D HE IS TRYING TO HE

1277
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,535
THANKS.

1278
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,538
IS THAT ALL?

1279
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:28,544
TH.
I HEARD OF
DR. ODENHEIM'S DEA

1280
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,547
I'M A TRAINED NURSE,
AND I WORKED WITH
HIM AT KARAOLOS.

1281
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,050
IF I CAN BE USEFUL,
I'D BE GLAD TO
STAY ABOARD.

1282
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,051
WITHOUT FOOD?

1283
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,556
I THINK I CAN GO WITHOUT
FOOD AS LONG AS YOU.

1284
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,062
.
I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU
ON BOARD, MRS. FREMONT

1285
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,567
GLAD TO BE ABOARD,
MR. BEN CANAAN.

1286
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:32,107
WHATEVER MOVE YOU
MAKE, YOU WERE DEA
D 10 MINUTES AGO.

1287
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:35,110
I ASKED FOR AN
OPINION FROM ROMANIA?

1288
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,617
IN?
DO YOU THI
NK THE BRITISH
WILL GIVE

1289
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,119
WE'LL GIVE
IN FIRST.

1290
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,622
THESE SCHLEMIELS.

1291
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,625
MAYBE THEY THINK
THEY'VE BEEN HUNGRY
ONCE IN A WHILE.

1292
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:53,128
THEY DON'T EVEN BEGIN
TO KNOW WHAT REAL
STARVATION IS.

1293
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,631
DOV, IF YOU HATE
THESE PEOPLE SO MUCH,

1294
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,633
?
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO PALESTINE WITH THEM

1295
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,136
BECAUSE THERE,
JEWS FIGHT
INSTEAD OF TALK.

1296
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:07,142
WHEN I GET THERE,
I'M GOING TO JOIN
THE IRGUN.

1297
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,646
THEY KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

1298
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:14,650
I'M GOING TO BLOW
UP EVERY BRITISH
INSTALLATION I CAN FIND.

1299
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,653

1301
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,658

1302
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,660
BUT THE BRITISH
AREN'T ALL BAD, DOV.

1303
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,162
THEY'RE ROTTEN, THE
WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM.

1304
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,164
THE BRITISH,
ALL THE RUSSIANS,
ALL THE POLES--

1305
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:30,666
NOT THE DANES.
WHEN I WAS THERE--

1306
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,167
NO, THE DANES, TOO.
DON'T TELL ME.

1307
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,669
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1308
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:36,672
THE HANSENS WERE CHRISTIANS,
AND THEY ADOPTED ME.

1309
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,176
ONE EXCEPTION,
ONE LITTLE EXCEPTION.
THAT PROVES SOMETHING?

THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCEPTIONS.
YOU JUST LISTEN TO
ME FOR A MINUTE, DOV.

1311
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,684
WHEN THE NAZIS
MARCHED INTO DENMARK,

1312
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,687
ND
THEY ORDERED EVERY JEW
TO WEAR A YELLOW ARMBA

1313
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,689
WITH THE STAR OF DAVID
ON IT. AND WHEN THEY--

1314
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,190
THAT'S THE WORST
THAT CAN HAPPEN
TO A JEW?

1315
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,692
I SAID, LISTEN!

1316
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,194
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

BUT WHY SHOULD--

1322
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,709

01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,832
IT IS NATURAL THAT WE
SHOULD LIVE IN PEACE,

1462
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:54,335
SINCE EVEN OUR WORDS FOR IT
ARE ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME.

1463
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,337
WE SAY SALAAM,

1464
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,840

1465
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:02,343
LET US SEAL OUR
FRIENDSHIP FOREVER

1466

WITH THAT MOST
BEAUTIFUL OF

DOV LANDAU.

1473
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:32,874
IMMIGRATION SAYS YOU'R

REASON TO KEEP YOU.

01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:35,376
THE JEWISH AGENCY
SENT OVER A BUS TICKET

1475
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,378
YOU'RE ASSIGNED
TO GAN DAFNA.

1476
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:38,880
NOW, YOU TAKE MY
ADVICE AND GO THERE.

1477
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:41,382
DON'T HANG AROUND
HAIFA. YOU'LL ONLY
GET INTO TROUBLE.

1478
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:43,384
AND DON'T WANDER IN
THE ARAB SECTION,

1479
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:46,387
OR YOU'LL RUN INTO
THE GRAND MUFTI'S GANGSTER
AND THEY'LL KILL YOU, SON.

1480
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,389
THEY'LL SLIT
YOUR THROAT.

1481
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:50,391
AND KEEP AWAY
FROM THE IRGUN.

1482
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,404

[Women speaking]

1485
01:29:54,372 --> 01:29:56,374
ED?
[Mordekai]
AND THEN, AFTER THE
GHETTO WAS DESTROY

1486
01:29:56,874 --> 01:29:58,876
[Dov]
I HID IN THE SEWERS
FOR 5 MONTHS.

1487
01:29:58,876 --> 01:30:00,378
EATING WHAT?

1488
01:30:00,378 --> 01:30:02,380
WELL, WHEN I COULDN'T
SNEAK OUT AT NIGHT

1489
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,882
AND STEAL GARBAGE,
I--I KILLED RATS.

1490
01:30:05,883 --> 01:30:07,385
AND THEN ONE
NIGHT, THEY
CAUGHT ME.

1491
01:30:07,385 --> 01:30:08,886
AND THEY SENT
YOU TO AUSCHWITZ?

1492
01:30:08,886 --> 01:30:10,888
YES.

1493
01:30:10,888 --> 01:30:13,391
TO WHAT WORK WERE
YOU ASSIGNED
IN AUSCHWITZ?

1494
01:30:13,391 --> 01:30:15,893
I TOLD YOU THAT
TWICE ALREADY. IT
WAS MOSTLY CLEAN-UP.

1495
01:30:16,394 --> 01:30:17,895
CLEANING UP
WHAT?

1496
01:30:17,895 --> 01:30:19,397
THE CAMP AREA.

1497
01:30:19,397 --> 01:30:22,900
THAT'S ALL THERE WAS
TO DO. THAT AND--AND
WORKING IN THE KITCHENS.

1498
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,405
AND WHEN AUSCHWITZ
WAS LIBERATED, YOU
WALKED TO GERMANY?

1499
01:30:27,405 --> 01:30:29,407
YOU ASKED ME THAT
ALREADY, TOO.

1500
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:32,910
MAY I TALK WITH THE
YOUNG MAN FOR A MOMENT?

1501
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,414
SO YOU WANT TO BLOW UP
BRITISH INSTALLATIONS
FOR THE IRGUN?

1502
01:30:36,414 --> 01:30:37,415
YES.

1503
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:41,919
YOU'RE AN EXPERT
DYNAMITER, TRUE?

1504
01:30:41,919 --> 01:30:42,920
JUST TRY ME.

1505
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:47,925
THERE'S STILL A
POINT OR 2 WE DO NOT
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

1506
01:30:47,925 --> 01:30:49,427
WILL YOU ASSIST
US IN MAKING
THEM CLEAR?

1507
01:30:49,427 --> 01:30:50,928
SURE.

1508
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:55,433
AND MAKE CERTAIN
TO TELL THE TRUTH?

1509
01:30:55,433 --> 01:30:57,435
WHY SHOULDN'T I
TELL THE TRUTH?

1510
01:30:58,936 --> 01:31:01,439
.
THIS IS ALWAYS
HARD TO ANSWER

1511
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:05,943
FIRST, I WILL ASK YOU, PLEASE,
TO RECREATE FOR ME AGAIN
HOW IT WAS IN AUSCHWITZ.

1512
01:31:06,444 --> 01:31:10,448
E.
NOW, THINK MOS
T CAREFULLY ABOUT IT
, AND DESCRIBE IT TO M

1513
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:13,951
DESCRIBE WHAT?

1514
01:31:14,452 --> 01:31:15,453
E.
WHATEVER YOU LIK

1515
01:31:15,453 --> 01:31:17,455
LE
FOR INSTANCE, 
HOW IT WAS THAT PEOP

1516
01:31:17,455 --> 01:31:19,457
WERE CHOSEN TO LIVE
OR TO BE KILLED.

1517
01:31:21,959 --> 01:31:23,461
WELL...

1518
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:26,464
FIRST YOU
UNDRESSED

1519
01:31:26,964 --> 01:31:29,467
AND THEN THEY
CLIPPED YOUR HAIR.

1520
01:31:29,467 --> 01:31:32,970
AND THEN YOU ALL LINED
UP, AND YOU WENT TO
THE STATION ROOM.

1521
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:36,474
,
SO THE WAY YOU
REMEMBER IT, THEY WERE
MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN

1522
01:31:36,474 --> 01:31:39,477
D.
ALL TOGETH
ER AND ALL NAKE

1523
01:31:40,478 --> 01:31:41,479
YES.

1524
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,982
AND THEN THE
DOCTORS EXAMINED YOU

1525
01:31:44,982 --> 01:31:46,984
AND TOLD YOU
WHAT GATE TO TAKE.

1526
01:31:46,984 --> 01:31:50,488
THERE WERE...
THERE WERE 3 GATES.

1527
01:31:50,488 --> 01:31:53,991
AND IF YOU WERE TO BE
KILLED, THEN YOU WENT
THROUGH THE LEFT GATE.

1528
01:31:54,992 --> 01:31:56,494
WHICH MOST
OF THEM DID.

1529
01:31:57,495 --> 01:31:59,997
YES. YES, MOST.

1530
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:01,999
BUT IF YOU WERE
STRONG ENOUGH TO WORK,

1531
01:32:01,999 --> 01:32:04,502
THEN YOU WENT THROUGH
THE RIGHT GATE.

1532
01:32:04,502 --> 01:32:05,503
WHICH YOU DID.

1533
01:32:06,504 --> 01:32:08,005
YES.

1534
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:10,007
AND THEN THEY
ASSIGNED YOU TO--

1535
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:12,009
YOU SAID THERE
WERE 3 GATES.

1536
01:32:15,513 --> 01:32:17,014
WHO WENT THROUGH
THE 3RD GATE?

1537
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:19,016
S.
GIRL

1538
01:32:19,517 --> 01:32:20,518
ALL THE
GIRLS?

1539
01:32:21,018 --> 01:32:22,019
.
NO

1540
01:32:22,019 --> 01:32:24,522
TY.
ONLY IF THEY W
ERE YOUNG AND PRET

1541
01:32:26,023 --> 01:32:28,025
AND WHAT
HAPPENED TO THEM?

1542
01:32:28,025 --> 01:32:29,527
WELL...

1543
01:32:29,527 --> 01:32:32,029
THE S.S. GUARDS
KEPT SOME OF THEM.

1544
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:34,532
--
THEN THE REST WERE SENT
AROUND TO ARMY CAMPS FOR

1545
01:32:35,533 --> 01:32:37,034
FOR THE SOLDIERS.

1546
01:32:39,036 --> 01:32:40,538
YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

1547
01:32:40,538 --> 01:32:44,542
NOW, THOSE WHO WENT
THROUGH THE LEFT
GATE TO BE KILLED,

1548
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:48,045
HOW WAS THE
KILLING ACCOMPLISHED
IN AUSCHWITZ?

1549
01:32:48,045 --> 01:32:52,049
THEY WENT IN
TO TAKE SHOWERS,
2,000 OR 3,000 AT A TIME.

1550
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:54,552
AND THE DOORS WERE LOCKED.

1551
01:32:56,053 --> 01:32:58,055
AND THEN CAME THE GAS.

1552
01:32:58,055 --> 01:33:01,058
.
VERY PROFESSIONAL.
ONE THING I OVERLOOKED

1553
01:33:01,058 --> 01:33:03,561
NCE
YOU SAY YOU GOT TH
IS DYNAMITING EXPERIE

1554
01:33:03,561 --> 01:33:05,563
S.
IN THE WARSAW
GHETTO FIGHTING NAZI

1555
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:08,065
[Dov]
THAT'S RIGHT.

1556
01:33:08,065 --> 01:33:11,068
YOU BLEW UP QUITE A FEW NAZIS
WITH THIS DYNAMITE, HUH?

1557
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,071
ALL I COULD.

1558
01:33:16,073 --> 01:33:17,074
GOOD.

1559
01:33:17,074 --> 01:33:19,076
NOW, UH, RETURN TO
AUSCHWITZ, PLEASE.

1560
01:33:19,577 --> 01:33:22,079
E?
FROM THE GAS CHAMBER
S, THE BODIES WENT WHER

1561
01:33:25,082 --> 01:33:27,585
THE OVENS.

1562
01:33:27,585 --> 01:33:30,588
AT AUSCHWITZ,
THEY HAD CREMATORIUMS
ONLY AT THE LAST.

1563
01:33:31,088 --> 01:33:34,091
?
BEFORE THE INSTALLATIO
N OF THE OVENS, WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE BODIES

1564
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:38,095
THEY BURIED THEM.

1565
01:33:39,096 --> 01:33:40,097
HOW?

1566
01:33:41,098 --> 01:33:42,099
IN...

1567
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:45,102
IN TRENCHES AND HOLES.

1568
01:33:47,104 --> 01:33:48,105
AND WHO DUG
THE HOLES?

1569
01:33:48,606 --> 01:33:49,607
I DON'T KNOW.

1570
01:33:51,108 --> 01:33:54,111
I ASK YOU AGAIN,
WHO DUG THE GRAVES?

1571
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,622
I DON'T KNOW.

1572
01:34:09,126 --> 01:34:10,628
.
THEY HAD DEMOLITION SQUADS

1573
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:16,133
AT LEAST,
SOMETIMES THEY DID.

1574
01:34:18,135 --> 01:34:20,638
TO BLOW HOLES
IN THE GROUND,

1575
01:34:21,138 --> 01:34:23,140
THEN DUMP THE BODIES IN.

1576
01:34:24,141 --> 01:34:25,643
THAT IS CORRECT.

1577
01:34:29,647 --> 01:34:33,651
U?
NOW MAY I TELL YOU
SOMETHING, DOV LANDA

1578
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:38,155
AT NO TIME DID
THE JEWS USE DYNAMITE
IN THE WARSAW GHETTO.

1579
01:34:38,155 --> 01:34:40,157
THEY HAD NO DYNAMITE.

1580
01:34:40,658 --> 01:34:42,159
DO YOU REMEMBE
R BETTER NOW?

1581
01:34:45,663 --> 01:34:46,664
MAYBE.

1582
01:34:48,165 --> 01:34:50,668
SO IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO LEARN

1583
01:34:50,668 --> 01:34:53,170
THE USE OF DYNAMITE
IN THE WARSAW GHETTO.

1584
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:55,172

YOU LEARNED ABOUT

1591
01:35:16,193 --> 01:35:17,194
YES.

1592
01:35:19,196 --> 01:35:22,199
IT WAS THE DUTY OF

HOW CAN WE ASK THE
UNITED NATIONS
FOR A JUST DECISION

1789
01:50:00,377 --> 01:50:03,863
WHEN WE KEEP
BLOWING UP THINGS LIKE
A BUNCH OF ANARCHISTS?

1790
01:50:03,863 --> 01:50:06,800
YOU HAVE JUST USED THE
WORDS "A JUST DECISION."

1791
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,802
MAY I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

1792
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:11,304
FIRSTLY,

1793
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:14,307
JUSTICE ITSELF
IS AN ABSTRACTION,

1794
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:16,810
COMPLETELY DEVOID
OF REALITY.

1795
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,314
SECOND, TO SPEAK
OF JUSTICE AND JEWS
IN THE SAME BREATH

1796
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:24,317
IS A LOGICAL UNCERTAINTY.

1797
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:25,819
THIRDLY,

1798
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:29,322
ONE CAN ARGUE THE JUSTICE
OF ARAB CLAIMS ON PALESTINE

1799
01:50:29,823 --> 01:50:32,826
JUST AS ONE CAN ARGUE THE
JUSTICE OF JEWISH CLAIMS.

1800
01:50:33,827 --> 01:50:34,828
FOURTHLY,

1801
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:37,330
NO ONE CAN SAY THAT
THE JEWS HAVE NOT HAD

1802
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:40,333
MORE THAN THEIR
SHARE OF INJUSTICE
THESE PAST 10 YEARS.

1803
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,837
I THEREFORE SAY, FIFTHLY,

1804
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:47,340
LET THE NEXT
INJUSTICE WORK AGAINST
SOMEBODY ELSE FOR A CHANGE.

1805
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:50,343
YOU JUST CHANGED
THE SUBJECT ON ME.

1806
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:51,344
YOU NOTICED.

1807
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:54,848
I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS MORE
BOMBINGS AND MORE KILLINGS?

1808
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:56,349
I'LL PUT IT
THIS WAY.

1809
01:50:56,349 --> 01:50:58,351
LET THE
NATIONAL COMMITTEE
KEEP ON TRYING

1810
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:00,854
TO TALK THE BRITIS
H OUT OF PALESTINE.

1811
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:04,858
WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS.
WE WILL CONTINUE
TO BOMB THEM OUT.

1812
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:07,861
NOW TELL ME, HOW'S
YOUR MOTHER?

1813
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:09,863
SHE'S FINE.

1814
01:51:10,363 --> 01:51:12,365
AND LITTLE JORDANA?

1815
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:15,368
LITTLE JORDANA
JUST WON HER SECOND

1816
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:17,871
MARKSMANSHIP MEDAL
WITH THE PALMACH.

1817

1818

AND THAT YOUNG
RASCAL, DAVID BEN AMI,
SHE'S STILL INTERESTED

1819
01:51:23,877 --> 01:51:26,880
SHE CAN'T WAIT TILL HE
GETS BACK FROM CYPRUS.

1820
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,883
AND BARAK...

1821
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:33,386
STILL COUNTS MY
NAME AMONG THE DEAD
ON YOM KIPPUR?

1822
01:51:39,893 --> 01:51:41,394
10 YEARS.

1823
01:51:44,397 --> 01:51:47,901
VE.
IT'S A LONG TIME
TO BE DEAD TO THE
ONLY FAMILY YOU HA

1824
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:55,408
DOESN'T HE UNDERSTAND
THAT I MUST WORK FOR
ISRAEL IN MY WAY

1825
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:58,411
JUST AS HE WOR
KS FOR IT IN HIS?

1826
01:51:58,411 --> 01:52:00,914
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT IT. I'VE TRIED.

1827
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:03,917
OF COURSE.

1828
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:12,926
IT'S NOT MUCH
OF A HOME, IS IT?

1829
01:52:13,426 --> 01:52:16,429
WITH ONLY ROSE'S
SAMOVAR TO MAKE
A MEMORY REAL.

1830
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:34,447
EVERY TIME I COME HOME
, I STOP HERE AND JUST
LOOK FOR A MINUTE.

1831
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:35,949
YOU WANT TO
LOOK WITH ME?

1832
01:52:35,949 --> 01:52:36,950
SURE.

1833
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:33,006
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

1834

THE VALLEY
OF JEZREEL.

1835
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:40,513
IF YOU DUG STRAIGHT
DOWN FAR ENOUGH THERE,

1836
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:43,016
YOU'D FIND THE
RUINS OF MEGGIDO.

1837
01:53:43,016 --> 01:53:45,018
YOU'D FIND THE VERY
SAME PAVING STONES

1838
01:53:45,018 --> 01:53:48,021
THAT JOSHUA WALKED ON
WHEN HE CONQUERED IT.

1839

THAT'S ABU YESHA.
THAT'S AN ARAB VILLAGE
. TO THE LEFT IS GAN DAFNA

IN A PRESBYTERIAN
SORT OF WAY.

1842

THAT'S MOUNT TABOR

IT'S IN THE
BOOK OF JUDGES

ISN'T YOUR
FATHER'S NAME BARAK?

IN RUSSIA, HE
WAS YAKOV RABINSKI

HE TOOK THE NAME OF
DEBORAH'S GENERAL.

HALF OF THEM.

OF THEM THERE

WE'LL BE BACK

03:23:25,826 --> 03:23:27,328
TO PRAY
OVER KAREN.

2775
03:23:29,330 --> 03:23:32,333
TAHA SHOULD HAVE
LIVED A LONG LIFE,

2776
03:23:32,333 --> 03:23:35,836
SURROUNDED BY HI
S PEOPLE AND HIS SONS.

2777
03:23:37,838 --> 03:23:39,840
AND DEATH SHOULD
HAVE COME TO HIM

2778
03:23:40,341 --> 03:23:42,843
AS AN OLD FRIEND,

2779
03:23:42,843 --> 03:23:44,845
OFFERING THE
GIFT OF SLEEP.

2780
03:23:46,347 --> 03:23:48,849
IT CAME, INSTEAD,
AS A MANIAC.

2781
03:23:48,849 --> 03:23:52,353
AND KAREN, WHO
LOVED HER LIFE

2782
03:23:52,353 --> 03:23:56,357
?
AND WHO LIVED IT A
S PURELY AS A FLAME,
WHY DID GOD FORGET HER

2783
03:23:56,357 --> 03:23:59,360
WHY DID SHE HAVE
TO STUMBLE ONTO
DEATH SO YOUNG?

2784
03:24:00,361 --> 03:24:01,862
AND ALL ALONE?

2785
03:24:02,863 --> 03:24:04,365
AND IN THE DARK?

2786
03:24:06,867 --> 03:24:08,369
WE OF ALL PEOPLE

2787
03:24:08,369 --> 03:24:12,373
SHOULD NO LONGER B
E SURPRISED WHEN DEATH
REACHES OUT TO US.

2788
03:24:12,373 --> 03:24:16,877
NS,
WITH THE WORLD'S
INSANITY AND OUR O
WN SLAUGHTERED MILLIO

2789
03:24:16,877 --> 03:24:19,880
NG.
WE SHOULD BE USED
TO SENSELESS KILLI

2790
03:24:19,880 --> 03:24:23,884
BUT I AM NOT USED TO IT.
I CANNOT GET USED TO IT AN
D I WILL NOT GET USED TO IT.

2791
03:24:23,884 --> 03:24:25,886
I LOOK AT THESE
2 PEOPLE,

2792
03:24:25,886 --> 03:24:27,888
AND I WANT TO
HOWL LIKE A DOG.

2793
03:24:28,889 --> 03:24:31,392
I WANT TO
SHOUT "MURDER"

2794
03:24:31,392 --> 03:24:34,395
T.
SO THAT THE WHOLE
WORLD WILL HEAR IT
AND NEVER FORGET I

2795
03:24:36,897 --> 03:24:40,901
IT'S RIGHT THAT THESE 2
PEOPLE SHOULD LIE SIDE BY
SIDE IN THIS GRAVE

2796
03:24:40,901 --> 03:24:43,904
E.
BECAUSE THEY W
ILL SHARE IT IN PEAC

2797
03:24:44,405 --> 03:24:46,907
BUT THE DEAD
ALWAYS SHARE
THE EARTH IN PEACE.

2798
03:24:46,907 --> 03:24:51,412
N.
AND THAT'S NOT ENOUG
H. IT'S TIME FOR THE
LIVING TO HAVE A TUR

2799
03:24:51,412 --> 03:24:53,914
NG
A FEW MILES FROM HER
E, THERE ARE PEOPLE W
HO ARE FIGHTING AND DYI

2800
03:24:53,914 --> 03:24:56,917
AND WE MUST JOIN
THEM. BUT I SWEAR,

2801
03:24:56,917 --> 03:25:00,421
ON THE BODIES
OF THESE 2 PEOPLE,

2802
03:25:00,421 --> 03:25:03,424
THAT THE DAY WILL
COME WHEN ARAB
AND JEW WILL SHARE

2803
03:25:03,924 --> 03:25:06,427
IN A PEACEFUL LIFE

2804
03:25:06,427 --> 03:25:09,430
THIS LAND THAT
THEY HAVE ALWAYS
SHARED IN DEATH.

2805
