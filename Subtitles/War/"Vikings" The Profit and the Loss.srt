brother, uncles,

372
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:15,533
and my sons.

373
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:20,573
And here is my sainted mother.

374
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:26,992
She watched her grandsons
butchered before her eyes

375
00:38:26,993 --> 00:38:28,622
before they blinded her,

376
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:31,622
cut out her tongue, cut off her breasts,

377
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:34,283
and burnt her while she was still alive.

378
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:36,573
And who did this?

379
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,123
My family.

380
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:42,622
The ruined, corrupt, decadent dregs

381
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,993
of a once illustrious name.

382
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,412
And you shelter for your own purposes

383
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:52,453
another of my mad descendants.

384
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:53,993
Kwenthrith,

385
00:38:54,743 --> 00:38:56,572
whose only claim to the throne rests

386
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:59,622
in the murder of her own uncle
and two of her own brothers.

387
00:38:59,623 --> 00:39:04,622
I do not shelter her out of
any love for her person,

388
00:39:04,623 --> 00:39:06,993
but because I thought she might be

389
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,072
a stabilizing factor.

390
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:13,123
The last thing I needed
was a chaotic neighbor.

391
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:16,952
If you ever supposed that Kwenthrith

392
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:19,282
could play a calming, stabilizing role

393
00:39:19,283 --> 00:39:21,623
in this madhouse we call Mercia,

394
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:24,453
then you are as mad as the rest of them.

395
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:27,452
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

396
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:29,953
However, I doubt it.

397
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,323
I know your ambitions.

398
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:35,993
And to the point.

399
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:38,863
You proposed this meeting.

400
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,283
To what end?

401
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:42,953
Yes.

402
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:44,623
To the end.

403
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:45,953
Exactly.

404
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:50,662
The ruling council as
they call themselves

405
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:52,782
are a lot of fools,
monkeys and drunkards.

406
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:53,913
Mostly distant relations.

407
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,783
I say a plague on them.

408
00:39:57,823 --> 00:39:59,363
My proposal is simple.

409
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:02,623
I still have an army, of sorts.

410
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:06,912
We will join with the army you have
brought and easily, believe me,

411
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:09,913
overcome the council
and their lickspits.

412
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:12,863
And then?

413
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,203
And then I mean to renounce this world.

414
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,863
I have seen enough of its ways.

415
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:21,283
They corrupted me, I know that.

416
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,033
But how is it possible
not to be corrupted.

417
00:40:25,743 --> 00:40:27,953
I also lost my faith in God.

418
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,952
I could no longer conceive

419
00:40:30,953 --> 00:40:34,743
that our Lord could sanction
the death of everyone I loved.

420
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:38,953
But that is the road to despair.

421
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,163
And I wish before I die
to take the road of hope.

422
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,992
Therefore, after we are victorious,

423
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:47,413
I shall quit Mercia and England.

424
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,993
And travel in pilgrimage to
Rome as a common beggar.

425
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,032
I only want a chance

426
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:55,703
to redeem my sins.

427
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:02,913
And the kingdom?

428
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:08,163
Werferth, bring my mother's casket.

429
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:16,953
I shall formally renounce
the kingdom in your name.

430
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:23,413
You will afterwards be
king of Wessex and Mercia.

431
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,623
Your kingdom will be huge.

432
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:31,202
But in you I see a leader
strong and ambitious enough

433
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:33,572
to take both our countries forward

434
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,703
and defend them against our enemies.

435
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,783
Especially the Northmen.

436
00:41:40,203 --> 00:41:41,283
Open it.

437
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:50,703
This was once the ancestral
crown of Mercia.

438
00:41:52,453 --> 00:41:53,953
Now it will be your crown,

439
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:56,413
King Ecbert.

(LOTHBROK BREATHING HEAVILY)

441

We have waited three days
for a plan of attack.

442
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:29,122
The longer we wait, the more
chances the Franks will attack us.

443
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:30,662
What is your decision?

Yes.
