1
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,635
After twenty days of continuous bombing,

2
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:10,374
Nanking finally fell to the Japonese.

3
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:14,114
It was December the 13th, 1937.

4
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:14,797
I remember

5
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:17,201
everyone was running that day,

6
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:20,511
but no one could escape that heavy fog.

7
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,143
Major li only had a few men left.

8
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:29,315
Nanking was no longer
able to put up a fight,

9
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,741
and those left behind,
ran for their lives.

10
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:00,656
Stop counting.

11
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,773
Shu and two other are missing.

12
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,086
Let us in!

13
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,045
There's no room!

14
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:45,989
Find your own place to hide!

15
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:47,784
I said, there's no more room!

16
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,602
Let's go.

17
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,505
Keep going!

18
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:18,876
Hey.

19
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,856
There are people inside.

20
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:22,776
Who is there?

21
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:23,776
Come out!

22
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:26,474
Come out!

23
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:32,826
Bastards!

24
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:35,856
Go to hell!

25
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,087
Stop!

26
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,086
Turn around!

27
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,797
Turn around!

28
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,194
Don't move!

29
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:53,875
American.

30
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,875
From the refuge.

31
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,475
What?

32
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,725
American.

33
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,418
Not soldier.

34
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:05,826
Jhon Miller.

35
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:06,946
Raise your hands!

36
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,341
Working at the church.

37
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:09,494
Raise your hands!

38
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,594
I said raise your hands!

39
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:46,385
Separated...

40
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:49,933
You separated from your families?

41
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:54,230
You...

42
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:55,693
families...

43
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,181
separated?

44
00:06:58,522 --> 00:06:59,642
I'm...

45
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,930
going to...

46
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,787
Winchester Cathedral.

47
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:06,952
You know where it is?

48
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,665
Where?

49
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:21,934
Where?

50
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,054
Mister.

51
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,209
Did you say...

52
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:26,566
Did you say "mister?"

53
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,053
Who said "mister?"

54
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:31,223
You speak English?

55
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,760
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

56
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,095
Say that again.

57
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:40,788
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

58
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,516
You're kidding?

59
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:44,928
We are students at the convent.

60
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,490
You going there?

61
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:50,978
Why do you want to go there?

62
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:53,236
I'm helping to bury your father.

63
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,659
Well, not your father father...

64
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,279
Father Ingleman.

65
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,803
Father Ingleman, yeah.

66
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:00,775
I'm helping bury him.

67
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,618
Father Ingleman, I'm sending him off...

68
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:08,276
to heaven or wherever.

69
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:48,982
You show me the way?

70
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,102
Peng,

71
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:51,102
move to the flank,

72
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,594
move to the flank,

73
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:55,823
Dam it, are you deaf?

74
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:58,553
Major Li,

75
00:08:58,553 --> 00:09:00,173
we are the last ones left.

76
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,870
We should leave the city now.

77
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,810
Keep fighting.

78
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,208
Yes sir.

79
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,580
Got you!

80
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's go.

81
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:27,735
Yes sir.

82
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:05,999
That way!

83
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,278
Up there, on right!

84
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,453
On the left! Fire!

85
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,852
Cover them!

86
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:52,046
The Chinese army did't
have adequate weapons

87
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,966
to destroy the enemy's tanks,

88
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,086
so they employed a tactic
from ancient warfare.

89
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:58,206
They formed a human shield,

90
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,362
to get a bomb close to the tanks.

91
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,582
At the time, the Chinese people

92
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,082
couldn't bear the thought
of their country,

93
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,650
and such selfless acts were not uncommon.

94
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,567
Zhen!

95
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,042
Let me go!

96
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,670
Zhen!

97
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:06,609
Come on!

98
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,729
Father ingleman...

99
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:08,914
fly away.

100
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,578
Fly away?

101
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:15,005
On here, Japanese, bomb.

102
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:15,925
He flew away with the bomb, right.

103
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,646
Yes.

104
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:20,961
Why was the deceased out here?

105
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,089
- Gu. All because of Gu.
- Gu?

106
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,799
He said, bad smell.

107
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,100
He moved the body here.

108
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:29,036
Who's Gu?

109
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,807
Gu is our cook.

110
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,567
He ran away.

111
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,187
He leaves some students here.

112
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,907
Some students took away by parents.

113
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,324
Some students nowhere to go.

114
00:17:41,572 --> 00:17:42,692
So who's inside?

115
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,601
Just you and the girls?

116
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:49,196
Just you and the girls.

117
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:50,984
Even without a body,

118
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,086
you gotta pay me.

119
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:54,506
No.

120
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:55,136
No, no, no, no... You gotta pay me.

121
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,078
No.

122
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,068
That's the rule.

123
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,488
There's nothing I can do about it.

124
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:01,608
With what I came through,

125
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,919
I should raise the price.

126
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,259
So is the money inside?

127
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:05,379
No. No money.

128
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,371
Money? Inside?

129
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:07,918
No.

130
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:09,343
Come on.

131
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:09,986
There's no money inside?

132
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,686
No.

133
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:12,177
Let's look.

134
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:13,777
It's a Catholic church.

135
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:14,377
There's gotta be some cash inside.

136
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:15,336
No.

137
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,036
No?

138
00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:19,713
You say anything but no?

139
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:23,323
Can you fix truck?

140
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:24,685
Help us.

141
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,007
Leave Nanking.

142
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,900
Fix this truck?

143
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:29,917
For free?

144
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,709
No.

145
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:33,829
I can take parts, sell parts.

146
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,029
You got tools?

147
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:36,715
No.

148
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,604
Let's get inside.

149
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,224
Zhen didn't even make a noise.

150
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,144
Even when they stabbed her over and over,

151
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:52,527
yet she didn't make a noise.

152
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,060
It's all my fault.

153
00:18:55,229 --> 00:18:56,549
It's not your fault.

154
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,101
It is your fault.

155
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,621
Your father promised to take us

156
00:19:02,894 --> 00:19:03,714
on boat and leave Nanking.

157
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:05,382
Where is he?

158
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:07,477
He ran off.

159
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,597
We waited and waited,

160
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,597
and now the Japanese are here.

161
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,717
Now the Japanese are everywhere,

162
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,254
and it's too late to go to the refuge.

163
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:20,683
Zhen died because of your father!

164
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,177
Shut up!

165
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:23,877
What are you doing?

166
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:26,228
Stop!

167
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:28,941
Stop fighting!

168
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:30,305
Hey.

169
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:34,255
Hey.

170
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,068
Hey! Stop!

171
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,687
Stop!

172
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,018
I'm Jhon. Hi.

173
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:46,883
I'm American.

174
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,279
He's the mortician for Father's funeral.

175
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,575
I know it's hard.

176
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:57,195
But you've gotta stop fighting everybody.

177
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,116
You know you two... you've seen enough...

178
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:09,178
seen enough tragedy for a lifetime today.

179
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,520
I can't... um...

180
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,763
I'm not good with kids.

181
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:14,816
Let's go.

182
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:17,336
You want some flour? You like some flour?

183
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:19,263
- Make some bread for the girls.
- Buns.

184
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:20,283
Buns.

185
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:22,103
Buns, whatever.

186
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,940
Let's go find the collection box.

187
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:29,821
Where?

188
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,341
- Upstairs?
- No.

189
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
Oh, nice.

190
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:38,973
Forget going back to the refuge,

191
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,693
I think I'm bunking here tonight.

192
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,235
He's grim, who's that?

193
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:51,656
- Is that Father Ingleman?
- Yes.

194
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:52,276
These North Europeans they're all like,

195
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,477
you know, tuna, playwright,

196
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:56,467
not much fun.

197
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,527
Look at that face,

198
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,949
he's ruining the...

199
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,086
What do you call it? Feng... Fengshui?

200
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:06,205
I can't have a priest staring at me

201
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:10,208
- While I'm sleeping.
- No...

202
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:11,836
My father.

203
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:14,669
Me...

204
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:18,471
orphan...

205
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:20,008
adopted.

206
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:21,555
I'm sorry.

207
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:22,672
But I just...

208
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:23,608
It's not good for me to have a priest

209
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:26,930
staring at me while I'm sleeping.

210
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,375
I can't.

211
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,806
Please, I gotta just... there, better.

212
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,251
- You got any drink around here?
- No.

213
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,247
You're a church. You got wine, something?

214
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:36,075
Nothing.

215
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,317
Nothing?

216
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:39,407
- No.
- No, no...

217
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,524
That's a shaving kit.

218
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,252
What a jerk!

219
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:54,071
I said you are a jerk!

220
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:55,949
What did you say your name was?

221
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,096
George Chen.

222
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,999
George.

223
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:03,248
Tomorrow,

224
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,415
you fix truck,

225
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,241
hels us.

226
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:08,229
Fix truck?

227
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,626
No money!

228
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,253
Money, George.

229
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:16,101
Gu.

230
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:18,814
Open the door, It's Ling.

231
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:25,281
Can you hear me?

232
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,654
Gu.

233
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:29,242
Open up.

234
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:31,378
It's Ling.

235
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:32,785
Did you really make a deal with him?

236
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,389
Of course.

237
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,233
Otherwise I wouldn't
have brought you here.

238
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:36,984
Gu.

239
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,981
Open the door, it's Ling.

240
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,202
Gu, have you gone deaf?

241
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,901
Someone's here.

242
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,347
Where's Gu? Ask him to come out.

243
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:47,077
Go to the refuge on the west side.

244
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:48,578
Leave now, go to the refuge.

245
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,069
No, we're here for Gu.

246
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,070
Gu's not here.

247
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,071
Bullshit! Get out of my way!

248
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,071
Gu told me,

249
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:56,372
this church is protection.

250
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:57,573
The Japanese can't come in.

251
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:59,174
Bastard! I served Gu all night for free,

252
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,575
he promised to let us stay.

253
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:03,064
Ask that bastard Gu to come out!

254
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,065
He's really not here.

255
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,466
How come?

256
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,467
He ran off this morning.

257
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,368
You should go to the refuge.

258
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,669
We're not leaving.

259
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,320
Hey! How dare you!

260
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:31,421
Hurry.

261
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:48,064
Go to the refuge!

262
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:50,065
To the refuge!

263
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,566
The refuge doesn't even
have space left for maggots.

264
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:52,567
Please, have some mercy and let us in.

265
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:55,368
Don't jump.

266
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,769
They're from the red-light district.

267
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,370
What's that?

268
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,171
It means brothel.

269
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,172
They were the famous
women of the Qin Huai River.

270
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:31,173
The myths surrounding them

271
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:40,374
were as ancient as the city of Nanking.

272
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,375
That's a Westerner!

273
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:45,375
Is he a priest?

274
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,176
No way.

275
00:24:53,177 --> 00:24:54,877
What kind of priest would be such a flirt?

276
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:56,068
Who cares,

277
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:58,069
as long as he can protect us.

278
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,070
True.

279
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,072
Come up here.

280
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:02,073
This was stolen from the bowels of hell.

281
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,074
Long time not make bread.

282
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:42,075
Long time not make bread? No bread?

283
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,076
Not tonight, tonight we're having bread.

284
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,477
These women quickly took over the cellar.

285
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:50,378
It was once a filthy, messy place,

286
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:55,879
but within hours,

287
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:59,064
they had transformed it
into the Qin Huai River.

288
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,365
The fragrance of rouge and perfume

289
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:03,266
danced up through the air.

290
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:03,416
I can smell the bread.

291
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,067
We are coming up!

292
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,168
I couldn't stop them.

293
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,769
Hello.

294
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:45,069
I remember

295
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,070
when I first saw these women,

296
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,071
they were tramps, parading
around in their lingerie,

297
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,872
not the graceful ladies that
the legends of Qin Huai

298
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:59,863
had portrayed them to be.

299
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,864
Look, this should be good.

300
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:03,265
George,

301
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,066
you little shit,

302
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,063
you said there was no wine here.

303
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,564
Excuse me.

304
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,565
What's he saying?

305
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,566
Holy hooch!

306
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,567
How dare you drink the wine!

307
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:39,068
Now the Westerner Knows about the wine.

308
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:41,869
We sell the wine to raise
money for orphans.

309
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,170
We're all orphans.

310
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:45,063
We also need help.

311
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,064
That's right.

312
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,065
What are they saying?

313
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,066
They said they're orphans!

314
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,567
Orphans?

315
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,068
Well, I'd like to adopt all of you,

316
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:53,069
right now.

317
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,070
Adopt all of us?

318
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,071
You would not be able to cope.

319
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:57,572
You are not the only
ones who speak English!

320
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,073
That's right!

321
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:05,074
You speak English?

322
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:06,575
The Westerner is a playboy.

323
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:09,576
Of course! Haven't you heard?

324
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,876
Westerners with beards are the horniest!

325
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:26,277
No wonder she is the top
girl of the Qin Huai River.

326
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,578
Mo, use all of your skills.

327
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,179
Seduce him!

328
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
That's right.

329
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,581
Make the gig nose go crazy for us!

330
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:36,582
My name is Jhon.

331
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:40,583
And you are?

332
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,584
Yu Mo.

333
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:52,065
Yu Mo.

334
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,066
I like that.

335
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,067
So what do you and your companions do?

336
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,068
We are kindergarten teachers.

337
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,869
Really? Kindergarten teachers.

338
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,070
Shameless.

339
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:05,071
And You?

340
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:06,072
What do you do?

341
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:07,073
I'm also a kindergarten teachers.

342
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:08,074
So as,

343
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:10,075
teacher to teacher,

344
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,876
you wanna...

345
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,077
get together and have a cup of joe, or...

346
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:17,078
What's those two yapping about?

347
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,079
Tell me.

348
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,380
Nothing. He's asking your price.

349
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:22,071
I told him.

350
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:24,872
He thinks you are too cheap.

351
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:25,873
There's no coffee.

352
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:28,874
Let's get liquored up.

353
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,174
Cheers.

354
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,175
The kindergarten fee is anought?

355
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:25,176
You coming?

356
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:30,177
I want you to take us out of Nanking.

357
00:30:41,878 --> 00:30:43,061
Yeah.

358
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:48,062
Right.

359
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,063
We do this first?

360
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,064
I'm serious.

361
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,415
Why else you think we
were flirting with you?

362
00:30:58,416 --> 00:30:59,416
Out of Nanking, how?

363
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:03,067
I don't know how,

364
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:07,568
but I know your face is
the way out of here.

365
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,069
The Japanese won't touch Westerners.

366
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,070
Did you see it out there?

367
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,071
That's not happening.

368
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:18,072
No.

369
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:19,773
Cash enough?

370
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:23,061
Cause... let's...

371
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:25,062
Are you kidding?

372
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,063
Are you kidding?

373
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,064
Wait...

374
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,065
Let's work this out. Let's work it out.

375
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,066
Think about it.

376
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,367
If you help us,

377
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,368
I will thank you in ways

378
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:48,069
you can never imagine.

379
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,870
All of us will.

380
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:52,171
Can I get an advance?

381
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:55,062
The Japanese have posted a notice,

382
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:59,062
whoever harbors soldiers will be shot.

383
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,063
I'll shoot you first.

384
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:27,064
Littles bastard.

385
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:28,965
Open up. Carry that guy in.

386
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,566
Get up.

387
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,167
Get some water.

388
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,568
Hurry up!

389
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:12,869
What a temper.

390
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,870
He think he's so tough.

391
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:25,060
He thinks he's a hero.

392
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,361
Since he's fighting the Japanese,

393
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,362
protecting Nanking and women like us,

394
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:31,063
he feels he is entitled to have a temper.

395
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:33,064
Women like us need to hide here.

396
00:33:33,065 --> 00:33:35,065
But if he hides here, he's a coward.

397
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:38,066
True.

398
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,067
Yeah, what a sissy!

399
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:41,068
Got scissors?

400
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:43,069
Thanks.

401
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:47,669
You ruined my dress!

402
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,060
Don't touch him!

403
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,061
Save your attitude for the Japs.

404
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:10,562
They are searching for
Chinese soldiers like you.

405
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,063
You are endangering us!

406
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:15,064
There are convent girls here, too.

407
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:15,665
Understand?

408
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,566
Towel.

409
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:18,567
What a handsome face.

410
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,068
Dou has good taste in men.

411
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:40,769
I mean he looks like my brother.

412
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,270
Are you hot for him?

413
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:46,071
No, he really looks like my brother.

414
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,572
You have a crush on him.

415
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,873
No. I don't.

416
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,474
Dou, cool off.

417
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:52,775
He doesn't even have hair down there!

418
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:53,876
He was homeless, so our troop took him in.

419
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:56,577
He's called Pu Sheng.

420
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:07,578
He's just a child.

421
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,579
Why are you leaving him with us?

422
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Get some cloth,

423
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:11,051
tighten the bandage

424
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:13,082
so he won't bleed too much.

425
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,413
It's the best I can do.

426
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:16,064
I want him to be in a warm place

427
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:18,065
before he dies.

428
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,066
Thank you.

429
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,067
Please wait.

430
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,418
What do you want?

431
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,118
We have sharp tongues,

432
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:17,719
and we were very rude.

433
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,060
I hope you can forgive us.

434
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:22,061
Don't point a gun at a man of the cloth.

435
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:24,411
Mo.

436
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:36,412
Like me as a priest? Do you?

437
00:37:39,063 --> 00:37:37,063
I dressed up for you.

438
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:43,064
I got a chance now?

439
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:45,865
Is he the priest?

440
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:48,066
Does he belong to the church?

441
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,067
You can say that.

442
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:57,368
What, the bank's closed
for me, but he gets...

443
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,369
He gets a special soldier
discount or something?

444
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,270
Please tell him,

445
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:04,571
the students can't end up

446
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,572
in the hands of the Japanese.

447
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:10,063
Otherwise my men would have died,

448
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,564
for nothing.

449
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:14,265
What's wrong with you?

450
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:15,566
I want to help you.

451
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:26,567
I've joined the priesthood.

452
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:28,058
Stop it. It's not the right time.

453
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:29,059
You don't want cash.

454
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,060
You want me to save you.

455
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,061
I'm gonna save your soul.

456
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,662
I'll absolve you of your sins tonight.

457
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:35,863
Blessed are thee among women.

458
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:38,064
Blessed are thy lips,
blessed are thy eyes,

459
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,065
blessed are thy hips...

460
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:43,566
Don't.

461
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,067
and thy gams, and thy chest...

462
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:46,068
Stop it!

463
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:48,069
Stop it!

464
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,070
I gotta...

465
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:51,571
Stop it!

466
00:38:51,572 --> 00:38:52,572
You drunk bastard!

467
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:53,813
This is a house of love not war,

468
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,914
you get out of here.

469
00:38:58,915 --> 00:39:00,115
Who's he really?

470
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,616
An idiot. Don't mind him.

471
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,117
Fine, I'll leave now.

472
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,118
See,

473
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,119
I'm the only man for you.

474
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,119
You're such a fool!

475
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,120
If it wasn't for your foreign face...

476
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:25,121
I like it when you're angry.

477
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:27,056
I wouldn't even look at you!

478
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:28,457
Harder.

479
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,458
I'll never be into you.

480
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:30,459
Come here.

481
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Get off me!

482
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:33,861
I love that!

483
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:34,862
I love seeing you walk away.

484
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:37,563
I love seeing that ass.

485
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:40,064
Mo!

486
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:42,065
Mo!

487
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:45,066
That night!

488
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,067
Major Li didn't go far.

489
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,068
He stayed at the paper
shop across the street.

490
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:52,859
I know,

491
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,560
he could have changed into
civilian clothing and fled.

492
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:57,056
I said you can't go in!

493
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:10,457
Little sister,

494
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,058
we won't shit or piss in there.

495
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:15,059
We just want to wash up.

496
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,060
We always wash before bed-time.

497
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,061
Bed-time?

498
00:40:20,062 --> 00:40:21,062
Morning for you is night for us.

499
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:25,063
Little sister...

500
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:26,564
Don't call me sister!

501
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:27,565
You want to start a fight?

502
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:29,066
The bathroom is for people.

503
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,567
You mean we are not people?

504
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:31,768
You know what you are!

505
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,269
You've got some nerve!

506
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,440
We won't share the bathroom with you!

507
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:36,056
What a temper!

508
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:38,057
Sorry, go back to your rat hole.

509
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:41,058
What the hell?

510
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:42,959
She's humiliating us.

511
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,260
She thinks we are filthy.

512
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:46,061
Little bitch!

513
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:47,062
You're the bitch!

514
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:48,063
Watch your mouth!

515
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:50,064
Ling, want to see a good fight?

516
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:52,065
Really?

517
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,066
I thought you'd only fight for Mo.

518
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,067
Let's pull down your pants

519
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:58,068
and see what you are made of.

520
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:00,068
Don't touch me, you filthy whore!

521
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:02,069
Let's find out if you really
are cleaner than us.

522
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,070
Stop it! It's not fair!

523
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,571
I don't have to hit you,

524
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:09,062
I can just crush you with my butt!

525
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:10,863
I don't give a damn, I'm going in.

526
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:13,564
I won't let you go in!

527
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,055
Stop fighting!

528
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,556
What's going on?

529
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:19,557
Stop!

530
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:20,558
What are you doing?

531
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,159
Are you crazy?

532
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,450
We are just kids!

533
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,711
Hau, that's enough.

534
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:27,712
No. it's not over!

535
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:28,713
I won't let you go in!

536
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:30,414
Japanese!

537
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:39,415
Go to the cellar, I'll tell the others!

538
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,416
Search the yard!

539
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:59,417
Split up!

540
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:12,058
Hurry! Go to the cellar!

541
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,659
Come in, hurry!

542
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,059
Don't shut it, let the girls in.

543
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,260
Let the girls in!

544
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,061
Hurry!

545
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,082
Don't move!

546
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,083
Lieutenant Asakura!

547
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,404
Come over here!

548
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,305
Upstairs!

549
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:31,606
Hurry!

550
00:44:24,054 --> 00:44:25,054
Let's move the shelves!

551
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:27,055
There are girls here!

552
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:32,056
Search everywhere!

553
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:33,557
Capture them alive!

554
00:44:33,858 --> 00:44:35,058
Lieutenant Asakura!

555
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,358
Come up here!

556
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,059
We've got virgins!

557
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,860
Hurry!

558
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:07,061
Stop!

559
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:09,062
Girls! Girls!

560
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:13,063
Stop!

561
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:03,063
Stop!

562
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:06,064
Stop!

563
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:08,065
This is a house of the Lord!

564
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:11,066
These are children!

565
00:47:11,067 --> 00:47:12,567
You are breaking the laws
of man and of God!

566
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:17,052
No soldiers here!

567
00:47:17,053 --> 00:47:18,553
You have no business being here!

568
00:47:18,554 --> 00:47:21,054
I am the priest!

569
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,055
And I command you,

570
00:47:23,056 --> 00:47:24,056
In the name of the Father to leave now!

571
00:47:24,057 --> 00:47:27,057
Girls, you come up here now!

572
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:30,058
Come up these stairs,

573
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:31,059
and stand behind me.

574
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,060
You're honorable men,

575
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:35,061
behave honorably!

576
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,062
I'll eat you up.

577
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:14,062
Stop! Stop this! Stop! Run!

578
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:40,063
- Stop this! Don't...
- Get up!

579
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:43,064
Chinese soldiers!

580
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:16,064
Chinese soldiers! Get them!

581
00:50:16,065 --> 00:50:18,065
Let's go!

582
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:20,066
Assemble outside! Roll call!

583
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,067
Prepare for combat!

584
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,068
The sniper is across the street!

585
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:18,069
To your left!

586
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,070
It's a trap! Find the enemy!

587
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,070
Damn it!

588
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:33,071
He's in the building there!

589
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:35,072
Use the grenades!

590
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,073
Behing us! Fire!

591
00:53:08,074 --> 00:53:10,074
Keep firing!

592
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:12,075
Hold your fire!

593
00:54:00,075 --> 00:54:02,075
Wait!

594
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,076
Fire!

595
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,077
First platoon to the back gate!

596
00:55:59,077 --> 00:56:01,077
Second platoon to the front gate!

597
00:56:01,078 --> 00:56:04,078
Colonel,

598
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,079
he used to work for the
traffic department.

599
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,080
Most roads in Nanking are destroyed.

600
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:15,581
Having him can be useful.

601
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:17,882
Speak Japanese?

602
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:19,047
Yes.

603
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:20,048
Were our soldiers here recently?

604
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:52,049
Are you the resident priest?

605
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,050
Yes.

606
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,551
Father,

607
00:56:58,552 --> 00:56:59,252
I apologize on behalf of our soldiers.

608
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,453
Please understand.

609
00:57:02,054 --> 00:57:03,254
In the middle of a war,

610
00:57:03,255 --> 00:57:05,055
occasional unfortunate
behavior is inevitable.

611
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:08,056
Your church.

612
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:11,057
is very beautiful.

613
00:57:11,058 --> 00:57:13,058
How do you do?

614
00:57:19,558 --> 00:57:21,058
Are you students here at the convent?

615
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:22,059
So sorry to have caused you alarm.

616
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,060
Please...

617
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:26,061
Don't hurt the children anymore.

618
00:57:26,062 --> 00:57:27,562
Naturally.

619
00:57:27,563 --> 00:57:30,046
My name is Hasegawa.

620
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,047
I am responsible for
the safety of this area.

621
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,048
Please do not worry...

622
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:35,049
about the security of the church

623
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,050
and the students.

624
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:43,051
I apologize...

625
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,052
but I have no confidence...
in that assurance.

626
00:57:45,553 --> 00:57:46,053
My guarantee is effective.

627
00:57:46,554 --> 00:57:49,054
From now on,

628
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,555
I shall post armed guards
in front of the church

629
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,046
to protect you all.

630
00:58:01,097 --> 00:58:02,557
There is not a lot of food

631
00:58:03,048 --> 00:58:06,046
in Nanking at the moment.

632
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:16,047
I hope the students will not go hungry.

633
00:59:13,347 --> 00:59:14,347
May I?

634
00:59:16,058 --> 00:59:18,048
Thank you.

635
00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:21,549
Did you like it?

636
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:23,050
This is a Japanese folk song,

637
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:25,051
"My Home."

638
00:59:25,052 --> 00:59:27,052
It is about hills and rabbits,

639
00:59:28,053 --> 00:59:30,053
and streams full fish.

640
00:59:30,054 --> 00:59:32,054
It is the most beautiful
song in the world,

641
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:42,055
for those who are homesick.

642
00:59:45,856 --> 00:59:47,056
Do the students sing well?

643
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:49,057
Very well, yes.

644
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:50,058
That's good.

645
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:51,559
I shall come back

646
00:59:53,045 --> 00:59:54,045
in a couple of days to hear them.

647
00:59:54,046 --> 00:59:55,046
Why?

648
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:58,047
No reason.

649
00:59:59,048 --> 01:00:01,048
I happen to love music.

650
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:47,049
Father, we shall meet again soon.

651
01:01:11,044 --> 01:01:12,044
I hope you will not be
lonely buried together.

652
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,045
Father Jhon.

653
01:01:32,846 --> 01:01:35,046
You won't leave us, will you?

654
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:36,047
We shouldn't have taken over your cellar.

655
01:01:39,848 --> 01:01:41,248
Sorry.

656
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:42,849
If we hadn't fought with that girl,

657
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:44,450
she would still be alive.

658
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:55,051
This is all our fault.

659
01:02:06,052 --> 01:02:08,052
Thank you.

660
01:02:13,053 --> 01:02:15,053
Why not answer Shu?

661
01:02:15,854 --> 01:02:17,054
She called me Father John.

662
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:18,555
We all need you.

663
01:02:19,056 --> 01:02:20,046
I'm a mortician.

664
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:21,047
You are priest.

665
01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:24,048
No.

666
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:26,049
- If we have a priest...
- George.

667
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,250
Maybe Japanese...

668
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,051
not dare...

669
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:30,552
You are priest!

670
01:02:32,053 --> 01:02:33,053
George, I'm not.

671
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:34,054
I'm not a priest.

672
01:02:34,055 --> 01:02:35,055
I'm not!

673
01:02:35,696 --> 01:02:38,256
I stayed here,

674
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,257
because I was looking for your cash.

675
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,397
And because that's
the nicest bed that I've

676
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:45,598
slept in in years. I did't get there.

677
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:47,299
But is that like a priest?
I'm not a priest!

678
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,200
I'm not.

679
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:52,951
I took catechism lessons as a kid.

680
01:02:53,052 --> 01:02:55,952
Sometimes I remember that when I'm drunk,

681
01:03:03,043 --> 01:03:05,043
which I am often as I can be.

682
01:03:06,044 --> 01:03:08,044
You not be priest.

683
01:03:28,045 --> 01:03:30,045
Tell girls yourself.

684
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:33,546
You little shit!

685
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:53,897
You are.

686
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:56,043
We've heard about what happened today.

687
01:04:03,044 --> 01:04:04,044
So you're staying?

688
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:06,545
Yeah.

689
01:04:06,546 --> 01:04:08,846
Even though you were

690
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:10,847
a drunk bastard last night,

691
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:18,248
what you did today makes you a hero.

692
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:21,049
I'm sorry about last night.

693
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:25,750
Yeah.

694
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,151
I can't leave them by themselves.

695
01:04:27,352 --> 01:04:30,152
And that little shit

696
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:34,152
has a way of just... you know.

697
01:04:34,343 --> 01:04:38,043
What do you think the Japanese are up to?

698
01:04:43,044 --> 01:04:44,544
Are they really here to
protect the students?

699
01:04:44,545 --> 01:04:46,045
We were counting on having you

700
01:04:46,046 --> 01:04:48,046
help us leave Nanking.

701
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:50,047
But I guess now you'll have to

702
01:04:51,548 --> 01:04:53,048
stay here and be a priest.

703
01:04:55,049 --> 01:04:56,049
Yeah, right.

704
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,050
Priest.

705
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:03,051
Actuality, I came to tell you,

706
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:05,252
our offer is still good.

707
01:05:05,253 --> 01:05:07,553
We still want you to help us escape.

708
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,854
As soon as the Japanese guards are gone.

709
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:14,042
Just now the ladies were having a bet.

710
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,393
They said that hero or no hero,

711
01:05:15,424 --> 01:05:17,444
you don't stand a chance

712
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:20,042
when you're up against a beauty like me.

713
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:22,043
Don't flatter yourself.

714
01:05:51,044 --> 01:05:52,394
We'll see.

715
01:05:56,195 --> 01:05:57,395
Did you like it?

716
01:05:57,396 --> 01:05:59,596
I only have one string.

717
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,847
It sound like a beggar's plea. Even worse.

718
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:11,248
You're Pu Sheng.

719
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:13,449
Born in the Pu region?

720
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,050
My family is also from there.

721
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:17,051
When you're healthy,

722
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:19,052
I'll take you to the biggest dance hall,

723
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:21,062
to see the prettiest girls.

724
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:23,063
Thank you.

725
01:06:23,064 --> 01:06:24,164
Little home town fellow,

726
01:06:24,165 --> 01:06:25,165
don't thank me,

727
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,166
marry me.

728
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:34,167
I'll work in the fields with you.

729
01:06:35,068 --> 01:06:36,048
I don't have...

730
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:38,349
fields.

731
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,050
What do you have then?

732
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:44,051
I don't have anything.

733
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:46,952
Then I'll play my pipa everday.

734
01:06:46,953 --> 01:06:48,553
When I play, you hold out a bowl.

735
01:06:50,044 --> 01:06:51,354
We'll get for food and feed your mom.

736
01:06:51,555 --> 01:06:54,045
I don't have a mother.

737
01:07:57,896 --> 01:08:00,041
Everyone in my family is dead.

738
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,342
If you had just come with me,

739
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:04,043
this wouldn't have happened.

740
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:06,044
You were so stubborn,

741
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:07,045
and wouldn't leave
without your classmates.

742
01:08:07,046 --> 01:08:08,545
How could I have gotten

743
01:08:09,046 --> 01:08:10,146
that many boat tickets?

744
01:08:10,347 --> 01:08:12,347
Because of you,

745
01:08:18,048 --> 01:08:18,948
I'm staying in Nanking.

746
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,049
Tell me,

747
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,050
what's this?

748
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,551
Explain to me,

749
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:29,042
why do you do this?

750
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:30,043
If I don't do this,

751
01:08:30,794 --> 01:08:31,044
I can't survive.

752
01:08:31,045 --> 01:08:32,045
I'm doing this for you.

753
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:33,346
You must believe me,

754
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,047
I would never do anything bad.

755
01:08:36,048 --> 01:08:37,048
Daughter,

756
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:39,349
I will find a way

757
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,350
to get you out of Nanking.

758
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:53,321
No wonder there were no boat tickets.

759
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,322
Traitor!

760
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:29,323
You work for the Japanese?

761
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,044
Since I cannot save my country,

762
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:32,395
cannot save others,

763
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:34,140
I can only try to save myself.

764
01:09:34,391 --> 01:09:37,141
I'm already doing my best, you know.

765
01:09:37,142 --> 01:09:38,242
Do you think it's easy

766
01:09:38,243 --> 01:09:39,243
working for the Japanese?

767
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:41,144
It's good you work for the Japanese,

768
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:42,045
that helps us.

769
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:43,446
What is your plan for your daughter?

770
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:45,147
I would like to try,

771
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:47,148
and use my connections with the Japanese

772
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,149
to get my daughter out of the city.

773
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,040
Not to the refuge?

774
01:09:52,141 --> 01:09:53,041
The refuge?

775
01:09:53,042 --> 01:09:54,342
It's not safe there at all!

776
01:09:57,142 --> 01:09:59,342
What's your plan for
the rest of the girls?

777
01:10:04,043 --> 01:10:05,043
Mr. Meng?

778
01:10:06,544 --> 01:10:08,044
I have this truck.

779
01:10:08,045 --> 01:10:10,045
If I can get the right tools,

780
01:10:10,446 --> 01:10:12,446
then maybe I can get this started.

781
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:13,547
Can you help me?

782
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:17,548
I have a list here.

783
01:10:17,749 --> 01:10:18,449
Mr. Meng.

784
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,040
I need these tools.

785
01:10:20,441 --> 01:10:21,441
Can you help me get them?

786
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:24,442
You're the only one who
can get them for me.

787
01:10:25,243 --> 01:10:26,543
I need these tools.

788
01:10:31,044 --> 01:10:32,044
I need these tools.

789
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:33,045
Take this.

790
01:10:34,046 --> 01:10:35,046
Take this.

791
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:41,547
If I fix the truck...

792
01:10:42,848 --> 01:10:44,548
If I fix the truck, what then?

793
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:46,549
How would I know?

794
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,040
Wait, wait.

795
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,042
If I fix the truck,

796
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:52,193
what would I need then?

797
01:10:52,324 --> 01:10:54,394
Of course you'll need a permit.

798
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:55,395
I need a permit?

799
01:10:57,096 --> 01:10:58,146
I need a permit.

800
01:10:59,147 --> 01:11:00,397
Don't look at me.

801
01:11:00,948 --> 01:11:02,198
It's too risky!

802
01:11:26,406 --> 01:11:28,396
Even if you fix the truck,

803
01:11:28,428 --> 01:11:30,587
how would you get past
the Japanese guards?

804
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:32,367
I don't know.

805
01:11:35,173 --> 01:11:37,040
I don't know how long,

806
01:11:37,101 --> 01:11:38,872
the guards will stay here.

807
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,740
But I want to get that truck started

808
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:43,820
for when they leave.

809
01:11:43,965 --> 01:11:46,779
It seems that you know
more than just drinking.

810
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:58,629
I don't think she life
seeing us together.

811
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,039
She has a crush on you.

812
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:01,084
Really?

813
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:05,991
You know, I was like her.

814
01:12:07,747 --> 01:12:08,747
Yeah?

815
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:13,739
I was at a convent for six years.

816
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,066
That's where you learned your English?

817
01:12:26,814 --> 01:12:28,114
What happened?

818
01:12:28,942 --> 01:12:31,842
Just another story of misfortune.

819
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:35,094
It wouldn't interest
a passer-by like yourself.

820
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,190
Yeah, it would.

821
01:12:37,373 --> 01:12:38,373
Tell me.

822
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,131
Tell me.

823
01:12:46,693 --> 01:12:49,393
I was never meant to be like this.

824
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:54,489
Never mind.

825
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:57,009
You know what?

826
01:12:57,442 --> 01:13:00,442
I was the best in my English class,

827
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,946
but everyone used to mock me.

828
01:13:02,996 --> 01:13:05,246
They said I put on airs and graces

829
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:09,842
and acted like I was the Queen of England.

830
01:13:12,106 --> 01:13:14,946
Well, that's not what you are
going to tell me, but...

831
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,557
So... the Queen of England.

832
01:13:17,628 --> 01:13:19,248
You mean you're not?

833
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:21,739
I thought... yeah.

834
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:26,061
Like Shu, I too had a cruch on someone.

835
01:13:26,267 --> 01:13:30,647
But he was a young, fresh-face guy,

836
01:13:30,835 --> 01:13:33,734
got the most beautiful eyes,

837
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,640
not a dirty, bearded man like you.

838
01:13:42,404 --> 01:13:43,404
OK.

839
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:39,137
It's rotten.

840
01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:42,858
Sister.

841
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:43,979
Sister.

842
01:14:46,144 --> 01:14:47,144
What are you saying?

843
01:14:48,143 --> 01:14:49,143
Sister...

844
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:50,632
Hurry...

845
01:14:51,772 --> 01:14:52,772
Pu Sheng,

846
01:14:52,847 --> 01:14:53,997
I'm here.

847
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:56,671
Thunder...

848
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:58,735
What are you trying to say?

849
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,132
Rain...

850
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:03,133
Rain...

851
01:15:06,038 --> 01:15:07,544
What rain?

852
01:15:08,145 --> 01:15:10,145
It's death weeping for you.

853
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:15,638
The wheat is drying outside...

854
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:21,372
Don't let it get soaked.

855
01:16:16,695 --> 01:16:18,795
That was the soldier
that the officer brought.

856
01:16:19,025 --> 01:16:20,745
I heard he was about our age.

857
01:16:20,904 --> 01:16:22,244
Which officer?

858
01:16:22,317 --> 01:16:24,287
The officer who saved us that day.

859
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:28,245
He hid the soldier inside the cellar,

860
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:30,707
and the women were taking care of him.

861
01:16:30,739 --> 01:16:33,719
Actually those women from the brothel...

862
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:34,951
are not that bad.

863
01:16:36,745 --> 01:16:37,915
Where's Dou?

864
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:41,683
Lan's missing too.

865
01:16:42,175 --> 01:16:43,175
Really?

866
01:16:43,442 --> 01:16:45,642
Haven't seen them for a while.

867
01:16:45,737 --> 01:16:47,087
Are they still in the cellar?

868
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:48,979
Have you seen Dou?

869
01:16:55,926 --> 01:16:57,826
Dou and Lan got out.

870
01:16:59,137 --> 01:16:59,987
How?

871
01:17:00,092 --> 01:17:01,132
Where did they go?

872
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:03,888
Dou insisted on getting pipa strings.

873
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:06,183
She wanted to play the pipa for Pu Sheng.

874
01:17:06,339 --> 01:17:07,789
She said he had a hard life,

875
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:09,638
and he was like her brother.

876
01:17:09,781 --> 01:17:12,040
She wanted to play something nice for him,

877
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:14,143
but one string wasn't enough,

878
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,643
she needed three more.

879
01:17:15,837 --> 01:17:16,937
What about Lan?

880
01:17:17,086 --> 01:17:17,939
Why did she go?

881
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:21,067
She said she left her earrings behind.

882
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:22,639
How could they leave?

883
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,110
The Japanese are guarding the gates.

884
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:26,830
I don't know how they got out.

885
01:17:27,136 --> 01:17:29,436
They disappeared when it was dark.

886
01:17:29,638 --> 01:17:30,638
Dou said that

887
01:17:31,006 --> 01:17:32,006
if she didn't go soon

888
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:33,439
it would be too late for him.

889
01:17:33,636 --> 01:17:34,894
Why did't you stop them!

890
01:17:35,036 --> 01:17:37,276
I tried, but it didn't work!

891
01:17:43,436 --> 01:17:44,436
What happened?

892
01:17:44,636 --> 01:17:47,036
Dou and Lan snuck out on their own.

893
01:17:47,644 --> 01:17:48,894
Dou and Lan?

894
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,457
How? How did they leave?

895
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:52,804
I don't know.

896
01:17:52,932 --> 01:17:53,742
You know when?

897
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:54,639
No.

898
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:56,636
Where did they go?

899
01:17:56,786 --> 01:17:59,565
They went back to our
brothel to get pipa strings.

900
01:18:10,236 --> 01:18:10,036
You want me to... go find them?

901
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,449
Yeah.

902
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,551
Mo, I'm not sure...

903
01:18:16,845 --> 01:18:17,845
Please.

904
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,709
Please. Please!

905
01:18:30,642 --> 01:18:31,636
Alright, it's safer for me

906
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:33,639
that anyone else, so I'll try.

907
01:18:33,903 --> 01:18:34,903
I'll try.

908
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,040
If I can leave. If they let me leave.

909
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:41,170
Candles, food.

910
01:18:42,136 --> 01:18:43,320
There is no food.

911
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,142
They need food.

912
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,390
With no food.

913
01:18:47,592 --> 01:18:48,592
No singing.

914
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:51,677
Hasegawa asks girls to sing.

915
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:54,683
Singing for the girls.
915n

916
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:57,058
Hasegawa asks.

917
01:18:58,643 --> 01:19:01,412
But no singing with no food.

918
01:19:01,944 --> 01:19:03,535
And candles for Hasegawa.

919
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:04,715
I go get food.

920
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,285
Girls sing. Hasegawa happy. Yes?

921
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,140
I go now.

922
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:10,363
George, you're not coming.

923
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,840
I go, for food?

924
01:19:13,244 --> 01:19:13,644
Yes?

925
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:14,757
George, you're not coming.

926
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:16,381
Go back inside!

927
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,640
Yes?

928
01:19:17,873 --> 01:19:19,043
Make Hasegawa happy.

929
01:19:19,644 --> 01:19:20,144
Go.

930
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,985
This is fine, I go. Thank you.

931
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:27,935
Officer, is he allowed to leave?

932
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,640
We've been told not to let girls leave.

933
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:31,650
But he's the priest.

934
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:00,833
Terry?

935
01:20:03,192 --> 01:20:04,042
Terry.

936
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:05,354
John?

937
01:20:06,153 --> 01:20:07,093
I tried getting back,

938
01:20:07,185 --> 01:20:08,245
I tried getting back to the refuge.

939
01:20:08,492 --> 01:20:09,142
I got struck.

940
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:10,267
I couldn't get back.

941
01:20:10,337 --> 01:20:11,937
I was trying to get back. I'm sorry.

942
01:20:12,037 --> 01:20:13,937
I thought you were...
I figured you were dead.

943
01:20:14,237 --> 01:20:15,237
I'm looking for two women,

944
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:16,639
the got shiny dresses.

945
01:20:16,714 --> 01:20:18,544
I need to find them. They are in trouble.

946
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:20,542
Why are you dressed like this?
What is this?

947
01:20:20,617 --> 01:20:22,337
I got drunk, I woke up, I was just...

948
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:23,757
dressed as priest.

949
01:20:25,789 --> 01:20:26,639
Who is this?

950
01:20:26,737 --> 01:20:27,987
This is George. This is George.

951
01:20:28,144 --> 01:20:29,144
Have you seen them?

952
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:29,889
Seen who?

953
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,540
The women!

954
01:20:30,602 --> 01:20:32,742
There're women piled
up all over the street.

955
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:34,088
You haven't seen them?

956
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:35,757
No, I haven't seen any women. No.

957
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:37,885
You think it's safe looking
at the women right now?

958
01:20:37,983 --> 01:20:38,983
Can you help me with tools?

959
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:39,988
Tools for what?

960
01:20:40,039 --> 01:20:41,069
I gotta fix a truck.

961
01:20:41,222 --> 01:20:42,222
Fix a truck for what?

962
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:43,350
I gotta help George,

963
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,622
I gotta help some girls,

964
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:46,710
I gotta help some women,
they're prostitutes,

965
01:20:46,731 --> 01:20:47,441
and I gotta help them.

966
01:20:47,544 --> 01:20:48,434
What? Are you kidding me?

967
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:50,139
You're talking about
prostitutes and truck,

968
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:50,984
and tools.

969
01:20:51,035 --> 01:20:52,635
I'm talking about not dying in China.

970
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,816
I'm leaving right now!

971
01:20:54,442 --> 01:20:55,562
You're leaving Nanking right now?

972
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:56,955
Do you wanna go?

973
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,085
There's a boat. It's waiting for us.

974
01:20:59,223 --> 01:21:00,853
I'm leaving right now.

975
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:02,185
If you wanna go, then let's go!

976
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:04,597
It's your last chance.

977
01:21:10,134 --> 01:21:11,058
I gotta find them.

978
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:12,091
I can't leave.

979
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:13,578
Are you kidding me right now?

980
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:14,935
I'll see you, Terry!

981
01:21:15,992 --> 01:21:16,992
I'll see ya.

982
01:22:18,342 --> 01:22:19,642
Take off your coat!

983
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:21,617
Hurry!

984
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:30,513
They went that way.

985
01:22:32,088 --> 01:22:33,488
Those are their coats.

986
01:22:33,634 --> 01:22:36,433
Look! Those are young girls' coats!

987
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:39,480
The girls can't be far.

988
01:22:46,182 --> 01:22:48,042
Oh no, I dropped the strings!

989
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:49,840
Forget it.

990
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:51,639
No, I have to find them.

991
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:43,133
Over there!

992
01:23:43,338 --> 01:23:44,338
Don't shoot!

993
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,250
Lan!

994
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:48,656
Lan!

995
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:51,620
Don't run!

996
01:23:56,646 --> 01:23:58,646
Bitch!

997
01:23:59,103 --> 01:24:00,103
Go to hell!

998
01:24:00,224 --> 01:24:01,434
We'll deal with her later.

999
01:24:01,633 --> 01:24:02,633
Let's catch the other one.

1000
01:24:02,703 --> 01:24:03,703
Let's go!

1001
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:15,483
Here she is!

1002
01:24:33,786 --> 01:24:34,786
Why am I always the last one?

1003
01:24:35,881 --> 01:24:37,641
You shouldn't have shot the other girl.

1004
01:24:37,704 --> 01:24:38,434
It's not fair!

1005
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:39,541
Hurry!

1006
01:24:47,984 --> 01:24:48,984
Fuck you!

1007
01:24:49,445 --> 01:24:50,625
Fuck you all!

1008
01:24:56,882 --> 01:24:59,741
Bitch! You bit me!

1009
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,632
I'll kill you!

1010
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:06,434
What an idiot! You got bitten!

1011
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:08,689
You can only handle
the dead one upstairs!

1012
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:15,795
Is it? George, yes?

1013
01:26:16,418 --> 01:26:17,418
Is it?

1014
01:26:19,839 --> 01:26:20,939
Is it?

1015
01:26:21,488 --> 01:26:22,338
Yes?

1016
01:26:33,227 --> 01:26:35,637
Stay there, stay there.

1017
01:27:07,515 --> 01:27:09,015
They were on their way back.

1018
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:17,638
It was a stray bullet or... maybe...

1019
01:27:17,651 --> 01:27:18,771
I don't know.

1020
01:27:22,799 --> 01:27:24,299
I don't think they suffered.

1021
01:27:25,631 --> 01:27:26,958
I don't think so.

1022
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:29,721
Is that true?

1023
01:27:31,839 --> 01:27:33,029
Yes.

1024
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,075
He said,

1025
01:27:38,757 --> 01:27:41,697
Dou and Lan were hit by stray bullets

1026
01:27:42,783 --> 01:27:44,253
that they didn't suffer.

1027
01:27:58,189 --> 01:27:59,059
Come in.

1028
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:01,476
George.

1029
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,280
Come in. George.

1030
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:06,138
It's me.

1031
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:10,488
I only have two minutes.

1032
01:28:11,936 --> 01:28:13,636
The guards finely let me in.

1033
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:15,480
These tools

1034
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:16,610
you need.

1035
01:28:19,631 --> 01:28:20,811
Thank you.

1036
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,470
Now, listen to me.

1037
01:28:22,623 --> 01:28:25,623
- This permit was for my daughter.
- Right.

1038
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,830
But I can't carry out my plan.

1039
01:28:29,089 --> 01:28:31,139
You are my only hope now.

1040
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:33,630
The Japanese don't trust me anymore.

1041
01:28:33,784 --> 01:28:35,014
You are a Westerner.

1042
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,110
You can help her.

1043
01:28:37,357 --> 01:28:40,037
My daughter wouldn't leave
without her classmates.

1044
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,886
Please think of a way to
get her out of Nanking.

1045
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:45,820
The permit is only good for short time.

1046
01:28:46,213 --> 01:28:47,933
When you manage to leave the church,

1047
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,133
remember, head west.

1048
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:52,642
There's a way out of city there.

1049
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:54,633
I have to go.

1050
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:56,063
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

1051
01:28:56,162 --> 01:28:57,162
Mr. Meng, thank you.

1052
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:57,686
Mr. Meng,

1053
01:28:57,762 --> 01:28:58,732
with your connections...

1054
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,630
is there anything else
you can do for us...?

1055
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:01,924
No, no, sorry.

1056
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:03,201
John,

1057
01:29:03,632 --> 01:29:05,632
I'm handing my daughter over to you.

1058
01:29:07,036 --> 01:29:09,066
I have promised her mother,

1059
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,015
I'll take good care of her.

1060
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,245
OK.

1061
01:29:12,637 --> 01:29:13,717
Please.

1062
01:29:15,634 --> 01:29:16,894
OK. Mr. Meng,

1063
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:17,930
thank you.

1064
01:29:18,145 --> 01:29:19,145
Thank you for this.

1065
01:29:19,231 --> 01:29:20,631
You are a good man.

1066
01:29:22,085 --> 01:29:23,785
In the eyes of my daughter,

1067
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,520
I'm a bad man,

1068
01:29:26,037 --> 01:29:27,227
a traitor.

1069
01:29:27,336 --> 01:29:28,456
No.

1070
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:30,111
Thank you.

1071
01:30:33,629 --> 01:30:35,648
Damn Mosquito, her cat ran off.

1072
01:30:35,654 --> 01:30:36,954
She went up to look for it.

1073
01:31:05,783 --> 01:31:06,713
Good.

1074
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:08,651
You sing very well.

1075
01:31:24,066 --> 01:31:25,066
Haven't I told you?

1076
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:26,630
You can't come out!

1077
01:31:27,737 --> 01:31:28,827
Officer,

1078
01:31:29,328 --> 01:31:31,988
this student has lost her uniform.

1079
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:35,629
Because we wanted to look our best today,

1080
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:40,131
we asked her not to
participate in the performance.

1081
01:31:40,988 --> 01:31:42,728
Please forgive the intrusion.

1082
01:31:55,395 --> 01:31:56,395
Father,

1083
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,537
I would like to announce some good news.

1084
01:31:59,636 --> 01:32:01,636
Tomorrow our division is celebrating

1085
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:03,979
the successful occupation of Nanking.

1086
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:05,522
Esteemed Father,

1087
01:32:05,996 --> 01:32:07,636
on behalf of all the officers,

1088
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:09,841
I would like to invite your church choir

1089
01:32:09,929 --> 01:32:12,129
to perform and celebrate with us.

1090
01:32:22,244 --> 01:32:24,834
This is the official invitation.

1091
01:32:29,232 --> 01:32:31,632
They are asking us to
sing at a party tomorrow.

1092
01:32:35,482 --> 01:32:36,862
This is a very kind invitation,

1093
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:38,684
Mr. Hasegawa.

1094
01:32:39,206 --> 01:32:40,606
However, unfortunately,

1095
01:32:40,633 --> 01:32:42,733
the children will not be able to attend.

1096
01:32:42,884 --> 01:32:43,734
Why not?

1097
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,628
Sir, they're very young.

1098
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:47,781
I'm not sure that it is appropriate

1099
01:32:47,978 --> 01:32:49,978
for them to attend an adults' party.

1100
01:32:50,078 --> 01:32:51,928
As their guardian and protector,

1101
01:32:52,034 --> 01:32:53,634
that is my responsibility.

1102
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:55,164
But we thank you very much.

1103
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:58,650
I am sorry.

1104
01:32:58,728 --> 01:33:00,628
This is an order from above.

1105
01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:01,974
I cannot disobey.

1106
01:33:07,282 --> 01:33:08,192
Sir.

1107
01:33:08,403 --> 01:33:09,983
Please think about the girls.

1108
01:33:10,032 --> 01:33:12,332
I can see that you are man of culture.

1109
01:33:12,394 --> 01:33:14,634
Last time you played us a beautiful song,

1110
01:33:14,647 --> 01:33:16,142
for people far from home.

1111
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:19,630
You missed rivers and hills.

1112
01:33:19,935 --> 01:33:22,935
Please consider that theirs
have been destroyed,

1113
01:33:23,035 --> 01:33:25,245
they have no home, nothing.

1114
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:27,470
They are living in hell.

1115
01:33:27,577 --> 01:33:28,627
With this invitation,

1116
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,936
you are asking them to celebrate that.

1117
01:33:31,033 --> 01:33:32,933
I know that you understand.

1118
01:33:33,029 --> 01:33:34,399
With respect, sir,

1119
01:33:34,433 --> 01:33:37,043
I cannot allow that. I think that is...

1120
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,200
I think that is brutal, sir.

1121
01:33:43,873 --> 01:33:45,633
Please remember,

1122
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,631
tomorrow at four in the afternoon,

1123
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:49,629
a car will come pick up the students.

1124
01:33:49,761 --> 01:33:52,031
I am carrying out military orders.

1125
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:53,529
Mr. Hasegawa,

1126
01:33:54,636 --> 01:33:57,686
you tell me what will happen
at these celebrations.

1127
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:04,294
Mr. Hasegawa.

1128
01:34:07,233 --> 01:34:10,163
You said you posted
guards for our security.

1129
01:34:10,339 --> 01:34:11,629
Have you been keeping these girls

1130
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:13,752
liked up until these celebrations?

1131
01:34:17,982 --> 01:34:20,252
The children cannot go.

1132
01:34:22,329 --> 01:34:23,519
Mr. Hasegawa.

1133
01:34:24,354 --> 01:34:25,354
Mr. Hasegawa!

1134
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:28,153
The children cannot go!

1135
01:34:29,685 --> 01:34:31,265
The children cannot go!

1136
01:34:46,937 --> 01:34:47,937
One, two, three, four,

1137
01:34:49,033 --> 01:34:51,633
five, six, seven, eight,

1138
01:34:51,756 --> 01:34:53,636
nine, ten, eleven,

1139
01:34:53,732 --> 01:34:55,852
twelve, thirteen.

1140
01:34:57,136 --> 01:34:58,356
All,

1141
01:34:59,228 --> 01:35:00,388
must go!

1142
01:35:22,528 --> 01:35:23,598
Father John,

1143
01:35:25,326 --> 01:35:27,726
what do the Japanese want us to do?

1144
01:35:28,026 --> 01:35:30,126
Do they want us to sing?

1145
01:35:30,632 --> 01:35:31,772
Yeah.

1146
01:35:33,626 --> 01:35:35,003
I'm not a student.

1147
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:37,629
I don't have to go.

1148
01:35:41,626 --> 01:35:43,026
Well, I'm not a student.

1149
01:35:43,684 --> 01:35:44,634
I won't go.

1150
01:35:44,755 --> 01:35:45,755
You have to!

1151
01:35:45,852 --> 01:35:46,852
The Japanese have counted you!

1152
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:48,330
I don't care, I won't go!

1153
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:49,462
You have to go!

1154
01:35:49,617 --> 01:35:51,617
Now you're saying you aren't a student.

1155
01:35:51,638 --> 01:35:53,438
Why didn't you tell the Japanese earlier?

1156
01:35:57,629 --> 01:36:00,629
Stop staring at me!

1157
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:03,225
Save you attitude for the Japanese!

1158
01:36:03,934 --> 01:36:05,234
Do you think the Japanese

1159
01:36:05,276 --> 01:36:06,352
really invited you to sing?

1160
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:08,116
Dream on!

1161
01:36:08,281 --> 01:36:10,431
What do they do all day in Nanking?

1162
01:36:10,727 --> 01:36:12,627
They murder, burn,

1163
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:13,749
and rape!

1164
01:36:13,831 --> 01:36:14,631
You know?

1165
01:36:14,732 --> 01:36:15,972
Go ahead and go,

1166
01:36:16,033 --> 01:36:17,433
but I won't go!

1167
01:36:17,626 --> 01:36:18,933
Mosquito, you shut up!

1168
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:23,733
You are all mean to me!

1169
01:36:23,834 --> 01:36:25,634
I'm not going!

1170
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:46,628
That's not true what she said.

1171
01:36:47,029 --> 01:36:50,029
These men are different from the others.

1172
01:36:50,953 --> 01:36:52,833
These men are educated.

1173
01:36:52,929 --> 01:36:54,629
They are officers.

1174
01:36:54,884 --> 01:36:56,534
These men are gentlemen.

1175
01:36:58,037 --> 01:37:01,837
I've been to things like
these before, and...

1176
01:37:02,527 --> 01:37:03,527
it's nice.

1177
01:37:03,626 --> 01:37:05,643
it's elegant, it's a...

1178
01:37:06,032 --> 01:37:07,382
It's a party.

1179
01:37:08,028 --> 01:37:09,318
There's nice things at parties.

1180
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:10,493
There's cakes and there's flowers

1181
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,980
and there's chocolates
and there's dancing...

1182
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:15,634
and there's... all of these
things, with are lovely.

1183
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:19,832
Please don't think about what she said.

1184
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:24,820
I'm a terrible dancer,

1185
01:37:25,825 --> 01:37:26,825
and maybe one day one of you

1186
01:37:26,845 --> 01:37:29,827
could teach me how to dance.
That would be nice.

1187
01:37:33,326 --> 01:37:34,826
Please don't think about that.

1188
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:37,471
Because that's not true.

1189
01:38:02,327 --> 01:38:03,277
Yo...

1190
01:38:05,624 --> 01:38:06,824
lied to you as well.

1191
01:38:07,732 --> 01:38:10,672
Your two friends who
went for the pipa strings,

1192
01:38:11,175 --> 01:38:12,395
they weren't shot.

1193
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:15,533
I'm sorry.

1194
01:38:15,927 --> 01:38:17,457
I think you already knew.

1195
01:38:18,928 --> 01:38:20,108
Yes.

1196
01:38:23,867 --> 01:38:25,107
Sometimes,

1197
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:27,910
the truth is the last
thing we need to hear.

1198
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,710
I heard what you said to the girls.

1199
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,042
What are you gonna do?

1200
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:48,229
I gotta get the truck started.

1201
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:50,581
And after that?

1202
01:38:54,624 --> 01:38:55,919
I have an idea.

1203
01:38:57,226 --> 01:38:59,536
Maybe I can save one of them,

1204
01:38:59,575 --> 01:39:01,075
with your help.

1205
01:39:01,744 --> 01:39:02,744
How?

1206
01:39:02,975 --> 01:39:04,255
The Japanese thought

1207
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:06,028
Mosquito was one of the girls.

1208
01:39:06,632 --> 01:39:07,752
She tricked them.

1209
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:09,463
Why can't I?

1210
01:39:12,731 --> 01:39:13,631
No.

1211
01:39:13,957 --> 01:39:15,427
If you're saying what
I think you're saying,

1212
01:39:15,526 --> 01:39:16,606
no.

1213
01:39:18,271 --> 01:39:20,171
That's not happening.

1214
01:39:21,626 --> 01:39:22,976
Remember? Like them,

1215
01:39:22,992 --> 01:39:25,332
I was at a convent for six years.

1216
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:29,720
But unlike them,

1217
01:39:30,433 --> 01:39:32,933
I was raped by my stepfather

1218
01:39:32,944 --> 01:39:35,441
when I was thirteen years old.

1219
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:41,040
By their age,

1220
01:39:42,224 --> 01:39:46,024
I was already forced to
take my first clients.

1221
01:39:50,175 --> 01:39:52,625
I don't want them to go through that.

1222
01:39:55,474 --> 01:39:57,430
But I can't let you do that, Mo.

1223
01:40:00,626 --> 01:40:02,326
I can't let you do that.

1224
01:40:13,225 --> 01:40:14,525
What are you doing?

1225
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:16,055
Get back in.

1226
01:40:16,829 --> 01:40:18,179
You can't leave.

1227
01:40:18,628 --> 01:40:19,648
Get back in!

1228
01:40:19,732 --> 01:40:20,952
Get in there!

1229
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:23,032
What are you doing?

1230
01:40:23,977 --> 01:40:25,167
Go back!

1231
01:40:26,632 --> 01:40:27,992
I said go back in!

1232
01:41:00,275 --> 01:41:01,325
I will be the first.

1233
01:41:01,959 --> 01:41:04,359
Remember who's in front of you.

1234
01:41:04,573 --> 01:41:05,843
When we go.

1235
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,275
we will stick to this order.

1236
01:41:07,429 --> 01:41:10,579
Shu, isn't there a better solution?

1237
01:41:11,327 --> 01:41:12,587
No.

1238
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:14,330
We won't let the Japanese

1239
01:41:14,423 --> 01:41:16,393
hurt us again.

1240
01:41:46,727 --> 01:41:47,727
Girls.

1241
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:48,830
Shu!

1242
01:41:49,224 --> 01:41:50,494
Wait, just...

1243
01:41:51,031 --> 01:41:51,831
Go away!

1244
01:41:51,843 --> 01:41:52,623
Come down!

1245
01:41:52,725 --> 01:41:53,845
OK, OK.

1246
01:41:54,031 --> 01:41:55,831
Stay back, OK.

1247
01:41:55,928 --> 01:41:57,028
Don't do anything foolish!

1248
01:41:57,048 --> 01:41:58,378
So many people have died.

1249
01:41:58,425 --> 01:41:59,875
Even hell is packed.

1250
01:41:59,926 --> 01:42:01,526
Why should you add to the crowd?

1251
01:42:04,675 --> 01:42:06,675
Shu, don't do this.

1252
01:42:07,173 --> 01:42:08,476
You can't do this!

1253
01:42:08,528 --> 01:42:10,628
We can't just throw our lives away.

1254
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:13,339
Life is a sacred gift.

1255
01:42:13,425 --> 01:42:15,535
It's not ours to throw away.

1256
01:42:17,029 --> 01:42:19,023
Keep away! Step back!

1257
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:20,580
OK.

1258
01:42:20,631 --> 01:42:23,331
We're stepping back.

1259
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,064
Come up!

1260
01:42:26,127 --> 01:42:28,157
Didn't we say we are
going to jump together?

1261
01:42:29,082 --> 01:42:30,381
Up here!

1262
01:42:31,328 --> 01:42:32,558
Come up now!

1263
01:42:33,177 --> 01:42:35,437
Listen to me, Shu, I have an idea.

1264
01:42:35,572 --> 01:42:36,860
I will go in your place.

1265
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:41,027
Tell the girls to get down.

1266
01:42:41,037 --> 01:42:42,027
Tomorrow I will go for you.

1267
01:42:42,127 --> 01:42:44,387
Did you hear me? I will go in your place!

1268
01:42:45,022 --> 01:42:47,081
What? who is going in who's place?

1269
01:42:52,022 --> 01:42:53,422
I will also go for you.

1270
01:42:53,472 --> 01:42:54,539
Right, we will all go instead of you.

1271
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:55,323
We can handle the Japs.

1272
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:56,430
We will protect you.

1273
01:42:56,519 --> 01:42:57,229
We will replace you!

1274
01:42:57,237 --> 01:42:59,343
Don't worry, you have us to protect you.

1275
01:42:59,425 --> 01:43:01,325
Yes, we won't let the Japanese hurt you.

1276
01:43:01,372 --> 01:43:02,374
Do you hears us?

1277
01:43:02,386 --> 01:43:03,566
We will go in your place.

1278
01:43:03,628 --> 01:43:05,528
Come down and don't jump.

1279
01:43:05,623 --> 01:43:06,983
Come down.

1280
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:09,550
We're telling them the
idea I told you about.

1281
01:43:12,023 --> 01:43:14,923
It's a good idea. That's it, girls.

1282
01:43:15,025 --> 01:43:16,035
Shu, come here,

1283
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:17,825
it's a good idea.

1284
01:43:18,003 --> 01:43:20,023
We can trick the Japanese.

1285
01:43:20,035 --> 01:43:21,785
Alright? We'll make it fun.

1286
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:23,628
Come down, we think about it.

1287
01:43:23,726 --> 01:43:26,026
We just come down, and think about it.

1288
01:43:26,729 --> 01:43:28,249
We can make it work.

1289
01:43:36,231 --> 01:43:38,031
We only said it so they would

1290
01:43:38,048 --> 01:43:39,268
get down from the tower.

1291
01:43:42,428 --> 01:43:44,748
But you shouldn't have lied to them.

1292
01:43:44,878 --> 01:43:46,228
Hua, remember?

1293
01:43:46,248 --> 01:43:47,328
If you weren't lied to,

1294
01:43:47,372 --> 01:43:49,053
you wouldn't have ended up in a brothel.

1295
01:43:49,424 --> 01:43:51,324
Shut up! Mosquito.

1296
01:43:51,361 --> 01:43:52,561
I'm not stupid.

1297
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:54,130
If nobody goes you'll still have to go.

1298
01:43:54,142 --> 01:43:56,062
You were counted by the Japanese!

1299
01:43:59,464 --> 01:44:01,524
Unless the Japanese are insane,

1300
01:44:01,572 --> 01:44:03,725
I don't think they will kill us.

1301
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,730
They just want pleasure.

1302
01:44:05,761 --> 01:44:07,831
That's what we do.

1303
01:44:07,971 --> 01:44:09,571
We have experienced all kinds of men.

1304
01:44:09,731 --> 01:44:11,394
As long as we can get out alive,

1305
01:44:11,428 --> 01:44:13,598
we will find a way to survive.

1306
01:44:14,228 --> 01:44:15,178
Ling,

1307
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:16,531
how do you expect the girls

1308
01:44:16,531 --> 01:44:18,031
to handle the Japanese?

1309
01:44:19,228 --> 01:44:21,628
Even if they make it back alive,

1310
01:44:21,698 --> 01:44:23,321
they won't be able to carry on.

1311
01:44:24,826 --> 01:44:26,516
I just don't think it's worth it.

1312
01:44:27,367 --> 01:44:29,367
They wouldn't even let
us use the bathroom,

1313
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:30,676
yet, we're supposed to kiss their asses,

1314
01:44:30,702 --> 01:44:32,072
and sacrifice ourselves for them?

1315
01:44:32,128 --> 01:44:34,728
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

1316
01:44:34,837 --> 01:44:37,337
If Shu hadn't diverted
the Japs the other day,

1317
01:44:37,557 --> 01:44:40,027
where would we all be right now?

1318
01:44:44,107 --> 01:44:47,107
Remember how the ancient
poem describes us?

1319
01:44:49,196 --> 01:44:50,326
"Prostitutes never care
about a falling nation,"

1320
01:44:50,372 --> 01:44:52,322
"they sing and dance
while other are dying."

1321
01:44:52,463 --> 01:44:54,373
You are not so foolish after all.

1322
01:44:54,426 --> 01:44:55,756
I'm impressed.

1323
01:44:56,021 --> 01:44:57,831
Mo just taught me those two lines.

1324
01:44:58,208 --> 01:44:59,428
Of course we should remember

1325
01:44:59,471 --> 01:45:00,925
the poem that criticizes us.

1326
01:45:01,022 --> 01:45:02,322
But, I think,

1327
01:45:02,403 --> 01:45:05,003
we should do something heroic,

1328
01:45:05,026 --> 01:45:07,246
and chance the old way of thinking.

1329
01:45:14,377 --> 01:45:15,247
Mo,

1330
01:45:15,484 --> 01:45:19,424
other say I always follow your lead,

1331
01:45:19,627 --> 01:45:21,627
I say, we share the same life.

1332
01:45:21,722 --> 01:45:23,012
Whatever you say,

1333
01:45:23,129 --> 01:45:24,279
I will go with you.

1334
01:45:24,828 --> 01:45:26,128
I will go too.

1335
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:28,619
Me too.

1336
01:45:30,029 --> 01:45:31,149
Count me in.

1337
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,470
Mo,

1338
01:45:35,628 --> 01:45:38,628
we worked together for three years,

1339
01:45:38,922 --> 01:45:41,382
and you were always more popular than me.

1340
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,180
I know,

1341
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,330
you always looked down on me,

1342
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:47,030
and I never respected you either.

1343
01:45:48,024 --> 01:45:49,224
Well,

1344
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:51,129
today I hear you.

1345
01:45:51,321 --> 01:45:52,491
I say

1346
01:45:52,627 --> 01:45:53,947
we all go,

1347
01:45:54,038 --> 01:45:55,538
so we can look after, each other.

1348
01:45:55,629 --> 01:45:56,939
Mo, you are right.

1349
01:45:57,129 --> 01:45:58,339
People say

1350
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:00,015
"whores are heartless."

1351
01:46:01,024 --> 01:46:02,024
So tomorrow,

1352
01:46:02,072 --> 01:46:03,722
Let's do something
honorable with our hearts.

1353
01:46:05,772 --> 01:46:06,682
We will all go.

1354
01:46:13,725 --> 01:46:13,725
If they went,

1355
01:46:13,822 --> 01:46:17,052
how would the Japanese treat them?

1356
01:46:19,571 --> 01:46:22,571
Will they tear their clothes?

1357
01:46:24,622 --> 01:46:26,322
Will they beat them?

1358
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:32,020
What if the Japanese rape them?

1359
01:46:32,226 --> 01:46:33,816
Are you kidding?

1360
01:46:33,922 --> 01:46:34,722
No.

1361
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:37,020
Have you seen these women?

1362
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:39,879
Those Japanese don't stand a chance.

1363
01:46:41,129 --> 01:46:44,499
These women... these women are formidable.

1364
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:47,325
Brave, exquisite,

1365
01:46:47,479 --> 01:46:48,759
skillful.

1366
01:46:49,172 --> 01:46:50,342
They've got character,

1367
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:52,470
like nobody I've ever met.

1368
01:46:52,922 --> 01:46:54,312
The Japanese?

1369
01:46:55,014 --> 01:46:57,324
They're amateurs, amateurs.

1370
01:46:57,426 --> 01:46:59,526
These women,

1371
01:46:59,627 --> 01:47:01,527
they are professionals.

1372
01:47:02,425 --> 01:47:03,915
Father John,

1373
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:06,821
what exactly do they do?

1374
01:47:12,026 --> 01:47:13,146
You know... they...

1375
01:47:13,429 --> 01:47:16,129
They love and they hate,
just like all of us.

1376
01:47:16,171 --> 01:47:20,051
Maybe they know more
about it than any of us.

1377
01:47:20,379 --> 01:47:22,279
These women if they came

1378
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:24,573
face to face with the devil himself,

1379
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,987
he'd be putty in their hands.

1380
01:47:27,028 --> 01:47:29,348
These idiots? These soldiers?

1381
01:47:30,724 --> 01:47:32,204
You think they're scary?

1382
01:47:32,274 --> 01:47:33,924
They're not scary.

1383
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:35,590
If you think somebody's scary,

1384
01:47:35,629 --> 01:47:37,029
you picture them with their pants around

1385
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:39,629
their ankles, sitting on
the craper, alright?

1386
01:47:39,723 --> 01:47:40,953
Picture that.

1387
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,502
Not so scary then.

1388
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:46,669
These women, and you girls,

1389
01:47:47,077 --> 01:47:51,897
you gotta strength and
beauty that will never die.

1390
01:47:52,028 --> 01:47:54,528
So don't you worry about them.

1391
01:47:55,243 --> 01:47:57,692
Don't worry about them.

1392
01:47:58,524 --> 01:47:59,624
But...

1393
01:47:59,827 --> 01:48:03,527
but they don't look anything like us,

1394
01:48:04,322 --> 01:48:06,022
how can they go?

1395
01:48:08,219 --> 01:48:09,819
That's where my powers come in.

1396
01:48:10,626 --> 01:48:12,466
I don't do much very well.

1397
01:48:12,524 --> 01:48:15,734
But that, that I do well.

1398
01:48:16,726 --> 01:48:20,026
And I'll make them look your twins.

1399
01:48:21,128 --> 01:48:22,188
You'll see.

1400
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:30,420
Father John.

1401
01:48:31,078 --> 01:48:32,148
I was wrong.

1402
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:34,131
I'm sorry.

1403
01:48:35,155 --> 01:48:37,455
Shu, you don't have to be sorry.

1404
01:48:38,428 --> 01:48:40,028
You don't have to be sorry.

1405
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:41,920
No, I was wrong.

1406
01:48:42,925 --> 01:48:43,625
What is it?

1407
01:48:45,024 --> 01:48:48,614
From the first day she came here,

1408
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:51,035
I felt uncomfortable.

1409
01:48:52,727 --> 01:48:54,147
I thought

1410
01:48:55,074 --> 01:48:56,569
she was not good.

1411
01:48:57,272 --> 01:48:58,872
I even thought

1412
01:48:59,028 --> 01:49:02,428
both of you were not good.

1413
01:49:03,272 --> 01:49:04,422
That's ok.

1414
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:06,582
I want to say to her,

1415
01:49:06,677 --> 01:49:07,937
sorry.

1416
01:49:08,373 --> 01:49:10,433
And say to you,

1417
01:49:10,472 --> 01:49:11,782
I'm sorry.

1418
01:49:12,147 --> 01:49:14,347
You don't have to say you're sorry.

1419
01:49:17,725 --> 01:49:20,125
You got nothing to be sorry about.

1420
01:49:38,278 --> 01:49:41,028
I had seen many people pray before,

1421
01:49:41,072 --> 01:49:42,722
but that night, the sight of

1422
01:49:42,746 --> 01:49:44,026
John's back as he prayed

1423
01:49:44,069 --> 01:49:46,609
would stay with me
for the rest of my life.

1424
01:49:54,169 --> 01:49:56,309
They brought new uniforms.

1425
01:50:00,023 --> 01:50:02,113
Our old uniforms were torn,

1426
01:50:02,525 --> 01:50:04,525
so I brought you new ones.

1427
01:50:04,624 --> 01:50:06,914
Father Ingleman wanted us

1428
01:50:07,023 --> 01:50:08,373
to wear then for Chrismas.

1429
01:50:08,524 --> 01:50:10,024
You don't mind me wearing it?

1430
01:50:10,374 --> 01:50:11,994
The sleeves are short.

1431
01:50:12,475 --> 01:50:13,515
Try it on.

1432
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:17,260
Big sister.

1433
01:50:22,227 --> 01:50:24,127
I can't button it up for you.

1434
01:50:24,174 --> 01:50:26,454
I'm already skinnier from starvation.

1435
01:50:26,821 --> 01:50:27,751
You are not built like a student,

1436
01:50:27,826 --> 01:50:30,326
more like a student's wet nurse!

1437
01:50:36,231 --> 01:50:37,371
I have an idea,

1438
01:50:37,519 --> 01:50:39,019
to fool the Japanese,

1439
01:50:39,122 --> 01:50:40,222
let's use the curtains

1440
01:50:40,277 --> 01:50:41,597
to make the uniforms fit,

1441
01:50:41,619 --> 01:50:42,899
and tear up the sheets

1442
01:50:42,922 --> 01:50:43,822
to wrap our chests.

1443
01:50:43,874 --> 01:50:45,724
So, our boobs won't pop out.

1444
01:52:09,924 --> 01:52:11,724
What're we doing, George?

1445
01:52:11,819 --> 01:52:12,909
what're we doing?

1446
01:52:12,969 --> 01:52:14,969
Listen, your God teaches,

1447
01:52:15,023 --> 01:52:16,723
everybody born equal right?

1448
01:52:16,822 --> 01:52:19,062
So, the women, the girls, which?

1449
01:52:20,698 --> 01:52:22,278
What would you do?

1450
01:52:23,425 --> 01:52:24,785
We must.

1451
01:52:25,723 --> 01:52:27,623
What else we can do?

1452
01:52:35,018 --> 01:52:37,518
He gave me these bracelets

1453
01:52:37,623 --> 01:52:39,823
so I would go with him.

1454
01:52:39,925 --> 01:52:44,155
I didn't trust him enough so I didn't.

1455
01:52:44,621 --> 01:52:47,421
I should have.

1456
01:52:48,117 --> 01:52:49,187
I was so stupid.

1457
01:52:49,423 --> 01:52:51,123
You would be even more stupid

1458
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:52,323
wearing them to meet the Japs.

1459
01:52:52,422 --> 01:52:53,892
Leave them here.

1460
01:52:54,173 --> 01:52:56,283
Fine, they are yours now.

1461
01:53:00,184 --> 01:53:02,124
When I was your age,

1462
01:53:02,221 --> 01:53:04,611
I had already served countless men.

1463
01:53:04,718 --> 01:53:06,208
Little sister,

1464
01:53:06,326 --> 01:53:08,067
remember to give this back to me.

1465
01:53:08,118 --> 01:53:08,918
I will use the money

1466
01:53:08,921 --> 01:53:11,121
to buy myself out of my contract.

1467
01:53:16,491 --> 01:53:18,621
Big sister, I'm sorry.

1468
01:53:20,124 --> 01:53:23,023
Live a good life for me.

1469
01:53:29,324 --> 01:53:31,644
I don't have any things of value,

1470
01:53:31,723 --> 01:53:33,173
that cat is all I have.

1471
01:53:33,241 --> 01:53:35,021
He ran away the other day.

1472
01:53:35,125 --> 01:53:36,045
Little sister,

1473
01:53:36,323 --> 01:53:37,283
promise me,

1474
01:53:37,325 --> 01:53:39,045
you will find him.

1475
01:53:39,274 --> 01:53:40,124
OK.

1476
01:53:50,455 --> 01:53:52,025
Remember Dou?

1477
01:53:52,119 --> 01:53:54,299
She wasn't much taller than you.

1478
01:53:54,673 --> 01:53:56,633
Please take good care of it.

1479
01:53:56,717 --> 01:53:58,537
This is Dou's life.

1480
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:01,819
She wanted to play "The Qin Huai View,"

1481
01:54:02,019 --> 01:54:04,419
and for that she was killed.

1482
01:54:06,921 --> 01:54:08,521
"The Qin Huai View."

1483
01:54:09,672 --> 01:54:11,512
Is that a beautiful song?

1484
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:14,020
That's our signature
song at Jade Paradise.

1485
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:17,790
Why don't we sing it for Dou?

1486
01:54:17,923 --> 01:54:19,723
If was her dying wish after all.

1487
01:54:19,821 --> 01:54:21,621
Let's sing it for the girls,

1488
01:54:21,682 --> 01:54:23,852
so they remember us at our best!

1489
01:54:31,668 --> 01:54:36,168
<i>"I have a story,"</i>

1490
01:54:36,622 --> 01:54:41,622
<i>"and let me put it into song."</i>

1491
01:54:41,972 --> 01:54:46,722
<i>"I hope every one of you"</i>

1492
01:54:47,417 --> 01:54:51,627
<i>"can listen to me patiently."</i>

1493
01:54:52,622 --> 01:54:54,622
<i>"Allow me"</i>

1494
01:54:54,821 --> 01:55:01,181
<i>"to sing the legend
of the Qin Huai River,"</i>

1495
01:55:02,725 --> 01:55:07,065
<i>"slowly and passionately,"</i>

1496
01:55:07,918 --> 01:55:13,257
<i>"for each one of you."</i>

1497
01:55:21,023 --> 01:55:25,753
<i>"Ever since the ancient era,"</i>

1498
01:55:26,368 --> 01:55:30,688
<i>"the river has been flowing gracefully."</i>

1499
01:55:31,624 --> 01:55:35,894
<i>"It is beauty of the South,"</i>

1500
01:55:36,822 --> 01:55:41,102
<i>"the elegance of Nanking."</i>

1501
01:55:42,023 --> 01:55:44,623
<i>"Walk in the famous Zhan Palace,"</i>

1502
01:55:45,067 --> 01:55:51,397
<i>"enjoy the spectacular architecture."</i>

1503
01:55:52,023 --> 01:55:54,723
<i>"Look at the Colony of Cranes"</i>

1504
01:55:55,068 --> 01:55:57,318
<i>"with water rippling all around."</i>

1505
01:55:57,518 --> 01:56:03,018
<i>"What a paradise this is."</i>

1506
01:56:07,273 --> 01:56:09,173
Mo, would...

1507
01:56:10,982 --> 01:56:13,622
You look so sweet.

1508
01:56:17,722 --> 01:56:20,622
Would you mind... lying down?

1509
01:56:21,622 --> 01:56:23,969
I'm just not used to...

1510
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:25,620
People who can sit?

1511
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:28,370
Right, people who can sit.

1512
01:56:28,494 --> 01:56:29,524
Would you mind?

1513
01:56:29,617 --> 01:56:31,617
I understand, I don't mind.

1514
01:56:40,825 --> 01:56:43,625
So madam, what will it be?

1515
01:56:45,168 --> 01:56:47,388
Fourteen years old?

1516
01:56:48,123 --> 01:56:49,723
How about thirteen?

1517
01:56:54,122 --> 01:56:57,022
Until thirteen I was a good girl.

1518
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:58,922
Very good.

1519
01:56:59,116 --> 01:57:01,216
Thirteen it is.

1520
01:57:01,566 --> 01:57:03,616
So I'll straighten your hair

1521
01:57:03,752 --> 01:57:05,622
cut it in a bob.

1522
01:57:09,636 --> 01:57:10,836
I have an idea,

1523
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:14,670
I think it'll be beautiful.

1524
01:57:17,818 --> 01:57:19,288
This is what we need.

1525
01:57:20,618 --> 01:57:21,618
It's perfect.

1526
01:57:35,418 --> 01:57:37,965
The way you are now,

1527
01:57:38,648 --> 01:57:40,848
is what like the best.

1528
01:57:43,018 --> 01:57:45,118
I see you.

1529
01:57:46,674 --> 01:57:49,704
I see everything that you've been through.

1530
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:54,691
And I want all of that, Mo.

1531
01:57:54,724 --> 01:57:57,624
I want all of it.

1532
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,440
I love it.

1533
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,760
I love it all.

1534
01:58:04,455 --> 01:58:06,855
Are you going to fall in love with me?

1535
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:11,111
I already have.

1536
01:58:38,566 --> 01:58:40,256
I can do this.

1537
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:45,070
Sorry, these are not my clothes.

1538
01:58:51,767 --> 01:58:53,967
I wanna promise you something.

1539
01:58:55,921 --> 01:58:57,971
When this war is over,

1540
01:58:58,042 --> 01:59:00,122
I'm gonna find you,

1541
01:59:02,122 --> 01:59:04,622
and I'm gonna take you home.

1542
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:08,830
No.

1543
01:59:10,416 --> 01:59:13,216
After tonight,

1544
01:59:13,417 --> 01:59:16,667
my body will no longer be mine.

1545
01:59:21,617 --> 01:59:23,617
Take me home now.

1546
01:59:59,919 --> 02:00:01,309
Wow, Mo!

1547
02:00:01,318 --> 02:00:02,618
He can turn back time.

1548
02:00:02,721 --> 02:00:04,441
He chopped away five or six years!

1549
02:00:04,516 --> 02:00:06,636
Three more chops and we'd all be infants,

1550
02:00:06,814 --> 02:00:08,714
so we can start our lives over again!

1551
02:00:08,736 --> 02:00:09,946
Have you asked him,

1552
02:00:09,985 --> 02:00:11,715
where he learned such skills?

1553
02:00:12,314 --> 02:00:13,164
Mo,

1554
02:00:13,216 --> 02:00:15,316
ask him to cut hair too.

1555
02:00:16,217 --> 02:00:18,717
They all want you to give them a makeover.

1556
02:00:19,714 --> 02:00:20,864
My pleasure.

1557
02:00:20,923 --> 02:00:23,423
Glad to serve you.

1558
02:00:32,218 --> 02:00:33,238
Here.

1559
02:00:33,421 --> 02:00:35,351
He has to work with you lying down.

1560
02:00:36,315 --> 02:00:38,795
Right, he's a mortician,

1561
02:00:38,951 --> 02:00:40,471
he only know how to work on dead people.

1562
02:00:40,614 --> 02:00:42,054
Are they disturbed...

1563
02:00:42,917 --> 02:00:43,617
by the way I work?

1564
02:00:43,718 --> 02:00:44,648
Sorry.

1565
02:00:46,314 --> 02:00:47,754
He hopes you won't mind.

1566
02:00:48,869 --> 02:00:50,559
Whatever, who cares?

1567
02:00:50,615 --> 02:00:52,895
I just want to look
like pretty schoolgirl.

1568
02:00:53,405 --> 02:00:54,965
Give me a coat.

1569
02:01:06,957 --> 02:01:08,857
His hands are so soft.

1570
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,820
Mo, did he really work on the dead?

1571
02:01:11,417 --> 02:01:13,197
Mo, we're going to sleep.

1572
02:01:13,222 --> 02:01:15,112
Wake us up when it's our turn.

1573
02:01:27,771 --> 02:01:30,121
You've done this your whole life?

1574
02:01:30,421 --> 02:01:31,971
For five years.

1575
02:01:32,215 --> 02:01:34,715
You do this very well.

1576
02:01:39,113 --> 02:01:40,783
It matters.

1577
02:01:41,437 --> 02:01:43,217
It matters to me.

1578
02:01:44,956 --> 02:01:47,276
Before my daughter died,

1579
02:01:50,319 --> 02:01:52,319
She made me promise,

1580
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:55,240
to make her beautiful again.

1581
02:01:57,249 --> 02:01:59,399
That was the first time.

1582
02:02:01,051 --> 02:02:02,621
It's important.

1583
02:02:04,915 --> 02:02:06,615
It's important work.

1584
02:02:07,722 --> 02:02:09,002
I'm sorry.

1585
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:13,120
She would have been twelve.

1586
02:02:15,371 --> 02:02:16,811
Like the girls.

1587
02:02:17,619 --> 02:02:18,859
Yeah.

1588
02:02:48,066 --> 02:02:49,716
Mo, he's amazing!

1589
02:02:51,414 --> 02:02:52,934
If only my mother were alive,

1590
02:02:53,019 --> 02:02:54,479
she would have been so happy

1591
02:02:55,521 --> 02:02:56,091
to see me like this.

1592
02:02:56,251 --> 02:02:57,551
She said,

1593
02:02:58,169 --> 02:03:00,719
we never had a scholar in our family.

1594
02:03:03,469 --> 02:03:05,819
Now you are a scholar, so am I.

1595
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:07,671
My mother wouldn't recognize me either!

1596
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,570
Of course not.

1597
02:03:08,614 --> 02:03:10,084
We are now students.

1598
02:03:10,121 --> 02:03:11,621
Let's line up.

1599
02:03:12,114 --> 02:03:14,864
Mo, let him see if we
all look like students.

1600
02:03:20,621 --> 02:03:22,621
No need to count, we only have twelve.

1601
02:03:24,215 --> 02:03:25,615
We are one short.

1602
02:03:28,612 --> 02:03:30,612
How many did the Japanese say?

1603
02:03:33,221 --> 02:03:34,221
How many?

1604
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:37,019
Thirteen.

1605
02:03:37,269 --> 02:03:38,019
How many?

1606
02:03:38,215 --> 02:03:41,235
Thirteen. We only have twelve here.

1607
02:03:42,619 --> 02:03:44,319
This is a terrible joke.

1608
02:03:45,832 --> 02:03:47,712
One of the students still has to go!

1609
02:03:47,818 --> 02:03:49,318
We did all of this for nothing!

1610
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:55,501
I will go.

1611
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:58,620
What did he say?

1612
02:03:58,871 --> 02:04:00,091
I will go.

1613
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:01,410
George.

1614
02:04:01,671 --> 02:04:02,921
He said he would go.

1615
02:04:04,467 --> 02:04:05,567
What are you talking about?

1616
02:04:05,649 --> 02:04:06,889
You are a boy!

1617
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:16,615
Father Ingleman ask me
to protect students.

1618
02:04:16,664 --> 02:04:18,364
But I'm not good.

1619
02:04:18,463 --> 02:04:20,113
I'm... I'm terrible.

1620
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:21,830
I'm... I'm bad.

1621
02:04:21,914 --> 02:04:24,064
Who cares if we are one short?

1622
02:04:24,114 --> 02:04:25,044
We will just say that

1623
02:04:25,115 --> 02:04:26,415
one of us has died from an illness.

1624
02:04:26,445 --> 02:04:27,625
My grandma told me that

1625
02:04:27,714 --> 02:04:29,064
the Japanese can't count.

1626
02:04:29,717 --> 02:04:30,697
We can't do that!

1627
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:32,063
The Japanese are very astute!

1628
02:04:32,118 --> 02:04:33,968
They will search everywhere,

1629
02:04:34,015 --> 02:04:35,965
and it will be the end for the students!

1630
02:04:36,016 --> 02:04:37,196
There is nothing you can do.

1631
02:04:37,238 --> 02:04:38,868
They will see that you are a boy.

1632
02:04:38,916 --> 02:04:40,566
You can't fool them...

1633
02:04:40,614 --> 02:04:42,614
Yes, It's too obvious.

1634
02:04:42,711 --> 02:04:43,831
It's a short distance

1635
02:04:43,914 --> 02:04:44,914
from the church to the car.

1636
02:04:44,961 --> 02:04:45,961
If I am made-up as a girl,

1637
02:04:46,014 --> 02:04:47,014
Lower my head,

1638
02:04:47,061 --> 02:04:49,618
and walk right behind you all,

1639
02:04:49,664 --> 02:04:51,214
I'm sure the Japanese won't notice!

1640
02:04:52,313 --> 02:04:53,953
If we have one missing,

1641
02:04:54,015 --> 02:04:55,635
the Japanese will find out,

1642
02:04:55,714 --> 02:04:58,044
then... a big trouble.

1643
02:04:58,318 --> 02:04:59,818
You are good at make-up.

1644
02:05:00,866 --> 02:05:02,186
You can do for me.

1645
02:05:02,217 --> 02:05:04,611
George, I'm not that good.

1646
02:05:04,665 --> 02:05:06,215
No, you can.

1647
02:05:06,612 --> 02:05:07,812
George, stop it.

1648
02:05:07,918 --> 02:05:09,558
- It can't work.
- You can!

1649
02:05:11,718 --> 02:05:13,568
The church to the car

1650
02:05:13,616 --> 02:05:15,206
just a short way!

1651
02:05:15,252 --> 02:05:16,712
You are good at make-up,

1652
02:05:16,767 --> 02:05:18,077
you can do for me!

1653
02:05:18,814 --> 02:05:21,014
I will lower my head!

1654
02:05:21,381 --> 02:05:24,391
It's possible, it's just a short way!

1655
02:05:28,224 --> 02:05:29,324
You can.

1656
02:05:29,613 --> 02:05:30,873
It's possible.

1657
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:41,110
You know what could happen?

1658
02:06:41,813 --> 02:06:43,853
Yes, yes, I know.

1659
02:06:44,618 --> 02:06:48,618
I can do what Father Ingleman tell me.

1660
02:06:50,113 --> 02:06:51,553
Amazing.

1661
02:06:52,613 --> 02:06:53,883
I think I hear

1662
02:06:53,965 --> 02:06:56,155
what the Father is saying right now.

1663
02:06:56,215 --> 02:06:57,115
Yes?

1664
02:06:57,218 --> 02:06:57,788
Yeah.

1665
02:06:58,610 --> 02:06:59,760
What he saying?

1666
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:01,640
I think he's saying...

1667
02:07:02,736 --> 02:07:05,006
that you've done an incredible...

1668
02:07:05,069 --> 02:07:09,269
an incredible job,
taking care of the girls.

1669
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:12,440
And that you're good, so good.

1670
02:07:14,212 --> 02:07:16,872
And I think he's also asking...

1671
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:20,620
what the hell are you doing...

1672
02:07:20,872 --> 02:07:23,672
with that awful wig on your head?

1673
02:07:44,961 --> 02:07:48,011
This was the last time I saw George Chen.

1674
02:07:48,016 --> 02:07:50,915
When he was six years old,

1675
02:07:50,968 --> 02:07:52,228
and almost died of starvation,

1676
02:07:52,714 --> 02:07:54,614
Father Ingleman saved him.

1677
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:57,100
He rang the church bell, swept the floor,

1678
02:07:57,109 --> 02:07:58,819
and worked in the kitchen.

1679
02:07:58,911 --> 02:08:00,051
We used to laugh at him,

1680
02:08:00,134 --> 02:08:02,734
Whenever he spoke in English

1681
02:08:03,015 --> 02:08:04,915
or in Nanking dialect.

1682
02:08:16,594 --> 02:08:18,714
You know that,

1683
02:08:19,077 --> 02:08:21,367
you can't really go there.

1684
02:08:21,409 --> 02:08:24,609
You gotta escape somehow
before you get there.

1685
02:08:24,628 --> 02:08:28,448
You gotta jump from the car
or the truck or whatever.

1686
02:08:28,552 --> 02:08:30,312
You wait until it slows down,

1687
02:08:30,365 --> 02:08:31,555
goes around the corner,

1688
02:08:32,556 --> 02:08:32,726
That's when you jump.

1689
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:35,090
No, I'm no jumping.

1690
02:08:35,111 --> 02:08:36,271
Don't teach me

1691
02:08:36,316 --> 02:08:37,316
Why not?

1692
02:08:37,412 --> 02:08:38,532
If I jump,

1693
02:08:39,717 --> 02:08:41,917
Japanese will find out.

1694
02:08:42,315 --> 02:08:43,965
I will go all the way,

1695
02:08:44,012 --> 02:08:48,132
give you more time. You and the girls

1696
02:08:49,122 --> 02:08:51,082
get out of the church.

1697
02:09:06,318 --> 02:09:07,318
Hide your weapons well.

1698
02:09:07,516 --> 02:09:08,616
Don't let the Japanese see.

1699
02:09:08,661 --> 02:09:09,611
Don't worry,

1700
02:09:09,732 --> 02:09:11,732
at least we will get an eyeball.

1701
02:09:21,682 --> 02:09:23,712
Have you got something as well?

1702
02:09:59,336 --> 02:10:02,316
Following our commander's order,

1703
02:10:02,335 --> 02:10:04,115
I'm here to pick up the students.

1704
02:10:07,664 --> 02:10:10,124
Here is a gift bag from our troops.

1705
02:10:10,714 --> 02:10:12,164
Please accept it.

1706
02:10:35,424 --> 02:10:36,724
What are you doing here?

1707
02:10:37,812 --> 02:10:38,832
Mr. Kato.

1708
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:42,819
Have you spoken with Colonel Hasegawa?

1709
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:44,690
My daughter,

1710
02:10:44,916 --> 02:10:47,816
she doesn't have to go, right?

1711
02:10:48,456 --> 02:10:50,296
The order is from the chief commander.

1712
02:10:50,396 --> 02:10:52,616
Even Colonel Hasegawa can't interfere.

1713
02:10:52,713 --> 02:10:53,903
Get out.

1714
02:10:54,270 --> 02:10:55,470
Mr. Kato.

1715
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:56,870
But you promised to help.

1716
02:10:56,928 --> 02:10:57,628
Shut up!

1717
02:10:59,717 --> 02:11:01,967
The chief commander is in charge.

1718
02:11:02,011 --> 02:11:03,041
Look,

1719
02:11:03,313 --> 02:11:05,013
he sent troops just for this.

1720
02:11:05,167 --> 02:11:06,917
We can't do anything.

1721
02:11:07,916 --> 02:11:10,146
But we had a deal.

1722
02:11:10,709 --> 02:11:13,879
I have given you all of my valuables.

1723
02:11:14,315 --> 02:11:15,285
Mr. Kato.

1724
02:11:15,314 --> 02:11:17,014
Please, you promised!

1725
02:11:17,112 --> 02:11:19,212
When did I take your things?

1726
02:11:23,867 --> 02:11:26,617
That was for our military expenses.

1727
02:11:31,113 --> 02:11:32,193
Then I'm begging you,

1728
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:34,610
please allow me to see

1729
02:11:34,704 --> 02:11:36,904
my daughter one last time.

1730
02:13:18,612 --> 02:13:21,552
I'm not a student. I won't go!

1731
02:13:21,609 --> 02:13:23,609
I won't go!

1732
02:13:23,658 --> 02:13:26,798
I'm not a student!

1733
02:13:27,489 --> 02:13:28,709
Isn't that your daughter?

1734
02:13:28,864 --> 02:13:30,194
What is she saying?

1735
02:13:30,202 --> 02:13:31,252
Why is she shouting?

1736
02:13:32,208 --> 02:13:33,948
I'm not a student!

1737
02:13:38,311 --> 02:13:40,151
I'm not a student!

1738
02:13:41,626 --> 02:13:43,326
I won't go!

1739
02:13:50,913 --> 02:13:53,213
Be gentle with her, she's just a girl.

1740
02:14:07,188 --> 02:14:09,388
You've seen your daughter.

1741
02:15:00,107 --> 02:15:01,107
Let's go.

1742
02:15:01,129 --> 02:15:01,829
Come on.

1743
02:15:20,413 --> 02:15:21,113
Shu.

1744
02:15:22,212 --> 02:15:23,302
Come here.

1745
02:15:25,609 --> 02:15:28,099
Your father is a good man.

1746
02:15:28,158 --> 02:15:29,408
We could never have done this...

1747
02:15:29,412 --> 02:15:30,812
without your father.

1748
02:15:30,828 --> 02:15:32,128
He's a good man.

1749
02:15:38,447 --> 02:15:40,147
Watch your legs.

1750
02:17:25,875 --> 02:17:27,375
John told me that his biggest regret

1751
02:17:27,383 --> 02:17:28,213
was that, because

1752
02:17:28,254 --> 02:17:30,306
we had to get out as quickly as possible,

1753
02:17:30,858 --> 02:17:33,608
he couldn't give my
father a proper burial.

1754
02:18:02,511 --> 02:18:05,811
Is this good for me to go through?

1755
02:18:09,107 --> 02:18:10,547
What's on the truck?

1756
02:18:14,734 --> 02:18:16,604
Empty wine cases, but...

1757
02:18:17,106 --> 02:18:18,706
four of them are full. They are...

1758
02:18:18,826 --> 02:18:20,606
very good, very good.

1759
02:18:20,755 --> 02:18:21,605
Here.

1760
02:18:22,009 --> 02:18:24,109
You see, vintage.

1761
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,620
If you would like some.

1762
02:18:27,607 --> 02:18:28,897
Open it.

1763
02:18:34,309 --> 02:18:35,189
These.

1764
02:18:36,113 --> 02:18:37,133
Take.

1765
02:19:18,708 --> 02:19:20,108
Until this day

1766
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:22,200
I still don't know what happened

1767
02:19:22,254 --> 02:19:23,804
told the women of the Qin Huai River.

1768
02:19:23,903 --> 02:19:27,003
I never learned all of their names,

1769
02:19:27,144 --> 02:19:28,444
And never saw them

1770
02:19:28,556 --> 02:19:30,606
being taken away by the Japanese.

1771
02:19:30,756 --> 02:19:32,806
So, I always imagine...

1772
02:19:32,909 --> 02:19:33,909
I imagine myself standing

1773
02:19:34,011 --> 02:19:35,411
by the large round window,

1774
02:19:35,412 --> 02:19:37,412
watching them walk in once again.

1775
02:19:37,413 --> 02:19:38,413
