1
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,056
Sir?

2
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:05,000
Sir, Everything is
loaded into the truck. Sir

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,562
All we're leaving in the morning.

4
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,510
According to our intelligence reports,

5
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,526
the Japanese are here,
here, here and here.

6
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:31,049
And they are completely
surrounded by our forces.

7
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,771
So Japanese shouldn't be there then.

8
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:35,048
No. You're wrong.

9
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:38,378
According to our
British Intelligence reports,

10
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:43,023
the Japanese are here,
here, here and here.

11
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:45,105
And both sides are equal strength

12
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,589
This is ridiculous. According to
our French intelligence reports

13
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:51,953
All those area there are
no Japanese left them all.

14
00:01:51,953 --> 00:02:01,683
It's not true. All you're...

15
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:04,767
Gentlemen. It is bad news for you.

16
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:07,842
The Japanese arrived here.

17
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:15,619
I occupy here, you, you, you,
tell me, tell me, you.

18
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,584
French Major General Pierre Retreat.

19
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,826
British Major General Robert Foste

20
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:26,792
American Major General Amberhang Wakins

21
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:31,109
Africa Major General Gabyi Zakro.

22
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:37,599
So I am. President. Hands up

23
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,934
Our four General have been captured.

24
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,096
If this news disseminates,

25
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:50,418
Our sentiment will be
adversely affected.

26
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:53,502
Be quiet.

27
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:56,625
The best way is

28
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,308
before the news is known.

29
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,751
We have to save our General.

30
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,794
The agenda of today's meeting is

31
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:06,914
who will lead our task force?

32
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,280
The number 7 agent

33
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,722
is on duty in South Africa.

34
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,244
The bald detective

35
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:16,367
has deflective.

36
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:20,972
King of Snake is dead.

37
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:25,574
Rocky is not suitable for
this military action.

38
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,299
Captain Hei-hu retired

39
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,744
to forming a family.

40
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,466
Who is he?

41
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,303
Captain of Devil, Duan-hun.

42
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,472
His bravery is well known.

43
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:16,475
This is not ajob for
ordinary task force.

44
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,593
I don't think so.

45
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:27,968
I am General Qiang-chun, this
is General Tang Mu-shen.

46
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,331
I told you the backdrop on the phone.

47
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:34,295
According to the information, General
Si-wei is being held in Luxembourg.

48
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:37,338
In four days time, Japanese will

49
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:40,652
take back to Japan for propaganda.

50
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,504
I order you to organize
a special task force.

51
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,189
Capturing the hostage
in four days time.

52
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,074
Remember, our mouth is shut

53
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:51,745
whatever happens.

54
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:19,265
I love everything that flies in
the air or crawls on the ground.

55
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:23,550
Send me the best food,
I will take all.

56
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,633
My friend, send me the best food.

57
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:30,758
I enjoy the food and drinks,
the bill are yours.

58
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:33,842
My stomach is full of crabs.

59
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:37,759
I have a good appetite.

60
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,935
Ha, ha

61
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:49,499
Give me a dozen of beer on ice.

62
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,542
I can take more than
ten pieces of steak.

63
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:57,067
My friend, send me the best wine.

64
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,510
I enjoy the food and drinks,
the bill are yours.

65
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,234
My stomach can take all kind of food.

66
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:07,596
I have a good appetite.

67
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:14,888
Delicious food, ha, ha.

68
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:27,858
I enjoy the food and drinks,
the bill are yours.

69
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,438
Oh, I am your dad.

70
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,730
Dad.

71
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:46,227
Don't move, this is a robbery.

72
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:14,574
Cut it off, I give up.

73
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:25,512
It's all yours.

74
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,602
Don't be cheeky.

75
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,573
Yes.

76
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:46,418
Oh, I thought I was a dead meat.

77
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,538
I got ajob for you.

78
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:48,900
You got the right man.

79
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,784
I can manage all jobs.

80
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:54,459
We are not ordinary Joe.

81
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,485
Damn, you did it on purpose.

82
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,441
So what?

83
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:22,606
Forget about it.

84
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,697
What? You can't leave
after having my food.

85
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:09,778
Who are you?

86
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,297
I know who you are, it
doesn't matter who I am.

87
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,859
Cao Shang-fei, the escape specialist.

88
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:23,393
What do you want?

89
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:26,437
According to the escaping record,

90
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:29,400
you did New York six times, London
three times, China eight times.

91
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,602
You escaped within a day

92
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:35,527
in Japan, is it right?

93
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:35,968
So you know

94
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,170
why do you bother to take me in?

95
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,053
You can't escape for your whole life.

96
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:42,936
I can delete your escape file,

97
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,138
as long as you promise a thing.

98
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,142
Really? Forget about a thing.

99
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:53,427
I can promise a hundred things.

100
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,995
Fool, I know you would run.

101
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,446
Say it, what do you want me to do?

102
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,251
We want to make use of you
to help someone escape.

103
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,534
Ladies and gentlemen.

104
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:18,015
Welcome to

105
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:22,730
this fight being held
at the National Square.

106
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,186
The one coming out is the Japan Killer.

107
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:35,995
The next one is King of
Orange from New York.

108
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:39,078
Our music is unbearable.

109
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,762
Bear with it for doing Thai boxing.

110
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,765
We got the band from the cinema.

111
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,609
What? Cinema?

112
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,885
Laugh.

113
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,534
If we win,

114
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:54,810
we will be rich.

115
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,789
Yes.

116
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:42,054
You look smart.

117
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:50,335
Take it, we have a full house.

118
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,387
You take it.

119
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,203
Take it easy.

120
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:17,015
Take it.

121
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:19,369
Hurry.

122
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,681
Two pieces of laxative will do him.

123
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:40,482
Have you got it?

124
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:40,922
You are next.

125
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:42,164
What are you doing? Trying to kill me.

126
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,686
You can kill yourself.

127
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:44,402
I didn't tell you to.

128
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,487
I am the Japan Killer.

129
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,689
He changed my pills.

130
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:47,327
I will kill you.

131
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,612
What a shame what you have done?

132
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:53,929
It's not right, I hate you.

133
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:00,985
The fight begins.

134
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,547
Wait...

135
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,229
Is there any rules?

136
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,426
No.

137
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,197
Cow, pick yourself up.

138
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:24,239
I am leaving, I am out.

139
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,440
Look at that money;
it is ours if we win.

140
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,163
Come on.

141
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:41,418
Cow, come on.

142
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:43,216
No.

143
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:27,661
Cow, we are rich.

144
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:32,114
I am rich.

145
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:44,008
Cow, run for your life.

146
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:45,728
This is my life saver.

147
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,214
If you carry on like this,
you can't run away.

148
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:49,774
Stay where you are?

149
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:50,656
This is illegal gambling.

150
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:51,496
This is a fifteen years sentence.

151
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:55,781
What? Fifteen years.

152
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:57,694
Ten years.

153
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:59,745
Five years.

154
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,792
It will soon be fifteen years.

155
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:06,553
You are not guilty,
you are free to go.

156
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,705
Yes.

157
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:20,008
There isn't enough evidence,
you are freed.

158
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:22,924
Thank you.

159
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:26,576
The more the better

160
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:32,339
It's enough for us to
be rich for a while.

161
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:42,088
Last month, you used the same trick

162
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:45,091
to make a lot of money.

163
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,446
Leave the money and run.

164
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,460
I am leaving.

165
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:38,249
You know coming back.

166
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:43,176
It has been a year.

167
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:47,548
I won't leave this time.

168
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:49,631
I have heard it too many times.

169
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,833
I mean it this time.

170
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:56,718
I can swear, do I look like a liar?

171
00:23:56,718 --> 00:24:01,354
Do I look like a liar?

172
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:05,809
If you lie again, I will kill you.

173
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:10,174
Take it easy, I won't leave you again.

174
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:12,056
Listen,

175
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:14,699
I have met so many women.

176
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,982
I like none of them but you.

177
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:18,062
What? What did you call me?

178
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,105
Xiao-hui.

179
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,147
Nicy.

180
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:22,348
No.

181
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:24,229
Yes, I got it, you are Lucy.

182
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,029
Say mum.

183
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:52,421
Lei-li, you are up early.

184
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:56,345
Would you like breakfast?

185
00:24:56,345 --> 00:25:00,309
Lei-li.

186
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:11,352
Damn.

187
00:25:56,453 --> 00:25:58,175
Hay, you still enjoy fooling people.

188
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:00,931
I just want to test if
you have gone rusty.

189
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:05,101
Oh yes, there is ajob for you.

190
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:11,149
But, I can't do it.

191
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:12,791
Get someone else.

192
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:17,076
What a pity, I got Sun
and Cao Shang-fei.

193
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,479
We can make money out of it.

194
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,721
Oh, Sir.

195
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:23,403
Sir, to be with Sun and Cao Shang-fei

196
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:26,807
and making money, I
will do it whatever.

197
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,769
But you got woman, what about her?

198
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:33,929
She, I... don't know her.

199
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,958
Please.

200
00:29:11,312 --> 00:29:13,193
This is nice, full of lives.

201
00:29:13,193 --> 00:29:16,588
This is war, go on.

202
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:18,399
Oh, mind the flying bullet.

203
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,153
Mind your hand.

204
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,928
You are surrounded.

205
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:28,130
Give up your arms,

206
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,334
and surrender, this
is your last chance.

207
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:34,727
Otherwise, we will fire.

208
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,622
Who dares to move, I will kill him.

209
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:40,304
Wait, what do you want?

210
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:44,548
This is a matter between us.

211
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,108
It's not your business,
I will leave with him.

212
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,953
Retreat.

213
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,105
I don't want to harm any of you.

214
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:54,680
Please.

215
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,681
She will fire.

216
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:56,602
Again.

217
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,765
We can talk this over.

218
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:01,768
Shit, there is nothing we can talk.

219
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:04,652
Who do you think I am?
I warned you already.

220
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:05,252
I am not kidding.

221
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:09,337
Lei-li, it's full of people,
it's not worth it.

222
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,619
I am full of explosives.

223
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,535
If you want to play tricks,
we will all die.

224
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:19,938
Get in the car.

225
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:24,704
Move.

226
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:27,677
Sir, I don't know how to drive.

227
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:28,238
What?

228
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:33,684
Rubbish, start the car.

229
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes, I will.

230
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:04,307
I got him.

231
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:13,208
Entering the barrack and taking the
hostage, this is a death sentence.

232
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:13,929
Death sentence?

233
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:18,855
It's only a life, it's up to you.

234
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:22,619
Sir, you must let her go.

235
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,019
She is all right.

236
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:25,536
I can guarantee it with my life.

237
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,269
You can leave.

238
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:34,833
I can leave so is he?

239
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,475
This is a matter of life and death.

240
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:39,197
You can't leave me out.

241
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,040
I can swear, I am not
making fun out of it.

242
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
It's my duty.

243
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,563
I know you.

244
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,726
I can swear, I won't... swear.

245
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:47,566
If you don't believe,
you can ask them.

246
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:48,688
I did it for the money.

247
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:49,689
Oh.

248
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,812
Billy.

249
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,533
Oh... I.

250
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:56,217
You should have told me.

251
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:58,859
I will follow you even
if it costs my life.

252
00:31:58,859 --> 00:31:59,337
I am in.

253
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:17,601
Being brave to attack.

254
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:20,163
You have to keep it up day and night.

255
00:32:20,163 --> 00:32:24,605
I will do it at all costs.

256
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:34,615
You will be chosen on merit only.

257
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:45,472
Do you like her? Do the chasing.

258
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:47,145
I wouldn't dare.

259
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:51,678
It's only hero who can match beauty.

260
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:55,312
You are not heroic for her.

261
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:58,841
See me.

262
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,444
It's yours.

263
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,575
Thank you.

264
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:19,590
What a lemon?

265
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,152
What ajoke?

266
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,670
When I got money, I will
have all the women I want.

267
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,791
Sun, when you have money?
What do you want?

268
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,602
I have been wandering without home.

269
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:39,170
When I have money, I will get a house.

270
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:43,777
Get married with a healthy woman.

271
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:46,981
She will give me a army of children.

272
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:50,304
I will teach them all I know.

273
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:53,428
I am different.

274
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:56,912
When I have money, I have a wish

275
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:57,552
to leave you all.

276
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:58,394
Why?

277
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:02,999
Because I will be involved one day,

278
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:08,841
I wouldn't run away from you all.

279
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:10,768
Sir, what about it?

280
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:12,248
I haven't thought about it.

281
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,211
Be careful, I might
take all the money.

282
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:18,896
You won't get any share.

283
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,368
You can all dream about it.

284
00:34:36,196 --> 00:34:38,518
Don't move, can you hear me?

285
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:40,272
This is robbery.

286
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:08,232
I...

287
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,874
Give me all the money.

288
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:12,434
We will leave after getting the money.

289
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,516
Give me all the money.

290
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:25,247
Don't play tricks, be wise.

291
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:27,602
Get the money out.

292
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:34,782
You can get a 20)% % % off
for being a woman.

293
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,822
If I can do one with
you, you are free.

294
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,065
What about you?

295
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,881
You are familiar.

296
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,403
I swear you have never met.

297
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,845
Really?

298
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:59,129
Yes.

299
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:01,008
I remember.

300
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:05,015
The National Park, the Scottish leader

301
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:08,940
Yes, I recognize you.

302
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,304
We are thieves because of you.

303
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,265
It is a misunderstanding.

304
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:15,026
Where is our money?

305
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:17,269
Where is it?

306
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,465
Say it.

307
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:23,356
It's a misunderstanding.

308
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:24,438
Don't see it this way.

309
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:24,998
Robbing a thief.

310
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:28,517
Damn it, taking tiger's tooth.

311
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:45,541
Robbing a thief.

312
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:53,149
Sir, they want to kill me.

313
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:53,821
Let's go.

314
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,196
Let's run.

315
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:09,205
Wait for me, I will be back

316
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,952
Porridge.

317
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:32,954
Do you fancy one?

318
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:35,116
Excuse me; it's only enough for two.

319
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:37,474
Excuse me.

320
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:54,859
You don't want it.

321
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:56,817
Oh, I can't take it anymore.

322
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:35,697
Listen, it's dangerous, let's leave.

323
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,628
We will think of a way of leaving.

324
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:21,916
When a tree is down, the
dependents are gone.

325
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,559
Let's go home and get married.

326
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,403
Whoever mentions leaving
again, I will kill him.

327
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:29,965
Don't be cruel.

328
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:32,688
Mind your manner.

329
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:35,251
Yes, smarty.

330
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,214
Watch out, or I will kill you.

331
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:38,853
You dare.

332
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:40,738
Lei-li, you...

333
00:39:40,738 --> 00:39:43,049
So what? I like him.

334
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:06,323
What are you doing?

335
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:09,240
Let's go.

336
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:15,008
Does it hurt?

337
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:23,304
No.

338
00:40:25,748 --> 00:40:29,312
Oh, I didn't see anything.

339
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:31,032
It doesn't matter.

340
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,919
We are all men.

341
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:53,457
Damn it, don't play tricks.

342
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,619
That's enough.

343
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:02,069
We can't afford any internal conflicts.

344
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:07,354
We must work together
to finish ourjob.

345
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:11,117
Lei-li is right, I am sorry.

346
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:23,213
It's my fault, please forgive me.

347
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:26,376
Never mind, it's all over.

348
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:29,052
You are good.

349
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,226
I got a cigar which I treasure.

350
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,267
You must take it for my thankfulness.

351
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:38,029
No.

352
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:42,425
You must take it.

353
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,094
Wait, have you noticed.

354
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:01,936
We have been here for half a day.

355
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,779
We haven't seen anyone yet.

356
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:09,825
Are they all dead here?

357
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:14,381
Now you mention it, I can
sense something is wrong.

358
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,141
Don't worry, I am here.

359
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,237
Damn it.

360
00:44:17,127 --> 00:44:20,011
They haven't been visited by any male.

361
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:25,410
Especially those young and handsome.

362
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:27,412
Thank you.

363
00:45:19,037 --> 00:45:23,802
The only male among all females

364
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:27,126
We must enjoy it while we can.

365
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:30,410
You can't take them all.

366
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,368
Do you need our help?

367
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:36,336
Most of the men are dirty.

368
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:39,660
Your mentality and language
is dirty and evil.

369
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,942
You don't sound like a man.

370
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:42,984
Oh, yes.

371
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:47,068
I am an artist, full
of sense of beauty.

372
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:51,474
Any imperfect disappears

373
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:54,917
slightly and slowly.

374
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:58,401
Wait, I am a woman,
take a look of me.

375
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:02,285
Don't I look beautiful?

376
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:24,070
Thank you.

377
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,152
This is what I call perfect.

378
00:46:26,152 --> 00:46:28,435
You are one of them.

379
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:30,677
Full of remorse.

380
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:32,600
No, you misunderstand.

381
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,191
I am a hostage.

382
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:36,203
I have been degraded, he is the one.

383
00:46:36,203 --> 00:46:39,407
I... Lei-li, you are making it up.

384
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:41,810
Do you really hate him?

385
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,691
I do.

386
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:49,131
Kill him.

387
00:46:55,586 --> 00:47:00,871
No, but I love you.

388
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,468
Take him down.

389
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:08,720
Lei-li.

390
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,483
The day belongs to life and the night.

391
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:13,285
Any male who comes to this tribe?

392
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:16,326
He can't see tomorrow's sun.

393
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:29,102
No, I am begging you.

394
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:33,624
Please forgive me.

395
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,713
I have an old mum and a kid.

396
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:38,554
I am begging you

397
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:41,116
to forgive me.

398
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:55,652
I told you begging is useless.

399
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:57,094
I am telling you.

400
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:59,657
What is a real man?

401
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:47,778
You let me go already,
why did you get me back?

402
00:49:47,778 --> 00:49:49,981
He has been too hearty.

403
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:53,985
Any woman he likes, I will kill.

404
00:49:53,985 --> 00:49:54,782
How dare you?

405
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:01,794
I will kill you today.

406
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:03,434
I get you now; we will have
ginseng chicken today.

407
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:14,488
Sister, I didn't see anything.

408
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:15,319
I am here for the chicken, see you.

409
00:50:54,693 --> 00:50:56,926
You are a girl?

410
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:22,685
Fly, don't you like flying.

411
00:51:22,685 --> 00:51:24,643
Let's see if you can fly.

412
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,612
I can see you have a few tricks.

413
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:32,536
I am fighting for my life; don't
just watch it over there.

414
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:36,135
I am praising you.

415
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:40,945
Er-niu said it before,
I can't really fire.

416
00:51:40,945 --> 00:51:44,109
Boxing is my favorite.

417
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:45,190
Who is Er-niu?

418
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,752
My partner whom you met before.

419
00:51:46,752 --> 00:51:47,953
Do you listen to his advice?

420
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:49,796
I wouldn't.

421
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:51,597
We have agreed that

422
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:55,482
it's my say on all majors;
it's yours on petty things.

423
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:59,927
We haven't met any major yet.

424
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:02,770
So it was her idea to come to help me.

425
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:07,134
You are half right, she
told me to follow you.

426
00:52:07,134 --> 00:52:11,099
If you can survive this,
the money is yours.

427
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,020
What do you think?

428
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,378
We are on it together.

429
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:16,466
Thank you, see you later.

430
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,788
Where are you going?

431
00:52:18,788 --> 00:52:21,551
Your creditor is still
with the woman tribe.

432
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:24,512
If I don't go, I will
never get my money back.

433
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,598
Don't forget, I helped you before.

434
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:29,830
I didn't ask for you help.

435
00:52:32,403 --> 00:52:35,843
You can't tell the good from the evils.

436
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,919
What are you up to?

437
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:42,254
What do you want me to do?

438
00:52:42,254 --> 00:52:43,135
Take it off.

439
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,613
Taking what off?

440
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:50,223
Take it off.

441
00:52:50,223 --> 00:52:50,543
I know.

442
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:53,307
Can't you see they are hungry for sex?

443
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:54,028
Knowing what we are good at.

444
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:55,629
If we can perform to please them

445
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:57,511
they might let us go.

446
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:00,074
Take it off.

447
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:07,282
This is what you call hunger.

448
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:09,285
I... they are hungry.

449
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:11,038
Damn it.

450
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:38,595
Chase them, they are still around.

451
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,197
God, hurry, run.

452
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,811
Wait, Lei-li is still in their hands.

453
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,195
Damn it, we are surrounded.

454
00:55:59,195 --> 00:56:00,231
We must think of a way to escape.

455
00:56:00,717 --> 00:56:03,187
I will cover you, watch me.

456
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:45,164
It is over; they must have
gone through the water net.

457
00:57:03,908 --> 00:57:05,228
Lei-li.

458
00:57:13,118 --> 00:57:17,274
Where is she?

459
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:44,424
Let's spend a night here.

460
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:53,844
Wait, we don't know our enemies yet.

461
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:55,886
It may be a trap here.

462
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:58,528
Let me go in first.

463
00:58:10,382 --> 00:58:10,942
Is it all right?

464
00:58:10,942 --> 00:58:12,184
I didn't see any.

465
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:13,786
You have been boxing for
half a day in there.

466
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:16,389
This is called first move.

467
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:18,351
Oh, your head is broken.

468
00:58:18,351 --> 00:58:19,873
I couldn't have shot at the wall

469
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:22,235
and the rebound bullet hit my head.

470
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:24,229
Are you crazy?

471
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:44,007
Ghost.

472
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:44,968
It's inside the coffin.

473
00:59:44,968 --> 00:59:49,333
There is ghost inside the coffin.

474
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,966
What do you want? What do you up to?

475
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,423
There is.

476
01:00:08,715 --> 01:00:10,548
There is nothing.

477
01:00:11,398 --> 01:00:13,470
Don't go.

478
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:41,511
Oh, one is missing, let me join.

479
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:43,554
Are you passing through?

480
01:00:43,554 --> 01:00:46,469
Which one did you play?

481
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,162
I will kill you.

482
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:53,165
If you don't let me sleep,
I will kill you.

483
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:55,807
Do you know?

484
01:01:03,456 --> 01:01:05,259
Where are you going?

485
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:08,382
I will sleep in the coffin.

486
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:09,503
Would you like to join me?

487
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,938
No.

488
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:32,289
Please forgive me.

489
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,250
I don't know how I came in.

490
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,166
I don't know there is a beauty

491
01:01:41,779 --> 01:01:43,659
God, please help.

492
01:01:47,986 --> 01:01:52,064
Help, thank you for your mercy.

493
01:01:57,437 --> 01:01:59,800
God bless me, thank you.

494
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,880
Mum.

495
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,243
My kindness God.

496
01:02:06,447 --> 01:02:08,565
Thank you, God.

497
01:02:11,092 --> 01:02:15,417
Oh, what is it?

498
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:17,219
You are scared because I took a card.

499
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:21,820
I am warning you,
I will pick the winning card.

500
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,561
Mind your game manner.

501
01:02:39,644 --> 01:02:41,045
Damn it.

502
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:21,320
I got it, stop stealing card.

503
01:03:43,275 --> 01:03:46,199
The one sitting opposite
to me is a devil.

504
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:48,481
The black hand coming under the table

505
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:51,363
feeling my card.

506
01:03:52,406 --> 01:03:54,797
Really, let me see.

507
01:04:20,237 --> 01:04:22,549
Help.

508
01:04:33,652 --> 01:04:35,929
I have to shit.

509
01:04:36,575 --> 01:04:37,692
Shitting.

510
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:20,422
Thank you.

511
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:52,861
Little fool, don't say anything.

512
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:54,343
Put me to bed.

513
01:05:54,343 --> 01:05:57,338
Yes, I will take your order.

514
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:11,507
God of darkness, offering their blood.

515
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:31,671
Hurry, crossing the fire wall.

516
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:45,895
You are still alive, I
was sorry of your death.

517
01:08:45,895 --> 01:08:49,139
I worried about you.

518
01:08:49,139 --> 01:08:51,381
Don't worry, the evil lasts forever.

519
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,815
Do I look like a good guy?

520
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,111
It's nothing.

521
01:09:00,111 --> 01:09:01,593
They learned some black magic

522
01:09:01,593 --> 01:09:03,755
to scare people off.

523
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:04,676
The true is...

524
01:09:04,676 --> 01:09:06,509
Damn it, it's all because of you.

525
01:09:11,724 --> 01:09:12,725
We have been working hard.

526
01:09:12,725 --> 01:09:14,206
They must be inside.

527
01:09:14,206 --> 01:09:16,086
Let's rush in and kill them off.

528
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:42,350
Oh.

529
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:02,420
What is it? They are all dead.

530
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,779
Yes, it was far too easy
to have come through.

531
01:10:05,985 --> 01:10:08,427
Yes, it was easy.

532
01:10:08,427 --> 01:10:10,270
The Japanese died

533
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,432
without any chance of counter attack.

534
01:10:12,432 --> 01:10:15,476
Someone came before us for the hostage.

535
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:16,677
Don't shoot.

536
01:10:16,677 --> 01:10:19,079
It's us.

537
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:20,802
I was right, we are here to help.

538
01:10:20,802 --> 01:10:22,924
Good, we are being followed.

539
01:10:22,924 --> 01:10:24,565
Where is the hostage?

540
01:10:24,565 --> 01:10:25,487
What hostage?

541
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,409
Stop pretending; settle
the debt of $50)0), 0)0)0).

542
01:10:27,409 --> 01:10:29,411
$50)0), 0)0)0).

543
01:10:29,411 --> 01:10:30,092
Oh, you got it right.

544
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:32,375
I told you already.

545
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,736
Those ghosts being together

546
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:34,937
for some personal gains only.

547
01:10:34,937 --> 01:10:37,260
Cut off the crabs, I will
kill you if you don't pay.

548
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:39,102
You are a fool.

549
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:40,864
If I got the money,
I wouldn't be here.

550
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:41,224
Did you kill these people?

551
01:10:41,224 --> 01:10:43,387
We?

552
01:10:43,387 --> 01:10:44,616
We are not as good as you think.

553
01:12:56,536 --> 01:12:58,458
I know you are here for the hostage.

554
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,662
I can tell you where the hostage is.

555
01:13:01,662 --> 01:13:05,586
We stop fighting each other,
we want money only.

556
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:06,427
You can have the hostage

557
01:13:06,427 --> 01:13:08,350
as soon as you pay.

558
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,311
There must be demons around.

559
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:13,432
Damn it, that money disappeared.

560
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:18,201
Where are you going?

561
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:20,238
I have to piss when I am nervous.

562
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:29,608
It's a lot of money.

563
01:13:29,774 --> 01:13:32,085
Why the money is here?

564
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:35,100
We got a way out.

565
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,662
We can survive if we pay.

566
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:41,426
It's not easy to give
up this sum of money.

567
01:13:41,426 --> 01:13:44,270
Do we get a share?

568
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,713
Those who worked get a share.

569
01:13:47,713 --> 01:13:50,277
Yes, we live for money.

570
01:13:51,998 --> 01:13:53,560
Even if we give them the money,

571
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,923
they wouldn't let us live.

572
01:13:55,923 --> 01:13:59,166
We will take the money with us and
the alive will share the money.

573
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:02,410
Yes, the majority wins.

574
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:06,374
I won't die for sure.

575
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:10,259
I will retreat to give you
time to think it over.

576
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:13,742
We will wait until dawn.

577
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,064
When the first light appears

578
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:17,828
if you don't give up the money by them

579
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,219
we will come in.

580
01:14:24,955 --> 01:14:28,039
We got enough time to make

581
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:34,006
a time bomb, the last survivor

582
01:14:34,006 --> 01:14:36,088
will activate it so we all die.

583
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:38,844
Yes, if we die,
they will die with us.

584
01:14:42,735 --> 01:14:47,501
Cow, when this deal is over.

585
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:49,423
This will be our last deal.

586
01:14:49,423 --> 01:14:51,465
I will take your order.

587
01:14:51,465 --> 01:14:56,385
Yes, I want you to live on,
you can't die.

588
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:59,915
After tomorrow, I will
have a new plan.

589
01:14:59,915 --> 01:15:01,076
You will like it.

590
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:03,034
All right, I trust you one more time.

591
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:49,080
Being brave to attack

592
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,093
You have to keep it up day and night.

593
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:55,293
I will do it at all costs.

594
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:12,555
You will be chosen on merit only.

595
01:16:37,624 --> 01:16:40,227
I don't think we can
help at this battle.

596
01:16:40,227 --> 01:16:43,110
Not necessarily, I am prepared for it.

597
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,148
What is this damn thing?

598
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,756
This is an ancient firearm.

599
01:16:47,756 --> 01:16:48,836
One has show one's worth
before making money.

600
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:50,438
I spent fifty dollars

601
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:51,600
to get it from the vendor.

602
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,354
Let's see how powerful it can be.

603
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:02,052
It worth's every cent of it.

604
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:03,213
Damn, it's powerful.

605
01:17:03,213 --> 01:17:05,171
Even if it doesn't kill someone,
it will kill me.

606
01:17:34,528 --> 01:17:37,131
How beautiful you are when you kill.

607
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,485
Disgusting.

608
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:45,453
Concentrate, stop sweet talking.

609
01:17:46,302 --> 01:17:47,496
Be careful.

610
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:52,468
What?

611
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:54,347
I am alright.

612
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:57,274
I told you to be careful,
you are careless.

613
01:17:57,274 --> 01:18:01,875
Don't worry; you don't
have to guard me.

614
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:50,323
Damn it, you are really.

615
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:53,656
Thank you.

616
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:58,342
Shi-tou, I have known you for a long
time you showed your real self today.

617
01:18:58,342 --> 01:19:02,021
The leader is proud of you.

618
01:19:02,346 --> 01:19:04,260
How are you Shi-tou?

619
01:19:11,998 --> 01:19:18,444
Shi-tou, you can't die.

620
01:19:18,444 --> 01:19:21,368
I won't allow you to die.

621
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:30,491
Leader, I can't finish your order.

622
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:48,072
Damn it, Shi-tou is so honest,
but you killed him.

623
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,879
I will kill you.

624
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:14,139
Damn it, counter attack.

625
01:20:33,809 --> 01:20:36,252
We can only survive if
we can get some arms.

626
01:20:36,252 --> 01:20:39,406
You cover me, I will get some arms.

627
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:47,344
Wait, Lei-li, I hope
you can think like this.

628
01:20:47,344 --> 01:20:50,387
After we have our share of money,

629
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,430
we will settle down in a place.

630
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:56,268
You will bear our children.

631
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:01,720
But I... will be a pig.

632
01:21:02,882 --> 01:21:03,872
Let's go.

633
01:21:18,379 --> 01:21:19,894
Lei-li.

634
01:21:24,065 --> 01:21:25,420
Listen to me.

635
01:22:10,838 --> 01:22:13,201
Cow, you are something.

636
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:13,678
We are rich now.

637
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:22,130
Oh, why did you appearjust like this?

638
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:23,451
The money will be cut
by one more share.

639
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,095
Leader, you are still alive.

640
01:22:26,095 --> 01:22:27,769
But they have all sacrificed.

641
01:22:28,418 --> 01:22:31,253
What is it?

642
01:22:35,946 --> 01:22:37,984
I am Sun.

643
01:22:45,317 --> 01:22:46,956
Aren't we in the same gang/

644
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,514
Why did you kill him?

645
01:22:51,764 --> 01:22:55,448
It is always the outsider who
reaps the benefit of a fight.

646
01:22:55,448 --> 01:22:58,171
They died for me.

647
01:22:58,171 --> 01:22:59,571
How cruel.

648
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:02,096
Don't blame me, who
doesn't want money.

649
01:23:02,096 --> 01:23:04,017
Blame them for being a fool.

650
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:06,100
I understand.

651
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,582
It looked like they worked for you.

652
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:13,068
The reality is you hired
a gang of people

653
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:14,629
to fight with them,
what a faultless plan.

654
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:19,274
You made money without being known.

655
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:20,316
You are only guessing.

656
01:23:20,316 --> 01:23:21,597
This is his business; it's
none of our business.

657
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:22,839
Believe me; we don't know any of this.

658
01:23:22,839 --> 01:23:24,671
See you.

659
01:23:25,962 --> 01:23:28,115
I only believe dead people,

660
01:23:29,606 --> 01:23:32,850
because the dead mouth can't talk.

661
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:33,920
If you dare.

662
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:44,079
You should have been here earlier.

663
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:46,311
Why are you so late?

664
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:53,690
What kind of attitude is
it? What unit you are in?

665
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,491
Do you know who are we?

666
01:28:54,491 --> 01:28:56,848
We are the Lieutenant General.

667
01:28:57,454 --> 01:29:00,814
Never heard of it.

668
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:03,573
Hello.

669
01:29:06,384 --> 01:29:08,058
THE END
