1
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,200
- Bombs!
- They're bombing us!

2
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Rosetta !

3
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,600
Rosetta ! Rosetta !

4
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh, my God, she's going to die!
Arnaldo, get me some water.

5
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,500
Will you get me a glass of water!

6
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,700
Rosetta !

7
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,100
Signora...

8
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Please, Rosetta.
try to drink some water.

9
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,000
It's all over, they are gone. We'll be all right.
Look at me, look at Mamma.

10
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,500
They are gone, drink.
Please, drink.

11
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,000
- Mamma !
- Rosetta !

12
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,900
You see, Mamma was right, they are really gone.
Please don't cry, my darling.

13
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,600
We've got to close the shop
and get out of Rome. But don't cry.

14
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,600
It's all over. They're gone.

15
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,100
If I was a man, I would shoot them all!
They're dirty murderers!

16
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,000
- Want me to open up?
- Sure, sure!

17
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,700
- I can't. It's all out of shape.
- It's all over, Rosetta. You can thank the good Lord

18
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,700
Madonna, look at the smoke!
That's my house!

19
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,900
Arnaldo, what's happened?
They hit one of the houses down the street.

20
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,800
A lot of smoke from the Tiburtino!
Here the ledge over the door came down.

21
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,800
''His Imperial Majesty has arranged to give the governor
of Rome a relief fund of one million lire''

22
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
- Who, the Pope?
- Of course not.

23
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,900
''His Imperial Majesty arranged
to give the governor of Rome ...''

24
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,300
''.All the people Count Sforza
said yesterday in his timely speech

25
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,600
have welcomed with dignity and courage

26
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,800
the severe test to which
they have been submitted.

27
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,600
His Holiness, Pope Pius XII has sent
a telegram to President Roosevelt...''

28
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Giovanni, you've got to help me out.

29
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,000
- I want my daughter out of Rome.
- It's all right, sit down.

30
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,900
She has a weak heart,
I'm afraid she might have an attack.

31
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
- You'll go where?
- Away from Rome!

32
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,500
- Those lunatics will come again,
even the Pope they don't respect.

33
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,600
- Fine! Then the war will be over sooner, maybe.
- Oh, are you crazy or something? We'll all be killed!

34
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,400
- What's Mussolini doing?
- That's what I'd like to know, that madman!

35
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,800
- He's got to say something.
- You women will believe anything.

36
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,700
Before they came to bomb us,
we weren't doing so bad Business was good.

37
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,900
- Oh!  Sure, it was.
- I'll leave you the keys to the store.

38
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,200
You might look in now and then
and check the house, too.

39
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
- If you trust me...
- Sure.

40
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,900
We'll make up an inventory,
just between friends.

41
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,700
- Buonanni will buy the stuff that might go bad.
- I'm sorry you're going.

42
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,100
- Why don't you get away?
- What will I use for money, Cesira?

43
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,200
- It would only be for a few weeks,
no more. Isn't it? - Sure.

44
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
- Take this to Covelli. Come back in an hour.
- Why an hour? - An hour.

45
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,600
If something had happened to Rosetta
I would have murdered someone.

46
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,100
Who would you have murdered?

47
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,300
I'm wasting your time, Giovanni.

48
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,500
I'd do anything for you.

49
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,900
I know, you were a good
friend to my husband.

50
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,500
I wouldn’t get my finger out, for that bastard.

51
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,700
But then you're just as two faced as all the others!
Weren’t you like brothers?

52
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Come on, you were with him then.
Did you love him?

53
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
- I married him.
- But you didn't love him!

54
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
You make me sick.

55
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I'd like to see you living like I did, sleeping
in a shed! And we ate once a day, that's all.

56
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,800
So, I went with the first one that said "I will
bring you to Rome." I married Rome, not him.

57
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, how was it?
With an old man?

58
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,800
Don't make me think about it.

59
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
Come on, sit down.

60
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,100
He used to tell me about you, you know.

61
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,000
- What did he tell you?
- Everything.

62
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,900
- Really?
- Once when we were out fishing,

63
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,700
he told me how you were built. He bragged about it.
I felt like shoving him into the water!

64
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,200
He should have told you that for the
last two years I slept alone!

65
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
And with whom did you sleep?

66
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Your mind's a sewer! When you're raising
a daughter, you think about other things!

67
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Look... didn't you ever want to?

68
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
That's my affair.

69
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,800
What are you doing?

70
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
There's no business at this hour.

71
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
No one's likely to come in.

72
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
You can shut what you want, Giovanni.
You don't own me after all.

73
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
You like me a little bit, don't you?

74
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,000
- But think about your wife...
- My wife!

75
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,000
I hope a bomb falls on her,
then I can marry you.

76
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
No, don't, Giovanni.
Please, Giovanni.

77
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Oh, Giovanni, be good!

78
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,100
Ah !

79
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,000
- Did you hurt yourself?
- I could murder you!

80
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,800
- Where did I hurt you?
- Here...

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Here?

82
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Giovanni !

83
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,900
Giovanni, you must never let
my daughter know about this

84
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,000
- Or else I'll do something crazy.
- Sorry about it already?

85
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,700
You better understand that for me Nothing
at all happened. We are like we were before.

86
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
Go on. I'll see you tomorrow.

87
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,800
You think you can treat me like that? Nobody can
treat me like that! I'm nobody's property!

88
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Thanks a lot for the wine!

89
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,600
You'd better put a new lock
on the store right away.

90
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,200
- Don't worry. I said Gaetano.
- That's fine.

91
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,100
- If there's is anything new, I'll write you.
- I can't! I won't write you.

92
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,100
it takes me an hour to write one word!

93
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,000
- A postcard's all right...
- Maybe you could come see us some Sunday?

94
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,700
I already thought of that. Ciao !

95
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
Ciao.

96
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,600
Rosetta,

97
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,800
sit down.

98
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Listen, Mamma, don't they sing well?

99
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,900
Dirty...

100
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,800
- Who are you angry at, Signora?
- Everyone.  - I just hate one person...

101
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,600
- What are they singing about?
- As always, something sad.

102
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,300
It makes you feel so melancholy!

103
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,200
You know who has the right to be melancholy?
We Italians!

104
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,900
My daughter was so excited about living
that she didn't sleep last night.

105
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That pig!

106
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,700
- What is it? Where are we?
- Who knows?

107
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
- They bombed the rails ahead of us.
- Am I supposed to walk to Naples?

108
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,700
It will take for or five hours to repair it.

109
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,800
- Fuck!
- You should thank heaven the trains are running!

110
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,200
- I'm not thanking anybody, especially not heaven!
- That's your affair!

111
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Look, that's Mount Forcella.

112
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
- Where's Sant'Eufemia ?
-  It's over there. We'll walk, we'll get there sooner.

113
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,000
-  Can we get off the train?
- Sure, why not?

114
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,800
- We'll have to walk many miles. All right?
I like to walk, Mamma.

115
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
- Will you hand me down our stuff?
- All right, get off, Signora.

116
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh, the sack! Where is the sack?

117
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,400
[German accent] Signora, hold on !

118
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
- Thank you.
- Please.

119
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,000
When is this war going to end?

120
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,800
We'll get home for Christmas

121
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
Din-don ! Din-don !

122
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Bells, Christmas and this all will be over.

123
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,500
And who understands you?

124
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,500
- He says it will be over by Christmas.
- Damn it! Another six months? It's much too long.

125
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,500
- Tell that to them!
- It all will be over at Christmas.

126
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,600
Din-don ! Din-don !

127
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,800
Here's how you do it, Rosetta. Look.

128
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,400
Watch out!

129
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,800
You have to feel it sitting on the middle
of your head, Rosetta. Don't keep your neck so stiff.

130
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Easy, like this.

131
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
(CESIRA) I've lost the skill myself,
damn it!

132
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,900
Arrivederci !

133
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,800
- Arrivederci !
- Arrivederci !

134
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,600
- Those Germans aren't so bad after all.
- No, mamma.

135
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,300
What pretty creatures you are!
My sons' eyes are popping out of their heads.

136
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
Rosario, hurry up with that. When you're through
go to the house and get yourself some food

137
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,500
and for Luigino some slices of salami.

138
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,500
- What time can we leave tomorrow?
- Rosario, when do you think the pretty lady can leave?

139
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,300
- Whenever she wants. I've got the mule.
- I made you a good price.

140
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,200
- The room for the night was included.
- I didn't have any choice!

141
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,100
What? Why are you complaining? I didn't even
ask you for any money in advance.

142
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,400
- In this time, who knows? I don't know you, pretty lady.
- Don't worry, don't worry.

143
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,900
- You know what this is?
- Jesus, Joseph and Mary!

144
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,800
I never saw so much money before!
Rosario, the lady's a bank!

145
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,900
Here the Monkey arrive!

146
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,200
- What are you doing here, monkey?
- You know what we are doing here.

147
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,900
- Looking for bread? Some wine?
- You are trying to be clever. I am more clever

148
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,900
Where are your sons?

149
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,800
- In Albania ! They're fighting in the war. Every one
knows that. They're fighting for the King and Mussolini.

150
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,400
Of course. Look in there.

151
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,500
- Who's using this bicycle, Vincenzo ?
- My poor old husband doesn't have the strength anymore.

152
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,900
- I use it.
- Sure, why don't we have a race sometime?

153
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,200
- Who are they ? - People from Rome. They're spending the night
with me. They're on their way to Sant'Eufemia.

154
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,800
I gave them a bed. We're Christians...

155
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,200
You know that your sons are deserters.
And you know that if we catch them we have to shoot?

156
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,700
I say all deserters should be shot!

157
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,300
Here's the wine. Now, let's drink to my sons
Drink, monkey!

158
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,800
Give it to me.

159
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,500
What's new in Rome, Signora ?

160
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,100
- They are dropping bigger bombs every day!
- Wait a few more weeks, you'll see...

161
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,400
- We have decided to get it over with.
- Let's hope so.  - Stay here in Fondi, signora.

162
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
here you can eat. In Sant'Eufemia, they
won't even sell you flour.

163
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,900
- That's where I come from. They know me.
- We could put you up at headquarters.

164
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,500
- You and the girl could help us out.
- Especially in the kitchen.

165
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,600
What are you saying? I'm not servant.
Not just servant. To help the militia, it's an honor.

166
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,600
And you? You'd like it?

167
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,500
or would you rather go starve
with the goats?

168
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,100
- Keep that for your sister!
- Shut up. I'll tell you when to talk.

169
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,700
You tell who when to talk?

170
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,400
Keep your hands to yourself,
you miserable pig!

171
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
- Stay away from her, or I'll smash your face!
- They're respectable people. They're Fascists!

172
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,700
- This woman deserves to be shot.
- They're women, maybe you'd better leave them alone.

173
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,300
- Put that rock down.
- Do what he says! - Mamma !

174
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
We could force you to come to headquarters.
Make her understand.

175
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,100
I will talk her into it, Monkey.

176
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Rosetta. Rosetta.

177
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,100
- Let's go. It will be light any minute.
- I'm sleepy ! - Damn it!

178
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,200
Those men will come back today.
I didn't sleep all night.

179
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,800
Rosetta.

180
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,500
Mamma.

181
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
Oh, mamma mia !
Put this on. Quick, quick, quick!

182
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,600
I shouldn't have showed them all my money,
they all look like dirty thieves!

183
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,100
With this, we can go where we want.
Please, hurry, sweet angel, hurry!

184
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,000
- You've never ridden a mule, have you?
- Never, mamma.

185
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,200
When I was young I loved to ride them.
I used to hit them to make them go faster.

186
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Hey, where could we get two mules
to take us over to Sant'Eufemia ?

187
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,200
- I don't know. People doesn't move like before.
- I can pay.

188
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,900
- My daughter had enough walking.
- I'm from the next village, Forcella. I can't help you here.

189
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,700
- I bet you anything they're on her way to Rome again. Good bye.
- Good bye.

190
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,800
- You're not scared, are you?
- No, Mama, I'm not scared now.

191
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,300
That idiot tried to kill us!

192
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
- But why, Mama?
- Who knows!

193
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,100
Let's go. come on.

194
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,800
- We'd better go round this way... - The poor man...
- I know, but we couldn't help him, child.

195
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,400
- You are Paride.
- And you are Cesira.

196
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
- You still need a shave.
- We're not rich like you people in Rome.

197
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,800
This one made a fortune in Rome!
You recognize her?

198
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Luisa !

199
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,400
- With a son on the way!
- He gave me three already!

200
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,500
- Sit down, signora.
- Sit down, Cesira. - Thank you.

201
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,900
- Signora, this is my niece.
- Hello.

202
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,000
We're celebrating a miserable day,
my wedding anniversary!

203
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,900
Come here, Rosetta, come here!

204
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,400
She's my daughter. This air brings back memories.
like when my mother used to say

205
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,600
[She speaks dialect]

206
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,300
- Do you understand me?
- I don't.  - It means that a person doesn't stand still.

207
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,800
It means: ''Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
I'm carrying my heart in a quagmire''.

208
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,700
- Where is my aunt?
- In Naples with her daughter.

209
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
- Armando ?
- He's dead.

210
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,300
That's where I was born. It's rented, Signora.
I'm waiting for my relatives from Formia.

211
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,000
- Could you put us up for a month?
- I have no room with all this people who are since spring.

212
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I felt at first it was time to escape.

213
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,200
Paride, give them the weaving shed.
You can put the loom in your place.

214
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,200
- Paride, don't make me beg. Aren't we relatives?
- We're all relatives here.

215
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,000
- I'm not going back to Rome, nor to Fondi. This morning
we almost got ourselves killed.  - How?

216
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
- An airplane. It killed an old man.
- We're safe from that here.

217
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,400
- We pass the time among friends and we eat.
- The English will be here soon.

218
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
- English or German... who wins, wins.
- I'd wish they'd hurry! - Who doesn't?

219
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,300
If the Germans win, I will kill myself.

220
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
- What have they done to you anyway?
- To me personally, nothing.

221
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,600
- And then? - So, enough politics.
Eat some more. And you play!

222
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,600
- What would you like to hear? He used to have an orchestra in Fondi.
- Here he plays for nothing.

223
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,800
Play 'Vivere'' !

224
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,600
Living... without being jealous...

225
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,800
- Signora, you have a store? - And what a store!
- What kind? - A grocery.

226
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,900
Everything can change world, but not for someone
with a grocery store. Filippo De Libero, I have a store in Fondi.

227
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,200
- People will always need groceries.
- Unless the Russians come. - What do you mean?

228
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,900
The Russians don't believe in business.
Life without business is nothing.

229
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,300
- You accountants know anything!
- What does the Pope think, Signora?

230
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,200
He made a speech yesterday.
Everybody cried.

231
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,400
- Bombs killing women and children!
- Don't our bombs kill?

232
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,100
- You're the ones who wanted the war!
- Me ? - Yes, you, too.

233
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,800
- If I...
- You're wearing your Fascist pin.

234
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,900
- So what?
- I have one, too.  Does that mean I wanted the war? Play something!

235
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,200
- That won't change anything! The harm is done.
- You talk as if you weren't Italian.

236
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,600
I'm not, if it means stay here and stuffing my face
while the rest of the country is dying.

237
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,000
We're pigs. That's what we are!
All pigs!

238
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,000
Why do you always have to spoil everything, Michele?

239
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,400
- He's not a bad boy, signora.
- No, Signora, he's really very nice.

240
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,500
My son should thank God that I'm around to earn money!

241
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,700
- He's an idealist.
- That's it! - So everybody makes a fool of you.

242
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,000
Let's play ''Faccetta Nera'' [A Fascist song].

243
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,500
Maybe I could buy some food for you.

244
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Once there was enough of everything here.
Money was all you needed.

245
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,800
Not now.

246
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,600
You can buy me fifty sacks of flour...
twenty sacks of corn meal...

247
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,500
You want some split peas, beans, lentils?

248
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,300
- How are the prices?
- People around here are still honest.

249
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,400
A jar of lard and some olive oil.

250
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,400
- Who's got olive oil these days?
- I'll get her some, Mama.

251
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,200
Don't worry about them, Signora.
They come almost every night.

252
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,700
- Why didn't they wash before dinner?
- Ladies don't work on the land.

253
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,400
when I was young we were worse off than you are!

254
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,400
- Your land was poor. You sowed the field with wheat
and the priests took all the harvest. - You hear Rosetta?

255
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,200
Papa.

256
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,600
In a little sack there are 60 nuts.
Ten persons want an equal share.

257
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,400
Do I multiply or divide?

258
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,600
Why ask your father? You went to school,
you have to teach us.

259
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,600
Do you see this piece of bread?

260
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,300
If I want to give one piece to you and one piece
to me, what do I do?

261
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:55,400
- Stupid!
- Leave him alone! The school is closed, it is not his fault.

262
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,200
- Your uncle will teach you when he comes back.
- He can wait. Go to your mother.

263
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,900
- He'll never come back.
- Where is he?  - In Russia.

264
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,000
- Those Russian women, they only like foreign men.
- There are no men in Russia?

265
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Peppino will come back!

266
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,700
- He wants to be near his little girl
- He left her before she was born.

267
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,600
- You want some of these carots?
- We fed these to horses.  - War changes things.

268
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,600
Antonio, they're dropping the big lights!

269
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,600
The big lights! Look! There they are!
You see the big lights?

270
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,495
- How lovely, Mama, makes me feel like praying
- Then pray, my angel, pray.

271
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
I beg your pardon, I didn't want to offend you.

272
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,500
It would take more than that.
What are they doing with those lights?

273
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,800
- They are checking troop movements.
- Can they see us?  - Very clearly.

274
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,600
Isn't there some safe place in the world?

275
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,500
You can't escape. And it is better so.

276
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,300
You see everything so black!
What's on your conscience?

277
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,400
- Sins, like everybody?
- There are no sins on my conscience.

278
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,300
Well, you might count one... the day before yesterday.

279
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,300
- you see?
- It was not a sin for which I should die.

280
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,800
And where do the children come into it?

281
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,600
You're getting a real behind like a woman!
Signora !

282
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,400
Michele !

283
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,400
- Signora, I wanted to... I didn't know, I'm sorry.
- Dont' worry, she's only a little girl.

284
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,200
- I'm inviting you both for a walk.
- Dry yourself, dear.

285
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,000
- Ask the girl to excuse me.
- Forget about it, will you? Come back later.

286
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
No, mamma !

287
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,400
- Don't make such a face.
- I never want to see him again.

288
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,400
He couldn't have seen you.
The sun was in his eyes.

289
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,200
The boy's a bit mad. His father spent a fortune
to educate him and all he gets are insults.

290
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,500
- The things he said were true.
- What do you know about life?

291
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,600
If you talked to me the way he does
I would slap your face.

292
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,300
You should have seen him run!

293
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,400
We must be nice to him.

294
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,500
His father has hams, pasta, everything!

295
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm first, 'm first, I won!

296
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,900
- You're a real mountain goat! What's that book?
- History, I failed it.

297
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,100
- What school do you go to?
- The convent.

298
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,200
- In convents, you never learn
how things really are.   - Why?

299
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,200
Michele says it's wrong to send me to the convent.

300
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,100
There's such a thing as public school,
isn't there?

301
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,100
She goes to the best school in Rome.
It costs a fortune.

302
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,100
That's right, in Italy, the more money you have
the more you go with the priests and the nuns.

303
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,200
- Rosetta ! - Rosetta !
- Ah, you and your smart ideas!

304
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,800
I'm sorry but sometimes I have
to say what I think.

305
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,000
- Do you ever go to church?
- Me?    - Yes.

306
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,700
A few years ago, I wanted to become a priest.

307
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,100
- You wanted to become a priest?
- Yes, I did.

308
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,000
- Why didn't you go ahead and do it?
- I realized I didn't have the vocation.

309
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,100
Or rather that I did, which is why
I didn't become a priest.

310
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,200
- Rosetta !
- I don't want to come!

311
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,800
- Come on!
- You mustn't say things like that to her.

312
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Rosetta's a saint.  I'm not
even worthy to be her mother.

313
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,100
- No, you're something better than you think.
- What am I?

314
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,000
A shopkeeper.
But in spite of that, you're a good person.

315
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,700
- What's wrong with selling things?
- You're the same as before.  - What?

316
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,700
- a peasant.
- Thank you for the compliment.

317
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,000
- It is one, nowadays.
- What do you mean?

318
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,200
The uncivilized people are in the cities today.
They are the evil ones.

319
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,600
But peasants could begin again after the war.

320
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,299
What does that mean?

321
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,200
They are the ones who could build
something new,

322
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,000
but that won't happen while the others
control the government.

323
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm sure you're wrong, you'll never
change the peasants or cheat them.

324
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,900
I made a little money because
I am like them,

325
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,100
I never trust anybody.
A four-leaf clover!

326
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,900
It will bring you luck, here.

327
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,900
Damn it!

328
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,000
Damn it, I would give anything
to be in Rome right now!

329
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,900
Don't you even smoke?

330
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,300
No.

331
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,000
- You have a girl?
- No.

332
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,500
- What's the matter? Didn't you ever have one?
- No.

333
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:51,300
Today if a man can't sacrifice a little,
he's of no use to himself, his family or country.

334
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,700
Right, you can do without a lot of things
but not love.

335
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,800
- Ehi, little one, come here!
- Oh, what do they want?

336
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,900
- What do you want?
- Glad to see you again.

337
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,700
- I was asking were the shortcut to Sella is.
- Down there, straight ahead.

338
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,000
It's Filippo's son, the professor.
You remember, he's of the good ones.

339
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,100
In that case, he'll be glad to hear what happened.
Tell him.

340
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,100
I'd like to see his face when he hears it.
Tell him.

341
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,500
- We'd better go.
- Tell him, tell him!

342
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,200
- They have put the Duce in prison.
- What are you talking about?

343
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,800
They put Mussolini in jail, like a thief,
the one who made the Empire.

344
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And what will happen to Italy now?
Twenty years of glory ruined in a day, in an hour!

345
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,300
He was a fool, the Duce, for not
getting rid of you traitors at the start.

346
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,200
You don't need reason with traitors,
You use this!

347
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,000
Put that away, will you?
Let him alone, the Germans will get him. Let's go.

348
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,900
If it's really true, I will day happy.
Go ahead!

349
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,100
- No !
- Be quiet, Rose, he will not fire.

350
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,800
The Germans will show you
how they handle traitors!

351
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,300
They will make you lick dirt
with your tongue! Go on, eat dirt!

352
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,800
Let's go Secretary. And you thank God
we are kindhearted.  Secretary...

353
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,100
They are going, my daughter, look, you see.
Did you believe him Michele? It's like a comedy.

354
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,300
- It's true, they're running away.
- It's impossible! It can't be true.

355
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,600
But it's true. A new life is beginning.

356
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,400
- We can go back to Rome.
- Go wherever you like, we're free!

357
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I'm going back, I'm going to tell everybody!

358
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,400
You know something?
It's all crazy as hell.

359
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,400
Excuse me, Rosetta.

360
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,900
We'll, I'm glad that they've liberated Mussolini,
poor man. He has a wife and children, too.

361
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,000
Just between us, Mussolini, as a man, I mean...
what do you think of him?

362
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,100
- As a man ?
- He would scare me.

363
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,700
How can you make love with that man?
I'd freeze up.

364
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,800
all you have to do is switch off the light.

365
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,200
- What are you laughing at?
- Go and read your book.

366
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,700
- I want to know.
- We were talking politics.

367
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:45,200
- Signora, tell us what's so funny. - Aren't we playing cards?
One moment. Open up, there.

368
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
- I win!
- That's right.

369
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,100
Come in.

370
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,100
These two are English.
They need assistance.

371
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,200
Their submarine brought them
to Italy on a mission.

372
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,700
- This is no business of yours
- We could hide them for a few days, before they go to South.

373
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,900
- But the other people can protest.

374
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,900
- They don't protest, they shoot!
- Well?

375
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,100
You must explain to them
we have a duty toward our families.

376
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,400
There are many spies. If the Germans
found out, what a mess!

377
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,000
They'd take us all to Germany, Michele.

378
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,200
- Yes, we must think about our children.
- You don't have any.

379
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,200
- You can't always think about yourself.
- You're wearing your Fascist pin.

380
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,100
- This way.
- Michele.

381
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,800
- We could give them some bread.
- Isn't she stupid?

382
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,500
She wakes up hungry during the night,
yet she wants to give away food. Come on.

383
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,200
- They go right after, eh?
- I knew you were a decent person.

384
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,300
- Damn it, anyway.
- You should put something on it right away.

385
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
I'm used to it from slicing in the shop.

386
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Thank you. This wine should be good,
because it was given by someone good.

387
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,600
To the English.

388
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
To the other English.

389
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,000
To Michele.

390
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,300
A drop for Rosetta, and to me.

391
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,200
- To victory.
- To a new world.

392
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,500
Many of us hope that after the war
there'll be a great change.

393
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,000
It will change, but first I'm afraid
we'll have to beat the Germans.

394
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
It's very good.

395
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,300
- Viva Giovanni!
- Giovanni!

396
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,400
- Who's Giovanni ?
- A little more, mamma.

397
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,100
You want to get drunk?
My ears are hot already.

398
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,600
- There are lots of good things in Italy.
- You don't know Italy.

399
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,200
- Oh, we know Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo.
- They are dead.

400
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,000
You don't know the ones who are alive.
Look at those eyes.

401
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,500
Show the English your eyes, sweet angel.
They're like two stars.

402
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,300
- They're pretty.
- Beautiful.

403
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,000
Instead of landing your armies so far south
you should have landed much further up,

404
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,300
you would have bombed fewer cities.

405
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,100
And fewer children like this one
would have been killed.

406
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,400
Headquarters ordered it,
it had to have a reason.

407
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,100
Headquarters give orders,
but they haven't seen these eyes.

408
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,500
Why don't you ask him if the war
will be finished by spring?

409
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,900
They know less than we do.

410
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,500
well, thank you very much. We don't want
to abuse your hospitality.

411
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,600
Where are they going to sleep?
I've gone this far.

412
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,200
In the mountains, signora.
We're strong enough now.

413
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,000
There are caves up above
here in the mountains.

414
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,400
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

415
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,800
- Thank you, signora.
- Arrivederci.

416
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,900
- Arrivederci.
- Wait, I'll go see if it's all right.

417
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,900
Come on!

418
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,800
Put the things away. I'm going out
for a breath of air. Feel my forehead.

419
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,600
How warm you are, mamma !

420
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,200
- You just keep going straight ahead.
- Good bye. Thank you.

421
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,600
When I have a drink, it goes right to my head.

422
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,800
- Who is Giovanni ?  - Are you still asking me that?
Why do you want to know?

423
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,900
- No reason.
- He is a friend, one that I can trust.

424
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,600
- Do you love this Giovanni?
- Do you love...?

425
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,600
Why? Can't I love if I want?
A widow, she can't be loved?

426
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,500
He has a wife and two kids, anyway.

427
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Does it seem right to you that a person
has to stick to someone he doesn't love?

428
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,400
It's terrible to go to bed with someone
you don't like. every night, all your life...

429
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,700
Come on Rose, come on.

430
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,700
This horseman is a donkey.

431
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,400
- Good night Michele
- Good night

432
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,500
- At least, Michele !
- The mice don't  respect anything.

433
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,400
- They have gnawed off even the Bible.
- Put yourself in the middle.

434
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,500
We are not at church,
you wanted to read us a story.

435
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,800
MicheIe, read whatever you want.

436
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,800
Here you have beautiful stories,
even better than in the novels.

437
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,000
I read of when Jesus walks on the sea.
Better, the Lazarus' resurrection.

438
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,800
Mama, come here, don't stand up.

439
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,000
No, I have to prepare the grass for dinner.

440
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,300
- Who's that?
- He's the son of refugees just arrived. His mother is ill.

441
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,200
Now we have become like goats, eating grass.

442
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,800
- Please, read.
- Who has the flour, does not sell it. - Please, read.

443
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,600
The farmers buried it.

444
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,400
Impossibile to find the salt.

445
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:57,000
- We ought to help each others
- We are all Italians.  - Please read, MicheIe.

446
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,700
''A man named Lazarus

447
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:05,900
- at Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister were living...''
- Why have not you call me before?!

448
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,000
''Mary is that person who anointed the Lord's feet with perfume

449
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,900
and wiped them with her hair.

450
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,100
- It was her brother Lazarus that was ill.
- Amen.

451
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,000
'So the sisters sent him this message:
Please, Master, you dear friend is ill.

452
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,000
Jesus said: 'This illness will not result in death.

453
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,000
No, it is to promote the glory of God.
Through it, the Son of God is to be glorified..

454
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus...''

455
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,700
- Can you give me some bread?
- Be quiet.

456
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,200
''..he tarried, it is true, for two days in the place where he was.''

457
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,000
- AchiIIe! Did you buy some oil?
- No, they it was too expensive.

458
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,300
Stupid, it will become even more expensive.
You ought to buy!

459
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,600
A postcard for Serafino
and one mail for Cesira.

460
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,100
- Did you listened at radio?
- They failed to land because of a woman.

461
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,800
- But now they'll carry out the offensive.
- This time it's true.

462
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,200
- Signora Cesira, here we are!
- The Battista's son came back.

463
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,200
- We're going to talk later.
- See you...

464
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,800
MicheIe, let's go on.

465
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,700
''he remained for two days in the place where he was.
Then after this he said to his disciples:

466
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,300
"Let us go back to Judea."

467
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,500
The disciples said to him: "Rabbi, the Jews were just
trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?

468
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,600
Jesus answered,
"Are there not twelve hours in a day?

469
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,300
If one walks during the day, he does not stumble

470
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,800
because he sees the light of this world.
But if one walks at night...''

471
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,900
They tried to steal at home,
but Giovanni cheated them!

472
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,400
He's better than a brother!

473
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,600
They could to ruin me. The Rosetta's dowry
was in the wardrobe.

474
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,200
You are all dead,
more dead than Lazarus.

475
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,100
With your flour, with your thieves' scare,
your wealth walled up

476
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,200
not even Jesus Christ
could resuscitate you!

477
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,700
MicheIe !

478
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,600
- What's wrong?
- Nothing

479
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,600
Mama, was listening to him!

480
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,400
MicheIe's right.

481
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,800
Please stop! What's wrong?

482
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,300
- Nothing.
- You called us dead!

483
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:08,500
- We'll die by starvation for sure!
- Me too I'm dead.  - You, so young?

484
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,800
You have always to say what is in your heart,
right or wrong...

485
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:19,800
- I have not the nerve to talk aloud.
- You're even too much sincere.

486
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,800
- I am not sincere with you.
- With me?

487
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,300
Sure, with you.

488
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,700
Shoo! Even the goats!
I'll have to clean up everything here.

489
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,400
The gate is broken since I went away.

490
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,500
Let's go, it's raining.

491
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,400
I love you, Cesira.

492
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,200
- In such a trouble, do you mind to that?
- I have to tell you.

493
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,800
You could too give me a smack in the face,
but it's true.

494
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,200
These stupids are here to see the scene!

495
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,200
- Don't you mind to such a things?
- Me?

496
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,600
You mind, you mind. You have someone in your heart.

497
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,300
Only my daughter.

498
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,700
- I've decided to go back home, Rosetta.
- Se vuoi, mamma.

499
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,500
- They won't bomb Rome anymore. They'll start bombing here.
- True, mamma.

500
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,400
How skinny you got. You need more to eat.
We have plenty to eat, in Rome.

501
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,900
How cold she is!
Come here, Rosetta.

502
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,400
- Mama, why doesn't he come anymore, Michele?
- I don't know.

503
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,400
- He loves you, Michele.
- Go on.

504
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
I can see why, you're so beautiful.

505
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,900
He's 25 years old! Never go with a boy
younger than yourself.

506
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,400
- But he's the nicest man in Sant'Eufemia.
- Being a nice man these days isn't much help.

507
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,000
Damn draft!

508
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,700
- You know what I think Michele is? A subversive.
- What's that?

509
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,100
Someone with a good heart
who doesn't like work.

510
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,600
- We'd better give him back his book.
- But he gave it to me.  - He'd make a good husband.

511
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,400
He has no vices. If you were a few years older,
I'd let you marry him.

512
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,300
- What are you saying, mamma!
- You'll have to think about such things someday, no?

513
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,300
Listen to her laugh!
