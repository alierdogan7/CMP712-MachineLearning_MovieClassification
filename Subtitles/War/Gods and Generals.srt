This train was on its way to Washington.

186

There's enough damn beef in here

187

And as many steeds as would
damn well meet our current needs.

188

With your permission, sir, we've made
a selection of the more promising horses.

Mr. Harman, l fear you are a wicked man.

191

-This animal looks fit for the duty.
-Then he's yours, sir.

192
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,085
That small horse over there,
has he been assigned?

193
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:14,048
Well, it's a well-rounded sorrel, sir,
but too small for you.

194
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,258
You'll have your feet
dragging in the dust.

195

196
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,220
He would make a fine present for her.

197

HARMAN: Well, that it would, sir.
Shall l arrange for the purchase?

198
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,147

at my headquarters.

199

-Good morning, sir.
-Reverend Pendleton.

204

-How goes it with the artillery today?
-You're just in time for a christening.

205
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:58,634
The men have decided to name the
howitzers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

206
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:04,098
l'm sure your men will spread the gospel
wherever they encounter the enemy.

207
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,475
Has my son proven a worthy adjutant?

208
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,605
l'm certain Captain Pendleton will prove
himself deserving of the family name.

Break! Guard! Charge!

210
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,293

to stick a man with this.

You can give me your bayonet
if you have no further use for it.

You never heard of spare parts?

Pogue, your only hope is that some Yank
puts you out of your misery.

00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,398
How fare the scholars
of Washington College?

217
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,317
Are they making their transition
from books to bullets?

218
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,905
A few more days of drill, and my boys
will surpass the cadets of VMl .

Remember Alexander in Anatolia.

220

We march by day,
and read Xenophon by night.

222
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:18,213
-We will be your Greek phalanx.
-Then you must begin with the bayonet.

223
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,342
The bayonet must be for a Virginian
what the sarissa was for a Macedonian.

224
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,680
lf the Yankees dare set foot in Virginia,
we must show them the bayonet.

225
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,184
Train with the bayonet
and we shall keep our freedom.

your sorrel to Mrs. Jackson in Lexington.

229
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,457
The horse you chose
is waiting at headquarters.

230
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,543

this little sorrel for myself.

231

to that of the larger horse.

Unlike the other, he has an even temper.

He will need it where we are going.
Yes, l will keep it.

What should we send her, sir?

to make another selection.

My complete admiration in his choice
of livestock, if not in his choice of words.

We should meet the invader on
the verge of just defense...

the violators of our homes and firesides.

to face the reality of this coming war.

00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,236
My daddy said art
was the hardest thing.

498
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,989
That everything else seems
more important at the time. . .

499
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,534
. ..but that we needed it more than air.

500
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,369
More than food, even.

501
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,665
So now it's politics instead of hunting.

502
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,668
Same old thing.

503
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:49,631
Gotta stay concentrated
on what really matters.

00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,537
Gentlemen, new orders
from the War Department.

507
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:26,919
The Confederate Army's been reorganized
into three districts.

508
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,547
That of the Potomac will remain
under General Beauregard.

509
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,258
The Aquia under General Holmes.

510
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:39,264
Um, l've been promoted
to major general. . .

511
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,685
. ..commanding all forces in and around
the Shenandoah Valley.

512
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:49,149
The entire army together will now be known
as the Army of Northern Virginia.

513
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,779
Although l am being transferred
to Winchester...

514
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,449
. ..the brigade must remain here
at Centreville.

515
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,785
Begging your pardon, sir. ..

516
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,746
. ..but the men would prefer
remaining under your command.

517
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,790
That's right, sir.

518
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,126
Couldn't the entire brigade be transferred
with you to the Valley?

519
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:13,006
Gentlemen, such a degree
of public respect, confidence...

520
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:17,594
. ..as puts it in one's power to serve
his country must be accepted and prized.

521
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,805
But apart from that. . .

522
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,849
. ..promotion among men is only
a temptation and a trouble.

523
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:26,812
Had this not come to me as an order,
l should instantly have declined it. . .

524

of my brave old brigade.

525
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:34,945
Sir, may we hope. ..

526
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,449
. ..that a formal entreaty
to the authorities in Richmond. . .

527
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,744
. ..may effect a transfer
of the entire brigade to the Valley?

528

Hear, hear.

529
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,332
l'll not stop you
from making such a request.

530
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,169
But for now, we must prepare ourselves.

people in the war office in Washington.

1166
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:54,503
But to us, my goodness,
they're birthplaces and burial grounds.

1167
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,590
They're battlefields
where our ancestors fought...

1168
01:49:57,757 --> 01:50:01,302
. ..places where you and l learned
to walk, to talk and to pray.

1169
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:07,182
Places where we made friendships
and, oh, yes, fell in love.

1170
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:13,522
And they're the incarnation
of all our memories, Mr. Taylor. . .

1171
01:50:15,066 --> 01:50:17,610
. ..and all that we are.

1172
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:20,946
All that we are.

1173
01:50:53,563 --> 01:50:57,566
-What place is this?
-Chancellor's Crossing.

1174
01:50:57,734 --> 01:51:01,153
We're another two hours or so
from Fredericksburg.

1175
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:04,323
We'll rest here for a short time.

1176
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:07,910
Yes, sir. l'll see what
the good folks can provide.

1177
01:51:16,753 --> 01:51:20,506
The general be fixing to eat
something warm?

1178
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,424
No, no, Jim.

1179
01:51:22,592 --> 01:51:25,844
We gotta ride on straight
through to General Lee.

1180
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:29,014
Don't want to get all warmed up
just to feel the cold all over again.

1181
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:30,432
[CHUCKLES]

1182
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:34,019
You never seem to mind the cold much.

1183
01:51:34,187 --> 01:51:38,691
Oh. l minds it. l just don't shows it.

1184
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:43,779
Now, Little Sorrel,
l know this corn look poorly...

1185
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:47,616
. ..but it sure beats no corn at all.

1186
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:58,210
You heard from your family lately?

1187
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:02,381
Ain't heared much for some time.

1188
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:07,136
Yankee mail used to move
quicker than Secesh mail.

1189
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:16,729
Lord, from where you sit
you can see the great distance...

1190
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,315
. ..that separates our Southern men
from their wives and children.

1191
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:24,570
We pray that you watch over our families.

1192
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:29,241
Lord, l ask you to watch over
Jim Lewis' family...

1193
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:33,328
. ..over his friends, his loved ones,
wherever they may be.

1194
01:52:33,496 --> 01:52:38,083
Lord, l know you sees
into the hearts of all men...

1195
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:41,170
. ..just like you sees into the heart
of old Jim Lewis.

1196
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:48,677
And, Lord, l know there's
no lying or deceitfulness. . .

1197
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:50,846
. ..can hide from you.

1198
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:52,931
You find the truth. ..

1199
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:59,521
. ..in the bottom of the deepest pit
of darkness.

1200
01:52:59,689 --> 01:53:04,651
There be no hiding from your truth
and your ever-watchful eye.

1201
01:53:05,278 --> 01:53:07,112
Amen.

1202
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,864
How is it, Lord?

1203
01:53:09,949 --> 01:53:14,119
Can you explain something
to this old Virginia man?

1204
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:19,041
How is it a good Christian man. . .

1205
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:21,293
. ..like some folks l know...

1206
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:25,339
. ..can tolerate their black brothers
in bondage?

1207
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:30,052
How is it, Lord, they don't just...

1208
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,639
. ..break them chains?

1209
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:37,392
How is it, Lord?

1210
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:42,064
My heart is open and aching.

1211
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:44,024
And l wants to know.

1212
01:53:49,739 --> 01:53:51,824
Lord, speak to us.

1213
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:53,242
Speak to your children.

1214
01:53:53,409 --> 01:53:59,164
Speak to Jim Lewis and Thomas Jackson,
your humble and obedient servants.

1215
01:53:59,332 --> 01:54:01,917
Speak to all of us.

1216
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:05,170
Our hearts are open.

1217
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:08,257
Lord, you show us the way,
we will follow.

1218
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:18,934
Amen.

1219
01:54:25,692 --> 01:54:27,025
[SlGHS]

1220
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,948
-Jim?
-Yeah.

1221
01:54:34,784 --> 01:54:36,660
What is the status of your family?

1222
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:40,873
About half is free, half slave.

1223
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:44,877
That's counting all the cousins and such.

1224
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:48,714
You must know that there are
some officers in this Army. . .

1225
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:51,383
. ..who are of the opinion that...

1226
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:55,470
. ..we should be enlisting Negroes
as a condition for freedom.

1227
01:54:56,472 --> 01:54:58,849
That's what they says around the camp.

1228
01:54:59,017 --> 01:55:03,854
Your people will be free,
one way or another.

1229
01:55:04,022 --> 01:55:07,024
The question is,
if the Southern government will have. . .

1230
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:10,485
. ..the good sense to do it first and soon.

1231
01:55:10,653 --> 01:55:14,531
And in so doing seal a bond
of enduring friendship between us.

1232
01:55:17,493 --> 01:55:20,495
That's what they says, general.

1233
01:55:21,664 --> 01:55:25,000
God's plan is a great mystery.

1234
01:55:25,543 --> 01:55:28,670
lt will be revealed to us.

1235
01:55:37,722 --> 01:55:41,016
That's all the fodder you get tonight.

1236
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:45,354
We's going to a country where there's
nothing more for an animal to eat...

1237
01:55:45,521 --> 01:55:49,691
. ..than there is what's in the palm
of my hand. Ha, ha.

1238
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:04,581
General Lee, fine day, sir.

1239
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:08,752
We got batteries all along that hill,
covering our front to the river.

1240
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,420
Strong anchor on the north.

1241
01:56:10,588 --> 01:56:13,840
Tomorrow, guns will be positioned
in those trees to the south.

1242
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:18,053
We'll be able to cover the entire
open ground, all of it.

1243
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:22,766
General, they gonna come at us here?

1244
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:25,268
Colonel Alexander...

1245
01:56:25,436 --> 01:56:29,481
. ..Federal troops amassed across that river
are watching us prepare for them.

1246
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:32,317
lf l were General Burnside,
l wouldn't attack here.

1247
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:35,612
l'd move back upstream,
come across from above us.

1248
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:38,573
Burnside is not a man
with the luxury of flexibility.

1249
01:56:38,741 --> 01:56:42,119
He's being pushed from behind
by loud voices in Washington. . .

1250
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:45,747
. ..by newspapers
who demand quick action.

1251
01:56:45,915 --> 01:56:49,251
But we're here,
and so he will attack us here.

1252
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:52,004
We got batteries pointing from all angles.

1253
01:56:52,171 --> 01:56:54,673
They cross that canal,
that'll slow them down.

1254
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:57,426
We shall hit them from all sides.

1255
01:56:57,593 --> 01:57:00,470
No, sir, a chicken couldn't live
on that field.

1256
01:57:05,601 --> 01:57:07,227
General Lee, sir.

1257
01:57:07,437 --> 01:57:09,187
General Jackson sends his respects. . .

1258
01:57:09,355 --> 01:57:12,941
. ..and advises his corps will deploy
to the south of this position. . .

1259
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:14,901
. ..by tomorrow, as you instructed.

1260
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:18,113
Well, what are his men made of?

1261
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:20,240
He's 1 50 miles away.

1262
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:23,160
To General Jackson,
dawn begins the minute after midnight.

1263
01:57:25,788 --> 01:57:29,541
General Hood, l've often wondered
how it is that.. .

1264
01:57:29,709 --> 01:57:34,463
. ..Texas men, the most independent-minded
in this Army of irascibles. . .

1265
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:37,299
. ..have agreed to serve under
a Kentuckian.

1266
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:40,469
l have often wondered the same.

1267
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:46,808
General Gregg, have you settled your
differences with General Jackson?

1268
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:50,228
No, General Hill, l have not.

1269
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,898
Have you?

1270
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,735
No, sir.

1271
01:57:59,530 --> 01:58:01,573
JACKSON:
Tell me, general...

1272
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:06,244
. ..do you expect to live
until the end of this war?

1273
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:11,249
Oh. l do not know. . .

1274
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:15,087
. ..but l'm inclined to think l will.

1275
01:58:15,254 --> 01:58:17,631
l expect l will be wounded.

1276
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:21,259
And you, general?

1277
01:58:22,428 --> 01:58:26,681
l do not expect to live to see
the end of this war.

1278
01:58:27,433 --> 01:58:32,354
Nor can l say that without victory
l would desire to do so.

1279
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:40,028
-Get up.
-Get up.

1280
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:49,788
Sir?

1281
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:53,834
Yes, Mr. Pendleton, you may enter.

1282
01:58:54,001 --> 01:58:57,546
Forgive me, general.
There's a letter for you.

1283
01:58:57,713 --> 01:59:03,385
Courier was running a little slow today,
but l thought you'd want to see it.

1284
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:05,887
Yes, thank you.

1285
01:59:07,056 --> 01:59:09,474
Good night, sir.

1286
01:59:45,261 --> 01:59:47,012
ANNA:
My own dear father:

1287
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:52,350
As my mother's letter
has been cut short by my arrival...

1288
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:55,604
...l think it but justice
that I should continue it.

1289
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:59,608
l know that you are rejoiced
to hear of my coming.

1290
01:59:59,775 --> 02:00:04,029
And l hope that God has sent me
to radiate your pathway through life.

1291
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:08,116
l am a very tiny little thing.

1292
02:00:08,284 --> 02:00:10,535
l weigh only eight and a half pounds...

1293
02:00:10,703 --> 02:00:16,208
...and Aunt Harriet says l am
the express image of my darling papa.

1294
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:19,544
My mother is very comfortable
this morning.

1295
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:24,382
Your loving daughter.

1296
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,725
Thank you, Lord.

1297
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:36,478
Thank you.

1298
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:38,563
Thank you, thank you.

1299
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:42,567
They've occupied all the buildings
along the riverfront.

1300
02:00:42,735 --> 02:00:46,321
We will be lining up those pontoon
bridges through a hail of lead.

1301
02:00:46,822 --> 02:00:50,659
Once across, the Rebs are sure
to make us pay for every block.

1302
02:00:50,826 --> 02:00:54,329
Beyond the town is the canal
which cuts across this open field.. .

1303
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,833
. ..a field we'll have to cross to reach
their entrenchments on Marye's Heights. ..

1304
02:00:59,001 --> 02:01:02,671
. ..another difficult obstacle
in the face of artillery fire.

1305
02:01:02,838 --> 02:01:05,590
Down to our left we could burst through.. .

1306
02:01:05,758 --> 02:01:11,179
. ..turn Jackson's lines, push him back,
trap Longstreet on top of the hill.. .

1307
02:01:11,347 --> 02:01:12,973
. ..surround him.

1308
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:16,685
lt's possible.

1309
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:20,939
Turn Jackson's lines?

1310
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:24,442
No, general, we'll meet them head on.

1311
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:27,112
And it will be a bloody mess.

1312
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,197
We'll march up to that hill there. ..

1313
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:34,286
. ..and we'll eat their artillery fire
all the way across this field.

1314
02:01:41,794 --> 02:01:44,713
We'll be able to look
at ourselves and say:

1315
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,716
"We're good soldiers.
We did what we were told."

1316
02:01:47,883 --> 02:01:52,637
lf we're not successful, we can say it was
a good plan, but there were contingencies.

1317
02:01:52,805 --> 02:01:54,723
You can go back to your hometown...

1318
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:58,977
. ..and tell the families of your men
they died doing their duty.

1319
02:01:59,812 --> 02:02:03,315
The Rebs have fortified
the high ground up the river.

1320
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:07,736
And anyway, there are strong currents
and obstacles to a crossing there.

1321
02:02:07,903 --> 02:02:10,238
Below Fredericksburg,
the river is too wide.

1322
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:13,408
And our earliest forces are
clear down to Port Royal.

1323
02:02:13,826 --> 02:02:17,746
Fredericksburg is now
the only place we can cross.

1324
02:02:17,913 --> 02:02:23,501
lf Burnside doesn't cross here,
he might as well resign.

1325
02:02:25,963 --> 02:02:30,842
That wily gray fox has outmaneuvered
our command again.

1326
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:34,429
And there's going to be hell to pay.

1327
02:03:03,125 --> 02:03:04,501
MAN:
Hurry up! Let's go!

1328
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:08,630
BARKSDALE:

the way that l was going. ..

. ..gouts of blood,
which was not so before.

2176
03:39:09,845 --> 03:39:13,848
lt is the bloody business which informs
thus to mine eyes.

2183

. ..for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven...

2184

. ..or to hell.

2185
03:39:59,978 --> 03:40:02,438
Well, Mr. Booth, another triumph.

2186
03:40:03,273 --> 03:40:05,900
The president and Mrs. Lincoln
wish to see you.

[CHUCKLES]

2188
03:40:12,407 --> 03:40:14,617
You may tell that tyrant...

2189
03:40:15,994 --> 03:40:18,078
. ..that destroyer of civil liberties. . .

03:40:21,958 --> 03:40:23,459
. ..that l am indisposed. Huh?

2192
03:40:26,796 --> 03:40:29,965
Better still, tell him nothing.

2193
03:40:32,135 --> 03:40:34,470
Tell him l'd already gone.

2194
03:40:45,315 --> 03:40:46,815
Golly gee, Booth.

2195
03:40:48,068 --> 03:40:51,654
An endorsement from
the president of the United States.

2196
03:40:53,490 --> 03:40:55,699
Could be a big thing for your career.

2197
03:41:18,098 --> 03:41:19,765
LEE:
General, from what we've observed. . .

2198
03:41:19,933 --> 03:41:22,685
. ..Hooker has moved five corps,
maybe 70,000 men.

2199
03:41:22,852 --> 03:41:25,312
They're digging in around
Chancellor's mansion.

2200
03:41:25,480 --> 03:41:30,359
Sedgwick has another 40,000
spread out along the Stafford Heights. . .

2201
03:41:30,527 --> 03:41:34,822
. ..on the north bank of the Rappahannock
in front of General Early at Fredericksburg.

2202
03:41:34,990 --> 03:41:39,451
Now, there's possibly 30,000 more
back along the river north of here. . .

2203
03:41:39,619 --> 03:41:41,245
. ..that we've not yet located.

2204
03:41:42,497 --> 03:41:44,623
We're not in a position of strength here.

2205
03:41:44,791 --> 03:41:48,502
We owe a great deal to the unexplainable,
the mystery of General Hooker. . .

2206
03:41:48,670 --> 03:41:51,046
. ..who's allowed us to maneuver freely...

2207
03:41:51,214 --> 03:41:56,593
. ..between two parts of an army
that's more than twice our strength.

2208
03:41:57,178 --> 03:42:00,639
We do not yet understand his plan.

2209
03:42:00,807 --> 03:42:03,100
He may still plan a move
toward Gordonsville. . .

2210
03:42:03,268 --> 03:42:05,602
. ..move around below us,
cut us off from Richmond.

2211
03:42:05,895 --> 03:42:08,397
And there's still Sedgwick on the river.

2212
03:42:08,732 --> 03:42:13,110
Now Sedgwick shows no signs of moving,
but that could change.

2213
03:42:13,486 --> 03:42:15,237
They're anchored against the river. . .

2214
03:42:15,405 --> 03:42:18,741
. ..and their lines continue
down below Chancellorsville. . .

2215
03:42:18,908 --> 03:42:20,993
. ..then curves along here.

2216
03:42:21,202 --> 03:42:24,580
We've observed their lines curving out
in these open clearings. . .

2217
03:42:24,748 --> 03:42:27,750
. ..then extending on out to the west.

2218
03:42:27,917 --> 03:42:31,503
Then what, general?
Do you know where their right flank is?

2219
03:42:31,671 --> 03:42:35,007
JACKSON: No. Not yet.
LEE: We must know. We must know.

2220
03:42:35,175 --> 03:42:38,677
lf he marches in that direction,
he could threaten our flank.. .

2221
03:42:38,845 --> 03:42:43,182
. ..or be going toward Gordonsville
before we can react.

2222
03:42:46,644 --> 03:42:49,271
Out here, in the west,
along this turnpike, here...

2223
03:42:49,439 --> 03:42:54,151
. ..their right flank's in the air.
lt's the one place they're not digging in.

2224
03:42:54,319 --> 03:42:56,737
They're not expecting any pressure there.

2225
03:42:57,238 --> 03:43:01,658
-Who's on their flank?
-1 1 th Corps. Oliver Howard.

2226
03:43:01,826 --> 03:43:06,538
Mm-hm. Were there any roads
farther down below the turnpike?

2227
03:43:06,706 --> 03:43:09,500
Yes, sir. lndeed there are, good roads.

2228
03:43:09,667 --> 03:43:13,087
That's Catherine's Furnace here
and there's a road here.

2229
03:43:13,254 --> 03:43:16,507
-There's a road over this way.
-Then, we must hit them there.

2230
03:43:16,674 --> 03:43:19,968
Then attack the flank.
They will have nowhere to go.

2231
03:43:20,136 --> 03:43:23,889
They'll have to go back across the river
or we will destroy them.

2232
03:43:24,057 --> 03:43:27,643
We're too close to their lines.
They'll observe our movements.

2233
03:43:27,811 --> 03:43:30,145
There must be another road farther down.

2234
03:43:30,980 --> 03:43:33,148
Now, is there someone we know?

2235
03:43:33,316 --> 03:43:36,276
Someone we can trust who knows the area?

2236
03:43:36,694 --> 03:43:39,071
Captain Pendleton.
Find Reverend Lacy for me.

2237
03:43:39,239 --> 03:43:41,323
LACY:
l'm, uh, here, sir.

2238
03:43:41,491 --> 03:43:43,784
This is my chaplain,
the Reverend Tucker Lacy.

2239
03:43:43,952 --> 03:43:45,994
He has family in this area.

2241
03:43:49,332 --> 03:43:52,918
Reverend, it would be very helpful
if you could find us a safe route...

2242
03:43:53,086 --> 03:43:57,548
-. . .around the enemy.
-Well, sir, uh, there, l know a family.

2243
03:43:57,715 --> 03:44:02,261
The Wellfords. Uh, l suggest a visit to them.
We may find ourselves a guide.

2244
03:44:02,429 --> 03:44:06,974
Please go at once, Mr. Lacy. Find someone
who might show us how we might proceed.

2245
03:44:07,142 --> 03:44:08,851
Yes, sir.

2246
03:44:10,895 --> 03:44:15,691
Then it has been decided, general.
This mission will be yours.

2247
03:44:18,153 --> 03:44:20,612
l would not have it any other way.

2248
03:44:33,042 --> 03:44:35,377
Where is General Jackson, Jim?

2249
03:44:36,880 --> 03:44:39,339
He done gone to see his officers, sir.

2250
03:44:43,303 --> 03:44:48,557
How come that you know so much
about what the general is thinking, Jim?

2251
03:44:49,392 --> 03:44:50,851
None of us do.

2252
03:44:51,019 --> 03:44:54,354
The general never tells me nothing, sir.

2253
03:44:54,522 --> 03:44:57,608
But the way l knows is this:

2254
03:44:57,775 --> 03:45:01,445
The general say his prayers twice a day...

2255
03:45:01,613 --> 03:45:03,489
. ..morning and night.

2256
03:45:03,656 --> 03:45:08,243
But if he gets out of bed in the night
two or three times to pray...

2257
03:45:08,411 --> 03:45:11,163
. .. l just packs the haversack.

2258
03:45:11,331 --> 03:45:15,584
l know there's a move on hand
and hell to pay in the morning.

2259
03:45:15,793 --> 03:45:17,377
[LAUGH lNG]

2260
03:45:18,087 --> 03:45:20,255
"Hell to pay in the morning."

2261
03:45:20,798 --> 03:45:22,049
Very amusing.

2262
03:45:22,634 --> 03:45:24,593
-Amusing.
-Yeah.

2263
03:45:26,095 --> 03:45:27,429
Yeah.

2264
03:45:28,640 --> 03:45:30,098
Wait.

2265
03:45:34,103 --> 03:45:36,146
There is another road.

2266
03:45:39,442 --> 03:45:42,319
lt's a road that runs
well below the Federal lines.

2267
03:45:42,487 --> 03:45:45,656
The Wellford boy explained it to me.
He knows the route.

2268
03:45:45,990 --> 03:45:49,201
He will march with us to where
this road rejoins the turnpike. . .

2269
03:45:49,369 --> 03:45:51,995
. ..then we turn to the east
and attack their right flank.

2270
03:45:52,497 --> 03:45:56,959
lt is a greater distance, perhaps 1 2 or
1 3 miles, but the boys can do it.

2271
03:45:57,126 --> 03:45:58,502
They have never let us down.

2272
03:46:02,757 --> 03:46:04,466
Farewell, general.

03:46:05,426 --> 03:46:07,553

of Anderson and McLaws.

lf Hooker pushes out of his trenches.. .

2279
03:46:26,489 --> 03:46:30,158
. ..he could destroy not only the plan
but possibly the Army.

2280
03:46:30,952 --> 03:46:33,829
And there's still Sedgwick
along the river.

2281
03:46:33,997 --> 03:46:38,292
How long will he sit staring at Marye's Hill?
How long?

2282
03:46:42,130 --> 03:46:45,048
We've divided the Army before.

2283
03:46:46,551 --> 03:46:51,096
We must retain the advantage of
surprise, we must outflank the flankers.

2284
03:46:51,264 --> 03:46:54,683
We must beat them at their own game.

2285
03:46:57,145 --> 03:47:03,275
Take your entire corps,
General Jackson, and destroy the enemy.

We face again a mighty
foe, a vast host.

An enemy more than twice our number.

2306
03:48:58,391 --> 03:49:02,978
But you have taught us
to fear not, to trust in you.

2307
03:49:03,312 --> 03:49:08,316
When the Philistines came before them,
the people of lsrael feared Goliath.

2308
03:49:08,484 --> 03:49:10,318
Their Army was in terror.

2309

No one had the courage to stand
against the mighty warrior.

2310
03:49:14,615 --> 03:49:18,660
Then you brought forth David,
a mere boy.

2311
03:49:18,828 --> 03:49:21,788
And Saul armed David with his armor...

2312
03:49:21,956 --> 03:49:25,959
...and he put a helmet
of brass upon his head.

2313
03:49:26,127 --> 03:49:29,337
Also he armed him with a coat of mail.

2314
03:49:29,505 --> 03:49:35,761
And DaVid girded his sword upon
his armor and he assayed to go.

is Shakespeare.

Oh. Very much.

Mr. Booth, tell me something.

04:17:23,928 --> 04:17:28,682
Do you regard yourself as the hero
or the villain of Shakespeare's play?

Well, ha, ha. . . .

2508
04:17:33,771 --> 04:17:38,024

as a hero, Mrs. Chamberlain...

a simple soldier who only speaks one line.

Yes. lt's for the audience to decide
who is a hero and who is villain.

We merely play the parts allotted to us.

2512

How do you think of us,
Mrs. Chamberlain...

as heroes or villains?

2514

2516
04:18:03,384 --> 04:18:06,845
. ..you cannot be villains
in Shakespeare's eyes. . .

2517
04:18:07,013 --> 04:18:10,140
. ..though Dante makes you
the worst villains in the world. . .

"Once more into the breach!"

Oh, yes. Henry V.

2536

But he's chosen the right role
in the right play.

2539

He'll be applauded
long after we're forgotten.

2540
04:19:33,975 --> 04:19:38,478
All we can do, Harrison,
is like l said to Mrs. Chamberlain.

2541
04:19:38,646 --> 04:19:43,149
All we can do is play the roles
allotted to us.

2542
04:19:43,401 --> 04:19:47,487
Well, if a teacher of rhetoric can
become a soldier, so can an actor.
