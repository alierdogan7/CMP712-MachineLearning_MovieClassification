"fides" in Latin...

353
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,923
Father Crispin,
I'll take it from here.

354
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,680
FATHER CRISPIN: I understand.

355
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,406
Take a seat.

356
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,124
Why don't you show me
how you moved the bottle?

357
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,450
You want to see? Yes, I do.

358
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,080
(GRUNTING)

359
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,489
I guess that was stupid of me.

360
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,526
Why don't you try again?

361
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,850
(GRUNTING)

362
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,361
Again.

363
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,609
(GRUNTING)

364
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,609
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)

365
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,563
There, it moved.

366
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,811
No, you moved it.

367
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,168
Yes, because you
moved me to move it.

368
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,643
See, I moved it because you wanted
the bottle to move so much.

369
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,088
And that, you could say,
is how faith works.

370
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,491
At least some of the time.

371
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,251
And this is as much as I
need to move a mountain?

372
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,802
Well, in theory, yes.

373
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,487
But it's up to him.

374
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,641
He's the mover.

375
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,569
How could I get bigger faith?

376
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,962
The list, the ancient list.

377
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,651
For centuries, people believe
that if you do this list,

378
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,121
it'll make your faith powerful.

379
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,326
This is what you have to do.

380
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,805

381
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,404
"shelter the homeless,"

382
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,803
"visit those in prison,"

383
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,967
"clothe the naked."

384
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,361
Naked?

385
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,531
How is that supposed to...

386
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,126
"Visit the sick,"

387
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,526
"bury the dead."

388
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,561
Oh.

389
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,766
Just one more thing.

390
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,002
In order to make
this list work for you,

391
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,605
I'm gonna add
one essential item.

392
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,889
"Befriend Hashimoto"?

393
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,604
Are you crazy?

394
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,728
It's your choice, Pepper.

395
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,730
What does that Jap
have to do with anything?

396
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,166
Everything.

397
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,121
Your faith won't work
if you have

398
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,521
even the slightest
bit of hatred in you.

399
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,967
Fine.

400
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,687
I'll do it, if that's what it
takes to bring my dad back.

401
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,841
Come again?

402
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,246
Bring my dad back.

403
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,881
Yes, but only
if it's God's will.

404
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,244
Why wouldn't God
want to bring my dad back?

405
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,560
I don't know.

406
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,361
But if I get enough faith,
nothing's impossible, right?

407
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,401
Yeah.

408
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,446
What do you want?

409
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,962
I'm sorry about the other day.

410
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,608
So were you nice to him? Yeah.

411
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,887
How can anyone
be friends with a Jap?

412
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,881
Take him a gift,
as a peace offering.

413

Want a soda?

416
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,327
And all he did was
throw it in the trash.

417
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,086
Oh, I think you'll be okay.

418
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,450
Hang outwith him.

419
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,562
Hang out? Yup.

420
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,004
Just, uh, get to know him.

HASHIMOTO: Ollie, why are you
getting me involved in this?

422
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,081
I just don't see
how this helps anyone.

423
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,485
Yes, yes, he did.

424
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,444
But I don't even drink soda.

425
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,607
Jeez.

426
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,083
Just tell the kid to stop.

427

to you, nip.

from my list?

Father Oliver's ancient list.

Oh, golly.

463
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,610
You told the boy that
if he waves a magic wand,

00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,006
he can bring his father back.

465

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,205
Maybe.

Maybe not.

If it's God's will,
yes, he can do anything.

He could turn you into a
rabbit if he wanted to.
