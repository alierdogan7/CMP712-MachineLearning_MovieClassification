1
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,878
(Big Ben chimes)

2
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,749
Miss Paget, do you want to go back to Malaya?
After what happened there?

3
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,070
<i>It's because of what happened there</i>

4
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,312
What good will it do you?
Won't you be only torturing yourself?

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,556
No.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,478
Now I've come into this money,
I've thought of all the things I can do with it.

7
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,790
<i>There's only one thing I really want to do</i>

8
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,836
And I must do it.

9
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,356
I'm going back to the village in Malaya
where they took us in,

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,715
where we lived for three years of the war.

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,110
Those people risked everything they had
to protect us.

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,156
Now at last,

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,196
something I can do to pay them back.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,033
No need to go in person.
I could transmit a sum of money to them.

15
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,475
No, I don't want to do it like that.

16
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,277
I want to go back there myself and give them
the one thing I know they really need.

17
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,756
I want to go back to dig a well.

18
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,952
- Jean!
- Oh, Fatima!

19
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,395
Jean, you've come back to us at last.

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,956
It works!

21
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,998
Of course it works!
When I dig a well, it always works.

22
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,036
(Speaks Malay)

23
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,196
(Shouts of excitement)

24
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,596
(Laughter)

25
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,116
(Drum beats)

26
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,716
(Other instruments join in)

27
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,156
Jean.

28
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,596
The well-it's finished.

29
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,636
Yes, it's finished.

30
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,676
And now you will leave us again.

31
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,716
What will you do, Jean?

32
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,597
Oh...

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,636
I don't know.

34
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,676
Perhaps you will get married.

35
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,716
(Firmly) No.

36
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,836
No.

37
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,876
<i>(Thinks) No I shan't get married</i>

38
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,315
<i>I shall never get married not now</i>

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,473
<i>Not after all that's happened
since the day that changed my whole life</i>

40
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,915
<i>That day in Kuala Lumpur in 1942</i>

41
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,872
<i>And if the telephone hadn't rung
If only I hadn't stopped to pick it up</i>

42
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,918
Pay attention, everybody.
I've got something to say.

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,037
You've all been told what to do
in a state of emergency.

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,476
Well, this is it.
Get on the first train you can to Singapore.

45
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,189
When you get there, report to head office.
Passages have been arranged for England.

46
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,157
(Astonished murmurs)

47
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,597
Please be quiet. The Japanese
are at Tanjung Malim, 50 miles from here.

48
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,638
Special trains have been arranged
for evacuees, so get out quick.

49
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,950
That's all. Goodbye.

50
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,632
You too, Jean.
Just drop everything and get out.

51
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,235
What about Mrs Holland and the children?
I thought the car was in dock.

52
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,073
I'm going to get it.
Get on the first train you can.

53
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,593
Fight your way on if necessary.

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,148
See you in Singapore.
Good luck and goodbye.

55
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,196
Goodbye, Mr Holland.

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,948
(Rings)

57
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,589
- The phone.
- Don't bother about the phone now. Come on!

58
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,514
(Phone continues ringing)
I'll catch you up.

59
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,156
- Hello. Who's that?
- Oh, come on!

60
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,196
You go on. I won't be a minute.

61
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,430
<i>- Hello? 
- Oh, Mrs Holland. He's just gone.</i>

62
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,318
<i>I've been trying to get the office
for ten minutes Where is he? </i>

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,118
He's gone to get the car.

64
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,158
The servants have all gone
and I've got no help at all.

65
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,196
Jane, please go away.

66
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,317
- Mummy, the baby's crying!
- I know. Go and get your things.

67
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,436
I can't manage the children on my own,

68
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,476
and pack at the same time.

69
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,516
(Line goes dead)
What?

70
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,556
Hello?

71
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,596
Hello?

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,636
Hello?

73
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,676
(Car engine splutters)

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,676
Here, let me have a try.

75
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,716
(Engine fails to start)

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,356
Haven't you got a car I could hire?

77
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,396
All cars gone.

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,948
- Haven't you got anything at all?
- All gone.

79
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,476
(Aeroplane roars overhead)

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,556
I wish he'd come. I wish he'd come!

81
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,356
Can I take my rocking horse?

82
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,079
No, darling,
we can only take what we can carry.

83
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,038
- Take Bunty.
- No, I want my rocking horse.

84
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,196
<i>I don't want Bunty I want my rocking horse</i>

85
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,794
I'll put the baby's things in this suitcase here.

86
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,758
Jean, he couldn't be so long getting the car.

87
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,434
I expect it's difficult
getting repairs done today.

88
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,193
But he's been hours!
Something must have happened.

89
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,508
(Baby cries)

90
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,875
(Gunfire)

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,836
(Firing continues)

92
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,595
Did you hear that? It was guns.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,638
They must be blowing up the bridges.

94
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,032
(Car horn hoots)

95
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,796
Daddy!

96
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,836
Are you ready, darling?

97
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,876
What are you doing here, Jean?

98
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,190
I came to give your wife a hand, Mr Holland.

99
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,316
Now you're back, I can go and get the train.

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,675
You can't. There's no transport running.

101
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,070
- I'll get a lift somehow.
- No, you're in with us. All set, Eileen?

102
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,470
- I'll be ready in a minute.
- You are ready. Drop everything.

103
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,074
One suitcase each.

104
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,596
Come on, Jane.

105
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,636
- Quick, Jane.
- Come on.

106
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,276
(Engine splutters)

107
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,676
(Engine revives)

108
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,990
Phew!

109
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,991
(Engine rattles)

110
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,036
(Engine cuts out)

111
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,276
That blasted mechanic.

112
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,436
Shall I start it, Dad?

113
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,476
I'll give you the word.

114
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,754
Try her now.

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,116
(Engine splutters)

116
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,716
Try her again.

117
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,594
(Engine splutters)

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,474
(Distant gunfire)

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,516
(Firing continues)

120
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,670
Well, THAT'S not blowing up bridges.

121
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,591
You'd better get out.

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,636
Freddie, try her again.

123
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,676
(Engine splutters)

124
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,275
How far have we come?

125
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,954
- About 5 or 6 miles.
- But Panong's 50, isn't it?

126
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,996
Just about.

127
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,554
(Distant vehicle approaches)

128
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,150
In the ditch, quick! Come on, Freddie!

129
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,756
- Daddy...
- Ssh!

130
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,836
(Vehicle passes by)

131
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,876
(Vehicle stops nearby)

132
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,797
(Baby cries)

133
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
(Footsteps approach)

134
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,919
Stopped for a picnic?

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,718
Our car's broken down.

136
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,392
It's a fine time for that. Come on.

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,153
- We're making for Panong.
- You're in luck. Hop in.

138
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,071
Move up inside. There's five more to come.

139
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,390
There's my teacher, Miss Horsefall.

140
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,595
Hello, Freddie.

141
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,717
Come in, Mrs Holland.
Freddie, you'll find Timothy in there.

142
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,395
I'm sorry, sir, the Japs mustn't get your car.
I'll have to burn it.

143
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,436
Driver, pull up 50 yards.

144
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,278
I've got 35 for you, sir.

145
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,032
16 women, 12 men and 7 children.

146
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,953
35?
Well, shove 'em in the accounts office, please.

147
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,158
Driver, take them round the accounts office
and tell them not to wander about.

148
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,916
I can get them away in fishing boats.

149
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,958
What about the launch, the Osprey?
She's due back this evening.

150
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,032
She won't be back here, not now.
It's fishing boats or nothing.

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,036
That's the accounts office in there.

152
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,196
Dad, can we go in the garden, please?

153
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,955
You can play with the other children,
but don't make too much noise.

154
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,428
Jean, can I have something
to wipe his face?

155
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,317
- Pass me the suitcase.
- This one?

156
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,510
I suppose you haven't got such a thing
as a cigarette, have you?

157
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,513
Come on, Arthur.
Don't let everyone push you around.

158
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,118
I beg your pardon?

159
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,396
That is not a camp stool.

160
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,278
Old bag.

161
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,430
I wish I hadn't brought so many things.

162
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,034
You're lucky. I had to leave everything behind.

163
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,030
(Baby voice) Where's your papa, then?

164
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,076
(She makes soothing noises)

165
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,916
Miss Horsefall, excuse me,

166
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,956
but, you see, I'm a sick woman.

167
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,395
I'm sorry, Mrs Frith. I'll come back later.

168
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,958
Yeah!

169
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,598
(Freddie makes gunfire noises)

170
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,636
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

171
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,470
Well, that's that. The fishing boats
have put to sea. No boats.

172
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,118
(Telephone rings)

173
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,475
DO's office. Who? The lighthouse keeper?

174
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,118
Yes, he's here.

175
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,758
For you, sir.

176
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,989
Hello?

177
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,517
<i>- The Osprey's just passed the lighthouse
- Thank you, Johnson. That's fine.</i>

178
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,910
They've sent the Osprey back.
It's just passed the lighthouse.

179
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,036
- Get your party ready.
- Right, sir.

180

181
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,916
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

All right, get ready, please.

183
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,038
The launch is coming back, and we can get you
to Singapore. Be as quick as you can.

184
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,798
I'll take these for you.

Men stand against the wall,

202
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,390
with hands raised like that.

203

There. There.

204
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,716
Women stand in line, facing men.

205
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,756
Come on, hurry up.

206
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,910
We take all money, watches, jewellery...

207
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,592

All turn round now.

214
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,996
You are prisoners now.

215
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,274
You do good things,
you get good from Japanese.

216
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,635
You do bad things, you get shot very quick.

217
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,676
So do good things always, please.

218
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,516
Men must go to prison camp now.

219
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,636
<i>Women and children stay here</i>

220
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,029
You say goodbye now.

221
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,789
<i>Please what will happen
to the women and children? </i>

222
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,070
Imperial Japanese soldiers
always kind to women and children.

223
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,549
<i>You say farewell now</i>

224

You will send me a postcard, won't you?

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,116
Hurry, please.

235
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,636
Goodbye, you old stick-in-the-mud.

236
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,032
Don't let them take you.
Please don't let them take you!

You come now very quick!

When Japanese officer comes, all bow.

250
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,598
Ladies.

251
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,272
Order has come.

252
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,276
You go back Kuala Lumpur.

253
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,032
Train to Singapore, perhaps.

254
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,839
Prisoners camp there for women and children.

255
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,150
<i>- You will be very happy
- Back to Kuala Lumpur?</i>

256
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,798
Yes.

257
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,836
You start now.

258
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,316
Captain!

259
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,553
You speak to Japanese officer,
you bow always.

260
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,710
- Captain, may I speak, please?
- Yes.

261
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,552
Where is the truck?

262
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,676
The truck.

263
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,796
Truck for women?

264
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,836
No, you walk.

265
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,480
Walk? But it's 50 miles.

266
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,074
- You go one bit each day.
- Impossible!

267
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,718
<i>We can't walk in this heat</i>

268
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,951
English women have grand thoughts always.

269
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,917
Japanese women not mind walk.

270
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,912
- Now YOU walk.
- We're not Japanese women!

271
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,956
No.

272
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,676
You are the arrogant English.

273
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,796
You will apologise and bow.

274
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,276
Apologise, I say.

275
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,198
- Apologise!
- No! Don't... shoot!

276
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,316
It is hard to be prisoner.

277
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,556
We will try to do good things.

278
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,432
Very good thoughts.

<i>In line please</i>

281
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,635
Kowtowing to a Jap! Disgusting!

282
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,631
No, she's quite right.

283
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,676
We ARE prisoners.

284
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
They can shoot us if they want to.

285
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,278
They can shoot me if I ever kowtow to a Jap.

286
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,078
You march now.

287
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,718

OK!

Are you all right, Mum?

296
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,949
Yes, dear, I'm all right.

297
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,798
Quinine.

298
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,836
<i>Who's got some quinine? </i>

299
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,358
Here.

300
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,036
Thank you.

301
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,598
Jean, damp this for me.

302
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,989
Tell Mrs Knowles not to drink that water.

303
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,152
I shouldn't drink that water
if I were you, Mrs Knowles.

304
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,470
We'll get some fresh in the next village.

305
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,193
Go, go!

306
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,633

311
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,189
We can't take all this stuff. Shall I just take
enough for the baby and Freddie and Jane?

312
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,236
<i>How far have we come? </i>

313
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,959
We're doing fine. A good seven miles.

314
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,871
But it's 40 miles to Kuala Lumpur.

315
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,916
40 miles!

How lucky you are not to have to bother
with silly medicines.

327
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,558
And now this one.

328
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,596
No, that's for after meals.

329
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,319
Oh, this is to stimulate my appetite.

330
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,437
I'll take this for the children

Jean... do something for me.

332
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,232
Speak to Mrs Frith.
She mustn't get away with it.

333
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,194
I know what you want, but I'm a sick woman.
I'm under doctor's orders.

334
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,635
It's a miracle I've got as far as this.

335
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,315
Come on, Mrs Frith,
we must share our medicines.

336
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,996
You can keep your special ones.

337
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,038
- I'll just take the quinine and the codeine.
- May God forgive you.

338
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,678
You'll be all right.

339
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,716
You'll be sorry when I'm dead.

340
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,916
Timothy.

341
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,592
Come here.

342
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,671
You can look after poor Timothy.

343
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,716
Well, I'd like to...

344
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,712
I'm so sorry, I simply haven't the strength.

345
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,595
You can look after each other.

346
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,116
Why you not march?

347
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,957
Very bad thing.

348
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,635
Can we please have a truck to Kuala Lumpur?

349
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,756
You not go Kuala Lumpur. No railroad.

350
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,717
British destroy bridges.

351
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,030
You go Port Swettenham. That way.

352
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,756
Then ship take you Singapore.

353
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,070
But it's nearly 50 miles to Port Swettenham!

354
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,076
How are we going to get there?

355
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,478
- Walk?
- Yes, walk.

356
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,233
One bit each day. You get there very quick.

357
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,276
Then ship to Singapore.

358
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,836

Jean...

362
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,836
Let me see him.

363
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,676
Robin's really taken to you.

364
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,357
Poor boy.

365
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,396
<i>I had such a bad time with him</i>

366
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,351

367
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,958

Jane...

370
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,437
They're in God's hands now.

371
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,636
And yours.

372
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,630
Why don't you eat your supper, Freddie?

373
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,078

375
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,238
Very sorry.

376
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,276
No good.

377
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,916
You can have these, too.

378
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,558
You have money?

379
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,437
- No.
- Cigarettes?

380
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,272
- No.
- Anything else?

381
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,276
Nothing.

382
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,920
I must have some milk for the baby.

383
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,230
Tinned milk or powdered milk, anything.

384
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,550
English food all finished.

385
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,110
Well... haven't you any
tins of soup or vegetables?

386
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,156

Ben, get those ruddy Nips
to get those women out of the way.

416
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,713
- I can't ruddy well see what I'm doing.
- Are we in the way?

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,998

But YOU'RE English!

424
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,438
No fear! We're Australians. We're driving
this thing for the Japs up to Port Swettenham.

425
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,750
G'day. How are you?

426
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,070
JEAN: We're walking to Port Swettenham.

427
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,718
You're walking? Where from?

428
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,109
- From Kuala Panong.
- Did you hear that, Ben?

429
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,193
That's a pretty rough deal. How do you get on
for tuck if you haven't got a camp?

430
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,317
- We get a pint of fish stew a day.
- And we beg from the Malays.

431
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,958
They give us food if they've got some.

432
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,712
What happens when you're sick?

433
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,268
We get well or we die.
We've run out of medicine.

434
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,796
If you had such a thing as a cigarette,
I'd throw my arms about you.

435
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,711
I'll settle for that. Here we are.

436
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,438
Thank you.

437
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,392

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,517
Hello, Colonel.

439
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,158
Thanks, Ben.

440
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,151
You're pretty quick on the uptake.

441
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,475
She's quick on anything.

442
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,597
- I'm sorry, I haven't got a cigarette.
- That's all right.

443
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,353
- I'll get one tonight.
- Are you staying here tonight?

444
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,396

Hey...

451
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,677
What medicines do you want?

452
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,117
Quinine. Something for skin troubles,
dysentery. Anything at all.

453
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,031
- Got any money?
- No, we haven't.

454
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,997
Well, I'll fix something.

455
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,153
I didn't think the first time
I talked to an English lady she'd look like you.

456
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,595
You're quite an oil painting yourself.

457

<i>GUARD: Do you hear what I say? </i>

458
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,676

459
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,398
How do we fix a breakdown, Ben?

460
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,038
Take a dekko at the hub,

461
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,079
pull out the half-shaft from the differential,
strip the crown and pinion,

462
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,197
- Throw away the carburettor...
- Throw away the truck.

463
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,511
How are you going to get medicine
if you haven't any money?

464
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,670
The old truck looks pretty bad to me!

465
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,716
Yeah. It looks pretty crook!

466
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,832

472
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,799
Do you want some petrol?

473
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,118
- Petrol.
- OK.

474
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,839
Two. You give me some quinine.

475

Here's some quinine.

483

This is the stuff the Chinese take for dysentery.

484
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,753
It's written in Chinese,
but take three of these leaves every four hours.

485
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,308
I've got some Zam-Buck for the skin diseases.

486
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,154
- I can never pay you for all this.
- The Japs paid, though they don't know it.

487
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,276
- Joe Harman.
- My name is Jean Paget.

- Good day. Thank you.

Don't go.

490
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,276
What about the guards?

491
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,112
I'll watch 'em from here.

492
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,276

No, I don't come from Sydney.
I work in the Northern Territory.

501
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,353
A place called Willstown,
to the east of the Alice.

502
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,998
I'm a stockman.

503
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,638
Alice?

504
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,278
Yeah, Alice Springs.

505
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,636
It's a town dead in the centre
between Darwin and Adelaide.

506
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,393
I thought the middle of Australia
was all desert.

507
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,038
My word, no.

508
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,079
No, the Alice is beaut. You get three meals
a day there every day. You'd like it.

509
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,718
Would I.

510
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,756
But your place, is it a sheep farm?

511
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,592
No, it's too hot for sheep.

512
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,432
Cattle. About 18,000 head.

513
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,078
It sounds a big place.

514
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,718
Mm. 2,700.

515
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,358
Acres?

516
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,998
No, square miles.

517
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,310
- On one farm?
- Well, station, you know.

518
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,675
Well, how many men do you take to run it?

519
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,194
Well, about three, and about nine boongs.

520
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,838
What is this boong?

521
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,515
It's an Aussie word, boong.
It means gippo, Abo, black fellow.

522
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,071
You can't get white fellows to work there.
It's about 60 miles to the nearest homestead.

523
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,720
- It must be lonely.
- Yes, it is...

524
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,552
...for women.

525
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,036
I suppose you've got to be born to it.

526
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,232
But you'd like the Alice.

527
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,276
It's beaut there. It's...

528
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,518
Well, the... country's all red
and the... mountains are red.

529
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,358
And... in the evening, sometimes,
it all goes kind of purple.

530
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,436
Of course, after the wet, it's green.

531
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,272
It's all right.

532
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,434
I suppose everybody likes their own place,
and the Alice is my place.

533
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,916
Where does he come from, this Joe?

534
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,517
He talked about... a town called Alice.

535
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,792
He made it sound...

536
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,236
...all right.

537
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,472
<i>No ship for you here! 
You go Port Dickson that way</i>

538
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,276
(Thunder crashes)

539
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,035
<i>So sorry No food for persons here</i>

540
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,917
<i>You must go Tampin That way.</i>

541
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,238
(Officers shout in Japanese)

542
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,236
We've got one of these at home.

543
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,878
So have we.

544
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,518
So have we, too.

545
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,798
I found it first!

546
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,075
My dear, I'd already seen it from the corridor.

547
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,196
<i>I got here first and I'm staying here</i>

548
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,838
<i>I'm tired and I'm fed up</i>

549
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,354
<i>MRS DUDLEY FROST: We're all tired</i>

550
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,396
In any case, I'm older.

551
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,436
I wouldn't dispute THAT.

552
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,278
Oh, one of these days!

553
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,918
<i>What is it? </i>

554
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,956
Nothing.

555
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,756
I was just wondering
just how long one can go on, that's all.

556
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,358
<i>EBBEY: Quick quick! </i>

557
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,116
<i>Down the corridor! Come on hurry! 
You'll never believe it! It works! </i>

558
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,156
<i>It's working Come on! </i>

559
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,798
<i>It's working Come on! </i>

560
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,836
<i>Hurry hurry! </i>

561
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,836
I just turned on the tap and it worked.

562
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,876
(Squeals of delight)

563
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,751
Now we can have a bath, girls!

564
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,475
(Laughter)

565
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,118
(Baby cries)

566
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,552
Thank you.

567
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,911
Soap, please.

568
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,231
Now, darling, don't cry. Come on.

569
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,993
There we are. Come on, lie down.

570
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,719
Lie down. There's a good boy.
I'll be back in a minute.

571
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,598
Stop it, Timothy. Stop it!

572
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,596
Wait for me! Wait for me! I'm coming!

573
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,756
(Groans)

574
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,676
(Makes aeroplane noise)

575
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,271
Look, Marzy. Bananas.

576
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,311
(Makes aeroplane noise)

577
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,438
(Speaks Japanese)

578
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,478
(Bird screeches)

579
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,516
<i>FREDDIE: Gunso! </i>

580
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,716
<i>Gunso! </i>

581
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,400
(Distressed cries)

582
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,478
(Mumbles) Mummy...

583
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,198
Mummy... Mummy...

584
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,876
Freddie, what is it? What's happened?

585
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,518
Freddie, what is it?

586
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,238
What is it? What's the matter?

587
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,788
- (Speaks Japanese)
- What's that?

588
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,438
(Speaks Japanese)

589
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,670
I can't understand! Freddie, what is it?

590
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,318
(Speaks Japanese)

591
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,958
<i>MISS HORSEFALL: Snake! </i>

592
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,996
Yeah, snake.

593
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,318
(Sobs)

594
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,152
Come along, dear.

595
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,992
We'll go for a walk.

596
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,116
Freddie?

597
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,836
Freddie!

598
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,076
(Sobs)

599
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,315
I'm sorry, I can't have you here.

600
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,278
I have no facilities for women prisoners.

601
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,918
No rations.

602
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,039
Tonight you will stay in school.
Tomorrow you must go elsewhere.

603
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,632
What's going to become of us?

604
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,278
You've got to understand.

605
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:05,229
We've been walking for four months.
Four months, this way and that way.

606
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,551
Nobody taking any responsibility for us.
Nobody caring.

607
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,596
Four of us have died already.

608
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,272
Now this little boy.

609
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,754
We must get to Singapore, or we shall all die.

610
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,478
Haven't you any ships?

611
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,118
Yes, we have ships.

612
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,031
For Singapore?

613
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,953
Well, the ships go to Singapore, yes.

614
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,996
Thank God.

615
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,230
When can you send us?

616
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,276
Tomorrow?

617
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,192
Can we go tomorrow?

618
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,316
You stay tonight in the schoolhouse.

619
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,118
Tomorrow we see.

620
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,074
You come here.

621
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,389
No, you.

622
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,752
You got very nice baby.

623
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,796
He's not mine. His mother's dead.

624
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,836
I'm taking him to Singapore.

625
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,356
I have order.
No more prisoners to go to Singapore.

626
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,192
Strict order. Very sorry.

627
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,952
What can we do? Can we stay here?

628
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,598
You stay tonight, yes.

629
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,238
But no longer?

630
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,436
Sorry, Malay children need this school.

631
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,272
Can we build our own camp?
We won't ask you for anything.

632
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,918
Except food.

633
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,752
No food here for prisoners.

634
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,796
No, you go to prison camp.

635
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,156
You go to prison camp at Kuantan.

636
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,718
Kuant...

637
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,756
But that's on the east coast.

638
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,150
That's on the other side of Malaya.
Nearly 200 miles!

639
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,958
OK, 200 miles.

640
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,998
But how do we get there? By rail, by truck?

641
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,911
<i>MISS HORSEFALL: Walk? Is that it? </i>

642
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,433
<i>We walk! </i>

643
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,476
Women and children, 200 miles.

644
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,516
We walk until the rest of us die.

645
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,955
That's what you want, isn't it?

646
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,510
<i>Why don't you have the courage
to shoot us all? Go on shoot us! </i>

647
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,795
Go on, shoot us! Women and babies!

648
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,950
<i>Shoot! Shoot! </i>

649
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,792
- Shoot!
- No.

650
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,672
All right, Captain.

651
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,030
We will walk to Kuantan.

652
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,076
Come here! Come here, please.

653
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,632
200 miles.

654
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,915
Yes, that is very far with a baby.

655
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,638
I make other arrangement.

656
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,358
You could send us by truck?

657
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,398
No, you stay here. I make good arrangement.

658
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,710
You stay good house, English house.

659
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,438
All of us, you mean?

660
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,078
Others walk Kuantan.

661
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,116
<i>You stay</i>

662
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,156
<i>You keep baby if you want</i>

663
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,309
Japanese soldiers very kind to women.

664
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,356
You will be very happy.

665
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,232
Come back! Come back!

666
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,556
You, come here.

667
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,632
Kuantan...

668
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,472
that's 200 miles.

669
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,516
We'll never get over the mountains.

670
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,352
Oh, yes, we will.

671
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,196
(Car engine starts)

672
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,952
(Speaks Japanese)

673
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,952
(Engine revs)

674
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,718
I think it's the carb.

675
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,552
BEN: Yeah, it must be.

676
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,876
Thank you.

677
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,678
Jean!

678
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,318
Jean!

679
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,356
<i>Jean! </i>

680
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,910
Jean, where have you been? I thought
you were going to Port Swettenham.

681
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,558
<i>Where have you been? </i>

682
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,108
Joe, they keep moving us on,
they won't let us stop.

683
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,430
They say there's no camp for us anywhere.

684
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,397
(Shouts in Japanese)

685
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,790
- Joe, go back.
- (Shouts in Japanese)

686
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,509
- Can I get anything for you? For the kids?
- Joe, go back!

687
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,158
BEN: They mean business.

688
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,152
We'll be all right. Please go, you'll be killed!

689
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,193
Where are you bound for?

690
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,350
- Kuantan.
- Our camp's at Kuantan!

691
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,398
We're up and down that road every week!
I'll find you!

692
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,755
(Guards shout)

693
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,278
I... can't...

694
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,918
I... can't...

695
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,558
Ebbey!

696
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,596
Gunso.

697
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,032
Come along, dear.

698
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,678
Come along.

699
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,716
- I can't.
- Try.

700
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,756
Try.

701
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,078
Come along.

702
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,348
Jean, you've been giving Jane quinine.

703
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,112
I want some for Brenda.

704
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,836
You know there's been none for a week.

705
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,273
I saw you giving it to her!

706
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,992
<i>Does she look like it? </i>

707
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,955
We must go on.
We must get out of the swamps.

708
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,751
How is she, Mrs Frost?

709
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,632
She can't go any further.

710
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,112
We'll rest here till daylight.

711
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,037
There, darling. Have a little rest.

712
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,076
Isn't there any drinking water?

713
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,116
Not till we boil some.

714
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,838
Jean.

715
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,912

717
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,718
MRS RHODES:
* There's a friend for little children

718
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,839
* Above the bright blue sky

719
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,879
* A friend who never changes

720
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,316
* Whose love will never die

721
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,075
* Our earthly friends may fail us

722
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,630
* And change with changing years

723
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,554
* This friend is always worthy

724
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,235
* Of that dear name he bears

725
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,992
Hey, look!

726
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,832
Look.

727
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,672
It's them!

728
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,912
How many?

729
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,956
One, two...

730
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,792
three, four, five, six...

731
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,711
BEN: There she is, the one with the baby.

732
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,112
(Horn beeps)

733
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,276
OK for Operation Breakdown?

734
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,956
Yeah.

735
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,318
"Dear Mrs Boong..."

736
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,992
Who's Mrs Boong?

737
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,672
(Distant horn beeps)

738
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,278
What's it like?

739
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,918
- What, Southampton?
- Yeah.

740
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,752
Oh, docks and ships.

741
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,751
The countryside's green and cool.

742
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,756
I've had enough of heat and sun and fever.

743
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,398
You're not kidding!

744
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,040
There's an ice rink there. I used to skate a lot.

745
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,553
I could waltz.

746
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,119
What, on ice?

747
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,758
I'd like to have seen that.

748
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,070
What did you do in Kuala Lumpur?

749
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,310
Oh, just a secretary. Nothing special.

750
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,358
Look...

751
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,510
Your feed tomorrow, what will you get?

752
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,632
We may be lucky tomorrow.

753
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,280
We'll be all right when we get to Kuantan,

754
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,918
to a real prison camp.

755
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,878
- In Kuantan?
- Yes, there's one there, isn't there?

756
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,518
Sure... yes.

757
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,955
I wouldn't know. Yeah, you'll be all right there.

758
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,919
I can get a couple of chickens and
drop 'em off when we come back upcountry.

759
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,956
Joe, I wouldn't like you to do that.

760
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,589
You attend to your business, Mrs Boong,
and I'll attend to mine.

761
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,070
Take everything you can get.
The prisoner's motto... and mine.

762
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,116
Please don't take risks for us.

763
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,239
Anybody can run rings round the Japs,
as long as you know how to scrounge.

764
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,158
<i>All clear? </i>

765
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,196
Just a minute.

766
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,791
OK.

767
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,398
One other thing.

768
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,232
Mr Boong, did he get away?

769
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,232
There's no Mr Boong, Joe.

770
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,036
Here.

771
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,672
Thanks, mate.

772
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,031
* Wrap me up with my stockwhip and blanket

773
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,998
* And bury me deep down below

774
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,550
* Where the dingoes and crows
can't molest me

775
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,712
* Way down where the coolabahs grow

776

* Dinky di

777
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,270

For once I agree with him. Take it easy!

782
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,398
OK, sweetie.

783
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,357
That goes for you too, Colonel.

784
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,636
All right, then. How do we celebrate?

785
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,676
Feed 'em chicken and champagne?

786
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,433
- Just chicken.
- Just chicken... Just chicken?!

787
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,080
I see. Know any?

788
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,718
No.

789
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,236
* If I had the flight of a bronze wing

790
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,596
* Far over these plains I would fly

791
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,150
* And I'd fly to the arms of my loved one

792
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,437
* And there I'd be willing to die

793
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,035

No, Joe! Don't try anything.

801

I doubt if my stomach will stand up

811

Who was it?

You searched our camp.

01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,792
And forgive us our trespasses,

902
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,872
As we forgive those who trespass against us.

903
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,030
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

904
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,872
<i>But deliver us from evil</i>

905
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,516
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory.

906
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,158
For ever and ever,

907
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,196
Amen.

You very bad people.

912
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,958
You do bad things.

913
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,712
Australian man die.

914
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,358
You be very sorry.

915
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,637
Your Japanese sergeant,
you make disgrace for him.

916
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,472
Now I punish sergeant, too.

917
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,118
I take other soldier away.

918
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,316
Your sergeant feel bad shame,

919
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,039

No prison camp here for you.

923

I send you to Kotabaru. You walk now.

924
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,116
Go!

925
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,356
Go!

926
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,076
Prisoners. Attention!

927
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:13,351
This prisoner executed not for stealing,
but for striking Japanese guard.

928
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,274
But Japanese chivalry
permit honour to soldier.

929
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:22,239
Japanese Bushido is like
European law of chivalry.

I offer you last wish.

933

What you want?

934

Robin.

938
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,158
Robin!

939
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,150
Don't touch him! Don't dare touch him!

940
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,515
Keep your hands off him! Don't touch him!

941
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,670
- Don't touch him!
- Jean, don't.

942
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,318
The man's done no harm.

943
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,072
He's a Jap. Isn't that enough?

944
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,832
I hate him! I hate him!

945
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,478
I hate him!

946
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,120
(Sobbing) I hate him! I hate him!

Poor sergeant.

958
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,950
You can't really hate people, can you?

959
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,996
It's a wonderful thing to find out.

960
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,472
You're thinking of Joe.

961
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,155
I was thinking of the first time I saw him.

962
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,555
When he crawled out from under the truck.

963
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,995
His face when he heard me speak English...

964
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,515
And the times when we talked together...

965
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,516
...and we shared a cigarette.

966
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,752
And the time when he...
talked about a town called Alice.

967
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,230
(Jean speaks Malay)

968
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,151
As there is no man to speak for us,

969
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,391
forgive me if I ask you
to talk business with a woman.

970
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,832
(He replies in Malay)

971
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,632
What do you want?

972
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,395
We have walked for many hundreds of miles.

973
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,710
And no Japanese officer will take us in,

974
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,314
or feed us, or look after us when we're sick.

975
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,037
So for months we've marched
from town to town.

976
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,793
And in that time,
more than half of us have died.

977
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,632
Now our guard is dead.

978
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,793
If we go on till we find another
Japanese officer, he won't want us either.

979
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,589
He'll send us on again,
and we shall grow ill, and we shall all die.

980
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,237
It is written that the angels said,
"Every soul shall taste of death."

981
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,878
Is it not also written,

982
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:12,112
"If you be kind towards women,
God is well acquainted with what you do"?

983
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,952
<i>Where is that written? </i>

984
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,076
In the Fourth Sura.

985
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,878
Are you of the faith?

986
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,518
No.

987
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,477
But wise words are well in any faith.

988
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,596
Tell me what you want.

989
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,432
To stay here in your village.

990
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,710
To work in the rice field as your women do.

991
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,199
To work...

992
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,510
just for our food and somewhere to sleep.

993
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,273
White women have never worked
in the rice field.

994
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,999
White women have never marched
till they died.

995
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,032
We have little food,

996
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,678
little water.

997
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:50,196
Our young men have been taken
to work for the Japanese.

998
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,236
We will grow more food for everyone.

999
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,073
If I let you stay here,

1000
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,310
the Japanese might be angry.

1001
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,436
They might punish us,

1002
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,476
kill us.

1003
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,836
If you say we must go, we must go.

1004
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,837
We are in your hands.

1005
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,908
Oh, this'll be bad for my rheumatism!

1006
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,752
<i>I won't last long like this</i>

1007
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,070
You're the toughest of us all, Mrs Frith!

1008
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:58,152
You've lasted this far, you'll last for ever.

1009
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,272
Too much? Too heavy?

1010
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,238
I've told you before,
if a Malay can do it, I can do it.

1011
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,072
Come on, load me up.

1012
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,799
It isn't the first time I've been called horsey.

1013
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,874

1014

1019
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,830
* Up again, up again

1020
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,070
* Let us build it up again

1021
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,116

1028

(Pipes and drums play)

1030
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,433
The water's good, Suleiman.
You have done well.

1031
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,476
Good. Now I must go back to my home.

1032
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,630
- Where's that?
- Kuantan

1033
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,718
Kuantan?

1034
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,076
<i>Very bad Japanese man in Kuantan
during the war</i>

1035
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,230
Captain Sugaya. Many bad things done.

1036
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,992
Many evil things.

1037
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,198
Suleiman...

1038
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,838
I was in Kuantan.

1039
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,478
When we were starving...

1040
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:53,312
...a prisoner stole some food for us.

1041
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,072
Captain Sugaya crucified him.

1042
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:59,311
I remember that.
He was a long time in hospital.

1043
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,638
But he died!

1044
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,597
How could he be in hospital?

1045
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,636
My son shall tell you.

1046
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,475
Jacob! The Australian soldier
who was crucified during the war.

1047
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,312
Did he die?

1048
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,277
He went to hospital.

1049
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,679
What?

1050
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,512
Jacob, come here.

1051
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,434
Tell Miss Jean if that man...
Did he live or did he die?

1052
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,790
Captain Sugaya ordered him
to be taken down that night.

1053
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,713
<i>The guards were good
They took him to hospital</i>

1054
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,756

What is it, Jean?

1056
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,349
Oh, please help me!
Please help me to find him!

1057
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:56,035
I must know if he lived,
if he's alive, if he got home.

1058
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,751
You seem to have everything here.

1059
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,877
Sure. We've got a picture theatre
and a swimming pool.

1060
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,190
And two hotels, and another one going up.

1061
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:37,918
Alice is a beaut.

1062
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,752
There's your man.

1063
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,311
Hey, mate!

1064
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,072
Hello, Dave.

1065
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,718
I want you to meet Miss Paget.

1066
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:01,076
This is Jack Burns, Shell agent.
He's been here for 25 years.

1067
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,232
- He knows everybody.
- Hello, Miss Paget. Pleased to meet you.

1068
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,880
- Do you know a Joe...
- You're from England.

1069
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,509
- I've folks in Wolverhampton. Is that near you?
- About 200 miles away.

1070
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,354
- You know the Fletchers in Wolverhampton?
- Wolverhampton's a big place.

1071
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:17,193
Yes, I suppose so. What was it you wanted?

1072
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,111
Did you ever know a Joe Harman?

1073
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,952
Joe? Yeah, I knew him.

1074
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,917
Did he come home after the war?

1075
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,357
Sure. He took up his old position
as manager over at Willstown, out in the bush.

1076
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,396
He took his family with him, I suppose?

1077
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,232
I didn't know Joe was married.

1078
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,470
Oh, perhaps I got it wrong. Engaged?

1079
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,120
Could be. I never heard of it. You, Dave?

1080
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,758
<i>No</i>

1081
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,592
How do I get to Willstown?

1082
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,148
Eddie Connellan flies the mail out once a week.

1083
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,798
But it's a cow of a place.

1084
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,638
G'day, Dave.

1085
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,315
Hi, Sam. For Daphne Campbell.
Her shoes will be ready next week.

1086
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:25,030
I'm going across to Miller's now.
I'll be back this evening. I'll bring the beer then.

1087
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,998
This is Miss Paget.
She wants to get into Willstown.

1088
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,517
That's something new. Most people want
to get out of it. Get inside, Miss Paget.

1089
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:36,832
It don't take a minute to get into Willstown,
get through it and get out of it.

1090
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,232
It's all yours.

1091
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,152
Where can I find Joe Harman?

1092
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,798
Joe?

1093
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,836
- Yes. Is he around?
- He's not here.

1094
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,478
<i>He's gone off</i>

1095
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,516
<i>- Where to?
- He didn't say</i>

1096
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,636
<i>He's left the country I do know that</i>

1097
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,756
<i>He's been gone for a couple of months</i>

1098
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,990
Well, when's he due back?

1099
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,152
He don't write.
If he thinks as I do about Willstown,

1100
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,992
he'll NEVER come back.

1101
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,832
It's a fair cow, isn't it?

1102
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:24,270
Yes, it's a fair cow.

1103
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,879
Miss Paget and I don't know each other
very well. We never had much of a chance.

1104
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,633
- You know what happened.
- Are you all right now?

1105
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,278
I'm fine.

1106
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:39,909
Last time I saw her, she was dressed up
like a native with a sarong.

1107
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,911
<i>I don't remember much about it</i>

1108
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,672
<i>They were beating her up</i>

1109
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,472
Mr Harman, I've got some news for you.

1110
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,677
<i>You've come across the world to England
to look for her</i>

1111
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,318
That's right.

1112
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,949
Well, she's gone across the world to Australia
to look for you.

1113
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,995
Hey!

1114
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,036
(Aeroplane flies overhead)

1115
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,995
<i>TANNOY: Announcing the arrival of Trans
Australia Airways flight 571 from Darwin</i>

1116
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,076
(Tyres screech)

1117
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,112
(Aeroplane approaches)

1118
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:37,997
G'day, Paul. I'm going on with Eddie Connellan
to Willstown. Any messages for me?

1119
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,638
- No. Sorry, Joe.
- Are you sure?

1120
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,676
<i>No nothing</i>

1121
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,598
Joe.

1122
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:56,798
Oh, Joe.
