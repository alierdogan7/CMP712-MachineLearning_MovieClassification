00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:33,642
Parade rest.

4
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:43,120
As you all know, tonight
Colonel Blake will resume his
command after a week in Tokyo.

5
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,720
Now, unless I made a few remarks
about my recent stint...

6
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:48,426
as your temporary
supreme commander,

7
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:52,198
I would be derelict
in my "officiousness."

8
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:56,401
I think you'll all agree
that by trying to introduce
more discipline, more order,

9
00:01:56,475 --> 00:02:00,343
I have hopefully made this
a more enjoyable war for all of us.

10
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,974
Leadership is
a lonely business.

11
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,383
Your Napoleons, your Kaisers,

12
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,445
your Attilas the Hun...

13
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,687
were all alone there in the front office
as I have been this week.

14
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,663
I have thought of you,
and, oh, you have thought of me.

15
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:23,133
But some of the notes in the suggestion
box were really below the belt.

16
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:27,195
I mean, why drag
my mother into this?

17
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,272
- [Mutters]
- Oh.

18
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:35,007
Well, um,

19
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:37,549
that's about it.

20
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:41,848
Corporal, deform the men.

21
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:44,947

22

To the return of Henry Blake.

25
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,565
Able to leap tall bar stools
at a single bound.

26
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,576
Faster than a speeding nurse.

27
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,635
- It's Super Colonel!
- Ta-da!

28
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,116
- More cocoa, Frank?
- Just a smidge.

29
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:23,491
Frank, I'm gonna show you something
you've never seen before.

- Col. Blake's apologies, sir.

He won't be home
for two more days,

52
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,101
and he said that you should
keep carrying on.

53
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,641
I guess that goes
for both of you.

That'll be all, Corporal.
Dismissed. Smoke if you got 'em.

- Yes, sir.

- Full house every night.

62

- I think we're ready
to open the war on Broadway.
- Lots of head wounds.

63
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,255
That comes from trying to take hills
the other guys have grown fond of.

64
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,731
You pulled every one
of'em through.

You guys make me

- All right, Henry, what is it?
- What is what it?

67
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,678
Henry, you're bursting with something.
Your face could open a branch smile.

00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:59,775
Okay, guys,
brace yourselves.

69
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:02,412
- Sit down.
- We're sitting, Henry.

70
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,321
Then I'll sit. I can't sit.
I'm already sitting.

- Then I gotta stand.

Okay, guys, okay.

Okay, okay,
I know it's crazy.

75
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:22,424
I'm 44 years old and I only hear
about half of what anybody says.

76
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,960
And I'm starting to brush
my hair with a towel.

77
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:28,555
And my hips are forming
a rain gutter for my waist.

78
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:31,395
And I'm thinking about moving
my cot into the latrine...

79
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,402
so that I can cut down
on the traveling time.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,633
And yet, this middle-aged mess
from Bloomington, Illinois,

81
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:41,768
is head-over-heels,
puppy-dog in love.

Well, don't keep us in suspense.
Who's the man, woman or child?

- Check one.
- Fourth picture's the best.

84
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,815
That's a nice looking kid.

85
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:56,389
- Real winner.
- And you're in love with her mother?

86
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,189
Get out.
No, that's it. That's her.

Nancy Sue.

88
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,568
Henry, did you get a chance
to ask her her age before
the gym teacher called the police?

89
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:10,231
Just a minute here. She's no kid.
She'll be 21 in August.

90
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,173
Henry, you've got
a corn that's 21.

94

- No, Henry, we didn't say that.
- Where did you meet her?

95
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:28,890
I'm in the Dai-Ichi Hotel coffee shop
with Mel Rosenbloom. He's the...

- The U.N. Gynecologist?
- The U.N. Gynecologist.

And we're trying to decide which
bathhouse to go to after breakfast.

98
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:39,562
Well, the hostess comes over
and she says, "Do you mind sharing?"

99
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:43,401
And wham, bang, Miss Nancy Sue Parker
of Independence, Ohio,

100
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:47,170
pulls up a chair and sits
right down in my heart.

101
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:50,872
- Hit me.
- <i>She's a clerk typist,</i>

102
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,279
a civilian,
with the air force.

103
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,718
Our eyes met and it was as though
we'd known each other all our lives.

104
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,721
Except that you're
one life up on her.

105
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,815
Half-hour later,
there I am,

"I'm in love" to everybody in sight.

Henry, what is there to do?

115
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:35,820
You've flung your fling.
You spent a week in the rumble seat
of the time machine.

116
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:40,454
Now it's back to Dr. And Mrs.
Henry Blake regret to announce
their forthcoming anniversary.

I grant you, sometimes you can't
always tell the difference.

Henry, why don't you just file
this under "Andy Hardy Remembers

00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:15,842
- Uh-huh.
- You okay?

168
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,141
Of course I am.

169
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:22,913
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight,

170
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,919
twenty-nine...

171
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,853
- Hey, Henry, she get here yet?
- Not yet.

172
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,920
The school bus must be late.

173
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:38,364
Pierce, 86 on those cracks.

174
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,868
- As a personal order?
- Okay, Henry.

175
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:43,336
Teenager at 2:00.

176
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,518
- Hi!
- Hi, Henry.

177
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:05,083
Oh! Easy. Now watch it. Don't get
your pretty little foot caught.

178
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,721
Kill your engine, will you?

179
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:11,392
I'm a doctor, you can believe me.
That's a nice leg.

180
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,698
That sweater's not filled
with chopped liver either.

181
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,795
Whoopsie.
Watch the mud.

182
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,806
Radar! Hold on.

183
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,777
Miss Nancy Sue Parker,
these are Captains Pierce...

184
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,814
And these are Captains Mclntyre.

185
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:28,247
Hi. So nice to meet you.

186
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:31,115
Henry's told me
what great doctors you are.

187
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:34,020
Just by seeing you
I can tell it's true.

188
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:37,321
- Radar!
- Yes, sir?

189
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,861
- Would you take Miss Parker's...
- Bags. Yes, sir.

190
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,365
And you, you just have to be
Corporal O'Reilly.

191
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:45,957
Yes, I just
have to be, ma'am.

192
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,265
Nobody else wants to be.

193
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:50,271
Is he adorable?

194
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,705
You just wanna take him home
and cuddle him.

195
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,709
We do that all the time.

196
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,371
But if you get him wet,
his stuffing comes out.

197
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:01,576
Okay, guys, I think
we'll just run along.

198
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,210
Would you like to
freshen up, Nancy?

199
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:07,084
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

200
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:09,784
It's nice to have met you.
Will I see you again?

201
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,259
Oh, yes, we live here.

202
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,626
Well, come along, dear.

203
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:23,499
- What do you think?
- The age difference could be a problem.

204
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,200
Yeah. She's 21
and his wife is 42.

205
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:29,844
Well, here you go.

206
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,779
Yep, we've had a lot
of V.I.P. S in here.

207
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:35,578
But no one V.I.P. Er than you.

208
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,123
Okay, Radar.
<i>Mucho</i> "appreciado."

209
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:47,655
Thanks a lot.

210
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,755
Uh, will that be all, sir?

211
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:52,357
That'll be more
than all, Radar.

212
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:59,501
Do you wanna answer
those letters home, sir?

213
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:02,066
Not now, Radar.

214
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,374
- Yes, sir.
- Bye, Radar.

215
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,471
Bye, ma'am.

216
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:08,813
He really is adorable.

217
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,721
The whole place is adorable!

218
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,950
Oh, Henry.

219
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:19,358
- Gosh, did I ever miss you.
- Me too.

220
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:22,226
- You're all I thought about.
- Me too.

221
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,963
- What are you wearing?
- Practically nothing.

222
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:33,872
Rats!
I gotta go on duty.

223
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:36,935
I got a patient
with a weepy abscess.

224
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,242
- Boy, I love you.
- Me too.

00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:49,155
- Dry martini, right, Captain?
- There should be dust on the olive.

228
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:51,693
- Sheila?
- I'd like something weak.

229
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,024
How 'bout me?
I can't say no to anybody.

230
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:57,156
- I'll just have some ginger ale.
- Yes, ma'am.

- Oh.
- ## [Humming]

00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:05,665
There she is.

233
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:08,972
Nancy Sue, I'd like you to meet
two of my friends. This is Bob.

234
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,638
Is that what all
the fuss is about?

235
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:15,241
- <i>[Henry Laughing]</i>
- He's making a jackass out of himself.

236
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:17,649
- It's immoral.
- Disgusting.

237
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,385
- Frank, is that your knee?
- I thought it was yours.

238
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,586
Well, as long as it's ours.

239
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:29,297
Watch it.

240
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,856
- All we have to be is polite.
Simply correct.
- Right.

241
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,903
- Anything more looks like we approve.
- How could we?

242
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,905
A married man fooling around
with another woman.

243
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,675
- Honey, I want you to meet some people.
- Okay.

244
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:47,910
Miss Parker, Majors
Houlihan and Burns.

245
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,917
Nancy, Margaret, Frank.

246
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm Frank.
She's Margaret.

247
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:57,448
It's a very genuine pleasure
to have you at the 4077 th, Nancy dear.

248
00:16:57,526 --> 00:17:01,724
Oh, it's mine too. Everyone's been
so terrific about being nice to me.

249
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:04,732
It's nice to be nice
to the nice.

250
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,669
She's darling, Henry.

251
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,604
Looks a little like your oldest
daughter, doesn't she, Frank?

252
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,509
<i>He has three.</i>

253
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,545
They're all back
in the States.

00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:20,241
Well, "goom-bye," people.

255
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:22,307
We're gonna wet our whistle.

256
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,545
Glad to have met you.

257
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:30,391
"It's nice to be nice to the nice"?

258
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,394
Just making conversation.

259
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,260
Try doing it
with your mouth shut.

260
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:41,002
Well, have fun, kids.

261
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:47,168
Oh, you remember Capt. Pierce.
And this is Lt. Sturner.

- Hi.
- Hi.

263
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:53,177
- Can I interest you two in a blast?
Kwang, we'll have...
- One Pink Lady.

264
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,979
- And I'll have a Peach Blow Fizz.
- <i>[Kwang] Yes, sir.</i>

- Done what, dear?

268
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:11,595
This is just like my music from
Ohio State. I used to be a cheerleader.

269
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,227
I don't know why
that doesn't surprise me.

270
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:18,364
Does that take me back to
those Saturday afternoons.

271
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,102
Kwang, I think we'll have
our drinks at the table.

272
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:23,736
God, makes my legs homesick.

273
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:27,077
- Give us a cheer, Nance.
- Pierce.

274

Come on.
One for the Gipper.

275
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,140
Look at Henry.

276
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:03,081

Wow.

Oh, wow!
That was swell.

Big news, Nancy. The team
broke its leg. They want you

281
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:23,127
I used to be so much better.
I'm so out of shape.

00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:26,470
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Steady, Mclntyre.

No, no, you've had a little

Henry, get away from the ether.

- Breakfast is at 5:00.
- But isn't it still dark then?

00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,098
It helps if you can't see it.

They saved up their money,

I'd be tall when I was 21.

you knew it too.

00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:36,225
Don't send me your stubs. I can't
balance your checkbook in a war zone.

331
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,827
Lorraine? Lorraine?

332
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:42,705
Lorraine, please don't talk to me
and the kids at the same time.

333
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:45,404
<i>L</i>... <i>What</i>...
<i>Andrew?</i>

334
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:49,471
Andrew, I don't care if your sister did
put an ice cube down your underwear.

335
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:53,212
Girls will do that.
You mustn't hit her with the dog.

336
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:59,991
Now look, Andrew. Until I get home,
you're the man of the house.

337
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know Mommy thinks that she is,

338
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:05,731
but you really are.

339
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,963
So behave yourself and take good care
of everybody till I get back.

340
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,869
Just as soon as the war
is over, son.

341
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:15,203
Okay, pal, put her on.

342
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:19,843
Lorraine, honey...
Yeah. Send me the check stubs.

343
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:22,814
I'll straighten it out.

344
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,816
Of course I do.

345
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,154
Good-bye, darling.

346
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,253
What do you guys want?

347
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,666
- We... We just wanted to say
good night, Henry.
- Right, yeah.

348
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:47,001
Listen. Remember I said I found
a girl who was the real thing?

349
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:51,337
Well, she's $68 overdrawn.

350
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,517
- Good night.
- Good night, Henry.

351
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,849
Good night.

352
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:06,857
- Radar?
- Sir?

353
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:10,384
- My wife was very grateful
that I called her.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

354
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:12,431
Makes me wish I had.

355
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:16,060
Well, I figured since you didn't
have time to answer her letters...

356
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:20,538
Good night, Radar.
See you at breakfast.

357
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,438
Yes, sir. 5:00 sharp.

358
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,206
Let's give ourselves a treat, huh?
5:15?

359
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,112
Yes, sir.

360
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:39,887
Now, you will call me,
won't you, Henry?

361
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,893
Oh, yeah, sure.

362
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:45,795
I don't get to Tokyo that often,
but you'll be the first.

363
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,799
Good-bye, Henry.

364
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,833
Rah, rah.

365
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,352
That's life, huh?

366
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,356
I couldn't wait till she got here.
Now I'm glad she's gone.

367
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,585
Just as well, Henry.

368
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,926
If you'd sucked your gut in
one more time, your belly button
would've fallen out your back.
