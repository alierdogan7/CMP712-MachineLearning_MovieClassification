1
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,667
- Ring me.
- Thank you, Mr Hanley. I´ll be in touch.

2
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,200
Good luck.

3
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,133
<i>Flight BAQ 113 to London Heathrow</i>

4
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>is now boarding at Gate 54.</i>

5
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
- Good morning.
- Morning.

6
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,800
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

7
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,067
- So, how was London?
- Fine.

8
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:48,267
Hammers lost 5-3,
but apart from that, pretty good.

9
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,667
Thank you.

10
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:30,333
- Have a good flight, sir.
- Thank you.

11
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,467
- So, when do we lose you?
- Ah. Soon as they can find my replacement.

12
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:44,000
Number 10
will make the announcement tomorrow.

13
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,133
- Until then, we keep it under wraps, okay?
- Mark.

14
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,733
Caroline, hi. How are you?

15
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:58,733
Good. This is my dad, Anthony.
Dad, Sir Mark Brydon.

16
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:03,133
- Mark. How do you do?
- Delighted to meet you.

17
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,800
My Counsellor for External Affairs,
Nicholas Brocklehurst.

18
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,067
- This is Anthony Hanley of Hanley International?
- Yes.

19
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,533
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure.

20
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,667
And Caroline Hanley, of the...

21
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:23,400
The Lowenberg Institute
for Foreign Relations.

22
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,400
I read your paper on US policy
in Central Asia. It´s really interesting.

23
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Thank you.

24
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,067
And you still haven´t confirmed Tuesday.
Dinner, erudite company, how could you refuse?

25
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:44,067
Well, you know Sally. Got it in my diary?
Sally, what´s going on that night?

26
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:49,133
Well, there´s a clash. You´re pencilled in
with the Daughters of the Revolution.

27
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:54,200
<i>- In that case, I´ll be seeing you on Tuesday.
- Last call, flight BAQ...</i>

28
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,533
- That´s you, Dad.
- I´m afraid I must dash.

29
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,333
- Lovely to meet you at last.
- Pleasure.

30
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:05,067
<i>Last call for flight BAQ 113
to London Heathrow.</i>

31
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:11,867
Sorry, I had to double check your booking
for the First Lady´s charity ball.

32
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,800
They want to issue a press release...

33
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,933
- Good morning, Mr Ambassador.
- Good morning, Tim.

34
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,067
This way.

35
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,600
I hope you enjoy the flight, sir.

36
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:46,867
- Please turn off the laptop, sir.
- Of course.

37
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,267
Today´s schedule.

38
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:23,467
The service kicks off at 11:00.
Lunch is at Armitage Headquarters.

39
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:28,400
You´re on after the Secretary of Defense.

40
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,400
I think you should know
that James Sinclair is in town.

41
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:42,800
The press have picked up on his campaign
against UK-US support of President Usman.

42
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,467
Political prisoners tortured in Tyrgyztan,
suppressión of opposition etc.

43
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:54,800
Take a look at this.

44
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,467
There´ve been several calls
about yours and Sinclair´s friendship.

45
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:14,133
Tell them we were good friends in the ´90s,

46
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:19,800
but in recent years our paths
have taken different directions.

47
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mr Sinclair rang yesterday
asking to speak to you.

48
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,067
Shit.

49
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:32,800
The Embassy is to have no contact
with him while he´s in Washington.

50
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,467
Yep.

51
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:42,267
- What the...
- What was that?

52
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,333
Shit!

53
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:53,400
Shit. It´s gonna come down.
It´s gonna come down.

54
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,333
Can you get over to the left?

55
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,733
What´s happening?

56
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:28,267
Mark, stay in the car.
Stay in the car. Mark!

57
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,667
Help me!

58
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:45,267
Help me! Help me!

59
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,000
Help!

60
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,067
Help me! Oh, please, help me!

61
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,533
Help me! Please!

62
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:14,200
My name´s Mark. I´m gonna help you.
What´s your name? What´s your name?

63
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,067
Please help me! Help me!

64
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:22,800
Look at me. Look at me.
All right, we´re gonna get you out of here.

65
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,867
- My leg is stuck.
- Mark, Get away from the car. Mark!

66
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:32,133
- Please help me!
- Pull it, pull it! Calm down.

67
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,000
- Please help me.
- I know it hurts.

68
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,000
- Just give me your hand.
- Mark, I can smell petrol.

69
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,600
- Mark, look, you´ve got to get away.
- Don´t leave me!

70
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,867
Get back, Mark, it´s gonna blow.
Get up, get up!

71
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,267
Mark, it´s the flight to London.

72
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,200
Styles.

73
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:25,933
What? Where?

74
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:32,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please.</i>

75
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,667
<i>It is my great pleasure
to welcome my predecessor here at Armitage,</i>

76
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:50,667
<i>and now our esteemed Secretary of Defense,
Lynne Warner.</i>

77
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:01,667
<i>Thank you, Gordon. Thank you.</i>

78
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:08,333
<i>There´s very little that can pry me
out of the Pentagon these days,</i>

79
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:14,400
<i>but it is with great pride
that I stand here today.</i>

80
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:29,933
You, with me now!

81
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:38,667
<i>Since this corporation
was founded in 1981,</i>

82
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:45,867
<i>it has steadfastly generated wealth
and jobs for the people of this country.</i>

83
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:55,333
<i>In the nine years that I was privileged
to steer this ship,</i>

84
00:16:55,533 --> 00:17:04,267
<i>and now under the able captaincy of
Gordon Adair, profits have doubled annually.</i>

85
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:11,933
<i>Armitage has investments and holdings
in over 90 nations.</i>

86
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:15,000
<i>Excuse me.</i>

87
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,867
<i>So I want to say, God bless Armitage.</i>

88
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:30,400
<i>May she enjoy another 25 years
of glorious growth.</i>

89
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,667
<i>Congratulations.</i>

90
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:46,333
<i>Thank you, Lynne.
Lynne Warner, Secretary of Defense.</i>

91
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:54,800
An explosión brought down
a passenger plane. We could be under attack.

92
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:39,200
<i>We are just getting reports of a plane crash
to the west of Washington, DC.</i>

93
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,733
Phil! Phil, it´s for you.

94
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:55,733
Phil. Understood.

95
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:06,933
The Ambassador is on his way up.
Everybody next door now, please.

96
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:32,667
There were 262 passengers,
97 of whom were British citizens.

97
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:36,800
Emergency Services are reporting
no survivors.

98
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,733
There are nine reported fatalities
on the ground, 43 casualties.

99
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,867
Where´s the President?

100
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:51,067
At Camp David for the weekend.
He´s been taken to the bunker.

101
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:55,333
A Code Red has been issued.

102
00:19:55,533 --> 00:20:01,667
The security agencies will be treating it
as an act of terror till proven otherwise.

103
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,733
Let´s see that the relatives of the
British victims are kept informed.

104
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:11,733
Let´s open a free 24-hour helpline.
Nasreen, make sure

105
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:15,467
- the UK broadcasting services get the number.
- Okay.

106
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:23,333
We´ll need volunteers to man it.
Anyone not essential to emergency procedure.

107
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,067
Thank you. The Prime Minister
will be contacting the President.

108
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:35,733
I will also be sending a message of sympathy

109
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:41,733
on behalf of the Embassy
for the terrible loss of US lives.

110
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:47,133
- Sally, could we organise a book of condolence?
- Okay.

111
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:54,267
At this stage we don´t know if the explosión
will remain an isolated event

112
00:20:54,467 --> 00:21:00,867
so if anyone here wishes to be
with their families at this difficult time,

113
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:07,667
it´s absolutely fine to go home.
Please do let us know first.

114
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,267
Thank you. Let´s get to it.

115
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:22,667
What did the PM offer you?

116
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:28,267
- It´s not really the time, Phil.
- Foreign Secretary?

117
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:37,200
- There´s a by-election to win first.
- Any clue as to who your successor might be?

118
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:44,533
Politics will suit you.

119
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:31,667
I want tanks at the airport now.

120
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:37,600
With respect, Lynne, that´s pretty extreme.
We have enough personnel on the ground

121
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,533
without deploying hardware.

122
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:44,933
We are sending a message, sir.

123
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:18,733
<i>... though most are now open to air traffic.</i>

124
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:22,133
<i>It´s not just the US that´s been affected.</i>

125
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:27,067
<i>In England, the army was out in force
at London´s Heathrow Airport</i>

126
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:34,867
<i>when British Intelligence intercepted a threat
to shoot down an aircraft using a Stinger missile.</i>

127
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:39,333
<i>All across Europe flights have been delayed.</i>

128
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:45,467
<i>Some passengers have been waiting
12 hours for flights...</i>

129
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:27,933
<i>Have you had a good trip
over here, Mr Hanley?</i>

130
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,933
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

131
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:34,933
<i>I´ve had a good look at the paperwork.
It all seems fine to me.</i>

132
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:39,800
<i>I will need copies of the export licences.</i>

133
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:53,467
<i>As agreed, 100 triggers immediately,
the remaining 25 to follow.</i>

134
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:30,600
Any luck with the rest of Hanley´s effects?

135
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,133
Listen, there´s something else
I need you to do.

136
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:46,933
No names, I´m gonna need to keep myself clean,
and the Ambassador doesn´t need to know.

137
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,933
You go ahead. I´ll catch you up.

138
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:57,867
- Hi.
- Hi.

139
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,133
I´m so sorry.

140
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:22,333
They hope to identify him by his effects.

141
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,267
I said I would like to see him, but...

142
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,067
Is there no one with you?

143
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,533
Caroline Hanley?

144
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:56,400
- Yeah.
- If you´d like to follow me, ma´am.

145
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,933
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, no.

146
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:07,800
- Sure?
- I´ll be fine. Thanks.

147
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,867
Thanks.

148
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:12,067
It´s been confirmed. There was a bomb.

149
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:14,800
Shit.

150
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,600
FBI and CIA are liaising with Ml6. They´ve
requested intel on all British passengers.

151
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:54,333
Caroline, I need you to take a look at these
items and see if you can identify them, okay?

152
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:02,800
Dad gave up smoking 10 years ago.

153
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:07,600
There´s an inscription inside.

154
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:20,800
"To my darling Anthony, happy anniversary,
your Kate. 19th August 1990."

155
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:28,067
Mum. She died the following March.

156
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:36,400
So you can confirm that these articles
did belong to Anthony Gerald Hanley?

157
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,200
Mmm.

158
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:46,933
My condolences, ma´am.

159
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:11,267
- Anthony?
- Mmm.

160
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:19,800
Come on, I´m gonna take you home.
Okay. Come on.

161
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,933
<i>Earlier today the FBI confirmed</i>

162
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:39,800
<i>that the plane crash on the Washington
Beltway was caused by a bomb.</i>

163
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,533
<i>Since then, airports around the US
have been on heightened alert.</i>

164
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:53,267
<i>Many remain closed to air traffic.
It is not just the US that has been affected.</i>

in force at Heathrow airport...</i>

166
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,267
- How are you, Sir Mark?
- I´m fine, thanks.

167
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:42,867
- Kind of you to wait up.
- Can I get you anything?

168
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:50,733
No, thanks, Jennifer, you go off to bed.
I... I have some things to do.

169
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:38,867
Mrs Standish? Mark Brydon,
I´m the British Ambassador here in Washington.

170
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:48,733
I just wanted to say how sorry I was
to hear of your husband´s death.

171
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,867
Mrs Stevens, my name is Mark Brydon.

172
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:23,667
I´m so sorry again.

173
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:10,733
- Don´t fire! Don´t fire!
- Don´t fire! Don´t fire!

174
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:16,867
Cease fire, cease fire!

175
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:21,800
Medic! Medic!

176
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,267
What do you think you´re doing on the ground?
Medic! We need a medic over here now.

177
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:32,600
Hang on, mate. Hang on. Hang on.

178
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,467
We´re supposed to be training,
didn´t you know the rules?

179
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,800
Jesus!

180
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,333
You take a good look

181
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:21,400
because that is what happens to tossers
who don´t pay attention.

182
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:29,867
Now strip him. I said strip him!

183
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,733
Stand aside.

184
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,200
Toss him over.

185
00:40:55,667 --> 00:41:01,067
<i>In no way am I condoning the appalling
events of yesterday.</i>

186
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:08,267
<i>All I´m saying is that the stance
the UKand the US take internationally,</i>

187
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:14,400
<i>it can be interpreted by certain groups
as provocation.</i>

188
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,000
<i>Can you elaborate on that?</i>

189
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,533
<i>Right, well, take Tyrgyztan,
where I was ambassador.</i>

190
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:29,200
<i>Since ´99, the UKand the US
have invested over 50 billion dollars,</i>

191
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:39,067
<i>and at the same time 10,000 political prisoners
have disappeared under President Usman´s rule.</i>

192
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:44,467
<i>Did you inform your government at the time
of suspected human rights abuse?</i>

193
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:50,133
<i>Of course, but every cable
I sent to London, nothing.</i>

194
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:55,533
<i>Deafening silence from the other end,
and that´s when I started to speak up.</i>

195
00:41:55,733 --> 00:42:02,200
<i>You´re saying the UKgovernment deliberately
ignored your allegations?</i>

196
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,733
<i>Not only that, they hauled me home,
slapped my wrists,</i>

197
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:11,800
<i>and when that didn´t work,
they sacked me.</i>

198
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,333
<i>It´s this questionable support of corrupt regimes
that helps inflame the enemies of the West.</i>

199
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,533
<i>Thank you, James.</i>

200
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:31,133
<i>That was James Sinclair.
British Ambassador to Tyrgyztan, 1997 to 2001.</i>

201
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,800
<i>Now back to the news team for an update
on the terrorist attack.</i>

202
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,267
Well, you´re looking well.

203
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,333
You missed me on the telly.

204
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:49,067
- Coffee, sir?
- I´m not staying, thank you.

205
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:58,200
We´re getting a good response to the campaign.
Americans across the political spectrum

206
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,200
- are questioning foreign policy.
- I can´t hear this, James.

207
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,733
Come on, can´t we at least discuss it?
We´ve got a lot of catching up to do.

208
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:14,333
I can´t even be seen with you.

209
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:19,667
Then why did you ask to meet me?

210
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:23,400
Stop calling the Embassy.

211
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,667
Don´t try and use our relationship
to further your cause.

212
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:34,600
This isn´t my cause. You know
bloody well what´s going on in Tyrgyztan...

213
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,333
This has to stop, all right?

214
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:44,067
For Christ´s sake.

215
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,467
This is for Azzam.

216
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:05,467
Why don´t you give it to him yourself?
I´m sure he´d like to get to know his godfather.

217
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:08,000
Tell him...

218
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:12,800
I wish circumstances were different.

219
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,733
He´s nine years old.
All he knows is people in his life disappear.

220
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,067
Just leave me alone.

221
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,600
Dulles Airport is scheduled
to reopen at 11:00.

222
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,200
The first of the relatives
arrive this afternoon.

223
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:10,400
The authorities are very jittery. One unclaimed
suitcase, they will shut down the entire system.

224
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,067
Has anyone claimed responsibility?

225
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:18,667
Islamic European Jihad,
but no serious contenders.

226
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:24,867
As far as we know, it could be
white supremacists, a lone nutter.

227
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:27,333
How´s this playing in the UK media?

228
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:31,600
It´s mostly leading with mutual grief
of two allied countries.

229
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,933
I´ve told Sally she should cancel
tonight´s reception.

230
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,333
Absolutely not, we go ahead.

231
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:46,733
Let´s put a release out. Show our resolve.
Something along the lines of, um...

232
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:54,067
"Yesterday´s tragedy will not distract us
from pursuing our international aims."

233
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,867
Please let´s avoid
the "spirit of the Blitz" cliché.

234
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:01,000
I´ll run it past you before I issue.

235
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,733
- Next.
- James Sinclair.

236
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:12,133
Do we need to draft a rebuttal denying the claims
he´s made about UK-US aid to Tyrgyztan,

237
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:15,467
and our support
for President Usman´s government?

238
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:20,600
Don´t give that windbag oxygen.

239
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:31,333
Phil´s right. No comment on his visit. Next.

240
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:38,133
Luke Gardner´s death row appeal
is before the Supreme Court this week.

241
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:46,067
<i>We expect the ruling in
the next couple of days.</i>

242
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:53,333
<i>Jane Lavery, our new human rights liaison,
has gone down to Florida</i>

243
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:58,200
<i>to coordinate with the release campaign.</i>

244
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:11,067
There´s interest in this both sides of the pond.
Falklands hero on death row.

245
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,867
Thank you.

246
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:21,667
- Where´s Sam?
- Sorry?

247
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:25,800
My lawyer, Sam Levinson.

248
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,600
I wanted the opportunity
to talk to you alone, Mr Gardner.

249
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,800
My name is Jane Lavery,
I´m a vice-consul at the Embassy.

250
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,800
He told me.

251
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,867
- I´m on secondment from London.
- He told me.

252
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:48,867
I´m a Gemini. Did he tell you that?

253
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,200
We need to talk about your appeal.

254
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,133
The Supreme Court is ruling on whether
you received ineffective representation.

255
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,667
You´re wasting my time.

256
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:12,800
If you´re not prepared to talk to me,
you´re wasting mine.

257
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:24,400
Now, your previous counsel failed
to introduce evidence from witnesses

258
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,133
who claimed they saw you two miles
from the scene of the murder,

259
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:36,733
- fighting with a cab driver.
- I can´t remember a cab driver.

260
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,067
I can´t remember most of that year.

261
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:51,800
Well, if you can´t remember,
how do you know you didn´t kill those giris?

262
00:49:54,133 --> 00:50:01,133
I´d know. I´ve had blood on my hands before.

263
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:08,467
The Foreign Office have
a strong anti-death penalty stance,

264
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:13,267
regardless of your innocence or guilt,
I´m here to inform you

265
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:18,067
that they have made official representation
to the Supreme Court.

266
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:21,733
- Heads or tails?
- What?

267
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:30,267
Heads or tails, choose.

268
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:37,200
Heads.

269
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:44,133
You´ve chosen to die by lethal injection.

270
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,267
Now, they say it takes four minutes to die,

271
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:58,800
but the doctor doesn´t pronounce for 15.

272
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:07,000
I bet you wished you´d picked
tails now, eh, Jane?

273
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,400
You tell me.

274
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:17,933
Death by electric chair.

275
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,800
You ever smelt burning flesh?

276
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,667
It stays in your nostrils for life.

277
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,267
But they say it´s quicker.

278
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:44,600
But do I really want that
to be my mum´s last memory of me?

279
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:55,600
Tricky call. I´m not some kind of freak show.

280
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,667
So you take your anti-death penalty stance

281
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:07,600
and you get me the fuck out of here,
all right, bitch?

282
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,067
- Come in.
- We have a problem.

283
00:53:21,267 --> 00:53:25,200
Ah, could you excuse us a moment?

284
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:38,133
One of the British passengers on the plane,
Hassan Khan,

285
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:43,600
- MI6 have turned up a second identity.
- Which is?

286
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,667
Ibrahim Wahid.

287
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:50,667
Suspected of having links
to a Jihadi training camp

288
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:54,933
and the Islamist movement of Tyrgyztan.

289
00:53:55,133 --> 00:54:00,267
- Tyrgyztan?
- It´s on the northern border of Afghanistan.

290
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,267
I know where it is.

291
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,400
National Security Advisor´s
in your office, ma´am.

292
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:15,467
Tyrgyztan?
They´re supposed to be our goddamn allies.

293
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:24,067
It´s tough enough keeping a lid on the Mid-East.
What, now we have a Central Asia dimensión?

294
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:30,733
According to MI6, President Usman claims
to have suppressed the militants.

295
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:36,267
- Christopher?
- We have our doubts, ma´am.

296
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:45,333
We´re paying that ingrate $100 million a year
to scratch his balls. Jesus!

297
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:53,067
Scramble F-16s from our bases there
and bomb the terrorists for him.

298
00:54:53,267 --> 00:54:56,733
Show the asshole how it´s done.

299
00:54:56,933 --> 00:55:01,133
Suspect bomber was a British national.

300
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:07,667
Any link to a militant group in Tyrgyztan
is unsubstantiated.

301
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,467
Give me strength.

302
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,933
I´m supposed to be standing shoulder
to shoulder with the Brit Ambassador

303
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:24,067
in our moment of loss.

304
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:33,267
It turns out it´s one of their home-grown
massacring our people?

305
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:43,867
Didn´t 7/7 teach them anything,
for Christ´s sake?

306
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:49,867
What should we tell the speech writers?

307
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:55,800
Oh, try, "lf Britain´s our friend,
who needs enemies?"

308
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:06,000
<i>The hunt for the terrorist group
behind the bombing of flight 113</i>

309
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,867
<i>took on a new dimensión today</i>

310
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:15,600
<i>as intelligence sources released information
on their chief suspect.</i>

311
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:21,400
Several news channels are reporting
links between Hassan Khan-Ibrahim Wahid

312
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,067
and militants in the hills of Tyrgyztan.

313
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:30,133
Also an Al-Qaeda group in North Pakistan.

314
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:34,200
Where the bloody hell are they
getting this stuff?

315
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:41,200
All right, I´m gonna need a complete dossier
on Khan-Wahid. Full background.

316
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,067
Home life, schooling, mosque,
overseas travel.

317
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:50,667
And see if you can find out from your guys
in MI6 exactly who these groups are.

318
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:56,600
What their aims are. We need
to sort out the facts from the fiction.

319
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,400
Someone´s leaked this
before we can prepare a proper response.

320
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,467
Sure.

321
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:06,667
Paul, has forensics turned up anything
on the bomb?

322
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:15,533
Debris indicates the explosives were in the hold.
They´re not certain what type or grade yet.

323
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:24,133
It´s looking that they were detonated
by an electronic signal from the passenger deck.

324
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:27,000
Mark, it´s Garcia.

325
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:37,467
Carl. Yes, of course.

326
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,800
Not at all. Goodbye, sir.

327
00:57:49,867 --> 00:57:55,267
- We´re going to the West Wing.
- Invited or summoned?

328
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,333
In the Situations Room in five.

329
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:11,867
How the hell
did the bastard slip under your radar?

330
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:17,933
- Hassan Khan was a clean skin.
- His alias Ibrahim Wahid wasn´t.

331
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:22,667
There´s been a massive failure of intelligence
your side of the pond.

332
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:25,800
Warner is incendiary.

333
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:32,267
She´s in with the President right now.

334
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:38,400
Be warned. She´s talking UK flight embargoes,
visa restrictions.

335
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,667
The President´s not seriously
considering that?

336
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,333
Yes, Mark.

337
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:51,800
When Warner buried her only son
in Arlington Cemetery,

338
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,533
she bought this President the election.

339
00:58:55,733 --> 00:59:02,400
The woman´s untouchable.
I´m doing what I can,

340
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,933
but, frankly, she´s only reflecting
the mood of the people.

341
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:10,067
Half the US citizens right now wouldn´t care

342
00:59:10,267 --> 00:59:13,267
if we tore up our passports
and closed our borders.

343
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:20,467
If she lets this damage UK-US relations,
she´ll be doing the terrorists´ job for them.

344
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:29,267
For Christ´s sake, Mark, there are American
body parts on a beltway courtesy of a Brit Muslim.

345
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:34,200
You´ve tolerated these extremists too long.

346
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:42,400
Sure, we´re not gonna slash and burn England,
but the President has to be seen to do something.

347
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,467
What if I get the PM out here
in a gesture of solidarity?

348
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:54,533
Too soon. That´ll just expose him
to a tidal wave of public anger.

349
00:59:54,733 --> 00:59:57,400
People are panicking.

350
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,667
The US could be facing
a new wave of suicide attacks.

351
01:00:01,867 --> 01:00:08,467
If you don´t want hysteria,
stop leaking intel to the media.

352
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,533
It´s not the Agency.

353
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:19,933
I´ll talk to Warner, try to cool things down.

354
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:25,133
Statement will be issued at 3:00.

355
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:30,733
- I´ll call you by 2:00.
- I appreciate the heads up.

356
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:39,133
There were British body parts
on the beltway, too, Carl.

357
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:41,267
I know.

358
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:57,267
- If it´s not the Agency...
- The leak must be coming from the Pentagon.

359
01:00:57,467 --> 01:01:01,667
Whatever Warner is up to
we have to nip it in the bud.

360
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:06,533
- Have we opened the book of condolence yet?
- No idea. Why?

361
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:10,600
If we haven´t, let´s get Sally to wait.

362
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,733
<i>We´re under attack, right?
I say bring our boys home.</i>

363
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:26,533
<i>It´s us folks need defending.
The enemy´s right here, on our streets.</i>

364
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:32,533
<i>Hey, thank you, Jack, for that.
Sounds like you´re pretty angry out there.</i>

365
01:01:32,733 --> 01:01:37,333
<i>Next caller, Joanne from Kissimmee.</i>

366
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:45,200
<i>Hi, why is it every time there´s
a terrorist scare I can´t buy bottled water?</i>

367
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:48,200
<i>What the heck?</i>

368
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,133
Sam Levinson. No, no, no.

369
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:09,200
No, no. Come on, I can´t...

370
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:21,000
No, I told you before, I can´t even comment
on that until after the Supreme Court decisión.

371
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:32,667
<i>Hello, I´m Matthew Weiss. I´m covering
Luke´s story with The Washington Press.</i>

372
01:02:32,867 --> 01:02:36,867
Jane Lavery, British Embassy.

373
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,933
I´m surprised the press are interested
in the Britain death row.

374
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:49,267
- You kidding? This guy could be me.
- I doubt it.

375
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,667
I´m serious, he´s in danger of getting fried
over a legal technicality.

376
01:02:57,867 --> 01:03:01,667
- Have you checked in yet?
- Oh, no, I...

377
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:06,800
Let me take that. They´re gonna try and put you
in some kind of executive suite,

378
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,867
but the sound of the air-con
is gonna make you go crazy.

379
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:16,000
- I suggest room 18. Room 18 is very good.
- What room are you in?

380
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:21,800
- 19.
- I´ll sort myself out, thanks.

381
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:31,200
How did Luke´s case get so far?

382
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,533
- Have you met him?
- Yeah.

383
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:40,800
Two dead white teenage giris
in a crack house, a junky Brit,

384
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,733
no recall and a history of violence.

385
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:48,200
Even Luke´s original attorney
wanted him to plead guilty.

386
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:54,333
- He was a Falklands hero.
- Means shit here. Thanks.

387
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:59,333
What do you think of his chances
at the Supreme Court?

388
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:04,200
Well, the way I see it,
I think his challenge is pretty good.

389
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,400
You and I could be sipping champagne
by tomorrow night.

390
01:04:20,067 --> 01:04:25,400
<i>- Any luck with those enhancements?
- I´ll drop them off this afternoon.</i>

391
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:31,333
<i>Not at the Embassy. 17th and K, 2:00.</i>

392
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,467
<i>- Be there.
- Will do.</i>

393
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:03,133
Hey, guys.

394
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:08,267
Jesus!

395
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:19,400
Give me the tweezers. Thanks.

396
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,333
Bag this tooth.

397
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,267
- Hi.
- Thank you.

398
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,600
They´ve cleaned it out. There´s nothing there.

399
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,400
<i>- Did you find them?
- They´re missing.</i>

400
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,667
Yes.

401
01:09:20,867 --> 01:09:27,600
<i>I´ve got Azzam Sinclair on the phone.
He says it´s very important.</i>

402
01:09:36,533 --> 01:09:39,467
All right. Put him through.

403
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:45,933
<i>Hi, Azzam, it´s Mark. Happy birthday.
You having a good day?</i>

404
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:53,400
<i>- Yeah. Thank you for my present.
- It´s a pleasure. How´s my favourite godson?</i>

405
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,733
How many godsons have you got?

406
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:01,933
Just the one. Just you.

407
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,000
<i>So, are you enjoying Washington?</i>

408
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:15,267
<i>It´s okay. Dad´s pretty busy.
Are you coming over?</i>

409
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:20,933
<i>I can´t, I´m afraid. I´ve got a reception.</i>

410
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,733
<i>It´s pretty important.</i>

411
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:29,533
I´d like to meet you.

412
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:35,867
<i>You will, another time.</i>

413
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,333
Promise?

414
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:43,667
I promise.

415
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:02,933
Good boy.

416
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:34,800
Ambassador, may I present Gordon Adair,
CEO of Armitage Corporation.

417
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,267
Gordon, glad you could make it.

418
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:43,000
The DTI wanted to thank you
for bailing out Durmant Gas.

419
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,733
Well, we got an excellent price.

420
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:52,533
Look, good on you for going forward with
this tonight. You´re setting a fine example.

421
01:11:52,733 --> 01:11:55,667
Thank you.

422
01:11:55,867 --> 01:11:57,533
Hi.

423
01:11:57,733 --> 01:12:05,000
Ambassador, may I present Charles MacIntyre,
president of CMC Secure Operations.

424
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,667
Mr MacIntyre, the Ambassador.

425
01:12:07,867 --> 01:12:12,400
- Colonel, congratulations on your CBE.
- Thank you.

426
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,400
Good to see you.
I thought you´d be tied up in Baghdad.

427
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,333
Oh, I spend most of my time
now flying a desk.

428
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:24,600
You come over for lunch,
I´ll show you the new office.

429
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,200
- I look forward to it.
- Sir.

430
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:40,800
Ambassador, the US Secretary of Defense,
Lynne Warner.

431
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,200
Madam Secretary.

432
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,800
Thank you for coming at such
a difficult time.

433
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,600
Our enemies wish to render us asunder, Mark.
Instead, they bind us closer.

434
01:12:57,267 --> 01:12:59,867
In that spirit of friendship, Lynne,

435
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:07,600
it would be an honour if you would be
the first to sign our book of condolence.

436
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:15,467
The honour would be all mine.

437
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,467
- Secretary Warner!
- Madam Secretary, this way, please.

438
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:29,400
Just one moment...

439
01:13:33,133 --> 01:13:37,600
Secretary Warner,
just this way, please.

440
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,600
- Thank you!
- Madame Secretary.

441
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,867
Thank you.

442
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:50,600
Secretary Warner and the Brit Ambassador
united in sorrow.

443
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:57,867
- Nice going, Brocklehurst.
- I don´t know what you´re referring to, sir.

444
01:13:58,067 --> 01:14:04,067
But modesty compels me to admit,
it wasn´t my idea.

445
01:14:04,267 --> 01:14:07,000
Mmm-hmm.

446
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:12,000
Mark´s going to be a tough act to follow.

447
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:31,267
Colonel, how´s business?
Still peddling guns for diamonds.

448
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:38,733
Private security is a growth industry,
Nicholas, ask the Chancellor.

449
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,800
We´re thinking of floating the company.

450
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,800
You should buy some shares.
Bolster that public sector pensión of yours.

451
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:57,933
Under Secretary, do you know Charles MacIntyre,
CMC Secure Ops?

452
01:14:58,133 --> 01:15:01,067
Christopher Styles,
head of Defense Intelligence.

453
01:15:01,267 --> 01:15:04,000
We´ve met. Good to see you again, Colonel.

454
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,200
- Thank you.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

455
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:13,067
- Excuse me.
...pray silence for Sir Mark Brydon, KCMG,

456
01:15:13,267 --> 01:15:17,667
Her Majesty´s Ambassador to Washington.

457
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:25,533
I´d like to thank you all very much
for coming here this evening.

458
01:15:25,733 --> 01:15:33,000
These are frightening, uncertain times.

459
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,533
But it´s in adversity
we find our true friends.

460
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:43,400
And that´s why I´m especially pleased and
honoured to be able to welcome Lynne Warner,

461
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,133
Secretary of Defense
for the United States government.

462
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:57,067
May this gathering serve as a reminder
of the bonds that unite us today,

463
01:15:57,267 --> 01:16:03,867
will unite us tomorrow and
shall never be broken.

464
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,400
Madam Secretary.

465
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I thought long and hard
before coming tonight.

466
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:38,067
But yesterday´s events were a violent reminder
of the forces out there

467
01:16:38,267 --> 01:16:45,000
who wish to sabotage
not only the US democratic way of life,

468
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:52,133
but also our economic and commercial
interests throughout the worid.

469
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:56,000
I stand here tonight...

470
01:16:58,533 --> 01:17:04,333
...to give full warning to those
who wish to undermine us.

471
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:10,000
The people of America will not allow fear
to haunt their lives.

472
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:20,733
Wherever our rights and freedoms are threatened,
we will stop at nothing to defend ourselves.

473
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:29,800
The Governor of Virginia is rounding up all
British Muslims in his state and detaining them.

474
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,200
This is an illegal act, never mind
that it´s a breach of international law.

475
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:45,867
- It shows total disregard for basic human rights.
- That is for Congress to decide.

476
01:17:46,067 --> 01:17:52,000
As I understand, the Governor of Virginia
is acting under the powers of the Patriot Act.

477
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,333
We don´t even know who´s behind the attack.

478
01:17:55,533 --> 01:18:00,133
Pakistani fundamentalists,
Tyrgyztani Islamists, Saudi...

479
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:05,467
The bastard with his finger
on the button was British.

480
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:11,067
And from what I hear, they´re plenty more
queuing up right behind him.

481
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:14,467
Do you know how many British Muslims
there are in Virginia?

482
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:18,800
- It only takes one.
- At least 3,000.

483
01:18:20,267 --> 01:18:25,733
Holidaymakers, students,
business travellers, visa holders.

484
01:18:25,933 --> 01:18:30,467
You´re saying they´re all terrorist suspects?

485
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:36,800
- It´s an obscene act of racial discrimination.
- Obscene?

486
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:42,133
Ask the guys riding your subway
who´s being discriminated against

487
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:48,267
next time some wacko decides
to detonate himself.

488
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:53,067
I played along with your
little stunt out there, all right?

489
01:18:53,267 --> 01:19:00,067
All that hot air about strong bonds
and unity.

490
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:07,400
But my son did not die in Afghanistan
so that our so-called allies

491
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,467
could blow themselves up
in our own backyard.

492
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
If Governor Norris believes that these suspects
are a threat to the security of his citizens,

493
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,467
he has my 100º/% support.

494
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,467
Virginia authorities aren´t being
very cooperative,

495
01:19:52,667 --> 01:20:00,133
but it appears a rough estimate of 200 British
Muslims have been picked up across state.

496
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:09,733
They´re being moved to Fort Bird National Guard
Barracks, their passports are being confiscated.

497
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:17,533
- Give me the Governor´s number.
- He´s refusing to come to the phone.

498
01:20:17,733 --> 01:20:22,800
Too busy declaring a state of emergency.

499
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:37,000
What the hell? You´ll wake the building.

500
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,800
- What are you playing at?
- What am I playing at?

501
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,933
You´re the one that´s puffed up
like a cobra.

502
01:20:55,933 --> 01:21:04,467
Defense Intelligence, your department, leaked
intel that there was a Brit suicide bomber.

503
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:07,667
Do you have proof of that?

504
01:21:07,867 --> 01:21:13,733
Don´t play that game, not with me.
We´re in meltdown.

505
01:21:13,933 --> 01:21:18,333
You´ve got a xenophobic maniac
locking up British citizens.

506
01:21:18,533 --> 01:21:24,600
Governor Norris has every right to protect
the people who put him in power.

507
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,667
You´re deliberately fuelling anger.

508
01:21:28,867 --> 01:21:35,400
Now we´ve got a witch hunt.
You must know how dangerous that is.

509
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:42,067
Whatever your reasons,
they´d better be worth it.

510
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:51,600
Are you done now?

511
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,067
What do you want?

512
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:45,733
He didn´t do it. He didn´t do it.
He deserves better.

513
01:23:46,267 --> 01:23:52,467
- Who?
- Gardner, who do you think?

514
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,400
- Jane.
- He didn´t do it, all right?

515
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:01,933
Hey. Hey, you know that guy?

516
01:24:03,733 --> 01:24:07,000
Hey, buddy, don´t move.

517
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:38,333
<i>He accosted me in a dark car park.</i>

518
01:24:39,267 --> 01:24:47,133
- It could be construed as intimidation.
- Don´t blame me. I´m not responsible.

519
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:56,333
How come he´s so certain you´re innocent?
Could he be used as a witness?

520
01:24:56,533 --> 01:25:02,667
Look, death row cases attract the crazies,
all right.

521
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,333
Look, I´m trying to help you.

522
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:22,267
<i>You may know him.
He´s your age, heavyset, wired, scared.</i>

523
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:26,000
<i>... of Flight 113 took on
a new dimensión today...</i>

524
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,333
<i>He said you deserve better.</i>

525
01:25:29,533 --> 01:25:34,133
Well, I don´t know the bastard, all right.

526
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,667
<i>- The bomber of the Airbus was British...
- Time´s up.</i>

527
01:25:43,867 --> 01:25:49,467
Wait, wait! I was watching that!
Let me just watch it. Let me get...

528
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:52,467
- Open up!
- Just me have a look at it.

529
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:56,600
<i>... was also known as Ibrahim Wahid,</i>

530
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:03,800
<i>a terrorist with established connections
to groups close to Al-Qaeda.</i>

531
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,467
Think you´re gonna escape me, man?

532
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,533
It´s not gonna happen.

533
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,333
<i>... statement this morning,
Governor Norris stands by his belief</i>

534
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:06,933
<i>that the enforced detentions
are a necessary and correct response</i>

535
01:28:07,133 --> 01:28:12,000
<i>to protect the security
of the state of Virginia.</i>

536
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:16,333
<i>It´s gonna be another beautiful day
in the Lovers´ state,</i>

537
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:22,800
<i>but not for the 200 British Muslims
held at Fort Bird.</i>

538
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,400
<i>The British citizens were arrested
yesterday after the revelation</i>

539
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:36,200
<i>that the Flight 113 bomber was a British
Muslim by the name of Hassan Khan.</i>

540
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,067
<i>Governor Norris ordered them
to be taken to Fort Bird</i>

541
01:28:40,267 --> 01:28:43,267
<i>where they can be held for up
to seven days...</i>

542
01:28:43,467 --> 01:28:48,133
<i>- Oh, God, we´re going to be arrested.
...while the authorities decide</i>

543
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:52,267
<i>whether to deport them or
bring criminal charges.</i>

544
01:28:52,467 --> 01:28:56,000
<i>- There is chaos on the highways...
- We´ve got to get out of here.</i>

545
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,067
Don´t worry. Don´t worry.

546
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:03,067
- Please, Shahid, I don´t want to get...
- Whoa, whoa!

547
01:29:03,267 --> 01:29:08,467
- Stop, we´ll shoot!
- Stop the vehicle or we´ll shoot!

548
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:10,667
Stop!

549
01:29:39,067 --> 01:29:45,333
Sir Mark Brydon, British Ambassador.
Nasreen Qureshi, Press Secretary.

550
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,400
The police made some calls.

551
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:44,267
They told friends they were frightened
they´d be rounded up.

552
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:47,067
They were trying to get to Maryland.

553
01:30:47,267 --> 01:30:51,400
- How old were they?
- 25 and 24.

554
01:30:55,733 --> 01:31:01,600
- She was three months pregnant.
- Jesus Christ!

555
01:31:08,733 --> 01:31:13,667
Right, make sure the names don´t go out
until the family´s been informed.

556
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:16,067
Right.

557
01:31:16,267 --> 01:31:21,800
<i>Whilst admitting the deaths
of these young people was a tragic accident,</i>

558
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,600
<i>Governor Norris says he plans to stand by
his decisión to detain the British Muslims.</i>

559
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:37,400
<i>Civil liberty organisations across the US
are petitioning the President</i>

560
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,533
<i>against the legality
of the Governor´s actions.</i>

561
01:31:41,733 --> 01:31:49,000
<i>The Secretary of State and the Attorney
General are scheduled to meet later today.</i>

562
01:32:17,067 --> 01:32:26,067
<i>- Hello, Mark Brydon.
- Hi, I wasn´t sure you´d be awake. It´s Caroline.</i>

563
01:32:27,267 --> 01:32:32,133
<i>Hi. Is everything all right?</i>

564
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:38,267
<i>I was wondering
if there´s anything I can do.</i>

565
01:32:39,133 --> 01:32:47,267
<i>I´ve been talking to our contact in Islamabad.
There´s a lot of resentment on the streets.</i>

566
01:32:47,467 --> 01:32:50,733
<i>Yeah, I´m not surprised.</i>

567
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:00,133
<i>- Can´t you sleep?
- No.</i>

568
01:33:13,067 --> 01:33:15,600
Scotch, please.

569
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:29,467
Dad´s cup´s still on the kitchen counter.

570
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:35,600
If I hadn´t rushed him,
if we´d stayed talking to you...

571
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:42,333
It´s not your fault.

572
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,467
He never could say goodbye.

573
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,467
He´d just hug me and dash off.

574
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,800
Would you sleep with me tonight?

575
01:34:25,867 --> 01:34:29,733
Sorry. I just wanted...

576
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:40,200
I don´t know...
Mean anything, you´re leaving and...

577
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:48,133
Does everybody know?

578
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,467
This is Washington, Mark.

579
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:09,600
I think you´re lovely,

580
01:35:11,733 --> 01:35:17,067
but I really don´t think
we should do this tonight.

581
01:35:19,133 --> 01:35:21,333
Mmm.

582
01:35:21,533 --> 01:35:27,067
- You´d hate yourself in the morning.
- Mmm-hmm.

583
01:35:28,267 --> 01:35:30,067
Yeah.

584
01:36:41,933 --> 01:36:47,600
The best thing to do isn´t always
the right thing.

585
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:54,733
That´s self-serving bullshit.The same bullshit
that got Usman elected in the first place.

586
01:36:54,933 --> 01:37:01,333
- One incident, there will be wide-spread arrests.
- Well, get the rest of them inside the compound.

587
01:37:01,533 --> 01:37:04,867
God damn it! I kept that man in power.

588
01:37:05,067 --> 01:37:08,933
Their flight plan says they´re on route
to Tyrgyztan.

589
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:13,267
Call everyone in. We need to be on top
of this before Washington wakes up.
