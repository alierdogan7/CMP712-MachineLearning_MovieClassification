It is all very well to criticize others.

If they had agreed to act,

33
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,775

would have been frustrated

for you must protect us
against these pagans.

44
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,302
Your Highness, it is still not too
late for you to leave the city.

45
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,871
Many here would urge
you to save yourself.

46
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,540
Surely,

47
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,309
they would blame me for abandoning

48
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,878
our capital at such a time?

49
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,481
Perhaps they would think it
is a sensible precaution.

50
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,456
Allow me a moment to reflect, Count Odo.

52

Count Odo thinks it might be
a good idea for me to leave.

53
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:24,422
You must tell Count Odo that you have
no intention of abandoning your people.

54
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,023
That whatever happens,

55

These next few days and weeks

I carry this burden with a light heart,

72
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,208
knowing I share it with our Lord,
and with your Highness.

73
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,112
But I must ask your Highness
if you have appealed to

74
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,882
your brother,
the Eastern Emperor, for help?

75
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,184
He could surely provide
an army for our relief.

76
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:03,621
I will not ask either
of my brothers for help.

77
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,926
I must prove myself better
than my brothers, Count Odo,

78
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,331
and these Northmen have
provided the opportunity.

79
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,136
Defeat them,

80
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,972

84
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,622
that your burden is...

00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,294

What would she think if we
decided to overthrow him?

186
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,524
King Ragnar, we have reached Paris.

187
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,392
Now...

188
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,541
- Now, we all want to know...
- Puh, puh, puh, puh...

189
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:50,863
The king...

190
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:54,600
my oldest friend has
asked me to take command.

191
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,144
So...

192
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,415
How do we best attack the city?

193
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:12,285
(CLEARS THROAT)

194
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,193
Some of us...

195
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,362
have taken a closer look
at the city from further up the bank.

196
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,998
And we suggest a plan.

197
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:31,337
To mount simultaneous attacks both
from the water and from the land.

198
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,263
LAGERTHA: I will lead an assault on
the tower and the gates of the city.

199
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:35,525
We will attack the gates together.

200
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,410
LAGERTHA:
I said I would lead the assault.

201
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,961
We may need the tools Erlendur made.

202
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,631
I will make that decision,
if and when we need to make it.

203
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:43,299
I trust Earl Kalf to make it.

204
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,051
I don't think you were listening.

205
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:51,669
At the same time as the
attack at the gates,

206
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,809
there will also be

207
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:54,727
a river-borne attack.

208
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,946
The ships will be filled with
warriors and means of scaling,

209
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,481
we will beach beneath the walls.

210
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:01,200
We will climb up and gain entry
to the city that way as well.

211
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,405
In which case, Floki,
you will be responsible for constructing

212
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:09,242
whatever it is we need
to scale these walls.

213
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:12,745
(SNICKERS) Oh, don't you worry
about me, Rollo.

214
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,414
I will make something truly astonishing.

215
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,833
Just wait and see.

216
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,754
All those who agree with the plan,
say aye.

217
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,091
ALL:
Aye!

218
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:26,426
Aye.

Take my baby.

What are you talking about?

225
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,226
I cannot care for her.

226
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,011
Of course you can.

227
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:35,796
I can't.

228
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,365
I want her to be like your sons.

229
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,401
I want her to be Viking.

What does it matter
what you call someone?

231
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,994
Whether she's Viking
or not Viking is not important.

232
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,781
What is important is that
you love and nurture her.

233
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,984
For if you are fortunate,
she will grow up healthy.

234
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,086
And give you grandchildren
to be proud of.

Bjorn loves you.

Bjorn will be much happier

She needs her mother.

But it is not to be helped.

And even when we are dealt with harshly,

253
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,057
remember, it is the gods who
have woven our destinies.

254
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,993
Not ourselves.

My son.

256
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,539
I have another mission
for you on our behalf.

257
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,543
You must go to Mercia and
persuade Queen Kwenthrith

258
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,796
that her interests and
ours are one and the same.

259
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,915
She has killed six of our nobles.

260
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,519
Yes.

261
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,421
That is certainly...

262
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,222
unfortunate.

263
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,725
And she ought to be punished.

264
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:47,428
So much for gratitude.

265
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,531
What kind of a world do we live in,

266
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,233
when the friends of our friends,
kill our friends?

267
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,509
But still, there is a way for this
deluded Queen to find some redemption.

268
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,245
There is?

269
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,984
My son,

270
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:13,921
Mercia has been weakened
by years of civil wars.

271
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,759
She is no longer what she was,
and must acknowledge the power of Wessex.

272
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,528
Without Wessex,
Mercia is now more than ever

273
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:23,664
at the mercy of the Northmen.

274
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,333
As well as other Saxon neighbors.

275
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,535
Like Northumbria?

276
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:31,338
Precisely. Like Northumbria.

277
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:33,741
Yes.

278
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:36,977
Those closest, but unexpected,
can sow a terrible harvest.

279
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:41,899
I charge you to go to Mercia.

280
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:46,253
And tell the Queen that she may be
forgiven for slaughtering our nobles

281
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:51,608
but only if she begs mercy and
reconfirms her subjugation to Wessex.

282
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:52,694
If not,

283
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,462
we will show her the iron fist.

284
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,532
We will invade and we will destroy her,

285
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:03,837
and her limbs being fastened to four
horses, her body will be torn apart.

286
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:10,310
Or something of that sort.

287
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:14,348
But also tell her that we have
a repugnance for such measures,

288
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,749
being Christians.

289
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,019
Torvi...

290
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,127
Torvi, I should have spoken before.

291
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:01,496
Why?

292
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,836
You know why.

293
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:11,371
It doesn't matter.

294
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:15,309
I am not with child,
neither am I a child.

295
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,846
I took advantage.

296
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:20,514
So did I.

297
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,289
Uh...

298
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,027
This is for you.

299
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,143
What's that?

300
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,211
Nothing.

301
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,930
- Let me see!
- No.

302
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,198
You are hurting me.

303
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,488
It's far too good for you.

304
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:02,757
Whore.

305
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:21,113
ODO: The Northmen have been scouting
the countryside, and our defenses.

306
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:23,315
We must expect an attack any day now.

00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,417
EMPORER CHARLES:
Gisla,

308
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,985
I regret not sending
you to safety in time.

309
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,422
It is much on my mind.

310
00:25:30,524 --> 00:25:32,390
I did not want to be sent away.

311
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:34,526
I wanted to stay here with you.

312
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:37,429
There is nowhere I would
rather be than here in Paris,

313
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:39,331
beside you, in your hour of need.

314
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,800
But I must tell you both,

315
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:44,136
I have been much about the city.

316
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:47,606
The people of Paris are frightened
to death by this pagan army.

317
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,876
So far, only their firm belief
in god's grace and protection,

318
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:53,612
prevents them from becoming
hysterical and violent.

319
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:56,081
I am aware of the need to pacify
and control the population.

320
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:58,450
Thank you, Princess Gisla.

321
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:00,852
Perhaps you yourself might
help to reassure them

322
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:04,723
that we are well-protected, and have
enough supplies to withstand a long siege.

323
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,725
Though, god willing,
it will not come to that.

324
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:09,027
You may rely upon me to
do everything possible to

325
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:11,530
persuade the people of
our ultimate victory.

326
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,832
Even your presence in the city,
Princess,

327
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,700
helps them to believe in that.

328
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,537
Yet it is for my father to
lead us to that victory.

329
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:20,772
Is it not, father?

330
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:29,147
I must to bed.

331
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,334
I am tired.

332
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,788
But I am glad we have
had this conversation,

333
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,660
and I am also very glad that I have
placed my faith in you, Count Odo,

334
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:45,514
as well as in God Almighty,

335
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,667
for the successful
outcome of this matter.

336
00:26:58,128 --> 00:26:59,327
I must too go to bed.

337
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,213
Of course.

338
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:05,033
And yet I beg you to stay
a moment and listen to me.

339
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,753
You once refused my offer of marriage.

340
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:16,578
What had I achieved?
What could I offer you?

341
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:19,564
But then I heard how many other
offers of marriage you had declined,

342
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:22,534
from men far richer,
far grander than me, and...

343
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,170
So, it gave me hope.

344
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:29,741
And my hope is that once I have
successfully managed the defense of Paris,

345
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:32,244
and the defeat of the Northmen, and...

346
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:34,613
gained a new and high reputation,

347
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:37,515
you will look again at my proposal?

348
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:41,269
If you save Paris,

349
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:43,021
I will forever be in your debt.

350
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:46,691
But your first duty, Count Odo,

351
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:49,311
is to concentrate on the
defeat of the Northmen.

352
00:27:50,564 --> 00:27:52,330
On that, I am sure we both agree.

353
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,256
FLOKI:
Higher up.

354
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:39,911
FLOKI: Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be more at an angle.

355
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:46,451
You must be hungry.
I have brought you something to eat.

356
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:47,536
I'm not hungry.

357
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:49,187
My work nourishes me.

358
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,191
I have so many responsibilities now,
Helga.

359
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,760
Everyone is depending on me.

360
00:28:55,846 --> 00:28:59,264
My inventions will
allow us to enter Paris.

361
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:00,498
