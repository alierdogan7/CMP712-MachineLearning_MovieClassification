1
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,328
[Arguing and commotion]

2
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,729
Man: Gentlemen,
gentlemen, please.

3
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,932
Now, if we start
the encirclement
in this sector

4
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,334
and maneuver the enemy's troops

5
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,336
out of the central
defense lines,

6
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,938
why, the counterattack
must be successful.

7
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,939
Second man:
That stinks!

8
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,040
I beg your pardon.

9
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,342
Walter Winchell
said last night--

10
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,343
will you listen to me?

11
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:18,345
Now, here are the Nazis.

12
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,679
So what have they got, tanks?

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,581
So what's a tank?

14
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,549
In '29,
they used 'em in Chicago.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,950
Armored cars.

16
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,685
You're living in the past.

17
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:26,487
The layout's a cinch.

18
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:27,554
Remember how Willie's mob

19
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,688
mowed down those West Side boys?

20
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,623
I'll never forget it!

21
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,158
That's how the British
should do it.

22
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,259
Now...

23
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,361
The fleet muscles in
at this spot,

24
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,095
we hijack their ammunition,

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,097
the R.A.F.
Spits on Berlin,

26
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,066
and we catch them
with their panzers down.

27
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,334
[Laughter]

28
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,102
The way you're doing it,
we'll lose the war.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,404
What?

30
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,972
You're backing us right
into another Dunkirk.

31
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,908
Smart guy, where'd you
learn to be a general,
in the Bronx?

32
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,512
I've served some of
the greatest authorities
of our times, to wit:

33
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,114
Gunther, Kaltenborn,
Raymond, Graham, swing.

34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,649
Listen, four-eyes,

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,585
if you don't keep
quiet, I'll serve you
with a blackout.

36
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,387
20 years.

37
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:00,388
Take those glasses off

38
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,488
and I'll pop you in the nose.

39
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,989
Oh, yeah? Don't let
that stop you.

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,991
I don't need the glasses.

41
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:05,992
Where's everybody?

42
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:06,993
[Laughter]

43
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,994
Where are you, fellas?

44
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,162
Wait a minute, sunshine.

45
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:09,997
I think
the general's
got a point.

46
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:11,130
What point?!

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,532
When you take into consideration

48
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,800
the carastan
on the tagabrue
with dive bombers--

49
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,868
I told you
that the fleet
muscles in here,

50
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,737
the R.A.F.--

51
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,172
what did you say?

52
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:22,141
I said the Carastan
on the tagabrue is
a very serious problem.

53
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,943
To say nothing of
the larrisanc Faye.

54
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,077
Cut out the double talk,

55
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,246
and don't camouflage
your ignorance.

56
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,614
Listen, we know just as much

57
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,549
about doping out
this war as you do,
ignoramus.

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,418
Ignoramus? I'll shove
a tank down your throat.

59
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,152
I'll stab you
with this--

60
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,154
man: Here comes the boss.

61
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,557
Hey, what's going on here?

62
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,891
Man: Hello, boss.
How are you?

63
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,127
I could hear you boys
clear down to 42nd street.

64
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,462
Hey, what is all this?

65
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,163
A few things
I picked up at
the five-and-ten.

66
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,298
Second childhood, huh?

67
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,566
This character
thinks he's an expert

68
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,134
on the international situation.

69
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,337
Just showing the boys
how England can win
the war, Gloves.

70
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,306
I'll arrange
a conference between
you and Churchill.

71
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,775
Now let's get down
to serious business.

72
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,677
Serious business?

73
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,311
This is serious business,
Gloves.

74
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,679
Don't you think it's time
you got your mind

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,781
out of the sports section
and onto the front page?

76
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,583
I can't be bothered.

77
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,783
That's Washington's racket.

78
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,817
Let them handle it.

79
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,586
Now, will the ambassador
from Belmont park

80
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,855
kindly give me a report
on the racing situation?

81
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,057
I clocked sweet dream
this morning at 1:40.

82
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,058
Yeah? What's
the morning line?

83
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,059
3 to 1.

84
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,294
5 grand on the schnoz.

85
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,195
Caught kid O'Brien's
workout this morning.

86
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,196
How's his left?

87
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,197
Like a machine gun.

88
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,798
10 grand he wins in 3 rounds.

89
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,199
10 grand on O'Brien?

90
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,468
What's the matter with O'Brien?

91
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,602
Nothing.
I like him.

92
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,003
I also like my mother,

93
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,605
but she can't fight, either.

94
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,206
Bring me my coffee
and cheesecake, Louie.

95
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,776
Yes, Mr. Donahue.
Right away, sir.

96
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,080
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

97
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,615
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

98
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,818
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

99
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,621
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

100
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,823
Cheesecake
for Mr. Donahue.

101
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,825
We have a problem.

102
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,760
No cheesecake?

103
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,495
Plenty, but not from
Miller's bakery.

104
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:49,662
What are we going to do?

105
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,364
He only likes it
from Miller's bakery.

106
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,632
Give him the
national cheesecake.

107
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,233
It's a reasonable facsimile.

108
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,635
I wouldn't advise it.

109
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,838
You wouldn't know
the difference.

110
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,455
Sunshine:
Incidentally,

111
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,656
Samson is
twirling for the
tigers today.

112
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,258
Incidentally, Samson's
got a glass arm.

113
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,660
Here you are,
Mr. Donahue.

114
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,261
Put 5 yards on the yanks.

115
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,663
5 yards
on the yanks.
OK, boss.

116
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,365
You better get those bets down.

117
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,567
Man: Hi, boys!

118
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,768
Hi, fellas.

119
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,769
Hiya, Barney.

120
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,604
Hello, coach.

121
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,771
I got the money from Callahan.

122
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,606
Did he give easy?

123
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,773
Just like extracting a molar.

124
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,675
Any message?

125
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:35,775
Should I leave out
the curse words?

126
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,677
No message.

127
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:37,678
Dry cleaner--
what'd he say?

128
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:38,945
He says he ain't no welsher,

129
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,080
but in his opinion
the taxi bet was a frame.

130
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,417
He says 4 even license numbers
in a row just don't happen
to come along.

131
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,285
Hey, there's a miracle
on 48th street.

132
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,620
He's got a nerve,
accusing us of bribery.

133
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,621
Ain't he, though?

134
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,856
Here, pay off those hackies,

135
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,424
and tell 'em it was nice timing.

136
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,959
After that, coach,
can I beat it?

137
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,694
No, you got to drive us
out to the ballpark.

138
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,295
Can't I skip the ball game?

139
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,296
I got a date with a doll.

140
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,698
Bring her along.

141
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,166
We got something planned.

142
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,302
Anything you're going to do
you can do at the ballpark.

143
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,905
I don't think so.

144
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,078
Hey, Louie.

145
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,312
Yes, Mr. Donahue.

146
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,714
When I order cheesecake,

147
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,449
I don't expect to get mucilage.

148
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,717
I'm sorry,
Mr. Donahue, but--

149
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,452
this is not Miller's cheesecake.

150
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,788
He didn't come today
yet...Today.

151
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,789
Why not?

152
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,890
We don't know.

153
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,358
There's a new invention
called the telephone.

154
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,493
You could've used it.

155
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,327
Let me get you
something else maybe.

156
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,996
A nice French doughnut
oozin' with jelly?

157
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,433
You tell Charlie
to take his cheesecake
from Miller's only...

158
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,667
Or else.

159
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,835
Wait a minute,
Mr. Donahue.
Can't you--

160
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,805
cut out the arguments.
Can't you read?

161
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,074
Who's smokin'?

162
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,344
Flowers?

163
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,446
Oh, hello, Herman.

164
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,147
Hello, gents,
you are not leaving?

165
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,349
I got a business engagement
at Yankee stadium.

166
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,351
But you didn't have
your cheesecake yet.

167
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,453
I haven't got time for that now.

168
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,354
I'll have two
for supper tonight.

169
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,488
What happened to you?

170
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,223
Oh, nothing, nothing.

171
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,091
I got a little pain in my back.

172
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,292
Aw, that's too bad.

173
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,761
See Dr. Lachelle and
tell him I sent you.

174
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,362
Oh, say, you going
to see my old lady?

175
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,363
Naturally.

176
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,532
Well, here, give her this.

177
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,566
Tell her if I make
out good at the game

178
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,367
she's got herself a new sable.

179
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,368
Here you are, Lottie.

180
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,369
Thank you.

181
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,971
Here, buy yourself a yacht.

182
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,574
Thanks, Gloves.

183
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,776
You done a good job, boys.

184
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,946
Hey, Gloves,
won't you please
reconsider my request?

185
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,114
This date is personally
important to me.

186
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,382
See the dame tomorrow.

187
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,784
But I'm aging fast!

188
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,988
I want to take
advantage of my youth.

189
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,004
Whoa.

190
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,407
Woman: Mr. Miller.

191
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,409
Hello, Mrs. Donahue.

192
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,844
Did you see my son?

193
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,845
Yes.

194
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,846
How is he?

195
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:54,914
Fine, fine!

196
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,549
Any circles under his eyes?

197
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,150
I didn't see any.

198
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,385
For you.

199
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,453
For me?

200
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,289
Oh, no! Ain't that
sweet of him?

201
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,058
I'll be down in a few minutes.

202
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,027
Thank you, Mrs. Helen.
Come again.

203
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,630
Good day.

204
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:11,832
Hello, Anna.

205
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,833
Oh, it's good you came back.

206
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:18,038
I promised Mrs. Schulz
this birthday cake
for half-past 2:00.

207
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Anna.

208
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,909
Yes?

209
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,843
There's somebody here to see me?

210
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,444
No. Do you
expect anybody?

211
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,714
No, no. I was
just asking.

212
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:28,715
Herman, what's the matter?

213
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,782
Is anything wrong?

214
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,851
No, no. You go
deliver the cake.

215
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,854
I will talk to you
when you come back.

216
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,056
There's something
I have to tell you.

217
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,057
Herman?

218
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,660
Don't worry.

219

[Man humming]

220
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,067
Thank you.

[Resumes humming]

222
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,742
Hello, papa Miller,
how is everything?

223
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,209
[Sharply]
Hello.

224
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,878
[Mimicking]
Hello.

225
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,479
You're not very polite today.

226
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,882
You didn't ask me how I am.

227
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,484
Look!
The candies I like.

228
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,486
I'll have a few.
You don't mind?

229
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,088
Have some popcorn?

230
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,089
No.

231
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,390
No? No.

232
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,894
See, papa Miller,
you have been a very
busy man lately.

233
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,963
I've been watching
for you all morning.

234
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:17,898
Deliveries.

235
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,498
A man must make a living.

236
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,533
Of course.

237
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,102
But I must make a living, too.

238
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,606
Excuse me, I have
some work to do.

239
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,978
[Man begins humming]

240
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,515
Tell me, papa Miller,
were you down at the pier
this morning?

241
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,317
You know I go to
the pier every morning.

242
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,787
Then you got
the information
from Schiller?

243
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,521
No.

244
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,824
Oh, you didn't?

245
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,595
No. I won't do this
kind of work anymore.

246
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:51,131
You won't?

247
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,902
Perhaps you need
a little encouragement.

248
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,304
You don't frighten me.

249
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,741
Frighten you?

250
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,676
I didn't want to frighten you.

251
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,277
I merely wanted to warn you.

252
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,948
You see, tonight's job
is very, very important.

253
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,150
I don't care.
I won't do it.

254
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,484
I thought it over.

255
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,586
You are criminals,

256
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,955
murderers. I won't
have any part--

257
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,960
perhaps now you'll
change your mind.

258
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,096
No. You can beat me.
You can do whatever
you want,

259
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,699
but I won't do it,
and I won't let
you do it.

260
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,967
I'll stop all of you.

261
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,035
I will tell the police.

262
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,038
I will tell everybody.

263
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,184
No!

264
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,224
This is very exasperating.

265
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,592
A man on first,
a man on second,
a man on third,

266
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,127
2 out, 3 balls and 2 strikes,

267
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,595
and we have to leave the game.

268
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,596
Why?

269
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,597
Yeah, why?

270
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,732
I don't know,

271
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,167
but my old lady
says it's urgent...

272
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,602
In unison: And when she says
it's urgent, it's urgent.

273
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,204
You gonna be long, coach?

274
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,006
What do you care?

275
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,473
Somebody's waitin' for me.

276
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,176
And that's urgent, too.

277
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,021
Hello, mom.
What's the trouble?

278
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,023
Hello, son,
I am glad you're here.

279
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,591
I got here as quick as I could.

280
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,093
I hated to call you
from the ball game,
but he isn't here.

281
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,094
Who isn't here?

282
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,195
Mr. Miller.

283
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,430
I just saw him
a little while ago
downtown.

284
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,633
I know! It's just as
if the earth opened up
and swallowed him.

285
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,634
Yeah?
Where's Mrs. Miller?

286
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,236
She's inside.
Come on.

287
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,805
You boys wait out here.

288
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,407
[Woman crying]

289
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,643
Hello, Mrs. Miller.

290
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,645
Now, now, Mrs. Miller,
stop crying.

291
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,780
We'll find Herman for you.

292
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:48,881
There's nothing to worry about.

293
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,082
That's what I told her.

294
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,051
No, no.

295
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:53,652
Something's happened.
I'm sure of it.

296
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,654
Maybe he just took a walk
around the block.

297
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,655
No, no!

298
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,257
When did you last see him?

299
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,059
Just after lunch.

300
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,226
Yes, just after lunch.

301
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,061
Mrs. Miller went out
for a few minutes,

302
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,230
and I come down
to get the flowers
you'd sent me,

303
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,032
and he was gone.

304
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,265
Anybody see him leave?

305
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,067
No! Johnny
was standing
right out there

306
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,536
by his popcorn stand
the whole time.

307
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,537
And he never saw him come out.

308
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,538
And the back door was locked

309
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,639
from the inside.

310
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,941
Did he say anything
or do anything

311
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,408
to make you think he
might be in trouble?

312
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,409
Oh, well...

313
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,410
No!

314
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,678
Why would he be in trouble?

315
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,713
Sure he never
harmed a person--

316
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,081
mom, will you
let Mrs. Miller

317
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,549
answer my questions, please?

318
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,684
Well, he did say
there was something

319
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,686
he wanted to tell me
when I got back.

320
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,921
People don't
just disappear
for no reason.

321
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,122
Well, I don't know.

322
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,825
Now, now,
Mrs. Miller,
don't you cry.

323
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,093
We'll find him for you.

324
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,527
Anybody search the place?

325
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,829
Why, sure we've looked around.

326
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,097
We didn't see a sign of him.

327
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,698
Come on, we'll search the joint.

328
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,867
Sure, we got time to burn.

329
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,868
Let's go up the attic,

330
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,269
down in the basement.

331
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,837
We'll start
in the basement
and work our way up.

332
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,105
Maybe we can find a clue.

333
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,240
You'll see, Mrs. Miller,
my boy'll find him.

334
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,709
I'm a promoter, mom.
I'm not J. Edgar hoover.

335
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,244
I hope nothing's
happened to him.

336
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,246
Oh.

337
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,184
What do you make of it?

338
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,086
I had an uncle once
who used to disappear
like this,

339
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,289
and every time they'd
find him in Atlantic city
with a dame named Clarissa.

340
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,292
You know I'm only
doing this to satisfy
my old lady.

341
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,293
Your old lady.

342
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,961
All I know is every
time we get settled

343
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,296
at the race track,
the ball game,
or the prize fight,

344
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,398
she has to call up
and disturb us.

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,333
Why don't you
get her a penthouse
on park Avenue

346
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,334
and isolate her?

347
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,269
I tried that once,

348
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,736
but she likes
the old neighborhood.

349
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,138
All her pals are down here.

350
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,740
There's nothing here.
Let's go.

What's the matter, pussy?

354
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,318
That's a nice cat.

355

Come here, pussy.

356
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,759
How about that?

359
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,766
I can't figure it.

360
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,835
A nice old gent like Miller.

361
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:49,902
Who would want to knock him off?

362
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,770
I hope this isn't a clue...

363
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,772
Because I just swallowed it.

364
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,174
...waiting here
a whole hour.

365
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,575
Say, chief, can't I get away

366
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,177
just long enough
to give my girl
a quick hello?

367
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,578
Stick around, will you?

368
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,647
What are you
so nervous about?
She'll keep.

369
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,781
That's what you think.

370
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,016
I can't take a chance.

371
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,784
The fleet's in,
and she's defense-minded.

372
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,454
Come on, Romeo, get out of here.

373
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,190
Well, mom,
how's Mrs. Miller?

374
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,793
Oh, how can she be?
We've got to find out
who did this.

375
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,795
Why, he never harmed
a person in his life.

376
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,797
There, now, now,
this won't do any good.

377
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,832
You'll make yourself sick.

378
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,400
We'll let the cops handle this.

379
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,801
That's their business.

380
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,537
Woman: Excuse me.

381
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,811
I'd...I'd like to see
Mr. Miller, please.

382
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,047
I'm sorry, sister.

383
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,815
He--he ain't here.

384
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,885
Oh. Do you know where
I can find him?

385
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,819
What do you want
to see him about?

386
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,924
Well, it--it's personal.

387
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,825
You're too late.

388
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,827
He was found dead
a half an hour ago.

389
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,828
Dead?

390
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,829
Murdered.

391
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,764
Oh, Gloves.

392
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,566
I want to talk to you.

393
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,968
Just a minute.

394
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,836
What the...

395
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,006
Officer:
Not so fast, Donahue.

396
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:03,109
Just where do you
think you're going?

397
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,911
I was just standing
here talking to a dame,

398
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,378
and I turned around,
and she's gone.

399
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,114
Even with a murderer
around you have to
talk to dames.

400
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,582
Don't tell me there's
a new city ordinance
against that.

401
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,951
You just be available.

402
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,185
The D.A. Will want
to know your version
of this.

403
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,720
Hey, what are you trying to do,

404
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,721
get me mixed up in this?

405
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,056
Miller was a friend of mine.

406
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,390
I've been eating
his cheesecake
for 10 years.

407
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,926
I'm just up here
trying to help
the community.

408
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,429
Just make sure
you don't leave
the community.

409
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,631
How about that?

410
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,600
Don't forget
the policeman's ball
ain't so far off.

411
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,804
Son, did you notice
anything peculiar
about that girl?

412
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,839
Peculiar?

413
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,207
She does a great vanishing act,

414
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,342
if that's what you mean.

415
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,210
Yes, why did she
run away like that?

416
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,711
Maybe she was scared.

417
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,613
The puss on that
lieutenant's enough
to scare anybody.

418
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,816
No. I've seen her
here before talking
to Mr. Miller.

419
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:45,817
So what?

420
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,219
That girl knows something.

421
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,488
Aw, now, ma,
you can't suspect
everybody

422
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,790
that comes into
the bakery to buy
a loaf a bread.

423
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,159
Yes, but there's
something--

424
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,927
sunshine: What do you want
him to do, Mrs. Donahue,

425
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,629
spend the rest of his
life trying to find out
who killed cock Robbin?

426
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,431
No! But as sure as--

427
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,432
I know how you feel,

428
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,968
but let's be sensible
about this.

429
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,235
Let the cops handle it.

430
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,637
You go on home
and buy yourself
a new hat.

431
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,240
And here's a couple
of hundred bucks
for Mrs. Miller.

432
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,841
If she needs any more,
let me know.

433
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,077
So long, mom.

434
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,344
Good-bye, son.

435
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,447
Gloves:
All right, Barney,
drive me home.

436
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:24,456
Say, Johnny, did you see
a girl come out of here
a few minutes ago?

437
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,125
Excuse me, boss.

438
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,826
Hey, Saratoga.

439
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:28,860
Yes, sir.

440
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,662
Isn't that my tie you got on?

441
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,663
Yes, sir.

442
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,831
And my shirt?

443
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,899
Yes, sir.

444
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,167
What are you doing with my belt?

445
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,668
You don't
want your pants
to fall down,

446
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,669
do you, boss?

447
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,071
I'll talk to you later.

448
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,706
Yes, sir.

449
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,707
Hey, where's Barney?

450
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,009
I don't know.

451
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,243
He took a run
out after we
left the bakery.

452
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,277
I think
he's got ants
in his romance.

453
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,878
Get him for me, will you?

454
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,480
Sunshine: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

455
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,548
Sunshine...

456
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,882
I got something hot
at the end of the wire.

457
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,884
Yeah?
Cowboys from Wyoming?

458
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,286
All right, all right.

459
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,622
How much have they got
in traveler's checks?

460
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,623
20 grand, at least.

461
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,591
Listen, tell Gloves

462
00:15:58,592 --> 00:15:59,891
this is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

463
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,760
It's their first trip
to New York.

464
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:01,761
The sky's the limit,

465
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:02,762
and they're raring to go.

466
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,296
OK, Spats, keep 'em on ice.

467
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,298
Your apartment in an hour.

468
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,700
I just staked a claim
to a gold mine.

469
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,303
Spats dug up a couple
of Wyoming types in town
on a convention.

470
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,505
They would like
to spend a nice,
sociable evening

471
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,906
playing tiddlywinks.

472
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,908
I hope they're good losers.

473
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,510
I'll make sure.
I'll bring my deck.

474
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,379
[Telephone rings]

475
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,514
For whom do the bells toll now?

476
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,416
Yeah?

477
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,184
Hello, let me talk to Gloves.

478
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,418
This is Marty Callahan.

479
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,920
Callahan?
What do you want?

480
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,322
Just a minute.

481
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,325
Mr. Callahan would like
to converse with you.

482
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,094
Yeah, what is it, obnoxious?

483
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,730
Hello, Gloves, say,
what are you trying to do,
put me out of business?

484
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,432
I run
an ultra-high-class
joint here,

485
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,000
and if you think
you can drag me into
some murder rap--

486
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,537
what? Wait a minute,
translate that into
English, will you?

487
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,905
What? Who?

488
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,474
Your old lady.
Your mother.

489
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,009
She's down here
crabbing my whole
setup with some beef

490
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,012
about some guy named
Miller, some bakery,
some murder rap.

491
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,947
Now, look,
if you don't come down
and get her out of here,

492
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,349
I ain't gonna be
responsible, see?

493
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,551
OK, OK. Don't have
a nervous breakdown.

494
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,686
I'll be right over.

495
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,054
Here, get me out of this.

496
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,290
Yes, sir.

497
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,957
What's up, I'm afraid?

498
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,093
We're going to the duchess club.

499
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,360
This is no time
for a rumba lesson.

500
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,561
It isn't a rumba,
it's my mother.

501
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,363
Your mother?

502
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,364
What's she doing there?

503
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,398
Maybe if we're lucky,

504
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,565
she's dug up another dead body.

505
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,566
[Knock on door]

506
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,967
Hiya, coach.

507
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,069
I did it, I did it.

508
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,370
Annabelle and me
just got married.

509
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,971
I'm the happiest man
in the world.

510
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,240
Congratulations.
Come on.

511
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,374
But, coach, I and the bride

512
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,375
want to go on a short honeymoon.

513
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,576
Next month, Casanova.

514
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,378
Sorry, miss.

515
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,578
I'm sorry, honey.

Don't worry, miss,
things ain't always as
black as they looks.

522
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,992
Mrs. Donahue:
I can stay here
if I want to,

523
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,594
and I want to stay here!

getting all my customers
conscience-stricken,

Ain't I got enough
trouble with you?

530
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,836
Do I have to have your mother?

531
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,671
I'm warning you,
don't start up
with my son.

I'm telling you
and your son both

533
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,307
I don't know any guy
named Miller.

534
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,408
I don't know nothin'
about any murder,

535
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,210
and stop upsettin'
my Prima Donna.

536
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,412
Be sweet, will you?
Will you scram?

537
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,080
All right, Marty, all right.

538
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,151
Gee, ma, what are
you doing down here
at this time of the night?

539
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,752
Don't be angry with me, son.

540
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,019
But that girl's here.

541
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,054
What girl?

542
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,456
The one who came to the bakery.

543
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,990
My star performer
don't go in no
cheap bakeries.

544
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,559
That's what you think.

545
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,027
Now, if you talk
to her, you'll find out
who killed Miller.

546
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,229
I told you a thousand times

547
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,430
she don't
know any guy
named Miller.

548
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,831
Don't go to pieces, Marty.

549
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,967
What makes you think
she knows anything
about it?

550
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,635
Son, I've got a feeling.

551
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,537
And you know when--

552
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,438
[everybody]
You've got a feeling,

553
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,439
you've got a feeling.

554
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,773
You've got a feeling?

555
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,175
Who is this dame?

556
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,042
Her name is Leda Hamilton.

557
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,444
She sings here.
Songs.

558
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,045
Foreign-type
songs.

559
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,047
Now will you take
your old lady home?

560
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,449
My customers
start thinking
about

561
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,918
home and mother,
I'm a dead duck.
And you know it.

562
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,052
Now get her out of here!

563
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,654
That big blow-hard.

564
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:43,590
I'd like to--

565
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:46,057
all right, mom,
where is this dame?

566
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,660
Here.

567
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:56,668
Woman:
* Cheri, Cheri, my own *

568
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,204
* Cheri... *

569
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,471
that's her.

570
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,473
Are you sure it's the same girl?

571
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,941
Why, of course.
Take a good look at her.

572
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:09,481
* oh, I could play you
a thousand ways *

573
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:15,721
* I'll say it all
in that old sweet way... *

574
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,088
she's not bad.

575
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,089
What's that?

576
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,491
I said it's a sad song.

577
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,092
Maitre d':
Table, sir?

578
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,194
No, not just yet.

579
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,429
OK, mom, I'll have
a talk with her.

580
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,097
You do that, son.
Ask her what she knows.

581
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,766
Oh, sure. I'll find
out everything.

582
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,036
Including address,
telephone number,
and open dates.

583
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,371
Sunshine, put
my mother in a cab,

584
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,372
and have Starchy take her home.

585
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,373
It'll be a pleasure.

586
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,707
Good night, mom.

587
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,709
I'll give you
a full report
in the morning.

588
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,578
You do that, son.

589
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,512
Good night, and go to bed early.

590
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,249
Oh, yes, I'll go to bed early.

591
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,986
* I love you *

592
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:52,958

593
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,726
* that's what I... *

594
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,127
hey, Joe.

595
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,529
What's he doing here?

596
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,398
Him and his old lady's
been driving me nuts.

597
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,132
If he wants a table,
tell him we're all
filled up.

598
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,134
If he starts cracking,
heave him out.

599
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,136
I'll do it in reverse.

600
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,072
I'll make him feel
like a fish peddler.

601
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,141
We're all sold out,
Mr. Donahue.

602
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,143
Hello, Joe.
What do ya' know?

603
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,545
Don't say that to me.

604
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,547
Look, Donahue,
our prices are
too high for you.

605
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,549
You'd look much better
carrying your own tray.

606
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,551
Besides, we only cater
to the smart set.

607
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,553
One of your off nights, eh?

608
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,155
I'm only going to be
here a few minutes.

609
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,157
What time is it?

610
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,593
You done that on purpose.

611
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,561
Now, don't get
me mad, Donahue,
I got a bad temper.

612
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,562
You also got a bad memory.

613
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,697
3 months in a plaster cast

614
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,565
the last time you
tangled with me.

615
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,666
Thanks for reminding me.

616
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,734
That's still one
I got to pay off.

617
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,770
Back to your
smart set, Reginald.

618
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,373
Fish peddler.

620
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:50,782

621

622
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,571
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

623
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:17,042
And now I would like to do
a number that I first sang
in Paris at the belle tableau.

* all through the dream,
violins sing to me *

630
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:51,643
* and all through the song,
I feel you cling to me *

636
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,888
Yes?

637
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:37,889
Remember me?

639
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,560
Well, I...

640
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,763
I know, you meet so many people.

641
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,164
That's it.

642

Miller's bakery this afternoon.

643
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,803
I'd like to have
a little conference
with you.

644
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:52,672
I, uh...

645
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,606
Suppose we step over to the bar.

646
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,806
We'll have a drink.

647
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,509
All right.

648
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,280
What'll you have?

649
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,682
Sherry, please.

650
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,784
Sherry for the lady
and a double Martini
for me.

651
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:06,918
Yes, sir.

652
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,720
Now, miss Hamilton,
I don't mind telling
you,

653
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,322
you can certainly
sling those
obbligtatos around.

654
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,323
Thanks.

655
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,324
Woman: Hello, Gloves.

656
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,326
Hi, uh...
Nice kid.

657
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,128
I met her at the junior prom.

658
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,264
Now, what was it
you wanted to talk
to me about?

659
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,734
Well, I don't know
exactly how to begin
this beguine.

660
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,603
My old lady had
a feeling that
you might be able

661
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:25,937
to tell me something
about Miller's death.

662
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,739
Said she
and the neighbors
used to see you

663
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,941
down at the place quite often.

664
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,342
Well, of course.

665
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,744
I--I was a customer.

666
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,346
I seem to remember
you were saying
this afternoon

667
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,748
that it was something personal.

668
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,749
Did I?

669
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,151
Yeah.

670
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,222
I can't remember anything
I said. I was so upset.

671
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,457
Well, that makes sense.

672
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,358
I'm sorry I bothered
you, miss Hamilton.

673
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,760
Not at all.

674
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,928
See, my old lady
was pretty upset.

675
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,963
The Millers were
good friends of ours.

676
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,164
Yes, I know.

677
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,466
Huh?

678
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,367
If there's anything
I could do for his family,

679
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,636
I...

680
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,204
I never met Mrs. Miller.

681
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,640
But he certainly was
one of the nicest men
I've ever known.

682
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,174
Yes, he was OK.

683
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,512
My only complaint
is that he didn't
tell me about you.

684
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,379
Well, that's too bad.

685
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,948
He told me all
about you, though.

686
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:10,949
No fooling?

687
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,217
No fooling.

688
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,185
He knew you ever
since you went to
public school 139.

689
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,388
Your real name
is Alfred, but you
keep it a secret.

690
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,390
Yeah, and don't you
give it away.

691
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,592
What else?

692
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,393
You gave him a dozen
ties for Christmas.

693
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,195
You eat
his cheesecake
3 times a day

694
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,364
and make
every restaurant
on Broadway buy it,

695

or else.

00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,200
Oh, now,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

697
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,402
Miller never gave you
that "or else" business.

698
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,804
No. Mr. Callahan.

699
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,406
And he intimated
that you were
a no-good,

700
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,808
double-crossing,
chiseling--

701
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,810
which one do you
want to believe?

702
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,411
I'll tell you some other time.

703
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,147
OK.

Mr. Donahue.

706

possibly leave

Oh, hello, Pepi.

708
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,126
Pepi, this is
Mr. Donahue.

709
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,896
Mr. Donahue,
this is Pepi,
my accompanist.

710

Hiya.

711
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,432
Mr. Donahue is
opening a new club
in a few weeks.

712
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,601
Oh, is he?

713
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,035
Yes, and he's asked me
to work for him.

714
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:04,837
Oh, he did?

715
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,438
Yeah, it's
a brand-new idea.

716
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,840
I was thinking
miss Hamilton here

717
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,441
is quite an attraction.

718
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,577
Isn't she?

719
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,178
But we are perfectly happy here,

720
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,179
are we not?

721
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,246
Of course.

722
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,849
And, now, Mr. Donahue,
if you will excuse us.

723
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,350
I'd like to finish
my drink, please.

724
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,019
But we have to rehearse.

725
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,855
Didn't you hear her?
The lady said she'd like
to finish her drink.

726
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,924
And I said we have no time.

727
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,060
I wouldn't advise
you to do that.

728
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:29,996
Do what?

729
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,429
Listen, weasel,
back to your piano.

730
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,764
Please,
Mr. Donahue.

731
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,032
I don't like
the way he's
pushing you around.

732
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,634
It isn't important.
Please don't interfere.

733
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:36,868
Come on.
Let her alone.

734
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:37,869
Take your hands off me.

735
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,070
Just a minute,
Mr. Donahue.

736
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,338
We don't want
any disturbance
here.

737
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,472
I warned you when you came in.

738
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,874
Oh, he's just trying
to persuade her

739
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,475
to quit
Mr. Callahan.

740
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,877
Oh, chiseling again, huh?

741
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,878
I'm afraid we'll have to ask you

742
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,879
to leave,
Mr. Donahue.

743
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Lightly and politely.

744
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,749
Why don't you shut up?

745
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,618
I'm getting hoarse
listening to you.

746
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,085
Good night,
Mr. Donahue.

747
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,486
Miss Hamilton--

748
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,888
now would you leave?

749
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,890
Or do you want a sample

751
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,695
OK, Reginald.

Spread a carpet for him
on his way out.

753
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,202

Good night.

758
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,133
And you'd better not come back.

759
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,736
Thanks for the tip.

760
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,872
Can we go now, coach?

761
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:48,173

me a job as

00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,143
I might as well be one, too.

765

You know, I'm worried
about that canary.

766
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,580
She's in some kind of a jam.

767
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:59,150
May I remind you we
have a rendezvous with
a couple of cowboys?

768

for the duration.

771
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,557
I don't get it.
I marry Annabelle,

772

and I spend my
honeymoon with you.

773

Joe, what's the matter?

779
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:46,597
The dame.
They got the dame.

00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,199
What are you talking about?

to tell me, Joe?

Hey, which way did that cab go?

out of the alley.

What?

Drive me down
to the diamond

Here we go again, boys.

795
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,606
Got any idea who bumped Joe off?

796
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,008
No. He died before
he could tell me.

797
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,609
All he did was hold up
his hand like this.

798
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,710
What for?

799
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,645
Maybe he wanted
to leave the room.

800

sooner or later.

one of our cabs?

Positive. It almost
flattened me.

as Frankie calls in.

would know me better
than that.

from the duchess bar
about 8:30 tonight?

in luck, Gloves.

to a warehouse at

I suddenly
remember something
from my youth.

884
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,195
Good evening, officer.

885
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,930
How are you?
This your cab?
Yes, sir.

886
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,198
Better get it out of here

887
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,332
before somebody
takes it away
from you.

888
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,800
I can't.
I'm waiting
for a fare.

889
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,202
Stick around.
You'll get one.

Oh...

896
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,216
Personally, I'd feel
more comfortable
if I had a rod.

897
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,218
Here lies sunshine
under the sod.

898
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:02,620
That's not odd, he had no rod.

899
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:06,025
You know,
there are times when
I wonder about you.

00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:26,644
What would a sweetheart
like that Hamilton dame
be doing in a dump like this?

901
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:30,049
Maybe she still believes
in Santie Claus.

I must have slipped.

00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,845
You must have slipped.

906
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:04,216
All right, dig yourself
out of there and let's go.

This is not
my idea how to spend
a pleasant evening.

908
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:15,893
Right now I could
be dealing myself
a straight flush.

If I could only figure out what

910

Joe meant when he
held up his hand.

I know he must've
been trying to tell
me something

912
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,901
or show me something.

I wonder what's up there.

with a guy inside.

Where'd you get that?

Coach, he ain't with you!

Somebody yanked
him on an elevator

and took him up to
the third floor,

932

said you got to

It's all clear to me, ain't it?

Wait a minute, I got an idea.

This building must

the famous holbrook collection.

of this magnificent piece.

in particular you're
interested in?

and raise her 5.

the cashier come out here
for your convenience.

find it more profitable
to remain.

wonderful items

I will attend
to this gentleman
personally.

Won't you sit down?

1042
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,049
Oh, thanks.

1043

Nice show you put on out there.

1044

Thank you.

1045

How would you like to pay?

1046
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,589
Got a blank check?

1047
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,457
Certainly.

1048
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,459
Here we are.

1049
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,061
Got a pen?

1050
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,664
Of course.

1051
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:50,601
Aw, it broke.

1052
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,602
Oh.

1053
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,603
Another antique, eh?

1054
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,872
Try this one, sir.

1055
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,742
Fascinating idea, a blank check,

1056
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,476
if you ever stop
to think about it.

1057
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,878
Yes, very fascinating.

1058
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,280
This is a nice
layout you got here.

1059
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,883
Full of stuff
to tempt the eyes,
as they say.

1060
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,485
Perhaps we could tempt
you with something
to go with a desk?

1061
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:09,720
Oh, no. No, thanks.

1062
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,756
Oh, you wouldn't happen to have

1063
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,590
anything
in the toy line,
would you?

1064
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,794
Toys?

1065
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,295
No antique toys.

1066
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,664
No, modern.

1067
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:23,100
When my nephew gets
through with them,
they'll be antique.

1068
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:23,902
Ha ha ha!

1069
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:26,103
That's very charming.

1070
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,537
There you are.

1071
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,375
[Elevator starts]

1072
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:34,812
What's that?

1073
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,080
The ventilating system.

1074
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:37,514
Yeah? Well, somebody
took a shot at me

1075
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:38,783
in that ventilating
system of yours

1076
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:39,850
and hijacked a pal of mine.

1077
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:42,119
Keep your hands in front of you.

1078
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,921
I beg your pardon?

1079
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:44,021
Now, listen, Buddy,

1080
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,055
I don't know what
your racket is.

1081
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,523
And I'm trying not to move in.

1082
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:47,524
But I gotta know one thing.

1083
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:48,525
Where's miss Hamilton?

1084
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,526
Miss Hamilton?

1085
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,228
Yeah.

1086
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,931
I'm afraid you have us
confused with the bureau
of missing persons.

1087
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,100
Madame, will you show
this gentleman the door?

1088
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,002
Certainly.

1089
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:58,268
I'd advise you
to butt out, madame.

1090
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,670
You know, you're not
a bad-looking character.

1091
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,906
I'd hate to see that
fine nose of yours

1092
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:03,207
smeared all over your pan.

1093
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,011
I gotta know,
where's miss Hamilton?

1094
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,147
Oh, hello, baby.

1095
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,282
I don't know what
these monkeys are
trying to do to you,

1096
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,785
but you got nothing
to worry about now.
I'm here.

1097
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,921
I wouldn't advise
you to do that.

1098
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:20,826
The little lady
and I are going out.

1099
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,098
Don't bother me now.
I'm busy.

1100
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,666
You say Donahue
followed you here
from the club?

1101
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,667
That's right.

1102
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,269
Who was with him?

1103
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,104
Two of his friends.

1104
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:34,671
One we got in a warehouse.

1105
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,073
The other is downstairs
in the auction room.

1106
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,507
Did they find out anything?

1107
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,909
I don't think so.

1108
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,477
This man, Leda,
is he a friend
of yours?

1109
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:42,679
No. I met
him tonight for
the first time.

1110
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,814
What were they doing
at the club?

1111
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,282
Oh, talking.

1112
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,683
But very intimately.

1113
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,985
What about?

1114
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,686
He offered me a job.

1115
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,955
He's opening a new club.

1116
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:52,089
What does he do, Pepi?

1117
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,691
Oh, he's a Broadway big shot.

1118
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,960
Very belligerent personality.

1119
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:57,427
[Intercom buzzes]

1120
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,528
Yes?

1121
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,497
Man on intercom:
Fleischer's here.

1122
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:00,697
Send him in.

1123
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,032
Schroeder
and Holzmeir
will be late.

1124
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:02,768
The plane has
been forced down
at Harrisburg.

1125
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,268
Bad weather.

1126
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,103
Tell them they must
get here as quickly
as possible.

1127
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,504
They must take a chance.

1128
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,706
Come in, Fleischer.

1129
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,280
Did you bring the drawings?

1130
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:17,314
I couldn't do it.

1131
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,482
It wasn't possible.

1132
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:19,850
You had your instructions.

1133
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,585
If those drawings disappear,

1134
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,120
I'll be held responsible.

1135
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,721
As foreman of the plant,

1136
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,490
the police
would come
to see me first.

1137
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,892
I can't do it.

1138
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,394
I must keep my job.

1139
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:34,131
And the next time,
I break your neck.

1140
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,900
Ebbing: Now get me
those drawings.

1141
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,103
We must have them tonight.

1142
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,743
I'm sure he'll bring them now.

1143
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,379
Pepi, you'd better
look after Donahue.

1144
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,948
Arrange to have a truck

1145
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,850
take him and his friend
to New Jersey.

1146
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:54,985
Madame, get rid of
the other one downstairs.

1147
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:55,986
What about this girl?

1148
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,988
We will discuss it later.

1149
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,056
Later? Why not now?

1150
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:01,758
I said we will discuss it later.

1151
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,361
But Pepi hasn't told you
all about her.

1152
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:05,562
This afternoon, she--

1153
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,564
madame, I know my duty.

1154
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,099
I hope you know yours.

1155
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,700
What about the meeting?

1156
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,701
Are you still holding it here?

1157
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,903
Why not?

1158
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:14,471
Isn't it dangerous
after what's happened?

1159
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:17,007
It will take more
than Mr. Donahue
to disrupt my schedule.

1160
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:19,377
I told you
what to do.
Do it.

1161
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,780
Get Steinem on the phone.

1162
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,182
Wait in my study, Leda.

1163
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,051
The meeting
will be held at 3:00.

1164
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,854
Tell everybody to use
the warehouse entrance.

1165
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,255
Auctioneer:
I am offered 750.

1166
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:36,193
750 once, 750 twice,
sold to Mr. marlin for 750.

1167
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,795
We'll charge that
to your account, sir.

1168
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,897
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

1169
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,131
concludes our session
for tonight.

1170
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,666
Next week we are
offering the contents

1171
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:43,800
of a Southampton estate.

1172
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,802
I hope to see you all then.

1173
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,805
Good night,
and thank you for coming.

1174
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,408
Good night.

1175
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,212
Are you waiting for someone?

1176
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,646
Yes, ma'am,
I'm waiting
for my friend.

1177
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,815
He's kind of a tall,
dark, handsome-like
gentleman.

1178
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,317
I don't seem to remember him.

1179
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,819
Yes, you do. He's
the one that bought
the fancy desk.

1180
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,221
Paid quite
a lot of scratch
for it, too.

1181
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,957
Oh, yes.
The Louis xv with
the gilt ormolu.

1182
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,225
No, ma'am.
Just a desk.

1183
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,759
But that was some time ago.

1184
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,361
He paid for it...

1185
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,263
And left.

1186
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:13,830
No. He wouldn't
leave without me.

1187
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,832
I'm just like his right hand.

1188
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,634
We was kids together
down on the east side.

1189
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,104
I'm sorry I haven't
time to listen to
your biography.

1190
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,405
We're closing now.

1191
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:22,406
I must ask you to go.

1192
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,473
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1193
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,708
I ain't moving
a budge without
my friend.

1194
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:25,842
Then I shall insist.

1195
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,843
Look it, lady,

1196
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:27,978
when we started out tonight

1197
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,079
there was 3 of us.

1198
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,247
20 minutes later
there was only 2.

1199
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,848
Now there's only one.

1200
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,850
One of us ain't enough
to leave here alone.

1201
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,054
I'll go and see it myself.

1202
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,524
Hello.

1203
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,259
Will you show this gentleman
to the door, Anton?

1204
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,862
Careful, Buddy,
I got a very
nasty temper.

1205
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,464
You don't intimidate me.

1206
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,865
I'm warning you.

1207
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,267
I'll tell the police.

1208
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,469
I'll tell them he's here.

1209
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,670
Why don't you?

1210
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,406
I understand they, too,
are looking for Mr. Donahue.

1211
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,874
Oh.

1212
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,476
Good night.

1213
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:00,544
Good night, ma'am.

1214
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,546
I'm going.

1215
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,582
I said good night, didn't I?

1216
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,362
What are you doing here?

1217
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,896
Ebbing asked me to wait for him.

1218
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,897
Where is he?

1219
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,898
In the office.

1220
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,233
You can see him there.

1221
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,634
He asked me to wait
for him here.

1222
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:28,505
Madame, there is
no reason for you
to dislike me.

1223
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:32,009
I not only
dislike you,
I distrust you.

1224
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,044
But I'm sure you
know that if ever

1225
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,679
you attempted to betray us,

1226
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,914
your father
will be the first
to hear of it

1227
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,316
and the first to pay for it.

1228
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:40,717
And if you have any idea

1229
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:42,386
that your friend
Mr. Donahue

00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,269
C'mon, let's get out of here.

1405
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,473
I think I'll take this along.
It might come in handy.

1406
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:52,042
I'm gonna take
a look around.
Come on.

1407
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:03,252
Take a peek down there.

1408
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,658
If you hear a blowout,
you'll know I bumped into Gary.

1409
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,668
[Voices]

1410
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,340
...discontent and confusion.

1411
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:26,476
Do you ever look at the faces

1412
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:28,377
of these Americans
as they read the headlines?

1413
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:32,882
Already we have split them
into angry little groups
flying at each other,

1414
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,884
unconscious they
are doing our work.

1415
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:39,889
You will see...In a year,
perhaps less than a year,

1416
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,627
they will all be taking
their orders from us.

1417
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:45,995
First, brother rat,
you take a few orders from me.

1418
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:47,296
Get 'em up.

1419
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,099
We're gonna let the cops in
on some of your bright ideas.

1420
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,501
Thank you.

1421
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:54,070
But for the present
I would rather keep
my ideas to myself.

1422
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:56,305
Listen, buster,
you ain't got no
secrets from me.

1423
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,775
I just took
a quick tour through
your tunnel of love.

1424
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:00,844
Looks like the
number one office of
Hitler and company.

1425
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,779
You're comin' along,
too, sister.

1426
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,380
You realize
you will never
get out of here.

1427
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:05,615
Every entrance is guarded.

1428
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:06,716
Aw, don't try that line
on me, Jack.

1429
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,652
This is Broadway, not Berlin.

1430
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:10,119
It's a great pity,
Mr. Donahue,

1431
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,188
that you and I should
oppose each other.

1432
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:13,657
We have so much in common.

1433
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:14,858
Yeah? How's that?

1434
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:16,459
You are a man of action.

1435
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,161
You take what you want,
and so do we.

1436
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,196
You have no respect
for democracy.

1437
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,598
Neither do we.

1438
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,299
It's clear we should be allies.

1439
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,734
It's clear you are screwy.

1440
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,469
I been a registered democrat

1441
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,871
ever since I could vote.

1442
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:29,272
I may not be
model citizen
number one,

1443
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:31,407
but I pay my taxes,
wait for traffic lights,

1444
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:34,110
and buy
24 tickets regular
to the policeman's ball.

1445
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,879
Brother, don't get me
mixed up in no league

1446
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,214

little bakers and--

[gunshot]

1448
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,753
Excellent.

1449
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:45,755
Did you learn that
in one of your gang wars?

1450
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:47,156
No, that's a little
trick I picked up

1451
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,358
from Benny's
shooting gallery
in coney island.

1452
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,560
And if you don't quit stalling,

1453
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:51,861
I'll show you some other tricks

1454
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,429
I learned in Brooklyn.

1455
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:55,765
Well, Leda,
it's useless to argue
with such determination.

where you going, buster?

1457
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,768
For my hat, if you don't object.

1458
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,169
You make another
false start like that,

1459
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,771
you won't have a head
to put it on.

1460
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:03,708
Get those hands up.

1461
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,244
A smart character, ain't you?

1462
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:16,119
All right, go ahead.
Get your hat.

1463
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,722

There'll be a dozen men
up here in a moment.

Please let me explain!

out of this one, sister.

Now you've got to help me.

know what you're up to,

to the hot seat.

Joe Denning, and you know
who killed Miller,

going on around here.

01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:40,836
What's he got to do with it?

1575
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:43,306
They're holding him
in a concentration camp
in Germany.

1576
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,709
Unless I keep on
working with Ebbing,
they'll kill him.

1577
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,378
Wait a minute...

1578
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:58,187
Where's this place,
d-a-c-h-a-u?

1579
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,789
Dachau--that's where
they're holding him.

1580
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,658
What do you know about it?

01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,574
Stay over there.

1584
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:28,377
Gloves. You're looking
for me, I suppose.

1585
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,213
Yeah.

1586
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,416
I thought you'd run out on me.

1587
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:36,220
There's no need for that now.

1588
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,755
Tough luck, kid.

1589
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,758
I'll do whatever you say.

1590
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,228
OK.

1591
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:58,707

1593
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:01,310
Hello,
Westmore hotel--

1594
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:02,778
oh, good evening.

1595
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,180
Give me a room, curly.

1596
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:05,448
With or without?

1597
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:07,650
It don't make any difference.

1598
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,051
Any kind.

1599
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,319
Boy.

1600
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,920
For me and the lady.

1601
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,190
And who might that be?
My mother.

1602
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:15,858
Have you got
any baggage?
No.

1603
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,060
Well, I'm sorry, but
I can't give you a room
without baggage. I--

1604
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,862
give me that key.
Call up the cops

1605
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,064
and tell them you got
Gloves Donahue
up in room 214.

1606
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,466
Who?
Gloves Donahue!

1607
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:25,201
I'm a murderer, a killer.

1608
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,002
There's my picture--
one of my best.

1609
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:29,472
Come on, kid.
There's a 10 grand
reward out for me.

1610
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:30,873
You'll never have
another chance like this

in the Irish sweepstakes.

Operator, give me
the police, quick!

1614

This ain't
exactly in my line,
playing nursemaid.

1615
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,237
Feeling better?

1616
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:02,638
Thanks.

1617
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,242
Aw, now, come on.
Cut that out, now.

1618
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:08,844
Here. Here,

1619
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,513
Sorry about tonight, kid.

1620
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,515
Sorry you had to go
through all this.

1621
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,383
It wasn't your fault, Gloves.

1622
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:16,118
Well, I wish you
could have found out

1623
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:18,254
about your old man
in some easier way.

1624
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:20,256
Quite a shock, wasn't it?

1625
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:23,125
It's all right.
Just as well.

1626
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:25,528
It's better for him this way.

1627
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,563
Sure it is.
It's better
for you, too.

1628
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,533
At least they can't
kick you around
any longer.

1629
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:33,101
How'd you ever get
tied up with them
in the first place?

1630
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,137
I came here 2 years ago.

1631
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:36,872
Ebbing found out
I was in New York

1632
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:38,407
and gave me the choice--

1633
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:41,410
my services or my father's life.

1634
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,978
Nice characters.

1635
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,381
What were you supposed to do?

1636
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:48,150
Meet important people,
try and get information.

1637
01:09:48,151 --> 01:09:49,752
That's why I was at the club.

1638
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:51,153
I knew you was OK

1639
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,555
the first time
I talked to you tonight.

1640
01:09:52,556 --> 01:09:55,558
Like my old lady says,
"I had a feeling."

1641
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:57,159
Then, as the evening wore on,

1642
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,761
I got a little mixed up.

1643
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:01,163
When I caught that
conversation between
you and the head man,

1644
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:03,966
well, I...I guess
I blew my topper.

1645
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:07,169
Now, you were saying
that Miller and Joe
were bumped off

1646
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,471
by the same guy.

1647
01:10:08,472 --> 01:10:10,038
Who was it?
Pepi.

1648
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,307
Pepi? That squirt?

1649
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:12,708
What'd he have against Miller?

1650
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,310
They were
working together,
weren't they?

1651
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:16,712
No. Miller was working
under pressure, too.

1652
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,515
They must have asked him
to do something,
and he refused.

1653
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:22,184
Oh, I see. Well,
we'll get that Pepi.

1654
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:23,586
We got a special little gadget

1655
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:26,054
up in sing sing that'll
just melt him away.

1656
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,756
It isn't only Pepi, Gloves.

1657
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,592
There are hundreds
of them in New York,

1658
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,193
in every city of the country.

1659
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:32,595
They get around, don't they.

1660
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,196
I was glancing
through this book.

1661
01:10:34,197 --> 01:10:35,598
What's in there is nothing

1662
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,433
compared to what they're
going to do tonight.

1663
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:39,468
They're planning something
much more serious

1664
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,570
than anything they've
ever done before.

1665
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,671
Yeah?

1666
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:44,873
That's what Miller
wanted to talk to me about,

1667
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,075
and that's what I was trying
to find out from Ebbing

1668
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,611
when you came into the room.

1669
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:51,614
Holy smoke.
Haven't you got any idea
what it's all about?

1670
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:54,216
No, but I do know that
there's a meeting

1671
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:56,018
at 3:00
at the antique shop,

1672
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:59,221
and they're expecting
2 munition experts
from Detroit.

1673
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:01,824
How about that?

1674
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:03,225
Munition experts, huh?

1675
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:05,628
You say their meeting's
at 3:00?

1676
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:07,496
Yes.
Well, we'll
bust that up.

All right, you tell the cops
everything you told me.

1680
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:14,637
That'll even up the score
for both of us.

1681
01:11:14,638 --> 01:11:16,372
Come in, boys.
Am I glad to see you.

1682
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:17,906
All right, kitty,
get your coat on.

with an escort.

Ebbing:
Good evening.

1685
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:27,617
To quote you, Mr. Donahue,
"get them up."

1686
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,490
You're like a bad penny.

1687
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:35,991
Are you all right, Leda?

1688
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,259
Yes.

1689
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,995
Good. He won't annoy you
any longer.

1690
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,597

Yes.

1692
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,506
Yes...I know.

1693
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:53,776
I'm sorry, but your father was
an enemy of the state.

1694
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:55,544
That's no excuse for murder.

1695
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:58,080
I'm afraid you will be
of no further use to us.

1696

Ok, buster. It looks
like it's your pot.

Mm-hmm.

01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,431

Now I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

something for you.

to keep him.

get away with that!

They're fifth columnists!

Yeah, and I'm Hitler.

1713

you dope, don't let them
get away with it!

and that fire in
the shipyard a month ago?

1717
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,363
This outfit's back of all that,

1718
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,332
and that antique
joint's the front
for the whole works.

1719
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,734
You take my breath away.

1720
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,336
Now, why don't
you start your story

1721
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:55,871
with "once upon a time"...

1722
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,473
Now, stop kidding around,
will you, Forbes?

1723
01:12:57,474 --> 01:12:58,874
I'm giving it to you straight.

1724
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,476
It's all down in that book
I was telling you about.

1725
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,545
Oh, yes, the book.
We mustn't forget the book.

1726
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,480
He's right,
lieutenant. You've
got to believe us.

1727
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,749
All I want to know is
who killed Joe Denning?

1728
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,484
A goggle-eyed
little rat named Pepi,

1729
01:13:08,485 --> 01:13:10,052
and he's the guy
that got Miller, too.

1730
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:12,788
You're making a very naughty boy
out of this Pepi.

1731
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,222
What I don't understand is,

1732
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,959
what is the connection
between Joe Denning and Miller?

1733
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,326
I told you 50 times.

1734
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,896
I don't grasp it.
Maybe I'm not big
enough mentally.

1735
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,898
Listen, if you don't quit
munching that sandwich

1736
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,833
and throw that
feeble brain of yours
into high gear,

1737
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:26,902

going to hijack
the statue of Liberty.

I'll show you their hangout.

Ok, I'm no prude.

I'd like to see
this den of bogeymen.

1741
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:36,779

take that sandwich.

01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,615
And that goes for you, too.

1743
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:48,791
What are you going
in this way for?

1744
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:50,225
They got a trick entrance
around in the back

1745
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:51,627
through the warehouse.

1746
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:53,261
I like to be conventional.
Let's go in the front way.

1747
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,563
You might just as well
have phoned and told him
you were coming.

1748
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:56,198
Listen, Gloves,
I'm a simple man.

1749
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:59,067
I can only digest
one hunk of bunk
at a time.

1750
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:01,403
Yeah, well, you'll
change your mind
when you get inside.

1751
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:04,006
It's possible
I could be convinced.

1752
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:06,174
Well, here we go.

1753
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,543
Well?

1754
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,012
Open up.

1755
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:11,547
What do you want?

1756
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:12,948
What do I want?

1757
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,583
What do I look like?
Open up.

1758
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,151
Yes, sir.

1759
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:18,887
Don't worry, boys.
They told me there'd
be nights like this.

1760
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,156
All right.

1761
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,160
The main office is
right down this hall.

1762
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,562
This'll open up your eyes.

1763
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:27,896
You're scaring me.

1764
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:30,065
Sounds like the next
installment of superman.

1765
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:31,568
My kids will enjoy this.

1766
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:38,440
How about this?

1767
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:40,544
Very convincing.

1768
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:46,849
Yeah, but...
I don't get it.

1769
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,584
There was a bunch
of desks in here,

1770
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:50,452
and a lot of maps
on the wall, and--

1771
01:14:50,453 --> 01:14:51,954
and a shortwave
radio over there,

1772
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:53,421
and a picture of
what's-his-name,
and--

1773
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,823
maybe they're still here.

1774
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,592
Maybe we just can't see them.

1775
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,860
Aw, why don't you
quit being funny.

1776
01:14:57,861 --> 01:14:59,361
I saw them with my own eyes.

1777
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:01,463
Great evidence.
An invisible office.

1778
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:02,865
Hey, you...

1779
01:15:02,866 --> 01:15:05,467
What became
of all the stuff
that was in here?

1780
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:07,135
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1781
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:09,071
This has been a storeroom
as long as I've been here.

1782
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:11,139
What are you trying to
tell me? I was in here
only an hour ago and I--

1783
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,141
don't get excited, Gloves.
Take it easy.

1784
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:14,409
Yeah, but this guy's
one of them, too.

1785
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,644
How long you been working here?

1786
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,279
Oh, 5 or 6 years.

1787
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,648
He's lying.
I've never seen
him here before.

1788
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:22,117
Anything been moved
out of this room tonight?

1789
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,251
Not that I know of.

1790
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,588
The gentleman must have
another place in mind.

1791
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:27,055
No, I haven't got any
other place in mind--

1792
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,792
now, Gloves, the good little
fairy won't like it.

1793
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:31,326
Gloves,
the elevator--

1794
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:33,796
they must have
moved all the stuff
into the warehouse.

1795
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:35,463
The elevator, that's it.
I forgot all about that.

1796
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,066
Come on, boys.

1797
01:15:39,803 --> 01:15:41,670
Right over here
behind this wall.

1798
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:43,238
How do you get in there, baby?

1799
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,573
There's a switch over here.

1800
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:46,809
Now, you fellas
better stand back.
It opens out that way.

1801
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,210
Gloves,
it's gone.
What?

1802
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,813
There was a button
releasing a spring.

1803
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:52,080
I think I have a clue, folks.

1804
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:53,548
Aladdin dropped in
with his lamp,

1805
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,817
gave it a couple of rubs,

1806
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:56,084
and the whole thing disappeared.

1807
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:57,720
Now, you got to listen
to me, Forbes--

1808
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,021
I've been listening
to you. Now you
listen to me.

1809
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:00,555
I'll tell you what we'll do.

1810
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,290
We'll all get
on our magic carpet

1811
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,692
and get back to the station.

1812
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,794
We'll let the D.A.
Unravel this
in the morning.

1813
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:06,962
But tomorrow morning
will be too late.

1814
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:08,130
We've got to find them tonight.

1815
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,632
He's telling you
the truth, lieutenant.

1816
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:10,933
We've got to stop them tonight.

1817
01:16:10,934 --> 01:16:12,434
I'm sorry, miss Hamilton.

1818
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:14,837
You're acting
your part fine, but
I'm a bad audience.

1819
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:16,304
Now, I'm booking you
for murder, Gloves,

1820
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,106
and holding
your girlfriend for
further questioning.

1821
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,708
I'm telling you
that behind that wall

1822
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:21,309
there's an elevator
that leads to a warehouse

1823
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,577
in the next block.

1824
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,979
I've had
enough of that--

1825
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,448
elevators, radios,
secret panels!

1826
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:28,785
I'm tired chasing butterflies!

1827
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,988
Ok, baby, I guess it's no dice.

1828
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:35,590
The lieutenant
is losing his temper.

1829
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,592
I surrender, dear.

1830
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,262
Come on.

1831
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,066
Wait.

1832
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:45,467
What is it now?

1833
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,202
Leda...

1834
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,938
That curtain.

1835
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:55,477
Oh, the curtain!
Of course!

1836
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:57,012
You gonna start that again?

1837
01:16:57,013 --> 01:17:01,350
No...I think that's
what I been looking for.

1838
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:15,097
What do you see?

1839
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,631
Nothing.

1840
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,100
See you later, baby!

1841
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:19,768
Forbes: Come back
here, Gloves!

1842
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:21,169
Don't let him
get away, boys!
Go get him!

1843
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,238
You can't get away
with this, Gloves!

1844
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,841
[Gunshots]

1845
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:33,249
[Pounding on door]

1846
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,863
Come back, Gloves,
or I'll shoot.

1847
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:51,466
Sunshine:
Hello, hello? Yeah.

1848
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:52,600
Let me talk to Benny.

1849
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,036
Here you are, sunshine.

1850
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:55,670
Hello, Benny?
You seen anything
of Gloves tonight?

1851
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,072
Yeah, we know the cops
are looking for him.

1852
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:58,941
Keeps your lamps open,
and if you see him,

1853
01:17:58,942 --> 01:18:00,809
we're waiting at Spats' place.

1854
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,210
Can I use the phone, please?

1855
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:03,812
Go away.
What about yip's place?

1856
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:06,214
I called him.
No soap. I'll try
the golden rule.

1857
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:07,682
Can't I please phone Annabelle?

1858
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,951
Hey, what's eating you?

1859
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:10,218
I'm worried about my honeymoon.

1860
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,987
I just got
married tonight.
So what?

1861
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:13,621
Gloves might be lying
in an alley with a knife
in his back.

1862
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,824
You ought to be
worrying about him,
not your honeymoon.

1863
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,292
Can't I worry about them both?

1864
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,360
Ah, the line's busy.

1865
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:19,962
Can I use the phone,
please, can I, huh?

1866
01:18:19,963 --> 01:18:21,563
All right, call her,
but make it a quickie.

1867
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:22,998
Well, what do we do now?

1868
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,967
The best thing
for Gloves to do
is to get on a plane

1869
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:26,568
and go as far as it'll take him.

1870
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,136
What kind of a mouthpiece
are you?

1871
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:30,238
You're making
a convict out of him
before they convict him!

1872
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,140
Hey, don't you
start complaining.

1873
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:34,309
You're the guy that
got him mixed up in this
thing from the first.

1874
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,543
Who me?
Yeah, you!

1875
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,246
I told you, we were
at the ball game
this afternoon

1876
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,983
when his old lady called up
and told us about that
Miller's cheesecake--

1877
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:42,717
if I hear that story again,
I'll go nuts.

1878
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,119
Wait a minute.
Hey, fellas, please.

1879
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,720
I'm trying
to converse
with Annabelle.

1880
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,022
Converse, converse!

1881
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:48,656
Don't get
sore, Annabelle.
I can't help it.

1882
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,058
I'm lonesome, too.

1883
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:53,061
I'm doing the very best I can.

1884
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,063
I'm only human, after all.

1885
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,465
I'm at Spats' place,
honest I am!

1886
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:58,801
I'm waiting here for Gloves!

1887
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:00,135
Tell her, will you, fellas?

1888
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,703
Forget her!
I'll get you another dame.

1889
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,138
Annabelle, I don't
want another dame.

1890
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:05,207
No, I don't love Gloves
more than I love you.

1891
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,741
Please tell her,
will you, fellas--

1892
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,143
hang up, stupid!

1893
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:09,611
No, Annabelle--
Anna--

1894
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:11,013
all right, she hung up.

1895
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:12,480
Now you see what you've done?

1896
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:13,748
She's going to divorce me

1897
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,150
and name Gloves as corespondent.

1898
01:19:15,151 --> 01:19:17,152
Don't worry, junior.
You need the experience.

1899
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:18,753
But I haven't had
any experience!

1900
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:19,955
Sunshine:
Hey, Spats!

1901
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,389
What's the matter?

1902
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,126
Quick!
Give a look!

1903
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:28,363
Sunshine: Callahan
and his boys are downstairs.

1904
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:29,597
Uh-oh.

1905
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:30,933
We're wasting our time, boys.

1906
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,634
Gloves will never pass
through that picket line.

1907
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:34,136
He'll show.
I'll sign an affidavit.

1908
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:35,770
Hey, fellas, what
about these cowboys?

1909
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,472
I can't hold on
to them much longer.

1910
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:38,941
If I have to listen
to that song once more,
I'll shoot them both.

1911
01:19:38,942 --> 01:19:40,175
And I'll bury them.

1912
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:41,609
Do me a favor.
Let them go.

1913
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,045
What about the poker game?

1914
01:19:43,046 --> 01:19:44,612
Forget it.
What?
Forget 20 grand?

1915
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,214
Gloves is in a jam,
and that dough will buy
a lot of writs

1916
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:48,050
of surceasement
and habeas corpuses,
ipso facto.

1917
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,517
Hey, that's good.

1918
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,786
You take them over.
I'm running out
of double-talk.

1919
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,055
All right, come on.

1920
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:54,789
Cowboys: * home,
home on the range *

1921
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,091
there they are.

1922
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:58,060
* where the deer and
the antelope play *

1923
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,461
how you doing, boys?

1924
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,663
I'll tell you, partner,
I'm getting mighty weary

1925
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:03,065
waiting for this here
Mr. Donahue.

1926
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:05,067
Me, too! I'm all
for hitting the trail

1927
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:06,668
back to the motel.
Come on!

1928
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,070
Now, now, now...
Wait a minute, buck.

1929
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:10,205
It's like I told you.
Mr. Donahue's delayed,

1930
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:12,207
but he'll be up here
any minute now,
right, Starchy?

1931
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,076
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep your spurs on.
After all,

1932
01:20:14,077 --> 01:20:16,678
you can't expect
pyramid aldatia for
Benson all the time.

1933
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,080
Lay off that gab, will you?

1934
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:20,315
Come on,
come on there, Barney.
Cheer up the boys.

1935
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:23,852
Let's whoop it up, wranglers!

1936
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:27,422
All: * home,
home on the range *

1937
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:28,623
[knock on door]

1938
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:32,694
* where the deer
and the antelope play *

1939
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:36,298
come right in.
Come right in.

1940
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:37,499
Hello, Barney.

1941
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,035
Mrs. Donahue,
what are you doing here?

1942
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,503
Well, I been looking for Gloves,

1943
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:42,637
and I can't find him.

1944
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,506
I been to his apartment
and down to his office,

1945
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,575
and I thought maybe
he might be here.

1946
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,844
He just stepped out
for a little air.

1947
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,246
He'll be right back.
Oh.

1948
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:52,714
Why don't you come on in?

1949
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:53,982
Sit down.
There's a nice chair.

1950
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:55,250
You know the boys, don't you?

1951
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,684
Good evening,
mother!
Hello, ma.

1952
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,153
How are you,
Mrs. Donahue?

1953
01:20:58,154 --> 01:20:59,988
Barney, I'm that worried
about Gloves.

1954
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:01,990
It says here in the paper
that he killed somebody.

1955
01:21:01,991 --> 01:21:04,426
Oh, they're just
trying to build up
circulation.

1956
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,528
Exactly!
Well, I don't
understand it.

1957
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,263
Now, when I come in here
a little while ago,

1958
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,732
there was Callahan
and his boys downstairs,

1959
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:12,367
and they tried to search me!

1960
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,602
What?!
They can't do that
without a search
warrant.

1961
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,138
Say, mother, how about
a little drink, huh?

1962
01:21:16,139 --> 01:21:17,739
Fix you a nice
little glass
of Sherry.

1963
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,141
Oh, no, thank you, Barney,

1964
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:21,176
but I wouldn't mind
a little bit of bicarbonate.

1965
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:23,478
Oh, yes.
Bicarbonate.
I'll get it.

1966
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,014
[All talking]

1967
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,220
[Rustle, thud]

1968
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:40,162
Gloves! Hey, fellas,
it's Gloves!

1969
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:42,365
It's Gloves, fellas,
it's Gloves!

1970
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:48,972
Hey, Marty.

1971
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:55,177
Now, don't start shooting.

1972
01:21:55,178 --> 01:21:57,513
Let me get my mitts
on him first.

1973
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,184
Gloves: So I do
a beautiful swan dive...

1974
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:03,718
Quiet.
Into the east river.

1975
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,054
They don't follow
because they figure
I'm at the bottom.

1976
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:09,224
And that's the story up to now.

1977
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:10,858
What's the idea,
Callahan?
Shut up!

1978
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,794
You've got no right
to break in here
like this, you big--

1979
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,062
keep out of this, Spats!

1980
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:15,330
This is illegal entry!

1981
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:16,831
Gloves has got a date
with the hot seat,

1982
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:18,166
and I'm going to see
that he keeps it.

1983
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:19,567
Son!
It's ok, mom.

1984
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:22,204
Marty, you got me
figured all wrong.

1985
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:24,072
I didn't kill Joe,
but I know who did--

1986
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:25,673
Pepi, your piano player.

1987
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:26,941
Don't try
to tell me--

1988
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,343
that grease ball
is part of a mob

1989
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:29,877
that makes you and me
look like little Bo-peep,

1990
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:32,080
and they been using
your joint to do
their finagling in.

1991
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:33,415
When did you dream that up?

1992
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,017
Sunshine:
That's no dream.

1993
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:37,085
Gloves is referring
to certain parties
from across the pond.

1994
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,686
Yeah. Tracking down
this Hamilton doll,

1995
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,024
I uncovered a nest
of fifth columnists,
fivers, spies to you.

1996
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,958
Pepi was one of them.
That's what Joe found out,

1997
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,527
and that's why
Pepi knocked him off.

1998
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:46,961
Well, if that's on
the level, what are
you telling me for?

1999
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,230
Why don't you spill
it to the cops?

2000
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:50,632
I tried to, but no soap.
Now, listen, Marty.

2001
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,367
I know you're no mental giant,

2002
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:54,102
but try to juggle this,
all of you.

2003
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:56,771
I got a firsthand report
tonight on what it's like
on the other side,

2004
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:59,241
from that Hamilton babe,
and brother, I'm telling you,

2005
01:22:59,242 --> 01:23:00,708
we got to watch our steps.

2006
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,345
Those babies are
strictly no good
from way down deep.

2007
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:04,979
They're no bunch
of petty racketeers

2008
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,381
trying to muscle in
on some small territory.

2009
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:07,915
They want to move in wholesale,

2010
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,284
take over the whole country.

2011
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:11,253
So what?
It don't make
no difference to me

2012
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:13,055
who runs the country
as long as they stay
out of my way.

2013
01:23:13,056 --> 01:23:15,257
That's just it.
They're not going to
stay out of your way.

2014
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:16,724
Oh, yes, they will.

2015
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,160
Aw, now, listen, big shot,

2016
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,661
they'll tell you
what time you get up
in the morning

2017
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,263
and what time
you go to bed at night.

2018
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:22,697
They'll tell you what you eat,

2019
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:24,532
what kind of clothes
you can wear,
what you drink.

2020
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:26,534
They'll even tell you
the morning paper
you can read.

2021
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:28,303
They can't do that.
It's against the law.

2022
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,004
Yes, it's unconstitutional.

2023
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,439
How do we know
you ain't making
this up?

2024
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,041
Why don't you read the papers?

2025
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:34,709
It's on the front page
every day.

2026
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,145
Every order that Berlin
dishes out, these babies
follow through.

2027
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:38,746
Up to now, we've had
only the preliminaries,

2028
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,148
but tonight's the main bout.

2029
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:42,417
We got to
find out what it is
and stop it quick,

2030
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:44,886
and I need your help.
What do you say?

2031
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:46,288
Ok, count us in.

2032
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:47,789
Good.
Give me that coat.

2033
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,891
Cowboy: I'll help you
track down them coyotes,
partner.

2034
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:51,293
I tackled them in 1918,

2035
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,827
and I ain't afraid
to tackle them now.

2036
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:55,297
Me, too. They going
to make a warmonger
out of me yet.

2037
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:56,598
The first one of
those guys I tag,

2038
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:58,166
I'm going to kick him
right in the swastika.

2039
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,434
Callahan:
Where do we go?

2040
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:00,702
That's what I got to find out.

2041
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,170
Spats, you round up
everybody we know.

2042
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:03,438
Barney and sunshine,
you come with me.

2043
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,039
I'll call you back
in a few minutes.

2044
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,441
Mrs. Donahue:
Be careful, son!

2045
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:07,709
Where are we
going to look for
these lugs, coach?

2046
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,911
You said the antique joint
was cleared out.

2047
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:11,313
That's right,
but the kid will know.

2048
01:24:11,314 --> 01:24:12,914
They got her in
the 47th street police station.

2049
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,782
They'll grab you
if you get within a mile
of a police station.

2050
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,050
Don't you worry about that.

2051
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,052
Sunshine's doing
all the interviewing.

2052
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,654
Annabelle!

2053
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:21,055
Barney!
Darling!

2054
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,457
I haven't seen you for so long,

2055
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,058
I didn't know you--
good-bye.

2056
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,460
Where are you going now?

2057
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:27,061
Please try to understand, dear.

2058
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,796
It's a national emergency.
It can't wait!

2059
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,399
Well, neither can I!

2060
01:24:32,335 --> 01:24:33,935
Miss Hamilton?
Yes?

2061
01:24:33,936 --> 01:24:35,470
Ok, sister, get your things.

2062
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:37,205
You're leaving us.
Leaving?

2063
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:38,573
Yeah, you been sprung.

2064
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,542
A friend of yours
just bailed you out.

2065
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:41,609
Oh. Mr. Donahue?

2066
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,211
I don't know, lady.
I just work here.

2067
01:24:43,212 --> 01:24:44,780
Come on.
Get your coat.

2068
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,488
All right, miss Hamilton,

2069
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:55,490
you can go now, but understand

2070
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:57,359
you must stay
within the jurisdiction

2071
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,093
of the court and be
available when called.

2072
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,362
Yes, sir.

2073
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:02,564
Your friends are
waiting outside.

2074
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:03,832
Thank you.

2075
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,840
Make it quick, sunshine.

2076
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:14,443
Keep the motor hot.

2077
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:33,261
Hello, beautiful.

2078
01:25:33,262 --> 01:25:36,732
Jail is no place for
a nice girl like you.

2079
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:44,272
Hey, Gloves! They got
the dame in that car.

2080
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:45,607
What are you talking about?

2081
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:47,809
They sprung her, the fivers.

2082
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,412
Get in. Let's go.

2083
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:19,507
They've went like magic.

2084
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:20,476
Maybe they ducked
around the corner.

2085
01:26:20,477 --> 01:26:21,509
No, they didn't have time.

2086
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,445
We were too close behind them.

2087
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,447
They're somewheres
in this block.

2088
01:26:25,448 --> 01:26:29,183
Look. "Kassler rippchen
eisbein saurbraten mit--"

2089
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,585
what does that mean, coach?

2090
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:33,788
It means we're in
the right neighborhood.

2091
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:35,056
Oh.

2092
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:36,558
Wouldn't it be better

2093
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:42,063
if we just sent
an anonymous letter
to the g-men, huh?

2094
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:43,931
Hey, wait a minute.

2095
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:46,301
Coach...Look.

2096
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:48,470
Where have I seen
that face before?

2097
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:50,071
"Madison novelty
company."

2098
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:51,706
Doesn't that ring a bell?

2099
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:54,609
Yeah. "I.J. Madison
and company" on the sign
at the warehouse.

2100
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:57,413
Boys, we're on the right track.

2101
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,348
Hey, wait a minute.

2102
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:01,949
There's the car.

2103
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,552
That's it, all right.

2104
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:06,488
Yeah, that's the car,

2105
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:08,490
but where are the people?

2106
01:27:08,491 --> 01:27:09,992
[Vehicle approaches]

2107
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:17,499
Say, this might be a lead.

2108
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,302
Duck out of sight.

2109
01:27:26,642 --> 01:27:28,710
I wish I was at 42nd street.

2110
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:30,044
Why 42nd street?

2111
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:31,646
So I could catch a subway home.

2112
01:27:31,647 --> 01:27:32,848
Quiet.

2113
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:26,568
Hey, Barney,
tell Marty and Spats

2114
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:28,370
to hotfoot it down here
with the interference.

2115
01:28:28,371 --> 01:28:30,572
What about you fellas?
You can't impersonate
them two guys.

2116
01:28:30,573 --> 01:28:32,173
We can try.
Go on. Beat it.

2117
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:33,642
Good luck.

2118
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,512
Don't forget us.

2119
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,204
Heil Hitler.

2120
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:04,939
Heil.
Heil.

2121
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:06,941
Your cards.
Cards?

2122
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:08,544
Identification.

2123
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:21,690
Welcome to New York.

2124
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:25,093
This way, gentlemen.

2125
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:38,441
Schroeder und holzmeir.

2126
01:29:40,643 --> 01:29:42,445
[Crowd murmuring]

2127

[Rap rap]

2128
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,259
Ebbing: Quiet!

2129
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,662
We were forced to meet here

2130
01:30:00,663 --> 01:30:03,798
because of an indiscretion
of one of our agents.

2131
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:07,001
Nevertheless, we will proceed
with our operations

2132
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:08,603
according to plan.

2133
01:30:08,604 --> 01:30:11,606
I cannot impress upon you
too strongly

2134
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:14,041
the importance
of tonight's task.

2135
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,811
Our success depends
upon the precision

2136
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:20,281
with which each man
carries out his assignment.

2137
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:21,683
What we have done up to now

2138
01:30:21,684 --> 01:30:23,685
is only the beginning
of our campaign.

2139
01:30:23,686 --> 01:30:25,419
We have laid the groundwork

2140
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,421
for their disruption
and disintegration,

2141
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,525
but now we must
destroy their confidence.

2142
01:30:30,526 --> 01:30:33,961
And we can only accomplish
this by an action

2143
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:38,700
as daring and as bold
as the one planned for tonight.

2144
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:40,301
We must not fail.

2145
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:41,903
All: Sieg heil!

2146
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:43,506
Sieg heil.

2147
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:48,576
Now...The vessel
will sail at 4:27.

2148
01:30:48,577 --> 01:30:51,312
It will proceed
from the Brooklyn Navy yard,

2149
01:30:51,313 --> 01:30:52,714
at a speed of 4 knots,

2150
01:30:52,715 --> 01:30:55,082
to a point in the narrows
opposite fort Henry.

2151
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,251
What vessel
is he talking about?
Quiet.

2152
01:30:57,252 --> 01:31:01,856
At this point,
the speed increases
from 4 to 9 knots.

2153
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,591
And according to our plan,

2154
01:31:03,592 --> 01:31:05,727
the vessel will reach
the minefield

2155
01:31:05,728 --> 01:31:08,462
at approximately 5:15.

2156
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,164
Excuse me, Herr Ebbing.

2157
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:11,432
Yes, doctor?

2158
01:31:11,433 --> 01:31:13,134
5:21, to be exact.

2159
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,603
Based on the coast
guard tide reports,

2160
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:17,872
it is a mathematical
certainty that,

2161
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:19,741
barring unforeseen events,

2162
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:21,743
we can hardly be a second off.

2163
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:23,177
Thank you, doctor.

2164
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:27,550
So the vessel will reach
the minefield at 5:21 exactly.

2165
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:31,485
Steindorff, check the reports.

2166
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,089
I'll be back in a minute.

2167
01:31:40,963 --> 01:31:42,029
What's up?

2168
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:44,298
I don't know, but I got an idea

2169
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:46,100
that somewheres
off there,
we'll find the kid.

2170
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:47,635
Quiet!
Quiet, please.

2171
01:31:47,636 --> 01:31:49,136

2172
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:50,105
Hier.

2173
01:31:50,106 --> 01:31:51,906
Your report please,
Herr Lichdich.

2174
01:31:51,907 --> 01:31:55,042
Arrangements have
been made to control
any interference

2175
01:31:55,043 --> 01:31:57,645
from harbor traffic
on the Staten island side.

2176
01:31:57,646 --> 01:31:59,380
5 men will be on the dock,

2177
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:01,082
one man in each car
on the ferry.

2178
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:04,385
And 3 sailors have
already been stationed
in 3 various positions.

2179
01:32:04,386 --> 01:32:05,987
Very good.

2180
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:07,690

2181
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,727
Herr Holzmeir.

2182
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:15,396
Herr holzmeir.

2183
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:17,198
[Whispering]
What do we do now?

2184
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,667
Once this guy Holzmeir
starts talking,

2185
01:32:19,668 --> 01:32:21,870
we'll duck
out that door.
Ok.

2186
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:25,006

Yes?

2188
01:32:26,609 --> 01:32:28,542
Did Schroeder
and Holzmeir arrive?

2189
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,411
Yes, they were admitted.

Hey, that's you.

2193
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:41,156
What? Oh.

2194
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:44,191
Ja?

2195
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:45,259
Are you Holzmeir?

2196
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,427
Ja.

2197
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:47,829
Didn't you hear me
call your name?

2198
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:49,697
Well, yeah...
I'm sorry.

2199
01:32:49,698 --> 01:32:51,298
I was talking
to my friend, uh...

2200
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:53,067
Schroeder.
Herr Schroeder.

2201
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,070
Did Schiller take you
to the docks tonight?

2202
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:59,073
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Sure, he took us
to the docks.

2203
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:01,843
Good. Schroeder and Holzmeir
have flown in

2204
01:33:01,844 --> 01:33:04,647
from Detroit to help us.

2205
01:33:05,447 --> 01:33:07,181
Your report, please.

2206
01:33:07,182 --> 01:33:08,784
My report?

2207
01:33:09,952 --> 01:33:13,387
Well, all I can say is
it's a great pleasure

2208
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:16,858
to be here
tonight to find out
what you mugs--uh--

2209
01:33:16,859 --> 01:33:19,593
gentlemen have
been doing in this
part of the country.

2210
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,864
It's very enlightening,
to say the least...

2211
01:33:22,865 --> 01:33:25,299
Which reminds me of a story.

2212
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,433
Uh, many years ago--

2213
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,936
we have no time for stories.
Your report, please.

2214
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,939
The report. Well,
if you don't mind,

2215
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,808

till Ebbing gets back.

I don't get you.

you feel about it, ok.

You and Schroeder
are munition experts,
are you not?

2224
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:05,372
Yeah, we--we know a little
something about it.

2225
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,441
I was told you inspected
the mines tonight.

2226
01:34:07,442 --> 01:34:11,512
Oh, yes, yeah.
We gave the mines
the once-over.

2227
01:34:11,513 --> 01:34:13,114
And what's your opinion?

2228
01:34:13,115 --> 01:34:14,982
My opinion?

01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:16,317
Yes.

01:34:16,318 --> 01:34:17,920
Up here, please.

2231
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,394
Now speak up.
Speak up.

2232
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:30,798
Well, uh...
At the moment,

2233
01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:32,399
things don't look so good.

2234
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,868
What do you mean?

2235
01:34:33,869 --> 01:34:38,339
Well...These things
take a little time
to figure out.

2236
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,542
Have you got any ideas,
Herr Schroeder?

2237
01:34:41,543 --> 01:34:43,045
Who, me?

2238
01:34:45,814 --> 01:34:49,817
Well, the way
I figure it is, uh...

2239
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:51,685
Oh, yeah. The stratavan
is on the paratoot

2240
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:52,987
right next to
the mockters prockters.

2241
01:34:52,988 --> 01:34:54,255
That is correct, Herr Schroeder.

2242
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:55,957
The stratavan is definitely
on the paratoot

2243
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:58,092
right next to
the mockters prockters
and 100 feet deep.

2244
01:34:58,093 --> 01:34:59,493
But according
to my calculations,

2245
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:01,695
if we can just keep this up,
we'll be ok, right?

2246

01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:11,139
All: Sieg heil!

2250
01:35:13,008 --> 01:35:16,010
I'm sorry,
but all this seems
rather confusing.

2251
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:17,711
Would you try
to speak a little
more distinctly?

2252
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,381
I said the stratavan
is larasang tatavan
Brooklyn Navy yard.

2253
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:22,116
Apparently this gentleman
does not understand

2254
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:23,851
the technical terms
used in our report.

2255
01:35:23,852 --> 01:35:25,887
Never mind that.
What about
the mines?

2256
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:28,255
Oh, the mines?

2257
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:31,392
Oh, yes...
Uh...Uh, the mines.

2258
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:34,628
Uh...Uh,
what about the mines,
Herr Schroeder?

2259
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:37,631
The mines? Well,
what about the mines?

2260
01:35:37,632 --> 01:35:39,466
Well, didn't you
check the mines?

2261
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:41,435
Who, me?

2262
01:35:41,436 --> 01:35:43,205
Well, uh...

2263
01:35:45,007 --> 01:35:48,009
Oh, yeah! The kansanon
is on the prossapoo,

2264
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:49,944
and the senapot will
equalize the poopanick

2265
01:35:49,945 --> 01:35:52,746
if the gradastan
is on the altar.
And we will win!

2266
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,615
Heil!
Heil!

2267
01:35:54,616 --> 01:35:56,084
All: Sieg heil!

2268
01:35:58,153 --> 01:35:59,753
I'm sure you gentlemen know

2269
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,188
what you're talking about,

2270
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:03,958
but I must ask you
to repeat the whole
thing again,

2271
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:05,960
and this time, very slowly.

2272
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:07,761
The--the whole thing?

2273
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,763
Yes.

2274
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,100
He wants the whole thing.

2275
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:28,582
Well, I--I don't
think that's going
to be necessary.

2276
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:33,187
I think we have here
what we have been
looking for.

2277
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:37,058
It seems like we got
a control station
at rockaway point.

2278
01:36:37,059 --> 01:36:39,326
Looks like we got
another one on the bridge

2279
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:40,928
between Brooklyn and rockaway.

2280
01:36:40,929 --> 01:36:43,230
Not only looks like it,
we--we got one.

2281
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,666
And it looks like
we got a little problem

2282
01:36:45,667 --> 01:36:47,835
up here with the coast guard.

2283
01:36:47,836 --> 01:36:50,838
Oh, we got a battleship
in Brooklyn.

2284
01:36:50,839 --> 01:36:52,840
Looks like we're
planning to sink

2285
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:54,441
a United States battleship.

2286
01:36:54,442 --> 01:36:56,478
[Speaking German]

2287
01:36:57,712 --> 01:37:00,114
Gloves: Yeah, yeah,
I know that.

2288
01:37:00,115 --> 01:37:01,183
I just want to make sure.

2289
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:03,384
Ebbing: Did you tell
the police there was
a meeting here tonight?

2290
01:37:03,385 --> 01:37:04,286
No.
You are lying!

2291
01:37:04,287 --> 01:37:05,786
I--I told them
there was a meeting,

2292
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:07,188
but I didn't know where.

2293
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:08,789
Did Miller tell you
about this place?
No.

2294
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:10,224
She's still lying.

2295
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:12,193
I told you
she and Miller were
working against us,

2296
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:14,196
but you wouldn't listen to me.

2297
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,868
[Speaking German]

2298
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:26,440
What is it?
"What is it?"

2299
01:37:26,441 --> 01:37:28,042
Your friend Donahue
is downstairs.

2300
01:37:28,043 --> 01:37:29,510
Donahue?
How did he get in?

2301
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,178
Well, how should
I know? Why don't
you ask beautiful?

2302
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:33,847
He's not only here,
he's on a platform,
speaking,

2303
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,116
and he knows everything.

2304
01:37:35,117 --> 01:37:36,283
Madame: You fool.

2305
01:37:36,284 --> 01:37:37,985
You've let a pretty little face

2306
01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:39,753
destroy everything
you've worked for.

2307
01:37:39,754 --> 01:37:42,457
You silly, stupid,
blundering old--

2308
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:45,928
keep her here.

2309
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:57,471
Barney: Hey!

2310
01:37:57,472 --> 01:37:59,074
Come on! Come on!

2311
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:05,213
[All talking]

2312
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:18,025
Barney:
It's locked.

2313
01:38:18,026 --> 01:38:19,693
Is there a lock-picker
in the crowd?

2314
01:38:19,694 --> 01:38:23,098
Callahan: Get in here!
We'll go around it. Come on!

2315
01:38:27,235 --> 01:38:32,940
Well...That's...That's
about all I got to say.

2316
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:34,475
Everything's all set,

2317
01:38:34,476 --> 01:38:38,545
and if things go
according to plan...

2318
01:38:38,546 --> 01:38:39,947
We can't miss.

2319
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:41,949
Ebbing: Thank you,
Mr. Donahue.

2320
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:43,951
You caused me
a great deal of trouble.

2321
01:38:43,952 --> 01:38:45,652
This time I'll
attend to you myself.

2322
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,255
Bring him upstairs.

2323
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:49,823
This one, too.

2324
01:38:49,824 --> 01:38:51,358
Hey, take it easy,
will you, fellas?

2325
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:53,261
I'm all run down.
I'm taking pills right now.

2326
01:38:54,963 --> 01:38:56,563
Here we are, Gloves!

2327
01:38:56,564 --> 01:38:57,966
Ok, Barney!

2328
01:39:11,446 --> 01:39:12,713
Heil!

2329
01:39:12,714 --> 01:39:14,316
Heil.
Ok.

2330
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:27,728
Heil?

2331
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:29,331
Heil.
Uh-huh.

2332
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:34,301
Now sing!

2333
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:35,802
What do you want me to sing?

2334
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,339
God bless America!

2335
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:41,742
Heil!

2336
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:43,345
Heil!
Fine.

[Speaking German]

2338
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,241
What do you mean?

2339
01:40:14,242 --> 01:40:15,842
They have broken up the meeting.

2340
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,211
Broke up the meeting?
Who?

2341
01:40:17,212 --> 01:40:19,446
Leda: I'll tell you--
the people.

2342
01:40:19,447 --> 01:40:21,048
The people you despise so much.

2343
01:40:21,049 --> 01:40:22,649
The people you said
you would split

2344
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:23,817
into angry little groups.

2345
01:40:23,818 --> 01:40:25,186
You can't beat them, Ebbing.

2346
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:26,787
You think not?
Never.

2347
01:40:26,788 --> 01:40:28,390
You're finished!

2348
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,958

beaten me yet.

Pepi, you come with me.

2351
01:40:35,097 --> 01:40:36,397
But where are you going?

2352
01:40:36,398 --> 01:40:37,931
We'll do it ourselves.

2353
01:40:37,932 --> 01:40:39,533
What, the two of us alone, huh?

2354
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:40,801
Yes!

2355
01:40:40,802 --> 01:40:42,404
But that's silly!

2356
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,673
I'm not going.

2357
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:48,209
What did you say?

2358
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:50,778
I'm not going.
Suicide is not for me.

Are you all right?

2361
01:41:08,496 --> 01:41:09,863
Yes.

2362
01:41:09,864 --> 01:41:11,632
Oh, that's fine.
Now, listen, kid.
We got them on the run.

2363
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:15,902
They won't bother you
anymore. Where's Ebbing?

2364
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,238
I don't know.

2365
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:19,240
He was here a few minutes ago.

2366
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:20,641
Madame:
I can tell you.

2367
01:41:20,642 --> 01:41:23,410
You'll find him at the docks
near the warehouse.

2368
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:25,379
Thanks for the tip, lady.
I'll put in a plug for you.

2369

Coach! How'd it go?

2370
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:28,382
Coach! Everything
all right?

2371
01:41:28,383 --> 01:41:29,816
Yeah. Take Leda
over to my joint

2372
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:31,685
and turn this dame
over to the cops.
With pleasure.

2373
01:41:31,686 --> 01:41:32,687
So long, kid.

2374

01:42:39,421 --> 01:42:42,423
I hope you find it
interesting,
Mr. Donahue.

2377
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:44,024
Drop your gun.

2378
01:42:44,025 --> 01:42:46,427
Did you hear me?
Drop it.

2379
01:42:46,428 --> 01:42:48,263
Get your hands up.

2380
01:42:49,597 --> 01:42:53,301
Pardon my curiosity,
but what is all this?

2381
01:42:54,202 --> 01:42:55,602
Explosives.

2382
01:42:55,603 --> 01:42:57,604
High explosives,
Mr. Donahue,

2383
01:42:57,605 --> 01:42:59,606
for the newest
American battleship.

2384
01:42:59,607 --> 01:43:02,743
Looks like a little bit
of flash Gordon, to me.

2385
01:43:02,744 --> 01:43:06,647
You don't think you can
sink one of them big boats
all by yourself, do you?

2386
01:43:06,648 --> 01:43:09,216
Why not? One man,
if he's inspired,

2387
01:43:09,217 --> 01:43:11,685
can change the world.
Get into the boat.

2388
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:12,753
What for?

2389
01:43:12,754 --> 01:43:14,888
Since you have been kind
enough to follow me,

2390
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:17,157
I shall take advantage
of your services.

2391
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:18,492
Get in.

2392
01:43:18,493 --> 01:43:20,361
I could very easily
kill you, Mr. Donahue.

2393
01:43:20,362 --> 01:43:22,964
Don't tempt me.
Take the wheel.

2394
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:39,112
And now you will see,
Mr. Donahue,

2395
01:43:39,113 --> 01:43:42,249
what kind of man
the new order breeds.

2396
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,851
Get underway.

2397
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:52,793
You don't think
I'm going to sit here
and drive this canoe

2398
01:43:52,794 --> 01:43:54,661
into one of our
battle wagons, do you?

2399
01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:56,263
If you make one false move,

2400
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:57,798
I'll kill you
and take the wheel myself,

2401
01:43:57,799 --> 01:43:59,533
so you might as well
do as I say.

2402
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:01,668
Them boats ain't made
out of tissue paper.

2403
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:03,404
Are you sure this stuff
is going to work?

2404
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,672
Not even the steel plates
of your battleships

2405
01:44:05,673 --> 01:44:07,741
can withstand
these new explosives.

2406
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:08,710
What do we do,

2407
01:44:08,711 --> 01:44:10,411
dump this stuff
over the side and run?

2408
01:44:10,412 --> 01:44:11,878
There will be no time for that.

2409
01:44:11,879 --> 01:44:13,179
What do you mean?

2410
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,149
We'll strike the ship
the moment the explosion
occurs.

2411
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:17,551
Yes, Mr. Donahue.

2412
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:20,654
In a few minutes,
you and I and Hansel
will die.

2413
01:44:20,655 --> 01:44:22,055
You're not afraid
to die, are you?

2414
01:44:22,056 --> 01:44:23,424
I don't mind dying,

2415
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:26,159
but I hate
to be divided up
into small pieces.

2416
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,762
There she is.

2417
01:44:36,304 --> 01:44:39,440
Now bear toward
the center of the ship.

2418
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:40,974
Now faster!

2419
01:44:40,975 --> 01:44:42,709
Brother,
I hate to tell you,
but you're nuts.

2420
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,178
You fool--it's our
destiny to conquer,

2421
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:46,648
and no one can stop us.

2422
01:44:47,649 --> 01:44:50,183
Go on!
Faster now! Faster!

2423
01:44:50,184 --> 01:44:52,118
Go on!

2424
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:53,955
Faster! Go on!
Faster!

2425
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:10,337
Yes, Mr. mayor.
Yes, sir.

2426
01:45:10,338 --> 01:45:12,739
Donahue's in my office
right now. He's ok.

2427
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,342
That motorboat
smashed into a barge
loaded with lumber,

2428
01:45:15,343 --> 01:45:16,943
made toothpicks out of it.

2429
01:45:16,944 --> 01:45:18,345
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.

2430
01:45:18,346 --> 01:45:19,746
Whatever you say,
Mr. mayor.

2431
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:21,247
Yes, sir, you're right.

2432
01:45:21,248 --> 01:45:23,884
That's what I been
saying for years.
We got to wake up.

2433
01:45:23,885 --> 01:45:25,819
Yes, sir.
I'll tell him right away.

2434
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,020
Yes, sir!

2435
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:28,389
What's up, Forbes?

2436
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:30,357
Yes, how about the D.A.?
What's he going to say
about this?

2437
01:45:30,358 --> 01:45:32,359
Take it easy, boys.
Take it easy.

2438
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,362
Come on. Break it up.
Break it up.

2439
01:45:35,363 --> 01:45:37,097
I've got a message
for you, Mr. Donahue.

2440
01:45:37,098 --> 01:45:38,399
Ok, sweetheart, spill it.

2441
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,933
The D.A. Says

2442
01:45:39,934 --> 01:45:41,768
the charges against you
and your girlfriend
are dropped.

2443
01:45:41,769 --> 01:45:43,770
The chief says
you're a free man.

2444
01:45:43,771 --> 01:45:46,773
And the mayor says
as soon as he can
find his fire helmet,

2445
01:45:46,774 --> 01:45:48,509
he'll meet you at the city hall.

2446
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:49,943
Well, how about that.

2447
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:51,578
Looks like
you're national hero
number one, Gloves.

2448
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:52,813
Reporter: What's
the next stop,
Mr. Donahue?

2449
01:45:52,814 --> 01:45:54,415
Are you invited
to the white house?

2450
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:55,582
Second reporter:
I hear you're going
to work for the F.B.I.?

2451
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:56,817
Well, I'll tell you,
boys--

2452
01:45:56,818 --> 01:45:58,385
how do you feel about
this, miss Hamilton?

2453
01:45:58,386 --> 01:45:59,786
Yes, let's hear your story.

2454
01:45:59,787 --> 01:46:01,922
Well, I feel a little
like the Princess

2455
01:46:01,923 --> 01:46:04,525
who's been
rescued from the dragon
by the white knight.

2456
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:07,528
Aw, that's you, Gloves.
You're the white knight.

2457
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:08,962
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2458
01:46:08,963 --> 01:46:12,733
Anybody that prints that
can expect the usual trouble.

2459
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:13,934
What else?
Go ahead.

2460
01:46:13,935 --> 01:46:15,802
Well, I also feel
it's about time

2461
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:18,271
someone knocked
the axis back
on its heels.

2462
01:46:18,272 --> 01:46:20,474
Excuse me, baby.
What she means is,

2463
01:46:20,475 --> 01:46:24,411
it's about time somebody
knocked those heels
back on their axis.

2464
01:46:24,412 --> 01:46:26,613
See you later,
chief. Mom!

2465
01:46:26,614 --> 01:46:29,282
Hello, son.
Are you all right?

2466
01:46:29,283 --> 01:46:30,551
Sure, I'm ok.

2467
01:46:30,552 --> 01:46:32,018
Oh, something
terrible's happened.

2468
01:46:32,019 --> 01:46:33,086
Yeah?
What is it now?

2469
01:46:33,087 --> 01:46:34,688
5 will get you 10
the milkman disappeared.

2470
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:36,423
How'd you know?
Didn't I tell you?

2471
01:46:36,424 --> 01:46:37,958
It's true.
He didn't come
home last night,

2472
01:46:37,959 --> 01:46:39,693
and I'm afraid
something's
happened to him.

2473
01:46:39,694 --> 01:46:41,428
Oh, what makes you think that?

2474
01:46:41,429 --> 01:46:43,229
Well, son,
I've got a feeling--

2475
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:46,768
all: And when
you've got a feeling,
you've got a feeling.
