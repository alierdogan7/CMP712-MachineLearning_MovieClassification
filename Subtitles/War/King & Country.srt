1
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,012
Here dead lie we

2
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,090
because we did not choose

3
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:52,347
to live and shame the kind
from which we sprung;

4
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,182
Life' after all'
is nothing much to lose

5
00:04:57,234 --> 00:05:01,228
Though young men think it is,
and we were young.

6
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:51,407
Ha' ha, ha. What does
this remind you of?

7
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,285
Remind you of anything?

8
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:58,751
You know when this war's over

9
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:00,373
I think I'll get me
a job in the sewer;

10
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:02,584
well it's the same smell,
the same company.

11
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,590
The perfect soldier.

12
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:06,296
Aye, the perfect soldier.

13
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:07,502
Loved his country.

14
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:09,257
Killed rats.
- Killed lice.

15
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:10,967
Went without food.
- Without drink.

16
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:12,640
Without sleep.
- Without

17
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,183
Went over the top.

18
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:20,105
Killed the Kaiser, won the war.

19
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,524
Home again.
- Honorable discharge.

20
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,524
Fat pension.
- From his grateful country.

21
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:28,276
Women waiting for him.
- Children fondle him.

22
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:31,443
Liquor is free for him.
- He sleeps in the sun.

23
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:36,664
Remind you of anything?

24
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,127
Ha, ha, ha.

25
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:46,462
I suppose they think
I've let 'em down, Corp.

26
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,341
No.

27
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,762
I reckon I'M get a fair trial.

28
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:53,343
Aye.

29
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,675
It'll come out all right.

30
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,136
Aye, course it'll
come out all right.

31
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:14,035
Well I'm sorry this lob had lo
be wished on you, Charles.

32
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:15,361
It's not your fault.

33
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:16,571
If we weren't moving up so soon

34
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,247
I suppose it could all
be a bit more formal.

35
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,165
That would make it all
the more futile, wouldn“: it?

36
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,493
What? Well he is
on trial for his life.

37
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:23,669
That doesn't make
him original we're all

38
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:24,920
on trial for our lives.

39
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:27,044
The only thing that makes him
original is that he's failed.

40
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:29,000
Failed as a man
and as a soldier.

41
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:31,340
The whole blasted
thing's a waste of time.

42
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:33,921
If a dog breaks its back,

43
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,848
you don't sit around
chatting all day, you shoot it.

44
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,800
Er' excuse me, sir.
- Oh yes, come on.

45
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:42,354
What er what were
you like as a child?

46
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,855
The same.

47
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:46,855
Is he in there?
- Yes sir.

48
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:49,691
Er, might I have a
word with you, sir?

49
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,275
He's no idea what
could happen to him sir.

50
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,696
At least, he don't give
no sign of knowing.

51
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,948
I suppose he's bound to know'
he's bound to know what he did;

52
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:02,763
he's bound to know
what could happen to him.

53
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,703
Have you been talking to him?

54
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,166
Yes sir' a bit.

55
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,539
I know it"s laid down
we shouldn't.

56
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:11,713
Shall I come sir?

57
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:14,887
Is it necessary?

58
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,097
No sir.

59
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:32,529
My name's Hargreaves.
- Yes sir, I know you, sir.

60
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:35,191
Do you?
- Trores Wood, sir.

61
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,985
Worlencourt, sir, as well.

62
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:38,990
How long have you been out here?

63
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:41,869
Fourteen' sir.
Best pan of three years.

64
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,412
You know of course
that you are entitled

65
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,077
to the help of a
defending officer.

66
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,087
Oh yes sir. Soldier's Friend.

67
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:51,336
I suppose I can be as much
use to you as anybody else,

68
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,337
subject of course
to your acceptance.

69
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,546
No objection?

70
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,930
Oh no, sir. I'd, er I'd
like to thank you, sir.

71
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,600
It's not as if you
have to do it, sir.

72
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,351
Do you mind
standing to attention

73
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:04,769
when you are
speaking to an officer.

74
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,806
I didn't think it
mattered in here, sir.

75
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:09,434
Well it does matter.

76
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,895
Pull yourself together,
will you?

77
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,579
Now you're Hamp, Arthur James,

78
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,492

Occupation?

00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:30,838
I I'm a soldier, sir.

81
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:33,711
I mean in civilian life.

82
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:36,294
Oh, er
I had a trade, sir, Boot maker.

83
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,172
Hand-made boots.
I come from Islington.

84
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:40,927
D'you know it, sir?

85
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,512
Yes I know it.

Twelve, sir.
Started young, as they say.

cobblers before I was, see.

One, sir. A little boy.

96
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,748
Do you understand why I'm
asking you these questions?

97
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:15,048
You know best, sir.

98
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,086

L, er...

I I'd better ask you some
questions about your

101
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,978
about your home life.

102
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:29,643
Home life?

103
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:34,648
Well, we we never really
had a proper home life, sir.

104
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:37,688
Er, we always lived
with her mother.

105
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:39,023
Did you?

106
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,237
Were you on

107
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,248
sit down, sit down.
- Oh' thank you, sir.

108
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:46,368
Were you on good
terms with your wife?

109
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,327
Has somebody said
something to you?

110
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,820
Would you mind
answering my question?

111
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,246
About the wife?
- Yes.

112
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:03,469
She's took up with somebody
else that's what I got told.

113
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,799
Who told you?
- I got a letter.

114
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,689
A kind friend?
- Yeah, Len.

115
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,687
I see.
- Len Wﬂson.

116
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,349
Lives just a couple
of doors away.

117
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:20,907
Well that'll do for mitigating
circumstances anyway.

118
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:22,237
Sir?

119
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,735
A reason.

120
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,071
An understandable reason.
- Oh.

121
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,409
Did you keep the letter?
- No sir, I hadn't thought.

122
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,249
Did you, er

123
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:42,386

this letter to anyone else?

124
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,640
Yes sir, I did. Yeah.
Er, Willie Bryson

125
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:49,515
Private Bryson in our platoon.
Did you know him, sir?

126
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:51,595
Er er no, I don’t think I do.

127
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:54,185
Oh. Yeah, he got killed,

128
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,608
here at Paschendaele.

129
00:11:57,988 --> 00:11:59,854
Er, did this

130
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:02,440
er, did this trouble
with your wife

131
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:04,070
have anything to do with the

132
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,407
with er with what
you're accused of doing?

133
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:09,322
Er, no. sir.
I never thought of it.

134
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,373
Do you reckon maybe
it was a reason

135
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,326
even if I never thought of it?
- I don't know.

136
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:15,623
Thai's for you to tell me.

137
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,212
Oh.

138
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,629
I see.

139
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:27,094
This kind of story's
so often true that, er

140
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,803
well you you could be lying.

141
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:31,889
And I have to believe you
before I can defend you,

142
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,357
do you understand that?

143
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,147
You can believe me, sir.

144
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,644
It'll come out all right, sir.

145
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:46,234
Why did you volunteer?
- King and Country.

146
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:48,657
Sir?

147
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:52,573
Mm. They dared me.

148
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,709
Who dared you?
- The wife and her mother.

149
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,499
They never thought I'd go.

150
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:01,586
Yeah, I reckon it was that
more than anything else.

151
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:03,258
I wanted to surprise them.

152
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:05,712
They got a surprise
and all when I told them.

153
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,593
And of course er

154
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:11,851
we..we didn't know what it
was going to be like' did we'?

155
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:16,146
Well, I... I didn't
think about it too much

156
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,855
but I suppose you.. you reckon
to yourself in my kind of life.

157
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:21,731
Well, it can't be much
worse than this, you know.

158
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:25,031
Not you. sir. My sort
and most of the lads.

159
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,154
But we was wrong.

160
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:30,820
Up there well

161
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,614
H's worse than
anything, isn't it?

162
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,492
It's no worse for you
than anyone else.

163
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,035
I know that, sir, I know that.

164
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,625
I'm only talking about it
'cause you're asking me.

165
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:45,383
Go on.

166
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,717
Well, when I volunteered we
didn't know any better, did we?

167
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,175
What d'you mean by that?

168
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,106
Well, just a manner
of speaking, sir.

169
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:58,848
You'll have to
learn to be careful

170
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,390
of your manner of speaking.

171
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,980
Yes, sir.

172
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:05,729
Funny thing is

173
00:14:06,908 --> 00:14:08,865
the fellows I come outwith

174
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:11,997
do you know, there's none
of them left except me

175
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:15,204
Loos. “

176
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,117
Loos that was the first one.

177
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,246
It was long side, that one.

178
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,128
Trones Wood

179
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,419
Gommycore

180
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,338
Worlencourt

181
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,264
Yeah.

182
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,471
And now this one here.

183
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:37,933
Passchendaole

184
00:14:38,356 --> 00:14:40,142
worse than anything.

185
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:57,824
Have you been wounded?
- Not properly, sir.

186
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:00,375
I was bleeding a few times and

187
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:02,794
there was one time I
got sent down to a G.C.S.

188
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,501
It was nothing much.
They sent me back the next day.

189
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,967
Of course you hear
of fellows wishing

190
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:11,045
they could lose an arm or a leg.

191
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,927
Same as everybody else.
I've heard of

192
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,516
some of the lads that have
tried it on themselves.

193
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:18,059
Have you tried it'?

194
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,598
Sir?
- Have you tried n?

195
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:24,733
Oh, no sir, no

196
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:27,648
Me and Willie er, Bryson,

197
00:15:27,739 --> 00:15:30,822
we was thinking of trying
it once, but we never did.

198
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:33,950
It... it wasn't long after that,

199
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:36,987
that Willie's number come up.

200
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,872
When? Here?

201
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:44,628
Oh oh sorry, sir.

202
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:47,415
I'm sorry. I've got
to go someplace.

203
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:48,874
Corporal!

204
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,927
Sir.
- Latrines.

205
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,589
Yes sir.
- Go on.

206
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,442
Come on Hamp.

207
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,273
Right wheel.

208
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:11,654
Sergeant, get the rest
of your platoon outside

209
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,106
with their gear for de-lousing.

210
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,532
Come on, out.
- Right, sir.

211
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,280
Gear for de-lousing.

212
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:20,284
All out for de-lousing!

213
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,199
Come on!

214
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,996
Come on outside for de-lousing.

215
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:30,465
Outside with all your
gear for de-lousing.

216
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:31,792
Come on, out!

217
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:37,465
Captain Hargreaves,
prisoner's friend.

218
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,425
Prisoner's friend. A fair trial.

219
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:41,889
A fair trial and a quick death.
- Very funny.

220
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,683
Didn't you think it was funny?

221
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:46,640
Not funny if you're
in Hamp's shoes.

222
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,580
Ready for you, sir.

223
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:08,666
I mm you he was
a strange one, sir.

224
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,333
Attend to that, will you?

225
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,718
I wouldn”: be in Hamp's shoes.

226
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,177
If I'd done it, I wouldn't
have got caught.

227
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,687
Right, get yer
picks and shovels.

228
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,814
I've got a }ob for yer.

229
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,149
They still hanging
around here, sir?

230
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,494
Thanks for the smoke, sir.

231
00:17:54,052 --> 00:17:56,168
Did you expect
to get away with it'?

232
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,847
Well, I wasn't really
thinking about it, sir,

233
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,223
one way or the other.

234
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,222
I just couldn't
stand it anymore.

235
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,392
It wasn't the first time, sir.
- What?

236
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,648
Well, I I nearly
did it once before.

237
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,396
I mean I thought of it.

238
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,311
Time of Worlencourt.

239
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,110
I got sent back
on a water party.

240
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,782
I I was thinking
about getting away

241
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:21,906
but an M.P. got his
eye on me, so I didn't.

242
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:24,988
And that was all?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:28,541
Supposing the others had, er

244
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:33,331
cleared of-f and left you on your
own at Loos or Trone's Wood?

245
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:36,250
I don't think it could have
been much worse, sir.

246
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,591
All right then,
we'll forget about that.

247
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:44,007
Tell me about the the last time,

248
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:45,809
the time you said you
couldn't stand it anymore.

249
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:47,226
What about that?

250
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:50,890
Well, the time this really
started going in my head,

251
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,691
I got blown into a shell hole.

252
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:57,229
Two of the lads pulled
me out with their riﬂes.

253
00:18:58,158 --> 00:19:00,445
Well' I.. I..
I'd seen it happen

254
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:02,109
to a bloke a couple
of days before.

255
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,612
He slipped off the duck
boards into the hole,

256
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:08,495
you see, and he's bobbing
up and down in the mud

257
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:10,622
you know, like an
egg boiling in water,

258
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,373
with his pack on and everything.

259
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:14,296
Well I didn't help him,
nobody did. It's laid down.

260
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:16,840
So of course, when
I gets m the mud

261
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,166
I thought that was my lot, see.

262
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:19,739
I was going to drown
in it, like he did.

263
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,842
Sucked into it,
fighting it, drowning in it.

264
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,641
Oh, after that I couldn't
stand it anymore.

265
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,142
But the battalion was relieved.

266
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:34,726
You came back here for a rest.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:39,067
And you waited ten
days until you went?

268
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:41,273
Yes sir.
- Why?

269
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,993
Like I said sir, I can't
say it any different.

270
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,286
I couldn't stand it anymore.
- What, even out of battle?

271
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:48,493
It didn't matter
where I was, sir.

272
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,077
Any place I could hear guns.

273
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:51,875
There's never anywhere
where you can't hear them.

274
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,076
Yes sir.

275
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,670
Mr' Webb, he knew, he knew.

276
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:57,873
He he gave me extra rum.

277
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:00,209
Did you say anything
to him about it?

278
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,169
Not much, there wasn't
nothing I could expect

279
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,088
a gentleman in his
position to do, sir.

280
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:06,014
What he did,
giving me extra rum,

281
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:08,850
wouldn't have made any
difference to what I did,

282
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:10,351
I knew I wasn't
going to go back.

283
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:12,850
You mean you planned it?

284
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:17,313
No, sir, no.
I didn't have a plan.

285
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:18,693
I haven”: got the sense, have I?

286
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,901
Maybe one time I would
have had the sense but er

287
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,190
<i>mt er</i>

288
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,323
no, it's like being dead, sir.

289
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,329
Why did you wait ten days?

290
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:31,994
I don't know sir.
I didn't have a plan.

291
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,872
I went to the M.O.
that time, yeah.

292
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:38,130
And what did Dr. O'Sullivan
say to you'?

293
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:40,878
He gave me a number
nine sir, for me bowels

294
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:43,548
I spit it out when
he wasn't looking.

295
00:20:44,138 --> 00:20:46,254
Maybe there was
some sort of medicine

296
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,680
that would have helped
me but one thing I

297
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,557
didn't have any need
of was a number nine.

298
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,136
And did he give you
any other advice'?

299
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,392
Well, he said I'd
got cold feet, sir.

300
00:20:54,482 --> 00:20:56,814
He said I was a soldier and
I should be a bloody soldier.

301
00:20:57,151 --> 00:21:00,360
Mind you' I... I Ididn't
expect any different.

302
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:03,943
I didn't expect him to say
anything except what he did.

303
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,694
Why did you so?

304
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:08,280
Well, I thought he might
give me some sort of tonic,

305
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:12,080
something sir, to
stop me diarrhea,

306
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:15,076
stop me shaking, help me sleep.

307
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:17,712
It wouldn't have make any
difference to what I did.

308
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,580
I knew I wasn't going
to go back up the line.

309
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,505
Did you know the
battalion was going

310
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:23,083
back into the line
before you went?

311
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:24,508
Yes, sir.

312
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,922
Is that what finally
decided you?

313
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:30,432
No, sir.
- Then what did decide you'?

314
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:34,516
I dunno.
I just started walking

315
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:37,101
walking away from the guns.

316
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,941
Did you know where
you were walking to?

317
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,317
No... no.

318
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:44,859
After I got a few miles
away from the guns

319
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:47,281
I got it into my head that
I was making for home,

320
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,655
Islington you know.

321
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,410
Er...

322
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:55,199
Er. didn't make any sense but
that's what I got in my head.

323
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,417
I must have walked a long
way because I remember

324
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:04,424
I took me boots off and
me mg toe was kneading.

325
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:10,222
Then I was in a cart
sitting on some potatoes.

326
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:14,556
Then I was in a train and
some fellows was er

327
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:16,637
was was playing cards.

328
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,476
Then I was wanking again.

329
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:23,355
Then I was
talking to this priest

330
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:27,023
but he was foreign. I didn't
know what he was talking about.

331
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:31,781
It... it was like a dream sir.
I... I didn't know

332
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:34,154
what was really happening
and what wasn't'

333
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,831
Weren't you ever challenged?

334
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,829
Only when they picked me-up.

335
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,036
Not till then'?
- Oh' no no.

336
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,705
Didn't you

337
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,007
hide in ditches and things to

338
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,718
avoid them?

339
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:50,671
Oh, no, sir. No no.

340
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:53,055
Did they say anything to you
when they arrested you?

341
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,054
Well, er just about me being a
deserter and I heard one of them

342
00:22:58,147 --> 00:23:00,388
saying to the other about
it being a shooting job.

343
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,022
Nothing else?

344
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,401
Well you see, there's
nobody left in 'A' company

345
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:11,011
that's been out here as long as
me, sir, so they can't shoot me.

346
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,078
<i>It's likely that you will be
found guilty of desertion.</i>

347
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,203
And I'd be failing in my duty if
I left the least shadow of doubt

348
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:20,954
in your mind as to
the consequences.

349
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:22,956
Well I don't reckon
I'll get off, sir, but

350
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,754
they they can't shoot me.

351
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:26,502
Unless I can convince the court

352
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,713
that you were acting
under extra ordinary strain

353
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:30,422
at the time when you
committed this crime,

354
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:33,839
you will almost certainly
be sentenced to death.

355
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:37,437
This was the first time sir.

356
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,182
Mr. Webb; sir' he said I
hadn't been a bad soldier.

357
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,438
He might say the same
to them if he was asked.

358
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:45,567
Yes, he might

359
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:47,454
Yes, I thought that was
worth mentioning, sir.

360
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:51,531
Can you think of anything else
that was worth mentioning?

361
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:54,735
<i>Er no, sir, no.</i>

362
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,908
Did did I tell you about Willie?

363
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:00,118
Bryson yes, you
told me about that.

364
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:02,576
Well, about about when
Willie was was killed?

365
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,661
You told me that
he had been killed.

366
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:07,214
Well, I don't know
if you can, er

367
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:09,750
if you can tell them
about something like that.

368
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:11,363
Well, it's important
for you to tell me.

369
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:15,213
Well you see, I was alongside
of him when it happened.

370
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:19,351
Same as many a time before,
five' six yards away.

371
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:24,936
H wasn't the first time I seen
a man blown to bits of course,

372
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:27,563
it wasn't even as if Willie
was anything special to me.

373
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,561
Well, just a bit, you know,

374
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,104
because he came
from up our street.

375
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,637
But that's all, I mean
nothing special

376
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,026
One thing about Willie,
it was quick.

377
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,619
I never saw it, sir, I was
five or six yards away

378
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:42,290
I turns around and old Willie's
nowhere, except over me.

379
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:47,254
Ooh, I tell you, they had
to get me a new uniform.

380
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:54,127
This is a

381
00:24:54,514 --> 00:24:57,506
this is a question that I may
have to ask you in court, sir.

382
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,974
I'm going to ask you now,

383
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:03,929
If they, er were lenient enough

384
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,727
to send you to prison,

385
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,393
could you be relied upon to do
your duty when you come out?

386
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:13,821
Well I'd try my best. sir.
- I don't mean that.

387
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:18,952
Could you be relied onto go up
the line, and stay up the line.

388
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,665
I mean that exactly,
nothing, less.

389
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:30,081
Do you understand me?
- Yes sir.

390
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,419
Well'?

391
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:35,301
Do I have to tell
you the truth sir?

392
00:25:35,555 --> 00:25:37,011
Could you?

393
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:40,090
Can you tell me sir?

394
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,763
Can you tell me any
way of being sure?

395
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:23,011
Prisoner's ready, sir.

396
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,017
Shouldn't take long, sir.
It's a bad business.

397
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:28,889
Who's in charge of the
er later formalities?

398
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:31,599
One thing at a time,
Sergeant Manor.

399
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:32,934
Yes, sir.

400
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:08,390
Give us a hand with this.

401
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:11,977
What is it? Horse or mule?
- Pig.

402
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,650
If we was left to ourselves,

403
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,607
we'd all be home in bed
having it, wouldn't we?

404
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,742
I didn't say anything about
- Wouldn't we?

405
00:27:22,787 --> 00:27:24,869
You can't win a war
lying in bed, can you?

406
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,788
No but
- So you do what you're told.

407
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:33,336
Doesn't make sense.
- That's not our fault, is it?

408
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:37,958
Keep an eye open: cook.
- Pity to waste it on that lot.

409
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,798
<i>Where's the best bit?
- This bit. Chopper.</i>

410
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:46,014
Knife.

411
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,804
Dixie.

412
00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:59,320
Right, well now we'll see what
we can do for our officers.

413
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:03,779
The Brass have gathered.
- How's Hamp?

414
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:06,783
Oh they've got him all spruced
up like for his wedding.

415
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:08,572
Cut himself shaving of course.

416
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,124
him;

417
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,330
we just push him over
and watch him sink.

418
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,835
They won't do it.

419
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:18,665
Do you think they will, sir?
- No. I think he's had it.

420
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:21,176
I'm afraid he's had his mt.

421
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:30,927
Are you going to get the silly
bastard off, do you think'?

422
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:34,602
He thinks so.
- I hope he's right.

423
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:38,063
I'll shall certainly do my best.

424
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:40,315
Oh don't misunderstand,
my interest is purely personal.

425
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:42,196
I don't want my men
used as a firing squad.

426
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:43,944
And I certainly don't
want to be the

427
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:46,618
Joe Bloody Soap who
has to shout 'fire"

428
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:49,036
Why you?
- Oh I'm number one

429
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,038
on the Colonel's Sweat
List at the moment'

430
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,290
I see.
- When it comes to my turn,

431
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:55,209
I'll perjure myself for
the man if you like.

432
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:57,207
The truth will do.

433
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:59,881
Good luck my learned friend.

434
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:17,315
Prisoner and escort Halt!

435
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:19,730
By the right turn!

436
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,520
Private Hamp cap off.

437
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,070
Corporal.

438
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,996
Prisoner and escort left turn.

439
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:39,336
Quick march left.

440
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,801
Left, right

441
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:52,808
Left wheel

442
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:57,765
Prisoner and escort halt!

443
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:00,478
Left turn.

444
00:30:02,822 --> 00:30:05,280
873426 Private Hamp, sir.

445
00:30:05,908 --> 00:30:08,696
Is that your name and number?
- Yes sir.

446
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,906
Mr Prescott, would
you pass me that?

447
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:18,285
The accused, no. 873426
Private Hamp' Arthur James,

448
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:20,040
Soldier of the Regular Forces,

449
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:22,168
you are charged with

450
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,374
when on active service

451
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:27,586
er... attempting to desert
His Majesty's Service.

452
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,046
In that you absented
yourself from duty

453
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:32,052
without orders from
your superior officer,

454
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:36,262
from approximately 0700 hours
on October 10th this year

455
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,975
at a mace called Jackdaw Tunnel

456
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:41,728
until October the 11th this year

457
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:44,607
when you were arrested by
the military police at Calais.

458
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:47,989
Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty, sir.

459
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,318
Speak up.
- Not guilty sir.

460
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:53,282
Very well.

461
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,322
I have to ask you if you object
to any members of the court?

462
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,658
Myself or either of
these two officers?

463
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:02,503
I am surprised, sir' that
as convening officer,

464
00:31:02,548 --> 00:31:04,414
you are also president
of the Court Martial.

465
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:06,294
There are no other
field officers available,

466
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:08,209
Captain Hargreaves,
I must appoint myself.

467
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:10,420
Are you making a
formal objection?

468
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:11,970
No sir.

469
00:31:12,016 --> 00:31:14,348
You may stand at ease,
Private Hamp.

470
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:16,972
Well sir, I've spoken
to Captain Midgeley

471
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:19,381
and we've agreed that I won't
dispute the facts of the case.

472
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,522
So all the witnesses will
be called by the defense.

473
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,183
Good. That will save
the Courts time'

474
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:29,030
I submit that the prisoner

475
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:31,778
absented himself at a time when,
because of his mental health'

476
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:34,031
he was not fully
responsible for his actions.

477
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:35,703
Mental health,
Captain Hargreaves.

478
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:37,700
Do you mean that
the prisoner is lunatic?

479
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,873
No: sir.
- Or mentally deficient?

480
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:41,576
No, sir.

481
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,120
There must be hundreds
of thousands of men

482
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,206
who are in an
unhappy mental state

483
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:49,546
but who have not absented
themselves from their duty.

484
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:53,254
I realize that sir' fully.
I assure you.

485
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,466
Are you ready for
your first witness?

486
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,925
Yes sir.

487
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:03,230
Call Corporal Hamilton.

488
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:05,061
Corporal Hamilton.
- Sir.

489
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,145
Halt

490
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,691
Hold the Book in
your right hand.

491
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,242
I swear by Almighty God

492
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:16,948
that the evidence I shall
give before this court

493
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,246
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

494
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,622
I swear by Almighty God

495
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,291
that the evidence I shall
give before this court

496
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:24,289
shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

497
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,166
Corporal Hamilton,
I believe that

498
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:27,839
you apprehended the prisoner?
- Yes sir.

499
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,758
What did he say to you?
- Not much, sir. Only

500
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:34,504
Well he tried to tell us he was
going on leave, of course.

501
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:35,713
Yes.

502
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:36,972
A soldier going on
leave is required

503
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:38,390
to carry with him a full pack

504
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:40,597
and equipment, is he not?
- Yes sir.

505
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:42,387
And the prisoner was carrying?

506
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:45,519
Gas helmet, riﬂe
and bandolier, sir.

507
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,395
Wouldn”: have stood much
chance of getting on board

508
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:48,934
a leave ship in that
gear, would he?

509
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:50,274
No, sir.

510
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:51,938
Rather a silly story, wasn't it?

511
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:53,402
Yes, sir.

512
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,282
Then how do you account for it?

513
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,615
Well sir, he could
have, for all I know

514
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:00,450
he could have been just stupid.

515
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,683
Gives us the day off,
though' doesn't it'?

516
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:49,165
I'm not going up to the front

517
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,338
and leave that bloody
bastard behind me alive.

518
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,509
Bloody, bloody rats!

519
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:03,509
Corporal Hamilton,

520
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:05,686
I presume that during
the course of your duty

521
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:07,392
you have arrested
other deserters,

522
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:10,191
of other men who have absented
themselves from service?

523
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:11,859
Yes, sir. Quite a few, sir.

524
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:14,528
Did any of them behave in
the same way as this prisoner?

525
00:34:14,615 --> 00:34:15,946
Much the same, sir.

526
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,195
In particular, did some of
them, to use your own words,

527
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:20,151
did some of them appear
to you to be stupid'?

528
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:22,366
Or behaving as if
they were dazed?

529
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:24,371
Yes sir' I suppose so.

530
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:28,414
In short, was there anything
remarkable or extraordinary

531
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:30,541
about this prisoner
compared with others?

532
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,501
Well, if there had have been
something extraordinary

533
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,416
you would have thought
about it, wouldn“: you?

534
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:39,049
The thing that surprised me sir,
was how he got as far as us.

535
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:41,764
By rights he shouldn't
have had a hope.

536
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:45,101
He must've been through
places thick with patrols

537
00:34:45,187 --> 00:34:47,053
like Poperinghe and that.

538
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:49,723
<i>Perhaps he wasn't quite
as simple as he seemed.</i>

539
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:51,106
No, sir. I didn't mean
- After all, he did

540
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:53,855
get very close to an
embarkation point, didn't he?

541
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:56,779
That's all Corporal, no more
questions. Thank you, sir.

542
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:11,873
Look at that!

543
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:13,458
There must be dozens
of them in there,

544
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,915
and too full to be nippy.

545
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,670
Shall I jump on it?
- No!

546
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:33,941
Right. When I say 'Now'

547
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,818
thump the belly.

548
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:38,274
Now!

549
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:46,780
Captain O'Sullivan,
do you remember

550
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:48,573
the prisoner reporting
sick to you on

551
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,491
or about October 8th
of this year?

552
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,953
On the 7th, yes. I looked it up.

553
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:54,628
Of what did he complain?

554
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,711
I remember quite clearly.

555
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:02,465
He complained of nerves.
- Nerves.

556
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:03,921
He didn't tell you he that

557
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:05,590
he was finding it
impossible to sleep'?

558
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:08,054
He may have.
Yes, I believe he did.

559
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:09,806
But you didn't take
this very seriously?

560
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:12,142
No, ifs not uncommon.

561
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:14,933
It certainly isn't uncommon
for me to be told such things.

562
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,726
You mean you didn't believe him?

563
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,402
Oh I didn't say that.

564
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:19,854
Every Medical Officer hears

565
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:21,734
this kind of thing
five or six times a day.

566
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:23,532
Did you believe this man?

567
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:28,617
' Why r-wot?

568
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:32,750
It seems a permissible question.
- Why not'?

569
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:35,294
Why didn't you believe him
when he said he couldn't sleep?

570
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,296
I didn't say
I didn't believe that.

571
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:41,884
Very well. Of what other
symptoms did he complain?

572
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,552
Well, he said he
was off his food.

573
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,971
Said he was feeling a bit shaky.
- Shaky.

574
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:48,223
Uncontrollable bouts
of trembling?

575
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,553
I don't know about
"uncontrollable?

576
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:54,309
You don'! know about it but
did you bother to find out?

577
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,766
Are you challenging
my competence?

578
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,022
I don't want to interfere with
your defense, Captain Hargreaves

579
00:36:59,112 --> 00:37:00,978
but must you attack the witness?

580
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:03,318
It's not Captain O'Sullivan's
competence

581
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:05,654
which is at stake, sir,
it's this man's life.

582
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:09,992
You said you didn't believe him;
what didn't you believe?

583
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,906
Oh dammit, Charlie,
I knew what he was after.

584
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,037
Did this man lie to you,
and if so what did he say?

585
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:16,710
I knew what he wanted'
to be sent down the line.

586
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:20,214
Did he say so?
- Did he what?

587
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:22,000
Did he ask to be
relieved from duty?

588
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:24,214
Not in so many words,
of course he didn't.

589
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:35,681
And er how long did
this interview last with him?

590
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,598
Five minutes ten minutes.

591
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:40,393
And after that you lost
interest in the man'?

592
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,023
Well what do you
expect me to do?

593
00:37:42,072 --> 00:37:44,404
I haven”: got time for
everyone's emotional problems.

594
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:46,732
But you were sure
that an interview

595
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:49,569
for five or ten minutes was
sufficient for this case?

596
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:52,238
Yes.
- Why were you so sure?

597
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:56,080
Experience. My own judgment,
of course experience.

598
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:03,424
And you usually prescribe
the same treatment?

599
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:06,176
More or Mess. More or less.

600
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:08,588
Laxative pills.

601
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,256
A good dean out
never hurt anybody.

602
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,971
Is that the only relief you can
offer a man, laxative pills?

603
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:15,098
I'll prescribe one
for you in a minute.

604
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:18,105
Captain O'Sullivan,

605
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:20,853
were laxative pills in the
slightest degree relevant

606
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:22,224
to what was wrong with this man?

607
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:25,192
There was nothing wrong
with him and I told him so

608
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,273
Did you? What did you say?

609
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:29,442
I talked to him man to man.

610
00:38:29,786 --> 00:38:33,074
I told him he wasn't the first
soldier to feel a bit jumpy.

611
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:35,865
I told him he'd be alright,
back to normal

612
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:38,955
I told him to try to eat,
to try to get some sleep.

613
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,790
Well what else could I say?

614
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:43,088
I told him to pull
himself together.

615
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,794
Has the incidence
of medical reports

616
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,626
of this sort been
growing recently?

617
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,215
I haven't got
time for statistics.

618
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:52,219
Or diagnoses, it seems.
- No. No, no, no.

619
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:02,353
What are the symptoms
of shell-shock?

620
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:04,481
Shell-shock is a
different matter altogether.

621
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,442
Is there an exact moment
in the life of a soldier

622
00:39:07,491 --> 00:39:09,653
before which he is not
suffering from shell-shock

623
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:11,157
and after which he is?

624
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:15,370
An exact boundary about which no
two doctors will ever disagree?

625
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,366
An exact boundary
on the one side

626
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,246
of which a man is
required by Army law

627
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:22,453
to "pull himself together. "

628
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,921
Or on the other if he cannot,

629
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:27,841
is liable lo be shot as
a criminal. Is there?

630
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,838
This has nothing whatever to
do with what we're all here for.

631
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,852
I must say Captain Hargreaves,
I agree with that'

632
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:36,725
Do you sir?

633
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,352
Then what are we here for?

634
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,722
A mock trial'?

635
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:45,522
That remarks entirely improper,
Captain Hargreaves.

636
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:51,482
I apologize, sir.

637
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:53,863
Proceed.

638
00:40:00,377 --> 00:40:03,369
Does the term 'shell-shock'

639
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:06,713
have an exact medical meaning?

640
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:08,214
Yes, of course it has.

641
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:10,042
And a 'five or
ten minute' examination

642
00:40:10,095 --> 00:40:12,837
is quite sufficient time
in your estimation

643
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:16,432
to judge whether a man is or is
not suffering from shell-shock?

644
00:40:16,518 --> 00:40:19,180
It is not my job to
maintain a Bedlam.

645
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:21,182
God knows you of all people

646
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:23,313
should realize I've got
no time for such rubbish.

647
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,858
Do you expect me to heave
wounded soldiers to die

648
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:28,109
while I cross question cowards?

649
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:33,112
What I am asking is
is there not a borderline?

650
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:35,238
This is not a borderline
case of anything,

651
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,739
how many times have
I got to tell you?

652
00:40:36,788 --> 00:40:38,449
This was a case of cold feet,

653
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,658
funk, miserable funk,
nothing more or less.

654
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,209
Are you sure?
- Yes'

655
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,548
I ask you most earnestly,

656
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,143
are you absolutely sure?

657
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:05,814
How could a man
responsible for his actions

658
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,566
do such a hopeless.

659
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:11,570
Desperately stupid
thing as this man?

660
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:14,774
When they found him,

661
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:18,444
he was trying to walk
home to England.

662
00:41:20,165 --> 00:41:21,701
He might just as well have tried

663
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,624
to clear a German
trench single-handed.

664
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:33,592
Is it not obvious to you

665
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:37,713
that this man had lost
possession of himself?

666
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:43,052
You've made your point,
Captain Hargreaves.

667
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:45,729
Have you any more questions
for Captain O'Sullivan?

668
00:41:47,192 --> 00:41:48,648
No sir.

669
00:41:58,328 --> 00:42:01,286
Captain Midgeley.
- Er, yes, sir, if you please.

670
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:04,665
Captain O'Sullivan, have
any of the Defending Officer's

671
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:07,539
questions altered the conclusion
you came to about the prisoner

672
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:09,836
when he reported to
you on October the 7th?

673
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:11,667
No, not in the slightest.

674
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:14,546
In view of the speculation
we have heard'

675
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:16,877
will you now tell the
court in your own words

676
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:19,179
what that conclusion was?
- Yes'

677
00:42:19,224 --> 00:42:21,010
I found the prisoner
fit for duty,

678
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:22,557
provided he was
kept under discipline

679
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:24,430
and discouraged
from malingering.

680
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:27,183
And there's nothing you wish
to add to your judgment now

681
00:42:27,232 --> 00:42:29,314
by way of qualification?

682
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,351
Nothing whatever. He's
proved me right' hasn't he'?

683
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:34,006
And that's all there
is to say about it.

684
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:37,030
He did tum and run, didn't he?

685
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:39,233
Thank you, Captain O'Sullivan.

686
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:48,454
Were you in the area
between our billet

687
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:50,707
and the cookhouse
at 1600 hours today?

688
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:54,336
Yes, he admits he was in
the area between our billet

689
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:56,375
and the cookhouse
at 1500 hours today.

690
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:00,258
Right Did you or did you not
crawl up to Private Sparrow

691
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:02,134
and take a bite out
of his earhole?

692
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:07,269
No he did not crawl
up the Private Sparrow

693
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:09,062
and take a bite
out of his earhole.

694
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:10,935
Right. Now one last question,

695
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:13,233
if you had been
in our billet today,

696
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:15,269
would you have done
a thing like that?

697
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:19,565
No, he's not that sort of a rat.

698
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:26,489
Captain Midgley, would you like
to cross-examine the accused?

699
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:35,832
You've been telling a lot of
bloody hes' haven'! you'?

700
00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:42,922
No, no, I haven't been
telling a lot of bloody lies.

701
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:47,761
You're just an ordinary rat
who only eats dead ﬂesh, mm?

702
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:52,185
Mm, I'm just a normal rat.

703
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:56,311
Well then, if you're
just a normal rat

704
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:58,736
who only eats dead ﬂesh why,

705
00:43:58,782 --> 00:44:02,446
when all the other rats were
coming out of the front end,

706
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:05,118
what were you doing
coming out of the back end'?

707
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:12,664
Oh, he's crying.
- Ah

708
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:18,457
and after that his
nerve had gone?

709
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,625
Absolutely.

710
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:22,051
I imagine there were
others of your men in

711
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:24,550
a similar condition at that
time; were there not?

712
00:44:25,016 --> 00:44:26,632
Well he must have been
in a worse way

713
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:27,641
than any of the others, sir.

714
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:29,968
But we dent know that he
was in any worse condition

715
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,021
than his comrades;

716
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:33,101
we only know what he
decided to do about it.

717
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:35,607
With respect sir, he
did not 'decide' to do it-

718
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:37,484
if you'll let me carry on..
- Continue.

719
00:44:38,154 --> 00:44:40,566
Was the prisoner popular
in his platoon?

720
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:43,365
Oh yes. He always
shared anything he had,

721
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,946
and he's the nearest
thing we've got left

722
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:47,532
to a founder member, of course.

723
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:49,370
And he...

724
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:50,708
Yes?

725
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:52,783
Well I was just going to say..

726
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:55,869
I don't supose it
matters.. but er..

727
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:59,001
He brewed a damn
good cup of tea.

728
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,382
Was he a good soldier
before this happened?

729
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:06,008
First-class.

730
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:10,059
Near enough. Not a born
soldier' but first-class.

731
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:12,682
And you were surprised when
you heard that he'd absconded?

732
00:45:12,731 --> 00:45:13,812
Oh yes I was.

733
00:45:13,857 --> 00:45:15,188
From what you know of him,

734
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:18,188
you believe he'd have
to be a little unhinged

735
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:19,518
to do what he did?

736
00:45:19,946 --> 00:45:22,187
Yes.. I do.

737
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,696
Thank you.

738
00:45:23,783 --> 00:45:25,945
No more questions sir.
- Captain Midgley?

739
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:27,697
First-class soldier.
- Yes.

740
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,494
His record Is singularly blank.

741
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:31,280
Neither good nor bad.

742
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:34,867
His principal talent as soldier
seems to be in staying alive.

743
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:39,539
Well, surely we're not trying a
man for staying alive, are we?

744
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:41,293
The War hasn't got to
that stage, has it?

745
00:45:41,384 --> 00:45:42,465
Mr. Webb.

746
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:44,463
Hargreaves here is
the sole survivor

747
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:46,090
of an assault on the Somme.

748
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:47,546
They didn't try him for that.

749
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,052
You'll confine yourself to
answering questions, Mr. Webb.

750
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:51,683
I beg your pardon sir.

751
00:45:51,728 --> 00:45:54,561
Mr. Webb, about this
mental unhinging

752
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:56,934
did you see any actual
sign of it yourself?

753
00:45:57,025 --> 00:45:59,141
Well, it depends.
- I mean if it had it surely

754
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:01,226
would have been your duty to see
that something was done about it

755
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:02,735
wouldn't it?

756
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:06,069
Did the idea occur to you
before he went absent?

757
00:46:06,451 --> 00:46:09,569
No.. but he could have been ill

758
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:12,739
in his mind even if I
didn't see it beforehand.

759
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:15,658
Can you offer any
evidence that he was?

760
00:46:16,336 --> 00:46:18,577
<i>He'd had & bedtime.</i>

761
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,668
Er well I don't blame him. We
all get the wind up sometimes.

762
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:23,749
I much prefer a man
to boll beforehand

763
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:26,881
rather than crack up under fire
and endanger a whole platoon.

764
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:29,296
Mr. Webb.

765
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:32,053
Isn't it true to say,
however much we may regret it,

766
00:46:32,102 --> 00:46:33,934
however much we may sympathize,

767
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,431
isn't it true to say
that this man

768
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:38,640
simply allowed his fear
to become his master?

769
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:40,644
There's more in it than that.

770
00:46:41,486 --> 00:46:43,068
I ask you again.

771
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:46,697
Can you recall any evidence
to support what you say?

772
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:49,441
I've said what I believe.

773
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,112
Thank you, Mr. Webb. No more
questions, thank you, sir'

774
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:56,452
Very well.
- Sir.

775
00:47:25,363 --> 00:47:27,946
Got it. Got it!

776
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:30,903
Broke its bloody back!

777
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,491
It's as though the Devil's
got hold of me legs

778
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:42,832
He's pulling me down.
I'm not even wounded.

779
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:45,505
Pm not even wounded but I'm
going to be drowned in the mud.

780
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:48,546
Oh, something had
it in for me, I knew that.

781
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:52,513
Did this idea that the
Devil was after you

782
00:47:53,016 --> 00:47:56,350
did it stay in your mind after
you'd been rescued from the mud?

783
00:47:56,394 --> 00:47:58,806
Not in the same way, sir. no.

784
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:02,268
So it wasn't the Devil.
Then why did you run away?

785
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:04,190
I didn't run sir. I walked.

786
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:07,444
I just started walking.
I dunno why.

787
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:12,320
It's it's not true to say is it

788
00:48:12,368 --> 00:48:16,032
that you deliberately
decided to desert

789
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,742
that you deliberately decided

790
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,289
and hoped to gel away with it'?

791
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:21,896
I wasn't really thinking
about it, sir.

792
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,001
No. I know you weren't
thinking about it.

793
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,787
No but I was hoping they
wouldn't get me, of course.

794
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:26,371
But you really weren't

795
00:48:26,424 --> 00:48:29,166
you weren't clearly thinking of
anything at the time, were you?

796
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:32,211
I just wanted to getaway
from the guns, sir.

797
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:34,838
Had you any idea

798
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:36,841
where you were going?

799
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:38,804
No sir not really.

800
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:41,728
I just wanted to get left
alone for a bit, that's all.

801
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:43,100
Private Hamp

802
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:45,228
you say you wanted
to be left alone for a bit.

803
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:48,106
Does that mean you intended
to return to the battalion?

804
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:51,737
I don't know sir.

805
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:53,069
That's because you

806
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:54,775
you don't remember anything
very dearly, isn't it?

807
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:56,576
That's right sir. Yeah.

808
00:48:57,413 --> 00:49:01,156
You had no clear man or
reason in your mind, did you?

809
00:49:01,251 --> 00:49:02,867
I just started going, sir.

810
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:05,081
I, ya know I couldn't
help myself.

811
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:07,962
Well

812
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,874
like you told me to say, sir,

813
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:13,168
I was acting under
extraordinary strain

814
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:20,347
I er... I er, can't think of
anything else sir.

815
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,557
Is it all right if I ask
you a question, sir?

816
00:49:23,606 --> 00:49:25,017
Yes, carry on.

817
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:27,224
Well, I, I'd sooner
you tell them sir.

818
00:49:27,277 --> 00:49:29,439
You know more about it than me.

819
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,066
All right.

820
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:34,523
Any more questions,
Captain Harreavcs?

821
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:36,483
No, thank you sir.

822
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:38,034
Captain Midgley.

823
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:39,782
Private Hamp,

824
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:43,578
did you know you were doing
wrong when you deserted?

825
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:45,586
If anyone'd tried to stop
me I'd have stayed, sir.

826
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:47,624
Well didn't you wait until you'd
made sure that there was nobody

827
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:48,916
thereto stop you'?

828
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:51,957
No, er, well I think
I was just lucky, sir.

829
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,501
That's very much
a matter of opinion.

830
00:49:55,013 --> 00:49:57,220
Look' what I really
want to know is this.

831
00:49:57,307 --> 00:50:00,299
You did know, didn't
you, that it was your duty

832
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:02,475
to stay with your battalion?

833
00:50:03,062 --> 00:50:04,348
Yes sir.
- And you must have been

834
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,972
very well aware of that all
the time you were absent

835
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:09,433
from the first moment
you decided to

836
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:11,647
decided to have.

837
00:50:12,405 --> 00:50:14,112
I I don't know sir.

838
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,197
But you could walk, talk

839
00:50:16,284 --> 00:50:18,150
think like anybody else.

840
00:50:18,202 --> 00:50:20,364
And you managed to get
quite a long way, didn't you?

841
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:22,287
Like I just said, sir,
I was lucky.

842
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,532
Well let me put this
to you quite simply,

843
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:27,834
did you know
what you were doing?

844
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,292
I I knew what I was doing, sir

845
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:33,207
And you realized that you
were leaving your comrades

846
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:35,338
at their posts who were
prepared to do their duty

847
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:36,626
while you deserted them.

848
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:39,762
Didn't you? Didn't you?

849
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:42,637
I've never done this before sir.
This was the first time.

850
00:50:47,106 --> 00:50:48,892
No more questions sir.

851
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:51,357
That'll do, Private Hamp

852
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,702
Captain Hargreaves will you
address the court now

853
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:04,283
on the prisoner's behalf?

854
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:05,830
No sir.

855
00:51:06,918 --> 00:51:10,377
I will address the court
on its behalf.

856
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:15,044
The prisoner, when he did the
thing for which he's being tried

857
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:17,585
was no longer responsible
for his actions.

858
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,512
This court is responsible
for its actions.

859
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:22,138
It has not lost
possession of itself.

860
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:24,466
This Court knows clearly
what it's doing.

861
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,552
This Court has the
power to choose.

862
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,942
Private Hamp is not a liar.

863
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:37,771
He's not glib, he has
no ready answers.

864
00:51:37,865 --> 00:51:39,947
He has an embarrassing honesty

865
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:41,752
which made him a bad
witness in his own case.

866
00:51:42,245 --> 00:51:43,906
He could have put a
bullet through his leg and

867
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:46,829
suffered nothing more serious
than a term of imprisonment.

868
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,620
He even told me he
thought of doing so.

869
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:51,543
But he didn't.

870
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,495
He stayed.

871
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,417
A deserter in full consciousness
of what he is doing,

872
00:51:58,886 --> 00:52:01,218
runs away to save his own skin

873
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:04,097
and leaves his fellows to do the
fighting and the dying for him.

874
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,432
This man is not a deserter.

875
00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:08,426
He volunteered.

876
00:52:09,105 --> 00:52:12,097
He volunteered because
his wife and her mother

877
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:14,098
dared him to.

878
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,943
Never mind - he volunteered.

879
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:19,279
He's been out here
for three years.

880
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:22,107
Longer, if I may say so,
than some of us have been.

881
00:52:22,493 --> 00:52:24,234
He's seen it all.

882
00:52:25,204 --> 00:52:27,445
A man can only take so much.

883
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,498
So much blood.

884
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:33,083
So much filth.

885
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:34,745
So much dying.

886
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:38,085
In the shell hole

887
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:39,295
he thought he was
drowning in the mud

888
00:52:39,343 --> 00:52:40,959
He thought his time had
come and it had.

889
00:52:42,305 --> 00:52:45,593
After that he was no longer
responsible for his actions.

890
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:49,134
He hadn't got the power to
decide whether to stay or to go.

891
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:53,555
He had one instinct only left

892
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,266
the instinct to walk.

893
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,607
To walk home To walk
away from the guns.

894
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:04,199
They've become a
fact of our daily lives.

895
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:07,657
So much so that we
no longer ask each other

896
00:53:07,747 --> 00:53:09,237
why they're being fired.

897
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,033
Is this war so old

898
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:15,580
and are we so old in it

899
00:53:16,506 --> 00:53:18,122
that we've forgotten?

900
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:21,792
Are we not fighting

901
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:24,927
to preserve some
notion of decency?

902
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:28,430
Some notion of justice?

903
00:53:28,518 --> 00:53:31,180
To preserve for this Court

904
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:33,766
the right to choose?

905
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:47,447
I beg to remind the Court, if
justice is not done to one man,

906
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:50,700
then other men are
dying for nothing.

907
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,721
Matter of opinion.

908
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:22,398
Prescott.

909
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:25,401
You as our legal member
advise the court on the law

910
00:54:25,491 --> 00:54:27,448
as it applies to this case.

911
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,492
The Court will remember
that the soldier

912
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,950
takes the law of England
with him wherever he goes,

913
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:38,375
and he's protected by it.

914
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:41,417
The accused does not have
to prove himself innocent;

915
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:43,589
the prosecution
must prove him guilty.

916
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,968
If the members of the Court
have any reasonable doubt

917
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:49,720
but it must not be
a fanciful doubt,

918
00:54:49,974 --> 00:54:52,511
they must give him
the benefit of it.

919
00:54:52,977 --> 00:54:55,969
You have before you the opinion
of the Battalion Medical Officer

920
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:57,543
which is that at the
time the prisoner

921
00:54:57,607 --> 00:55:00,190
left the Battalion
he was fit for duty

922
00:55:00,276 --> 00:55:02,768
and was not shell shocked
but only suffering

923
00:55:02,862 --> 00:55:05,103
from what the doctor
described as 'cold feet. '

924
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:08,773
You must not be unduly swayed

925
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:10,859
by the eloquence of
the Defending Officer,

926
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:14,286
who has quite properly made
out the best case he can.

927
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:17,791
If doubt that the prisoner
really meant to desert,

928
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:20,995
and you believe that he merely
went absent without leave

929
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:22,954
and intended to return
after a few days,

930
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,543
you will give a
verdict accordingly.

931
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,290
On the other hand,

932
00:55:26,344 --> 00:55:28,802
if you are satisfied that the
prisoner really deserted,

933
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:31,883
it is your duty
to find him guilty.

934
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:35,300
As to the stress the
Defending Officer

935
00:55:35,353 --> 00:55:37,344
laid upon the prisoner
being a volunteer,

936
00:55:37,563 --> 00:55:40,555
neither must you be
unduly swayed by that.

937
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:42,807
The Army is now composed of

938
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:45,644
regulars, of volunteers
and of conscripts,

939
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:48,233
and one law applies to them all.

940
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:53,701
And it is the Court's duty to
administer the law as it stands.

941
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:01,910
We will proceed immediately to
our discussion of the case.

942
00:56:02,004 --> 00:56:03,586
Private Hamp, 'shun.
- Thank you Captain Midgley,

943
00:56:03,673 --> 00:56:05,163
Captain Hargreaves.

944
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:11,594
Escort fall in on the
right of the prisoner.

945
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:15,674
Prisoner and escort left turn.

946
00:56:15,726 --> 00:56:19,594
Quick march. Left right,
left, right left

947
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,202
Thanks for cutting
my throat, old boy.

948
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,199
Well you were overdoing
it a bit, I couldn't help n.

949
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:39,405
I thought there was a great deal

950
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,780
in what you said
if I may say so.

951
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:43,042
Thank you.
- You did very well, Hargreaves,

952
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:45,294
I hope you got him off.
- I hope so too.

953
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:47,839
But you know, a proper
Court is concerned with law.

954
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:50,420
Ifs a bit amateur
to plead for justice.

955
00:57:00,062 --> 00:57:01,723
What do you want now, then?

956
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:04,396
Have you seen my rifle, Corp?

957
00:57:05,443 --> 00:57:07,400
Well why would you
be wanting that?

958
00:57:07,445 --> 00:57:10,187
Well I just thought I
might give it a clean.

959
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,105
You know, something to do.

960
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:20,325
The way they did the Court
Martial it could be anybody

961
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:23,659
You know, I kept forgetting
they was talking about me.

962
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:28,330
Er er Mr. Hargreaves,
he gave them a lovely speech.

963
00:57:28,924 --> 00:57:31,256
"This man is not a deserter. "

964
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:36,550
Oh...

965
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:39,223
You've been twice since
you got back already.

966
00:57:39,268 --> 00:57:40,758
It's not my fault, is it?

967
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:42,593
Right. Guard.

968
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:43,928
Corporal.
- Latrine'

969
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:46,813
Right wheel

970
00:57:52,948 --> 00:57:54,564
Help yourself, Mr. Morris.

971
00:57:57,787 --> 00:57:59,494
Stand easy, Mr. Prescott.

972
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,117
Hm. Mr' Morris wishes to know

973
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:06,034
whether we can find the prisoner
guilty and recommend mercy.

974
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:07,584
Yes sir, you may.

975
00:58:07,963 --> 00:58:10,796
And you may either confirm
the sentence yourself

976
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:13,792
or send it to a higher
authority for confirmation.

977
00:58:13,844 --> 00:58:15,255
I see.

978
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:18,171
Mr Prescott. Never mind.
- Thank you.

979
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:21,053
Er would you help Captain
Cartwright prepare a finding?

980
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:24,056
Er guilty of desertion but

981
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:26,934
emphasize good conduct, length
of service' that kind of thing

982
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:29,269
but don't put in anything
about mental health.

983
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:31,480
They're not interested in that
sort of thing at Headquarters.

984
00:58:31,529 --> 00:58:33,489
When you've finished,
have it read to the prisoner

985
00:58:33,531 --> 00:58:35,488
and then send it
off for confirmation.

986
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:36,989
Right, gentlemen.

987
00:58:58,097 --> 00:59:00,008
Won't know anything
for a bit yet.

988
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:01,681
It's got to go to the
Generals and that lot.

989
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:02,882
It'll be a week then.

990
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,014
They're all pinned down
in Paris, you know.

991
00:59:05,104 --> 00:59:06,970
What's Hamp thinking, I wonder.

992
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:08,888
If he's got any sense,
he's not thinking

993
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:11,520
Whatever happens he's
not going up the line again.

994
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:12,684
Do you know what he
said when he got back?

995
00:59:12,778 --> 00:59:14,519
"They're taking a lot
of trouble over me. "

996
00:59:14,572 --> 00:59:15,983
Feels bloody honored, he does.

997
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:18,773
Yes, they're taking twenty
four hours to kill him.

998
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:20,233
Jerry wouldn't take that long.

999
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:21,863
He'll get the glasshouse.

1000
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:41,254
Captain Hargreaves, sir.
- Yes.

1001
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:42,463
I don't know if
it's allowed, sir,

1002
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:44,014
but he says he'd
like to see you.

1003
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:47,260
Who?
- Private Hamp, sir.

1004
00:59:48,731 --> 00:59:50,722
Would that be legal,
Mr. Prescott?

1005
00:59:50,816 --> 00:59:53,399
Well, I I'm afraid it would
be highly irregular, sir.

1006
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:55,146
It would be kind.

1007
00:59:57,406 --> 00:59:59,147
All right, I'm coming.

1008
01:00:11,629 --> 01:00:14,246
Yes.
- Messages for the Colonel, sir.

1009
01:00:14,298 --> 01:00:16,710
I see. Come with me.

1010
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:25,924
Excuse me, sir. Message, sir.
- Ah, thank you Mr. Webb.

1011
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:31,850
Er go and get yourself
something to eat, Corporal.

1012
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:33,431
Thank you, sir.

1013
01:00:39,198 --> 01:00:41,280
Gentlemen, your
attention, please.

1014
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:43,786
The Battalion will be
moving into the line

1015
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:46,076
tomorrow morning at 06:00 hours.

1016
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:47,532
We will be reinforcing
a battalion

1017
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:48,954
of the Munster Fusiliers.

1018
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:51,957
Captain Cartwright, would you
ask all Company Commanders

1019
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:55,461
to come to my billet after
dinner at er... 20:00 hours?

1020
01:00:55,547 --> 01:00:57,003
Right, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

1021
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:38,121
Well, Hamp?

1022
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:45,511
Sir.

1023
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:51,601
Er.. it's just that I'd
like to thank you, sir.

1024
01:01:52,396 --> 01:01:54,137
Er, in case er

1025
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:58,483
well you know I expect I'll
get put in military prison,

1026
01:01:58,527 --> 01:02:02,270
you know, and er in case
I don't see you for a while.

1027
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:08,610
We, er we don't know
where you'll be put,

1028
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:11,199
if you're put anywhere.

1029
01:02:12,374 --> 01:02:15,287
Well anyway, sir, I I wouldn't
like to miss thanking you

1030
01:02:15,711 --> 01:02:17,497
You've taught me
a lot of things, sir,

1031
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:19,287
and I'm very grateful.

1032
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:21,706
Have I?

1033
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:24,755
Rather too late, I fear.

1034
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,300
AH right, thank you.

1035
01:02:33,437 --> 01:02:35,053
You, er...

1036
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:37,972
you haven't heard anything,
have you, sir?

1037
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:39,523
No.

1038
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,898
I mean, after what you said
they couldn't help but

1039
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:45,855
well it was the truth.

1040
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:48,115
That's what I'm trying to say.

1041
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:49,909
Nearly everything you said
I could never have said it.

1042
01:02:49,995 --> 01:02:51,235
No, I mean it sir.

1043
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:53,909
<i>It was my duty to s ay it.</i>

1044
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:55,455
Oh, I don't know
about that, sir.

1045
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:57,078
It was my duty.

1046
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:59,205
If you'd remembered your duty

1047
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:01,746
none of this idiotic rigmarole
would have been necessary.

1048
01:03:02,257 --> 01:03:04,919
Cant you get that
into your head.

1049
01:03:06,136 --> 01:03:08,594
Don't thank me
for doing my duty.

1050
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,546
I had to

1051
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,222
just as you should
have done yours'

1052
01:03:18,357 --> 01:03:19,939
Yes, sir.

1053
01:03:30,035 --> 01:03:33,778
It's not as if I haven't thought
about it, sir I have.

1054
01:03:34,832 --> 01:03:36,698
I know what they could do to me.

1055
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:39,495
It's just that er

1056
01:03:40,379 --> 01:03:43,121
I wouldn't be thinking
I stood a chance

1057
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:44,629
if it hadn't been for you.

1058
01:03:48,053 --> 01:03:49,794
Prisoner shun.

1059
01:03:51,473 --> 01:03:53,134
With your permission, sir.

1060
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:56,266
Yes.

1061
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:59,638
Private Hamp, A.J.,

1062
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:02,599
Number 873426,

1063
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:05,067
it is my duty to inform you that

1064
01:04:05,154 --> 01:04:07,065
the General Officer
Commanding in Chief

1065
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:09,488
has confirmed the sentence

1066
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:11,615
passed on you by the
Field General Court Martial.

1067
01:04:13,954 --> 01:04:16,286
You will suffer
death by shooting

1068
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:20,620
on Thursday, October 22nd,
at 05:30 hours.

1069
01:04:35,517 --> 01:04:37,508
When's that sir?

1070
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,851
Tomorrow.

1071
01:06:16,868 --> 01:06:18,609
More wine, Midgley?

1072
01:06:18,996 --> 01:06:22,205
Er no thank you sir.
Would you excuse me now, sir?

1073
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,873
Yes of course.
- Thank you, sir.

1074
01:06:46,023 --> 01:06:48,014
Some Haig over there.

1075
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:07,658
Pure chlorine.

1076
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,581
Oh, beg your pardon sir.

1077
01:07:37,032 --> 01:07:39,364
Rather shod on ceremony,
aren't we?

1078
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:45,158
Yes, sir.

1079
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:48,408
I had too much of that today.

1080
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,161
You know the verdict?

1081
01:07:54,091 --> 01:07:55,832
Just now.

1082
01:07:57,219 --> 01:07:58,755
You lost.

1083
01:08:06,228 --> 01:08:08,310
We all lost.

1084
01:08:12,442 --> 01:08:14,183
We're bloody murderers.

1085
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:17,228
Don't be idiotic, Charles.
Pull yourself together.

1086
01:08:17,322 --> 01:08:19,563
Pull yourself together
pull yourself together.

1087
01:08:19,658 --> 01:08:21,774
That's what they
said to him today.

1088
01:08:22,411 --> 01:08:24,903
Pull yourself together, you're
talking like a bloody doctor.

1089
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:28,664
Aren't we rather
overstepping, old boy?

1090
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,990
All right.

1091
01:08:32,546 --> 01:08:34,002
I'm sorry.

1092
01:08:46,351 --> 01:08:48,558
But er why?

1093
01:08:49,438 --> 01:08:50,769
Hm?

1094
01:08:51,106 --> 01:08:52,767
Actually why?

1095
01:08:53,358 --> 01:08:55,474
Why?
- Mm.

1096
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:58,436
Was it O'Sullivan's evidence?

1097
01:08:58,488 --> 01:09:00,024
You know he's an idiot.

1098
01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:04,908
Was was it my defense?

1099
01:09:06,913 --> 01:09:09,280
I... I did my best.

1100
01:09:09,624 --> 01:09:11,581
Very eloquent, Charles.

1101
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,583
But nothing to
do with the facts.

1102
01:09:13,795 --> 01:09:15,832
Facts, facts, facts.

1103
01:09:15,922 --> 01:09:17,378
You 're going to shoot
that poor little bastard

1104
01:09:17,466 --> 01:09:18,956
simply because he
went for a walk.

1105
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,842
That's all it was, you know.

1106
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:25,925
It was a technical
desertion but just a

1107
01:09:26,933 --> 01:09:28,640
a bloody little walk, really.

1108
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:31,806
And you know it.

1109
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:37,732
Don't you?

1110
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,651
These facts

1111
01:09:40,614 --> 01:09:42,946
“your battalion
moving up tomorrow

1112
01:09:42,991 --> 01:09:45,073
important to maintain morale.

1113
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:48,490
Sentence of death to be
carried out immediately. "

1114
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,164
0 my God.

1115
01:09:55,879 --> 01:09:58,416
Pour encourager les autres, eh?

1116
01:10:00,675 --> 01:10:02,962
Has it ever encouraged anyone?

1117
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,302
Discouraged anyone?

1118
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:07,429
Of course it has.

1119
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,176
Are you sure'?

1120
01:10:14,898 --> 01:10:16,764
No not quite.

1121
01:10:36,378 --> 01:10:38,244
Who's in charge tomorrow?

1122
01:10:38,588 --> 01:10:40,329
Jack Webb.

1123
01:10:40,382 --> 01:10:43,591
His man, his platoon,
his mistake. Teach him a lesson.

1124
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:47,344
By the way, I've written
the next of kin letter,

1125
01:10:47,681 --> 01:10:50,048
<i>I wonder would you mind giving
it to Webb as you go out?</i>

1126
01:11:10,954 --> 01:11:13,286
“There's a porpoise
close behind me

1127
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:18,742
And it's treading on my tail“

1128
01:11:19,045 --> 01:11:20,376
Huh?

1129
01:11:21,756 --> 01:11:23,292
Facts.

1130
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:27,839
"When I am buried and
all my thoughts and acts

1131
01:11:27,929 --> 01:11:30,421
Will be reduced to lists
and dales and facts,

1132
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:33,928
And long before this
wondering ﬂesh is rotten

1133
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:37,436
The dates that made
me will be all forgotten. "

1134
01:11:59,669 --> 01:12:01,125
Hamp!

1135
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:04,333
Hamp!

1136
01:12:07,135 --> 01:12:09,126
Is that you, Corp?
- Aye.

1137
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:10,676
Now listen up.

1138
01:12:10,764 --> 01:12:13,973
Wilson and your lot, they've
been nicking some rum.

1139
01:12:14,017 --> 01:12:16,099
Oh.
- Aye.

1140
01:12:16,144 --> 01:12:19,136
We've got some of the
good stuff and all, mate.

1141
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,688
Thinking about a booze
up tonight, you know.

1142
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:24,353
Well I thought you
were bringing it.

1143
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:26,355
No.
- Well where's rest of them?

1144
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:28,904
Coming.
- You'll get into trouble

1145
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,027
No to heH with that, man.

1146
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:38,454
Shut the door.

1147
01:12:46,132 --> 01:12:48,464
What's this for, then?
Somebody's birthday?

1148
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,892
Is he very religious?

1149
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:44,893
I don't think so. Official
C. of E but

1150
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:47,569
You'll be staying with him
right through the night?

1151
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:49,313
Of course, if he's willing.

1152
01:13:49,404 --> 01:13:51,111
Yes, well, I've laid on

1153
01:13:51,197 --> 01:13:54,064
something which might
prove just as useful

1154
01:13:54,117 --> 01:13:56,074
How does the idea strike you?

1155
01:13:57,537 --> 01:13:59,403
It's not for me to say.

1156
01:13:59,456 --> 01:14:01,538
Well I've spoken to the 0.0.

1157
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:04,416
It's left to his discretion
and he's left it to me.

1158
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,424
So he said

1159
01:14:16,473 --> 01:14:19,932
he said, that man in
bed with my wife

1160
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:21,554
was me.

1161
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,272
Was me.

1162
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:42,787
There is no disgrace
no disgrace at all.

1163
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:46,788
Here today gone tomorrow.

1164
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:50,037
It doesn't mailer
who kills you, does n?

1165
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:53,173
Well you know, you

1166
01:14:53,384 --> 01:14:57,298
you've lived a long life,
Hamp, and you're due.

1167
01:14:58,598 --> 01:15:01,716
You'll rot tn the mud,
and that's that.

1168
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:04,934
It doesn't matter what anyone
bloody well thinks about it,

1169
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:06,310
does it?

1170
01:15:07,148 --> 01:15:10,311
Hey, we're all moving up soon.

1171
01:15:11,528 --> 01:15:14,316
We'll be in the same
boat as you are.

1172
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:17,947
We'll all be rat food,
before long.

1173
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:24,993
Last drink in bottle.

1174
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:27,328
Who's going to get it?

1175
01:15:30,296 --> 01:15:32,503
You'd think I
was entitled to it.

1176
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:03,117
Fire!

1177
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:10,329
Come on. Come on.
- Right' Come on.

1178
01:16:30,064 --> 01:16:31,600
Come on.

1179
01:16:47,624 --> 01:16:50,036
Give it here.
- Come on'

1180
01:16:57,926 --> 01:16:59,508
All right, open up.

1181
01:17:09,395 --> 01:17:12,387
Where are you, you bastards?

1182
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:41,966
Will you let me try to help you?

1183
01:17:43,763 --> 01:17:45,754
Do you want to talk to me?

1184
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:51,552
God decides when it is
our turn to be taken to him.

1185
01:17:53,773 --> 01:17:56,310
Will you be absolved
of your sins?

1186
01:17:57,568 --> 01:17:59,104
<i>My sins?</i>

1187
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:04,364
My son, despise not thou
the chastening of the Lord,

1188
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,487
nor faint when thou
art rebuked of him.

1189
01:18:06,577 --> 01:18:09,911
For whom the Lord loveth,
he chasteneth,

1190
01:18:09,998 --> 01:18:13,332
and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth.

1191
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:15,704
Our Lord Jesus Christ,

1192
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:18,833
who has left power to his
church to absolve all sinners

1193
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:22,382
who truly repent and believe
in him of His great mercy

1194
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:24,675
forgives thee thine of fences

1195
01:18:24,721 --> 01:18:27,804
and by His authority
committed to me;

1196
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:30,591
I absolve thee from all thy sins

1197
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:32,847
in the name of the Father,

1198
01:18:32,937 --> 01:18:36,350
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.

1199
01:18:39,819 --> 01:18:43,357
We do not presume to come to
this thy table, 0 merciful Lord,

1200
01:18:43,406 --> 01:18:45,272
trusting in our own
righteousness,

1201
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:48,279
but in Thy manifold
and great mercies.

1202
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:50,155
We are not worthy so much

1203
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:52,946
as to gather the crumbs
from under Thy table

1204
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:55,499
But Thou art the same Lord

1205
01:18:55,543 --> 01:18:58,205
whose property is
always to have mercy.

1206
01:18:58,296 --> 01:19:01,038
Grant us therefore,
gracious Lord,

1207
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:04,833
so to eat the ﬂesh of thy
dear Son Jesus Christ

1208
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:06,502
and to drink his blood

1209
01:19:06,554 --> 01:19:10,047
