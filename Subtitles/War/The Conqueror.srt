Know this, woman.
I take you for wife.

173
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,457
Is Temüjin so wanting
for a woman that he will
quench his fire with ice?

174
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,399
You had no love for Targutai.
This l"d swear.

175
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:48,003
So I must be overwhelmed
by Temüjin, flattered
by his drunken ardor,

176
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,947
<i>returning</i>
<i>kiss for kiss.</i>

177
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,180
The least of my slaves
will give you more pleasure,
Mongol.

178
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,953
Guard!

179
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,465
Lord?
Take this captive
to her tent.

180
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,467
Come.

181
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,932
[Panther Snarls]

182
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,948
Woman!

183
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,576
[Whispering]
Jamuga.

184
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,355
Jamuga!
[Gasps]

185
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,916
Lord, my mistress
wishes to speak with you.

186
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,588
Bortai? Where is she?

187
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,756
A captive in her tent,
my Lord,

188
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,767
else she would
have come to you.

189
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,999
Come.

190
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,859
What mischief do you want
of me, woman?
Mischief?

191
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,267
Temüjin did not think
it mischief...
until I refused him.

192
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,145
You I would not refuse,
Jamuga.

193
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:10,610
Suppose, having taken
your favors,

194
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,884
I refuse the favor
you seek?

195
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,985
Then I would reveal
your betrayal to Temüjin.

196
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,691
Horses for me and
my slave woman, and safe
conduct out of this camp.

197
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,163
Is that so much?

198
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,068
I am tempted, woman.

199
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,081
Tempted above all
to let you go from here,

200
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,983
for you will bring sorrow
between me and him,
and disaster upon his people!

201
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,782
Let me go, then,
Jamuga.

202
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,346
He"s dearer to me
than life.

203
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,360
I cannot betray him,
even for his good.

204
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,194
Better to betray him for his good
than be thought a traitor...

205
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,293
<i>without profit.</i>

206
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,304
What are you saying,
woman?

207
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,637
That I will cry out
and call your beloved Temüjin!

208
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,676
<i>[Men Shouting]</i>

209
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,254

212
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,864
Out, Mongol! Out!

213
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,906
Out!
Out, Mongol!

214
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,511
Targutai!

<i>[Man Shouts]</i>

216
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,843
- Temüjin!

217
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,800

<i>[Dog Barks]</i>

219
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,788
Why is this carcass
lying here?
<i>It is an omen, my son.</i>

220
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,558
What woman"s talk
is this, my Mother?

221
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,032
Rid us of this carrion!
And what of your dead?

222
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:01,129
Those who died needlessly
for this cursed child
of Kumlek"s!

223
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,401
Jalair!
<i>Lord?</i>

224
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,881
Let two men guard this woman
in her tent.

225
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,680
If ill befalls her, they shall die
the slow death.

226
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,130
Chepei!

227
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,931
If the outpost guards still live,
bring them before me.

228
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,165
You would punish
your outposts...

229
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,676
after deserting us
and leaving Jamuga
to defend the camp?

230
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,675
Greetings, Temüjin.

231
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,347
Ah! To drink.

232
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,879
I could drain
ten brood mares dry.

233
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,824
Where is Jamuga?

234
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,122
Where is Jamuga?
I am here,
my brother.

235
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,533
What of the Merkits?
Routed
and well-bloodied.

236
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,333
But Subaya was wounded,
half his men slain.

237
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,307
Men we shall miss when
the Tartars descend upon us.

238
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,641
Leave the Tartars to me.
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>As with the Merkits?</i>

239
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,747
I dealt gently
with this oaf.

240
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,886
If others would speak,
let it be now!

241
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,988
Lord, the outposts.

242
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,865
Ah! So you had
the guard last night.

243
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:41,531
Yes, Lord.
The Merkits
fell upon us unawares.

244
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,166
You were fortunate
to have escaped death.

245
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,972
Truly fortunate, Lord.
We had drunk much.

246
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,280
Hang them.

247
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,807
Come.

248
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,752
Let all pay heed.

249
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,346
I have taken
the Tartar woman for a wife.

250
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,689
My son,
this you cannot do!

251
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,388
There"ll be an end of talk
on her account.

252
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,522
Bring meat and drink.

253
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,631
Jamuga!

254
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,872
Miserable fools!

255
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,941
They fear what will befall
when Kumlek strikes.

256
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,921
Who shall blame them?
For less cause, tribes
have slain their chiefs.

257
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,117
And you stand
with them?

258
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,922
Where is your faith,
my brother?

259
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,726
I was to bring
under my standard
all the tribes of the Gobi.

260
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,028
None would dare
stand against me.

261
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,901
Was not that once
your dream for me, Jamuga?
And still is.

262
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,996
But the time
is not yet ripe.

263
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:52,600
So I share the fear
that Kumlek"s daughter
will bring disaster.

264
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,044
Or lead me to achieve
what I have too long put off:

265
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,844
the destruction
of the Tartars.

266
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,785
How so, my brother?
With the forces
of Wang Khan.

267
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,721
Could it be that
this woman has touched
your wits as well?

268
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,248
Sharpened them,
more likely.

269
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:13,593
Were not my father and
Wang Khan blood brothers
as you and I?

270
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,793
I have a blood claim on him
l"ve never made,

271
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,565
even in my early trials.
Because the young Temüjin
had pride,

272
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:24,005
and knew that Wang Khan
would not lift a finger,
save in his own interest.

273
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,771
I go to him now
not as a beggar,

274
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,836
but as an ally with gifts...

275
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,712
and grave intelligence.

276
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:39,784
Kumlek, I learn, is preparing
to attack Wang"s city of Urga.

277
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,791
That lie
will not deceive him.

278
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:46,387
He"ll send spies
to test my report.
We"ll waylay them.

279
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,661
Their failure to return
will confirm my warning.

280
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,366
It could succeed...

281
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,168
if Wang does not
take counsel of his Shaman.

282
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,572
It is said he places
much reliance
in soothsayers.

283
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,577
What venture
is without hazard?

284
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,738
But not without retreat,
as this is.

285
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,272
If Wang discovers your deceit,
we"ll never leave the city.

286
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,376
This is a hazard
I run alone.

287
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,421
You"ll remain here,

288
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,254
making all ready for
moving camp on my return.

289
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,261
And the woman?

290
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:24,458
I leave her here, Jamuga,
in your trust.

291
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,332
You are troubled?

292
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:32,399
There"s something
I would tell.
Concerning her?

293
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:36,675
She used her wiles
on me last night
to gain her freedom.

294
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,740
What took you
to her tent?

295
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,685
That is a poor thought
between us, Temüjin.

296
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,087
Her slave came to me.

297
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,957
I divined the reason,
but went nonetheless
to learn her intent.

298
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,895
There is no limit
to her perfidy!

299
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,161
She is a woman,
Jamuga.

300
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,634
Much woman.

301
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,264
Should her perfidy be less
than that of other women?

302
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,934
I take her with me.

303
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,977
Jalair.
Yes, Lord?

304
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,518
Take three men and
make camp to the north.

305
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:25,926
If any man comes
riding hard from Urga,
question him on his purpose.

306
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,295
Torture him until
he speaks true.

307
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,164
If he goes to spy on
the Tartars, slay him.

308
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,635
And send word to me
at all speed.

309
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,070
As you command.

310
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,574
[Shouting]

311
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,034
Chepei.

312
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,703
Proceed to make camp
at the water hole.

313
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,840
You"ll find more ease
this night than last.

314
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,374
For me there is no ease
while you live, Mongol.

315
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,718
Your future promises
much discomfort.

316
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,110
Why is no tent
put up for me?

317
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,908
Because you"ll share mine.

318
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,849
I will sleep outside.
You, bring my fur robe.

319
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,179
Tend to your men.

320
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,556
You"ll have no further need
for furs. Come drink.

321
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,498
By night, my warmth,
and for adornment by day...

322
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,559
I shall heap precious stones
on you and rare ornaments.

323
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,801
I want no more
your stolen treasure than
your vile warmth, Mongol!

324
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,808
Those furs are mine!

325
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,277
The dowry for my marriage
with the man you slew!

326
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,779
[Groans]

327
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,012
I have taken you for wife, Bortai,
and I take your dowry.

328
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,953
Tomorrow in Urga,
I make gift of it to Wang Khan.

329
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,923
<i>[Chepei]</i>
<i>Lord, the woman!</i>

330
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,398
[All Laughing]

331
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,705
You"re beautiful
in your wrath.

332
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,511
Were Wang younger and
more nimble at dodging swords,

333
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,414
I might give you to him
and keep the furs.

334
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,117
For they, too, are beautiful.

335
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,758
I shall keep you, Bortai.

336
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:19,564
I shall keep you,
and responding to my passion,

337
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,629
your hatred
will kindle into love.

338
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,676
Before that day dawns,
Mongol,

339
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,509
the vultures will have
feasted on your heart!

340
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,000
Who goes?

341
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,068
Temüjin,

Your welcome touches me.

My blood brother
so treacherously poisoned
by the Tartar Kumlek.

349
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,482
What say you, O Khan?
Is a daughter
a fair exchange...

<i>for a father?</i>

351
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,885
Be it fair exchange
or no,

352
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,722
she"s a fair daughter
whoever"s she be.

353
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,821
What means, Temüjin?
This is Bortai,
daughter of Kumlek.

354
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,832
Daughter of
the Tartar?

355
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,425
I had thought to bring
her to you as a gift,

356
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,630
but I could not do you
this ill service,

357
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,300
for her nature is as ugly
as her body fair.
[Chuckles]

358

a gift of equal beauty...

endless pleasure
without endless trouble.

Forgive her, O Khan.
But lacking the talents
of these women,

383
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,319

I beg forgiveness
for her, O Khan.

390
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,158
With such gestures
does the Tartar woman
prove her love.

391
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,253
You see, she would"ve made
a poor gift.

393
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,393
Temüjin spoke earlier
of grave intelligence.

May we not
hear it now?
Yes! Yes!

395
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,634
Let"s hear it now.
Be gone! Be gone!

396
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:13,121
The Tartars and the Merkits
are joining forces
to attack us.

397
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,158
You are surprised,
as I was.

398
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,285
Yet we both have cause to know
the perfidy of Kumlek...

399
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,990
and the Merkit,
Targutai"s, ambition.

400
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,592
True.
For long l"ve nursed
revenge against Kumlek.

401
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,263
When I heard
his daughter was to be
the Merkit"s bride,

402
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,306
I struck,
waylaying them.

403
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,365
Targutai, I slew.

404
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,240
And with his dying oath,
he swore he"d be avenged:

405
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,339
that soon Kumlek
would rule the Gobi.
A vain boast in death.

406
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,944
And so I took it, until
the woman, in her wrath,
spat out like threats.

407
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:48,458
I forthwith sent spies
to Tartar territory,
and learned the news...

408
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,188
which brought me here
in haste.
What say you of this, Shaman?

409
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,890
lfTemüjin"s spies
reported truly-

410
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,059
Let the Khan send out
his own spies.

411
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,603
What think you
of that, Shaman?

412
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,435
So grave a question
demands a surer answer.

413
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,910
Let a sheep be slaughtered,
and the shoulder blade
brought hither.

414
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,003

Send swiftly and in secret
to your clans to mobilize,

432
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,945
and join with me in wiping out
the Tartars and the Merkits.

433
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,615
Thus my father
will be avenged,

The Khan grows idle
and full of years.

00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,829
Soon his petty chiefs
will fight among themselves
to take his place.

455
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:56,038
Then other tribes
will fall on us
like jackals.

that he was slain by Kumlek.

686
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,956
A Tartar lie, O Khan.
They tried in vain
to hold him captive.

687
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:27,126
My heart rejoices.
My Shaman!

688
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,636
My presence is desired,
O Khan?

689
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,106
Ah, my Shaman!
Always at hand.

690
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:37,544
Jamuga and Kasar bring word
ofTemüjin"s escape from Kumlek.

691
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:40,706
A miracle indeed!
What say you, Shaman?

692
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,114
My heart rejoices.

693
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:46,746
We come to name the day
and place where Temüjin
will await your forces.

694

have been cut out.

I have-

698
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:59,958
These envoys must be weary,
O Khan.

699
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,003
Oh, true.

700
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:06,336
Rest and refresh yourselves.
We"ll talk again
in the cool of the day.

701

But, Jamuga-
We accept your hospitality,
O Khan.

702

I like not this tale
ofTemüjin"s
miraculous escape.

703
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:26,826

of treachery here.

Treachery.
How say you, Shaman?

706
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:37,663
I have long thought
on this, O Khan.

707
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:42,073
Were the Mongol"s
secret purpose to trick us
into war with Kumlek,

708
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,612
he would not act otherwise.

709
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:49,116
To what end?
To fatten on our flesh,
O Khan.

710
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,880
Remember, they say
that when Temüjin was born,

711
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,218
a clot of blood was found
in his clenched fingers.

712
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,417
A certain augury
of greatness.

713
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,585
Beware, O Khan, beware...

714
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:03,097
lest the Mongol"s greatness
be achieved at your expense.

715
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:05,292
What say the spirits,
Shaman?

716
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,928
I was consulting them
when these emissaries arrived.

717
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:12,098
The signs are yet unclear,
and time presses.

718
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:16,838
With your leave, I will,
myself, look further
into Temüjin"s designs...

719
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,073

are committed.

Jamuga is much beloved
ofTemüjin.

01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:29,548
Hold him, O Khan,
the young bull also,

723
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:32,752

to my safe return.

724
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:45,997

did not await-

Poison?
Maybe.

730
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:19,906
There"s something afoot.
Then why stay?
Why not return?

731
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:22,307
If there is treachery,
we must penetrate it.

732
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,311
To do so, we must stay-

733
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,870

734

serve our brother naught

They would have stopped us
had we refused to stay.

Should they escape-
They shall not escape,

shall be your lot!

858
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,149
Make fire.

859
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:19,858
For three days now
your men have worked on him.

860
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:22,919
Is not your pleasure
satisfied, my Father?

861
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:25,830
He sickens me.
But he shall talk!

862
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,232
l"ll know the whereabouts
ofTemüjin-

863
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:31,203
Then let me talk with him
as I have asked you.

864
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:33,638
I know the nature
of this man.

865
01:38:33,707 --> 01:38:37,302
No torture will persuade him
like a woman"s gentleness.

866
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:42,509
My eagerness is no less
than your own to know
the whereabouts ofTemüjin.

867
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:47,814
Do with him what you will,
but make him talk!

868
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:50,015
Captain!

869
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:53,287
Let him be brought
to my tent.

870
01:39:06,807 --> 01:39:08,775
You have slept long.

871
01:39:08,842 --> 01:39:10,969
Drink.

872
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:16,674
You have suffered much.

873
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:20,709
But you will spare me
further suffering if-
If it is in my power.

874
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:24,189
Let us speak low.
Three of my father"s guard
watch this tent.

875
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:27,551
The hand is gentler,

876
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,755
the koumiss sweeter,

877
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:32,822
but no more potent than
the water to make me speak.

878
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,061
I ask nothing
but to know he lives.

879
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,899
I am well rested.
Call your guards.

880
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:40,702
You cannot trust me,
yet I aided his escape.

881
01:39:40,774 --> 01:39:43,868
And you will aid mine
if I tell you-
Nothing! Only that he lives.

882
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:47,436
Is he recovered?
Tell me, Mongol!
Guard!

883
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:49,948
Go! Go!
But you-

884
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:53,544
Fool.

885
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:57,522
For this betrayal, my father
would tear my heart out
with his own foul hand.

886
01:39:57,591 --> 01:40:00,560
I chance this gladly
just to know Temüjin lives.

887
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:02,686
To reach his arms,
l"d cast Kumlek to his fate...

888
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:05,926
and betray my people
into Mongol bondage.

889
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:10,765
Do you not understand,
Jamuga?

890
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:24,713
You said once you loved him
more than life.

891
01:40:24,785 --> 01:40:28,448
I am consumed
with want of him.

892
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:37,425
I can take you to him.

893
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:40,729
Where is he?
No, no. Do not tell me.

894
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:43,770
I will find a way.
It must be soon.

895
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,964
A danger threatens
he must know of.

896
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:50,704
I was hastening to warn him
when your men captured me.
It must be tonight.

897
01:40:50,778 --> 01:40:53,144
If he should die-
He will not die.

898
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:55,511
The peril is chiefly
to his enterprise.

899
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:59,074
His life is charmed,
for destiny has marked him.

900
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,785
Tell me ofTemüjin.

901
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:12,025
I know of him only that on
a sudden, my hatred for him
could not withstand my love.

902
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:18,362
He has a quality of spirit
that commands love,

903
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:21,875
and makes men
greater than themselves.

904
01:41:21,942 --> 01:41:25,673
Lacking this spirit,
I found fulfillment
in our brotherhood,

905
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:29,807
and strove to inspire him
to the greatness
he knew not yet was in him.

906
01:41:29,883 --> 01:41:33,216
That was the purpose
of my life.

907
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:34,982
"Was,"Jamuga?

908
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:39,424
He has found greater
inspiration, Bortai.

909
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:46,765
We must go to him.
I must find a way!

910
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:42,717
Bortai!

911
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:45,758
<i>Bortai!</i>
Temüjin!

912
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:53,427
Ah, my brother!
No, Temüjin, no!

913
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,627
Die, traitor, die!

914
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:43,674
Temüjin, beloved.

915
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:46,412
Ten men will guard you
with their lives.

916
01:43:47,487 --> 01:43:50,513
I go to avenge my father.

917
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:06,129
[Shouts Commands]

918
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:08,731
[Shouting]

919
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:00,875
[Shouts]

920
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:05,213
Mongol dog!

921
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:23,466
Hyah!

922
01:47:23,537 --> 01:47:26,335
Hyah!

923
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:10,479
He comes!

924
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:21,827
My heart is glad
that he lives to rejoice
in your triumph.

925
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:24,523
Open your heart to him,
Temüjin.

926
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:28,557
His love and loyalty for you
are no less than my own.

927
01:48:39,579 --> 01:48:43,811
Let there be brotherhood
between us as before, Jamuga.

928
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:46,819
Though your tongue
calls me brother,

929
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:49,048
your heart denies me,
Temüjin,

930
01:48:49,122 --> 01:48:51,352
for the worm of distrust
has entered into it.

931
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:54,689
The past shall be
forgotten, Jamuga.

932
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:57,491
The worm buries deep
but never dies.

933
01:48:57,564 --> 01:49:01,898
Temüjin would be uneasy by day,
and by night sleep fearfully.

934
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:04,732
Let"s hear no more of this.

935
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:06,738
I have made great conquests.

936
01:49:06,806 --> 01:49:09,138
I shall need
your wisdom henceforth.

937
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:12,337
You have no need of me
henceforth, my brother,

938
01:49:12,412 --> 01:49:14,380
for you have found
your destiny.

939
01:49:14,447 --> 01:49:16,915
Far greater conquests
will be yours, Temüjin,

940
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:20,817
and men will call you Genghis Khan,
the perfect warrior.

941
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,550
Jamuga of the silver tongue.

942
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:29,891
I have ill repaid your love,
my brother.

943
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:32,830
Ask now any favor of me,

944
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:36,562
and that I take my oath
to grant you.

945
01:49:38,872 --> 01:49:41,466
Grant that I may die swiftly.

946
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:43,873
No!
Jamuga!

947
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:46,845
That is the favor I ask,
my brother.

948
01:49:46,913 --> 01:49:49,973
I hold you to your oath.

949
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:54,783
As in the sacred ritual
of our ancestors, let my dying
be without bloodshed,

950
01:49:54,854 --> 01:49:56,822
so that in
the eternal heavens...

951
01:49:56,890 --> 01:50:00,189
my spirit may forever counsel
and protect the Great Khan.

952
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:04,826
So be it, my brother.

953
01:50:38,531 --> 01:50:41,227
<i>[Jamuga Narrating]</i>
<i>And the Great Khan</i>
<i>made such conquests...</i>

954
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,929
<i>as were undreamed of</i>
<i>by mortal men.</i>

955
01:50:44,004 --> 01:50:46,302
<i>Tribes of the Gobi flocked</i>
<i>to his standard,</i>

956
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:50,776
<i>and the farthest reaches</i>
<i>of the desert trembled</i>
<i>under the hooves ofhis hordes.</i>

957
01:50:50,844 --> 01:50:54,803
<i>At the feet ofhis Tartar woman,</i>
<i>he laid all the riches</i>
<i>of Cathay.</i>

958
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:58,339
<i>For 100 years,</i>
