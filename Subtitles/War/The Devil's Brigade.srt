1
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,444
Lt. Col. Frederick, good morning, sir.

2
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:38,437
We're a bit late, sir.
Could you hurry, please, sir?

3
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,685
The Allies were in trouble...

4
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:45,655
...and so was I, that summer of 1942,
when I arrived in England...

5
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:48,625
...on what I was sure was a fool's errand.

6
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:52,229
I'd come from Washington to explain
the US Army's strong opposition...

7
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,865
...to one of Lord Mountbatten's
favorite projects.

8
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:59,858
I'd written the army's critical report
in what I thought was plain English.

9
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,063
I was puzzled and annoyed at being
sent 4,000 miles to say it all over again...

10
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,778
...particularly to Lord Mountbatten himself.

11
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:11,248
You've never held a field command,
have you?

12
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:15,241
- No, sir.
- No combat experience?

13
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:18,555
No, sir.

14
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,190
By virtue of what special knowledge...

15
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,993
...do you so dogmatically
damn our plan of action?

16
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:25,161
You propose, in a period of four months...

17
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,731
...to recruit a unit,
half-Canadian, half-American...

18
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,268
...and drop them in Norway
in the middle of winter.

19
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:34,004
You have a new snow machine.

20
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,239
What kind of officers and men
will you recruit?

21
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,608
How will they be trained,
organized and equipped?

22
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,143
Your plan doesn't say.

23
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,779
The most important thing is,
once you get them there...

24
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,681
...how are you going to get them out?

25
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,783
There's been no provision made for that.

26
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:49,319
We're not unaware
of the problems, Colonel.

27
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,988
Nevertheless,
we're going ahead with the project.

28
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,991
If you've already made your decision,
what am I doing here?

29
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:58,984
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Let's go, Bob.

30
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,909
Gentlemen, I think we've found
our commanding officer.

31
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,844
If he'll take it.

32
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:18,837
He's more likely
to throw it right back in your face.

33
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:23,742
Care to bet?

34
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:37,289
So you left Washington for this, Colonel?

35
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:29,274
Don't move, Colonel.

36
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,728
Why in the hell did you have to shoot him?

37
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:42,721
You see, sir, we didn't feel like
waiting around till it starved to death.

38
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,100
Now, look, Captain.

39
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,203
That kind of smart-ass talk
don't go good with me at all.

40
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:51,196
You just be careful of that kind of talk.

41
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,714
Col. Frederick. Maj. Cliff Bricker, sir.

42
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:00,250
I started to collect snakes,
caught one yesterday.

43
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,720
I've got 'em in my footlocker in my room.

44
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,923
You're interested in herpetology.

45
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:08,258
You like snakes.

46
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:12,251
I hate 'em. Scared to death of them.
That's the reason I joined the paratroops.

47
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:15,832
See, I hated to fly.
Scared to death of jumping.

48
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:18,268
But after 50 jumps, I just loved it.

49
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:21,337
Danger, Colonel,
that's the best tonic there is.

50
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:23,440
That's the reason
I put in for Special Forces.

51
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,433
Major, when you address me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

52
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:36,708
This is my office, Major.

53
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:51,868
The name of this outfit is
the First Special Service Force.

54
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:55,071
- Where were you when I arrived?
- There was nothing to do here, sir.

55
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:58,274
We decided to go in town and look around.

56
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:01,778
A blind man could see
a thousand things to do.

57
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:05,771
Sir, you being in Washington,
you haven't been around like me.

58
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,486
You see, I've been in nine different camps.

59
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,454
I've got to tell you this, sir.

60
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:14,390
Never have I seen anything
so out-of-the-question hopeless...

61
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,792
...as this joint is.

62
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,761
There's absolutely nothing it doesn't need.

63
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:20,797
"Hopeless."

64
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,466
That's why we've got it, Major.

65
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,002
And that's why I've got you.

66
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,837
You've been in and out of camps...

67
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:31,830
...because you're the biggest hustler
and scrounger in the US Army.

68
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:35,478
In exactly 10 days,
our first recruits and volunteers arrive.

69
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:38,481
Whatever they and this camp need,
you're going to supply.

70
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,117
How you do it, I don't care.

71
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:45,110
Just start hustling. Cardwell?

72
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:07,499
Move it! Come on!

73
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:15,451
Line them up on the double! Move!

74
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,187
Come on! This is no Sunday school picnic!

75
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:22,180
Move it! Come on!

76
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,022
You think maybe somebody somewhere
has it in for our peerless leader here?

77
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:34,960
The summer I worked in a fish cannery,
we threw away better material than this.

78
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,248
Come on, you men, move!

79
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:49,241
Hate to break up the game, fellas,
but when my country calls...

80
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,821
Cut it out!

81
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:54,891
- Trouble, grease ball?
- I told you, don't call me that.

82
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:58,884
What would you like me to call you?
"Hotshot hustler," "Senor sharpshooter"...

83
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:01,097
...or just plain "punk"?

84
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,832
Watch it. Here he comes.

85
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:05,201
- You heard him. Line up!
- What's going on here?

86
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:08,004
Not a thing, buddy boy.
Not a blessed thing.

87
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:10,640
Pick up that hat and put it on, soldier!

88
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,843
And I warn you,
don't you give me any trouble.

89
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:17,836
Break it up!

90
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,070
Get that man!

91
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,941
Break it up!

92
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:48,934
We're going to try to make some kind of
a company formation out of this.

93
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,411
What are we doing up there?

94
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:24,247
I got stomach gas real bad.

95
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:28,240
I think I can cure that.

96
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,326
Ten hut!

97
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:41,319
Thanks for waiting, fellas. Sorry I'm late.

98
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:45,390
Don't you know how to fall in, soldier?
Fill up this spot.

99
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:49,961
Ten hut!

100
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,209
Detail all present and accounted for, sir.

101
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,579
I regret their behavior,
but that's the nature of the beast.

102
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,481
"Beast."

103
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:00,650
That's why they were transported
like cattle?

104
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,486
Sir, some them are so fouled up,
they must have emptied...

105
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:05,121
...every stockade in the country.

106
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:09,114
If I were you, I'd ship them right back.
What the hell's the army doing?

107
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,261
Just about what I expected.
Since you're not me...

108
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:14,430
...would you see that
they get to camp, please?

109
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,423
Yes, sir. Captain.

110
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,439
A-ten hut!

111
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:25,108
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,111
We're told that men evolved
from lower animals.

113
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:32,104
Apparently, you think it should be
the other way around. That's all.

114
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:35,485
Right face!

115
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:38,621
Forward! March!

116
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:42,614
Hut, two, three, four!

117
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,123
Your left.

118
00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:02,067
Soldier, get those dark glasses off.

119
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:09,574
- Where's your gear, fly boy?
- Seems I neglected to bring it with me.

120
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:14,590
Listen to the sugar plum.
He neglected to bring it with him.

121
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,583
You look a mite neglected yourself.
How come I didn't see you on the train?

122
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:22,131
I'm the inconspicuous type.

123
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:25,201
- Listen to him. Ain't he cute?
- Leave him alone, lard ass.

124
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:29,194
- You're asking for it, dago, you really are.
- Knock off the chatter, and get in step!

125
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:34,277
How about it?
Got a cure for that, Sergeant?

126
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:38,270
Yes, sir. Double time! March!

127
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:05,441
- That's the name of the game.
- What's your name, Luckhouse Louie?

128
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:09,078
Listen, we're not sharks in the game.
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

129
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,582
- Talkin' about luck, know how I got here?
- Who cares?

130
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:16,485
A sweet young thing
in San Jose says I raped her...

131
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,488
...takes all my money, every cent,
and blows the whistle on me.

132
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:23,392
They give me five years in Leavenworth,
or join this fearless fighting outfit.

133
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:26,095
- How's that for luck?
- Yeah, it's a great country.

134
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:29,599
Every slob can get clipped, whipped,
and double dipped at the same time.

135
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:33,592
Beat your gums, dago.
Beat 'em till they bleed.

136
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:37,773
I'm out $6.

137
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,877
Now, come on, deal the cards, damn it.

138
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:44,614
The only way out of here is over.

139
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:48,607
By balloon or P-38?

140
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:57,482
Did you ever hear of Bernheimer's
world-renowned circus?

141
00:14:57,727 --> 00:15:01,720
What about the Flying Greco Brothers?

142
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:12,230
Hold still, right?

143
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:24,720
- I'll be damned.
- Omar Greco.

144
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,656
- They call me Bronc.
- All right, Bronc.

145
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,492
My real name's Bronco Billy Guthrie.

146
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:33,485
- How many times you made it out?
- About five.

147
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:37,934
Bronc, I got a system, but I need a partner.

148
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:40,836
Let's hear about your system...

149
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:41,871
...partner.

150
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:44,173
All right. Come on.

151
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:48,166
If I'm gonna make it...

152
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:06,629
- Anybody question the requisitions?
- No, sir. It was a breeze.

153
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,622
We even got a wave-on from the guard.

154
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,304
Beautiful.

155
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:19,297
That's just fine. Great.
You guys get them around back fast.

156
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:23,601
Next trip, the toilet bowls.

157
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:39,895
All right, big mouth, that did it.

158
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,398
- Wait a minute. It was all my fault.
- Butt out!

159
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:46,391
Get him!

160
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:50,996
On your feet, dago. You got more comin'.

161
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:35,560
Change direction right!

162
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:39,931
Right wheel.

163
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:15,044
Mark time in front.

164
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,179
Canadian company...

165
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,248
...halt.

166
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:23,241
Left turn.

167
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:35,587
Maj. Crown, sir. Canadian army.
Reporting for duty.

168
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:39,624
Glad to have you with us, Crown.

169
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:48,766
Ready, company...

170
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:53,115
Capt. Cardwell, get these men
into formation on the double.

171
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:56,218
Sergeant, company formation
on the double.

172
00:20:56,218 --> 00:21:00,211
Company formation over here
and on the double, let's go!

173
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:06,017
Come on, move it. On the double.

174
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:18,073
God save the King.

175
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:22,066
God save us all.

176
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:29,674
Parade rest!

177
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:35,224
Welcome to the First Special Service Force.

178
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:39,217
There's only one really important thing
to know and remember about the force.

179
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:44,667
It's the easiest combat unit in the army...

180
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,536
...to get out of.

181
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:51,529
All you have to do is fail to measure up.

182
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:55,344
You'll be returned immediately
to your former unit...

183
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:57,813
...or predicament.

184
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:01,806
It's entirely up to you.

185
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,586
You Canadians, I'm told...

186
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:08,357
...are the handpicked best
of the best-trained army in the world.

187
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:12,350
We'll soon find out about that.

188
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:16,799
You Americans, for the most part...

189
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,769
...have an entirely different reputation.

190
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:24,762
I've been supplied with full details
on your military and moral delinquencies...

191
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:29,044
...prison records,
how many times you've been drunk...

192
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:32,181
...AWOL or both.

193
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:34,717
I know all about you...

194
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:38,710
...and I couldn't care less.

195
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:45,260
I want men that are tough...

196
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,253
...Iove to fight, fight to win,
and would rather die than quit.

197
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:53,969
Now, that's asking a lot...

198
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:57,962
...but no more than you're capable of
if you'll accept the challenge.

199
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:03,334
We'll soon find out about that, too.

200
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:07,905
Good luck to you all. Dismiss your men.

201
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:13,322
Company, ten hut!

202
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:17,315
- Fall out!
- Cpl. Peacock!

203
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:24,822
- Fall out the Canadians.
- Yes, sir!

204
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,233
Canadian company dismissed!

205
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:44,208
- Can you believe that?
- Lend me your hat. I may vomit.

206
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:50,748
- Sir...
- You, soldier.

207
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:53,862
- Where are you going?
- Sir, I've got to see the Colonel.

208
00:23:53,862 --> 00:23:56,265
If you ever hope to see
the outside world again...

209
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,933
...get back where you belong.

210
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:01,303
I don't belong anywhere.
I'm AWOL from Camp Gillam.

211
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:05,296
I escaped from the stockade.
I didn't arrive on the train, I walked.

212
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,444
- I want to transfer to this outfit.
- Get!

213
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:12,437
Soldier!

214
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:20,144
- In my office.
- Thank you, sir.

215
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:26,128
Phone his camp. Find out all about him.

216
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:30,121
I'll be in Communications. Let me know.

217
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:34,937
- Excuse me, haven't we met before?
- Get the hell outta here!

218
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:38,140
It's just that you remind me
of a sweet young thing I used to know.

219
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,410
I won't tell you again, mate.

220
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,403
Even sound like her.

221
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,487
Corporal, sir, you've got
a beautiful group of handpicked men here.

222
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:54,289
- You really do.
- Bugger off.

223
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:56,892
Where I come from,
the only thing we pick by hand...

224
00:24:56,892 --> 00:25:00,885
...is little yellow daffodils.

225
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:04,989
Where we come from,
we pick the rotten apples from the barrel...

226
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,736
...and feed them to the hogs.

227
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:11,729
Listen. One of them's a frog!
Go ahead. Say something, froggy!

228
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:14,176
Merde.

229
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,411
Just exactly what does that mean?

230
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:19,047
To most people, it's an insult.

231
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:23,040
But to you, I'd say it was a compliment.

232
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:28,212
- Peacock!
- Sir!

233
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:32,917
- Yes, sir.
- Peacock!

234
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:47,075
- At ease.
- Thank you, sir.

235
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:50,412
Long walk from Camp Gillam.

236
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:54,405
You must be more than ordinarily eager
to join the First Special Service Force.

237
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:55,984
Any job that's open, sir.

238
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:59,588
Or get out of any trouble
that you happen to be in.

239
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:03,492
You know, the one thing
I have excess of here is the troublemaker.

240
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:04,893
Yes, sir.

241
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:08,564
But if I heard your speech correctly, sir,
I think you've got the answer.

242
00:26:08,564 --> 00:26:12,501
Incite border warfare, so to speak...

243
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,938
...between the Americans and Canadians.

244
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:19,931
I only assume that was your intention, sir.

245
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:27,905
- What kind of trouble do you make?
- I play the piano, sir.

246
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:34,111
When I washed out as a flier,
I was assigned to Capt. Quill.

247
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:37,392
He runs the Officers' Club.

248
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:40,596
I was to clean up during the day
and play piano at night.

249
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:44,589
I didn't much fancy sitting out the war
playing I'll Never Smile Again...

250
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:49,571
...so I asked to be transferred
to Intelligence.

251
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:52,341
That should be a perfect spot for you.

252
00:26:52,341 --> 00:26:56,334
You're obviously intelligent,
perceptive, adroit.

253
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,914
Thank you, sir.

254
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:02,907
...and calculating.

255
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,513
How did Capt. Quill fancy your
playing around with his girlfriend?

256
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,096
The girl he thought was his girlfriend, sir.

257
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:17,566
I thought otherwise.
He won the argument.

258
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:20,068
- So he beat you up.
- Not all by himself...

259
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:22,004
Don't lie to me!

260
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:24,539
I have all the facts.

261
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,442
You're charged with striking an officer.

262
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:31,435
Capt. Quill asked you to stay away
from his girl, you attacked him...

263
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:35,283
...and his men had to use clubs
to subdue you.

264
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:38,020
I'm not crazy enough to strike an officer.

265
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,013
Sir, if you send me back, Quill could
keep me in prison for the rest of my life.

266
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:44,026
Yes, I know.

267
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:48,019
Don't calculate
that you can con your way in here.

268
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:51,700
- You read me correctly?
- Yes, sir.

269
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,693
I'm sorry to have bothered you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

270
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,032
Ransom, did I give you
permission to leave?

271
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:05,636
No, sir.

272
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:11,219
What's this?

273
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:15,212
When you beat somebody up,
that's a good way to play safe, isn't it?

274
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:20,317
Tie his hands behind his back.

275
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,623
Bricker!

276
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:28,670
- Yes, sir?
- Get this man a uniform.

277
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,107
You've got to be kidding!

278
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:34,576
The uniforms have been ordered, sir.
But nobody knows...

279
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:37,012
Get him something decent to wear.
He smells.

280
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:38,747
Yes, sir.

281
00:28:38,747 --> 00:28:42,740
That's all.

282
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:46,354
Sir.

283
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:49,958
I promise you, you won't be sorry.

284
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:53,951
If I am, I promise you,
you'll be a lot more sorry.

285
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:58,956
Yes, sir.

286
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,284
Those bastards!

287
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:19,688
- Something on your mind, Major?
- Yes, sir, there sure is.

288
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:23,681
We're making a big mistake going soft
on the kind of gorillas we got here.

289
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:29,086
- Did you say "gorillas"?
- Not the Canucks, the Americans.

290
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:33,691
"Canucks," Major,
is a term we consider disparaging.

291
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:38,707
Do you have a specific complaint, Major?

292
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:40,709
Yes, sir, I sure as hell do.

293
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:43,779
One of those stupid jerks out there
broke into my room...

294
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,281
...and stole my rattlesnake.

295
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:49,017
- Your what?
- Rattlesnake.

296
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:51,653
Maybe they don't allow them in Canada.

297
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:53,722
We destroy them,
we don't sleep with them.

298
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:57,715
Nobody likes
a promiscuous rattlesnake, Captain.

299
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:02,097
I can assure you, none of my men
would steal a rattlesnake...

300
00:30:02,097 --> 00:30:03,565
...or anything else.

301
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,734
My men are under strict orders.

302
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:09,727
Anyone discrediting the Canadian uniform
is subject to immediate court-martial.

303
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,032
Among other restrictions,
they're specifically forbidden to fight.

304
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:20,271
I suggest, sir, you consider a similar order.

305
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:25,053
- Do you have a complaint, Major?
- I don't mean to belittle the Americans.

306
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:28,456
What do you mean?

307
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:32,449
There have been numerous attempts
by your men to provoke my men.

308
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:36,587
And unless they're ordered to stop,
there could be serious trouble.

309
00:30:36,765 --> 00:30:40,758
- You really think so?
- I know so, sir.

310
00:30:40,836 --> 00:30:44,829
- We'll have to watch that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.

311
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,851
How did a friendly little fellow like you
get the name of "Ornery"?

312
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:59,844
Henri. It's French for Henry.

313
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,595
You got yourself
a nice little piece here, Ornery.

314
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,164
They say them French girls
know all kinds of tricks.

315
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,733
Give me that, you espece de salaud!

316
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,902
Ain't that a purty language?

317
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:17,895
Sure is marvelous
sharing quarters with you Canucks.

318
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:23,345
- Yeah, what's so marvelous about it?
- Now, let me think...

319
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:27,338
Bronc, this man is one of
the handpicked best, right, Corporal?

320
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:30,151
Thank God they're our friends.

321
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:32,921
Imagine what would happen
if we fought against them.

322
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:35,757
We could take Canada in two weeks,
if we wanted it.

323
00:31:35,757 --> 00:31:39,750
- Right, Manella?
- More like two days.

324
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:42,631
Is that a fact?

325
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:46,624
- Just you try it, mate!
- Back!

326
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:03,318
Good thing your wife wasn't under there.

327
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:06,321
Now, you listen to me,
you dirty-mouthed buggers!

328
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:09,824
I'm not one to pull rank,
but if there's any more of your filthy talk...

329
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:13,817
...or your foul, rotten tricks,
you'll pay for it.

330
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:16,731
Now, is that clear?

331
00:32:16,731 --> 00:32:20,468
Right. This man is right. Let's cut it out.

332
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:24,461
- Very sorry, Corporal.
- It won't happen again, Corporal.

333
00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:29,867
Very well, then.

334
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:41,412
Sweet dreams, Corporal.

335
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:48,986
Fall in.

336
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:53,268
We have very little time to determine...

337
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:56,671
...who is and who is not qualified...

338
00:32:56,671 --> 00:33:00,664
...for the difficult job assigned to this unit.

339
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:05,736
The training continues today
with a 30-mile hike.

340
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:09,751
Normally, you would carry
a full pack and a rifle.

341
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:13,021
I regret to say that our weapons
and much of our equipment...

342
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,023
...have not yet arrived.

343
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:18,026
We shall therefore
have to do without them.

344
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:21,329
However, we do have rucksacks...

345
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:23,765
...which are loaded
with 50 pounds of rocks.

346
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:26,434
Each man, each officer, and each unit...

347
00:33:26,434 --> 00:33:30,427
- He's got to be kidding.
- Don't you wish?

348
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:59,289
Corporal.

349
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:17,608
"Yankee doodle went to town,
riding on a pony

350
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:21,945
"Stuck a feather in his hat,
and he called it macaroni"

351
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:25,560
- Peacock?
- Yes, sir.

352
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,464
Your stripes are not a license
to behave like an ass.

353
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:32,634
No more derogatory behavior
or insulting remarks to the Yanks.

354
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:36,471
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

355
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:40,464
There will be no more
derogatory insults about the Yanks!

356
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:41,976
Is that clear?

357
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:45,969
Would ordinary insults be acceptable, sir?

358
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:54,578
Sir, what am I going to do about my men?
They're a bunch of eight balls.

359
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:58,726
Half of them, if they don't belong in jail,
should be put in a loony bin.

360
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:02,719
- How many of them keep pet rattlesnakes?
- Sir?

361
00:35:03,465 --> 00:35:07,458
How many of them have been
in and out of nine different camps?

362
00:35:07,602 --> 00:35:11,595
Would you like to try for 10, Major?
It's very easy.

363
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:22,506
All right, now, look alive.
I know this is in route-step, but shape up.

364
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:42,559
I see you circling up there,
and I know who you're following, too.

365
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:47,131
Fifteen miles back.

366
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:58,075
"The contents of this can
are not fit for human consumption."

367
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:12,890
- Maj. Crown?
- Sir?

368
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:18,173
The Canadians seem to be
in better condition than I expected.

369
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:20,742
That's very good of you to say so, sir.

370
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:24,735
"Very good of you to say so, sir.
Thank you, sir."

371
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:29,039
Bunch of gung-ho volunteers,
they give me the galloping trots.

372
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:22,770
I can't make it.

373
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,763
- I just can't make it.
- The hell you can't.

374
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:31,168
Anybody quits gets his head broke.

375
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,986
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing, sir.

376
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:40,655
Double hernia, slight heart attack,
otherwise he's fine.

377
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:42,857
Don't be smart, pretty boy.

378
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:46,850
- Everybody's fine, sir.
- Just don't drop out.

379
00:37:54,736 --> 00:37:58,729
Canadian company, double time!

380
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:02,110
American company, attention!

381
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,103
Double time! Hard!

382
00:38:08,016 --> 00:38:10,318
Come on, faster.

383
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:14,311
Keep up with them. Don't let them win.

384
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,768
Come on, get that bugger!

385
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:30,761
Run, boy, run!

386
00:38:32,106 --> 00:38:36,099
Go get him, Omar.

387
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:04,728
- Well done, lad. Good try.
- You all right?

388
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:21,055
You! Runt!

389
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:25,048
That was great work, soldier.

390
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:34,736
That was a silly-ass thing to do.

391
00:39:34,736 --> 00:39:38,729
I was just trying to return your favor, sir.

392
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:11,428
Now?

393
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:15,799
- You mean about getting out?
- Yeah.

394
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:20,248
Look, Bronc,
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

395
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:24,252
You said it yourself, remember,
that they always get you?

396
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:27,955
This time,
they could put me away for the duration.

397
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:31,948
It's just not worth it.

398
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:36,119
You've got your knife,
I'll give you half of this.

399
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:40,101
You won it. You keep it.

400
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:44,094
When you get it lighted,
I'll tell you what to do with it.

401
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:53,737
Bronc, listen, what if I help you get out?

402
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:56,951
What good'll that do?

403
00:40:56,951 --> 00:41:00,087
Bronc, will you take this?

404
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:02,824
I don't even smoke.

405
00:41:02,824 --> 00:41:06,817
It's very bad for the wind.

406
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:16,226
- Who is it?
- Maj. Crown, sir.

407
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,846
Come in.

408
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:28,839
Our chemists came up with this, sir.
It's the best thing I know of for sore feet.

409
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:33,254
Thank you. I don't need it.

410
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:35,389
Is that all?

411
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:39,060
You paid our men a compliment today, sir.
I'd like to reciprocate.

412
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,128
Your men performed
better than I expected.

413
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:43,498
- My men?
- The Yanks, sir.

414
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:46,901
Major, please understand,
I command the entire brigade...

415
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:49,203
...Canadians and Americans.

416
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:50,805
Yes, sir.

417
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:52,940
What I don't understand is, sir...

418
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,933
...why are you pitting them
against each other?

419
00:41:57,512 --> 00:42:01,516
I have less than four months left
to convert this misbegotten outfit...

420
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:04,185
...into the Army's finest combat unit.

421
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:08,178
I haven't time to explain or justify
every move I make.

422
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:10,091
Yes, sir.

423
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:14,084
But I might point out, sir,
that many of my men fought...

424
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:17,098
Many of the Canadian unit
fought at Dunkirk.

425
00:42:17,098 --> 00:42:18,366
So?

426
00:42:18,366 --> 00:42:21,536
So, it's just possible, sir,
you might want to learn a lesson...

427
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:25,529
...from their combat experience.

428
00:42:25,773 --> 00:42:28,209
Yes, I might...

429
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:31,879
...if you'd won at Dunkirk. You lost.

430
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:35,872
I'm training this outfit to win.
Good night, Major.

431
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:43,491
We lost, yes.

432
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:46,928
In a most bloody awful fashion, we lost.

433
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:50,064
But from that loss, I learned a lesson...

434
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:54,068
...the danger of assuming the role
of almighty God.

435
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:58,072
When the day of reckoning arrives,
as mine arrived at Dunkirk...

436
00:42:58,072 --> 00:43:02,065
...I can assure you, Colonel,
it can be a most sorry day, indeed.

437
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:19,382
That's it, boys.

438
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:47,154
Come on, move it. Let's go.

439
00:43:47,154 --> 00:43:50,224
Keep it moving.
Faster than that. That's it.

440
00:43:50,224 --> 00:43:54,217
That's it, Canadians. Keep it moving.
Don't get your feet wet, soldiers.

441
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:02,492
Get going, Americans.

442
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:07,330
Bronco, you got a sharp knife?

443
00:44:07,508 --> 00:44:11,501
Sharp enough.

444
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:25,993
What do you say, Peacock? You ready?
Nobody can see your stripes now.

445
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:29,163
- I know you're yellow.
- Cpl. Peacock.

446
00:44:29,163 --> 00:44:32,400
Sir?

447
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,037
You never looked better, Peacock.

448
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:38,673
- All right, next man on the line.
- All right, soldier.

449
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:41,642
Heard enough out of you, let's go. Move it.

450
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:45,635
Keep it going. Come on, move out.

451
00:44:50,217 --> 00:44:54,210
Capt. Cardwell tells me you spoke to him
about a man named O'Neill.

452
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,648
- Is he capable?
- He's capable enough to recommend, sir.

453
00:44:59,026 --> 00:45:03,019
However, if you question my judgment,
you could try him.

454
00:45:16,977 --> 00:45:20,970
I'm a new man here.
You'll not object if I join you?

455
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,119
You don't need all that space...

456
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,112
...even with that enormous
fat behind of yours.

457
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:37,454
God in heaven, you're not going to eat
that entire nauseating mess?

458
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:41,758
Small wonder you're
such a monstrous tub of lard.

459
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:48,498
Is it true that all you Yanks
are thieves and murderers?

460
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,446
There's one of you
that's worse than all the rest...

461
00:45:52,446 --> 00:45:55,416
...a villainous clod who never ceases...

462
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:58,219
...derogatory remarks about the Canadians.

463
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:02,212
Mind the elbow, lad.

464
00:46:02,523 --> 00:46:05,526
Would one of you be kind enough
to point out...

465
00:46:05,526 --> 00:46:09,519
...the contemptible swine
named Rocky Rockman?

466
00:46:11,398 --> 00:46:15,369
You have just two seconds
to make a public apology.

467
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,538
- What?
- Time's up.

468
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:19,073
You can't. We're under orders.

469
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:21,575
If you disgrace your uniform,
you'll be court-martialed.

470
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:24,044
Lad, it's his uniform I propose to disgrace.

471
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:28,037
Now, sit down.

472
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:33,543
The human body has
numerous vulnerable points:

473
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:38,214
The elbow, the ribs, the neck...

474
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:45,232
...including...

475
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:49,236
...the solar plexus and many other points.

476
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:53,229
It's true, you're a great, powerful beast.

477
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:57,411
But you'll note
how his own size and weight...

478
00:46:57,411 --> 00:47:01,404
...can be used against him.

479
00:47:06,787 --> 00:47:09,623
Name: Sgt. Patrick O'Neill.

480
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:13,260
Title: Hand-to-hand combat instructor.

481
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,362
Further instruction will
commence tomorrow...

482
00:47:15,362 --> 00:47:19,355
...07:00, on the parade ground.

483
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:35,405
Could you pass the salt, please?

484
00:47:35,816 --> 00:47:38,752
Thank you.

485
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:41,222
You're right, he's capable.

486
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:45,215
I hope, Major, that you won't punish him
for disobeying orders.

487
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:49,285
It was my impression
he was following your orders, sir.

488
00:47:51,498 --> 00:47:54,668
More coffee?

489
00:47:54,668 --> 00:47:58,661
I don't mind if I do. Thank you.

490
00:48:05,246 --> 00:48:07,348
And twist.

491
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:11,341
Try it.

492
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:19,616
All right, let's have a go at it.

493
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:26,533
In a situation like that,
you do this, you see?

494
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:30,526
The collarbones are very easy to break.
Now watch.

495
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:36,132
See? Try that.

496
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:41,371
Good.

497
00:48:51,558 --> 00:48:53,227
Your stance is more like this.

498
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:55,396
Look, Major, this is what I understand.

499
00:48:55,396 --> 00:48:59,389
- Whatever you understand.
- You really want me to stick you?

500
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:01,402
Whatever you want to do.

501
00:49:01,402 --> 00:49:05,395
- I wasn't quite ready.
- I already did it once.

502
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:09,565
- Try that again, Major.
- You gotta be...

503
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:25,248
As you can see,
Maj. Crown's an expert, sir.

504
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,997
Put your hands up like this.

505
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:32,232
Move your feet a little bit the other way.

506
00:49:32,232 --> 00:49:36,225
That's the way. All right, now.

507
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:56,412
- Good work, Greco, keep it up.
- Keep it up? Keep what up?

508
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:07,634
No!

509
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:10,304
You clumsy moose!

510
00:50:10,304 --> 00:50:14,008
Listen, you smart dago, you ran into me.

511
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:18,001
- Great, man. Just great.
- Show them the way, Canadians.

512
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:26,620
Well done, Crown.

513
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,624
I can't say the same for your men, Major.
What are you gonna do about it?

514
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:34,617
- The men are tired, sir. They need a rest.
- They can rest after the war is over.

515
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:37,598
Keep going until they're as good
as the Canadians.

516
00:50:37,598 --> 00:50:39,833
You want a weekend pass,
you'll work for it.

517
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:43,826
Let's go back up the hill one more time.
Now, let's see if we can do it right.

518
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:47,541
I've never seen anything so lousy
in my entire life.

519
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,844
Competition has its use, sir,
but doesn't it concern you?

520
00:50:50,844 --> 00:50:53,981
The men may hate each other
more than they do the enemy.

521
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:57,974
Major, your concern and mine is
to get them ready to meet the enemy.

522
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,713
Yes, sir.

523
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:14,001
Proud beauty,
why don't you sit down and have a drink...

524
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:16,036
...with some nice,
clean-cut American boys?

525
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:17,805
Where are they? I don't see them.

526
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:21,798
Fraternizing with the Canucks
comes under the heading of treason.

527
00:51:25,446 --> 00:51:27,548
All right.

528
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:30,484
- You can't fight nature.
- Just what's that supposed to mean?

529
00:51:30,484 --> 00:51:32,019
Miss Kleinschmidt's a lady.

530
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:36,012
Ladies associate with gentlemen,
not baboons.

531
00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:45,766
Take it easy, man-mountain.
You've got all night, my friend.

532
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:47,034
I'm in a hurry.

533
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,635
When this bottle is empty...

534
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:52,628
...I'm gonna break it over his head,
and then I'm gonna wipe him out.

535
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:56,777
How come a big man like you
thinks so small?

536
00:51:56,777 --> 00:51:58,946
Let's wipe out the whole
mother-Ioving bunch.

537
00:51:58,946 --> 00:52:00,047
Now you're talking.

538
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:02,950
- All right!
- Come on, let's do it!

539
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,886
I got dibs on Peacock.

540
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:09,879
That pretty Peacock is mine.

541
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:23,826
Wunderbar.

542
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:31,634
Somebody put a nickel in the jukebox,
and turn off that dame.

543
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:45,715
I love you.

544
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:17,925
Now you owe me a drink.

545
00:53:17,925 --> 00:53:20,460
Fellas. We better beat it.

546
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,453
- What do you speak? Eskimo?
- I said, "You owe me a drink."

547
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:28,468
You'll get that drink, Eskimo,
the minute hell freezes.

548
00:53:28,468 --> 00:53:30,103
Who do you think you are?

549
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:32,940
All right, Henri, let it pass.
Come on, move down the bar.

550
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,933
Give them some room now.

551
00:53:40,747 --> 00:53:44,740
Get over here.

552
00:53:55,963 --> 00:53:58,131
Look who we got here.

553
00:53:58,131 --> 00:54:01,468
- Millie, baby!
- Here, your petticoat's showing.

554
00:54:01,468 --> 00:54:04,204
Millie, who's your girlfriend?
Who does what to who?

555
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:07,474
- It's optional, mate.
- Shut your big, ugly face.

556
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:09,910
- Come on!
- Look, now you put me down!

557
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,980
- Don't be so particular.
- Can't you take a hint, mate?

558
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,215
I can eat a dozen chickens like you alive.

559
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,851
Look, we're here for a good time,
the same as you.

560
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:21,844
Let's not spoil it. What're you gonna
have to drink? Bartender!

561
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,525
We'll buy our own drinks.

562
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:28,795
You've got a hell of a nerve
barging in here, takin' our broads.

563
00:54:28,795 --> 00:54:31,064
- Any of you guys invite 'em?
- No!

564
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:33,667
- I can't stand Canucks.
- So you weren't invited.

565
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,103
So what do we do about that?

566
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:38,272
Give me another drink.

567
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:41,808
You clear out, or we throw you out.
Now what's it gonna be?

568
00:54:41,808 --> 00:54:43,243
Don't waste your time with him.

569
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:45,879
All right, we'll find another bar.
Finish your drinks.

570
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:49,049
We'll finish your drink.

571
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:53,042
- Let's go.
- You made a wise decision.

572
00:54:54,621 --> 00:54:56,523
Now, wait just a minute.

573
00:54:56,523 --> 00:54:59,726
Excuse me, but I'd like to clear up
a little misunderstanding.

574
00:54:59,726 --> 00:55:03,719
You see, the Canadians would be
happy to accommodate you...

575
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:08,024
...but they can't because they're under
orders, and they're not allowed to fight.

576
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:13,296
Am I getting through?

577
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,703
Where are you going to now, frog face?

578
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:36,897
You said nobody invited the Canucks.

579
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:40,890
But what burns me, big mouth,
is just who the hell invited you?

580
00:55:44,137 --> 00:55:48,130
Splendid, Rocky!

581
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,753
All right, Canadians,
don't disgrace your uniforms!

582
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:15,091
Join the Yanks!

583
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:25,901
One for Millie!

584
00:56:56,977 --> 00:57:00,970
Are you all right, Rocky?

585
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:05,741
Ten hut!

586
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:15,785
Break it up!

587
00:57:21,334 --> 00:57:25,327
Good! Good! That was good!

588
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,103
Break it up!

589
00:57:34,147 --> 00:57:38,140
All right! Break it up!

590
00:57:52,332 --> 00:57:56,325
- How are you?
- Doing fine.

591
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,583
What are you going to do about them?
I tried to warn you.

592
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,085
I'll take care of it.

593
00:59:19,085 --> 00:59:21,321
- Cardwell, Rose.
- Sir?

594
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:25,314
Line 'em up.

595
00:59:28,562 --> 00:59:31,431
Heads up in there! Come on!

596
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:33,600
Let's go! Come on!

597
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,593
Fall in!

598
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:44,945
The Lieutenant informs me...

599
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:47,948
...that 35 lumberjacks...

600
00:59:47,948 --> 00:59:51,484
...and 17 MPs were injured...

601
00:59:51,484 --> 00:59:53,954
...and six hospitalized...

602
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:57,947
...and that property damage
was in excess of $3,000.

603
00:59:59,025 --> 01:00:02,462
Now, every man, regardless of uniform...

604
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:06,455
...is equally guilty,
and will be equally punished.

605
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:11,638
Until the damage is settled...

606
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:15,631
...every man will have deducted
$1 a month from his pay.

607
01:00:17,077 --> 01:00:21,070
From this point on, the entire brigade
is restricted to barracks...

608
01:00:22,482 --> 01:00:26,475
...for a period of eight hours.

609
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,391
Any additional singing...

610
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:35,384
...drinking, or celebrating...

611
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:40,055
...will be conducted with proper restraint.

612
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:44,226
That's all.

613
01:00:44,504 --> 01:00:48,497
Dismissed!

614
01:00:51,077 --> 01:00:54,414
"For he's a jolly good fellow

615
01:00:54,414 --> 01:00:58,407
"For he's a jolly good fellow

616
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:03,056
"Which nobody can deny

617
01:01:03,056 --> 01:01:06,359
"Which nobody can deny

618
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:09,562
"Which nobody can deny

619
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:13,555
"For he's a jolly good..."

620
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:28,415
Come in.

621
01:01:28,415 --> 01:01:30,383
Sir.

622
01:01:30,383 --> 01:01:34,376
May I presume to offer you a drink?

623
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:41,283
Sit down.

624
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:50,170
Come on, lads.

625
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,473
I'll take a snap of you.
Send a copy of this to the Krauts.

626
01:01:53,473 --> 01:01:55,008
They'll bloody surrender.

627
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:58,044
Come on, big smiles. There you are.

628
01:01:58,044 --> 01:01:59,412
Hugh, just one more.

629
01:01:59,412 --> 01:02:02,182
My father always wanted me
to graduate from something.

630
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:06,175
Right you are. That's beautiful.

631
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:15,951
Gorgeous, Rocky. Just gorgeous.

632
01:02:17,397 --> 01:02:21,390
You're still a big baboon.

633
01:02:36,716 --> 01:02:40,709
First Special Service Force pass in review.

634
01:02:40,754 --> 01:02:44,747
Number 1 company, right turn!

635
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,697
- Number 2 company, right face!
- Number 3 company, fall in.

636
01:02:50,697 --> 01:02:54,334
First platoon, forward march.

637
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:57,403
Second platoon, forward...

638
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:58,571
...march!

639
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:02,564
First platoon, forward march.

640
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:19,681
Eyes right!

641
01:03:39,445 --> 01:03:43,438
Maj. Bricker, Maj. Crown, take over.

642
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:10,677
But I can't believe it, sir.

643
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:12,812
I just don't believe it.

644
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,849
Bob, it's no satisfaction to me,
but I knew it.

645
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:18,551
I smelled it. I warned you.

646
01:04:18,551 --> 01:04:20,420
I'm very sorry.

647
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,413
That's comforting. Good-bye.

648
01:04:27,861 --> 01:04:31,854
Come in.

649
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:38,538
- Project's been canceled.
- Canceled?

650
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:41,140
God, why?

651
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,844
The commando raid on Norway
is an entirely English project.

652
01:04:44,844 --> 01:04:48,837
We're out of it.
Well, we'll be getting orders soon.

653
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:52,352
What kind of orders, sir?

654
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:56,345
Disbanding the brigade.
The men will be assigned to other units.

655
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:59,692
Son of a bitch.

656
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:01,794
Don't tell me I'm nuts.

657
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:05,787
I tell you, I just heard.
They're bustin' up the force.

658
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:10,737
What did we break our asses for? Why?

659
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:13,539
"Ours is not to reason why."

660
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:17,310
Damn the reasons.
I want more than reasons.

661
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:21,303
I'm going to Washington.
Tell the men it's just a routine trip.

662
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:24,918
Give everybody a 10-day Christmas leave.

663
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:28,554
Is there a chance, sir?
Have you got friends up there?

664
01:05:28,554 --> 01:05:30,556
No.

665
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:34,549
But at this point, I don't care
about making any more enemies.

666
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:36,529
We don't need your unit.

667
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:40,366
What we desperately need are
replacements for other units.

668
01:05:40,366 --> 01:05:44,359
Anyhow, orders have been issued.
It's out of my hands. Gentlemen.

669
01:05:45,305 --> 01:05:47,407
Sir, may I have permission
to see Gen. Cullen?

670
01:05:47,407 --> 01:05:51,400
Why, George, he doesn't mean to imply
he's going over your head.

671
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:55,315
He's not implying anything. He's saying it.

672
01:05:55,315 --> 01:05:59,308
- You've got time to waste, go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

673
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:02,655
Thank you, George.

674
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:04,958
Look, Bob, I understand, I sympathize.

675
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:08,328
But you keep on this way,
you're gonna retire a Lieutenant Colonel.

676
01:06:08,328 --> 01:06:10,196
General...

677
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:13,399
...I have men who care more about
the one stripe they've earned...

678
01:06:13,399 --> 01:06:15,935
...than I'd care if you buried me in brass.

679
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:19,928
Why do I help you?
Why do I even bother talking to you?

680
01:06:20,907 --> 01:06:24,900
- It's your funeral, Bob. Enjoy it.
- Walter?

681
01:06:25,011 --> 01:06:28,481
I want to thank you for your help...

682
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:32,474
...and your friendship.

683
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:38,680
Col. Frederick to see Gen. Cullen.

684
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:42,428
I don't believe
you have an appointment, Colonel.

685
01:06:42,428 --> 01:06:45,264
May I ask the nature of your business?

686
01:06:45,264 --> 01:06:48,534
Would you tell the General
that it's very urgent?

687
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:50,636
Gen. Cullen's in a staff meeting.

688
01:06:50,636 --> 01:06:53,806
I don't expect him back
before 7:00 at the earliest.

689
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:56,642
Where can we reach you?

690
01:06:56,642 --> 01:07:00,635
Right here.

691
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:06,441
You're a lucky dago.

692
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,824
- Joy to the world.
- Lf it ain't old handsome Ransom.

693
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:13,659
What brings you back so soon?

694
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:17,652
Sir, I found the old homestead
intolerably oppressive.

695
01:07:18,297 --> 01:07:20,800
Not the heat, the humility.

696
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,793
- Pull up a bayonet, and you sit down.
- Home is where the heart is...

697
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:28,941
...also the liver, spleen,
and the lower intestine.

698
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:31,577
- What you need is a drink.
- True.

699
01:07:31,577 --> 01:07:32,912
Come on, ante up.

700
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:35,915
- Who dealt this one?
- Come on, get your money in.

701
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:39,419
This horse should have
his kidneys checked.

702
01:07:39,419 --> 01:07:42,789
And why aren't you all partaking of
the blessings of home and family?

703
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:46,782
- What's to go home to?
- I went home. Stupid sister's.

704
01:07:47,293 --> 01:07:48,961
That draft dodger she married...

705
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:50,963
...you know what he called me?

706
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:53,066
"Sucker." I didn't say nothin'.

707
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:57,059
I just broke his jaw and walked out.
Deal the cards, Hopalong.

708
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:00,807
- Any word from Washington?
- Nothing. Not even a peep.

709
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:02,442
High muckety-muck Generals.

710
01:08:02,442 --> 01:08:05,044
Jesus Christ was satisfied
with just one star.

711
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:07,046
Some of those brass hats gotta have four.

712
01:08:07,046 --> 01:08:10,716
You know how they get 'em?
By screwin' things up.

713
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:13,052
All right, cowboy,
we gonna play cards or not?

714
01:08:13,052 --> 01:08:14,387
All right, I'm in.

715
01:08:14,387 --> 01:08:18,380
- Ante up.
- Come in, boys.

716
01:08:22,028 --> 01:08:24,397
Thank you.

717
01:08:24,397 --> 01:08:28,390
My sister's children.
Their father's off somewhere in the Pacific.

718
01:08:28,434 --> 01:08:30,536
Hasn't been home in over a year.

719
01:08:30,536 --> 01:08:34,529
I guess the least I can do is
make their packages look nice.

720
01:08:34,707 --> 01:08:38,411
Do you have a family, Colonel?

721
01:08:38,411 --> 01:08:39,712
Yes.

722
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:43,705
Not much of a Christmas
for you either, is it?

723
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:48,955
Gen. Cullen's office. Gen. Cullen.

724
01:08:48,955 --> 01:08:50,890
Sir, there's a Col. Frederick here.

725
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:54,883
Been waiting since 3:30.
Says it's very urgent.

726
01:09:00,066 --> 01:09:02,602
I see.

727
01:09:02,602 --> 01:09:06,038
And a very merry Christmas
to you, General.

728
01:09:06,038 --> 01:09:08,674
Gen. Cullen won't be back to the office.

729
01:09:08,674 --> 01:09:12,667
He says he's fully aware of your situation,
but there's absolutely nothing he can do.

730
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:17,472
I'm sorry.

731
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:33,132
Colonel.

732
01:09:33,132 --> 01:09:37,125
From Gen. Walter Naylor.
He just phoned. Can you read it?

733
01:09:41,774 --> 01:09:45,767
Merry Christmas.

734
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:52,785
Gen. Mark Clark,
Gen. Hunter, Col. Frederick.

735
01:09:52,785 --> 01:09:54,453
- Colonel.
- General.

736
01:09:54,453 --> 01:09:58,446
Thank you.

737
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:02,584
- Gen. Naylor informs me you need men.
- That's right.

738
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:08,668
In Italy,
we're facing a solid wall of mountain...

739
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:11,737
...defended by the best troops
in the German army.

740
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:14,640
As you've doubtless heard,
we're getting nowhere.

741
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,243
Have your boys had any mountain training?

742
01:10:17,243 --> 01:10:20,713
I promise you, sir,
whatever the job is, we can handle it.

743
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:23,983
That's quite a promise coming from a man
with no combat experience...

744
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:26,452
...commanding an outfit
that nobody wants.

745
01:10:26,452 --> 01:10:29,722
Gen. Hunter's been making some inquiries.
He's a little dubious.

746
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:31,691
One misfit can foul up a whole company...

747
01:10:31,691 --> 01:10:34,227
...and one fouled-up company
can ruin a whole attack.

748
01:10:34,227 --> 01:10:38,220
A lot of your men are chronic misfits,
that's the word I get.

749
01:10:38,264 --> 01:10:41,267
I don't know where the General
got his information, sir...

750
01:10:41,267 --> 01:10:42,702
...but I can guess.

751
01:10:42,702 --> 01:10:45,671
Probably from the people
who sent us the misfits.

752
01:10:45,671 --> 01:10:49,664
As of now, man for man,
they're the best combat unit in the world.

753
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:53,835
And that's a fact, sir, not a promise.
If you doubt it, let us prove it.

754
01:10:55,848 --> 01:10:59,752
Unfortunately, there's no luxury in war.

755
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:03,745
Gen. Hunter won't agree with me,
but this is no time to be conservative.

756
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,026
I do need your men, Colonel.

757
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:11,019
- When can they be ready?
- Right now, sir.

758
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:17,826
Attention!

759
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:20,306
As you were.

760
01:11:20,306 --> 01:11:24,299
Sorry to interrupt your religious services,
but good news requires a drink...

761
01:11:25,278 --> 01:11:27,713
...and I detest drinking alone.

762
01:11:27,713 --> 01:11:29,715
Yes!

763
01:11:29,715 --> 01:11:32,585
You've heard from the Colonel.
We're still alive!

764
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:34,754
Very much alive.

765
01:11:34,754 --> 01:11:36,756
I knew it.

766
01:11:36,756 --> 01:11:40,126
A merry Christmas to him, to us...

767
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:43,195
...and to the brigade.

768
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:47,188
We're alive, I knew it!

769
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:01,303
Follow that stream up ahead.

770
01:12:33,646 --> 01:12:36,248
Lower! Get lower.

771
01:12:36,248 --> 01:12:40,241
Sir, we're gonna get our ass shot off.

772
01:12:51,764 --> 01:12:55,757
- All right, let's head back.
- Yes, sir.

773
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:11,272
Colonel, my first impression of you
was a whole lot less than favorable.

774
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:15,955
This daredevil flight of yours...
I don't want any officer around me...

775
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:18,391
...who takes unnecessary
or unauthorized risks.

776
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:22,261
- Is that understood?
- Not entirely, sir.

777
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:26,254
- Depends on how you define unnecessary.
- Never mind the definitions.

778
01:13:26,632 --> 01:13:29,969
Your outfit is being sent
on an ordinary, routine patrol.

779
01:13:29,969 --> 01:13:32,905
You were given maps
and reconnaissance photos, right?

780
01:13:32,905 --> 01:13:36,898
All of which fail to indicate
that the entire route is under enemy fire.

781
01:13:38,077 --> 01:13:42,070
Sure, enemy fire.
Would you like to be relieved?

782
01:13:42,248 --> 01:13:46,241
No, sir. But I think I've found a safer route.

783
01:13:49,655 --> 01:13:53,125
Show me.

784
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:57,118
Sir, if we could enter the stream
two miles above or below the bridge...

785
01:13:57,329 --> 01:14:01,233
...around Hill 418, and then
enter Santa Elia from the south...

786
01:14:01,233 --> 01:14:04,303
Take your men two miles
through ice-cold water...

787
01:14:04,303 --> 01:14:06,872
...arriving, if they arrive, behind the town...

788
01:14:06,872 --> 01:14:09,341
...in a position to be cut off,
captured, wiped out.

789
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:12,778
- Very good.
- Not if they perform as expected, sir.

790
01:14:12,778 --> 01:14:16,682
What do you think Santa Elia is,
a Boy Scout camp?

791
01:14:16,682 --> 01:14:20,019
It's a key German supply line to
the mountains and heavily fortified.

792
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:23,456
- Here it is.
- Yes, sir, you're right.

793
01:14:23,456 --> 01:14:25,691
Now, listen to me.

794
01:14:25,691 --> 01:14:28,027
You've got to take Santa Elia
sooner or later...

795
01:14:28,027 --> 01:14:30,429
...but I've gotta know
what we're up against.

796
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:34,422
Now, frankly, I don't know
what to expect from your men.

797
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:39,238
I'm hoping they'll scout the area
and bring back a few prisoners.

798
01:14:39,238 --> 01:14:41,440
That's what I want from you. Is that clear?

799
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,433
Do I gather, sir, you're trying to test us?

800
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:49,114
You can stop worrying right now, sir.
Let me tell you...

801
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:53,107
No, sir, we understand.
You're quite clear, sir.

802
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:56,989
I'm glad of it.

803
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:59,325
When your outfit comes back
from the patrol...

804
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:01,727
...you report to me immediately.

805
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:05,720
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

806
01:15:05,965 --> 01:15:09,958
Yeah, all right.

807
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,409
I must say, sir,
you accepted his insults graciously.

808
01:15:17,409 --> 01:15:21,247
You get a great idea, he doesn't like it.
So you just forget about it, right?

809
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:23,482
Do it by the book.

810
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:26,952
That's what he thinks. What do you think?

811
01:15:26,952 --> 01:15:30,945
He wants prisoners, we give him prisoners.

812
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:59,952
Damn, why does this guy
love water so much?

813
01:15:59,952 --> 01:16:02,054
Why? He's nuts.

814
01:16:02,054 --> 01:16:05,357
Who ever heard of a Colonel on a patrol?

815
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:08,027
A daddy wants to take care
of his little kiddies.

816
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:12,020
- Right, pretty boy?
- Right.

817
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:19,305
- There goes my chance to be a daddy.
- Don't worry about it, frog.

818
01:16:19,305 --> 01:16:23,108
Keep quiet.
Pass it on to the other morons.

819
01:16:23,108 --> 01:16:27,101
Quiet up there!

820
01:17:36,048 --> 01:17:40,041
It's only a mailman.

821
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:22,196
Peacock. You, McDonald, Bronc...

822
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:49,428
You know what to do. Kill if you have to.

823
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:53,421
But the most important thing is prisoners.
We've got to get 'em.

824
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:59,293
In an hour, the whole town'll be awake,
so we have to move fast.

825
01:22:59,972 --> 01:23:02,341
In Deutsch.

826
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:06,334
"Silence, or you're dead."

827
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:14,486
No mistakes.

828
01:23:14,486 --> 01:23:18,479
One mistake, we're all dead.

829
01:23:18,824 --> 01:23:20,625
You stay here.

830
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:24,618
Drag these bodies. Hide 'em someplace.
But you stay here. Let's go.

831
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:31,957
- Move.
- Keep it quiet. Don't let up.

832
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:34,993
- Come on.
- Come on. Keep going.

833
01:25:34,993 --> 01:25:38,986
Keep it quiet. Get a move on.

834
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:45,997
Move!

835
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:49,990
- Get a move on.
- Let's go.

836
01:26:56,841 --> 01:27:00,834
Move!

837
01:28:11,816 --> 01:28:15,809
Once more! How many men?
What is your objective?

838
01:28:16,688 --> 01:28:19,090
Rockwell W. Rockman, Corporal.

839
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:22,961
Serial number: 15359...

840
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:26,954
Once more! How many men?
What is your objective?

841
01:28:27,299 --> 01:28:31,036
Rockwell W. Rockman, Corporal.
Serial number...

842
01:28:31,036 --> 01:28:32,704
You bastard.

843
01:28:32,704 --> 01:28:36,574
Another one? Maybe he can be persuaded.

844
01:28:36,574 --> 01:28:40,245
At least he is looking
more intelligent than this one.

845
01:28:40,245 --> 01:28:43,181
Rocky, lad.

846
01:28:43,181 --> 01:28:47,174
What have they done to you?

847
01:28:57,996 --> 01:29:01,989
Peacock!

848
01:29:02,233 --> 01:29:06,226
Gunter!

849
01:30:14,305 --> 01:30:16,274
We took it, sir.

850
01:30:16,274 --> 01:30:20,267
- Now what the hell do we do with it?
- We keep it.

851
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:31,371
Does this answer your question?

852
01:31:50,301 --> 01:31:54,294
At ease.

853
01:31:57,075 --> 01:32:00,245
Absolutely everything you did,
from beginning to end...

854
01:32:00,245 --> 01:32:02,747
...was directly contrary to my orders.

855
01:32:02,747 --> 01:32:06,084
Sir, I recall a lecture, some advice...

856
01:32:06,084 --> 01:32:09,254
...some criticism of our ability,
but I don't recall any orders.

857
01:32:09,254 --> 01:32:12,156
How's your recollection
concerning unnecessary risks?

858
01:32:12,156 --> 01:32:13,758
Why did you lead that patrol?

859
01:32:13,758 --> 01:32:17,061
If you will recall, sir,
I hadn't had any combat experience.

860
01:32:17,061 --> 01:32:18,530
I wanted to see what it was like.

861
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:22,523
You've never been killed, either.
Do you want to find out what that's like?

862
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:27,872
- How many men did you lose?
- None, sir. Six wounded, not bad.

863
01:32:27,872 --> 01:32:31,865
There's no doubt, sir, that we were lucky
that it worked out as well as it did.

864
01:32:32,343 --> 01:32:36,336
Yeah. As well as can be expected, sir.

865
01:32:39,884 --> 01:32:43,877
Come over here.

866
01:32:46,858 --> 01:32:49,060
What'll you have?

867
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:53,053
Sir, I'd like about a dozen cases
for the men if you can spare it.

868
01:32:53,331 --> 01:32:57,324
- You're an insolent bastard, aren't you?
- You're right, sir.

869
01:32:57,502 --> 01:33:01,495
Two hundred German prisoners
will tell you that.

870
01:33:01,873 --> 01:33:05,866
- You want a drink or not?
- No thank you, sir.

871
01:33:08,146 --> 01:33:12,139
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

872
01:33:16,154 --> 01:33:18,222
Sir, you must come now.
It's very important.

873
01:33:18,222 --> 01:33:22,215
- You won't believe what we just found out.
- It's an emergency, sir.

874
01:33:22,961 --> 01:33:26,954
Emergency?

875
01:33:31,936 --> 01:33:33,905
What kind of an emergency? Make sense.

876
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:37,108
The clerk was going over
personnel records. There's no denying it.

877
01:33:37,108 --> 01:33:38,843
No doubt about it. We got proof.

878
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:40,578
Proof of what?
What are you talking about?

879
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:43,348
It's your birthday. Happy birthday, sir.

880
01:33:43,348 --> 01:33:47,341
Happy birthday, sir!

881
01:34:08,172 --> 01:34:09,374
Give me a drink!

882
01:34:09,374 --> 01:34:11,542
"For he's a jolly good fellow

883
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:14,278
"For he's a jolly good fellow

884
01:34:14,278 --> 01:34:18,271
"For he's a jolly good fellow

885
01:34:18,316 --> 01:34:21,552
"Which nobody can deny

886
01:34:21,552 --> 01:34:24,188
"Which nobody can deny"

887
01:34:24,188 --> 01:34:28,181
Okay, knock it off! All right. Pipe down.

888
01:34:28,459 --> 01:34:32,452
Listen. If you guys can hold off
gettin' drunk for a couple of seconds...

889
01:34:32,697 --> 01:34:36,134
...you're gonna hear
a few well-chosen pearls of wisdom...

890
01:34:36,134 --> 01:34:39,404
...from that distinguished Irishman
and eminent scholar...

891
01:34:39,404 --> 01:34:43,397
...Maj. Crown.

892
01:34:48,246 --> 01:34:51,582
Today I had the pleasure...

893
01:34:51,582 --> 01:34:55,186
...of interrogating some German prisoners.

894
01:34:55,186 --> 01:34:57,622
They said some flatterin' things about us...

895
01:34:57,622 --> 01:35:01,615
Gangsters, murderers, savages...

896
01:35:02,593 --> 01:35:06,064
But the most memorable compliment...

897
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:10,057
...came from their commanding officer.

898
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:14,327
And he referred to us as...

899
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:22,202
...members of the Devil's brigade.

900
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,983
Long life...

901
01:35:25,983 --> 01:35:29,976
...to the devil!

902
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:39,330
- Give me a drink.
- You organize this?

903
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:41,766
No, sir. It was a popular uprising.

904
01:35:41,766 --> 01:35:45,103
Cast your bread on the waters,
it comes back a testimonial dinner.

905
01:35:45,103 --> 01:35:49,096
But where it comes from,
I wouldn't be askin'.

906
01:36:01,018 --> 01:36:04,522
It's done my heart a world of good
the way you guys have shaped up.

907
01:36:04,522 --> 01:36:08,515
I couldn't have done a better job myself.

908
01:36:09,127 --> 01:36:12,296
Attention!

909
01:36:12,296 --> 01:36:15,032
- General.
- General.

910
01:36:15,032 --> 01:36:19,025
- Frederick.
- What is going on here?

911
01:36:19,737 --> 01:36:21,472
Little celebration, sir.

912
01:36:21,472 --> 01:36:24,308
- May I offer you a drink?
- Certainly.

913
01:36:24,308 --> 01:36:27,645
No, later. Is there someplace
we can talk, Colonel?

914
01:36:27,645 --> 01:36:31,638
This way, sir.

915
01:36:33,584 --> 01:36:35,820
Mount la Difensa.

916
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:39,357
It's on the road to Rome,
flanked all around by mountains.

917
01:36:39,357 --> 01:36:42,460
Mount la Difensa's the key point
to this entire sector.

918
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:45,029
We've been trying for weeks
to take it from them.

919
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:48,366
We've had total failure.
And we've had heavy casualties.

920
01:36:48,366 --> 01:36:50,268
But we've got to get it.

921
01:36:50,268 --> 01:36:53,604
For good behavior in prison,
you're rewarded with time off.

922
01:36:53,604 --> 01:36:57,597
In the army, double time,
and a swift kick in the rear.

923
01:36:58,476 --> 01:37:01,345
Your reward, Colonel, is la Difensa.

924
01:37:01,345 --> 01:37:05,338
Study the maps, send out scouting patrols,
give me a plan of attack.

925
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:08,853
General, this fellow doesn't
send out patrols.

926
01:37:08,853 --> 01:37:12,846
- He leads 'em.
- Full Colonels are not expendable.

927
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:17,484
Sir, how low in rank does a man
have to be before he's expendable?

928
01:37:19,163 --> 01:37:23,156
Good night, Colonel.
Enjoy your celebration.

929
01:37:23,734 --> 01:37:27,727
Night, Colonel.

930
01:37:34,846 --> 01:37:38,839
"Around her leg she wore a purple garter

931
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:43,343
"She wore it in the springtime
and in the month of May

932
01:37:43,621 --> 01:37:47,614
"And when you asked her
why the hell she wore it

933
01:37:47,892 --> 01:37:51,896
"She wore it for her parents
who were far, far, away

934
01:37:51,896 --> 01:37:53,898
"Far away, far away

935
01:37:53,898 --> 01:37:56,534
"Far away, far away

936
01:37:56,534 --> 01:38:00,527
"She wore it for her parents,
who were far, far away..."

937
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,578
Our reconnaissance has shown...

938
01:38:07,578 --> 01:38:11,571
...that the German guns
are facing west and south.

939
01:38:12,183 --> 01:38:16,120
That's why I propose
that we attack from the east.

940
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:20,113
What I need from you, sir,
is an artillery barrage, all you've got...

941
01:38:20,591 --> 01:38:22,927
...on the forward slopes.

942
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:26,197
That'll give 'em the idea
that we're attacking from here.

943
01:38:26,197 --> 01:38:29,800
In the meantime, at 06:00, I can be here...

944
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:32,336
...at 09:00, here.

945
01:38:32,336 --> 01:38:35,806
By reaching this point, we'll be
above them, holding the high ground.

946
01:38:35,806 --> 01:38:38,509
For us, it'll be a downhill fight all the way.

947
01:38:38,509 --> 01:38:42,502
If we can drive them beyond
these big rocks, they'll have no cover.

948
01:38:42,647 --> 01:38:44,582
They'll have to surrender or die.

949
01:38:44,582 --> 01:38:48,586
It sounds good, Colonel, but your
attack force up that cliff in three hours...

950
01:38:48,586 --> 01:38:51,856
...with weapons, ammunition, food?

951
01:38:51,856 --> 01:38:54,191
You must have remarkable faith
in your men.

952
01:38:54,191 --> 01:38:56,360
Yes, sir, I have.

953
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,353
Faith moves mountains,
it doesn't take them.

954
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:03,868
How would you know until we try?

955
01:39:03,868 --> 01:39:07,861
Overlooking your disrespect,
there's no sense trying what can't be done.

956
01:39:10,641 --> 01:39:14,312
I hope the Germans have
the same sensible attitude.

957
01:39:14,312 --> 01:39:18,215
Lf, in their opinion, it can't be done,
they won't be expecting us.

958
01:39:18,215 --> 01:39:22,208
That'll give us a chance to get from here
to here without being discovered.

959
01:39:22,787 --> 01:39:26,624
I tell you,
that's the only way it can be done...

960
01:39:26,624 --> 01:39:30,617
...with all respect.

961
01:39:43,874 --> 01:39:46,644
Any further comments?

962
01:39:46,644 --> 01:39:50,637
You'll get your artillery support, Colonel.
Good luck.

963
01:39:51,349 --> 01:39:55,342
Thank you, sir. General.

964
01:40:10,701 --> 01:40:14,305
They're giving us artillery until 09:00.

965
01:40:14,305 --> 01:40:17,341
By that time, we have to be on top.

966
01:40:17,341 --> 01:40:19,877
Our one and only chance is surprise.

967
01:40:19,877 --> 01:40:23,870
- How much of a chance is that?
- Ask me tomorrow.

968
01:40:24,715 --> 01:40:27,251
Ask me now.

969
01:40:27,251 --> 01:40:29,687
This'll be their Dunkirk.

970
01:40:29,687 --> 01:40:31,856
We'll whip 'em this time.

971
01:40:31,856 --> 01:40:35,860
There'll be nothing stopping us
but a white flag.

972
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,896
I'd settle to be alive tomorrow night.

973
01:40:38,896 --> 01:40:41,032
- Wonder how many...
- 20 minutes.

974
01:40:41,032 --> 01:40:45,025
Pass the word, 20 minutes.

975
01:40:59,083 --> 01:41:03,076
That's quite a load, soldier.

976
01:41:07,058 --> 01:41:11,051
Good luck, son.

977
01:41:16,067 --> 01:41:20,060
Double-check all weapons, Captain.

978
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:28,679
Ornery...

979
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:30,681
...send my love to your wife.

980
01:41:30,681 --> 01:41:34,674
If you don't make it out of here,
I'll give it to her myself, in person.

981
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,956
I didn't mean it,
you know me better than that.

982
01:41:38,956 --> 01:41:42,949
- I know you.
- You all packed up?

983
01:41:44,061 --> 01:41:45,696
How is everybody? In good shape?

984
01:41:45,696 --> 01:41:49,366
- Fine, thanks, sir.
- Great.

985
01:41:49,366 --> 01:41:53,359
- Leave something for the mules.
- I will, sir.

986
01:41:54,839 --> 01:41:57,741
Be sure everyone has a sweater on.
It's gonna be cold.

987
01:41:57,741 --> 01:42:01,679
Sweater, yes, sir. I'll check 'em out.

988
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,547
You okay?

989
01:42:03,547 --> 01:42:07,084
- As well as could be expected, sir.
- Need anything?

990
01:42:07,084 --> 01:42:10,955
Yes, sir, an honorable discharge.

991
01:42:10,955 --> 01:42:13,657
Stick around.
You'll get one if you deserve it.

992
01:42:13,657 --> 01:42:14,959
- Sgt. Peacock?
- Sir.

993
01:42:14,959 --> 01:42:17,661
- How are your men?
- The best, sir.

994
01:42:17,661 --> 01:42:21,654
- Take care.
- Will do, sir.

995
01:42:21,732 --> 01:42:24,168
How about that?

996
01:42:24,168 --> 01:42:27,805
What's eating him?

997
01:42:27,805 --> 01:42:31,798
Have you never heard a man say good-bye?

998
01:43:16,487 --> 01:43:19,657
Holy cow. It's straight up.

999
01:43:19,657 --> 01:43:23,650
What's the beef? It's only a mile high.

1000
01:44:41,872 --> 01:44:45,865
Greco, Guthrie, Gatling, Smith.

1001
01:44:47,711 --> 01:44:51,704
Three hours of artillery.
Three hours only. Let's go.

1002
01:45:32,256 --> 01:45:35,793
Batteries ready.

1003
01:45:35,793 --> 01:45:39,786
Batteries fire!

1004
01:47:19,363 --> 01:47:20,964
This is as far as we can go.

1005
01:47:20,964 --> 01:47:22,132
- Overhang?
- Yeah.

1006
01:47:22,132 --> 01:47:26,125
Give me your grappling hook.

1007
01:48:01,805 --> 01:48:05,798
No, Bronc.
This is my part of the act, right?

1008
01:49:12,175 --> 01:49:16,168
We're okay.
There was only one guard on this side.

1009
01:49:18,115 --> 01:49:22,108
Move. Get the ropes over fast.

1010
01:49:38,268 --> 01:49:42,261
Secure the ropes. Let's get moving fast.

1011
01:51:57,574 --> 01:52:01,567
Keep your head down.

1012
01:52:03,146 --> 01:52:07,139
- Keep down.
- They're over the ridge, sir.

1013
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:12,712
Stay low. Fix your gear.

1014
01:52:29,139 --> 01:52:33,132
Spread out. Keep down.

1015
01:54:58,421 --> 01:55:02,414
Keep down.

1016
01:56:19,235 --> 01:56:21,671
- Give 'em hell!
- Cover fire!

1017
01:56:21,671 --> 01:56:25,664
Come on, you don't live forever.

1018
01:56:46,429 --> 01:56:48,765
Bastards!

1019
01:56:48,765 --> 01:56:52,758
- Move out.
- Come on! Let's go!

1020
01:57:33,076 --> 01:57:37,069
Look out, Bronc!

1021
01:58:03,473 --> 01:58:07,466
- We made it. By God, we made it.
- Not yet. Keep the fire up.

1022
01:58:07,744 --> 01:58:11,737
Damn right. We'll keep it up.

1023
01:58:52,789 --> 01:58:56,782
Medic!

1024
01:59:07,770 --> 01:59:10,106
- Help me.
- Don't worry.

1025
01:59:10,106 --> 01:59:14,099
I fix you good. Don't worry, bad boy.

1026
01:59:15,378 --> 01:59:19,371
Give my love to your wife.

1027
01:59:30,426 --> 01:59:34,419
Cover me, Colonel!

1028
02:00:20,043 --> 02:00:21,878
Damn it to hell. Medic!

1029
02:00:21,878 --> 02:00:23,546
- Keep moving.
- Shove it!

1030
02:00:23,546 --> 02:00:26,149
- Keep moving!
- Medic!

1031
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:27,617
Come on.

1032
02:00:27,617 --> 02:00:31,610
I can't...

1033
02:00:34,691 --> 02:00:38,684
All right! Come on!

1034
02:00:53,676 --> 02:00:57,669
Keep down over there.
Fan out and keep moving.

1035
02:01:06,489 --> 02:01:10,482
Medic!

1036
02:01:19,535 --> 02:01:23,528
There you are, my friend.
The pain will be gone in one minute.

1037
02:01:29,178 --> 02:01:33,082
Be right back.

1038
02:01:33,082 --> 02:01:36,686
- How 'bout the bullet?
- We have no doctor here.

1039
02:01:36,686 --> 02:01:38,788
We'll get him down the hill
as soon as we can.

1040
02:01:38,788 --> 02:01:40,123
How soon?

1041
02:01:40,123 --> 02:01:44,116
When we have men to carry him,
if he's still alive.

1042
02:01:48,031 --> 02:01:50,667
Tony, I need a big crowd
to help carry a wounded man.

1043
02:01:50,667 --> 02:01:53,303
- Take your pick.
- You. Get up.

1044
02:01:53,303 --> 02:01:55,204
You speak English?

1045
02:01:55,204 --> 02:01:59,197
Never mind. It don't matter. Come on.

1046
02:02:07,083 --> 02:02:11,076
Pick him up. Up!

1047
02:02:14,991 --> 02:02:18,984
Easy.

1048
02:03:01,838 --> 02:03:03,840
What?

1049
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,833
- Put me down.
- Okay. Over there.

1050
02:03:13,983 --> 02:03:17,976
Water.

1051
02:03:18,388 --> 02:03:20,857
Don't be stupid. You got a belly wound.

1052
02:03:20,857 --> 02:03:24,850
You get no water, so just go to sleep.

1053
02:03:33,836 --> 02:03:37,829
Rocky!

1054
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:52,344
Peacock!

1055
02:03:56,058 --> 02:04:00,051
No!

1056
02:04:11,107 --> 02:04:14,143
Come on. Let's go.

1057
02:04:14,143 --> 02:04:18,136
- Keep 'em covered.
- Let's do it. Let's go.

1058
02:04:18,247 --> 02:04:22,240
Get going.

1059
02:04:55,218 --> 02:04:59,055
Hold the mortars!

1060
02:04:59,055 --> 02:05:01,991
Cease fire.

1061
02:05:01,991 --> 02:05:05,984
Keep 'em covered.

1062
02:05:28,451 --> 02:05:31,254
Major, this is your white flag.

1063
02:05:31,254 --> 02:05:35,247
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, indeed.

1064
02:05:49,171 --> 02:05:52,174
I'm ready to discuss surrender
under the following conditions...

1065
02:05:52,174 --> 02:05:54,510
You'll discuss nothing.

1066
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:58,503
You'll keep your mouth shut and listen
while I tell you the conditions.

1067
02:06:03,553 --> 02:06:06,322
Keep me covered. Watch them.

1068
02:06:06,322 --> 02:06:08,824
Come on out of there. Come out!

1069
02:06:08,824 --> 02:06:12,817
Come on! Move it!

1070
02:06:16,999 --> 02:06:19,835
He's dead, sir. Come on.

1071
02:06:19,835 --> 02:06:23,172
There may be a counterattack.
We've got to be ready.

1072
02:06:23,172 --> 02:06:24,907
See that we are.

1073
02:06:24,907 --> 02:06:28,110
How about reporting to Gen. Hunter?
Shall I do that?

1074
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:32,103
No, I will. Take care of him.
Come on out of there. Come out!

1075
02:06:32,348 --> 02:06:36,341
- Keep 'em covered.
- Hands over your head!

1076
02:06:41,057 --> 02:06:45,050
Keep moving.

1077
02:06:47,563 --> 02:06:49,498
Keep going.

1078
02:06:49,498 --> 02:06:51,867
Come on. Close it up.

1079
02:06:51,867 --> 02:06:55,860
Hands over your head!

1080
02:06:57,406 --> 02:07:01,399
Keep your hands up.

1081
02:07:10,653 --> 02:07:14,256
We didn't surprise them
as completely as I had hoped.

1082
02:07:14,256 --> 02:07:18,249
Our losses were more than I...

1083
02:07:19,395 --> 02:07:22,264
...made allowance for...

1084
02:07:22,264 --> 02:07:26,035
...including my top-ranking Canadian.

1085
02:07:26,035 --> 02:07:30,028
A fine officer. I'll miss him.

1086
02:07:32,375 --> 02:07:35,344
We're getting some artillery fire.

1087
02:07:35,344 --> 02:07:38,581
If there's a counterattack, we'll be ready.

1088
02:07:38,581 --> 02:07:42,251
We're prepared to hold until relieved.

1089
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:45,187
That's all from here, sir. Over.

1090
02:07:45,187 --> 02:07:47,623
That's not all from here.

1091
02:07:47,623 --> 02:07:51,027
We tried for three weeks to take
what you took in three hours.

1092
02:07:51,027 --> 02:07:54,597
I want to tell you, it's absolutely fantastic,
and it's magnificent.

1093
02:07:54,597 --> 02:07:57,199
I'm going to recommend
the entire unit for a citation.

1094
02:07:57,199 --> 02:08:00,169
I want to say to you, Colonel,
I couldn't be more delighted...

1095
02:08:00,169 --> 02:08:03,606
...that I was absolutely wrong,
and you were 100% right.

1096
02:08:03,606 --> 02:08:04,940
I'm pretty happy.

1097
02:08:04,940 --> 02:08:08,933
I want you to give my congratulations
to every officer and man in the brigade.

1098
02:08:09,045 --> 02:08:13,038
They've unlocked the whole front
and got us moving again.

1099
02:08:31,233 --> 02:08:35,226
They say you find out what something
is worth when you pay for it.

1100
02:08:36,439 --> 02:08:39,508
Well, la Difensa was ours now.

1101
02:08:39,508 --> 02:08:41,977
Not much of a mountain, really.

1102
02:08:41,977 --> 02:08:45,247
But I never knew that
a mountain could be so tall...

1103
02:08:45,247 --> 02:08:49,240
...or plain rock cost so much.

1104
02:09:03,399 --> 02:09:07,169
We'd won a battle, but the war went on.

1105
02:09:07,169 --> 02:09:11,162
Beyond la Difensa lay more peaks,
more Germans, more bloody fights.

1106
02:09:12,608 --> 02:09:16,601
Mount Remetanea, Sammucro,
Radicosa, Anzio...

1107
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:20,116
...and finally Rome.

1108
02:09:20,116 --> 02:09:23,152
As the men fought, their legend grew.

1109
02:09:23,152 --> 02:09:26,055
In all its history,
the force never retreated...

1110
02:09:26,055 --> 02:09:29,291
...never surrendered an inch of ground.

1111
02:09:29,291 --> 02:09:31,660
But the price was high.

1112
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:34,330
The American misfits
and the proud Canadians...

1113
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:38,200
...lay dead in a hundred fields
and crossroads.

1114
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:40,703
Together they had built a myth.

1115
02:09:40,703 --> 02:09:44,696
Too many died to keep it true.
