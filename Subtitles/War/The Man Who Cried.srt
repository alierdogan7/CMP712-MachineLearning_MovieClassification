1
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,249
Fegele. Fegele.

2
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:19,163
Ah. Ah.

3
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:31,348
Fegele?

4
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,989
Fegele?

5
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,389
Hmm.

6
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:22,162
Olive.

7
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:24,604
Drusilla.

8
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,406
Richard.

9
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,920
Susan.

10
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,997
Suzie.

11
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:38,004
For a black-eyed
little Susan, eh?

12
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:43,416
What's this then?

13
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,395
America.

14
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,285
No.

15
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,390
England, dear.

16
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,637
Shall I have that?

17
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:13,883
Let me have that,
shall I?

18
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:16,766
Uh, would you
give it to me?

19
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,092
Can't I have it?

20
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:30,588
It's for her own good,
mind, because it will
only make her upset.

21
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,762
There. That's better
then, Suzie.

22
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,004
Isn't it?
Nice and clean.

23
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,801
Where are you from?

24
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:58,656
Where is she from?
She don't know.

25
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,860
She can't speak.

26
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,225
Maybe she don't
speak English.
She's a gypsy.

27
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,073
Gypsy.
Raggle-taggle gypsy.

28
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:26,012
Stop it!

29
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:41,055
Gypsies! Come and have
a look at the gypsies.

30
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,499
All things bright
and beautiful

31
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:49,023
All, all
Things.

32
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:51,300
All
Things.

33
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,343
"Tings"
"Tings"
Things.

34
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,416
Things. Things.
Bright.
Things

35
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,528
Br--

36
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:01,383
Bright and beautiful.
Bright.

37
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:04,067
Canish.

38
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,439
Canish.
No!

39
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:12,287
No more of that!
Now, you're in England now.

40
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:15,078
So you speak English,
don't you?

41
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,708
They wouldn't let me
speak Welsh, either.

42
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,877
But it did me
the world of good...

43
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:25,856
in the end.

44
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:32,233
You see, Suzie,
you've got to
learn to fit in.

45
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:41,316
Am laid

46
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:43,973
In earth

47
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:48,833
May my wrongs create

48
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,795
No trouble

49
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:59,203
No trouble
in thy breast

50
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:07,019
Remember me

51
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:13,483
Remember me

52
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:20,197
But

53
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:24,393
Forget my fate

54
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:29,218
Nice, dear. Very nice.
But I'm afraid a nice voice
is not quite enough.

55
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:33,004
You see, our girls are famous
on the continent for their legs.

56
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,478
And other things.

57
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:48,293
- Why are you here,
actually, dear?
- I want to go to America.

58
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,636
Ah, I see.
Another one.

59
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:54,631
Well, I suppose Paris is
a step in the right direction.

60
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:57,092
And there's no harm
in dreaming, dear.

61
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,851
I like a bit of ambition
in my girls.

62
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,326
Which way?
Here.

63
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,397
We'll follow you.
I don't know
where we're going.

64
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,699
we should go out tonight.
I'll show you how to have fun.

65
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:02,803
Listen. Do you
speak French?
Um, not really.

66
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,475
I can teach you some
very important words which,
you must know, are amour--

67
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:10,129
So you live
all by yourself,
you poor little duck.

68
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:13,265
Oh, this is, you know,
not too bad.

69
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:15,921
There's plenty of room.

70
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:19,341
In Moscow there would be
three families in here.

71
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:29,108
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving.

72
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,275
- What for?
- To go to America.

73
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:35,671
Suzie, you take my advice.

74
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,290
Buy yourself a nice dress...

75
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,776
and you will find a rich man
who will take you there, hmm?

76
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,121
I have a plan.

77
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:50,292
I will help you
find little extra jobs.

78
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,751
What kind of jobs?
Oh, cabarets, parties.

79
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:58,041
Oh, Suzie, it's easy if you know
the right people. And I will
stay here with you, yes?

80
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:00,724
And we will share everything,
everything. And...

81
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:03,609
maybe we will have
money left in our pocket
at the end of the week.

82
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,813
It's a good idea, yes?

83
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,825
Hello.

84
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,511
- Something is missing.
- Like what?

85
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:11,891
Huh? The food.

86
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,908
My friends.

87
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:15,805
Even the cold.

88
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,772
This is nothing.

89
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:21,213
Winter was winter
in Moscow.

90
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:23,613
But that's all finished with.

91
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,915
Forward.

92
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:28,536
Forward. We must always
look forward.

93
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,980
Isn't that true, Suzie?

94
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,586
This is my father.

95
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,163
That's your father, yes.

96
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,575
Abramovitch.

97
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,984
But this is in Russian.

98
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:11,036
Why didn't you
tell me before?

99
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:26,140
Suzie?

100
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:31,650
You don't
understand Russian?

101
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:39,486
Abramovitch.

102
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:42,010
Ah.

103
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,466
So, he was a Jew.

104
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:20,609
Silence. Silence, everyone.
Please, mes amis.

105
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:25,020
Tonight we're lucky to have
the guest star of Felix
Perlman's new opera company.

106
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:30,626
So please welcome Dante Dominio
who has kindly agreed
to sing something for us.

107
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:04,938
The best.
The best--
You are fantastic.

108
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:08,801
I just had to
say that to you,
that's all.

109
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,902
Ah, the girl with the horse.
Oh, yes, but I don't
usually do that.

110
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,110
Oh, no?
No, no, no.
I'm a dancer, actually.

111
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,089
Ah, really?
Trained dancer.

112
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:19,106
Uh-huh. Where?

113
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,089
Uh, from Kirov.

114
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,907
So, you, uh,
liked it, then?
Oh, yes!

115
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:27,208
You are--
You're sublime.

116
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:30,059
I can't imagine, myself,
how it must be to--

117
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:32,426
to be on the stage
at the same time as you.

118
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:35,974
You know, just somewhere
in the background listening,

119
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:38,827
in the chorus,
for example.

120
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:41,228
Felix.

121
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:44,806
This, uh,
young Russian lady...

122
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:48,490
should come
to your auditions.
And I have a friend.

123
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,525
She can sing.
Oh, is that so?

124
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:54,566
Say has a lovely voice.
La bella bambola.

125
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:57,453
She's very talented.
Eh?

126
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:01,893
So you sing too?
No. l-- A little,
little bit, but I dance.

127
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,034
Suzie, there you are.

128
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:24,293
There.

129
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,208
Hold it! Hold everything.

130
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,314
Hold it.
Felix, you really
want me to stand here?

131
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:38,825
Not over there, huh?
No, over there, Dante.

132
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:41,995
Here you block the entrance
of the horse.

133
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:44,966
The horse?

134
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,343
It-- It looks good, Dante.

135
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,897
"It"? "It" looked good?

136
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:54,988
Felix, tell me.
Is this, uh, opera
or a spectacle?

137
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:57,709
I see no contradiction.
Allora,
I put another way.

138
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:01,094
Do you want the public
to look or to listen?

139
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,138
Both, Dante, both.
The eyes and the ears.
Ah.

140
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:08,301
It's opera for the people.
And the people need
to be entertained.

141
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,410
I came to Paris to sing.

142
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:15,184
Strangely, I believe
the public are coming
to listen to me,

143
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:17,585
not to look at scenery
or horses.

144
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,670
But then what
do I know, huh?

145
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:26,001
Mmm. I am just
a foolish singer.

146
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:48,114
Hello.
Ecola.

147
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,344
La bella bambola.
Hey.
Mm-hmm. Lola.

148
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:53,518
Lola. Bellissima.

149
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:59,311
Now you are here,
with us, huh?
Yes. Thank you very much.

150
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:01,291
Bellissimo.

151
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,902
Yes, it's a great,
great aria.

152
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:16,724
You see, Verdi,
he understands that...

153
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,100
the voice can express
the highest ideals for man--

154
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:24,403
his search for strength
and glory...

155
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,884
and beauty.

156
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,013
Madonna.

157
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,356
No, but what is it like
to be a star,

158
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:36,943
to have everybody
looking at you
all the time?

159
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:40,790
I was not always
where I am now.
Really?

160
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:44,565
Oh, no.
When I was a child,
we had nothing, nothing.

161
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:47,599
But that is incredible.
We were immigrants.

162
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:51,633
Allora, from the south
of Italy to the north.

163
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:53,679
It was cold?

164
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:57,943
It is the people.
They look down on you
if you come from the south.

165
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,463
How terrible.
And because we were poor,

166
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:05,108
we all lived
in one little room--
the whole family.

167
00:30:05,176 --> 00:30:07,664
No. The whole family?

168
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:14,128
That must have been
so difficult for you.

169
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,724
Come on.

170
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,704
No.

171
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,673
Did you see
how he looked at me?

172
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,112
You see, Suzie,

173
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,668
there are rules
of how you get your man.

174
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:55,511
Rules? What rules?

175
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,482
Well, first,

176
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,141
you must play hard to get.

177
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:06,548
If it is too easy,
he loses interest. He must
feel that he is, uh, a hunter,

178
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,417
and you are a beautiful
wild animal he is hunting.

179
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,882
It's a primitive instinct,
you see.

180
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:15,924
Second, if you want to make
a man want you,

181
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:19,827
and only you,
you must smile.

182
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:23,065
And you must listen.
You always listen.

183
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:27,444
Mmm. He needs attention.
Men, you see, they are very,

184
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,558
very fragile.

185
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,940
And third,
you must look good.

186
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:36,632
Very good.

187
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:39,669
Actually, that's probably
the most important thing of all.

188
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:41,847
You know, without my looks,

189
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:44,821
I would never have
got out of Russia.

190
00:31:44,894 --> 00:31:47,993
Never. Will you tell me
something frankly, Suzie?

191
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:50,648
Do you think...

192
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:54,167
I should get my hair
bleached some more or
should I leave it like this?

193
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,759
Hmm?

194
00:32:57,251 --> 00:33:00,447
So what do you think
explains the rise of Fascism
in your country?

195
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:04,922
An artist must be
above politics.

196
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:08,956
- Don't you agree, Felix?
- So they say.

197
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:11,897
But, you know,
there has been "caos."

198
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,339
- Come se dice "caos"?
- Chaos.

199
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:16,859
Chaos. Chaos and confusion
in my country.

200
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:20,926
Mussolini believes
in order and organization.

201
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:25,055
He understands that the Italian
people must regain back...

202
00:33:25,124 --> 00:33:27,196
their self-respect.

203
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:30,530
By putting on black shirts
and marching up and down
in one of those rallies?

204
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,770
Ah, you intellectual, huh?

205
00:33:36,837 --> 00:33:40,929
For the working man,
the rallies are about
dignity and strength.

206
00:33:40,997 --> 00:33:46,496
The lighting, the music,
the choreography creates
an atmosphere.

207
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:51,781
- Magnifico!
- Mussolini most certainly has
a great sense of theater.

208
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:54,083
Certo. Certo, huh?

209
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,565
And everything he does,
huh, is big.

210
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:00,638
Yes. Yes.

211
00:34:04,454 --> 00:34:09,343
You could learn something,
Felix. He really knows how
to reach his public, huh?

212
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,776
Felix, thank you
very much.

213
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:47,902
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

214
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,637
Let's go.
They're just gypsies.

215
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:33,447
So you, uh,
sleep here, hmm?

216
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:36,973
And your, uh, friend...

217
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,461
sleeps over there?

218
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,608
Da.

219
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:54,861
This is, uh,

220
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:56,935
how it was...

221
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,942
for me.

222
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,959
Yes.

223
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:06,310
This is, uh, how it was.

224
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:15,498
My mother and a baby
in one bed.

225
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,207
And my brothers and me
in the other.

226
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,074
End to end.

227
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,062
The sacrifices my mother
made for me.

228
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,960
But why?

229
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:05,996
Why did your
little friend, huh,

230
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:08,654
refuse my invitation?

231
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:31,411
It's here.

232
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:59,027
It's too big for you,
the room?

233
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:02,710
Perhaps soon there'll be
not two, not three, but four
occupants in the residence.

234
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:11,666
Would you say that again,
Madame Goldstein?

235
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:24,534
So now I understand
why you didn't seem like
the other English girls.

236
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:28,789
Eat.
Thank you.

237
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,877
Isn't it gorgeous?

238
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,471
Did he
buy that too?
Yes.
