Dad, is Bobs a very big soldier?

171
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,714
Lord Roberts, if you please.
He's head of all the soldiers.

172
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,345
- Who's head of all the Boers?
- President Kruger.

173
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,434
And you and Bobs
are going to fight Kruger?

174
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,056
(LAUGHS) That's right.

175
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,481
Are you going to cut Kruger
all in pieces with your sword?

- You blood-thirsty little devil!
- Oh, promise you will, Daddy.

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,812

- Mother.

I'm glad I didn't bring Edward and Joey.

All the officers on the ship wagered him

that he would not win the hand
of Princess Mirabelle.

Mum, will Father be riding in the beginning

00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,119
At the beginning, darling.

503

that go in front of the gun carriage

so patient and quiet.

on a lovely white horse!

511

Oh, darling, don't jump about
and get excited.

512
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,854
- Edward, keep Joey quiet.
- Yes, Mum.

513
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,530
- Mum, could I ever be a policeman?
- Perhaps, if you're very good.

514
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,870
- Are all policemen good?
- Oh, as good <i>as</i> gold.

515
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:17,082
Why did Queen Victoria die, Mum?

516
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,708
Because she was a very old lady
and very tired.

517
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,048
Could I have another piece of cake?

518
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,091
Only a tiny piece, then.

- Yes.

- There now, run along.
- All right.

523
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,352
- Here, Edith. Here's your piece.
- Thank you.

- That one.

- Yes, it is.

He hasn't anymore.

We really must be going now.

It was ever so kind of you, milady,
to come all this way to see us

671

and to give Fanny that lovely doll
and everything.

Don't laugh.

836
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,053
I'd love to be on board. Wouldn't you?

837
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,260
Together?

838
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,560
- Perhaps.
- We'll be seasick.

839
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,983
- Hideously.
- Oh, everyone is.

840
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,603
- What?
- Seasick hideously.

841
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:38,938
Horrors.

842
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,742
All the same, I'd risk it.

843
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,572
Would you? Together?

844
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,037
On the loveliest ship in the world.

845
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,662

- Well, that's to be expected in mid-ocean.

We're nearing the banks of Newfoundland.

- EDWARD: Oh, much, much too deep.

(CHUCKLES) Not a scrap.

860
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,310
Wouldn't it be awful
if a magician came to us and said,

- We should die tonight?

How much would you mind...
Dying, I mean?

864
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,953
Oh, I don't know. A good deal, I expect.

865
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,293
I don't believe I should mind so very much.

866
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,838
You see, we could never in our whole lives

867
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,291
be any happier than we are now.

- Exactly.

Oh, Edward.
It's rather disheartening, isn't it?

872
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,725
I do so want this to be unique.

873
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,936
It is, for us.

874
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,605
Did you ever think when we were children,

875
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,988
- going to the pantomime and the zoo...
- That we should end up by getting married?

876

- Mm-hmmm.
- Of course I didn't.

877
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,825
You were a horrible child.

Well, so were you. And so was Joey. Vile.

00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,076
Yet we all liked each other, really.

880
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,202
Dear Joey.

881
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,129
He's passing gallantly through
the chorus girl phase now, isn't he?

882
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,674
Mm. Gallantly but not quickly.

883
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:49,469
- Well, darling, you took your time over it.
- Now, Edith.

Didn't you?

Light of my life, shut up.

886
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,519
You'd be awfully cross if I'd had affairs.

887
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,977
- If you'd what?
- Had affairs.

888

Love affairs before you.

- You didn't.
- Hundreds.

(CHUCKLES) You liar.

891
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,741
I rather wish I had sometimes.

892
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,865
Perhaps then I should have learned
some tricks to hold you with

893
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,043
when you begin to get tired of me.

894
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,246
I shall never do that, tricks or no tricks.

01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,376
Oh, yes, you will one day.

896
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,875
People always do.

897
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,637
This complete loveliness will fade,
and we shall forget what it was like.

898
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,135
- Edith, don't.
- Oh, it's bound to.

899
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,477
Just a few years and the gilt wears off
the gingerbread.

900
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,186
Darling, answer me one thing truthfully.

901
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,268
Have you ever seen gingerbread
with gilt on it?

902
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,776
- Oh, fool!
- Then the whole argument is disposed of.

903
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,318
Anyway, look at Father and Mother.

904
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,992
They're perfectly happy
and always have been.

905
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:57,537
Oh, yes, but they had
a better chance in the beginning.

906

and life wasn't so restless.

01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,960

Of course you can't.

1170
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,964
So I'll give it to you now.

What?

1172
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,976
Just a little something I had made for you.

1173
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,646
With my love.

1174
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,684
Oh, how marvelous.

1175
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:23,531
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a reminder of all the fun we've had.

You're a darling.

Oh, but you've missed the whole point.

1179
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:45,549
I'll keep it... Forever and ever...

1180
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,255
And ever.

1181
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,351
Oh, darling, I almost wish
I didn't love you quite so terribly.

1182
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,938

just a bit too thick somehow.

Yes, but I wouldn't.

1196

- Oh, why not?
- Too difficult.

1197
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,994
Besides, we shouldn't be happy married.

- She'd be all right.

Don't be too sweet to me, Joey.
