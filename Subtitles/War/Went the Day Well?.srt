1
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,209
Good day to you.

2
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,137
Come to have a look at Bramley End,
have you?

3
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,723
Pretty little place,

4
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,393
and a nice old church, too.

5
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,389
13th century, parts of it.

6
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,269
Still, it won't be that that's brought you,
I don't suppose.

7
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,984
It'll be these names on this grave here

8
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,158
and the story that's buried along with them.

9
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,991
Look funny, don't they?

10
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,906
German names in an English churchyard.

11
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,080
They wanted England, these Jerries did,

12
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,578
and this is the only bit they got.

13
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,134
The Battle of Bramley End,
that's what the papers called it.

14
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,213
Nothing was said about it
'till after the war was over

15
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,798
and old Hitler got what was coming to him.

16
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,637
Whitsun weekend it was, 1942.

17
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,432
As peaceful and quiet here then, as it is now,

18
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,267
even though there was a war on.

19
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,361
It was Saturday morning
when those army lorries

20
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,609
came rumbling along the road from Upton.

21
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,706
<i>We'd have laughed if you'd told us
we'd got a real live German</i>

22
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,783
<i>right under our very noses</i>

23
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,253
<i>and we'd have thought you was
a bit weak in the upper storey</i>

24
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,797
<i>if you'd said the chaps in those lorries</i>

25
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,502
<i>was anything else
but ordinary British Tommies.</i>

26
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,471
<i>Pretty soon we learned better</i>

27
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,426
<i>and no mistake.</i>

28
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,150
- Morning, Peg.
- Morning, darling.

29
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,704
Well, we'll be sharing a bottle after tomorrow.

30
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,201
- Promise me something.
- What?

31
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,158
You'll never come home with the milk.

32
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,125
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

33
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,878
Could you tell me
where the village policeman lives?

34
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,880
Yes, the cottage beyond the one
with the porch.

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,427
Oh, thanks awfully.

36
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,630
We have to see about billeting our men.

37
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,137
Looks as though I shall have company
while you and Tom's on your honeymoon.

38
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,096
Now you behave yourself, my girl.

39
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,352
Well, I'll do my best.

40
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,107
Wonder what they'd come here for.

41
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,561
Nothing that'll make any difference to you,
my girl.

42
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,065
You get on with your work.

43
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,371
Whatever can soldiers be doing in Bramley?

44
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,540
Exercise probably, Mrs Carter.

45
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,868
Funny way to take exercise riding in lorries.

46
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,965
Good morning.
Are you the police officer here?

47
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,798
Yes, sir. I was just shaving, overslept like.

48
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,807
Begging your pardon
for coming to the door like this, sir.

49
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,351
That's all right. Here's the billeting notice.

50
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,473
What for, sir?

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,805
Didn't the Billeting Officer warn you
about our arrival?

52
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,107
No, sir. Care to step inside?

53
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,815
We shall need billets for 60 men.
For about three nights.

54
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,738
60 men, sir? That's a large order
for a small village like this.

55
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,987
I dare say, but there's a war on, you know.

56
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,239
I could squeeze about half of them in, sir,
but as for the rest...

57
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,410
You'll have to, I'm afraid.

58
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,911
Oh, there's the village hall, sir.
There's room there for a tidy few, I reckon.

59
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,366
Maybe you'd care to have a word
with the vicar, sir?

60
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,541
Certainly. Where is the vicarage?

61
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,961
- Just along past the church.
- Maxwell, you take the car and go

62
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,913
-with the constable to the other billets.
- Right, sir.

63
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,983
- Mr Ashton'?
- Yes, my father's in.

64
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,067
Could I see him?

65
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,778
- Well, will you come this way?
- Thanks.

66
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,538
Good morning, sir.

67
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,418
Oh, I didn't realise.
I'm afraid I'm disturbing you.

68
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,170
- Not at all.
- My name's Hammond.

69
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,547
- Do sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

70
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,754
I'm in charge of a party of sappers. Hello!

71
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,215
We've been sent to do
a job of work down here.

72
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,891
- In Bramley?
- Yes.

73
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,435
Really? My dear, another cup.

74
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,184
Oh, that's very charming of you.
We've been on the road for hours.

75
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,061
So, what can I do for you?

76
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,642
Well, sir, it's a question of billets.

77
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,854
The local policeman said that you might be
kind enough to lend us the village hall.

78
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,109
Well, what do you think, Nora?

79
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,408
Well, I don't see why not, Father.
First Aid can always meet here.

80
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,577
Yes, I see no reason why not.

81
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,996
Oh, splendid, thanks very much.

82
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,449
You needn't worry about damage
or anything of that sort.

83
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,250
They're a very good lot of fellows.

84
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,919
- Milk and sugar?
- Please.

85
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,838
And your own sleeping quarters,
have you made arrangements about them?

86
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,259
Not yet, sir. One likes to get the men
fixed up first, you know. Oh, thanks.

87
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,177
We have a spare room here.

88
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,131
It's rather a cubbyhole, I'm afraid,
but you'd be most welcome.

89
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,932
Well, that's extremely kind of you, sir,

90
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,934
if you're sure it won't cause
a lot of inconvenience.

91
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,887
I mean, I expect you're understaffed and...

92
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,893
We shall be most offended if you refuse.

93
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,940
Then I accept, of course. Thanks very much.

94
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,361
Good morning. I'm afraid I've come again
to borrow the... Oh, I'm so sorry.

95
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,779
- Oh, do come in.
- All right.

96
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,323
Let's see, the keys of the hall
are with Mrs Collins.

97
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,780
That's the village shop.

98
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,703
You shouldn't have deserted the Army.

99
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,625
I only came to borrow those garden scissors.

100
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,046
The Army wanted Father, not me.
I think the scissors are in this cupboard.

101
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,755
Oh, wait a minute, you've got them.

102
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,677
Don't you remember,
I brought them across on Thursday.

103
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,175
Oh, yes, of course, you did.

104
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,097
I must be getting absent-minded.

105
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,968
The penalty of middle age.

106
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,724
Don't be absurd, you're not middle-aged.

107
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,056
I've got a wedding
after morning service tomorrow.

108
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,891
Young Tom Sturry, our innkeeper's son,

109
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,149
but, of course, if you're thinking
of holding a church parade...

110
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,572
Oh, I'm afraid we'll have to work
right through Sunday, sir.

111
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,821
You see, we've only been given a few days
to do this job and, much as we'd like to...

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,119
Oh, yes, quite, quite, I quite understand.

113
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,203
- This is Mr Wilsford, Mr Hammond.
- How do you do'?

114
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,999
You should have said
Corporal Wilsford, Father.

115
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,954
Mr Wilsford is the leading light
of our Home Guard.

116
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,504
Though considering
all he's done for the village,

117
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,331
he ought to be a brigadier at least.

118
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,009
Home Guard, eh?
You're just the man I want to see.

119
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,008
We've been sent along to put
the village in a state of general defence.

120
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,717
General defence?
Dear me, that sounds very alarming.

121
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,426
Merely a routine matter.

122
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,012
You know, Father,
machine-gun posts, barbed wire,

123
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,597
like they have over at Upton Ferrars.

124
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,024
Who's your O.C.? I'd like to get hold of him
<i>as</i> soon as possible.

125
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,851
There's a fellow called Drew. Lieutenant Drew.

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,732
He's the baker over at Upton.

127
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,358
He'll be here on his rounds quite soon.

128
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,781
Good. In the meantime,
perhaps you could give me

129
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,325
-a rough idea of the tactical layout.
- By all means.

130
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,319
Then I won't disturb your breakfast
any further.

131
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,279
I'll send my kit over later, if I may,

132
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,990
and thanks again for your hospitality.

133
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,459
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

134
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,292
I'd like to be at the manor
this morning, Father.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,592
Why, my dear, what do you mean?

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,888
Well, poor Mrs Fraser.
Haven't we rather stolen the guest of honour?

137
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,964
On!

138
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,558
Sit down, Mr Maxwell. Give me your pencil.

139
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,720
- The cigarettes are on the table by your side.
- Thanks.

140
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,805
Let's tackle the problem in a practical way.

141
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,482
Six at least at West's Farm.

142
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,687
- Well, ma'am, I enquired at the farm and...
- Six at West's Farm.

143
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,397
Then Mrs Rogers need only have one.

144
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,609
She said she'd prefer to have two.
She thought it'd be more proper like.

145
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,319
At 73? She's old enough to know better.

146
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,704
Mrs Rogers, one.

147
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,161
One at Farm Cottage?
That's out of the question.

148
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,003
I thought the young ladies
could share for tonight,

149
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,173
seeing that Miss Peggy's going on
her honeymoon tomorrow.

150
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,545
Quite. Leaving Ivy all by herself.

151
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,086
And she certainly isn't old enough
to know better.

152
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,592
As you wish, madam,
but it do seem a waste of a good bed.

153
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,718
Very well,

154
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,059
but you must take the responsibility.

155
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,807
- About here, Mr Maxwell.
- Oh, yes.

156
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,935
I'm cram full of evacuees,
but there's always that sofa,

157
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,814
and if your O.C. isn't outsize,
I shall be only too glad to...

158
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,191
Excuse me.

159
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,945
Hello? Oh, good morning, Nora, dear.

160
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,321
Yes, they're here now.

161
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,991
Garbett wanted to consult me
about the billeting.

162
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,198
I thought you could take...

163
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,200
Who is?

164
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,793
Oh, is he?

165
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,084
Oh, I'm sure that'll be very nice for him.

166
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,296
Yes, I'll give the message.

167
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,501
Goodbye.

168
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,130
Your O.C.'s staying with the Ashtons,

169
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,715
so you'd better have my sofa.

170
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,302
It's a great deal more comfortable than
the vicarage spare bed, I can assure you.

171
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,308
- Oh, thanks.
- You must both dine with me tonight.

172
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,809
- The Ashtons are coming...
- I wish we could,

173
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,982
but we've a lot to do,
I'm afraid we shall be late tonight.

174
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,274
Besides, we've only our battledress.

175
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,442
Oh, <i>as</i> if that matters.

176
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,237
As for dinner, I'll make it whenever you like,
so that's settled.

177
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,655
- You've a car outside?
- Yes.

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,825
Very well then, I'll come with you
and knock some sense into old Mrs Rogers.

179
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,119
Oh, it's an Army car.
I'm afraid civilians are not allowed to...

180
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,537
I don't mind.

181
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,248
Come in.

182
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,500
My, uh...

183
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,839
My housekeeper's out, I sent her to Upton,
so you can speak quite freely.

184
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,966
Good, my orders are to give you
all the necessary information.

185
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,558
- How much do you know already?
- Practically nothing. Do sit down, will you?

186
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,135
Berlin has a maddening habit
of making us work in the dark.

187
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,813
Airborne and seaborne invasion in force
is to be launched on Monday night.

188
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,898
- Monday night?
-No, thanks.

189
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,942
- The day after tomorrow?
- Yes.

190
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,521
Our task is to jam radio-location.

191
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:32,030
With the apparatus we've got,
we can put the British locators out of action.

192
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,236
My unit deals with the central area.

193
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,616
Radius, 300 miles.

194
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,494
But this apparatus
must be extraordinarily complicated,

195
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,870
if it needs all those men to assemble it.

196
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,747
Not to assemble, but to protect it.

197
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,794
If we are found out, we shall be attacked,

198
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,872
and my orders are to hold this village,

199
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,175
and to continue to hold it
for 48 hours after invasion starts.

200
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,550
Uh-huh. Oh,
so that's why you want to contact my O.C?

201
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,974
Exactly. It's always useful to know
one's enemy's plans in advance.

202
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,888
Hello?

203
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,065
- Hello?
- Telegram for you.

204
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,643
<i>- Hold on a second, Violet, while I get a pencil.</i>
- Okay.

205
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,062
I had that pencil of mine a minute ago,

206
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,989
everything seems to be losing itself
this morning.

207
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,407
Daisy, see if you can find those keys for me,
will you? There's a good girl.

208
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,656
What keys was it you was wanting, sir?

209
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,243
- The hall. The village hall.
- Well, they're usually kept...

210
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,125
- Yes, she's already looked there.
- Oh.

211
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,673
That couldn't be them, could it,
hanging up by those ladies'?

212
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,126
Why, so it is.

213
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,680
Found them? That's right.

214
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,178
Sergeant, I'd better come with you,
the lock's a bit tricky.

215
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,886
Daisy, find an envelope for that
and pop up with it to the manor house.

216
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,347
But we've run out of envelopes.
You told me to remind you.

217
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,023
Oh, never mind, they tell us to save paper.

218
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,643
But, wait a minute,
we can't both of us be out at once,

219
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,854
I'll take it, it's only a step further.

220
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,440
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- I hope you won't be long.

221
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,491
- No, why?
- You've got the telephone.

222
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,568
Oh, so <i>I</i> have.

223
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,619
What are those colours for?

224
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,422
- Royal Engineers.
- You ought not to tell.

225
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,380
Oh, the cards, I mustn't take them away.

226
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,086
You boys'll be glad of a game.

227
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,274
Oh! The great, big...

228
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,274
You great, bullying brute, you.
Knocking a child about,

229
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,155
you're a disgrace to your uniform.

230
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,908
Why, you're no better than a German,
that's what you are.

231
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,913
Did you see what this man did?

232
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,662
You report him to your officers at once.

233
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,914
- He was tampering with equipment.
- Well, what if he was?

234
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,995
There's no call for a great, hulking brute...

235
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,673
All right, all right, you'll be on charge for this.
Orders tomorrow morning.

236
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,626
And so I should think.

237
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,971
And let it be a lesson to you, young man,
not to go nosy-parkering.

238
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,089
I shall tell Mrs Fraser about you. Disgraceful!

239
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,849
Well, here we are, sir.

240
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,025
Yes, you can see the whole place from here,

241
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,570
except the manor house,
that's just beyond those trees.

242
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,370
Nice and compact,
easy to defend from up here.

243
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,659
- Have you worked out a plan of defence?
- Oh, yes, sir.

244
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,041
To begin with, I've established
an observation post over there.

245
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,087
- Just behind that hedge, there.
- Good.

246
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,417
- Then I've light machine-gun posts.
- How many'? Whereabouts?

247
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,633
One along the Upton Road, at the bend there.

248
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,637
And the second one
at the top of the school lane.

249
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,686
- The one that runs south from the green.
- Oh, yes.

250
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,811
And the third down the road
past the village hall.

251
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,983
Just near the manor house gates.

252
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,650
If you were the enemy, which direction
would you deliver your main attack from?

253
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,575
The woods around the manor house, sir.

254
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,245
- They give much the best cover.
- Yes.

255
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,118
Well, I think you've told me all I want to know.

256
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,870
You can always give Drew a ring,
if there's anything else.

257
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,326
- That's right.
- Thanks.

258
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,582
I appreciate your cooperation, Mr Drew.

259
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,755
It's going to make my job a good deal easier.

260
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,503
If there's nothing more for the moment, sir,

261
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,254
I think I ought to be getting along
with my deliveries.

262
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,928
Yes, and if any of your customers are angry,
please put the blame on me.

263
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,630
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

264
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,340
I'll see you tomorrow at the exercise.

265
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:32,853
- Splendid fellow.
- Oh, yes, keen as mustard.

266
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,604
What is this exercise, anything special?

267
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,437
No, action in the event of a parachute landing.

268
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,689
You'd better report sick, in case I need you.

269
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,116
All right, I'll have a sprained wrist
or something.

270
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,195
If you've any general suggestions to make,
I'd like to hear them.

271
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,827
Well, most of your men could pass
for 100% British

272
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,284
-like the sergeant, couldn't they?
- All, except one. A radio technician.

273
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,870
Well, I suggest that some of them
should pay a visit to the local pub,

274
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,126
The Ring of Bells, tonight.
Look very odd if they didn't.

275
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,673
Right! Anything else?

276
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,591
Well, they should make themselves
useful in their billets.

277
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,668
So?

278
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,425
You know, minding the baby and keeping
an eye on the kettle, and so on.

279
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,847
Ah, I see.

280
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,565
What part of the world do you come from?

281
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,061
Manchester.

282
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,768
Eee, then we're neighbours.

283
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,645
I come from Stockport.

284
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,026
Good old Piccadilly of a Saturday night.

285
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,154
I said I come from Manchester, not London.

286
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,739
Well, I know you did,

287
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,163
but I mean Piccadilly in Manchester, silly.

288
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,702
Oh, of course, I was forgetting.
I left Manchester when I was a child.

289
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,753
Oh, I see.

290
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,585
Well, that's done anyhow.

291
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,917
You carry those in, will you?

292
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,503
I'll take these. Come on.

293
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,599
There we are. Put those on the dresser.

294
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,264
Now come and sit down
and make yourself comfy.

295
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,900
Seven days' leave isn't much, is it?

296
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,073
No, it's all we chaps get.

297
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,362
I know.

298
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,239
But have I been waiting for it.

299
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,282
Dear Tom. Dear, dear...

300
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,749
It's like old times to hear
Bill Purvis's shotgun again.

301
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,500
He gave me a rabbit yesterday.

302
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,332
Black market?

303
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,586
Wedding present.

304
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,976
That must be Joe Garbett
coming to have a look.

305
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,223
That's torn it.

306
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,181
If we budge, he'll hear us and if we don't,
he's sure to come and catch us.

307
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,312
Not if I knows anything.
Now you stay where you are.

308
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,563
And 'ang on to Betty.

309
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,770
When I whistle for 'er ten times, let her go.

310
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,150
- Then you nip off home, see.
- Okay. What about tomorrow night?

311
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,449
Eleven o'clock. Same place.

312
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,907
Betty?

313
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,829
- Still, Betty. Still.
- Betty!

314
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,369
Where are you, lass?

315
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,037
Five...

316
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,373
Not yet, Betty.

317
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,256
Six...

318
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,682
- Oh, good evening, Mr Garbett.
- Evening, Bill.

319
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,426
That dog of mine run off again,

320
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,762
so I just come in to have a look for 'er.

321
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,017
Beth'!

322
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,809
I heard a couple of shots up this way
a moment or two ago.

323
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,611
- Didn't happen to have a gun with you?
- A gun, ha!

324
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,985
When I'm just out looking for me dog.

325
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,740
That dog of yours doesn't seem
to be around here at all.

326
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,534
Nine.

327
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,205
Ten. Phew!

328
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,208
Trespassing in Manor Wood

329
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,331
and no reasonable excuse.

330
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,543
<i>Psst.</i>

331
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,807
Where you been, you wicked lass?

332
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,351
Gettin' your master into trouble
with the constable.

333
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,678
Very nearly.

334
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,605
Well, I must be getting along to me supper,
got a nice stewed rabbit.

335
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,149
- Rabbit?
- Found on the Upton Road.

336
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,942
Got run over, I suppose.

337
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,645
- Goodnight, Mr Garbett.
- Goodnight, Bill.

338
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,980
Come on, Betty.

339
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,242
- Evening.
- Good evening.

340
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,327
What will you have?

341
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,128
- Bitter.
- Light ale.

342
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,797
- Same.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,178
Here you are, Jim.

344
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,255
- Ah, thank you.
- Evening, ma'am.

345
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,512
- Oh, good evening.
- Will you take a drop of something?

346
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,343
Well, that's very kind of you, I'm sure.

347
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,894
I wouldn't say no to a small port.

348
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,347
MAN: Seventy-two.

349
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,892
Billets nice and comfortable, I hope?

350
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,689
Billets? Oh, yeah.

351
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,566
Fred was saying quite home from home,
weren't you, Fred?

352
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,023
- That's right.
- Bit of excitement for us.

353
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,575
We never had so many foreigners
in the village before.

354
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,403
- Foreigners?
- Well, strangers to these parts, like.

355
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,363
We always call 'em foreigners round this way.

356
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,823
That'll be two and six, please, sir.

357
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,658
- Two beers, Jim.
- Righto, Pat.

358
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,118
Thank you, sir.

359
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,039
Your very good health and down with Hitler.

360
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,802
Goodness, how dreadful,
I've only just realised.

361
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,515
Realised what?

362
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,433
It was seeing you again made me remember.

363
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,603
I never took it up to the manor house after all.

364
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,227
- The telegram. Oh!
- You had it at the hall.

365
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,559
I must have left it there then.
I'd better pop round and see if I can find it.

366
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,644
There's a guard on the door.
He won't let you pass.

367
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,690
Be a good Samaritan and come with me,
won't you?

368
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,490
Come on, be a dear.

369
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,873
- Another game?
- No thanks, I've had enough.

370
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:46,751
- How much do we owe?

371
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,833
- Let's see now, in English money that's...
- Pay attention!

372
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,337
This lady's lost a telegram.

373
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,138
Anyone seen such a thing?

374
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,090
A telegram? Has it been opened?

375
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,222
It wasn't in an envelope, just the form.

376
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,429
It was addressed "Fraser" and signed "Maud."

377
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,981
I can't think what on earth I could have...
Why, I believe that's it.

378
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,852
It is, thank goodness for that.

379
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,936
We've been scoring on the back of it,
I'm afraid.

380
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,864
Never mind, I've found it,
that's the main thing.

381
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,193
Oh, but what about your game?
You'll need it for the score.

382
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,448
We'd just finished.

383
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,995
Oh, that's all right then.

384
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,873
Bit of a makeshift in here.

385
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,992
Not very comfy for you, is it?

386
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,665
No.

387
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,922
Oh, well, I'll be getting along then.

388
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,305
I haven't had this done for me
since I was about six.

389
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,131
- There you are.
- Thank you so much.

390
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,094
If you ask me,
I think he sprained his wrist on purpose.

391
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,228
When I think of those Germans
gorging themselves on French wines,

392
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,227
it makes me quite furious.

393
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,183
I'm afraid I haven't much sympathy
for the French.

394
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,985
That's one of the many points
we disagree about, isn't it, Nora?

395
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,860
Well, they let us down so abominably.
I think they deserve to suffer for it.

396
00:21:54,939 --> 00:22:00,321
My dear, I don't think anybody's so bad
that they deserve to live under Nazi rule.

397
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,452
Talking about France,
were you over there before Dunkirk?

398
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,159
Up to our necks in it, weren't we, Maxwell?

399
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,122
Yes, spent most of our time blowing up
bridges the French had forgotten to attend to.

400
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,878
- Absentminded fellows, the French.
- VICAR: You mean fifth column?

401
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,005
That must have been
the most unpleasant thing of all,

402
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,178
never knowing
who was working for the enemy.

403
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,006
I can't understand what a fifth columnist
hopes to gain, in the long run.

404
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,136
Power, I suppose.

405
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,684
Well, that's one thing
we haven't got to worry about.

406
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,228
No one can tell me
there's a potential fifth column in England.

407
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,352
Oh, I'm not so sure, Mrs Fraser,
you're just the type.

408
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,433
You love exercising power, now.
Now, you admit it.

409
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,398
There's something in that.

410
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,946
You'd better keep an eye on me
when the invasion comes.

411
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,696
This famous invasion that the papers
keep trying to scare us about.

412
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,618
You don't think it's a genuine possibility?

413
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,786
Personally, no.
The boche is devilishly good on propaganda.

414
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,085
They start the invasion rumours
in order to make us keep millions of men

415
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,661
tied up here in Britain.

416
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,288
Which is why we have the luck
to be sitting here

417
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,873
enjoying your excellent dinner, Mrs Fraser.

418
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,460
Well, excellent or otherwise,
I'm afraid that's all there is of it.

419
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,264
Oh, Mrs Fraser, it arrived this morning.

420
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,689
You've every right to be angry.

421
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,313
But it's only about your cousin
coming to tea tomorrow.

422
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,191
My clear Mrs Collins,
what are you talking about?

423
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,069
- A telegram. I've got it in here somewhere.
- Come inside.

424
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,657
That's me all over, what with the sergeant
calling for the keys, and all...

425
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,070
Coffee in ten minutes, Bridget.

426
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:28,124
I'm ever so sorry about the envelope,
but I've run right out.

427
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,917
I must remember to order some more.
There isn't any answer, is there?

428
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,495
No, there's no answer.

429
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,797
Well, I'll run along, then.
I haven't had me supper yet.

430
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,169
What are all those figures?

431
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,798
Oh, it's the soldiers. I left it at the hall.

432
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,426
They've been using it for their cards,
to score on.

433
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,008
Yes, but why should they form their figures
in the continental way?

434
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,764
The continental way?

435
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,436
Yes, the seven, for example.

436
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,354
They've put a stroke
across the middle of it. Look!

437
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:55,272
There you are,
and there's one of those elongated fives.

438
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,857
What an extraordinary thing.

439
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,440
I don't see anything extraordinary about it.

440
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,446
It's probably a Czech or a Pole.
There are lots of them here.

441
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,277
Yes, but would they be
in the Royal Engineers?

442
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,738
Goodness, makes you think.

443
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,787
Well, I refuse to see anything sinister
in an elongated five!

444
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,584
I don't agree with you.

445
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,082
You never do, my dear.

446
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,498
What was the man like?
The one who was scoring?

447
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,255
- Oh, seemed a bit slow in the uptake.
- How do you mean?

448
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,803
Well, didn't seem to grasp
what I was getting at.

449
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,425
Did he say anything to you?

450
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,884
He only said "No" when I asked them
if they found the place quite comfy.

451
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,385
"No," just like that?

452
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,641
Manners, I thought to meself at the time.

453
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,223
Then he might have been a German,
for all you could tell.

454
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,686
I see, so you think there's a German spy
among Major Hammond's men.

455
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,189
A spy who can't understand English?

456
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,649
No. No, that's absurd, of course.

457
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,953
Perhaps they're all German spies,
carefully disguised <i>as</i> Royal Engineers.

458
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,405
Well, I don' t know what to think.

459
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,161
The one that went for young George
this morning,

460
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,743
I told him to his face
he was behaving like a German.

461
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,203
Now, listen, Mrs Collins,

462
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:59,506
you remember that scarecrow in my field
signalling to the Germans?

463
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,210
Made a proper laughingstock of meself,
didn't I?

464
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,636
- You certainly did.
- Yes, but this is quite different.

465
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,510
And quite as ridiculous.

466
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,309
Well, once bit, twice shy. I'll be trotting along.

467
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,264
We'll let sleeping dogs lie,
If you get my meaning.

468
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,598
We will.

469
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,980
Well, I think we ought to tell Oliver Wilsford
about it at least.

470
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,484
Please yourself, my dear.

471
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,903
Of course,
if you want to appear a fool in his eyes.

472
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,323
That was certainly a good one, Wilsford.

473
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,793
VICAR: What do you think, Nora?

474
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,504
Mr Maxwell was up at Cambridge with John.

475
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,960
He stroked the Jesus boat
the year they bumped Emma.

476
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,887
Nora. The radio.

477
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,595
- Coffee, everyone?
- VICAR: Thank you.

478
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,517
JUNG: We drove through Cambridge
on our way here, sir.

479
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,220
- MRS FRASER: Sugar, Vicar?
- If you please.

480
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,852
JUNG: Honestly,
you'd hardly recognise the place.

481
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,898
Nothing but civil servants and the RAF.

482
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,150
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

483
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,651
- Would you mind stirring it for me?
- Certainly.

484
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,322
<i>(THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND)</i>

485
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,215
Come on, Ted.

486
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,215
Hey, take a squint at Dad.

487
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,302
Done up like a dog's dinner.

488
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,758
Well, cheerio, Dad.

489
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,353
They'll take him for the bridegroom,
not the best man.

490
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,808
- Ah, good morning, Mrs Owen.
- Oh. Good morning.

491
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,689
- Bob!
- Coming.

492
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,197
- They're here.
- Hello, boys.

493
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,157
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Bye-bye, Bob.

494
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,280
Be back about four.

495
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,203
Oh, Bob, wait a minute.
You're forgetting your sandwiches.

496
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,368
Oh, thank you.

497
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,745
What's your missus given you,
enough for the whole platoon?

498
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,077
Morning.

499
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,086
- Goodbye.
- BOB: Good luck, Tom.

500
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,918
That's a fine way to spend
your wedding morning, isn't it?

501
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,627
The governor's upstairs dressing himself up
like a Christmas tree.

502
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,507
These blinkin' collars.

503
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,635
I've a mind to put on me uniform
and come with you chaps after all.

504
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,466
- I'll come up and help you fix it.
- Come on.

505
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,178
- All the best.
- Cheerio. Save us a bit of cake, Tom.

506
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,643
- Ah, there you are, miss.
- What is it, George? I'm busy.

507
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,399
His nibs says I've got to have
a clean surplice for the wedding.

508
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,355
His nibs. George.

509
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,032
Well, your old man then.

510
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,697
But you had a clean surplice only last week.

511
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,155
I know, miss, but them birds' eggs
in my pocket, didn't half make a mess.

512
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,865
You'll have to wait
until I've done the bedrooms.

513
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,955
I'll be late, I will.

514
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,630
- Whose room is this then?
- Major Hammond's.

515
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,332
Cor, you got 'im?

516
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,425
Posh pyjamas.

517
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:58,477
- George. Don't meddle. What are you doing?
- Nothing, miss.

518
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,273
Leave that alone and don't meddle.

519
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,605
Hmm, funny sort of way to spell chocolate.

520
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,982
C-H-O-K-O-L-A-D-E.

521
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,859
And what does "Wien" mean?

522
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,194
Chokolade is the German for chocolate.

523
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,208
And Wien is the German for Vienna.

524
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,831
Perhaps he snitched it from a Jerry
what crashed.

525
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,296
Don't meddle, blimey!

526
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,389
-It's extraordinary, most extraordinary.
- I felt I had to tell you at once.

527
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,145
- Well, I'm very glad you did.
- You see, it's not only this chocolate.

528
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,228
There was the writing on the telegram
and all that Mrs Collins was saying.

529
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,529
It's more than evidence, Nora. It's proof.

530
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,732
I'll get on to Zone Headquarters at once.

531
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,747
Wait a minute, what a fool I am.

532
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,659
That D-46 that came in
from the sub-area the other day.

533
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,245
- Yes?
- Well, they're tightening up on security.

534
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,581
Staging a series of tests all over the country.

535
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,924
- This must be one of them.
- Tests?

536
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,171
Yes, you remember that thing in the paper

537
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,345
about those two men
who wandered all round Gerrards Cross,

538
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,719
acting in a peculiar manner?
They turned out to be Security Police.

539
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,848
But surely they wouldn't send lorry loads of
Security Police to a tiny little village like this?

540
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,929
Oh, no, presumably Hammond's doing
a routine job

541
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,686
and simply has some of these security men
attached to him.

542
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,813
However, we can soon check up.

543
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,690
Do sit down, won't you?

544
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,986
I must say, I should hate to think that

545
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,815
we were sharing our dinner last night
with a couple of Nazis.

546
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,366
Hello? Hello?

547
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,198
I imagine he's doing
a sort of <i>mass</i> observation.

548
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,201
Taking a cross-section
of every type of the community

549
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,748
from the big cities downwards.

550
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,075
Hello? Hello?

551
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,622
Really, Mrs Collins gets worse every day.
Never mind, I'll try again later.

552
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,707
You did give me rather a shock, Nora.

553
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,009
Do you know, I could almost cry with relief.

554
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:58,555
I may be wrong, of course, but my explanation
does sound rather more feasible, doesn't it?

555
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,220
It's close on eleven. You, uh...

556
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,053
You can't go to the wedding
without a flower, can you?

557
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,388
Oh, thank you.

558
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,021
Father'll wonder what on earth,
and there's George waiting for his surplice.

559
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,188
I'm afraid I've made an awful fool of myself
rushing to you in a panic like this.

560
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,649
Nonsense, Nora.
You've been a very good citizen.

561
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:17,904
Thank you, Oliver.

562
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,031
As for Mrs Fraser,
she ought to be ashamed of herself.

563
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,654
- Good morning, Miss Nora.
- Good morning, Mrs Carter.

564
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,832
I'll be across the church
as soon as I've done this call.

565
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,998
Goodbye.

566
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,721
Ring Post One.

567
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,220
Report cipher radio message
from White Cottage.

568
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,346
Warning for Plan B.

569
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,678
- Lieutenant Jung.
- A message for you, sir.

570
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,059
Yes? Yes. Right.

571
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,776
Herr Kommandant, message from Wilsford.
Warning for Plan B.

572
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,657
Plan B. Each man will deal with his own billet.

573
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,575
If persuasion fails, use force.

574
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,200
All the villagers to be assembled
in the churchyard by 1200 hours.

575
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,655
- Right, sir.
- Plan B.

576
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,167
Plan B.

577
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,670
Plan B.

578
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,012
Come along with me.
Major Hammond's orders.

579
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,839
Go along with you? Where to?

580
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,926
- The church.
- We can't do that, son, we're chapel.

581
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,557
- Never goes inside church.
- State of national emergency.

582
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,309
Major Hammond's
addressing the whole village.

583
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,608
Addressing the whole village? What about?

584
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,811
Don't know. Orders. Come along.

585
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,570
But I tell you I can't.

586
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,865
I've just put the joint in,
besides, there's baby.

587
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,576
- Come on.
- How dare you!

588
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,777
I'll report you.

589
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,078
I said, hurry.

590
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,117
There, there, lovey, don't cry.
Mummy's all right.

591
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,416
We're going along with the soldier.

592
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,795
You two. Get in the back.

593
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,082
- What?
- Get in.

594
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,544
- You know how to drive?
- Yes.

595
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,718
Then get in.

596
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,593
Why the warning for Plan B?
What went wrong?

597
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,095
Well, you did, among other things.
Look at this.

598
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,722
Found in your haversack.

599
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,893
Well?

600
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,765
- Chokolade... Wien.
- Who found it?

601
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,982
Nora Ashton.

602
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,228
Naturally, in her distress, she turned to me,
which only goes to show...

603
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,439
- You stopped her reporting it?
- Well, obviously.

604
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,616
I'm supposed to be trying to contact
Zone Headquarters,

605
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,366
which reminds me, I'd better stage
a little attempt in support of that.

606
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,035
There's no need. We must get to the church.

607
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,459
All the same, your plan does rather depend
on my cooperation, doesn't it'?

608
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,333
- Might be advisable to...
- You take orders from me!

609
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,834
Oh, quite.

610
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,882
Always remembering, my dear fellow,

611
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,255
that I should keep up appearances
with the villagers.

612
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,712
Very well, hurry!

613
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,262
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Thank you.

614
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,558
Oh, by the way, your men will have
covered the exchange by this time, I take it?

615
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,180
- Of course.
- Hello!

616
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,183
Hello? Oh, Daisy. Look, this is urgent.

617
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,517
Get me Zone Headquarters, Blackford 228,
and make it priority.

618
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,272
Yes, sir.

619
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,854
Don't forget. Say there is a breakdown.

620
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,066
- It isn't true.
- Do as I say.

621
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:49,286
Sorry, Mr Wilsford, there's been a breakdown.

622
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,864
And obey orders in future.

623
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,207
Now I'm at your disposal.

624
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,630
No, after you. Oh, prisoners first, I suppose.

625
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,216
Portrait of an English gentleman,
yielding reluctantly to superior force. Oh!

626
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,501
Let us pray.

627
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:55,014
Oh, God, who art the author of peace
and lover of concord,

628
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,851
in knowledge of whom
standeth our eternal life,

629
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,525
whose service is perfect freedom,

630
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:08,778
defend us, thine humble servants
in all assaults of our enemies,

631
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,361
that we, surely trusting in Thy defence,

632
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:16,032
may not fear the power of any adversaries.

633
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,911
- Silence!
- Through the might

634
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,039
of Jesus Christ, our Lord.

635
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,336
Amen.

636
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,303
Excuse me, sir, don't you know
there's a service on?

637
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,721
Get back to your places.

638
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:36,552
Major Hammond, what is the meaning
of this monstrous interruption?

639
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,020
Get back to your places.

640
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,224
Reiber! Hoffman!

641
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,861
Muller!

642
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,816
Over there. Over there!

643
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,484
Major Hammond!

644
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,320
I am Kommandant Ortler
of the Fifth Parachute Regiment.

645
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,202
- Parachute?
- We are Germans, my men and I.

646
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,162
But, surely...

647
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,164
Jung, bring in the others.

648
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,932
They stopped me before I could telephone.

649
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:27,110
We have work to do here
and we intend to do it without interference.

650
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:32,441
Obey my orders and you will not be harmed.

651
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,242
Any person who attempts to escape

652
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:38,322
or communicate with the outside world
will be shot.

653
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,206
Is that clear?

654
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,455
You ask me to bow down
before the forces of evil,

655
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,546
-here in this House of God?
- I ask nothing.

656
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,958
I give you my orders.

657
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,635
I am a minister of the Christian faith.

658
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:58,517
I'll take no orders from those who are
the enemies and oppressors of mankind.

659
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,480
Darling, don't worry, it's all right,
don't be frightened.

660
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,189
Quiet, you fools!

661
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,323
Get back to your places, do you hear?

662
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,674
Listen.

663
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,429
What's up, Ted?

664
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,849
Bramley Church bell. Didn't you hear it?

665
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,015
- Get away with you.
- Oh, the Corporal is hearing things.

666
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,846
Oh, pack it up, fellows.

667
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,604
It rang twice. See if it goes again.

668
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,935
Here, get down, you two.

669
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,362
Ted thought he could hear
the church bell ring, sir, over at Bramley.

670
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,111
No, he couldn't have. That's the signal
enemy parachutists have landed.

671
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,237
I know that, sir.

672
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,694
We're only doing an exercise,
not a full dress rehearsal.

673
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,994
Here, take cover properly.

674
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,077
I could've sworn I heard it.

675
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,878
Any further attempt will be as futile.

676
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,421
Any further offender will forfeit
more than his own life,

677
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,219
every member of his family will be shot.

678
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,640
I give you three minutes
to come to your senses.

679
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,891
You will choose a spokesman
and receive my instructions through him.

680
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,191
Now, you boys, go back to your places
and put the candles out.

681
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,320
Yes, sir.

682
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,946
- Don't, don't.
- Wait a minute, son.

683
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,747
- If only I could get to my switchboard.
- Come with me. I must go to Nora.

684
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,243
The Home Guard,
what'll happen when they come back?

685
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,166
You can't fight Tommy guns
with bare fists.

686
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,043
We're not going to stick here
and let them walk over us.

687
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,839
- Better dead.
- That's right, Joe.

688
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,509
There's more of us than there are of them,
some of us might get through.

689
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,552
Well, we've got to decide something.

690
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,097
I'm game to try anything.

691
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,264
- Me, too.
- Same here.

692
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,684
- I'd like to lay me hands on them.
- The bell.

693
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,059
- Let me ring it.
- No, no, no. It would be mad.

694
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,150
- We're helpless.
-It's all my fault.

695
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,354
I should have listened to them last night.

696
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,899
I feel so stupid, so useless.

697
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,908
We've only got a minute.

698
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,072
Now, listen, everybody, it's no good making
martyrs of ourselves, that won't help us at all.

699
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,327
What's the alternative,
to wait for a miracle to happen?

700
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,751
No, not a miracle, a chance.
A sporting chance.

701
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,043
That's right. Do exactly what he tells us.

702
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,087
- Make him think we've knuckled under.
- I see.

703
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,455
I might get through to Upton.

704
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,042
No, no, it's no good doing things
on our own, individually.

705
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,174
They'd be bound to fail and just
put these brutes on their guard.

706
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,551
- We've got to plan the thing properly.
- Mr Wilsford's right, Jim.

707
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,758
- Yes, maybe he is.
-If only I could work something out.

708
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,056
- Some sort of scheme.
- MAN: He's coming back.

709
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,229
- Who's going to speak for us?
- Mr Wilsford.

710
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,806
- I second that.
- Yes, yes...

711
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,062
Well, somebody must, I suppose.

712
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,024
- Well?
- We agree to obey your orders

713
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,858
provided you keep to your side of the bargain,
no harm to anyone.

714
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,409
Very good. I shall give you your instructions.

715
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,701
Outside.

716
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,411
You will be held responsible for order here.

717
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:21,257
Convenient, that gesture of the vicar's.
Gave them an object lesson.

718
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,714
- At any rate, I think I've convinced them that...
- I want some details.

719
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,892
This list of yours.
A man named Purvis is missing.

720
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,807
Oh, yes, Bill Purvis. He'll be out poaching.

721
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,730
He might easily be away all day and night.

722
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,062
And the Home Guard?

723
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,189
Oh, there are four of them, armed with rifles.

724
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,986
They'll be back some time this afternoon.

725
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,697
Now, Sunday. No trades people, I presume?

726
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,899
There's the postman.

727
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,826
He makes a collection at Mrs Collins
at five o'clock.

728
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,202
Then there's the boy with the Sunday papers
from Upton. He goes to nearly everyone.

729
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,281
Very well.

730
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,788
Conditions in the village must appear normal.

731
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,835
Cyclists and hikers will be diverted.

732
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,585
People will return to their home
until 8:00 p.m.

733
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,416
Well, if they do, I can't guarantee they won't...

734
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,376
You will not be required to.

735
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,753
My men will attend to that.

736
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,678
Then the children,
they might blurt out anything.

737
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,801
Yes, that's a point.

738
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,178
Make Mrs Fraser responsible for them.

739
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,136
One of the maids can help.
Send them all up to the manor.

740
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,598
The Vicar's daughter must go, too.
She might become hysterical.

741
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,650
What time does this newspaper boy arrive?

742
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,568
Between one and two.

743
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,028
- What'll mum say?
- You go with him.

744
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,909
And stop your crying.

745
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,914
Repeat your instructions.

746
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,706
If any calls come from outside,

747
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,836
I'm to say

748
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,841
the number's engaged
or the line's out of order.

749
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,266
- Afternoon, Mrs Collins.
- Afternoon, Johnnie.

750
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,552
What's the matter with your Daisy today?

751
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,855
Looks very sorry for herself.
Been in the wars, has she'?

752
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,352
Ask no questions, you'll be told no lies.

753
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,563
Oh, thank you, Mrs Collins.

754
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,457
You stay where you are!

755
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,880
Oh, afternoon. Where's all the others?

756
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,180
Busy kissing the bride?

757
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,304
SOLDIER: That's about it, I'll take this.

758
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,852
- Do I pay for it now?
- That's right. COD. like.

759
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,763
There's a shilling. Keep the change.

760
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,099
Thanks, give them all my best.

761
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,273
There's no point in letting ourselves starve.

762
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,410
There's just a chance, anyway.

763
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,705
Well, it's better than not trying anything.

764
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,219
Go on, Marlene, do your stuff.

765
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,888
The sweet's just coming.

766
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,357
More cider?

767
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,979
I'm glad you like it.

768
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,149
It's last year's brew.

769
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,156
It was a good year for apples, last year.

770
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,661
By the way,
when the boy comes with the papers,

771
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,208
we always send a few eggs to his mother.

772
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,500
She's an invalid.

773
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,126
You'd like us to do the same as usual,
wouldn't you?

774
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,338
Do you want to look inside the box?

775
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,508
Yes.

776
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,261
Plum tart. My speciality.

777
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,386
That'll be young Johnnie.

778
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,557
Sugar'? We've got plenty.

779
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,280
- Good afternoon, Johnnie.
- Afternoon, didn't expect to see you here.

780
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,982
Thought you'd be over at the wedding party.

781
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,614
Well, I had to give our billet his dinner.

782
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,121
There's the tuppence for the paper
and here's some more eggs for your mother.

783
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,698
They're a bit on the small side again.

784
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,625
- But Mum didn't...
- Oh, I know she didn't mind about that,

785
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,796
but they are nice eggs, all the same,
though I say they shouldn't...

786
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,623
Would you like tea or coffee?

787
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,923
Coffee.

788
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,842
Still, if the hens can't, they can't, can they?

789
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,796
And if they help to make your mother better,
that's all that matters, isn't it'?

790
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,883
Now, don't drop them on your way home,
will you'? There's a good boy. Bye-bye.

791
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,768
You know when that rick caught fire in Upton,

792
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,017
we could see the smoke
from the top of the hill.

793
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,600
Well, if I could sneak down to the farm
and start a bonfire,

794
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,685
the Upton A.F.S. would be sure
to come along to see what was up.

795
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,738
No, George, you don't get yourself shot
while you're in my charge.

796
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,985
What're we supposed to do then?

797
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,863
Sit and twiddle our thumbs
while the Jerries walk all over us?

798
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,535
There's plenty you can do.

799
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,079
Do you know what morale is?

800
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,872
Yeah, something what the Wops ain't got.

801
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,622
Well, I'm going to make you responsible
for keeping up the children's morale.

802
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,954
Sit down.

803
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,756
The little ones are frightened.

804
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,050
I want you to make it seem
a sort of game to them.

805
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,504
Give them a double ration
of sweets and leave it at that.

806
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,140
Still, you're the boss, anything you say.

807
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,092
Afternoon, miss.

808
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:24,397
Johnnie, listen, it's very important.
You've got to take a message to Mr Drew.

809
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,564
Yes?

810
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,566
Tell him we shall want six extra quartern
loaves tomorrow, if he can manage it.

811
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,613
Six extra quartern loaves, okay.

812
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,780
Afternoon.

813
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,534
If there was only something.
Something they hadn't thought of.

814
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,748
Perhaps there is. Perhaps there is.

815
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:04,601
# <i>Cherry ripe, cherry ripe
Ripe, ripe, I cry</i> #

816
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,227
Edward, let go of that, you little brute.

817
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,649
Edward!

818
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,856
Hey! Look out!

819
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,745
Oh, I'm so sorry. I do hope you're not hurt.

820
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,448
I'm okay, lady.
Here, give us a hand with this bike.

821
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,129
Look!

822
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,840
The Home Guard.

823
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,656
Identity card, please.

824
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,329
Heavens, I hope I've got it.

825
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,281
Edward! Edward, give me that bag.

826
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,870
I suppose it's manoeuvres,
I thought I heard shooting.

827
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,705
- That's right, madam.
- Ah, here it is.

828
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,542
Thank heavens I shan't be
taken prisoner after all.

829
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,878
You'll have to tell us where you're making for,
if you don't mind.

830
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,712
Bramley End. The manor house.

831
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,470
- The manor house. All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

832
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,109
And you see, the Hampshire senior
demonstrator sprained her ankle.

833
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,815
So they transferred me to Winchester.

834
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,744
In fact, I'm to give my first demonstration
there this evening. Vegetarian dishes.

835
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,913
Oh, thank you, Dolly, just how I like it.

836
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,287
My cousin gives cookery demonstrations
for the Ministry of Food.

837
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,414
- Oh, that must be very interesting.
- Fascinating.

838
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,836
It's amazing what you can do

839
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,539
with the most humdrum vegetables,
if you set your mind to it.

840
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,374
- Really?
- Which reminds me,

841
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,459
the other day,
when I was rummaging for salvage,

842
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,170
I came across an old book.

843
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,596
I must show you.

844
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:46,015
It's my grandmother's recipe book.

845
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:52,021
Poor dear, she went all through
the Siege of Paris, in 1870, you know.

846
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,564
Rationing wasn't in it.

847
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,891
Oh, here it is.

848
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,816
They were reduced to the most terrible straits.

849
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,650
And, of course, horse flesh was unobtainable
after the first few weeks.

850
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,111
Rats were quite a delicacy, apparently.

851
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,952
Look, elephant cutlets. Good heavens!

852
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,783
Oh, yes, they ate all the animals from the zoo.

853
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,041
Parrot pie. Roast leg of bear.

854
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:20,716
<i>Antelope steak.</i> Tiger <i>en casserole.</i>

855
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,089
Your grandmother must have been
a very courageous woman.

856
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,763
I believe hyena was too much for her, though.

857
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,265
She was ill for weeks afterwards.

858
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,469
Hyena? I can quite imagine
that was no laughing matter.

859
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:34,226
I wonder which is the best end
of neck of giraffe'?

860
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,479
Goodness, I must fly!
They've booked the hall for half past six.

861
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,812
Fascinating book.
I shall certainly refer to it in my lectures.

862
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,897
- Do borrow it then, won't you?
- Oh, may I?

863
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,573
I'll take the greatest care of it.

864
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,821
- Let me hold it for you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

865
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,699
Oh, don't bother to come and see me off.

866
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,405
By the bye, I do hope your side wins.

867
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,208
- My side?
- In the manoeuvres.

868
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,534
Oh, yes, of course.

869
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,165
Thank goodness Edward's asleep.

870
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,336
I'll put this in the back for you.

871
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,506
Thank you. Goodbye, Dolly, my dear.

872
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,295
Goodbye, dear.

873
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,388
Oh, this window, the handle's broken.
It's been rattling all the way here.

874
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,340
Now, what can I fix it with?

875
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,800
Oh, this will do.

876
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,770
It's a 1932 model, so you can't really blame it.

877
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,893
- Well, goodbye, Mr Maxwell.
- Goodbye.

878
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,974
So glad to see you again.

879
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,602
Goodbye, darling.

880
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,120
One can't be too careful, can one?

881
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:44,210
# <i>Parrot pie, parrot pie
Pie, pie, I cry</i>

882
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,880
Drat, that window.

883
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,807
# <i>Parrot pie, parrot pie
Pie, pie, I cry</i> #

884
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,347
I haven't much cooked, I'm afraid.

885
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,142
But I've got these leftover.

886
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,059
You Germans are partial to sausage,
aren't you'?

887
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,768
Help yourself, don't wait to be asked.

888
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,353
You're a sensible woman.

889
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,905
You'd do better for yourself
to accept the situation.

890
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:10,827
Well, it's been a very pleasant surprise, really.

891
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,903
After the way the papers
have been carrying on

892
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:16,207
about you Germans being fiends
in human form

893
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,705
and sticking babies on the ends of bayonets.

894
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,003
- Sugar?
- Mmm.

895
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,875
Babies on bayonets?

896
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,502
What would be the advantage?

897
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,129
That's just what I say.

898
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,176
Oh, you'll need the cruet.

899
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,048
You don't look at all that sort of man to me.

900
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,220
A regular family man, I should take you for.

901
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:41,140
I'm not married, but I have two fine sons

902
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,191
who will soon be old enough to fight.

903
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,988
You don't say?
Well, I'm broad-minded myself and, uh...

904
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,690
And accidents will happen.

905
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,694
Here. That silly pepper pot. I'll do it.

906
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,030
I never had any children myself.

907
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,701
Mr Collins blamed me for it and I blamed him.

908
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,456
And then he was taken.

909
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,503
So we never found out.

910
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,732
Hello, Upton.

911
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,492
Hello, Upton!

912
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,030
Are you there?

913
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,993
Are you there?

914
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,245
<i>Hello, Upton.</i>

915
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,327
"And what are you doing
for the war effort?" she said.

916
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,957
Well, the nerve!

917
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,586
That's old Mother Collins.
She can wait.

918
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,466
<i>Hello, Upton!</i>

919
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,380
- Are you there? Are you there? Hello!

920
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,517
Calls herself a lance bombardier, too.

921
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:06,271
Oh, well, better see what the old girl wants.

922
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,023
Hello?

923
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,609
Hello?

924
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,953
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

925
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,249
Is Mrs Collins in?

926
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,373
She's out. Can I help you?

927
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,295
It's the five o'clock collection.

928
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,375
Mrs Collins asked me to tell you
there isn't any mail today.

929
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,959
-Isn't any?
- None at all.

930
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,044
Oh, well, good day, then.

931
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,380
Good day.

932
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,809
- Frank Leslie.
- Here.

933
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,524
- John and Michael Farrar.
- Here.

934
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,023
- Billy Curtis.
- Here.

935
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,150
- Norman Williams.
- Yes.

936
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,573
- George Truscott.
- Here.

937
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,291
Everything will be all right, boys.

938
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,665
- Goodnight.
- BOYS: Goodnight, Mrs Fraser.

939
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,422
- Mrs Cobham.
- Here.

940
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,348
- John Underwood.
- Here.

941
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,885
- Mrs Underwood.
- Here.

942
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,353
- Oliver Wilsford.
- Here.

943
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,681
- Mrs Owen.
- Here.

944
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,605
Where's my husband?
Where's the Home Guard?

945
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,482
The Home Guard have been dealt with.

946
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,733
No!

947
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,033
Go on, Sergeant.

948
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,200
Jack Brown.

949
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,701
Jack Brown!

950
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,873
Here.

951
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,750
Silence!

952
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,085
- Phyllis Long.
- Here.

953
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,838
- Charles Sims.
- Here.

954
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,293
It isn't true, it can't be true.

955
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,718
I'm afraid it is, Mrs Owen.

956
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,467
- Mrs Bates.
- Here.

957
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,013
- James Sturry.
- Here.

958
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,682
- Mrs Sturry.
- Here.

959
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,475
- Thomas Sturry.
- Here.

960
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,598
Joseph Garbett.

961
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,348
- Joseph Garbett!
- That's me.

962
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,437
What do you mean "dealt with"?

963
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,735
You understand well enough.

964
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,817
- Mrs Rogers.
- Here.

965
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,781
- Mrs Barnes.
- Here.

966
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,946
- Walter Pavitt.
- Here.

967
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,110
439993! PW-
-Here.

968
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,196
-Ivy Dorking.
- Here.

969
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:25,660
What about the guards?

970
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,834
Well, they meet under the window,
go around the house,

971
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,331
meet on the other side.

972
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,581
- I'll have to time it okay, though.
- What do you do then?

973
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,588
Well, what I always do,
crawl down behind the tennis court

974
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,011
through the kitchen garden
and into the woods.

975
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,805
But suppose there's more Jerries about?
Then what?

976
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,177
Make a detour.

977
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,134
Bill Purvis, he learnt me all the dodges.

978
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,594
And bring the Home Guard back?

979
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,850
Gosh! Perhaps there'll be a battle at Bramley.

980
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,229
You betcha. And we won't half
give those blinkin' Jerries the works.

981
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,935
Put the light out, Frank.
I've got Mrs Fraser's torch.

982
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,371
Well, chaps.

983
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,454
- So long.
- So long.

984
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,489
Have you hit on a plan yet, Mr Wilson?

985
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,208
Yes, I've got something worked out.
Uh, Mrs Rogers, a cup of tea?

986
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,877
- But we must wait until...
- Wait while there's more killing?

987
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,875
- What's the use of that?
- Easy, Joe.

988
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,376
What about the bell, like the vicar tried?

989
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,960
No, no, no. They've removed the clapper,
I heard them giving the instructions.

990
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,713
Don't forget we're counting on you,
Mr Wilsford.

991
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,548
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

992
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,431
When Harry Drew comes around with
his van in the morning, that's our big chance.

993
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,012
No need to wait till the morning,
it's dark enough to try the other way.

994
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,597
- What's that, Charlie?
- Down the boiler room

995
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,603
there's a kind of hedge
where we had the coke shot in.

996
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,104
Gives onto the bushes on the north side.

997
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,527
It's plenty wide enough
for a man to get through.

998
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,105
Wait till the guards are round the other side
and then make a dash for it.

999
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,986
There may be guards all over the place,
for all you know.

1000
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:25,193
It's a chance, though. Come on, Charlie.

1001
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,243
No, Jim. I thought of it and I'm going to do it.

1002
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,242
- No, I'm fitter than you, Charlie.
- I'm the one that's going.

1003
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,493
- Now, listen, Joe...
- If you got caught,

1004
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,121
they'd not only shoot you,
but your missus and Tom in the bargain.

1005
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,077
I've got nothing to lose now.

1006
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,707
- Let's go.
- Oh, Garbett.

1007
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,963
You stay here. I'll take on this job.

1008
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,291
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm going.

1009
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:41,626
Well, then, we'll both go together.

1010
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,506
After all, two stand a better chance than one.

1011
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,553
You make for Upton, I'll make for Highfield.

1012
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,757
- One of us is bound to get through.
- Right you are, sir.

1013
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,386
This way, then.

1014
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,308
<i>Down them steps.</i>

1015
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,516
There's a sentry outside.

1016
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,226
Mind how you go.

1017
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:08,285
Listen, Garbett, we'll cut across
the churchyard to the copse,

1018
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,033
-then separate.
- Very good, sir.

1019
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,079
The gravestones will give us
some cover in case we're spotted.

1020
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,170
Guns?

1021
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,419
Thunder and raining hard.

1022
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,750
All the better.

1023
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:37,897
Good luck.

1024
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,676
Get down!

1025
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,963
Get down, a patrol!

1026
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,064
Who's there?

1027
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,863
Oh, it's you, sir.

1028
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,657
He tried to escape.

1029
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,620
Where's Kommandant Ortler?

1030
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,572
- I don't know, sir.
- Lieutenant Jung, then?

1031
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:36,747
At the manor house.

1032
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,791
Better put something heavy
on that coal hatch.

1033
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,710
Try and find a garden roller or something.

1034
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:42,003
Very good, sir. Come on.

1035
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,915
<i>That is the end of the English News</i>

1036
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,501
<i>on the European Service of the BBC.</i>

1037
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,302
<i>You're listening to AI Fitzroy
and his band</i>

1038
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:56,385
<i>playing to you from the Palace Hotel, London.</i>

1039
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,684
Nora, my dear.

1040
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,859
Gone.

1041
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,539
- How are you feeling now, my dear?
- I'm all right, thank you.

1042
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,421
I've just been listening to the news,

1043
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,214
there isn't anything.

1044
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,007
Anything important, I mean.

1045
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,378
They're playing dance music in town.

1046
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,972
I can't believe we're not in the middle of
the most terrible nightmare.

1047
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,053
The Germans in Bramley.

1048
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,396
It's hot.

1049
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,516
Where's Oliver?

1050
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,727
In the church with the others.

1051
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,520
What are you doing?

1052
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,901
Opening the window. We want some air.

1053
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,154
- Who's that?
- The sentry outside.

1054
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:56,407
Put the light out,
then we can draw the curtains.

1055
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,793
I can't hear a sound from the village.

1056
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,251
They talk about a woman's intuition.

1057
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,295
That's what warned you last night, Nora.

1058
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,255
Not the writing on the telegram.

1059
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:16,932
Intuition.

1060
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,227
I don't believe in intuition.

1061
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,812
If I did...

1062
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,436
There's something...

1063
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,188
What's the matter, Nora?

1064
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,690
I don't know.

1065
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,567
I don't know.

1066
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,450
There's someone coming up the drive.

1067
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,866
It's Oliver!

1068
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,498
- He must have got permission to...
- Permission?

1069
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:50,674
To walk about freely

1070
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,293
on his own?

1071
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,928
Well, what other explanation can there be?

1072
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:56,971
Sit down.

1073
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:00,392
I came to tell you that the policeman
found a way of escaping from the church.

1074
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,810
I escaped with him.

1075
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,020
He's now dead.

1076
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,979
I think these villagers could do
with a sharp lesson, don't you?

1077
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,485
They shall have a sharp lesson.

1078
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,622
Something that will put a stop to this
once and for all.

1079
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,840
You know these people.
What do you suggest?

1080
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,920
What about hostages?
That ought to keep them quiet.

1081
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,128
Hostages?

1082
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,338
Good.

1083
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,140
- I must say you've been invaluable to us.
- Thank you.

1084
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,763
Hadn't you better hurry?

1085
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,314
- You might get the Iron Cross for this.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

1086
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,910
You were warned.

1087
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,907
The warning was ignored.

1088
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,789
An attempt was made to escape.

1089
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,756
It failed.

1090
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,467
You all know the penalty.

1091
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:27,103
The family of any offender is to be shot.

1092
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,565
The man Garbett has a son.

1093
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,272
Where is he?

1094
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,898
He was in the Home Guard.

1095
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,729
So...

1096
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,488
I shall pick out five of the children.

1097
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,248
They will be shot tomorrow morning.

1098
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,666
They'll do it, too.

1099
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,039
Take us older ones.

1100
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:51,335
Do what you like with us.

1101
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,129
We can spare you a bullet.

1102
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,334
But that will not save the children.

1103
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,714
My baby!

1104
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,637
You are responsible for their deaths.

1105
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,018
Nothing will save them.

1106
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,776
Fancy a nipper at your age
making all that up out of your own 'ead.

1107
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,953
Every word of it's the truth, so 'elp me.

1108
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:29,454
Get away with you. And you gettin'
'alf drowned to come and tell me all that.

1109
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,663
Go on, there's nothing...

1110
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,001
Cor, you're right, sonny.

1111
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,145
How we goin' to get past them all
and through to Upton to Mr Drew?

1112
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:54,851
I'll tell you. I'll cause a diversion
and you make a run for it.

1113
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,685
You're spryer on your pins than what I am.

1114
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,395
Which way when I'm past these 'ere trees?

1115
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,731
Across the common
and use the gorse for cover,

1116
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,737
then across the stream,
through Bailey's Wood,

1117
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,409
and that'll bring you out
on the Upton Cross Roads.

1118
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,906
- S' easy.
- Yeah!

1119
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,989
And run with your hands on your knees
like I taught you.

1120
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,415
- Look here, Bill.
- Hello?

1121
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,333
How you going to cause this 'ere diversion?

1122
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,538
Oh, don't you mind, matey.
I can look after meself.

1123
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,667
So long, Bill.

1124
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:17,793
Come on, Betty.

1125
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,716
What's that?

1126
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,135
That's what I was waiting for.

1127
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,635
One of you down there,
go and light those candies.

1128
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,886
I can put the gas right if you want me to.

1129
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,934
-It's my job.
- What needs to be done?

1130
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,636
The plant down there wants seeing to,

1131
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,187
it's a petrol vapour system,

1132
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,731
needs tending every so often.

1133
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,183
Very well.

1134
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,436
- Paul, go with him.

1135
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,650
The lights'll go out suddenly.

1136
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,829
The rest of you, stay where you are.

1137
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,914
Keep way from those doors.

1138
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,291
Leave him to me, Dad.

1139
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,166
CORPORAL: Paul!

1140
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,584
Paul!

1141
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,885
Now keep still!

1142
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,130
All of you.

1143
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,802
Or I'll shoot.

1144
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,448
Go on, Tom, go on!

1145
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,034
That's right, lad, clout' im.

1146
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,663
That's that.

1147
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,704
Hold this.

1148
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,331
Charlie!

1149
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,170
Hello!

1150
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,626
Can you manage single-handed?

1151
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,177
I managed all right.

1152
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:35,801
- What about the lights?
- They'll be on in a minute.

1153
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,491
George!

1154
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,034
Grace, come down, will you?

1155
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,205
What's happened?

1156
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:07,412
It's young George Truscott.

1157
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,710
Why, he's soaking wet.

1158
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:12,505
He's hurt his leg.

1159
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,685
Lift him up, Grace.

1160
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,529
It's a bullet wound. Phone the doctor.

1161
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:37,654
Yes.

1162
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:43,494
Hello, Exchange?

1163
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,996
- Jerries.
- That's all right, son.

1164
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:51,039
- Jerries at Bramley.
- What, son?

1165
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,753
Grace, bring the brandy.

1166
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,676
The time. It must be almost light outside.

1167
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,716
We've got to save the children.

1168
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,924
First things first, we've got to save
those children, but there's something

1169
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,680
-even more important.
- I got this off him.

1170
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,887
- We must get through to Upton.
- You're wrong, Tom.

1171
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,767
- It's the children matter most.
- That's right.

1172
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:10,441
We've got our duty, not only to our kids
in Bramley, but to kids all over the country.

1173
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,736
Dad's right. We got to get in touch
with Harry Drew straight away.

1174
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,563
Warn the Army and the Home Guard.

1175
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,523
- We'll tackle the manor afterwards.
- Why not split up'?

1176
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,451
That's right, one to the manor
and the others make a dash for Upton.

1177
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,948
No, no, phoning's quickest.

1178
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,200
They're sure to have guards
on the switchboard.

1179
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,371
We'll take 'em by surprise.

1180
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,747
- We've got two Tommy guns and one revolver.
- Hold hard, son, once you start firing,

1181
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,954
-you have the whole lot boiling down on us.
- Yes, we got to do it quietly, if we can.

1182
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:34,632
I got the whole thing clear.
Dad and me will tackle Mrs Collins's.

1183
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,506
- Two more to make sure. Who's game?
- ALL: I am.

1184
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:41,556
Right, I'll take you, Mr Owen, you, Jack.
Charlie, you take charge of the other party.

1185
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,975
- Right.
- Mother, you go with Charlie.

1186
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,805
You, Peg, you and you, make your way
to the summer house and the manor garden.

1187
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,264
We'll join you as soon as
we've done the phoning.

1188
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:50,348
But the children, Jim?

1189
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,149
Any luck,
we'll have some more weapons by then.

1190
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:55,149
We'll do in the guard,
barricade ourselves in the manor house

1191
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,322
and hold off the Jerries
until the Army comes along.

1192
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,649
But the rest of us, Mr Sturry.
Can't we do something?

1193
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,736
You'd best stay here.
When we've gone, barricade the doors.

1194
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,823
- There'll be a couple of sentries outside.
- We'll have to settle them first.

1195
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,373
Jack and you take the Tommy guns.

1196
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:09,416
Don't use 'em unless you've got to.

1197
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,245
You wait behind the door
till we tell you it's clear.

1198
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:16,837
See you later.

1199
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,759
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1200
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,578
- We got them.
- Good. Good.

1201
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:40,417
Here, you get the women to the manor,
I'll keep this.

1202
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,467
We'll tackle the shop from the back.

1203
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,185
Steady. There's a machine-gun post
down the lane.

1204
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,685
- They won't expect trouble from the village.
- Let's make a dash for it.

1205
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,197
It's locked.

1206
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:07,076
- What about the kitchen?
- Yes. You stay there.

1207
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,323
Okay-

1208
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,412
Right.

1209
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:27,634
Where's the coffee?

1210
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,221
The old woman's coffee, where is it?

1211
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,474
She never takes... Took coffee, I don't think.

1212
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:36,146
Get some from the shop.

1213
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,381
You stay here and keep your eyes skinned.

1214
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,171
Come on, Dad.

1215
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,604
Get behind there.

1216
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,210
TOM: Are there any more of them?

1217
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:46,584
Daisy, pull yourself together.

1218
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,385
- Are there any more of them?
- No.

1219
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:55,185
Daisy, the phone.
We must get through to Upton.

1220
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,011
Yes.

1221
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,770
Get Harry Drew, quick <i>as</i> you can.

1222
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,740
- Dad, get the other two in.
- Okay.

1223
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:13,285
Hello? Hello, Upton 16, please, it's urgent.

1224
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:18,578
Thank you. Number's engaged.

1225
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,159
Here, let me talk to them.

1226
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,041
Hello.

1227
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:25,999
What's that?

1228
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,383
I can't cut him off, he's talking to the Army.

1229
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,803
Yes, sir, we're mustering our men now.

1230
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,676
In about 10 minutes, sir.

1231
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,220
Rendezvous Three Mile Cross? Right, sir.

1232
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,523
I'll answer it.

1233
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,522
Hello? I'm sorry.

1234
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,445
But it's a priority call, madam,
from Bramley End.

1235
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,151
Here, let me answer it.

1236
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,445
Hello, Drew here. Tom. Are you all right?

1237
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,956
- Yes, we know about that, the kid told us.
- Right.

1238
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,373
We're coming along as fast as we can,
Home Guards and the regulars.

1239
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,498
Okay, Harry.

1240
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,954
They're coming.

1241
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,131
- Dad, they're coming.
- Good!

1242
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,550
He says carry on with the plan
and keep the phone working.

1243
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,094
Daisy, are you game
to stand by the switchboard?

1244
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,297
- Yes, Mr Tom.
- That's a girl.

1245
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,889
- They're coming.
- You stick here with this.

1246
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,767
Dad and me will take the Tommy guns
and try to work our way up to the manor.

1247
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,564
I'll go upstairs and get Jack's.

1248
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,642
- The Germans.
- Where?

1249
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,148
- Coming along past the church.
- Let's go up.

1250
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:33,775
Relief going up to the machine-gun post.

1251
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,283
That means
the others'll be coming back soon.

1252
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,740
We can't risk going that way again.

1253
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,121
Jack, you keep that rifle.
We'll need the Tommy gun.

1254
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,292
Good.

1255
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,912
- Good luck, boys.
- Thanks.

1256
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,798
Keep a good look out, Jack.

1257
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:53,378
- Up the track by Joe Garbett's.
- Yes, and round by the back gardens.

1258
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,147
- That's done it.
- Let's go through the house.

1259
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,314
- It's no good, it's locked.
- Let's try Wilsford's.

1260
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,039
Tom.

1261
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,709
- Mr Wilsford.
- Hmm? What? What is it? Who is it?

1262
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,790
They didn't get you, then?

1263
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,589
No, I must have nine lives.

1264
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:38,548
They got poor Garbett.
They landed me a swipe on the head,

1265
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:41,225
and I managed to crawl back here
and passed out.

1266
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,554
- We must get through to the manor.
- Do you feel all right to go with us?

1267
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:47,857
- Yes, I'm all right. I'll come...
- Here you are, Mr Wilsford, lean on me.

1268
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:49,149
Thanks.

1269
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,769
- But, you two, what on earth...
- Oh, we managed to break out.

1270
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,149
The main lot of Jerries don't know yet.

1271
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,981
We're gonna try and hold the manor
till the troops get here.

1272
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,112
- What, you got through to them then, eh?
- Yes.

1273
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,581
13 Platoon will attack the enemy
in the windmill area,

1274
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,754
and 14 in and around the village.

1275
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,081
And my men to be divided
between the two platoons?

1276
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,883
Yes, you and seven men
come with me to the village,

1277
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:17,508
and your sergeant and the remainder
to the windmill.

1278
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,008
Get ready to move at once.

1279
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,431
Right, sir.

1280
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,849
Right, take 13 Platoon off at once

1281
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,723
and assemble in the woods
north of the windmill.

1282
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:27,806
You'd best attack from that direction.
It affords the best cover.

1283
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,890
- I'll leave the details to you.
- Right.

1284
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,193
- Get going straight away.
- Very good, sir.

1285
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,066
- And good luck, John.
- Thank you, sir.

1286
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:37,258
We got through to Harry Drew.
He's on his way and the Regulars, too.

1287
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,085
- Mr Wilsford, I thought...
- I'll explain about that later.

1288
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,340
How many guards they got there, Charlie?

1289
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,841
Two lots of two, as far as I could make out.

1290
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,719
Well, we better sneak round the back.
You better not come, sir, with that arm.

1291
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,641
- I'll come with you.
- What about us? Can't we do something?

1292
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,516
- No, you stay here with Mr Wilsford.
- We'll wait for a signal from you.

1293
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,017
- Right. You ready?
- Yes.

1294
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:54,562
Eat up your porridge, Michael.
You mustn't waste food in wartime.

1295
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:55,688
Yes, Mrs Fraser.

1296
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,020
- Mrs Fraser?
- Yes?

1297
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:59,696
- Do you think George has got to Upton yet?
- I've no idea.

1298
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,900
You boys were very naughty to let him go.

1299
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,155
He might have hurt himself.

1300
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,453
You mean he might have got shot by a Jerry.

1301
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,623
He was a mean beast not to take me with him.

1302
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,041
Why? You'd be no use.

1303
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,210
- Bet you I would.
- Bet you you wouldn't.

1304
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,583
Be quiet, Audrey.

1305
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,340
Stay where you are, children.

1306
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:23,675
Tom Sturry! Keep away from the window.

1307
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,385
You stay with the children, Nora.

1308
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:28,058
Come on, children, let's get back.

1309
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,419
- Where's Dad?
- He stopped one, I'm afraid.

1310
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,966
Well, you collect the others.

1311
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,008
Come on, quickly.

1312
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:11,593
- Does it hurt bad?
- A kind of shooting pain.

1313
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:14,476
- We'll get your coat off.
- No, not my arm. I can't feel that. It's my ankle.

1314
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,478
- Charlie!
- I twisted it falling.

1315
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,685
Give me a hand, will you?
We'll get him up to the house.

1316
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,479
Now, you people get inside the house.

1317
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,656
I'm going to collect the guns
and ammunition from the bodies.

1318
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,528
- We'll help, won't we, Ivy?
- Not 'arf.

1319
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,531
All right, tackle that side. You two, go in.

1320
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:35,875
We got through to Upton.

1321
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,170
- Help's coming.
- Thank goodness! Your arm...

1322
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:40,088
Never mind my arm, ma'am,
it's my blinking ankle.

1323
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,416
In the drawing room, there's a sofa.

1324
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,592
No. We're going to barricade
the downstairs rooms.

1325
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,010
- Take him up, will you?
- Bridget!

1326
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,678
- Tom, I'll take this upstairs.
- That's right.

1327
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,300
Sorry, ma'am,
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a heavyweight.

1328
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,803
Don't worry, so am I. Come along.

1329
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,593
Jim!

1330
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,555
Let me come.

1331
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,151
I'm glad that's over.

1332
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:03,820
Oh, don't know
when they're more unpleasant,

1333
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,773
when they're dead
or when they're guzzling our rations.

1334
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,984
Drop 'em down here,
we'll take them upstairs later.

1335
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:09,781
Janet!

1336
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:12,864
Oh, don't wake her, Mrs Bates,
she's only just got to sleep.

1337
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,327
What's happened?

1338
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,705
-It's all right, help's coming.
- Oh.

1339
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:21,130
We're going to give the Germans
a bit of their own back.

1340
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,055
Hello? Orlter?

1341
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,763
They've got through to Upton.
They're sending Home Guards and Regulars.

1342
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:34,968
So.

1343
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,433
I can't hold this place.

1344
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,186
I'll transfer the apparatus to the manor house.

1345
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,187
It must work tonight,
according to instructions.

1346
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,859
I can protect it there for 48 hours.

1347
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,608
They have weapons, they'll put up a fight.

1348
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,529
I'll give them no chance to fight.

1349
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,448
Listen, here are your orders.

1350
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,990
You'll go to the manor house,
open the French windows.

1351
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:54,618
- Yes. Yes.
- Drawing room, nine o'clock.

1352
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,540
I'll have the French windows
in the drawing room open at nine o'clock.

1353
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,163
The lorries can drive right up to the house.

1354
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:01,120
- Okay. Get moving.
- Very good, sir.

1355
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,645
Now then, what are we going to put on top?

1356
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,728
- I know. Grandfather.
- Yes.

1357
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:33,903
I wonder why people keep these things
when they've stopped going.

1358
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,245
TOM: All in now, sir.

1359
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:42,578
We're barricading all the downstairs
windows, sir, is that okay?

1360
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,708
Sure.

1361
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:46,711
We've got enough weapons to command
all the approaches from upstairs.

1362
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:47,916
Better concentrate our fire.

1363
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,673
The back's the danger point.

1364
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,628
No need to worry
about the drawing room side.

1365
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,259
Not a scrap of cover.

1366
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,511
Jerries never risk an attack
from that direction.

1367
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,468
That's right enough.

1368
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,100
At any rate,
I'll be keeping a watch on that side.

1369
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,930
We've done the dining room.
Can I help you now?

1370
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,358
No, it's all right, I can manage.
You get on with the drawing room.

1371
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,481
- Okay, admiral.
- All right.

1372
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,613
I'll give them a hand, as far as I can.

1373
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,283
All out! Side of the road!

1374
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:26,121
Take four men. Corporal, four men.

1375
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:27,956
Make for the lawn facing the French windows.

1376
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,168
- Four men!
- Wilsford will open them in 10 minutes.

1377
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,378
Right, sir. Follow me.

1378
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:56,360
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1379
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,789
Well, that's about all we can do there.

1380
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,088
If there's any firing this side,
see they get down behind here.

1381
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,340
- What about the downstairs windows?
- We barricaded the lot.

1382
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,217
Mr Wilsford's going round to make sure.

1383
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:19,800
- He's downstairs?
- Yes. Now, listen, you kids,

1384
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,518
whatever happens, you stay put.

1385
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,642
If one of you so much <i>as</i> budges an inch,

1386
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:27,850
I'll take you out to sea with me
and make you walk the plank.

1387
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:31,028
Silly! Who does he think he is, Captain Bligh?

1388
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,693
Now, one Tommy gun with Charlie.

1389
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:40,825
One, two more here, one spare magazine.

1390
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,078
One pistol, and one, two, three, four rifles.

1391
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,955
Ha! Woolwich Arsenal!

1392
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,878
- Ever fired a rifle, either of you?
- Only a shotgun.

1393
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:53,551
- I once won a bottle of scent at Blackpool.
- Well, I'll have to show you as best as I can.

1394
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,629
Peg, keep watch out of that window, will you?

1395
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,797
Ivy, I'll show you first.

1396
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:07,231
- Is this loaded?
- Yes, think you can handle it?

1397
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,311
Well enough.

1398
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:15,155
- That's right. Now you, Peggy.
-Okay. Ivy, watch the window.

1399
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,779
Now, watch this carefully.
When you wanna load,

1400
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:22,159
you push the safety catch forward,
open the bolt, push in your clip,

1401
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,411
-and close the bolt and it's ready to fire.
- I see.

1402
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,868
If you're not going to fire,
put the safety catch on again.

1403
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,672
- Hello, Nora.
- What are you doing?

1404
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:39,631
- Barricading the window.
- It was barricaded already.

1405
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,387
- The latch was undone, I was bolting it.
- Unbolting it.

1406
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:43,558
Nora!

1407
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:53,603
- The fun's starting all right.
- Lie still.

1408
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,363
I've got a good part of the lawn
covered from here.

1409
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,365
- Ought to be farther back, Charlie.
- All right, I've finished with that.

1410
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,660
Give me the lamp.
Get Bridget to make him some tea.

1411
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:03,779
Tom! Tom, they're coming.

1412
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,957
Look! Over there by the tree.

1413
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:11,333
Peggy, we'd better see if there are any
coming round the other side of the house.

1414
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,151
Duck, madam, duck!

1415
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,233
All right, Sims, I am ducking.

1416
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:43,235
Come on.

1417
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:52,164
- How you doing, Peg?
- Fine.

1418
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:04,344
- What's up?
- I shot one.

1419
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:07,266
Good girl.
You know, we ought to keep a score.

1420
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:08,514
That's one to you.

1421
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,345
Half a minute, now I'll have a go.

1422
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:15,943
Missed him. Can't even hit a sitting Jerry.

1423
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:19,195
Oh, thank goodness they're here.

1424
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,532
- Harry!
- Oh, Mr Drew!

1425
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,701
We've done a bit of scouting,
they've packed up in a lorry

1426
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,119
and driven off towards the manor.

1427
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,117
- Can't we join you?
- No, you stop here.

1428
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,789
And carry on with the phones.

1429
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:32,785
This is the last one.

1430
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,713
Oh, that's what he needs.

1431
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:40,668
You stay with him. I must go to the children.
Go on all fours.

1432
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:46,840
- Duck!
- Not again!

1433
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:56,391
- All safe and sound?
- CHILDREN: Yes, thank you, Mrs Fraser.

1434
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,101
Well, George got to Upton all right.

1435
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,903
- Good. Good old George.
- When are the soldiers coming?

1436
01:30:00,979 --> 01:30:03,903
- They'll be here any moment now.
- I wish they were here now.

1437
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,325
Oh, she's yellow.

1438
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:34,476
- I've run out of ammunition.
- Here, I've got some.

1439
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:45,073
- Ivy, give me your rifle.
- I've only two rounds left.

1440
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,972
Get down!

1441
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,921
Yes, that's the only bit of England they got.

1442
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:53,349
On Monday night, Hitler tried his invasion.

1443
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,928
You know how that went up in smoke.

1444
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,896
We're proud of ourselves here,

1445
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:01,691
proud we had the chance to do our bit,

1446
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:04,519
but proudest of all for those who died,

1447
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:07,231
died in the battle for Bramley End.
