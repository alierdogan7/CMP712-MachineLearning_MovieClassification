1
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:03,495
Name is John Carter, US
special forces Intel

2
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:08,323
Long range reconnaissance op. Why am
I telling you this? I don't know.

3
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:13,527
Maybe it's not important, but
someone wiser than me once told me:

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,128
"You can tell a lot about
a man by what he does"

5
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:20,332
I run a single man
operation, deep in country.

6
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,628
Territory so remote, that even
the site of a lone jar-head

7
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:26,254
is considered more of a
novelty than a threat.

8
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,097
My missions are classified, as
I'm sure my story would be.

9
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:33,558
Except no one would believe it.

10
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:00,331
- New folks?
- Many people pass through this area.

11
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:04,433
- It's not shearing season and the
poppies haven't been harvested yet.

12
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:08,777
- You've been here for too long.
- I'll drink to that.

13
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,956
I used to know your father. He used to
stand up tho these kinds of people.

14
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,472
My father died because of your people.

15
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:21,512
You Americans, Russians, everyone
wants a piece of what we have here.

16
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,402
There are too many hands
reaching into the barrel.

17
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,606
Soon you will see there's
nothing left to take out.

18
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,723
There is nothing
left here for you.

19
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:30,837
That's a very nice speech

20
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:35,493
but you truly believe that your wife
and son will be safer once I'm gone?

21
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:47,001
- Maybe not be my wife.
- That's funny.

22
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:49,692
She likes you, you
should take her with you

23
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:52,567
She's too heavy, I can't carry that much.

24
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,176
I'll give you a cart.

25
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:00,900
I don't know who they are. They have a
camp outside of town and they need trucks.

26
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:05,660
They seem to have a lot of money,
but no one is getting in their way.

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,130
Except the prostitutes.

28
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:10,262
Then your wife is doing pretty good.

29
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:58,813
Hey!

30
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,679
Let him go.

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,149
What is so funny?

32
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:19,524
The look on your face when I blow
up all your opium and those trucks.

33
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,987
- How do you know this is opium?
- You're right.

34
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,425
- Why don't we find out.
- The American doesn't joke.

35
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:31,674
Look, I let go of this, and you
can say goodbye to everything.

36
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,057
Let him go.

37
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,297
Thank you John Carter.

38
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:03,766
I owe you one.

39
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:49,559
- You said you wouldn't hurt them!
- Lower the gun. You don't want to do this.

40
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,152
Lower the gun.

41
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,707
Trust me, you don't wanna do this.  Don't.

42
00:05:56,465 --> 00:06:00,160
Don't!  It's a loaded gun.

43
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,090
Please.

44
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:11,668
- Get out of the way little sheep.
- Ahh!

45
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,762
Mongrel!  I shall shoot both of you!

46
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:17,114
Don't!

47
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:19,793
Don't do it.

48
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,153
Listen to what I'm saying.

49
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:24,547
You don't want to do this.

50
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:27,375
You don't wanna take part in this OK?
You just wanna get outa here.

51
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:29,198
Go on and live your life.

52
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,229
That's it.

53
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:17,273
I'm not authorizing this unless I have
your full assurance that this procedure

54
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,306
will not have adverse affects.

55
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:23,587
We've had a 100% success rate so far.

56
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:31,158
Surgeons tell me most in your condition,
don't even regain consciousness.

57
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,923
You're probably wondering
what your prognosis is...

58
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,939
You're not expected to
make it through the night.

59
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,189
All of your major
systems, are failing.

60
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,031
But that's OK ...

61
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:45,494
because we have this.

62
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,161
The entire data to reconstruct
you, atom by atom, lives on this.

63
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:52,818
16 GB of flash memory stick.

64
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,849
Now, you don't have to answer this now.

65
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,701
Because you already signed the papers,
we don't need your permission.

66
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:03,740
Just wanted to let you know, if you were
concerned this procedure isn't working,

67
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,303
Don't worry.

68
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:09,029
We've tested it out previously
on a human subject.

69
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:13,334
And from all signs, that
test was a success.

70
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,615
Teleportation.

71
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:15,849
That's right.

72
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:20,404
You are the perfect candidate
for this operation.

73
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:24,083
It was funny the other
day when you said Mars.

74
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:28,325
Quite prescient really. We
are sending you to Mars.

75
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,497
Not the Mars that you
thin, this is Mars-216.

76
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:35,896
a small planet in the orbit Alpha-Centauri.
The fourth planet out from its sun.

77
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:41,333
Our scans show an exceeding possibility
that this planet could hold life.

78
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,591
We certainly believe it has an atmosphere.

79
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,974
We haven't been able to penetrate to its
surface, but you'll do that for us.

80
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,224
Do you have any questions?

81
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:54,951
I don't think he can speak.

82
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,200
He's trying to tell us something.

83
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:01,372
I think he's ready to go.

84
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,513
- Is he one of your kind?
- No.

85
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,928
I believe he's an assassin.

86
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:45,896
Or else, why would he have
gotten onto your ship?

87
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:49,318
- We should finish him.
- But he is unarmed.

88
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,575
It does not take weapons
to kill, my princess.

89
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:57,685
- Avert your eyes.
- No!

90
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:04,170
He can do us no harm now.

91
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:07,357
You are making a big
mistake, my princess.

92
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:09,920
Than I shall suffer
the consequences!

93
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,842
The decision is made.

94
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,904
Very well my princess.

95
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,490
Did you just call me <i>your</i> "princess"?

96
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,498
A thousand pardons,

97
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,686
I meant... Your Highness.

98
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,303
While I am grateful for
all you have done,

99
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,616
Only one man shall ever
call me "his Princess."

100
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,568
And that man will be blessed.

101
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,732
Time will tell.

102
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:17,500
This is either a really good sign,
or a really, really bad one.

103
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:22,579
Um...

104
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:24,680
Well...

105
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:28,867
I'm really sorry about what
happened, to your egg.

106
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:33,844
It seemed to me like you guys were
having such a good time and laughing,

107
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:38,180
maybe we can uh ... smash
some more together.

108
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,930
Ok.  Forget about that.

109
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:48,234

Well, actually from Virginia really.

This is Sola.

177
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,115
I'm... John Carter.

178
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:16,138
- There was something in that bug, right?
- Yes.

179
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,763
The Jubilee Beetle allows
all to communicate.

180
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,724
Interesting.

181
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:23,841
They taste like crap.

182
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:25,763
Crap?

183
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:27,373
Never mind.

184
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:31,818
I have a lot of questions for you.

185
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,966
And I for you.

186
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,943
Thank you.

187
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:47,826
Am I free to go?

188
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,935
You have earned you position amongst us.
As our tradition,

189
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,682
You are offered the things of the
warrior you defeated on the first day.

190
00:27:56,707 --> 00:28:00,045
You may have his quarters,
and his retinue of slaves.

191
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,182
Well, I'm not in need of any slaves.

192
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,511
Maybe some of his possessions.

193
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,315
Did he have something I could possibly use?

194
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,050
He did have a lot of debts.

195
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,409
Oh.

196
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,246
Well, I should have
killed that big fat guy.

197
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,096
Tal Hajus!

198
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,878
Do not speak of him with those tones.

199
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:25,448
Well pardon me.  I know he's...

200
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:28,386
your supreme leader.

201
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:32,378
But when the shit hit the fan, he
was the first one to split town.

202
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,309
You see many things John Carter.

203
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:39,315
Yeah, I like to fight with
people that wanna stick around.

204
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:42,168
Time may come when things
like that are settled.

205
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:45,112
We have a saying here on Barsoom.

206
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,604
The slowest road to a destination,

207
00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:52,284
is often the most rewarding.

208
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:53,814
You will love golf.

209
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:55,965
Golf?

210
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,877
Everyone to the station!

211
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,574
What's going on?

212
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:06,917
This does not concern you.

213
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,729
Under no circumstances interfere.

214
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:13,956
I can not promise that we won't
confuse you for the enemy. Ha!

215
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,465
Fire!

216
00:29:48,832 --> 00:29:49,871
Look out!

217
00:29:57,285 --> 00:30:00,887
Aim for the pilot!
He's flying that craft!

218
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:05,410
Fire!

219
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:16,332
Fire!

220
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,496
Aim for the Pilot!

221
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,522
Hit them better.  Come on!

222
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,748
Ready the hooks!

223
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,475
Ready,

224
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:09,428
Heave.

225
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:11,264
Heave!

226
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:15,841
You missed it!
It's getting away.

227
00:31:18,654 --> 00:31:21,670
Bring in the Tharks.
Mount up!

228
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:30,490
We can't let them get away!

229
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,756
Bring all the survivors to me.

230
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,492
- Stay away from us!
- I'm not here to hurt you.

231
00:33:27,517 --> 00:33:29,273
But you attacked the ship before.

232
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:30,859
I've never been here.

233
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:34,546
- Then you are a madman!
- You've seen me on this ship?

234
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:36,140
I have.

235
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,844
Please tell me what happened.

236
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:41,085
Sab Than said you were
here to kill the princess.

237
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:44,632
No, I'm not here to kill anyone.

238
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:51,210
I'll make you a deal. Help us or those
Tharks will desecrate our bodies!

239
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,828
If they find us, they
will do horrible things!

240
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,148
Please, there's not much
time you must help us!

241
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:01,593
Just take us away from here and
I'll tell you what you wanna know!

242
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,070
Our bodies can not fall to them.

243
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,422
No! Take her first please.

244
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:38,070
Thank you.

245
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,976
When I die, please bury us together.

246
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,109
Here, take some water.

247
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,742
Can you tell me who that woman was?

248
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:54,506
She's Dejah Thoris princess of Helium.

249
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,600
They must not capture her!

250
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:01,461
You also must promise one other thing,

251
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,031
If you find her, you must
not let her marry Sab Than.

252
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:08,453
- Who's that?
- He did this to us.

253
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:12,390
Do you know who I am?

254
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,415
No.

255
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:16,445
I am Kantos Kan.

256
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,648
Master engineer of the
royal pumping station.

257
00:35:19,673 --> 00:35:21,695
We were en route to change out the crew.

258
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:23,593
Okay alright.  Take it easy.
Take it easy!

259
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:30,437
Remember this. Day by day, night by
night we keep the air clean and bright.

260
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:34,367
Day by day, night by
night we keep the air clean and bright.

261
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:39,140
Day by day, night by
night we keep the air clean and bright.

262
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:42,461
Can you tell me what happened on that ship?
When I was there.

263
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:44,625
The princess...

264
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,273
Damn.

265
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,039
Hey.

266
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:46,773
Wait a second, that's not the
way to treat a rescuer now.

267
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:48,359
I doubt those are your motives.

268
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,242
And I am in no need of rescue.

269
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,492
Look, I don't know
if you noticed,

270
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:53,641
but there's a hundred
of <i>those guys</i> coming

271
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,748
down here to get you
so we have to go.

272
00:36:55,773 --> 00:36:57,500
What do you want of me?

273
00:36:57,525 --> 00:36:59,891
Look, I will explain later but
we have to get out of here.

274
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,391
Why were you on my ship?

275
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:04,150
Your ship? I was there
to help Kantos Kan.

276
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,726
- You've seen Kantos Kan?
- Yeah, I spoke to him.

277
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:10,289
- You're lying.
- Look, I will explain later.

278
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,781
- Are you coming with me or not?
- Stay back!

279
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,070
How can I trust you?

280
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:18,524
I'm the only friend you've got.

281
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:27,367
I promise I'm not going to give you
up to a bunch of bloodthirsty Tharks.

282
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:36,728
You will thank me later.

283
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:54,189
The prisoner's mine!

284
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:29,752
On behalf of all Tharks,

285
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:32,164
for performing bravely in battle

286
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:36,744
and for capturing one so
important, the Princess of Mars,

287
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,666
We award you this fighting harness.

288
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,573
You are now Jeddak.

289
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:44,914
Among Tharks.

290
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,306
Let me explain.  It's not what you think.

291
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:08,791
I'm still on your side.

292
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:21,322
That was her pee bucket.

293
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:28,143
I should be honored,
she is the princess.

294
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:30,699
Good thing you haven't
been feeding her much.

295
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,004
Let me ask you something. When a
princess gets to uh, to Hajus

296
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:38,856
What's gonna happen?

297
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:44,496
The people of Helium have inflicted
many wounds on the Tharks.

298
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,169
Tal Hajus will reflect on this.

299
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:52,340
One might think that the princess
could be a bargaining chip.

300
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:55,947
A way to advance the cause of
the Tharks on this planet.

301
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,183
But, Tal Hajus does not think like this.

302
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,215
He will most likely send her to her death.

303
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,707
But not before torturing her horribly.

304
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:08,855
It is his way.

305
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:13,394
How did Tal Hajus become supreme leader?

306
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:18,012
Like all of us, Tal Hajus
earned his rank through battle.

307
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:21,847
He fought his way to his position.
Killing all those before him.

308
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,293
He moved up as you are.
And I.

309
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:33,308
Do you think you could abscond
with her, and that cage?

310
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,387
Surely someone
must have the key.

311
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,144
I thought so.

312
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,575
You're not gonna throw
anything at me are you?

313
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:44,648
I forgive you.

314
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
You do?

315
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:53,685
I see now that you're
with these savages

316
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,521
because you're too ashamed of
yourself to live amongst men.

317
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,919
I've heard of ones like you.

318
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,903
You don't feel that you
deserve to live in society,

319
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:05,603
don't feel that you deserve anything good.

320
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:08,526
So you just lurk around the edges,

321
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:11,159
never really accomplishing
anything in life.

322
00:42:11,884 --> 00:42:13,861
Never even having a family.

323
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,803
Excuse me?

324
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,300
I forgive you.

325
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,909
See these people, these Tharks,

326
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:27,345
As bad as they seem, they have honor.

327
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,791
How can there be honor in
holding someone in a cage?

328
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:33,111
You got a point there.

329
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,728
But, they're telling me your people
are trying to eliminate them.

330
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:38,315
Not true.

331
00:42:39,713 --> 00:42:42,338
Not all of my people resist them.

332
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:46,838
Certain factions, wish
to have them contained.

333
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:49,783
Okay, that's kind of savage.

334
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:51,955
Mars is a delicate balance.

335
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,392
My people,

336
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:56,908
We run the air pumping stations.

337
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:59,487
Without which, all would perish.

338
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:02,119
They don't respect that.

339
00:43:02,557 --> 00:43:04,791
The raid our villages.

340
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:07,353
We supply the air that keeps us all alive.

341
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:12,728
We keep the air clean and bright.

342
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:17,478
How do you know that?

343
00:43:18,588 --> 00:43:20,611
You must leave now, the
spiderlings are approaching.

344
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,422
- You have to let the princess go.

345
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,939
That is not up to me. We
must leave now. Come on!

346
00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:27,767
It is bad to be caught out in the open.

347
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:29,315
We must move.

348
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:32,447
I'm not going until you
let the princess go.

349
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:38,041
I can not my friend. It would be
too much temptation for you.

350
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:40,978
I will give you this.

351
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:46,291
If I am killed by the spiderlings,
you can have the key!

352
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:52,634
It'll be OK.

353
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,580
Maybe they won't
be able to see us.

354
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,384
They hunt for vibrations.
They don't have eyes.

355
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:01,424
Give me one of your rifles.

356
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:12,483
Duck!

357
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,147
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

358
00:45:29,381 --> 00:45:32,374
- This can't be good.
- Looks like a scout.

359
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:46,567
Back to back!

360
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:07,681
Shit.

361
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:44,033
Give me the key!

362
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:11,830
There you go my princess.

363
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,783
How much longer till we get to Tal Hajus?

364
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:22,916
Maybe a day.

365
00:47:24,072 --> 00:47:26,955
You know, I was thinking that's
not such a good idea. You know?

366
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,276
After we were attacked by the spiderling.

367
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:33,605
one could possibly image that we...

368
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:36,016
got separated.

369
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,461
That the princess...

370
00:47:39,351 --> 00:47:40,968
was lost.

371
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,101
But that is not what happened.

372
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:48,304
<b>One could possibly imagine</b>

373
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:54,696
Then I would be derelict in my duties.

374
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:59,921
There's times where
dereliction is one's duty.

375
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:08,156
You guys have a lot to
learn on this planet.

376
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,250
Thanks!

377
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,000
Next time, better warn me.

378
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:27,546
You're lucky one of my me didn't shoot you.

379
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:30,695
You're lucky I didn't miss.

380
00:48:42,148 --> 00:48:44,406
We have a long ride ahead of us.

381
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:48,343
I will make you a deal.

382
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,031
If you promise not to run away 
with Mr. Carter here,

383
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:57,117
I will allow you to remain out of the cage.

384
00:48:58,412 --> 00:49:00,373
And why would I run off with him?

385
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:04,764
We Tharks may be ... different,

386
00:49:05,504 --> 00:49:07,537
But we are not unperceptive.

387
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:11,209
Your kind,

388
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:15,748
So simple in their behavior but,

389
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:19,561
You don't even know what motivates you.

390
00:49:19,882 --> 00:49:22,740
I'm certainly not motivated
to be anywhere near him.

391
00:49:23,155 --> 00:49:26,069
Like a leaf floating
down the stream,

392
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,998
you are unaware of the current that
runs beneath, plotting your course.

393
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:34,584
You the leaf,

394
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,631
think you control your motion.

395
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:42,365
My only motivation is
to return to my people.

396
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:45,280
forget this experience, and all of you.

397
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,800
That will be for Tal Hajus to decide.

398
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:51,545
Let us go!

399
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,608
- Is that our destination?
- No.

400
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,264
That is a structure of her kind's making.

401
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,209
What is it?

402
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:29,872
They say it cleans the air for us.

403
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:33,668
It is used to control us.

404
00:50:33,693 --> 00:50:36,801
Making us believe that without
them we could not survive.

405
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:39,256
So, you don't even think it works.

406
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:44,451
They say that one man can operate it.

407
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,677
We have a saying, "to plow the
field, it takes more than one Thark"

408
00:50:50,428 --> 00:50:56,498
How can one man run a machine that
filters the air of an entire planet?

409
00:50:57,064 --> 00:50:58,982
It can not be true.

410
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,537
The Royal station.

411
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:20,974
We have to go there. Kantos Kan
and his wife should be there now.

412
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:23,545
Please, we must go.

413
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:26,287
I know nothing of them.

414
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,709
What happens if they didn't make it?

415
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:34,826
Our mission was to deliver a
replacement crew to the station,

416
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:37,037
Kantos Kan and his wife.

417
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:44,084
So it is true. Two people could
run a big machine like that?

418
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:46,037
They don't have to run it,

419
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:48,724
It operates without humans.

420
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:51,928
A royal pumping station
official is appointed for life.

421
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:57,217
Their job is to monitor the machine,
make necessary maintenance,

422
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,838
and if there's trouble,
start the backup system.

423
00:52:01,065 --> 00:52:02,776
They are a fail-safe.

424
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,737
the job of maintaining the
royal planetary pump station,

425
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,096
is the most important
job in this planet.

426
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:12,776
If something were to
happen to the machine,

427
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:15,549
and no one were there
to start the pump

428
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,901
our planet would die.

429
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:23,776
Well I think this calls for a detour.

430
00:52:27,963 --> 00:52:32,487
What do you say we go and
investigate the pumping station?

431
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:37,362
At least to see if Kantos
Kan made it there.

432
00:52:46,355 --> 00:52:48,440
We will not deviate.

433
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:53,651
The princess may believe her words
are truthful, but they are lies.

434
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:58,487
It comes down to me from my elders.
That pumping station does not work!

435
00:52:59,183 --> 00:53:01,550
Look at it, breath the air!

436
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,612
Do you really believe in your
heart that the air you breath

437
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:07,393
comes form that machine?

438
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:11,120
We stay the course.

439
00:53:54,510 --> 00:54:01,088
We are here to see Tal Hajus. We
have with us the princess of Mars.

440
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:32,954
Oh great leader!

441
00:54:32,979 --> 00:54:35,927
What is this you've
interrupted my day with?

442
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:40,588
- I have brought you the princess...
- So it is the Princess of Mars.

443
00:54:41,831 --> 00:54:47,096
You are as ugly as I have been told.

444
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:51,229
I cannot see how your kind worships you.

445
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:58,003
But don't worry. When I am done
with you, I will make you pretty.

446
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:03,409
Your royalness.

447
00:55:06,158 --> 00:55:10,591
The grasshopper speaks! Jumping
bean I barely noticed you.

448
00:55:10,784 --> 00:55:14,174
The princess, as ugly as she may be,

449
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,769
was intercepted.

450
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:20,839
We intercepted the princess
on her way to do business

451
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:23,885
on her way to do business
which may affect all of us.

452
00:55:24,346 --> 00:55:26,049
What could that be?

453
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:29,432
The princess was en route to
the royal pumping station.

454
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:35,691
For years, her kind has used the
pretense of the royal pumping station

455
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:39,276
to keep my kind in
check, to subjugate us.

456
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:41,392
To keep us here
in this wasteland

457
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:44,200
while they hoarded the
fertile grounds to the north!

458
00:55:44,979 --> 00:55:49,057
They keep us in fear. And yet
with her delivered to us,

459
00:55:49,082 --> 00:55:52,698
we now have an opportunity
for our answers.

460
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:54,620
Answers to what?

461
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:58,562
The air you breathe,
is it not still fresh?

462
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:02,586
She never delivered her cargo
to the station. Did she not?

463
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:08,461
Therefore, as we all
suspected, it is a sham!

464
00:56:08,486 --> 00:56:11,922
The machine can operate without
the hand of man of Thark.

465
00:56:11,992 --> 00:56:14,422
It is but a precaution we keep it occupied.

466
00:56:15,336 --> 00:56:19,133
If something were to happen, we
are the only ones who can fix it.

467
00:56:20,025 --> 00:56:25,039
I am sure that such speeches sway
the masses at home, but not here!

468
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:27,913
Your words reek of lies!

469
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:31,612
Your royalness, I think you're
being too harsh on the princess.

470
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:36,492
Who are you to tell me what I can do?

471
00:56:38,242 --> 00:56:42,734
I am John Carter of Mars.

472
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:47,507
Jeddak of the Tharks.

473
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:50,148
Captain of the arms.

474
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:53,312
A Jeddak grasshopper?

475
00:56:53,337 --> 00:56:58,421
Who could have bestowed such a
position upon you, a human?

476
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:07,476
It was I your highness. John Carter
showed great nobility and courage.

477
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:10,843
He fought bravely in
the spiderling attack.

478
00:57:11,301 --> 00:57:15,382
I see before me three abominations.

479
00:57:15,407 --> 00:57:20,351
One, Dejah Thoris princess of lies!

480
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:28,100
Two, John Carter, made
Jeddak against Thark rule

481
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:36,000
and three, Tars Tarkas, loyal warrior
who broke from Thark tradition.

482
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:44,382
No one but I can confer the position of
Jeddak upon another; especially a human!

483
00:57:45,304 --> 00:57:49,403
Tars Tarkas, you have served me well.

484
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:52,960
For this offense I will
relieve you of your command.

485
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:56,461
Remove yourself from
my throne at once!

486
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,164
I will find a place for
you amongst my servants!

487
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:06,139
John Carter, as told you
are a great fighter.

488
00:58:06,164 --> 00:58:10,914
I will allow you to use your
gifts in the fight pits tonight.

489
00:58:11,984 --> 00:58:17,367
Dejah Thoris, horrible princess

490
00:58:17,516 --> 00:58:20,399
Your fate I will savor.

491
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:26,257
For all those years that
you subjugated my people

492
00:58:26,282 --> 00:58:29,609
for so long with your malicious lies

493
00:58:29,781 --> 00:58:37,400
I will see to it that no words will
ever be issued from your lips.

494
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:41,382
Lips that I will not
waste I might add.

495
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,640
Let my will be done!

496
00:59:15,665 --> 00:59:17,843
This doesn't look too good.

497
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:04,929
I have a task for you. But first
prepare the animals to ride.

498
01:00:51,572 --> 01:00:52,822
I've seen you before,

499
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,806
on the Princess' ship.

500
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:00,939
If I'm lucky enough to
meetcha in the arena,

501
01:01:02,072 --> 01:01:03,408
I'm gonna kill you.

502
01:01:05,392 --> 01:01:07,204
Not if I kill you first.

503
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:08,072
Sarka!

504
01:01:08,275 --> 01:01:10,462
I'm so happy to see you my friend.

505
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:12,369
What are you doing here?

506
01:01:12,394 --> 01:01:14,635
You Americans are so easy to bribe.

507
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:18,908
I think I was dying. I told them were
I kept 10 million All my profits.

508
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:21,079
If only they could keep me alive.

509
01:01:21,556 --> 01:01:26,321
Then the spook agent came. NSA/CIA?
I gave them everything.

510
01:01:26,345 --> 01:01:27,134
No!

511
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:30,150
They even promised me amnesty
if I was successful.

512
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:32,476
The I came here.

513
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:34,634
What were you doing with the princess?

514
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,041
It was fate.

515
01:01:36,422 --> 01:01:38,048
We were destined to be together.

516
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:43,700
We were both on the ship together,

517
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,657
when I was teleported.

518
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:47,837
Bingo!

519
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:54,704
You told them I was an assassin didn't you?

520
01:01:54,822 --> 01:01:57,181
You're a soldier, a killer.

521
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:02,923
I'm gonna have fun killing you.

522
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,723
You were lucky once.

523
01:02:32,473 --> 01:02:34,770
It won't happen again John Carter.

524
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:35,996
You're dead.

525
01:03:02,781 --> 01:03:05,036
What is wrong with you Tharks?

526
01:03:06,497 --> 01:03:09,083
Don't you guys have reality TV?

527
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,100
That's how it's going down huh?

528
01:03:58,676 --> 01:03:59,865
shit

529
01:04:11,132 --> 01:04:12,896
I'm not gonna fight him.

530
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,654
We have to fight!

531
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,881
I'm not gonna fight you!

532
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:36,865
I want you to know, that
you were honorable.

533
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:39,786
I was glad to have you as part of my squad.

534
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:49,318
If we don't fight,
they'll kill us both.

535
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,428
Since I beat you, then
I'll be commander right?

536
01:05:05,453 --> 01:05:09,555
If I were commander. When you
defeat a Thark in Battle,

537
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:18,500
If you were to defeat Tal Hajus,
then I'd be commander right?

538
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:21,812
If I could defeat him, yes.

539
01:05:24,406 --> 01:05:26,188
You just don't quit do you?

540
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:29,227
A Thark may never concede a fight.

541
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:32,117
Have it your way then.

542
01:06:22,775 --> 01:06:24,297
Come with me.

543
01:06:29,227 --> 01:06:31,578
What about John Carter, Tars Tarkas?

544
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:33,796
I have my orders, we must leave.
There is no time.

545
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:35,359
Your absence will be discovered

546
01:07:12,105 --> 01:07:13,582
It's my lucky night!

547
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:24,796
We will have to finish this
at another venture Carter.

548
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:26,077
Why is that?

549
01:07:26,102 --> 01:07:30,147
I have someone else I need to meet.
She is a bit more important.

550
01:07:30,741 --> 01:07:32,733
Oh I'm sure she'll be pleased.

551
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:37,514
knowing you're coming after
you slaughtered Kantos Kan,

552
01:07:43,062 --> 01:07:44,664
Have you learned nothing?

553
01:07:45,704 --> 01:07:47,397
If you have a superpower,

554
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:57,093
you should keep it hidden.

555
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:11,716
It's time to end this.

556
01:09:02,478 --> 01:09:05,782
I challenge you for
leadership of the tribe.

557
01:09:06,024 --> 01:09:07,915
Do you accept the challenge?

558
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:10,563
Only I can issue such a command.

559
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:12,775
Do you accept the challenge?!

560
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:15,020
Die!

561
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:22,306
You are unfit to command!

562
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,896
Who amongst those witness to
this, denies my right to command?

563
01:10:01,756 --> 01:10:03,014
Where's the princess?

564
01:10:03,419 --> 01:10:05,833
She went with Sab Than
to the pumping station.

565
01:10:05,858 --> 01:10:07,240
They took off in a flier.

566
01:10:07,512 --> 01:10:09,365
Do you have another flier?

567
01:10:12,624 --> 01:10:13,997
I'll meet you there!

568
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:25,850
What happened to Kantos Kan and his wife?

569
01:11:25,943 --> 01:11:28,097
I'm afraid the Tharks got them.

570
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:29,724
But how did you survive?

571
01:11:29,749 --> 01:11:32,334
It wasn't easy, I was
captured, just like you.

572
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:36,013
But the flier, how did
you manage to get it?

573
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:38,240
The Tharks had it. They
shot it down like yours.

574
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,138
And you were a prisoner of Tal Hajus?

575
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:41,006
Yes.

576
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:43,490
Did you see John Carter?

577
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,294
I did.

578
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:47,224
Is he alive?

579
01:11:48,716 --> 01:11:50,935
No, he died in the arena.

580
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,435
If it is any consolation,
he helped me escape.

581
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:01,098
He told me it was a great honor to
have served you in your journey.

582
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:04,944
If he survived, he would have
liked to have been your servant.

583
01:12:05,201 --> 01:12:05,951
He said that?

584
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:07,971
A rough translation.

585
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:11,919
That's funny, I
thought he hated me.

586
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,490
No, furthest from the truth.

587
01:12:16,638 --> 01:12:19,161
He felt about you the same way I do.

588
01:12:19,357 --> 01:12:20,380
Like what?

589
01:12:21,919 --> 01:12:23,264
I love you.

590
01:12:28,195 --> 01:12:30,286
My heart can only go to one person.

591
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:32,162
And I want to be that person.

592
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:34,849
- But it has already gone out.
- To who?

593
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,865
It does not matter, he's dead now.

594
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:39,107
I have no more heart to give.

595
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:41,170
It can't be.

596
01:12:41,795 --> 01:12:43,810
We can talk about this later.

597
01:12:44,474 --> 01:12:46,943
Right now we have to find the
current keeper of the station,

598
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,767
assess the situation.

599
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:19,758
Hello?

600
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,429
Is anyone there?

601
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,961
Hello?

602
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,968
- Good day.
- Atol Nard?

603
01:13:37,137 --> 01:13:38,304
Princess.

604
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:40,352
Is everything OK in there?

605
01:13:40,937 --> 01:13:43,039
This is highly unusual.

606
01:13:43,064 --> 01:13:44,203
Let us in!

607
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:45,508
Who are you?

608
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:47,226
He's with me.

609
01:13:55,367 --> 01:13:57,265
Princess. Thank you.

610
01:13:58,563 --> 01:13:59,578
Your highness.

611
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:02,828
Please, we're here to assess the station.

612
01:14:21,093 --> 01:14:25,336
Everything is in fine working order
princess. No parts need replacement.

613
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:28,953
Everything is as it was 700
years ago, when I began.

614
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:32,804
Is this man my replacement?

615
01:14:32,829 --> 01:14:35,461
No I'm sorry, they were killed.

616
01:15:04,693 --> 01:15:08,201
So this is it, this
is the heart of it?

617
01:15:08,226 --> 01:15:11,271
Yes this is all of it.  Hydrogen fusion.

618
01:15:16,614 --> 01:15:17,943
Do you know what this is?

619
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:19,623
I wouldn't touch that.

620
01:15:20,134 --> 01:15:21,708
But you know what this is.

621
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:26,560
<i>Something... you shouldn’t be touching.</i>

622
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:35,654
If you know what this is, I don't
think you'll come closer to me.

623
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:37,216
What do you want?

624
01:15:37,404 --> 01:15:40,076
I want an answer ... from her.

625
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:44,396
I want you to be mine.

626
01:15:46,904 --> 01:15:48,740
Will you be with me?

627
01:15:49,068 --> 01:15:50,170
I cannot.

628
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,310
My heart belongs to another.

629
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,466
No!!!

630
01:16:03,412 --> 01:16:06,380
You're an idiot.  They have a backup.

631
01:16:07,654 --> 01:16:10,857
I don't need you. I just
needed to know where it is.

632
01:18:15,844 --> 01:18:17,211
I can see you.

633
01:18:18,821 --> 01:18:21,555
Sarka!
Not there either.

634
01:18:22,919 --> 01:18:24,212
Sarka

635
01:18:26,882 --> 01:18:27,954
Sarka!

636
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,555
You're insane.

637
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,718
By my calculations
it will take only 4 hours

638
01:18:42,743 --> 01:18:45,611
for the atmosphere to
leach off this planet.

639
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,842
That is 4 hours longer
than you will be alive.

640
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,248
You always sucked at math Sarka!

641
01:18:52,842 --> 01:18:56,647
You were a shitty opium
dealer, a shitty tea seller

642
01:18:56,672 --> 01:19:00,467
And now, you're a shitty
destroyer of worlds.

643
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:04,482
Come on.

644
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:05,863
I can't believe you're
doing this, over a girl.

645
01:20:07,613 --> 01:20:08,988
It's not really you.

646
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:13,855
The Sarka I know is motivated
by money and power.

647
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:17,505
You might be loosin' it.

648
01:20:17,816 --> 01:20:18,973
You're right.

649
01:20:19,137 --> 01:20:21,299
The girl means nothing to me.

650
01:20:21,324 --> 01:20:24,699
She is immaterial. With
you out of the way,

651
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,113
let's say dead. I shall
restart this pumping station.

652
01:20:29,436 --> 01:20:33,355
But only after Th people of this
plant make me their supreme ruler,

653
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,425
and bring me tribute.

654
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:38,379
With this impenetrable
station as my base,

655
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:41,254
I shall have the best
bargaining chip ever.

656
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:45,074
The air supply. It is
better than drugs.

657
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,574
That's <i>if</i> you can
activate the machine.

658
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:53,777
It is a simple mechanism.
Maybe not for these primitives.

659
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:57,000
They will give me whatever I want.

660
01:20:57,003 --> 01:20:59,621
Just to keep from asphyxiating.

661
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:02,894
You're forgetting one small thing.

662
01:21:02,919 --> 01:21:04,559
And what is that?

663
01:21:07,785 --> 01:21:09,543
I'm gonna kill you.

664
01:21:17,723 --> 01:21:19,692
Heave!

665
01:21:20,933 --> 01:21:24,300
Heave!
Go on, push.

666
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:27,066
Push.

667
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,815
You can do it.

668
01:21:50,793 --> 01:21:51,871
Heave...

669
01:24:38,632 --> 01:24:42,717
I was with Kantos Kan when he died.

670
01:24:43,866 --> 01:24:46,100
He was saying ...

671
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:54,700
Something... day by
day, night by night ,

672
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:01,324
I know.

673
01:25:01,769 --> 01:25:04,370
You do?
Oh, Ok.

674
01:26:19,126 --> 01:26:20,782
Is that it?

675
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:22,900
Is that the controller?

676
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:24,814
That's it.

677
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:26,564
Okay.

678
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,095
Come on.

679
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:42,963
Is it working?

680
01:26:56,729 --> 01:26:58,814
Try harder. Come on,
it's not working.

681
01:27:01,658 --> 01:27:03,298
That's it.  Go on!

682
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,899
That's insane!

683
01:27:12,643 --> 01:27:13,644
Go on.

684
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,000
Faster, faster, faster!

685
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,000
You did it!

686
01:28:56,127 --> 01:28:58,033
I never told them anything.

687
01:28:58,095 --> 01:29:00,509
For them the experiment was a failure.

688
01:29:00,963 --> 01:29:04,970
They didn't expect me to survive, but I
guess I was tougher than they thought.

689
01:29:06,111 --> 01:29:08,681
If they knew the truth, it would be over.

690
01:29:08,797 --> 01:29:11,017
Humans would overrun
the savage planet.

691
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,720
One fighting man from earth
was enough for Barsoom.

692
01:29:15,955 --> 01:29:17,884
They sent me back to active duty.

693
01:29:18,502 --> 01:29:19,744
So now I wait,

694
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:24,330
Biding my time till the day when I
shall return to the red planet and...

695
01:29:25,767 --> 01:29:28,064
the princess of mars.
