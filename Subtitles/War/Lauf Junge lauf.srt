1
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,810
That's my jacket.

2
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,449
Take this.

3
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,247
I'm not done with you.

4
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,089
Come back.

5
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,450
Boy, you must ...

6
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,127
strong and courageous.

7
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,767
You have to survive.

8
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,442
You must survive, you hear?

9
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,763
Never give up, Srulik.

10
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,169
You have to forget your name.

11
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,529
But even if you have to forget everything ...

12
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,322
your name, and even your mother and me ...

13
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,246
you must never forget that you are a Jew, you understand?

14
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,444
Keep secret who you are, but never forget that.

15
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,762
Well, Daddy. I promise.

16
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,806
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

17
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,928
Stand still.

18
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,651
What's your name? - Srulik.

19
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,482
And you?

20
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,405
I'm Awrum. These are my friends.

21
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,403
Are you escaped from the ghetto?

22
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,370
Did you swap something? Jewelry, one watch?

23
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,330
No nothing. - You really something.

24
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,563
Let him. He says he has nothing.

25
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,091
Never been in a wood?

26
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,844
Of course.

27
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,925
To play or mushroom picking.

28
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,049
But not to live there.

29
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,046
Without the forest, the Germans had already caught us.

30
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,170
But they are afraid of partisans. - What are those?

31
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,288
Men with guns. - But then...

32
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,090
Pools?

33
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,090
The forest protects us. Do not be afraid.

34
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,810
I'm not afraid.

35
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,805
Janek, I got the cherries down there. - When she goes inside ...

36
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,611
Icek Ljebele and go to the vegetable garden.

37
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,162
Josele and I grab the cheese pockets of the fence.

38
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,721
I grab a chicken.

39
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,928
And I'm going for that cherries.

40
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,562
What? I am rapidly.

41
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,485
Watch out. It's not a game.

42
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,241
Go.

43
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,206
I have.

44
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,570
Thieves.

45
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,248
Damn, dirty Jews. I beat you up.

46
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,846
I'll kill you. - Help me.

47
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,004
What will they do with him? - With Ljebele?

48
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,403
They bring him to the Germans for a reward.

49
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,767
Can I have one? - Of course.

50
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,688
Want some cherries?

51
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,010
Not bad, kid.

52
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,605
Not bad?

53
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,411
What about me? You should thank me.

54
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,688
I'm hunting king.

55
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,127
Josele, give me the knife.

56
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,528
Got from my grandfather. I'm the only one knife.

57
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,321
We must not pick him first?

58
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,970
Dummy.

59
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,202
There is a better way.

60
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,404
What are you doing? - My wound cleaning.

61
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,203
Remember: After cleaning, you should disinfect it.

62
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,691
I want the chest.

63
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,128
I want the other half. - That's not fair.

64
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,090
You had the last time. Now I want him.

65
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,722
Hurry up. - Take it easy.

66
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,723
I'm hungry.

67
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,931
What are you thinking of?

68
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,321
Your parents?

69
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,324
Do not think of the past.

70
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,002
That makes it worse.

71
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,040
Think rather of what it is to see each other again.

72
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,204
That is much finer. Then you fall asleep naturally.

73
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,522
Do you have brothers or sisters?

74
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,521
Two brothers and two sisters.

75
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,571
My older brother JÃ³zef is the best smuggler in the ghetto.

76
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,644
He took sometime two roots with it.

77
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,529
And your father?

78
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,121
He said he would come and get us if it somewhere safe did for us.

79
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,760
Has he been gone long?

80
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,041
My father is a shoemaker. And yours?

81
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,201
Bakker.

82
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,331
When I came into the bakery, I got a sandwich.

83
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,165
A warm, right out of the oven.

84
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,443
What kijk_je doing? Look the other way.

85
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,129
Remember, Srulik:

86
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,762
Never pull your pants if Poland are watching.

87
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,890
Why not? - Because you're circumcised.

88
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,884
And the Poles do not?

89
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,807
Here's another one.

90
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,889
I have one too.

91
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,209
On the ground.

92
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,129
Run.

93
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,482
That way.

94
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,088
Awrum.

95
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,651
Josele. Icek.

96
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,883
Sofia.

97
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,081
Gotcha.

98
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,366
I just have a few chickens.

99
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,966
They shot the pig and the cow.

100
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,849
Why?

101
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,684
My husband and my sons are with the partisans.

102
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,682
You know what his partisans?

103
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,207
Men with guns. Poland.

104
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,328
Can you stand up?

105
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,371
After three days, it's time to move your muscles.

106
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,843
You were with me at the door ...

107
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,209
almost frozen with the cold.

108
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,361
Do you remember?

109
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,364
You can stay a while.

110
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,126
But stay inside and do not stand at the window.

111
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,009
Understood?

112
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,602
My name is Magda Janczyk. And you?

113
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,331
Herb. Herb Staniak.

114
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,849
A beautiful name.

115
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,203
Even though it is not your real name, right?

116
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,085
I say it to anyone. It's good that you've got a Polish name.

117
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,084
To me you Jurek Staniak. Ready.

118
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,085
I'll show you where you can hide when the Germans come.

119
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,562
You have no brothers or sisters.

120
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,282
When the war began, your parents and you fled your village.

121
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,688
What was that village?

122
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,446
I forgot.

123
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,011
You sat in a carriage.

124
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,049
With a lot of other people.

125
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,249
When clipped a German aircraft over us.

126
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,131
It flew low and started shooting at us.

127
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,365
I jumped into a ditch, but my parents will not make it.

128
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,488
The Lord is with you ...

129
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,564
thou art blessed among women ...

130
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,564
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

131
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,210
Hail Mary ...

132
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,931
Divine Mother ... - Mother of God.

133
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,687
Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour ...

134
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,926
Mother of God, have mercy on my sons you and my husband.

135
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,969
Help them to survive the winter.

136
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,170
And make sure nothing happens to them. Amen.

137
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,850
And?

138
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,170
Hello, I am ...

139
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,642
Do not hesitate, it arouses suspicion.

140
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,010
Who are you? What do you want?

141
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,810
I am Jesus Christ, blessed Jurek Staniak.

142
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,126
Did I say something wrong?

143
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,603
Blessed ...

144
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,920
My husband made them.

145
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,761
Merry Christmas, Jurek.

146
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,331
They have been my youngest son.

147
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,685
They have him now too small.

148
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,325
You there. Have you seen a little boy?

149
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,211
He came this way.

150
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,081
If you stay still, I take you out of the ghetto.

151
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,687
If you want to stay, you have to jump now.

152
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,569
Our.

153
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,609
Halt.

154
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,768
Paper.

155
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,845
Continue.

156
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,170
Mama?

157
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,684
Have you seen my child?

158
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,649
Halt.

159
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,442
Mama.

160
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,885
Jurek, you've dreamed of.

161
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,682
Shall I leave the candle stand?

162
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,844
Try to sleep.

163
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,209
Herb Staniak.

164
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,927
Jurek, wake up.

165
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,761
Tonight I heard voices and saw footprints around the house.

166
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,321
It's too dangerous for you here.

167
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,042
Remember, if you are a once in great need ...

168
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,009
then come here.

169
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,482
But you're a good boy. The people help you.

170
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,448
This will also help you.

171
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,050
It will open many doors for you.

172
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,649
Herb.

173
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,205
What is it?

174
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,250
Blessed be Jesus Christ.

175
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,605
I'm Jurek Sta ...

176
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,206
We have no food. Go away.

177
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,530
Blessed be Jesus Christ.

178
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,769
Until eternity.

179
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,888
Ik ben herb Staniak.

180
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,125
Come on in.

181
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,047
My parents were there. They no longer moved.

182
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,410
What people took me, but the farmer hit me, so I fled.

183
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,121
Now I work here and there. And if somebody beats me, I continue.

184
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,009
Poor boy.

185
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,803
Dank u.

186
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,444
So ...

187
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,249
Go eat.

188
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,010
Thanks ever.

189
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,490
Jurek, stirring constantly.

190
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,567
Can we play football?

191
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,965
Put it in, then you can go.

192
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,483
Are you coming?

193
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,688
In the winter? - So what?

194
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,764
Why pass you back? - Idiot.

195
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,445
Fit.

196
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,844
Jew.

197
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,968
SPRING 1943

198
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,200
What happened to your leg? Shows.

199
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,049
Does it hurt?

200
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,325
Come with me.

201
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,606
Come on. Come.

202
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,130
I hope your father is happy with a dog.

203
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,805
Papa.

204
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,247
We have to kill him, he is in pain.

205
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,687
That is certainly not Jurek.

206
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,285
Azor either.

207
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,091
Almost finished. - Is not it too tight?

208
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,528
I do not think so.

209
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,765
Herb.

210
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,082
How's your wolf?

211
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,449
Better. Nice huh?

212
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,880
SUMMER 1943

213
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,722
Who is going to win today?

214
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,402
I think Franek.

215
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,243
I am more than you.

216
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,724
See, I knew he was a Jew.

217
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,770
Do not be ridiculous. And stay away from him.

218
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,651
I'll let you over to the Gestapo.

219
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,841
Good luck, son.

220
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,764
You'll need.

221
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,730
Style.

222
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,807
Okay, you win. Rascal.

223
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,530
You now have your own way?

224
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,090
Azor.

225
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,164
Brave dog.

226
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,249
Azor. Azor, come back.

227
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,011
A group left. Also, at the top.

228
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,166
What are you doing here, son? - Why are you shooting? He did nothing.

229
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,529
What was that shot? - Oh, a rabid dog.

230
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,409
We go on.

231
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,525
You have to go here.

232
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,967
The Germans withdrew deeper into the woods.

233
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,645
Come with me.

234
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,165
Here.

235
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,161
Which you could use.

236
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,209
I used to just such shoes.

237
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,362
I'm very sorry about your dog.

238
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,050
Stay strong.

239
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,450
Hey, kid. Want to earn some food?

240
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,530
Get in.

241
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,569
Help hem even.

242
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,767
You must be hungry.

243
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,723
You will soon have to eat.

244
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,087
They give you eat here though.

245
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,965
So, boy. You've made it easy by Poland.

246
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,761
Now our reward, huh? - All in good time.

247
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,363
Let's see.

248
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,291
I you do not even see dick. You are as Jewish as some.

249
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,522
I am not a Jew. - That will do.

250
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,810
Get your reward on the desk, you bunch of vultures.

251
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,041
I thought so. They have a child again.

252
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,608
Thank you say.

253
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,648
Eat but tasty. Jews are also people.

254
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,484
I am not a Jew.

255
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,648
That hurts.

256
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,727
Do not hit. No.

257
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,610
Srulik.

258
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,681
Srulik.

259
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,763
Hello, Srulik.

260
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,167
How are you?

261
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,850
Mama.

262
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,929
Your turn.

263
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,405
In?

264
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,809
Ingerukt.

265
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,731
Name?

266
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,121
Herb Staniak.

267
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,725
Are you a Jew?

268
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,405
Nee.

269
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,048
Depending located.

270
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,329
Where are your parents?

271
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,960
We were on the flight from our village.

272
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,808
A plane strafed us. Only I survived.

273
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,601
Where do you live? - For farmers for whom I work.

274
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,684
If they beat me, I pull to the next village.

275
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,490
When you're the last time beaten?

276
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,927
Just yet.

277
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,406
Take your pants down.

278
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,168
And what is that?

279
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,290
I had surgery after an infection.

280
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,844
What do you say when you do this?

281
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,368
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

282
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,520
You're a smart lad.

283
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,523
Too bad you're a Jew.

284
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,046
And if you were Polish, we had a partisan quickly again.

285
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,123
Walk.

286
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,890
Partizanen? - Burgers.

287
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,883
Jews? - Yes, both.

288
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,690
Go ahead.

289
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,602
Do you like rabbits?

290
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,490
There are a few in that barn.

291
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,206
Their cage is behind in that corner.

292
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,089
Quiet.

293
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,611
Shut up.

294
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,331
Make them quiet.

295
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,449
Hey, open the door.

296
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,766
Open the damn door.

297
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,602
Get the dogs.

298
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,728
Get him.

299
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,848
No matter what.

300
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,604
He goes to the river.

301
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,162
That young snot does not put us crazy.

302
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,123
Gathering.

303
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,963
Flocks of two. Eyes open. Hurry up.

304
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,283
You look there. Two here. You come with me.

305
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,368
He smells the track.

306
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,770
See anything? In the water.

307
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,643
Let the dog loose.

308
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,406
Take the dog out.

309
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,647
Brave he is.

310
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,287
A burst in the water.

311
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,329
We go.

312
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,729
Hello.

313
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,202
You can sleep here if you want.

314
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,081
But remember: Tomorrow I'll go by myself further.

315
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,164
I do not want anyone to stop me.

316
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,450
Where did you get that chicken? - From a farm near here.

317
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,644
Do they need people?

318
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,280
Such a large ranch probably.

319
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,488
Does the farmer have in common?

320
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,246
I do not know. He slept.

321
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,243
But the chicken was very nice.

322
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,164
The estate is of Polish Germans.

323
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,688
The man is in the army, now Mrs. Herman is the boss.

324
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,322
She looks nice. - She always laughs on Friday.

325
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,929
Then her friend along to spoil her.

326
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,003
What gives it her?

327
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,365
Come on, I imagine.

328
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,882
What is it, Pawel?

329
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,680
This is an orphan, ma'am, he is seeking employment.

330
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,889
He has helped very well today.

331
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,050
Look.

332
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,924
Who do we have here?

333
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,767
My men so hang on stories.

334
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,890
You know that guy? - Of course. That's a ...

335
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,642
That is an Jurek.

336
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,325
Herb Staniak.

337
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,883
I knew it was a smart guy.

338
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,884
Strictly speaking, he's mine.

339
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,087
But if you want him ...

340
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,731
I give him a gift to you.

341
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,481
Zenek. Rest your horse.

342
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,325
And check out his hooves.

343
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,966
Are you hungry?

344
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,884
Jurek. Do not.

345
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,289
Pawel.

346
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,128
The car quickly.

347
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,922
We're ready, doctor.

348
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,484
I operate no Jews. - What?

349
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,690
I operate no Jews. - Impossible, he's Polish.

350
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,047
And I've already paid for the operation.

351
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,410
I'm risking my job not for a Jewish brat. Get him away.

352
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,602
Think it over.

353
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,491
You will regret it.

354
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,766
I have good relations with the SS.

355
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,082
Excellent.

356
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,005
Just ask if they catch him coming.

357
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,764
I promise...

358
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,843
Mother of God ...

359
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,525
Srulik.

360
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,047
Papa?

361
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,886
You have to survive. - I promise.

362
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,169
I'm risking my job not for a Jewish brat.

363
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,527
We have too few painkillers. Many patients may not be enough ...

364
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,601
Why is he here?

365
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,089
What is this?

366
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,762
This really is a scandal.

367
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,849
Sister.

368
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,802
Yesterday we could save his hand.

369
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,850
Today we have to fight for his life.

370
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,084
Sister, scalpel.

371
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,930
Mom. Mom.

372
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,409
Calm down, Jurek.

373
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,881
Go to sleep, baby.

374
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,089
Have patience.

375
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,809
Everything will be fine.

376
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,491
Tomorrow we change the bandage.

377
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,642
This is Sister Aldona. She takes care of you.

378
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,529
Nee.

379
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,770
Look, you love so much.

380
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,888
And some lemonade.

381
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,090
When was operated on my leg.

382
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,923
And now I can do this, you see?

383
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,651
You can now dance. - Yes.

384
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,724
Ja, first.

385
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,882
Very well. A few more.

386
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,407
Now I let you go.

387
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,642
And now alone.

388
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,370
Very well.

389
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,809
Do not give up, you have to fight. Natalia, not pretend.

390
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,566
Fighting, Jurek. Well done.

391
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,490
You won.

392
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,769
AUTUMN 1943

393
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,242
Hey. - Look what I can.

394
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,088
What's in that bag? - You must hurry.

395
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,810
Clothes and food.

396
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,566
Mrs. Herman ... - Has sent me.

397
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,327
That officer has been replaced. Nobody can protect you.

398
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,481
They can be here any moment.

399
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,044
Too late. That way.

400
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,166
First floor, room 123.

401
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,567
Above, and that way.

402
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,289
Cigarette?

403
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,965
Thanks.

404
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,724
Come on.

405
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,769
There is nobody.

406
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,161
There is nobody?

407
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,722
What does that mean? Then go find him.

408
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,167
I need a phone.

409
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,728
Can you take this guy with the boat?

410
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,325
Where exactly?

411
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,687
As far as possible in that direction.

412
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,525
Good. - Come on.

413
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,083
Jurek, I must return.

414
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,483
On the estate they come you look for first.

415
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,447
Keep your shelter for a while.

416
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,241
Tomorrow they go back behind someone else.

417
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,523
You're the bravest guy I know.

418
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,921
Sit down, son.

419
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,127
Since when is your kind of people so generous?

420
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,651
Are you sure you're a Jew?

421
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,722
Keep it. You may still need him.

422
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,170
What do you want?

423
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,971
Give that boy. That crippled Jew.

424
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,930
I do not know what you mean.

425
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,684
No boy here.

426
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,044
Shut up.

427
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,690
We saw him walk in this village.

428
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,649
Give us that man.

429
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,247
I still say that there is none?

430
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,803
We know all about you, partizan whore.

431
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,164
He is nobody here.

432
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,448
He is somewhere in this village. And you know where.

433
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,206
Steek alles in they got.

434
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,204
In they got. Goed zo.

435
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,089
Do not.

436
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,564
The pigsty, too.

437
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,083
"Flames, wicker on."

438
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,970
I could not make a sound.

439
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,725
What do you have here?

440
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,647
Come with me. Fast.

441
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,648
Is all this because of me?

442
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,090
This is not your fault.

443
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:21,165
They know that we are helping the partisans. That's why they do this.

444
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,244
The other villagers ...

445
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,323
will be upset if ...

446
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,725
I do not know what to say. I'm exhausted.

447
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,770
And I can not give anything more.

448
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,608
Forgive me, please.

449
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,282
You should go.

450
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,611
Do not go back into the forest, Jurek.

451
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,843
There they wait for you probably.

452
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,731
Keep moving.

453
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,680
To the east, where the sun rises.

454
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,524
To the other side of the Vistula.

455
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,926
If you can not go, find a farm ...

456
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,686
and go to work for your food.

457
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:59,088
But do not stay too long in one place, understand?

458
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:03,290
The Russians are coming from the east to expel the Germans.

459
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,250
Are the Russians been here? - No.

460
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,166
Which is good. I was afraid I'd missed them.

461
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,684
My parents moved no more.

462
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,571
Since then I am alone.

463
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,720
A tank drove over my arm.

464
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,807
When the plane came back.

465
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,602
I stuck my hands in the air and they shot my arm off.

466
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,602
Really?

467
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,526
Was it really him? - Did Adolf Hitler cut off your arm?

468
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,842
What's your name? - Jurek. And you?

469
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:32,041
Alina. Where are you from? - Out of the woods.

470
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,880
Do you live in the woods?

471
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,091
What happened to your arm?

472
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,130
So I draw from farm to farm.

473
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,963
Mrs. Herman lived on that farm.

474
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,885
We were threshing and ...

475
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,809
Papa.

476
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,487
Dit is herb.

477
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,891
Praised be Jesus Christ.

478
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,803
Until eternity. Amen.

479
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,046
He lost his arm and looking for work.

480
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,282
He wants to help us.

481
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,966
Have you ever done blacksmith work? - Never.

482
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,169
But if you do, it will succeed me.

483
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,523
Go inside. I'll be right there.

484
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,651
His parents were there and did not move anymore.

485
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,850
A few people took him to a house.

486
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,322
Jurek told me everything about himself ...

487
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,041
how he lost his arm.

488
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,164
Jurek, you should eat something.

489
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,602
Thanks. - You're welcome.

490
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,603
Alina.

491
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,408
Come on.

492
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,083
I want to show you something. - What?

493
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,564
It is beautiful.

494
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,247
It looks crazy from.

495
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,687
Let's go swimming.

496
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,766
If you can not swim with one arm?

497
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,843
Of course.

498
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,961
The first one is in the water wins.

499
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,048
It's cold.

500
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,048
You can never beat me. - Oh no?

501
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,521
Look who's back.

502
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,527
No thanks.

503
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,730
Let us look at the tank.

504
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,771
To find out tank?

505
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,800
What happens there? - The Poles against the Germans.

506
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,247
Why do not you help?

507
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,322
Do you want to be?

508
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,968
Not too tight? - No, he's right.

509
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,804
Just try.

510
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,323
Jurek?

511
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,289
Beautiful branches.

512
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,442
The flowers are gone.

513
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,126
Listen, this spring ...

514
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,080
some children do their first communion.

515
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,930
I think you part of that.

516
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,124
God bless you.

517
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,129
Corpus Christi.
- Amen.

518
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,731
SPRING 1945

519
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,128
Franek.

520
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,964
Take one.

521
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,561
The war is over, it was on the radio. We're going to celebrate.

522
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:32,764
Good afternoon. We drink at the German capitulation.

523
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,003
Why would you? The Russians are no better.

524
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,483
Come on.

525
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,684
Herb.

526
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,249
Alina.

527
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,846
Alina, waar is Jurek?

528
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,923
Do not you hear it?

529
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,370
Smart guy.

530
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,329
Jurek. I have apples.

531
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,127
We talked about him.

532
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,170
Good afternoon.

533
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,407
I Mosche Frenkiel.

534
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,881
I have some paperwork.

535
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,209
What's your name?

536
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,283
Herb Staniak.

537
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,924
Is it true what is written here? That you're a Jew?

538
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,448
No, I am not a Jew. - He is Polish.

539
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,491
His parents are deceased at the beginning of the war.

540
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,881
Your papers.

541
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,691
Come down, we can talk.

542
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,128
Why did you come here with such allegations?

543
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:54,649
Mosche Frenkiel, the Jewish orphanage in Warsaw. It is our stated.

544
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,406
That boy must not live in fear.

545
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,246
I am not a Jew. Leave me alone. - Jurek.

546
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,361
Quiet, you're doing yourself more pain.

547
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,410
These children are the future of our people.

548
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,801
You can not leave them to their fate.

549
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,121
You know very well that you are a Jew.

550
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,045
Do not hide longer. The war is over.

551
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,761
It's time you come back to us again.

552
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,524
I'm not going anywhere.

553
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,887
I want to stay here. Go away.

554
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,886
He says he is not Jewish. Leave him alone.

555
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,562
So you're Polish. Pull your pants down than once.

556
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,850
Go ahead.

557
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,126
The lady can look the other way.

558
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,284
If I am wrong, you never see me back.

559
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,204
Herb.

560
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,002
You do not have to do it.

561
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,689
I had surgery years ago after an accident.

562
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,203
It's true.

563
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,647
You can not take me.

564
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,249
Go inside. Alina.

565
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,125
Hold a moment.

566
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,484
Laat me.

567
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,405
Let me go, I say. I'm not going.

568
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,847
That they may not.

569
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,004
Yes. I've seen the papers.

570
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,448
Is that so? It's just a child.

571
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,448
I'll be back, believe me. I'm not staying there.

572
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,407
Calm down, everything will be fine.

573
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:03,090
Maybe he still has family. We can figure out the best.

574
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,290
Stand still.

575
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,447
Jurek. Stand still.

576
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:26,286
You're not the first person who comes to us with that stuff.

577
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,729
I'm not afraid of you.

578
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,087
Not really? - It has often been shot at me.

579
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,767
I escaped dogs sat in one burning house ...

580
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:51,687
But I'm still alive. I do not lock me up.

581
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,731
I run away yet again. You can let me go as well.

582
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,371
I can not. We need guys like you.

583
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,010
What do you mean "we"?

584
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,730
We Jews.

585
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,167
Your people.

586
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,084
Children of Israel.

587
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:13,007
I do not want to be a Jew. Then I still had my arm.

588
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,127
Perhaps you do not believe me, but I understand you.

589
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:46,160
You are on your own come this far and you want to make your own choices.

590
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,962
Which is good. There I admired.

591
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,088
Really.

592
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:58,406
We want to just show you the way that is right in our view.

593
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,802
For you. For us.

594
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:06,643
And for our persecuted people.

595
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:13,409
If you really want to commit that path is your only choice.

596
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,769
Common.

597
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,524
Jurek?

598
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,284
Is everything alright?

599
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,889
Blonie, where we lived. - Blonie, right.

600
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,931
On the other side of the Kazimierz. Are you from there?

601
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,528
There it is.

602
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,209
Srulik?

603
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,604
You are still alive.

604
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,687
Mosche Frenkiel of the Jewish orphanage in Warsaw.

605
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,524
Eve Staniak. - Staniak?

606
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,041
So I could remember the name. I came here every day.

607
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,364
What name? - He calls himself Jurek Staniak.

608
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,249
Jurek?

609
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,283
That was the name that awful boy that you always bullied.

610
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,603
I was always a treat.

611
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,001
Take it.

612
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,402
Herb Staniak.

613
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,007
Then I could do something for you and your family do.

614
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,810
However small.

615
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,961
May I look around?

616
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,530
The Friedmans had five children.

617
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,521
Srulik was the youngest.

618
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,128
His father was a baker, his mother a seamstress.

619
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:33,606
An older sister and an uncle went to war to Russia.

620
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,650
The rest of the family came in the Warsaw ghetto.

621
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,646
I've never heard of them. Except...

622
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,484
Except what?

623
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,687
A friend from another village ...

624
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:56,561
once said to me that she Srulik had seen his father.

625
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,846
He had apparently escaped from the ghetto ...

626
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,368
and seeking shelter for his family.

627
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,286
But you doubt?

628
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,764
Because of her description. It did not seem to me Mr. Friedman.

629
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,442
Srulik.

630
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,289
Walk on. They are coming.

631
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,528
Srulik?

632
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,205
Papa?

633
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,644
The farmer had seen him here.

634
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,609
Are you sure?

635
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,047
Your mom? And the others?

636
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,169
It's cool, huh? - I do not get sick before my leave.

637
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,721
How long? - Ten days.

638
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:36,331
Boy, you must ... You must be strong and courageous.

639
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,403
You have to survive.

640
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,201
You must survive, you hear?

641
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,250
Never give up, Srulik.

642
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,722
If they send out dogs on you, you hide in the water.

643
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,769
Then they lose your track.

644
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,891
You have to forget your name. You need a Polish name.

645
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,008
Now called you ...

646
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:01,403
Staniak, like the wife of the store.

647
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,210
Will you remember that?

648
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,442
And your name is ...

649
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,807
Jurek? - Yes very good.

650
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,564
That's your new name.

651
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,929
Dus hoe heet them? - Herb Staniak.

652
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,807
I look there.

653
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,927
But even if you have to forget everything ...

654
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,971
your name, and even your mother and me ...

655
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:34,480
you must never forget that you are a Jew, you understand?

656
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,928
Keep secret who you are, but never forget that.

657
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,889
Well, Daddy. I promise.

658
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,605
I'm going to run.

659
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,762
When the soldiers follow me ...

660
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,969
Do you run the other way.

661
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,802
Ren zo lang als je kan.

662
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,645
Do not turn around and keep running.

663
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,841
You're going to make it.

664
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,531
There he is. Stop, Jew.

665
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,170
Srulik?

666
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,963
Right goes to Warsaw and the orphanage.

667
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:05,283
Links attend the Kowalski's. Where do you want to go?

668
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:37,286
When I was 14, I was in an orphanage in Lodz.

669
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,962
Since I did the primary and secondary school ...

670
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:48,283
in half the time it was previously.

671
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,371
I got a scholarship to go to college.

672
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,411
When I was 20, I went to live in a dorm.

673
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,847
I studied mathematics.

674
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,769
In 1962 I immigrated to Israel.

675
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:29,531
There, I met my sister Fajga against whom I had not seen for 30 years.

676
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,524
I became acquainted with her family.

677
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,051
Sonja was love at first sight.

678
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,963
We married ...

679
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:52,282
They had two children: Michal and Zvika.

680
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,162
We have six grandchildren:
