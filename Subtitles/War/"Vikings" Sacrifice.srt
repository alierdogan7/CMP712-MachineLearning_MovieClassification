Ragnar: Every nine years,

36
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:03,411
we travel to the temple
at Uppsala,

37
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,679
to give thanks to the gods

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,616
and to offer them sacrifices
for all they do for us.

39
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:12,620

around here.

44
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:37,945
Then my unborn son
was cruelly taken from me,

45
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,851
and it made me wonder
what I had done

In any case,
I've decided to go.

00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:32,363
How could you be a Christian
and walk among our gods?

361
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,265
I share your appetite
for new adventure,

362
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,067
<i>Ragnar Lothbrok,</i>

363
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:38,269
and I will gladly join forces
with you,

364
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,472
since, as king,
I am naturally not in favor

365
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,541
of individual enterprise

366
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,977
by my earls, or anyone else.

367
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,381
But, believe me,
I will be happy enough

368
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,083
just to have my name
linked with yours

369
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:56,020
when the poets tell the story
of how we norsemen sailed west

370
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,022
and discovered new worlds.

371
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,858

372
00:28:02,261 --> 00:28:05,563

bother to come back?

Hmm.

377
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:27,452
How many women
have you been with?

378
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,721
I don't suppose you know.

379
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:32,457
I do what I want here.

380
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:35,126
I thought we came here
together.

381
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,495
We came here with Earl Ragnar.

382
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,464

together and...

383
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:42,867
we did come here together.

384
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,969
We are together.

385
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,941

not for you,
not for my brother,

389
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,553
not for anyone.

390
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,925
So leave if you want to.

391
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:16,234
But one day
I will be a great man

392
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:17,702
and you'll regret leaving me

393
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:21,172
just because I sleep
with other women.

394
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:41,059
If you really want to be
a great man,

395
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,896
should you not be meeting
with king Horik now?

396
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,064
What do you mean?

397
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:50,334
Siggy: Well, that's where
your brother is now,

398
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:53,137
and no doubt
he's already boasting

399
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,339
about how he sailed west,
alone,

400
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:59,510
and all he has achieved...
Alone.

401
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,980
If you weren't so stubborn
and so drunk,

402
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:06,017
you would be there too,
but you weren't invited.

403
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:09,220
You didn't even know about it.

404
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,224
I could have told you.

405

406
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:19,464

as much as I need you.

I drink to your good fortune.

412
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:46,919
May the gods continue
to favor you

413
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,522
and increase your fame.

414
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:53,626
May they do the same to you,
king Horik.

415
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,628
You have done me the honor
of pledging your fealty,

416
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:56,862
as Earl, to me.

417
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:59,698
Forgive me, then,
if I seem anxious

418
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:03,802
to make use of your skills
and reputation...

419
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,405
As soon as possible.

420
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,809
To do what?

421
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:14,079
There is a Jarl in Gotaland,
Jarl Borg.

422
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:15,314
He is an important fellow,

423
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,917
but he continues to claim
he has legal rights

424
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:20,286
over some of my land.

425
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:21,720
He threatens me.

426
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:24,623
He nearly invaded my territory
a year ago,

427
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,092
but at the last moment
he drew back.

428
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,763
And now, once again,

429
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:34,667
he is making
threatening noises.

430
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:42,675
And how can I be of help
in such a matter?

431
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:49,882
Would you be prepared to travel
to Gotaland as my emissary?

432
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,050
I can think of no one

433
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:52,785
who I would rather
represent my case,

434
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:56,689

435
