They told us to spread out,

the rest of our people.

Soon...

251
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,705
there was no way to tell

who had the cure and who did not....

253
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:17,047
because everyone died.

But other than the U.S. Navy,

255
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:23,353
who had custody of the
cargo once it landed?

256
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:26,389
Could someone have tampered
with the doses on the pier?

257
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,725
No. How can you be so sure?

258
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,660
We delivered to dozens of
countries on this ship.

259

We always worked with
the local partners...

260

I was a local partner, Captain.

261
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,101
My crew was there.

262
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:42,439
We'd made sure everyone received a dose.

263

I was in charge.

264
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:51,047
I was responsible.

265
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:55,152
That's why you wanted those
ships out of Okinawa.

266
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:57,287
That's why you
wanted to punish the people

267

268
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:06,429
But why work with Peng?

269
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:09,166

you were given a military tribunal,

that you authorized to
have your son transported

from a known hot zone in
Michigan down to Florida.

It's public record.

327
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:25,890
The outbreak in Ann
Arbor started after Brian left.

328
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:29,027
Two days after. And the
travel ban was already in effect.

329
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,362
- You knew the risk you were taking.
- No, listen to me, Jacob.

330
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:34,032
The quarantine in the
stadium was porous.

331
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:36,467
Dozens of infected people could and did

332
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:37,769
get through the defenses.

333
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:40,238
That's true, sir,

334
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,441
but it appears that
isn't the way you saw it.

335
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,244
You believe that you
were responsible for the death

336
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,912
of tens of thousands of people.

337
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,747
And if that was your mental condition

338
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,282
when Captain Chandler found you,

339
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,751
then what was your condition when
you took the oath of office

340
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:56,554
a mere 11 days later?

341
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:58,122
I take no pleasure in this, sir.

344
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:02,694

- Out!

00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:45,000
You need to decide if you want
us to give him the cure.

529
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:50,339
I can't force you to trust me.

530
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:52,875
But as a father,

531
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:55,044
I'm telling you,

532
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:57,947
it's the right thing to do.

533
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:09,291
Extracting the fetal head now.

534
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:11,260
- Okay.
- [Speaks Japanese]

535
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:14,063
Good, good, good,
good. Just like that. Okay.

536
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:17,566
- Support the head and neck.
- Yeah. [Panting]

537
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,134
It's a boy.

539
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,572
It's not responsive. Okay,
set it down. Agitate its feet.

540
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:26,375
Just pinch it. Tickle
it. Logan, suction. Now.

541
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:27,609
Okay.

00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,488
Okay.

Give him the cure.

[Crying continues]

555
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,977

Kaito. [Kisses]

565
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:39,988
The Chinese are likely employing

566
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,857
a standard line abreast search pattern

567
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,725
with spacing at 80%
of their radar range.

568
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:44,509
That's right.

569
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,862
My guess is they'll
circle back from open water

570
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:48,997
and close in on us hiding in the pass.

571
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:51,867
And it won't be
long before they find us.

572
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:54,836
Soon as the sun rises, we'll
be completely exposed.

573
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:56,705
So then what are our options?

574
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:59,141
Only one.

575
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,410
Take on all four ships.

576
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:04,946
Wait till their search pattern
brings them back in range,

577
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,015
then break EMCOM and go active.

578
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:08,917
Target, fire, get the
hell out of the way.

579
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:11,753
We'll hit them, but there's no
way they won't hit us back.

580
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:17,025
Well, if it comes to a
fight, we'll sink 'em all.

581
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:18,727
Cameron: At the first
hit on passive radar,

582
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:20,762
the helo and RHIB will
launch simultaneously,

583
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:24,099
each one heading 180
degrees from our course,

584
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:26,401
blasting surface
radar to confuse the enemy.

585
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:28,770
DC Central will be
posted at all zebra boundaries.

586
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,272
First order of business...

587
00:31:30,274 --> 00:31:33,375
report and repair any
damage due to missile attack.

588
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:34,976
Immediately seal all compartments

589
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,245
whose condition threatens the
integrity of this vessel.

590
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:40,382
On my mark, we will break
EMCOM and energize spy radar.

591
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:43,618
We will have no more than
10 seconds to find and kill

592
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,087
each enemy ship.

593
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:47,589
- Are we ready?
- All: Yes, ma'am.

594
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:49,658
Then let's do it how they trained us.

595
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:04,706
Captain, if I'm not mistaken,

596
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,944
your ship is currently positioned
in the Jinhshan Pass.

597
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,814
You have evaded the
Chinese for the moment,

598
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:16,685
but soon, they will have you surrounded.

599
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:19,221
You intend to fight them all at once?

600
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:23,592
I have a better plan,

601
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:25,961
but we must hurry.

602
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:35,971
CNO on the Bridge. Captain
on the Bridge.

603
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:11,706
This is the safest way out
of this island group.

604
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,508
You're certain?

605
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:18,280
[Inhales deeply]

606
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:20,682
OOD, come to course
1-2-5. All ahead flank.

607
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:24,886
Aye, sir. Helm, make
course 1-2-5, all ahead flank.

608
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,790
[Whispers] Aye, sir.

609
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,844
[Beeping]

610
00:33:48,846 --> 00:33:51,613
TAO, Surface, reporting two...

611
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:53,148
correction, we have three,

612
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,617
say again, three contacts on passive.

613
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,220
Bridge, CIC, we're surrounded again.

614
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:00,589
<i>Slick 32 has three
vessels on passive radar.</i>

615
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:01,990
Sir, I recommend we head due south

616
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:03,959
to the Zhulong Atoll for protection.

617
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,294
This was part of the plan, I take it?

618
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:10,198
Maintain course and speed.

619
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,533
Keep her so.

620
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:13,969
Gator: Sir, we are
heading directly into open water.

621
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,570
Once they have a clear path,

622
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:18,106
they can triangulate and
fire on us almost immediately.

623
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:21,610
I strongly recommend we set course 0-5-5.

624
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:22,504
Considered.

625
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,246
CIC detects the fourth
ship on passive, sir.

626
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:26,648
- They engage fire control?
- Negative, sir.

627
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,250
Prepare countermeasures.

628
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:30,151
Stop. Stop engines!

629
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:31,486
All stop.

00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:57,646

All four targets are converging
on us, sir. We cannot turn back.

637
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,694
This is my minefield.

638
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,462
I designed it.

639
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:15,897
I know how those mines operate.

640
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:18,867
I can steer us to safety.

641
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:21,603
There is no other option.

642
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,510
Surrender the helm.

00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:47,988
tried to wipe us both out.

708
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,860
I was told how to find
you in Vietnam by a smuggler.

709
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:57,798
And what was his cut of a
bunch of American sailors?

710
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,100
Just a promise

711
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:03,570
that I would not pirate certain ships.

712
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,942
Ones marked...

713
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:11,078
like this.

714
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,313
What's so special about those ships?

715
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:15,149
I did not care to ask.

716
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,251
At the time,

717
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:20,521
all I wanted was revenge.

718
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:25,259
This smuggler have a name?

719
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,696
Wu Ming.

720
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:35,702
Ring a bell?

721
00:40:35,704 --> 00:40:37,438
He has my watch.

722
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,376
I know where to find him...
a place called Shanzhai.

723
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:49,316
We clear to broadcast?

724
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,251
EMCON Alpha has been lifted.

725
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:53,053
You have St. Louis.

726
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,955
Stand by for CNO.

727
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:57,224
This is CNO.

728
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:58,725
We got him.

729
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:05,547
- I need to see the President.
- Sorry, ma'am, no visitors tonight.

730
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:07,634
He's not answering his phone.
I have word from Nathan James.

731
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:09,670
Those are our orders. I'm sorry.

732
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:12,005
Agent Costas, I am the
Deputy Chief of Staff

733
00:41:12,007 --> 00:41:13,507
and I am issuing you a direct order.

734
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:15,075
Open this door.

735
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,315
- [Keypad beeps]
- [Knocks]

736
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,753
- [Knocks]
- Mr. President?

737
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,095
- [Exhales]
- [Phone thuds]

738
