500 
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,078 
-By The question someone would be mistreated. 
 -Not, never.  

501 
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,037 
Alone went a Jew.  

502 
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,556 
does Not fail like this.  I am not you recognizing.  

503 
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,673
 we Go there.  

504 
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,714 
I like to live in a beautiful house.  

505 
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,198 
I also.  

506 
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,795 
Would Like that our son went for the university.  

507 
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,958 
I also.  

508 
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,150
 ...Por that the Jews were the that had right to everything?  

509 
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,790 
Because the French law is for them and not for us?  

510 
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,751
 While this land is ours!  

511 
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,031
 You find this normal?  It finds?  

512 
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,912 
They also are in their country, and healthy poor as we.  

513 
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,719 
is Not truth.  

514 
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,397 
You know about nothing.  You did not read.  

515 
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,155 
what should I read for understand?  

516 
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,836 
IS difficult of read.  His French is not good enough.  

517 
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,712
 Read the Koran.  


518 
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,792

distant...  

521 
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,394

522 
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,275 
-You know that do not I know to walk.

523 
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,836

Imagines in his place.  Before, he did not have work

532
 01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,110 
because we are a country explored.  

533 
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,554 
The French alone explore us, and you, Jewish, do nothing.  

534 
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,912 
Steal our wealth, our work.  By that you go to the school and I not?  

535 
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,873 
By that I use a veil and you not?  

536 
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,519 
By that you can leave without that nobody do comments

537 
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,792
 and I... for me they always speak something!  

538 
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,550 
Because I cannot leave?  Why?

540 
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,997 
-Because is the truth. 
 -It is not.
