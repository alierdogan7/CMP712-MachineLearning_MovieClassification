1
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,183
Let me put up this next memo.

2
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:55,286
You want me to read this?

3
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,755
Yes, please.

4
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:01,693
"February 4, 2004.

5
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:06,564
Subject: What you know.

6
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,467
There are known knowns.

7
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:13,204
There are known unknowns.

8
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:16,875
There are unknown unknowns.

9
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:21,916
But there are also
unknown knowns.

10
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:28,452
That is to say,
things that you think you know

11
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:31,561
that it turns out
you did not."

12
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,953
<i>I wonder if in the future</i>

13
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:13,693
<i>public figures will write
as many memos as I did.</i>

14
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:18,963
<i>I doubt it.</i>

15
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,001
<i>I must have gotten
in the habit of dictating</i>

16
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,602
<i>things that were important.</i>

17
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:25,936
<i>Not a diary.</i>

18
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:28,506
<i>Not a journal.</i>

19
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,507
They're almost all
working documents.

20
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:33,811
Now, they've become historical
documents in retrospect,

21
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:37,281
but at the time,
they all had a purpose.

22
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:40,952
In the later years
of my using the dictaphone,

23
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,620
why, they were called
snowflakes,

24
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:45,490
because they were
on white paper.

25
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,393
<i>What would you say
the total number of memos</i>

26
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,894
<i>might be?</i>

27
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:52,530
<i>They said I dictated 20,000</i>

28
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,032
<i>just in the last six years
at the Pentagon.</i>

29
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,741
<i>There have to be millions.</i>

30
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,942
<i>"July 27, 2001."</i>

31
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:10,915
<i>A memo to Condoleezza Rice
concerning Iraq.</i>

32
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:15,053
<i>"We have discussed Iraq
on a number of occasions.</i>

33
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:18,556
<i>The discussions
have been inconclusive.</i>

34
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,491
<i>Sanctions are being limited</i>

35
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:25,429
<i>in a way that cannot weaken
Saddam Hussein.</i>

36
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,066
<i>We can publicly acknowledge
that the sanctions don't work</i>

37
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,469
<i>over extended periods
and stop the pretense</i>

38
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,110
<i>of having a policy
that is keeping Saddam</i>

39
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:37,508
<i>'in the box'
when we know he has crawled</i>

40
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,945
<i>a good distance out of the box.</i>

41
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,547
<i>Within a few years,</i>

42
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,228
<i>the U.S. will undoubtedly
have to confront</i>

43
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:48,959
<i>a Saddam armed
with nuclear weapons.</i>

44
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,462
<i>If Saddam's regime
were oustered,</i>

45
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,597
<i>we would have
a much-improved position</i>

46
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,398
<i>in the region
and elsewhere."</i>

47
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:17,381
<i>Why the obsession
with Iraq and Saddam?</i>

48
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,717
Well, you love that word,
"obsession."

49
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,653
I can see the glow
in your face when you say it.

50
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:23,955
Well, I'm an obsessive person.

51
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,489
Are you? I'm not.

52
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,958
I'm--
I'm cool.

53
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,859
I'm measured.

54
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,796
<i>If you look
at the range of my memos,</i>

55
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:35,665
<i>there might be 1/10 of 1%
about Iraq.</i>

56
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,467
The reason I was concerned
about Iraq

57
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:40,804
is 'cause four-star generals
would come to me and say,

58
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:44,409
"Mr. secretary,
we have a problem.

59
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,477
Our orders are to fly over
the northern part of Iraq

60
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,047
and the Southern part of Iraq
on a daily basis,

61
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,618
with the Brits,
and we are getting shot at.

62
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,953
At some moment--
could be tomorrow,

63
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,054
could be next month,
could be next year--

64
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,124
one of our planes
is gonna be shot down

65
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,828
and our pilots and crews
are gonna be killed

66
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,830
or they're gonna be
captured."

67
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,498
The question will be,

68
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,701
"what in the world were
we flying those flights for?

69
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,837
What was
the cost-benefit ratio?

70
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,871
What was our country gaining?"

71
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,207
So you sit down and you say,

72
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,809
"I think I'm gonna see

73
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,609
if I can get
the president's attention.

74
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,912
Remind him that our planes
are being shot at,

75
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:25,148
remind him that we don't have
a fresh policy for Iraq,

76
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:30,054
and remind him that we've got
a whole range of options."

77
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,455
Not an obsession.

78
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:36,527
A very measured,
nuanced approach,

79
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:39,867
I think.

80
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:45,869
<i>In my confirmation hearing</i>

81
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,107
<i>when I was nominated
to be secretary of defense,</i>

82
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,011
<i>the best question
I was asked was,</i>

83
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,881
"what do you worry about
when you go to bed at night?"

84
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:59,516
And my answer was, in effect,

85
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:00,751
"intelligence.

86
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,720
The danger
that we can be surprised

87
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,922
because of
a failure of imagining

88
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,862
what might happen
in the world."

89
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:14,898
<i>There are known knowns,
the things we know we know.</i>

90
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,234
<i>There are known unknowns,</i>

91
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:20,071
<i>the things we know
we don't know.</i>

92
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,472
<i>There are also
that third category</i>

93
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,607
<i>of unknown unknowns,</i>

94
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,910
<i>the things we don't know
we don't know.</i>

95
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,213
<i>And you can only know more
about those things</i>

96
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:32,987
<i>by imagining what they might be.</i>

97
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:41,993
<i>Pearl harbor was
a failure of imagination.</i>

98
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,160
<i>We didn't know we didn't know</i>

99
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,803
<i>that they could do what they
did the way they did it.</i>

100
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:55,172
<i>We had people working
on breaking codes.</i>

101
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,073
<i>We had people thinking through,</i>

102
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,980
<i>"what are the kinds of things
they might do?"</i>

103
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,016
<i>And lo and behold,
the carriers were able to,</i>

104
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,953
<i>on a Sunday morning,
get very close to Hawaii,</i>

105
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:13,994
<i>launch their planes, and
impose enormous destruction.</i>

106
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,275
Was it failure of imagination

107
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:35,079
or failure to look
at the intelligence

108
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,215
that was available?

109
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,649
They had thought through

110
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,653
a great many
more obvious possibilities.

111
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:47,992
<i>People were chasing
the wrong rabbit.</i>

112
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:51,362
<i>That one possibility
was not something</i>

113
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:55,270
<i>that they had imagined
was likely.</i>

114
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,239
<i>"July 23, 2001.</i>

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,114
<i>in some future hearing,</i>

117
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,783
<i>I am going to say
that I do not want</i>

118
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:17,787
<i>to be sitting before this panel</i>

119
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:22,726

<i>Who didn't do what,

121
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:31,869
<i>None of us would want
to have to be back here</i>

122

<i>going through that agony."</i>

123
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:39,944
A month or so before
September 11, 2001,

124
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:44,181
it would be wrong to think
that someone who wrote it--

125
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,282
namely me, was prescient.

126
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,384
I wasn't.

127
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,954
I simply had read enough history

128
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,792
that I worried.

129
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,225
<i>American 11, climb,</i>

130
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:58,995

131
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,436
<i>American 11, climb,

132
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,341
<i>American 11, Boston.</i>

133
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:11,679
<i>The American on the frequency,

134
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,279
<i>American 11,
if you hear Boston center</i>

135
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,450
<i>re-contact Boston center
on 127.82.</i>

136
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:22,291
<i>That's American 11, 127.82.</i>

137
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,792
My military assistant,

138
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,427
admiral Ed Giambastiani,
came in and said,

139
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:33,431
"a plane has hit
the world trade center."

140
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,300
It was assumed
to be an accident.

141
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:39,369
And I went into my office
from the conference room,

142
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,490
and admiral Giambastiani said,
"another plane has hit

143
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,074
the other world
trade center tower."

144
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,441
And of course, at that point,

145
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,076
it wasn't an accident;
It was an attack.

146
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:50,751
Within minutes,
I felt the Pentagon shake.

147
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:57,388
<i>That's how our day began
on September 11th.</i>

148
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,766
They had hit the center
of economic power in New York,

149
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:12,135
and they then had hit
the center of military power

150
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,336
at the Pentagon.

151
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:15,239
You need to find out
what had happened.

152
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,874
What was it?

153
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,442
I got up and
went down the hall, and--

154
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,745
on my floor,
until the smoke was so bad

155
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,279
I had to get outside.

156
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,050
Then I went downstairs and
outside and around the corner,

157
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:29,119
and here were pieces of
that American airlines airplane

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,493
just spread all over the apron,
all over the grass.

159
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,826
<i>Flames and smoke,</i>

160
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,896
<i>people being brought out
of the building</i>

161
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:42,068
<i>who were injured
and burned and wounded.</i>

162
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,369
<i>The first responders
really hadn't arrived yet.</i>

163
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,147
<i>There were
very few people there.</i>

164
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,215
<i>How do you think
that they got away with 9/11?</i>

165
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:01,121
It seems amazing in retrospect.

166
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:07,490
Everything seems amazing
in retrospect.

167
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:10,465
Pearl harbor seems amazing
in retrospect.

168
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:16,139
<i>It's a failure of imagination.</i>

169
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:28,144
<i>It's not as though you aren't
aware of possibilities,</i>

170
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:31,581
<i>but you tend to favor
some possibilities</i>

171
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,321
<i>more than others.</i>

172
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:39,322
<i>And it's enormously important
to have priorities.</i>

173
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,590

174
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,058
<i>What is it you want to do?</i>

175
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,459
<i>What are you gonna
be prepared for?</i>

176
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,994
<i>And you have to pick and choose.</i>

177
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,596
<i>Well, to the extent
you pick and choose</i>

178
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:48,231
<i>and you're wrong...</i>

179
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,275
<i>...the penalty can be enormous.</i>

00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,327
<i>and to free themselves

188
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,080

<i>of the Taliban regime
in Afghanistan.</i>

203
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,316
In relatively short order,
a matter of weeks,

204
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,584
Kabul was occupied,

205
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,186
the Taliban was defeated

206
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:52,221
and run out of the country
in large measure,

207
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:54,659
and a lot of Al-Qaeda
were killed.

208
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:00,397
<i>Osama Bin Laden escaped
into Pakistan eventually.</i>

209
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:03,466
<i>The target of the
largest manhunt in history</i>

210
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,034
<i>still eludes capture.</i>

211
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,637
<i>Cave by cave, for any sign</i>

212
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,038
<i>of Osama Bin Laden,
dead or alive.</i>

213
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:12,042
<i>The high probability that
Osama Bin Laden is still alive.</i>

214
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,077
<i>With Afghanistan's
porous borders,</i>

215
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,412
<i>it's possible Bin Laden
has already slipped</i>

216
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,388
<i>out of the country.</i>

217
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:29,158
<i>Osama gets away,
and a confusion sets in.</i>

218
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,565
<i>People began to think
that Saddam was connected</i>

219
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,268
with Al-Qaeda and with 9/11.

220
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,119
Oh, I don't think so.

221
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:45,042
It was very clear that
the direct planning for 9/11

222
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,710
was done by
Osama Bin Laden's people,

223
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,547
Al-Qaeda,
and in Afghanistan.

224
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,082
I don't think
the American people

225
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,252
were confused about that.

226
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:59,723
<i>In 2003,
in a Washington Post poll,</i>

227
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:02,158
69% said they believe
it is likely

228
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,561
the Iraqi leader
was personally involved

229
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:07,764
in the attacks
carried out by Al-Qaeda.

230
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:11,435
I don't remember anyone
in the bush administration

231
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,403
saying anything like that,

232
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:16,739
nor do I recall
anyone believing that.

233
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,143
Mr. secretary, today
in a broadcast interview was--

234
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,646
Saddam Hussein said,
"there is only one truth.

235
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:26,282
Iraq has no weapons
of mass destruction whatsoever."

236
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,451
And he went on to say,

237
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:29,052
"I would like to tell you
directly

238
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:31,754
we have no relationship
with Al-Qaeda."

239
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:34,624
And Abraham Lincoln was short.

240
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,295
Would you care
to respond directly

241
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:41,403
to what Saddam Hussein
has said today?

242
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:47,504
I--

243
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:50,273
how does one respond to that?

244
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:53,277
It's just a continuous pattern.

245
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,147
This is a case of the local liar
coming up again

246
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,481
and people repeating
what he said

247
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,817
and forgetting to say
that he never--

248
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:05,154
almost never--
rarely tells the truth.

249
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,799
<i>There are two sides to the coin.</i>

250
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,470
<i>One is,</i>

251
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,605
<i>"belief in the inevitability
of conflict</i>

252
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:27,376
<i>can become one
of its main causes."</i>

253
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:31,147
<i>That is a truth.</i>

254
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:34,785
<i>The other side of the coin,
which is also true, is,</i>

255
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:38,125
<i>"if you wish for peace,
prepare for war."</i>

256
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,526
<i>But if both were true,</i>

257
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:46,697
<i>well, you can use that
to justify anything.</i>

258
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,799
There's a similar thing
in Rumsfeld’s rules

259
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,169
where I say,

260
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,440
"all generalizations are false,

261
00:17:56,441 --> 00:18:00,410
including this one."

262
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:03,650
There it is.

263
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,918
<i>The president did
harden his stand towards--</i>

264
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,653
<i>the United States
is on the road to war.</i>

265
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,588
<i>Administration
officials say the effort</i>

266
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,758
<i>to pressure Iraq has moved
into a final phase.</i>

267
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,927
<i>All the military pieces
should be in place</i>

268
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,170
<i>to go to war with Iraq.</i>

269
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,837
<i>On January 11, 2003,</i>

270
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:30,440
<i>the vice president's office
called</i>

271
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,808
<i>and requested that I come over
to meet with him</i>

272
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:37,847
<i>and the Saudi ambassador,
prince Bandar.</i>

273
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,549
It was unusual.
I mean, I--

274
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,486
I wasn't often
in the vice president's office.

275
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:43,620
We sat down.

276
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:47,723
Dick proceeded to tell Bandar

277
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:51,929
that the president
was going to invade Iraq

278
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,431
and change the regime in Iraq.

279
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:57,834
That was the first time
that I'd heard anything

280
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,269
that sounded truly definitive.

281
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,739
What was the Saudi
ambassador's reaction to this?

282
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,977
He wanted reassurance
that when it was all over,

283
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,212
Saddam Hussein would be gone.

284
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,847
They needed to know
that the president was serious.

285
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,482
That is why, I'm sure,

286
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:16,787
the vice president said it
the way he said it.

287
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,222
Is it at all strange
that you would hear about it

288
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:20,824
in this way?

289
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,994
No.

290
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:26,266
No, I don't think so.

291
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:32,768
<i>If the purpose of the war
is to get rid of Saddam Hussein,</i>

292
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:34,249
<i>why can't they just
assassinate him?</i>

293
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:38,342
<i>Why do you have
to invade his country?</i>

294
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,543
Who's "they?"

295
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:40,394
Us.

296
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,379
You said, "they."

297
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,579
You didn't say, "we."

298
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,780
Well, "we."

299
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:45,631
I will rephrase it.

300
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,057
Why do we have to do that?

301
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,992
We don't assassinate
leaders of other countries.

302
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:58,327
Well, Dora Farms,
we were doing our best.

303
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:01,037
That was an act of war.

304
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,437
<i>The beginning of the war,</i>

305
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:10,507
<i>even before it started,</i>

306
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,477
George tenet came to see me
in my office at the Pentagon.

307
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,646
He said, "we think we know
where Saddam Hussein is."

308
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,649
I said, "terrific,"
and I called the White House

309
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,717
and said to the president,
"we're coming over."

310
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,958
<i>We met in his office.</i>

311
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,691
George tenet would go
from the oval office

312
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,761
in to a side office
and talk to the people

313
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:33,864
in the central
intelligence agency

314
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:38,934
who were talking to the agents
on the ground in Iraq.

315
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:40,437
The word came back

316
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:43,373
that somebody had identified
Saddam Hussein

317
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,877
as being at Dora Farms.

318
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:51,647
<i>George tenet was convinced
that his people on the ground</i>

319
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:53,416
were giving him
the straight dope.

320
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,085
They were certain he was there.

321
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:02,027
<i>We'd put on alert aircraft.</i>

322
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:08,569
<i>The aircraft took off
and went to that location.</i>

323
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,404
The president
went around the room asking,

324
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,574
"should we do this
or not?"

325
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:18,935
Everyone in the room,
as I recall,

326
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,978
agreed it was
sufficiently solid intelligence,

327
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,447
sufficient to do it.

328
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,847
We just were so hopeful

329
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,783
that by killing Saddam Hussein,

330
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:30,987
we could end the need for a war,

331
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:34,130
that in fact, by that act,
you would change the regime.

332
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,865
<i>The planes went in,
and they struck the farm...</i>

333
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,040
<i>...killed some people.</i>

334
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,509
They came out
with a stretcher with a body.

335
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,479
People there
on the ground asserted

336
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,382
that it was Saddam Hussein.

337
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,518
They think they killed him.

338
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,122
And it turned out, it was not.

339
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,694
<i>What a wonderful
thing it would have been</i>

340
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:14,730
<i>if he could have been killed.</i>

341
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:18,434
The war would have been avoided.

342
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:19,669
It's possible.

343
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,137
May not have been,

344
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:22,775
but it's possible.

345
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:37,754
<i>You wonder why
they didn't respond</i>

346
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:39,689
<i>to all the efforts
that were made</i>

347
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,893
<i>to avoid that war.</i>

348
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:45,996
<i>How could they be that mixed up</i>

349
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,969
<i>in what the inevitable
next steps would be?</i>

350
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:53,836
<i>Why they wouldn't sit down</i>

351
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:57,606
<i>and have
an agonizing reappraisal,</i>

352
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:01,444
<i>and it come to some
logical conclusion?</i>

353
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:29,239
<i>I was elected to congress.</i>

354
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,074
<i>I was 30 years old.</i>

355
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:35,679
<i>It was during the Vietnam war
and the civil rights era.</i>

356
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,516
<i>There were big issues before us.</i>

357
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,550
I would come back sometimes

358
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,254
knowing I didn't know
if I voted right,

359
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:46,922
that there are arguments here
and there were arguments there.

360
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:49,492
"Ugh, I hope I voted
the right way.

361
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:50,493
Why did I do what I did?"

362
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:54,764
And I'd sit down
and dictate that.

363
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,900
<i>After almost every vote,
every amendment,</i>

364
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:01,203
<i>I would go back
with my little dictaphone.</i>

365
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:03,772
I would dictate a note and say,

366
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:05,040
"here was the vote.

367
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,876
The ayes were this.
The nays were that.

368
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:08,845
Here were the amendments,
and here's what I did

369
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:11,181
and why I did it."

370
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:14,183
<i>And then when I went
in the executive branch,</i>

371
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:18,121
<i>I would want to clarify
my own thinking,</i>

372
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,162
so I would try to put it down
on paper and edit it,

373
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:23,259
and I'd go through
three, four, five drafts,

374
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,528
getting it the way
I really wanted it.

375
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,765
I would do it
for communications to my staff.

376
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,835
I wanted them to know
what I was thinking.

377
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:34,304
Did you imagine
that they would produce

378
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:35,872
this vast archive?

379
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:37,239
Oh, it never crossed my mind.

380
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,643
I never knew
what I was gonna do next.

381
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,764
The only thing I've ever
volunteered for in my life--

382
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,813
one was to go in the Navy,

383
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:46,916
and the other was
to run for congress.

384
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,718
The other was to get married.

385
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,331
<i>You look at being
married to the same woman</i>

386
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,967
<i>all those decades--</i>

387
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:07,136
<i>when you're 20, 21, 22,</i>

388
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:10,105
<i>what did you know?</i>

389
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:13,276
Both of us were young
and unformed.

390
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:16,313
How in the world
can you be that lucky?

391
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,181
How did you propose?

392
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:20,686
Imperfectly.

393
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:27,723
<i>I was getting ready
to leave for Pensacola.</i>

394
00:25:27,724 --> 00:25:29,726
About 10:00 in the morning,
I said to my folks,

395
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:30,960
"I'll be back.

396
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,063
I'm gonna go down
and see Joyce."

397
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,364
I asked her to marry me.

398
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:35,798
I didn't get down on my knees.

399
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,933
I didn't do anything fancy.

400
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:39,835
I didn't want to get married,

401
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:41,671
but I sure as heck
didn't want her

402
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:43,772
to marry anyone else.

403
00:25:43,773 --> 00:25:46,108
And I was correct.

404
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,030
It was a good decision.

405
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:50,349
It just hadn't been
part of my plan.

406
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,188
<i>Director of the
office of economic opportunity</i>

407
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,760
<i>was Rumsfeld’s first job
for Richard Nixon.</i>

408
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,363
<i>Later, when O.E.O. Seemed
headed for extinction,</i>

409
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:10,836
<i>Mr. Nixon named him director
of the cost of living council.</i>

410
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,103
<i>After friction developed</i>

411
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,404
<i>between Rumsfeld
and H.R. Haldeman,</i>

412
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:18,708
<i>Rumsfeld requested a change</i>

413
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,310
<i>and was sent to Brussels
as the U.S. ambassador</i>

414
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:24,413
<i>to the north Atlantic
treaty organization.</i>

415
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:26,082
<i>He got out just in time</i>

416
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,221
<i>and survived Watergate
with reputation intact.</i>

417
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:34,790
<i>A person who works
that hard to become president</i>

418
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,961
<i>had to believe that
everything he did or thought</i>

419
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:43,833
<i>would be useful to preserve.</i>

420
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:46,135
He puts in place
these recording devices,

421
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:48,738
like other presidents had,

422
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,306
and then he'd go about
being himself,

423
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,107
and sometimes
he'd let his hair down

424
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:56,046
and say things in ways
that he might not have said

425
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,082
had he remembered
that each second of the day

426
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,683
that it was being recorded.

427
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:02,986
All of us say things
we shouldn't say,

428
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:05,922
that on reflection,
we wish we hadn't said.

429
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,725
I expect he just felt that
on balance,

430
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:10,160
everything was worth preserving

431
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,099
because he was
an historic figure.

432
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,918
<i>Did presidents after
Nixon make recordings</i>

433
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:10,319
<i>in the White House?</i>

434
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,387
The only president
I was close enough to

435
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:14,824
to answer that question about
was Gerald R. Ford,

436
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,360
and I can assure you he did not.

437
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:21,064
My guess is that people
tend not to fall

438
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,199
in exactly the same potholes

439
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,003
that their predecessors do.

440
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:29,772
More often than not,
they make original mistakes.

441
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:31,775
We all do.

442
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,345
<i>But I assume the presidency
under extraordinary...</i>

443
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:39,249
<i>Gerald Ford had announced,
when he first took office,</i>

444
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,286
<i>that he was not gonna have
a chief of staff.</i>

445
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:45,521
He was going to be
the anti-Nixon,

446
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:49,358
the anti-Haldeman,
the anti-Ehrlichman.

447
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,928
He had said he was
gonna have a coordinator

448
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:53,797
or something like that.

449
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,879
<i>And that's when I told him</i>

450
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:56,311
<i>he'd have to find somebody else,</i>

451
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:57,933
<i>because it wasn't gonna work,</i>

452
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:01,237
<i>and I didn't want
to be a party to it.</i>

453
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:05,112
<i>After a while,
he agreed that I was right.</i>

454
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:10,246
<i>At the time,
there were a number of people</i>

455
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:13,348
<i>still being looked at
by what was then called,</i>

456
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:17,854
<i>"the special prosecutor."</i>

457
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,123
This is really
an extraordinary moment.

458
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:25,194
The White House is filled
with lawyers and investigators.

459
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,865
That's exactly right.

460
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:32,501
<i>It was September 29, 1974,</i>

461
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:35,070
<i>in the morning
that I dictated this memo</i>

462
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:38,477
<i>on the subject of the safe
in the chief of staff's office.</i>

463
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:44,180
<i>"I arrived
at approximately 5:00 P.M.</i>

464
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:47,018
<i>I wanted to clean out the
place so that I could move in,</i>

465
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:50,553
<i>and I wanted to make sure that
there was nothing in the place</i>

466
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:52,354
<i>that I didn't want there,</i>

467
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:57,527
<i>such as recording equipment,
telephone bugs, and the like.</i>

468
00:29:57,528 --> 00:30:00,095
<i>At approximately 5:15 P.M.,</i>

469
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:03,066
<i>bill Walker commented
that there was a safe</i>

470
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,067
<i>in the cupboard."</i>

471
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:08,006
<i>This says, "to the left
of the fireplace."</i>

472
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,472
If you're standing
in the fireplace,

473
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:11,874
it was to the left.

474
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,108
Actually, it was to the right

475
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:14,576
if you faced the fireplace.

476
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,456
So here's a safe,
and it's locked.

477
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,892
And I thought, "oh, my goodness.

478
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,894
I wonder
what's in that safe?"

479
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:33,563
I said to Dick Cheney,

480
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:35,464
my assistant who was helping me,

481
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:37,533
"look, why don't we get
the secret service,

482
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:40,403
get 'em down here with people
who can move the safe

483
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:42,905
and open it
or do whatever they have to do."

484
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:45,107
And what happened
to the safe in the end?

485
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:48,143
The end for me was when
I got it out of my office

486
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:52,081
under a proper
chain of evidence.

499
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:50,973
<i>The north Vietnamese

<i>directly towards

502
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,552
The scenes of the helicopter

503
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,054
lifting people off
of the roof of the building

504
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,255
were really heartbreaking,

505
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:08,191
because you had
really wonderful people

506
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,360
who'd worked with our forces

507
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,495
and knew that their circumstance

508
00:32:12,496 --> 00:32:14,596
when the Vietcong
and north Vietnamese

509
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:17,266
took over that country
would be difficult,

510
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:20,268
that they'd be killed
or put in jail.

511
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,709
They kept lifting
more and more out,

512
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,309
and more kept coming.

513
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:28,310
<i>They ended up landing
so many helicopters</i>

514
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,314
<i>on the carrier that they
started shoving helicopters off</i>

515
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:34,616
<i>so that they could get
more helicopters on.</i>

516
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,634
Were you with the president
when all of this was going down?

517
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:55,570
Yes, I was in the oval office

518
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:58,173
<i>with secretary Kissinger
and the president</i>

519
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:01,781
<i>and other close aides
to the president.</i>

520
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:08,186
It was a day anyone involved
will never forget.

521
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:17,059
The inevitable ugly ending
of an unsuccessful effort.

522
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,532
Do you think that there's
a lesson to be taken from this?

523
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:24,333
Well, one would hope
that most things

524
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:28,171
that happen in life
prove to be lessons.

525
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,372
Some things work out.

526
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,710
Some things don't.
That didn't.

527
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,363
<i>If that's a lesson--
yes, it's a lesson.</i>

528
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:56,298
<i>President Gerald Ford
had given a talk</i>

529
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,433
<i>to a labor group.</i>

530
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,741
<i>He went out the back,</i>

531
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:10,446
<i>and we went into
a freight elevator.</i>

532
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,180
The doors went open,

533
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,482
we walked out,

534
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:16,718
and the top door came back down,

535
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,323
and it hit Gerald Ford
right across the forehead.

536
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:25,328
And he ended up with a cut
about an inch and a half wide.

537
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,163
<i>Of course, at that moment,
Chevy chase and these people</i>

538
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:30,232
<i>were talking about Ford
bumping his head</i>

539
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,773
<i>or stumbling.</i>

540
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:40,243
So we went up in the room
and the doctor started

541
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,678
putting powder on it
to see if he could calm it down

542
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,348
so it didn't look like
a neon sign.

543
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,415
<i>It came time to leave.</i>

544
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,785
<i>He waved and shook hands.</i>

545
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:53,221
<i>Got out to the street corner...</i>

546
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:55,725
<i>A shot rang out.</i>

547
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:01,163
<i>Sara Jane Moore
was across the street,</i>

548
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:02,603
<i>fired a bullet.</i>

549
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,870
<i>It went by his head,</i>

550
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,372
<i>by the secret service
guy's head,</i>

551
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:13,209
<i>by my head.</i>

552
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:18,281
<i>A matter of inches
from both of us.</i>

553
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:22,618
We got in the car,

554
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,486
pushed him down
on the floor, and...

555
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:26,656
Secret service man on top,
I'm on top.

556
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,857
The car races out of the city...

557
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:32,962
<i>...not knowing
what might be next.</i>

558
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:34,930
<i>Finally you hear
this muffled thing</i>

559
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,665
from president Ford,
and he says,

560
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:37,799
"come on, you guys.

561
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,267
Get off.
You're heavy."

562
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:41,404
And so we sat up,

563
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:45,876
went to the airplane, and left.

564
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,810
<i>I used to tease him and say</i>

565
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:53,316
<i>I hoped he appreciated fully
how I handled his departure</i>

566
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,817
from the hotel in San Francisco.

567
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:57,252
No one ever noticed

568
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:59,965
that he had the neon sign
on his forehead.

569
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,801
<i>"Mr. President,
I care a great deal</i>

570
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,437
<i>about you as a person
and about your success.</i>

571
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:18,741
<i>I care deeply about the country</i>

572
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,243
<i>and believe
it is vitally important</i>

573
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:23,578
<i>that you be re-elected.</i>

574
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,350
<i>The morale is low
in the White House</i>

575
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,757
<i>because of the organizational
approach you have tolerated.</i>

576
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:37,692
<i>The job you need done
cannot be done</i>

577
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:40,501
<i>unless major changes
take place."</i>

578
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:47,303
<i>Dick Cheney and I
both attached our resignations</i>

579
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:50,739
<i>to the memo.</i>

580
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,575
There wasn't anything
in the memo

581
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:54,616
I hadn't talked to him about
four, five, six times.

582
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:57,312
I decided that putting it down
in one place,

583
00:36:57,313 --> 00:36:58,848
deciding to resign,

584
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,987
causing him to register
how strongly we felt about it.

585
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:07,522
<i>He ended up separating
the positions</i>

586
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:11,294
<i>of secretary of state
and national security advisor,</i>

587
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,729
<i>which Henry had held
both of them.</i>

588
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,799
<i>And he made
several other changes.</i>

589
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,368
<i>Put George Herbert Walker bush</i>

590
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,638
<i>in the central
intelligence agency.</i>

591
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,508
<i>He wanted to make a change
at the Pentagon,</i>

592
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,944
<i>asked me to become
secretary of defense,</i>

593
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:33,448
<i>then my deputy, Dick Cheney,
to become chief of staff.</i>

594
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:37,687
Of course, this becomes
known as the Halloween massacre.

595
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,888
Oh.

596
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,723
I guess it is.

597
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,991
You know, a narrative
gets built out there

598
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,727
over a period of time.

599
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,997
Big personalities
going at each other.

600
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:50,700
In fact,
it's perfectly understandable.

601
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,468
They represent
different institutions,

602
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:53,949
and they have
different perspectives.

603
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:55,837
But it gets written up
in the media

604
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,874
as though it's jealousies
and personalities

605
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,643
and that type of thing
as opposed to

606
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:03,349
different perspectives.

607
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,718
<i>When Shakespeare wrote history,</i>

608
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,756
<i>it was all character defects,
jealousies,</i>

609
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,926
<i>misunderstandings,</i>

610
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,662
<i>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</i>

611
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:22,497
<i>In Shakespeare,
it's the motivating force</i>

612
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:23,348
<i>of history.</i>

613
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:31,007
Maybe Shakespeare got it wrong.

614
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:34,743
Well, you know,
it was a different time.

615
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:37,480
He was dealing
with different issues.

616
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,714
Maybe he had it right.

617
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:41,021
Maybe it just was different
later.

618
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:48,624
<i>Nelson Rockefeller has taken
himself out of consideration</i>

619
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,158
<i>as a vice presidential candidate</i>

620
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,960
<i>on president Ford's ticket
next year.</i>

621
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:53,721
<i>Rockefeller has
little choice in the matter.</i>

622
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:56,531
<i>Rumsfeld's calculated plan
to pave his own way</i>

623
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,466
<i>as a running mate
for president Ford.</i>

624
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:00,220
<i>Donald Rumsfeld has
been mentioned for months</i>

625
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,781
<i>as a possible vice presidential
running mate with president Ford.</i>

626
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:04,439
<i>...in congress think
his new job</i>

627
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,808
<i>as defense secretary is a means</i>

628
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,442
<i>of putting Rumsfeld
in the running</i>

629
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:09,044
<i>for the vice presidency.</i>

630
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:11,080
<i>Donald Rumsfeld
takes over the Pentagon</i>

631
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,749
<i>but also keeps most
of his personal influence</i>

632
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,984
<i>with president Ford.</i>

633
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,185
<i>...the shake-up
took place.</i>

634
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:17,752
<i>The consensus is that Rumsfeld</i>

635
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:19,087
<i>again emerged the winner.</i>

636
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:20,555
<i>Rumsfeld's
conservative influence</i>

637
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:22,036
<i>at the White House
will be carried on</i>

638
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,892
<i>by 34-year-old
Richard Cheney,</i>

639
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:25,794
<i>who said in his office
this afternoon,</i>

640
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:29,101
<i>he'll be running things
just like don did.</i>

641
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:34,736
<i>In November 1975...</i>

642
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:41,544
<i>I became the youngest secretary
of defense in history.</i>

643
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,926
<i>It's important, I suppose,</i>

644
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:00,229
<i>to go back
and set the background</i>

645
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,702
<i>for this occasion.</i>

646
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:08,870
<i>Henry Kissinger had the job</i>

647
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:13,241
<i>of fostering Detentes,</i>

648
00:40:13,242 --> 00:40:16,614
<i>a lessening of tension
with the Soviet Union.</i>

649
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:20,783
The more talk there was
about Detentes

650
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,618
and the more
these negotiations went on

651
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,689
and the more people sat around
clinking champagne glasses

652
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,256
with great big smiles,

653
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:30,526
and the world saw all of that,

654
00:40:30,527 --> 00:40:32,060
the congress
and the American people

655
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:34,796
would not be in favor of
increasing defense investment.

656
00:40:34,797 --> 00:40:38,600
It was really fundamental
differences of approach.

657
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:42,971
<i>Weakness, historically,
tends to prove to be provocative</i>

658
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:45,707
and create instabilities
in wars and conflicts.

659
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,877
Strength on our part
will contribute

660
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,318
to peace and stability
in the world.

661
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,745
I'm not saying with certainty

662
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:51,913
that the Russians are coming.

663
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,649
I'm saying the trends are here.

664
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,450
I'm not saying
the Russians are 10 feet tall.

665
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:56,785
I'm saying they used to be 5'3".

666
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:58,153
They're now 5'9 1/2",

667
00:40:58,154 --> 00:41:00,157
and they're growing,
and we're not.

668
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:06,928
<i>To be brand-new
in the department of defense</i>

669
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:11,966
<i>with a presidential campaign
going on,</i>

670
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:15,303
my task was to meet with members
of the United States congress.

671
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:18,540
Small, intimate setting
where I could take

672
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:19,774
a classified briefing

673
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:22,278
and show them
the overhead photographs

674
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,846
that were highly classified,
that were top secret,

675
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:28,253
let them see for themselves
what the Soviet Union was doing.

676
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:34,290
<i>I would get 6 or 8 or 10 of them</i>

677
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,058
and bring them down
to the Roosevelt room,

678
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:37,892
which is right
across from the oval office

679
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:39,333
in the west wing
of the White House.

680
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:40,995
Not in the Pentagon;
In the White House.

681
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:44,198
In the White House, absolutely.

682
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,067
<i>If you have a meeting
in the White House</i>

683
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,268
<i>in the Roosevelt room,</i>

684
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:48,636
<i>and the president stops by</i>

685
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:49,872
<i>and says hello to 'em,</i>

686
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:54,109
<i>it is much more memorable
for them.</i>

687
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,946
<i>I had a major fraction of
all the United States senators</i>

688
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,913
<i>and all the members
of the congress</i>

689
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:00,281
<i>come in to those meetings,</i>

690
00:42:00,282 --> 00:42:04,118
<i>you know, night after
night after night.</i>

691
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,589
When you would show
these photographs to people

692
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,325
from satellites
or from a u-2,

693
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,030
people were amazed by them.

694
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,803
<i>In addition, we prepared a
unclassified series of charts.</i>

695
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:25,306
<i>One was on U.S./U.S.S.R.
Military manpower.</i>

696
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:30,946
<i>Another one had U.S. and Soviet
military investment...</i>

697
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:39,059
<i>Intercontinental
ballistic missile developments...</i>

698
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:47,328
Changes in
strategic force levels...

699
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:52,334
<i>Warheads, megatonnage,</i>

700
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:56,738
<i>estimated production rates.</i>

701
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:59,975
<i>No one statistic
was determinative.</i>

702
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:02,910
<i>What was important is,
what were the trend lines?</i>

703
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:32,411
<i>Did it come as a surprise
that Carter beat Ford in 1976?</i>

704
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:39,281
<i>He started out way behind.</i>

705
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:42,451
<i>If it had gone on
another week or two,</i>

706
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:45,888
<i>he might very well have won.</i>

707
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:08,176
<i>The republican
national convention</i>

708
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:10,913
<i>begins here tomorrow, and most
of the players are in place.</i>

709
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,154
<i>Everybody's playing the
vice presidential guessing game.</i>

710
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:14,883
<i>One big question remains.</i>

711
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,722
<i>Who will be Reagan's
vice presidential choice?</i>

712
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,599
<i>The Republicans are
floating some of the rumors</i>

713
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,189
<i>in an effort to keep--</i>

714
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,063
<i>the list includes former
ambassador George Bush,</i>

715
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:23,792
<i>who gave Reagan his
toughest primary battle,</i>

716
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,761
<i>or the defense secretary,
Donald Rumsfeld.</i>

717
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:27,620
<i>The questions about
Rumsfeld are whether his ties</i>

718
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,163
<i>to republican big business are too close</i>

719
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:31,165
<i>and whether he's too ambitious
to fit in</i>

720
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:32,487
<i>playing second fiddle to Reagan.</i>

721
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,741
<i>There is the picture
of Donald Rumsfeld</i>

722
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:43,345
<i>as Machiavelli,
and that you managed</i>

723
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:46,147
<i>George H.W. Bush
into the CIA</i>

724
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:50,151
as a way of destroying
his presidential ambitions.

725
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:52,053
It's utter nonsense.

726
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:53,254
He had to know the truth.

727
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,256
And why he would
promote that idea--

728
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:58,426
he must have believed it
for some reason.

729
00:44:58,427 --> 00:45:00,495
I suppose it's kind of
more fun for somebody

730
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,830
to be able to say
they were pushed,

731
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:04,938
rather than they tripped.

732
00:45:09,938 --> 00:45:13,875
<i>Reagan was up a floor above.</i>

733
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:17,312
<i>I was with my wife, Joyce.</i>

734
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:19,413
I had a man glued at my hip,

735
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:22,451
ready to tell me
if governor Reagan called

736
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:25,523
and wanted me
to be vice president.

737
00:45:27,523 --> 00:45:33,529
The press was filled
with this excitement

738
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,332
about the possibility
of president Reagan

739
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,567
selecting Gerald R. Ford.

740
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:43,337
I was stunned at the thought.

741
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:46,107
It's like sticking four hands
on the steering wheel.

742
00:45:46,108 --> 00:45:48,843
You're gonna end up
putting the truck in the ditch.

743
00:45:48,844 --> 00:45:50,078
My phone rang.

744
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,046
It was governor Reagan.

745
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:54,316
He said, "don,

746
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:57,386
I want you to know
that I've decided to have

747
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:02,223
George Bush be
my vice presidential nominee."

748
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:05,294
I said, "fantastic.

749
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:08,163
I am so relieved

750
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:11,066
that you decided
not to have Gerald Ford."

751
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:13,968
He said, "oh, no, don.

752
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:16,038
Jerry and I decided together

753
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,359
that it wouldn't be
a good idea."

754
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:23,145
<i>It seems to me
that if that decision</i>

755
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:25,314
<i>had gone
a slightly different way,</i>

756
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,381
you would have been
vice president

757
00:46:27,382 --> 00:46:32,287
and future president
of the United States.

758
00:46:32,288 --> 00:46:33,630
That's possible.

759
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,232
<i>I was living in Illinois</i>

760
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,901
<i>and was chief executive officer
of a pharmaceutical company,</i>

761
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,971
<i>G.D. Searle and co.</i>

762
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:53,375
<i>In a barracks in Beirut,</i>

763
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:57,613
<i>a truck loaded with explosives</i>

764
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:01,418
<i>came racing through the gate,
under the building.</i>

765
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:07,427
<i>Killed 241 Americans.</i>

766
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:14,395
<i>Shortly after,
the secretary of state,</i>

767
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:16,330
George Shultz, called and said

768
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:18,366
that they wanted me to serve

769
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,435
as special envoy
for president Reagan

770
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:22,671
to the Middle East.

771
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,640
<i>...with our new representative.</i>

772
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:28,042
<i>So, don, good luck,
and our hearts are with you.</i>

773
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,477
<i>Mr. President--</i>

774
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:33,982
<i>I began traveling in the region.</i>

775
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:38,486
<i>I would send cables back</i>

776
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:43,929
<i>trying to report back
on my observations.</i>

777
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:50,364
<i>I entitled one of them,
back in November of 1983,</i>

778
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:52,175
<i>"the swamp."</i>

779
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:01,509
<i>"I suspect we ought
to lighten our hand</i>

780
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,613
<i>in the Middle East.</i>

781
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:08,616
<i>We should move the framework
away from the current situation</i>

782
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:11,620
<i>where everyone is telling us
everything is our fault</i>

783
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,689
<i>and angry with us</i>

784
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,959
<i>to a basis where
they are seeking our help.</i>

785
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,062
<i>In the future,
we should never use U.S. troops</i>

786
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:25,200
<i>as a peacekeeping force.</i>

787
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:28,537
<i>We're too big a target.</i>

788
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:34,642
<i>Let the Fijians
or New Zealanders do that.</i>

789
00:48:34,643 --> 00:48:36,243
<i>And keep reminding ourselves</i>

790
00:48:36,244 --> 00:48:39,247
<i>that it is easier
to get into something</i>

791
00:48:39,248 --> 00:48:41,086
<i>than it is to get out of it.</i>

792
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:45,354
<i>I promise you,</i>

793
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,689
<i>you will never hear
out of my mouth the phrase,</i>

794
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,027
<i>'the U.S. seeks
a just and lasting peace</i>

795
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:53,766
<i>in the Middle East.'</i>

796
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,569
<i>there is little that is just,</i>

797
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,339
<i>and the only things I've seen
that are lasting</i>

798
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,182
<i>are conflict, blackmail,
and killing."</i>

799
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:34,703
<i>We arrived at night,
as I recall.</i>

800
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:40,107
<i>The building where
Saddam Hussein had his office</i>

801
00:49:40,108 --> 00:49:41,375
had sandbags all around it

802
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:42,810
because Baghdad is so close

803
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,613
to the Iranian border.

804
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,381
And they were at war with Iran,

805
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:48,817
and they were being shelled
from time to time.

806
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,553
We went into this building,
got in an elevator,

807
00:49:51,554 --> 00:49:53,622
went up,
got out of the elevator,

808
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,323
and the three or four people
I was with

809
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:57,526
were walking along.

810
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:01,296
All of a sudden,
an Iraqi cut me off

811
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,499
and took me down a corridor,
a dark corridor.

812
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,636
Oh, yeah, I don't know,
20 paces, 30 paces.

813
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,671
And then into a room.

814
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:11,305
And I was alone in the room,

815
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:13,508
and I looked up,
and here is this man

816
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:17,111
in fatigues
with a pistol on his hip.

817
00:50:17,112 --> 00:50:19,080
And it turned out
to be Tariq Aziz,

818
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:22,856
<i>the deputy prime minister
and foreign minister.</i>

819
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:32,259
It was hours that we were
in there talking alone.

820
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,462
It looked like
it had leather walls,

821
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:35,796
padded walls,

822
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:37,732
maybe Naugahyde or something.

823
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,453
We would have a meeting
with Saddam Hussein

824
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,337
the next morning,
and the time was set.

825
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:46,246
And we went in,
and there he was.

826
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:55,716
<i>A brutal dictator
in his military fatigues</i>

827
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:57,759
<i>with his pistol at his hip.</i>

828
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:05,493
It was just a preliminary step,

829
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:07,495
and it became almost iconic...

830
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:12,701
...my shaking hands
with this brutal dictator

831
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:16,813
who later became known as
"the butcher of Baghdad."

832
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:26,614
He postured constantly

833
00:51:26,615 --> 00:51:30,584
and was presenting himself
as the great leader,

834
00:51:30,585 --> 00:51:32,486
which dictators apparently do.

835
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:36,258
They foster that,
and have schoolkids praise them,

836
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,459
make sure that their image
is everywhere,

837
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,328
whether in a photograph
or a statue,

838
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:45,167
and cause people
to bow and kowtow.

839
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,835
And, you know, if you see
your picture everywhere

840
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:50,671
long enough,
and if you see enough statues,

841
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:53,741
pretty soon you might even
begin to believe that.

842
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:57,578
He almost became
a caricature of himself,

843
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:02,850
by my standards, as an outsider
not prone to worship idols.

844
00:52:02,851 --> 00:52:08,189
He was living
his image of himself,

845
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,597
which was pretend.

846
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:51,433
<i>There are those
who suggest today</i>

847
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,933
<i>that the United States
is in decline,</i>

848
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:54,803
<i>that, in fact, we should allow</i>

849
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,638
<i>someone else to contribute
to the stability in the world.</i>

850
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:59,406
I happen to disagree with that,

851
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:01,343
and I think that we need
to provide leadership,

852
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,512
and I think that leadership
can make an enormous difference

853
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,948
in what the world's gonna look like
in the 1990s and the year 2000.

854
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:09,317
If you read the newspapers
or watch television today,

855
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:11,453
and you look at the polls,

856
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,953
first they rank Gorbachev

857
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:14,989
as the reason that
these changes are occurring,

858
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,890
and second,
they gave Reagan some credit,

859
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,959
which is ridiculous.

860
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,796
The credit belongs
to Truman and Adenauer

861
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:24,633
and to steadfastness
over a period of 40 years.

862
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,003
The credit goes
to the investments

863
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,403
of billions of dollars

864
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:29,884
over a long, sustained
period of time

865
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:32,473
by people who were carped at
and criticized

866
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:35,310
and said, "oh, my goodness,
you're warmongers."

867
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,678
It went to the concept
of peace through strength.

868
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,383
And we need to understand
how we got to where we are,

869
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,852
because going forward, we're
gonna have to make a judgment

870
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:47,656
as to what role
our country ought to play,

871
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,457
and a passive role
would be terribly dangerous.

872
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,692
But who do we want to lead--

873
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:53,662
provide leadership in the world?

874
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,513
Somebody else?

875
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,546
We're here today
to swear in don Rumsfeld

876
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:13,515
as secretary of defense
and welcome him back

877
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,750
to the public service.

878
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:18,620
We were colleagues in government
for nearly six years,

879
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:21,023
and here, quite simply, is a
man who's been an executive,

880
00:54:22,023 --> 00:54:24,565
a statesman, and a human being
of the first order.

881
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:32,600
<i>I assume that Dick Cheney
brought you</i>

882
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:34,669
<i>into the bush administration.</i>

883
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,339
<i>I would assume that's the case.</i>

884
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,544
I don't think George W. Bush's
father recommended it.

885
00:54:47,048 --> 00:54:51,752
Obviously, George W. Bush
was his own man,

886
00:54:51,753 --> 00:54:54,458
made his own decisions.

887
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,059
<i>"Subject: Chain of command."</i>

888
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:02,464
<i>A memo to Condoleezza Rice.</i>

889
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,600
<i>"Because I've failed
to get you and the N.S.C. Staff</i>

890
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:08,470
<i>to stop giving tasks
to combatant commanders</i>

891
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,803
<i>and the joint staff,</i>

892
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:11,638
<i>I've drafted
the attached memorandum.</i>

893
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:13,107
<i>I'd hoped it would
not be necessary</i>

894
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,975
<i>for me to do it this way,</i>

895
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:16,643
<i>but since your last memo stated</i>

896
00:55:16,644 --> 00:55:19,381
<i>that we should work it out
from our end,</i>

897
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,915
<i>I'm forced to do so.</i>

898
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:22,584
<i>You are making a mistake.</i>

899
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,118
<i>You're not in
the chain of command.</i>

900
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,055
<i>Since you cannot seem
to accept that fact,</i>

901
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:29,056
<i>my only choices
are to go to the president</i>

902
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:30,991
<i>and ask him to tell you to stop</i>

903
00:55:30,992 --> 00:55:34,129
<i>or to tell anyone
in the department of defense</i>

904
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,696
<i>not to respond to you</i>

905
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:38,066
<i>or the national
security council staff.</i>

906
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:40,167
<i>I've decided
to take the latter course.</i>

907
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:42,470
<i>If it fails, I'll have to go
to the president.</i>

908
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:43,837
<i>One way or other, it will stop,</i>

909
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:46,473
<i>while I am secretary of defense.</i>

910
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:48,045
<i>Thanks."</i>

911
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:52,814
<i>Waging a high-profile war</i>

912
00:55:52,815 --> 00:55:54,915
<i>has thrust Donald Rumsfeld
into the public eye.</i>

913
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,850
<i>Two months into
the war against terror--</i>

914
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:59,421
<i>Rumsfeld, who has
become the voice of the war.</i>

915
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,921
<i>80% public approval.</i>

916
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,056
<i>Give and take
with the Pentagon press corps</i>

917
00:56:03,057 --> 00:56:05,197
<i>is now must-see television.</i>

918
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:10,564
Greetings.

919
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:11,799
Good morning.

920
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,201
Good afternoon.

921
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,169
You know, something's
neither good nor bad

922
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,071
but thinking makes it so,
I suppose.

923
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:19,441
Yes, you may ask that...

924
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,209
But will I answer that?
No.

925
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,912
I do not want the record to show

926
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,080
that I even bothered
to deny it, however.

927
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:29,049
So I've decided that
I'm not gonna go asking

928
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,618
for an unclassified
piece of paper.

929
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,520
I don't need it.
You need it.

930
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:35,457
So you get told things
every day that don't happen.

931
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,957
It doesn't seem
to bother people.

932
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,727
But I'm working my way
over to figuring out

933
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:41,162
how I won't answer that.

934
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:42,663
We'll make this
the last question.

935
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:44,232
Last question.

936
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,987
Mr. secretary, could I just
ask one thing about Gitmo?

937
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:47,008
Oh, no, no, I love that ending.

938
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:48,736
I'm--uh--

939
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:51,143
if you think I'm gonna mess
that one up, you're wrong.

940
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:04,185
<i>The U.S. and its Afghan
allies clearly have the momentum</i>

941
00:57:04,186 --> 00:57:06,120
<i>in the battle for Tora Bora.</i>

942
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:08,023
<i>Secretary Rumsfeld admitted
it is unclear</i>

943
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:10,591
<i>when this fight will end.</i>

944
00:57:10,592 --> 00:57:12,560
<i>The number of
prisoners is climbing.</i>

945
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,962
<i>Two weeks ago,
secretary Rumsfeld dismissed</i>

946
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:17,165
<i>the idea of detaining
large numbers</i>

947
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:18,665
<i>of captured fighters.</i>

948
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,567
<i>Well, this week,
he reversed himself,</i>

949
00:57:20,568 --> 00:57:24,643
<i>saying a large number would
likely be taken into custody.</i>

950
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:30,278
<i>"January 19, 2002."</i>

951
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:31,812
<i>The subject:</i>

952
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:35,616
<i>"Status of Taliban
and Al-Qaeda."</i>

953
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:37,685
<i>"The United States
has determined</i>

954
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:40,754
<i>that Al-Qaeda and Taliban
individuals</i>

955
00:57:40,755 --> 00:57:44,225
<i>under the control
of the department of defense,</i>

956
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:47,761
<i>are not entitled
to prisoner of war status</i>

957
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:52,734
<i>for purposes of the Geneva
conventions of 1949."</i>

958
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,968
Don't you think
that the decision on Geneva

959
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:57,772
caused so much trouble?

960
00:57:57,773 --> 00:58:00,808
Oh, my goodness, it would
have been so much easier

961
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:02,877
if you could treat people,
all of them,

962
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:06,113
the same as prisoners of war.

963
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:09,149
<i>Then you wouldn't have
to interrogate anybody.</i>

964
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:13,654
<i>You could just house them
someplace.</i>

965
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:15,924
Now, would that have been
a responsible thing

966
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,792
for the president
to do? No.

967
00:58:18,793 --> 00:58:22,230
The president needed to know
what was gonna happen next.

968
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:24,265
Every day,
the intelligence reports said,

969
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:25,899
"this is a risk.
This is a risk.

970
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,900
Watch out for this.
Something could happen there."

971
00:58:27,901 --> 00:58:31,978
It was the responsibility of the president
to try to prevent a future attack.

972
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:38,712
<i>Tell you what I'm gonna do.</i>

973
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:41,281
<i>I am gonna stay here</i>

974
00:58:41,282 --> 00:58:44,285
<i>and answer as many
detainee questions</i>

975
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:46,988
<i>as need to be answered.</i>

976
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:48,549
I don't know
that I'll know the answers

977
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,857
to all the questions,
but I--

978
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:51,292
if I don't, we'll find them,

979
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:54,062
because it seems to me
it's time to tap down

980
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,296
some of this hyperbole
that we're finding.

981
00:58:56,297 --> 00:58:58,066
Mr. secretary--
Mr. secretary--

982
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,667
- Mr. secretary--
- Mr. secretary.

983
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,308
Is John Walker being treated
the same way

984
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:03,337
- as the other detainees?
- Yes.

985
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:04,906
Shackled,
hooded in the transfer--

986
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:06,607
oh, my goodness.
Now, look.

987
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:08,642
Is he being treated
like the other detainees,

988
00:59:08,643 --> 00:59:11,044
shackled, hooded,
and what have you?

989
00:59:11,045 --> 00:59:15,049
Oh, well,
let me say this about that.

990
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,752
When people are moved,
they are restrained.

991
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:21,689
That is true in prisons
across the globe.

992
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,759
Will any single prisoner
be treated humanely?

993
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,160
You bet.

994
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:29,196
When they are being moved
from place to place,

995
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:30,964
will they be restrained in a way

996
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:33,401
so that they are less likely
to be able to

997
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,203
kill an American soldier?

998
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,337
You bet.

999
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:39,107
Is it inhumane
to do that? No.

1000
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,841
Would it be stupid
to do anything else?

1001
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,142
Yes.

1002
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:43,710
Mr. secretary--

1003
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:04,000
<i>what about all these
so-called "torture memos?"</i>

1004
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,003
Well, there were, what,
one or two or three.

1005
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:10,071
I don't know the number,
but there were not

1006
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,172
"all" of these
so-called memos.

1007
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:14,942
They were mischaracterized
as torture memos,

1008
01:00:14,943 --> 01:00:17,912
and they came, not out of
the bush administration per se,

1009
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:21,114
but they came out of
the U.S. department of justice,

1010
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:22,917
blessed by the Attorney General,

1011
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:26,386
the senior legal official
of the United States of America,

1012
01:00:26,387 --> 01:00:29,390
having been nominated
by a president and confirmed

1013
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:34,162
by the United States senate
overwhelmingly.

1014
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,196
Little different cast
I just put on it

1015
01:00:36,197 --> 01:00:38,471
than the one you did.

1016
01:00:44,005 --> 01:00:47,308
I'll chalk that one up.

1017
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:49,219
Was the reaction unfair?

1018
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:59,252
Well, I've never read them.

1019
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:00,488
- Really?
- No.

1020
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:02,364
I'm not a lawyer.
What would I know?

1021
01:01:09,364 --> 01:01:12,799
<i>I've never seen so much
misinformation communicated</i>

1022
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,309
<i>about a place than was the case
about Guantanamo bay, Cuba.</i>

1023
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:25,212
<i>This prison was
exceedingly well-run,</i>

1024
01:01:25,213 --> 01:01:27,047
yet the impression that's left

1025
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:29,884
is that it was a terrible place,

1026
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:33,120
and people were tortured,
and people were abused.

1027
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:34,888
Prisons aren't pretty places,

1028
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:37,792
but that prison
is probably as well-run

1029
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:39,398
as any prison
on the face of the earth.

1030
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:48,035
<i>If you go and ask somebody
in a big audience,</i>

1031
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:50,104
"how many people do you think
were waterboarded

1032
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:52,339
at Guantanamo?"

1033
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,942
And people stick their hands up,
and someone will say,

1034
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:56,310
"well, hundreds."

1035
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:58,379
The answer is,
"nobody."

1036
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,049
Zero were waterboarded
at Guantanamo.

1037
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,852
The military
never waterboarded anybody

1038
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:06,187
in an interrogation.

1039
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:09,457
The CIA waterboarded,
as I understand it,

1040
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,225
three people.

1041
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:13,528
But it wasn't at Guantanamo,
and it wasn't done

1042
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,964
by the United States
department of defense.

1043
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:18,899
Al Qahtani
was never waterboarded?

1044
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,868
No.

1045
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:22,270
Now, were there some things done

1046
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,238
that shouldn't have been done
at Guantanamo?

1047
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:25,161
You bet.

1048
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,562
When someone looked
like they were

1049
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:50,397
a very high-value detainee,

1050
01:02:50,398 --> 01:02:52,433
the department of defense
didn't deal with them.

1051
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:55,903
The central intelligence agency
did, and properly so.

1052
01:02:55,904 --> 01:02:59,207
<i>In the case of Qahtani,</i>

1053
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,075
<i>he was a high-value detainee,</i>

1054
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:05,212
<i>and for some reason,
he wasn't transferred.</i>

1055
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:07,281
Someone junior
in the chain of command

1056
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:10,884
decided that he was probably
the 20th hijacker.

1057
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:13,120
General hill wrote a memo.

1058
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:16,457
"There are three categories
of interrogation techniques

1059
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:19,326
that we would like you
to consider for approval."

1060
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:21,863
How unusual were
these techniques?

1061
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,330
Oh, they ran the gamut.

1062
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:25,566
One of the techniques
recommended was waterboarding,

1063
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:28,201
which I rejected.

1064
01:03:28,202 --> 01:03:31,538
<i>Others would be,
"yelling at the detainee,</i>

1065
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:33,040
<i>techniques of deception,</i>

1066
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:34,601
<i>where you'd use
multiple interrogator--</i>

1067
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,012
<i>interviewer may identify himself</i>

1068
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:38,312
<i>as a citizen of a foreign--</i>

1069
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:40,113
<i>with a reputation
for harsh treatment--</i>

1070
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:41,348
<i>category II techniques--</i>

1071
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:42,917
<i>stress positions, like standing,</i>

1072
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,218
<i>for a maximum of four hours.</i>

1073
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:45,540
<i>Falsified documents
or reports--</i>

1074
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:47,950
<i>the use of isolation
facility for up to 30 days.</i>

1075
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:49,656
<i>Deprivation of light
and auditory stimuli.</i>

1076
01:03:49,657 --> 01:03:51,192
<i>Hood placed over his head</i>

1077
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:52,893
<i>during transportation
and questioning.</i>

1078
01:03:52,894 --> 01:03:54,495
<i>20 hour interrogations.</i>

1079
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,736
<i>Removal of all comfort items,
including religious items.</i>

1080
01:03:56,737 --> 01:03:59,433
<i>Removal of clothing. Forced
grooming, shaving of facial hair.</i>

1081
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:02,069
<i>Detainee individual phobias,
such fear of dogs,</i>

1082
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,404
<i>to induce stress.</i>

1083
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:05,573
<i>Category III techniques.
Use of non--</i>

1084
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:10,044
<i>physical contact such as
grabbing and light pushing."</i>

1085
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:11,516
<i>I think that's all.</i>

1086
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:18,956
Good grief,
that's a pile of stuff.

1087
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:24,225
<i>Jim Haynes, the general counsel,</i>

1088
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:26,459
<i>sent it to me with a cover memo.</i>

1089
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,696
<i>"I recommend that you approve
most of the things</i>

1090
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:31,332
in category I, if not all,

1091
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,667
most of the things
in category II, if not all,

1092
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:36,504
and one or two or three
of the things in category III.

1093
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,605
But disapprove the others."

1094
01:04:38,606 --> 01:04:41,575
I remember one of the things
required that

1095
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:44,611
he'd stand for three or four,
five, six hours.

1096
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:47,448
When I approved it,
I wrote down that, you know,

1097
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:49,549
I stand for eight or ten
hours a day.

1098
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,390
I forget what I said,
but something like that.

1099
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:56,357
<i>Needless to say,
I did not intend</i>

1100
01:04:56,358 --> 01:04:59,331
<i>that my memo would then be sent
back down the chain of command.</i>

1101
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:06,634
<i>In the case of Qahtani,</i>

1102
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:08,602
<i>some of the things
that were done to him</i>

1103
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:10,175
<i>were not approved.</i>

1104
01:05:14,175 --> 01:05:16,710
<i>And the interrogation plan</i>

1105
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:19,212
<i>involving the duration
and the combination</i>

1106
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:23,456
<i>of the techniques
was not proper.</i>

1107
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,656
Up came a concern expressed
to the general counsel.

1108
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:32,017
"We hear some of these things
are being done to this fellow

1109
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:34,495
that aren't approved
or aren't proper

1110
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:35,997
in the interrogation plan."

1111
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,230
And he came in and told me,

1112
01:05:37,231 --> 01:05:40,134
and I immediately
rescinded that memo.

1113
01:05:40,135 --> 01:05:42,403
Some weeks later, we reissued

1114
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:45,171
the enhanced
interrogation techniques.

1115
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:47,774
There was criticism
from some of the military people

1116
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,745
in the chain
that by suspending them

1117
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,279
for a period of weeks,

1118
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,222
we were putting at risk
the American people.

1119
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:05,225
<i>How do you know
when you're going too far?</i>

1120
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:08,328
<i>You can't know with certainty.</i>

1121
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:11,503
<i>All the easy decisions
are made down below.</i>

1122
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:17,337
<i>When you say,
"how can you know?"</i>

1123
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:19,540
<i>The answer is,
"you can't."</i>

1124
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,611
<i>Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could see around corners,</i>

1125
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,645
<i>have our imaginations anticipate</i>

1126
01:06:25,646 --> 01:06:28,049
<i>every conceivable thing
that could happen and then,</i>

1127
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,317
<i>from that full array
and spectrum,</i>

1128
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:33,795
<i>pick out the ones
that will happen?</i>

1129
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:58,578
<i>Is there any
evidence to indicate</i>

1130
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:03,250
that Iraq has attempted to
or is willing to supply

1131
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,585
terrorists with weapons
of mass destruction?

1132
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,622
As we know,
there are known knowns.

1133
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:10,658
There are things
we know we know.

1134
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,759
We also know
there are known unknowns.

1135
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,727
That is to say,
we know there's some things

1136
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:16,497
we do not know.

1137
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:18,832
But there are also
unknown unknowns,

1138
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:21,267
the ones we don't know
we don't know.

1139
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:24,538
We just want to know,
are you aware of any evidence,

1140
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:26,707
because that would increase
our level of belief

1141
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:28,843
from faith to something
that would be...

1142
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,780
- Yeah...
- Based on evidence.

1143
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,149
<i>"Subject: To discuss with P.,"</i>

1144
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:40,721
<i>meaning the president
of the United States.</i>

1145
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:43,156
<i>"The absence of evidence</i>

1146
01:07:43,157 --> 01:07:45,132
<i>is not evidence of absence."</i>

1147
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:54,134
When you say,
"the absence of evidence

1148
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:57,571
is not evidence of absence,"
what you're saying

1149
01:07:57,572 --> 01:08:02,142
is that there is an absence
of evidence about something,

1150
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:07,714
but you ought not to say
that therefore that is proof

1151
01:08:07,715 --> 01:08:09,783
that something doesn't exist.

1152
01:08:09,784 --> 01:08:13,687
It's an easy thing to go
from the first part of that

1153
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:15,488
in the wrong direction and say,

1154
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:21,228
"well, the absence of evidence
means it isn't there."

1155
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:23,229
If an inspection team
goes in now

1156
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,764
and finds nothing because

1157
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,666
perhaps Iraq is very good
at hiding it

1158
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,935
or perhaps they have nothing--

1159
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:30,904
but you all are of the belief
that they have it--

1160
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:33,840
if they find nothing, does it
make your job more difficult

1161
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:37,178
in trying to assemble
an international coalition

1162
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,216
to disarm him by other means?

1163
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:44,218
Goodness gracious,
that is kind of like

1164
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,453
looking down the road
for every conceivable pothole

1165
01:08:47,454 --> 01:08:49,956
you can find
and then driving into it.

1166
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:52,526
I just don't--
I don't get up in the morning

1167
01:08:52,527 --> 01:08:54,661
and ask myself that.

1168
01:08:54,662 --> 01:08:56,496
The--

1169
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:58,965
we know they have
weapons of mass destruction.

1170
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:00,901
We know
they have active programs.

1171
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:05,206
There isn't any debate about it.

1172
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:09,542
It was thought to be
the best intelligence available.

1173
01:09:09,543 --> 01:09:10,778
How do you describe it

1174
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,647
when it turns out
to be not accurate?

1175
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:16,349
Do you describe that
as a failure of intelligence?

1176
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:20,720
I suppose some can,
not unfairly, suggest that.

1177
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,556
Saddam Hussein
may have been fearful

1178
01:09:23,557 --> 01:09:26,926
that he would be discovered
as having those weapons,

1179
01:09:26,927 --> 01:09:29,229
removed them or destroyed them,

1180
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:32,966
but not wanted to tell anybody
that he'd done so.

1181
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:36,237
<i>He may have destroyed them,</i>

1182
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,339
<i>unwilling to admit it,</i>

1183
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,809
<i>fearful of being seen as weak.</i>

1184
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:46,746
Wouldn't it be strange
if he had destroyed his W.M.D.

1185
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:48,952
And got invaded anyway?

1186
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:52,992
Of course, I'm not suggesting
that that's the case.

1187
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:56,256
I honestly do not know
what the case is.

1188
01:09:56,257 --> 01:09:59,893
All I know is that
the intelligence community

1189
01:09:59,894 --> 01:10:04,797
persuaded the president
and secretary Powell.

1190
01:10:04,798 --> 01:10:07,038
He spent days preparing himself
to make his presentation

1191
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:09,670
to the united nations.

1192
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:12,372
And he spent years
trying to explain

1193
01:10:12,373 --> 01:10:14,642
why he had done it.

1194
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,443
It's a short sentence.

1195
01:10:16,444 --> 01:10:18,951
The reason he presented it
was 'cause he believed it.

1196
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:25,653
<i>"October 15, 2001.</i>

<i>And where did this term
"shock and awe" come from?</i>

1225
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:48,602
<i>I don't know.</i>

1226
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:51,537
<i>Apparently, general Franks
read it.</i>

1227
01:11:51,538 --> 01:11:53,139
<i>He used it.</i>

1228
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:57,478
It became
part of a press discussion.

1229
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,647
But the idea of shock and awe?

1230
01:12:00,648 --> 01:12:04,019
I've told you all I know
about that phrase.

1231
01:13:09,984 --> 01:13:11,984
I picked up a newspaper today,

1232
01:13:11,985 --> 01:13:13,953
and I couldn't believe it.

1233
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:18,058
I read eight headlines
that talked about chaos,

1234
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:20,794
violence, unrest.

1235
01:13:20,795 --> 01:13:22,563
And it just was, "Henny Penny,

1236
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,764
the sky is falling."

1237
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:25,232
I've never seen
anything like it.

1238
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,701
And here is a country
that's being liberated.

1239
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:30,636
Here are people
who are going from being

1240
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:32,104
repressed
and held under the thumb

1241
01:13:32,105 --> 01:13:34,474
of a vicious dictator,
and they're free,

1242
01:13:34,475 --> 01:13:36,676
and all this newspaper could do,

1243
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,612
with 8 or 10 headlines--

1244
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:39,912
they showed a man bleeding,

1245
01:13:39,913 --> 01:13:42,782
a civilian who they claimed
we had shot.

1246
01:13:42,783 --> 01:13:46,487
One thing after another,
it's just unbelievable

1247
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,755
how people can take that away

1248
01:13:48,756 --> 01:13:51,657
from what is happening
in that country.

1249
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:54,161
Stuff happens.

1250
01:13:54,162 --> 01:13:56,082
But in terms of what's going on
in that country,

1251
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:00,501
it is a fundamental
misunderstanding

1252
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:04,036
to see those images
over and over and over again

1253
01:14:04,037 --> 01:14:06,038
of some boy walking out
with a vase,

1254
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:07,508
and saying, "oh, my goodness.

1255
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:08,942
You didn't have a plan."

1256
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:10,109
<i>That's nonsense.</i>

1257
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,678
<i>They know what they're doing,</i>

1258
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,112
<i>and they're doing
a terrific job.</i>

1259
01:14:13,113 --> 01:14:15,181
<i>And it's untidy,
and freedom's untidy,</i>

1260
01:14:15,182 --> 01:14:17,283
<i>and free people
are free to make mistakes</i>

1261
01:14:17,284 --> 01:14:20,086
<i>and commit crimes
and do bad things.</i>

1262
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:22,656
<i>They're also free
to live their lives</i>

1263
01:14:22,657 --> 01:14:23,991
<i>and do wonderful things.</i>

1264
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,692
<i>And that's
what's gonna happen here.</i>

1265
01:14:25,693 --> 01:14:27,701
Mr. secretary--

1266
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:36,536
<i>this was another violent
day in the streets of Baghdad.</i>

1267
01:14:36,537 --> 01:14:38,671
<i>One of Washington's
nightmares came true today.</i>

1268
01:14:38,672 --> 01:14:41,241
<i>The bush administration
is admitting it wasn't fully</i>

1269
01:14:41,242 --> 01:14:44,211
<i>prepared for the huge task
of governing post-war Iraq.</i>

1270
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:46,779
<i>Now troops patrol these
streets knowing that to many,</i>

1271
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,814
<i>they are not liberators,
but occupiers.</i>

1272
01:14:48,815 --> 01:14:50,255
<i>It's a situation
the Pentagon admits</i>

1273
01:14:50,256 --> 01:14:51,751
<i>it failed to anticipate.</i>

1274
01:14:51,752 --> 01:14:53,319
<i>The Pentagon is
scoffing at suggestions</i>

1275
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,625
<i>that an organized guerrilla
resistance is forming.</i>

1276
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:01,694
<i>"July 23, 2003."</i>

1277
01:15:01,695 --> 01:15:03,964
<i>To general John Abizaid.</i>

1278
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:07,233
<i>"Subject: Definitions.</i>

<i>'insurgency,'

01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:24,585
<i>they came from

01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,224
<i>Thanks."</i>

1283
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:32,326
It seemed to me
that there are ways

1284
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:35,696
you can talk about
what the enemy's doing

1285
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:38,665
that help the enemy
unintentionally

1286
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:42,234
and ways you can talk about
what the enemy's doing

1287
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:43,603
that harm the enemy,

1288
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:46,739
that make his task
less legitimate,

1289
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,907
more difficult.

1290
01:15:47,908 --> 01:15:49,710
What you're seeing is

1291
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,613
Rumsfeld floundering around,
trying to figure out,

1292
01:15:53,614 --> 01:15:55,081
what do all those words mean?

1293
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:57,117
What do other people think
they mean?

1294
01:15:57,118 --> 01:15:59,219
What are the best ones to use

1295
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,188
that will benefit
the United States of America?

1296
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:05,959
One of you suggested
I go to the dictionary.

1297
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,760
I didn't ask this question.

1298
01:16:07,761 --> 01:16:09,696
Yes, but he would have.

1299
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:12,032
I have since gone
to the dictionary,

1300
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:14,901
and I have looked up
several things,

1301
01:16:14,902 --> 01:16:16,903
one of which I can't
immediately recapture,

1302
01:16:16,904 --> 01:16:18,904
but one was "guerrilla war."

1303
01:16:18,905 --> 01:16:20,072
Another was "insurgency."

1304
01:16:20,073 --> 01:16:22,675
Another was
"unconventional war."

1305
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:23,876
Pardon me?

1306
01:16:23,877 --> 01:16:25,112
"Quagmire"?

1307
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,782
No, that's someone
else's business.

1308
01:16:29,783 --> 01:16:31,917
Quagmire's the--
I don't do quagmires.

1309
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:34,187
As I looked at the dictionary,

1310
01:16:34,188 --> 01:16:36,322
I'm not uncomfortable
with "unconventional,"

1311
01:16:36,323 --> 01:16:38,892
because it is not an army,
and it is not a Navy,

1312
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:40,727
and it is not an air force.

1313
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:42,696
But even there,
the dictionary--

1314
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:43,996
the Pentagon dictionary--

1315
01:16:43,997 --> 01:16:46,001
I haven't looked
in a regular dictionary.

1316
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:51,304
The Pentagon dictionary does not
even land that one perfectly

1317
01:16:51,305 --> 01:16:52,344
on what's taking place.

1318
01:16:56,344 --> 01:16:57,905
<i>The bush administration has been</i>

1319
01:16:58,011 --> 01:16:59,979
<i>on a stepped-up P.R. Campaign</i>

1320
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,848
<i>to stop the erosion
of support at home</i>

1321
01:17:01,849 --> 01:17:03,684
<i>for the dangerous mission
in Iraq.</i>

1322
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,685
<i>Today, an unprecedented
series of bombings</i>

1323
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:07,386
<i>left a trail
of death and devastation.</i>

1324
01:17:07,387 --> 01:17:09,790
<i>The concern
that Iraq's reconstruction is,</i>

1325
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,392
<i>in fact, falling well short
of expectations.</i>

1326
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:14,428
<i>Today in Fallujah,
Iraqi guerrillas</i>

1327
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,264
<i>used a roadside bomb to bring
an American patrol to--</i>

1328
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:20,399
<i>Briggs accused the Rumsfeld
team of being under-prepared</i>

1329
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,403
<i>for post-war conditions
on the ground and unwilling</i>

1330
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:25,938
<i>to share decision-making
with other government agencies.</i>

1331
01:17:25,939 --> 01:17:28,041
<i>Acknowledgement
that long-simmering tensions</i>

1332
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:30,911
<i>over Iraq and its aftermath,
particularly between</i>

1333
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,778
<i>the departments of state
and defense,</i>

1334
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:34,980
<i>have now reached full boil.</i>

1335
01:17:46,327 --> 01:17:49,429
<i>October of 2003.</i>

1336
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,364
<i>I became worried
that we were having trouble</i>

1337
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:55,469
<i>measuring progress,</i>

1338
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,775
<i>and I wrote a memo called
"global war on terror."</i>

1339
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:06,846
<i>"Are we winning or losing
the global war on terror?</i>

1340
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:10,050
<i>Is D.O.D. Changing
fast enough to deal</i>

1341
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:14,490
<i>with the new 21st-century
security environment?</i>

1342
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:20,993
<i>Are the changes we have
and are making too modest</i>

1343
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:23,199
<i>and incremental?</i>

1344
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:28,769
<i>My impression is that
we have not yet</i>

1345
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,304
<i>made truly bold moves,</i>

1346
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:35,407
<i>although we have made many
sensible, logical moves</i>

1347
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:37,144
<i>in the right direction."</i>

1348
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,014
<i>"But are they enough," I asked.</i>

1349
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:41,947
<i>"Today we lack metrics to know</i>

1350
01:18:41,948 --> 01:18:45,818
<i>if we are winning or losing
the global war on terror.</i>

1351
01:18:45,819 --> 01:18:50,090
<i>Are we killing or deterring
more terrorists every day</i>

1352
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:52,893
<i>than the madrassas
and the radical clerics</i>

1353
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:56,529
<i>are recruiting and deploying
against us?</i>

1354
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:59,566
<i>It's pretty clear
that the coalition can win</i>

1355
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:03,469
<i>in Afghanistan and Iraq</i>

1356
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:06,406
<i>in one way or another,</i>

1357
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:10,376
<i>but it will be
a long, hard slog."</i>

1358
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:28,394
<i>It was Christmastime.</i>

1359
01:19:28,395 --> 01:19:34,300
<i>I can recall going up
to the secure phone closet.</i>

1360
01:19:34,301 --> 01:19:36,269
<i>It's in the second floor
of our house,</i>

1361
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:39,272
<i>not too far from my bedroom.</i>

1362
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:42,209
<i>What was in there
was a noise system</i>

1363
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,448
<i>that sounded like an ocean wave.</i>

1364
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:50,951
They had scooped up some people,

1365
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,553
low-level people,

1366
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:57,890
who might have some reason
to know where he might be.

1367
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:00,260
He'd been moving
around the country every day,

1368
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:02,062
sleeping a different place,

1369
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:05,197
moving around in taxicabs.

1370
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,969
Also moving around
were some body doubles,

1371
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:12,339
people who looked
exactly like Saddam Hussein,

1372
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,175
indeed, had the same
distinguishing marks

1373
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:17,544
on their bodies.

1374
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:21,046
Some low-level individual
said that he believed

1375
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:23,282
he knew where
Saddam Hussein was.

1376
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:27,056
They inspected this farm
out in the middle of nowhere.

1377
01:20:30,056 --> 01:20:34,193
<i>There was a trapdoor.</i>

1378
01:20:34,194 --> 01:20:36,563
<i>They opened this up.</i>

1379
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:41,067
<i>Lo and behold, here was
this bedraggled, bearded man</i>

1380
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:42,206
<i>down in that hole.</i>

1381
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:50,542
<i>Saddam Hussein clearly
concluded it was all a bluff.</i>

1382
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:54,214
<i>The United States
was a paper tiger.</i>

1383
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:56,319
<i>They weren't gonna do anything.</i>

1384
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:01,287
The first Gulf war
left him feeling

1385
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:03,223
that no one
was gonna bother him.

1386
01:21:03,224 --> 01:21:05,925
He was the person who prevailed.

1387
01:21:05,926 --> 01:21:09,161
He obviously felt
that he was a survivor.

1388
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:12,532
And he was, for a while.

1389
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:16,969
Someone said, "do you want
to go see Saddam Hussein,"

1390
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,103
after he was captured.

1391
01:21:18,104 --> 01:21:19,939
And I said,
"no."

1392
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:23,547
I said, "I would like
to talk to Tariq Aziz."

1393
01:21:27,547 --> 01:21:31,617
<i>It's a complicated situation
for me.</i>

1394
01:21:31,618 --> 01:21:33,319

1395
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,287
simultaneously
deputy prime minister

1396
01:21:35,288 --> 01:21:37,456
and foreign minister
for Saddam Hussein,

1397
01:21:37,457 --> 01:21:39,326
and you meet with him,
you come away

1398
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:43,095
with that he is a perfectly
rational, logical individual.

1399
01:21:43,096 --> 01:21:45,197
I've spent hours and hours
with him.

1400
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:48,268
You wonder what goes on
in a mind like that.

1401
01:21:48,269 --> 01:21:51,136
I would love to talk
to Tariq Aziz and figure out

1402
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:52,706
what in the world
they were thinking.

1403
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:55,274
What else might
the United States have done

1404
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:56,643
to reach out to them

1405
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:59,511

to behave rationally.

anything that I'd experienced.

1433
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,170
Why do you think
the pictures did it?

1434
01:23:31,171 --> 01:23:35,075
What it showed was people
engaging in acts of abuse

1435
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:39,182
that were disgusting
and revolting.

1436
01:23:42,182 --> 01:23:46,086
<i>There were pictures
showing that prison guards</i>

1437
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:47,821
<i>in the midnight shift</i>

1438
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:50,756

01:23:50,757 --> 01:23:54,794
<i>that didn't create injuries

1440
01:23:54,795 --> 01:23:57,296
<i>but they were engaging

1441
01:23:57,297 --> 01:24:00,466
<i>and there was nudity involved.</i>

1442
01:24:00,467 --> 01:24:05,438
I knew that it would create
a advantage for the terrorists,

1443
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:08,140
for Al-Qaeda and for the people
in the insurgency,

1444
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:09,309
who were out recruiting.

1445
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,777
They could show
that the Americans

1446
01:24:10,778 --> 01:24:12,578
were treating people badly.

1447
01:24:12,579 --> 01:24:14,880
It worked against everything
we were trying to do.

1448
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:17,416
I walked in
and said to the president,

1449
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:19,685
"I'm the senior person,
and I believe in accountability.

1450
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:22,193
<i>Here's my resignation."</i>

1451
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:27,594
<i>It was in my handwriting.</i>

1452
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:28,894
<i>I didn't want to dictate it</i>

1453
01:24:28,895 --> 01:24:31,574
<i>or have it typed up by somebody.</i>

1454
01:24:41,574 --> 01:24:43,408
<i>I felt a very strong sense</i>

1455
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:49,162
<i>that something terrible
had happened on my watch.</i>

1456
01:25:02,162 --> 01:25:05,564
He said, "don, I recognize
how you feel about this,

1457
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:09,269
but that's not gonna
solve the problem."

1458
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,639
<i>I testified before the house,
testified before the senate,</i>

1459
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:18,711
<i>tried to figure out
how everything happened.</i>

1460
01:25:18,712 --> 01:25:20,380
When a ship runs aground,

1461
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,648
the captain of the ship's
generally relieved.

1462
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:24,450
You don't relieve
your presidents,

1463
01:25:24,451 --> 01:25:26,618
and I couldn't find anyone
that I thought

1464
01:25:26,619 --> 01:25:30,956
it would be fair and responsible
to pin the tail on.

1465
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:34,294
So I sat down and wrote
a second letter of resignation,

1466
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:36,595
and I still believe to this day

1467
01:25:36,596 --> 01:25:39,732
that I was correct
and it would have been better,

1468
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:42,335
better for the administration
and the department of defense

1469
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:43,803
and better for me,

1470
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:45,505
if the department
could have started fresh

1471
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:48,675
with someone else
in the leadership position.

1472
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,376
So you wish
it had been accepted?

1473
01:25:50,377 --> 01:25:52,733
Yes.

1474
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:16,536
<i>There's a claim
that the interrogation rules</i>

1475
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:18,737
<i>used in Guantanamo</i>

1476
01:26:18,738 --> 01:26:21,009
<i>migrated to Iraq,</i>

1477
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:27,980
where they led
to incredible abuse.

1478
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:29,881
The evidence is to the contrary.

1479
01:26:29,882 --> 01:26:31,451
There were 12 investigations

1480
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:34,420
that looked at these issues,

1481
01:26:34,421 --> 01:26:35,854
some by civilians,

1482
01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:37,956
distinguished people like
Dr. Harold brown

1483
01:26:37,957 --> 01:26:40,827
and Dr. James Schlesinger,
former secretaries of defense,

1484
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,694
others by military officials.

1485
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:48,268
To suggest that
the procedures from Guantanamo

1486
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:51,837
migrated over to Iraq

1487
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:56,908
is to suggest that
the procedures in Guantanamo

1488
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:58,711
would have encouraged the kind

1489
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:03,515
of unbelievably bad, illegal,
improper behavior

1490
01:27:03,516 --> 01:27:04,951
that took place at Abu Ghraib,

1491
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:06,919
and there's nothing
that would have permitted

1492
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,420
anything like that.

1493
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:10,622
Anyone who reads
the investigative reports

1494
01:27:10,623 --> 01:27:13,430
knows that's not the case.

1495
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:20,332
<i>This is from
the Schlesinger report.</i>

1496
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:23,836

<i>as to which techniques
were authorized.</i>

1500
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,419
Although specifically limited
by the secretary of defense

1501
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,322
to Guantanamo, and requiring
his personal approval,

1502
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:45,625
given in only two cases,

1503

the augmented techniques
for Guantanamo

migrated to Afghanistan and Iraq

where they were neither limited
nor safeguarded."

1506
01:27:54,868 --> 01:27:56,368
Mm-hmm.

1507
01:27:56,369 --> 01:27:59,971
Yeah, I think
that's a fair assessment.

1508
01:27:59,972 --> 01:28:01,680
Mm-hmm.

1509
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,052
Are you saying
stuff just happens?

1510
01:28:13,052 --> 01:28:17,055
Well, we know that

1511
01:28:17,056 --> 01:28:21,493
in every war
there are things that evolve

1512
01:28:21,494 --> 01:28:25,497
that hadn't been planned for
or fully anticipated

1513
01:28:25,498 --> 01:28:29,535
and that things occur
which shouldn't occur.

1514
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:05,404
<i>Wouldn't it have been
better not to go there at all?</i>

1515
01:29:05,405 --> 01:29:07,650
<i>Well, I guess time will tell.</i>

1516
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:21,920
<i>Barack Obama opposed
most of the structures</i>

1517
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:25,892
<i>that president George W. Bush
put in place:</i>

1518
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:30,429
<i>Guantanamo bay, the concept
of indefinite detention,</i>

1519
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:33,769
<i>the patriot act,
military commissions.</i>

1520
01:29:35,769 --> 01:29:39,538
<i>Here we are, years later,</i>

1521
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:41,711
<i>and they're all still there.</i>

1522
01:29:44,711 --> 01:29:48,648
<i>I think that kind of has to
validate, to some extent,</i>

1523
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:52,561
<i>the decisions that were made
by president George W. Bush.</i>

1524
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:05,163
<i>We went to Bethesda
and Walter Reed</i>

1525
01:30:05,164 --> 01:30:08,067
<i>a great many times.</i>

1526
01:30:08,068 --> 01:30:11,970
The strength that you felt
from the families

1527
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,572
and the people wounded

1528
01:30:13,573 --> 01:30:18,544
was just absolutely
an inspiration.

1529
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:20,212
It was an intensive care unit.

1530
01:30:20,213 --> 01:30:22,886
The doctor said,
"this guy's not gonna make it."

1531
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:29,221
We walked in, met the man,
talked to him,

1532
01:30:29,222 --> 01:30:31,029
talked to the family.

1533
01:30:37,029 --> 01:30:40,733
I don't know what the word is.

1534
01:30:40,734 --> 01:30:44,036
But the family--
the wife said,

1535
01:30:44,037 --> 01:30:46,813
"I know he'll make it."

1536
01:30:52,813 --> 01:30:56,215
I think it was probably
two, three, four weeks later

1537
01:30:56,216 --> 01:30:57,916
I went back, and sure as heck,

1538
01:30:57,917 --> 01:30:59,618
the doctor said he made it.

1539
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:01,693
Unbelievable.

1540
01:31:06,693 --> 01:31:08,260
So we're
a very fortunate country,

1541
01:31:08,261 --> 01:31:10,196
and the good lord willing,

1542
01:31:10,197 --> 01:31:14,533
we won't have
to be engaged in wars,

1543
01:31:14,534 --> 01:31:16,935
but I'm afraid,
human nature being what it is,

1544
01:31:16,936 --> 01:31:20,007
that we'll have to continue
to ask young men and women

1545
01:31:21,007 --> 01:31:23,709
to come and serve our country,

1546
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,178
<i>and their lives will be at risk.</i>

1547
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:52,203
<i>When you're in a position
like secretary of defense,</i>

1548
01:31:52,204 --> 01:31:55,675
<i>do you feel that you actually
are in control of history</i>

1549
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,682
<i>or that history
is controlling you?</i>

1550
01:32:02,682 --> 01:32:05,283
Oh, neither.

1551
01:32:05,284 --> 01:32:07,819
Obviously,
you don't control history,

1552
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:12,292
and you are failing
if history controls you.

1553
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:29,375
<i>Are you surprised
when you go back</i>

1554
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:31,376
<i>and read these memos?</i>

1555
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:33,112
<i>Oh, my goodness, yes.</i>

1556
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:37,883
<i>I can't believe
some of the things I wrote.</i>

1557
01:32:37,884 --> 01:32:40,694
<i>I don't know where
all those words came from.</i>

1558
01:32:47,694 --> 01:32:51,363
<i>"February 4, 2004.</i>

1559
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:56,736
<i>Subject: What you know.</i>

1560
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,170
<i>There are knowns knowns.</i>

1561
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:02,340
<i>There are known unknowns.</i>

1562
01:33:02,341 --> 01:33:06,245
<i>There are unknown unknowns.</i>

1563
01:33:06,246 --> 01:33:11,250
<i>But there are also
unknown knowns.</i>

1564
01:33:11,251 --> 01:33:15,420
<i>That is to say,
things that you think you know</i>

1565
01:33:15,421 --> 01:33:18,694
<i>that it turns out
you did not."</i>

1566
01:33:20,694 --> 01:33:22,394
If you take those words

1567
01:33:22,395 --> 01:33:26,869
and try to connect them
in each way that is possible...

1568
01:33:29,869 --> 01:33:32,337
<i>There was at least
one more combination</i>

1569
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:33,839
<i>that wasn't there:</i>

1570
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,144
<i>The unknown knowns.</i>

1571
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:41,746
Things that
you possibly may know

1572
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:44,050
that you don't know you know.

1573
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:46,419
But the memo doesn't say that.

1574
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:51,857
It says we know less,
not more, than we think we do.

1575
01:33:51,858 --> 01:33:53,291
Is that right?
I reversed it?

1576
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:55,198
Put it up again.
Let me see.

1577
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:02,300
"There are also unknown knowns.

1578
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:06,906
That is to say,
things that you think you know

1579
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:09,308
that it turns out you did not."

1580
01:34:09,309 --> 01:34:12,044
Yeah, I think that memo
is backwards.

1581
01:34:12,045 --> 01:34:18,320
I think that it's closer
to what I said here than that.

1582
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,060
<i>Unknown knowns.</i>

1583
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:31,730
<i>I think you're probably, Errol,
chasing the wrong rabbit here.</i>

1584
01:34:56,922 --> 01:34:59,358
<i>As ubiquitous
as those suicide bombers</i>

1585
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:03,194
<i>have become in Iraq, far more
people are now being killed</i>

1586
01:35:03,195 --> 01:35:05,363
<i>by executions
than by those bombings.</i>

1587
01:35:05,364 --> 01:35:07,366
<i>Another 40 bodies today dumped</i>

1588
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:09,167
<i>on the streets of Baghdad,
tortured.</i>

1589
01:35:09,168 --> 01:35:11,370
<i>But with
an especially deadly October</i>

1590
01:35:11,371 --> 01:35:13,104
<i>and Iraq tipping toward chaos--</i>

1591
01:35:13,105 --> 01:35:16,341
<i>the U.S. is on
the brink of failure in Iraq.</i>

1592
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:19,778
<i>A parade of generals called
Rumsfeld’s war strategy flawed.</i>

1593
01:35:19,779 --> 01:35:22,413
<i>The democrats are in;
Donald Rumsfeld is out.</i>

1594
01:35:22,414 --> 01:35:25,151
<i>Firing secretary of
defense Donald Rumsfeld</i>

1595
01:35:25,152 --> 01:35:28,323
<i>and replacing him with a veteran
of his father's administration.</i>

1596
01:35:31,323 --> 01:35:34,225
<i>Mr. President,
thank you for your kind words.</i>

1597
01:35:34,226 --> 01:35:38,863
<i>The great respect that I have
for your leadership</i>

1598
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:44,370
<i>in this little-understood,
unfamiliar war,</i>

1599
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:49,041
<i>the first war
of the 21st century.</i>

1600
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:50,576
<i>It is not well known.</i>

1601
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:52,310
<i>It was not well understood.</i>

1602
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:55,547
<i>It is complex for people
to comprehend.</i>

1603
01:35:55,548 --> 01:35:58,517
<i>And I know with certainty
that, over time,</i>

1604
01:35:58,518 --> 01:36:04,261
<i>the contributions you've made
will be recorded by history.</i>

1605
01:36:08,261 --> 01:36:10,496
Thank you.

1606
01:36:10,497 --> 01:36:11,501
Mr. secretary.

1607
01:36:14,501 --> 01:36:16,035
This way.

1608
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:30,349
<i>"December 15, 2006.</i>

1609
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:32,084
<i>To: Pentagon personnel.</i>

1610
01:36:32,085 --> 01:36:34,385
<i>From: Donald Rumsfeld.</i>

1611
01:36:34,386 --> 01:36:37,956
<i>Subject: 'Snowflakes--</i>

1612
01:36:37,957 --> 01:36:41,864
<i>the blizzard is over.'</i>

1613
01:36:44,864 --> 01:36:46,197
<i>over the past six years,</i>

1614
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:51,103
<i>thousands of these memos
have fallen,</i>

1615
01:36:51,104 --> 01:36:52,604
<i>sometimes in blizzards,</i>

1616
01:36:52,605 --> 01:36:56,110
<i>and sometimes in cold
and lonely isolation.</i>

1617
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,612
<i>Yet, as surprising
as this may seem</i>

1618
01:37:00,613 --> 01:37:05,517
<i>to those who may have been
buried in the deluge,</i>

1619
01:37:05,518 --> 01:37:07,119
<i>there are many people
in the department</i>

1620
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:11,189
<i>who have never received
a snowflake.</i>

1621
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:15,493
<i>This snowflake
is especially for them.</i>

1622
01:37:15,494 --> 01:37:19,197
<i>Its message is, perhaps
typically, to the point.</i>

1623
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:22,568
<i>Thank you.</i>

1624
01:37:22,569 --> 01:37:25,237
<i>The blizzard is over."</i>

1625
01:37:45,692 --> 01:37:47,695
<i>One last question.</i>

1626
01:37:49,695 --> 01:37:52,096
Why are you doing this?

1627
01:37:52,097 --> 01:37:55,634
Why are you talking to me?

1628
01:37:55,635 --> 01:37:58,239
That is a vicious question.

1629
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:02,000
I'll be darned if I know.
