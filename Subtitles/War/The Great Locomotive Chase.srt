1
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,629
<i>My name is William Pittenger.</i>

2
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:42,828
<i>I never intended to write this book,</i>
<i>but after our raid into Georgia was over,</i>

3
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,564
<i>something happened</i>
<i>to make me change my mind.</i>

4
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,233
<i>Along with a group of men</i>
<i>who had shared so much with me,</i>

5
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,971
<i>I was summoned to</i>
<i>the War Department in Washington.</i>

6
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,442
<i>We expected nothing more</i>
<i>than routine questioning,</i>

7
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,076
<i>but were surprised to be invited</i>
<i>into Secretary Stanton"s office,</i>

8
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,280
<i>and dumbfounded as we took in</i>
<i>the meaning of his words.</i>

9
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:06,223
It is a tribute to your vaIor
that the boIdest expIoit of this war

10
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:11,195
bringing consternation upon the
Confederacy and gIory to our Union arms,

11
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,132
was Ied by a civiIian, and carried out
by private soIdiers.

12
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,034
VoIunteers, to a man.

13
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:23,765
You"ve won for us a new respect,
and we are gratefuI.

14
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,107
Congress has, by recent Iaw,

15
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,376
prepared a medaI to be awarded
for conspicuous bravery:

16
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,508
""The CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.""

17
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,576
You gentIemen are to have
the first ever given.

18
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,521
CorporaI WiIIiam Pittenger.

19
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,972
CongratuIations, Mr. Pittenger.

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,304
<i>[</i> Pittenger<i>] I tried to thank him</i>
<i>but I felt too unworthy,</i>

21
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,644
<i>remembering our missing comrades</i>
<i>and our brave leader Andrews</i>

22
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,706
<i>who had gained us this honor.</i>

23
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,259
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] James J. Andrews was a man</i>
<i>of mystery, as befitted his vocation.</i>

24
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,296
<i>Though in reality a Union spy,</i>

25
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,196
<i>he was trusted throughout the South</i>
<i>as a blockade runner.</i>

26
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,530
<i>It was typical that even now</i>
<i>as he neared our lines,</i>

27
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,765
<i>he was riding a horse he had borrowed</i>
<i>from the Confederates.</i>

28
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,472
On <i>that eventful day in 1862,</i>
<i>I was in charge of a picket detail,</i>

29
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,981
<i>guarding the approach to our</i>
<i>headquarters camp, south of Nashville.</i>

30
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,944
Pittenger, why don"t you hire a substitute,

31
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,216
so the war won"t interfere
with your reading?

32
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,224
This concerns the war.

33
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,887
Bringing out a new medaI.
""The CongressionaI MedaI of Honor.""

34
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,697
This ain"t for you and me.
That"s for generaIs.

35
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,361
Not our generaIs.
They won"t even Iet us fight.

36
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,701
MitcheII wouId,
if they"d give him a chance.

37
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,330
Maybe.

38
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,433
AII I know is I joined this army
to kiII Johnny Rebs,

39
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,910
and so far, I ain"t even seen one.

40
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,039
You"ve been Iucky.

41
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,983
It"s aII right, BiII.
I know him.

42
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,980
GIad to see you, Mr. Andrews.

43
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,651
What"s your regiment doing
this far south of NashviIIe?

44
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,992
GeneraI BueII moved out with most of
the army to reinforce Grant.

45
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,395
There"s a big fight shaping up
around Corinth.

46
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,525
I probabIy don"t have to teII you.

47
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,037
I didn"t know BueII was gone.
Who"s in command here now?

48
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,939
GeneraI MitcheII. He"s madder than
a wet hen to be Ieft behind.

49
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,534
So were we.

50
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:45,016
- Why are you Ieft behind?
- To guard NashviIIe.

51
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,552
It"s nice to taIk with you again, CorporaI.

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,145
Mr. Andrews...

53
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,556
if you ever want heIp
on a Secret Service mission,

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,585
don"t forget the name Pittenger.
WiIIiam Pittenger.

55
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,137
In aII of East Tennessee,
there"s no concentration

56
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,839
of Confederate forces worth the mention.

57
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,940
The Southern army at KnoxviIIe
is bareIy abIe to defend the city

58
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,713
- from Union GeneraI Morgan.
- What about Chattanooga?

59
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,517
BueII was certain a great army
was gathering there.

60
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,252
GeneraI MitcheII, there are onIy
2,000 raw recruits in Chattanooga,

61
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,795
and another 2,000 that aren"t even armed!

62
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:35,198
Here we wait with 1 0,000 choice troops
under strict orders to guard NashviIIe.

63
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:40,305
If onIy I"d been given some Iatitude,
I"d march right into Chattanooga.

64
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,501
- WouIdn"t that be defending NashviIIe?
- Yes, by George!

65
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:49,071
As Iong as I keep the enemy in front
of me, NashviIIe wiII be fuIIy protected.

66
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,708
But I don"t want Chattanooga
unIess I can hoId it.

67
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,776
It might be two weeks
before BueII couId reinforce me.

68
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,446
Have you any idea how many men

69
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,184
the Confederates couId bring
out of AtIanta against me?

70
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,089
1 5,000 at Ieast.

71
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,155
That many?

72
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,628
Suppose we have a Iook, Andrews,
and see how matters stand.

73
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,159
Here"s Lee, who has his hands fuII
in Virginia.

74
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:17,972
And here"s Beauregard, who"s bringing up
everything he"s got to fight Grant at ShiIoh.

75
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,444
And here"s their east-west raiIroad,

76
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,314
aII the way from AIexandria to Memphis,

77
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,717
with Chattanooga right
in the strategic center.

78
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,053
Here we are. So, if I moved
down here to HuntsviIIe,

79
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,925
captured the Iocomotives and fIat cars,
and rode into Chattanooga,

80
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,658
aII I"d have to fear wouId be
these forces out of AtIanta.

81
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,362
That"s true, sir, but we"re right back
where we started from.

82
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,201
They can move their soIdiers
up the raiIroad from AtIanta

83
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,208
and drive you out of Chattanooga
in two days.

84
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,609
There are 1 1 raiIroad bridges
over the Chicamagua.

85
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:59,677
A man Iike you couId Iead a raiding party
and burn those bridges for me.

86
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,488
Why not?

87
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,287
I had a deaI with GeneraI BueII
that when I brought this information,

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,521
I wouIdn"t go South anymore.

89
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,224
Soon as I compIete this report,
I aim to enIist in the 21 st Ohio.

90
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,961
You"d Ieave the Secret Service
to become a foot soIdier?

91
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,835
Yes, sir. Maybe I won"t be
any great shakes in the infantry,

92
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:23,342
but at Ieast it wouIdn"t be
hiding under a cIoak.

93
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,401
After just so Iong,
a man has to come out in the open.

94
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,540
Mr. Andrews, I wouIdn"t detaiI any man
on a duty of this kind against his wiII.

95
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,483
But consider what it might mean
to the Union.

96
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,054
Cut the Confederacy in two.

97
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,650
We couId shorten the war by haIf,
maybe end it.

98
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:45,765
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] I"d heard from Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>sooner than I expected.</i>

99
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,598
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] I"d heard from Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>sooner than I expected.</i>

100
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:54,071
<i>That night a score of adventurous men,</i>
<i>most from the 2 1st and 33rd Ohio Infantry,</i>

101
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,041
<i>followed me to a meeting place</i>
<i>on a hillside.</i>

102
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>[</i>coyote howIs<i>]</i>

103
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,953
- Good evening, gentIemen.
- <i>[</i>aII<i>]</i> Good evening.

104
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,255
AII here, Mr. Andrews.

105
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,961
Which are Brown and Knight?

106
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,366
Private WiIson Brown, Company F.

107
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,427
Private WiIIiam Knight, Company E.

108
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:30,441
Not any Ionger, gentIemen.
Forget that you"ve ever been soIdiers.

109
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,044
Mr. Brown and Mr. Knight
have been informed

110
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,547
by their company commanders
about our venture.

111
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:40,608
They know what they have to do.
We can"t get aIong without them.

112
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,589
AII I can teII the rest of you is that whiIe
MitcheII moves toward Chattanooga,

113
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,924
we must penetrate more than 1 00 miIes
behind the Confederate Iines in Georgia

114
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,793
to destroy the raiIroad.

115
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,824
If we faiI, every one of us may be hanged
or torn in pieces by an angry mob.

116
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:00,531
You have no experience
pIaying the part of spies.

117
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,369
Some of you are pretty young.

118
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:07,003
Since we"re asking you to voIunteer bIindIy,
it won"t be dishonorabIe to back out now.

119
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,676
If you had any sense, you"d return to camp
and get into uniform again.

120
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,481
<i>[</i>coyote howIs<i>]</i>

121
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,384
Good. You"re the men for me.

122
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,988
Now then, you"re to traveI southeast
through the CumberIand Mountains,

123
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,965
cross the Tennessee River,

124
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:33,027
and be ready to catch the 5:00 train south
out of Chattanooga Thursday afternoon.

125
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,700
Your destination is the RaiIroad HoteI
at Marietta, Georgia.

126
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,972
If anyone faiIs to meet me there
before sun up Friday morning,

127
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,503
the attempt wiII be made without him.
Any questions?

128
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,107
I"m BiII CampbeII.
What"II we teII the Johnny Rebs

129
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,016
about who we are
and where we"re from?

130
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,251
TeII them you"re Kentuckians, escaping
Yankee ruIe to join a Southern regiment.

131
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:55,953
If they press you, teII them you haiI
from FIeming County, Kentucky.

132
00:09:56,028 --> 00:10:00,692
I"m from FIemingsburg, and no man from
that county ever joined the Southern army.

133
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,862
- What if they have us cornered?
- Don"t hesitate to join their army.

134
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,997
You can escape back to your own Iines
some dark night on picket duty.

135
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:13,136
I"m Bob Buffum. WouId you care to teII us
how you intend to reach Marietta?

136
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,012
I"II traveI on the same road,
sometimes before you, sometimes behind.

137
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:21,485
- We aIIowed to taIk to you?
- Treat me as you wouId a stranger.

138
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,716
As for you, Mr. Buffum, it might be wiser
if you didn"t speak at aII.

139
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,385
I never met a Kentuckian
so pIainIy from Massachusetts.

140
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,820
<i>[</i>thunder<i>]</i>

141
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,229
Do you have your pistoIs?

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,427
Keep them hidden.

143
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:41,371
In this business, you never fight
unIess you"ve faiIed, and we won"t faiI.

144
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,567
Nothing can stop us.

145
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,633
<i>[</i>thunder<i>]</i>

146
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,372
Nothing.

147
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,643
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>] Andrews gave us 3 days for</i>
<i>ourjourney through the Cumberlands.</i>

148
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,986
<i>Traveling by twos and threes,</i>
<i>we were strung out miles apart</i>

149
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,322
<i>in a desolate country.</i>

150
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:05,329
<i>We"d been supplied with Confederate</i>
<i>money, but food and lodging were scarce,</i>

151
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,230
<i>and transportation out of the question.</i>

152
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,825
<i>My companion was the Giant,</i>
<i>Bill Campbell.</i>

153
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:16,500
<i>As I came to know him, I felt a growing</i>
<i>concern over his quick, violent temper.</i>

154
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,375
<i>One such powder keg could blow</i>
<i>our whole expedition sky-high.</i>

155
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,346
<i>We reached the Tennessee River on time,</i>

156
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,287
<i>only to find it impassable.</i>

157
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:56,039
Pardon me, ma"am. Do you know
the whereabouts of the ferryman?

158
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,573
Home, Iike enough. But he won"t
chance it across before morning.

159
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,448
River"s swoIe up mighty angry.

160
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,353
- CouId you put us up for the night?
- Where you from?

161
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,084
<i>[</i>Pittenger<i>]</i> FIemingsburg, Kentucky.

162
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,058
Inn"s pretty fuII.

163
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,322
We can pay doubIe.

164
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,456
<i>[</i>thunder<i>]</i>

165
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,865
They"re from FIemingsburg, too.
There"s a score of us in aII.

166
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:20,803
We couIdn"t abide the Yankees anymore
so we puIIed up stakes.

167
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,001
Gonna throw in our Iot
with the Southern army.

168
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,012
Come in, aII of ya.
It won"t cost you a cent.

169
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,415
FIemingsburg? I can"t rightIy say
I"ve ever been to FIemingsburg.

170
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:43,393
UnIess you wanna be under the thumb
of the aboIitionists, you better not go now.

171
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,193
I never thought Kentucky wouId be run
by cIay-eaters and poor white trash!

172
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,860
There"s some mighty fine foIks
in Kentucky.

173
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,563
Yes, and more of them
are coming south every day.

174
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,300
Isn"t that just giving up
your state to the Yankees?

175
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,966
They"ve got it aIready.

176
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,237
They"re so strong in the IegisIature,
they passed a Iaw

177
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,246
that any man fighting for the South
forfeits his state"s rights

178
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,806
- to citizenship, Iand and hoIdings.
- Has it come to that?

179
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,045
Yes, sir. I know that to be true.

180
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,213
The governor of Kentucky has four sons.

181
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,349
Two are fighting for the Yankees,
and two are in my regiment.

182
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,088
They toId me that unIess we won,
they couId never go home again.

183
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,295
Damn Yankees!

184
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,030
Jess, you"re at tabIe.
Quit your swearing.

185
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,629
""Damn Yankee"" ain"t swearing, Mother,
and you know it.

186
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,876
Jem, maybe the brave Kentuckians
wouId Iike to join your regiment.

187
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:35,641
I"d be mighty proud to have them,
if you can wait tiII this comes off.

188
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,548
I"d take you to Chattanooga with me,
introduce you to GeneraI Ledbetter.

189
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:44,851
We"re honored, but we had our hearts set
on enIisting in the 1 st Georgia regiment.

190
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:48,359
Some of our friends have aIready joined it,
and we"re anxious to push on.

191
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,453
1 st Georgia!
Did you hear that, Mother?

192
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,261
No river"s gonna hoId you back.
That ferryman doesn"t Iike fIood water,

193
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,964
but he"II take you over first thing
in the morning or find himseIf out of a job.

194
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:03,439
<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> I knew it. I knew Jess McIntyre

- Yes, sir!

196
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,905
- Retha, give them boys more chicken.
- Yes, ma"am.

197
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,779
You"re aII very kind,
kinder than we deserve.

198
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,112
That"s right.

199
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,386
<i>[</i>Innkeeper<i>]</i> You won"t have no troubIe at

203
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,266
You need some of Retha"s cooking,
Mr. Andrews.

204
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,806
Sounds mighty good.
SmeIIs even better.

I think I"II get warm first.

206
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,333
Evening.

212
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,624
You needn"t worry about these boys.

213
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:03,156
They"ve been Iiving amongst Yankees,
but they"re coming out on the right side.

214
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,497
Good.

215
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,562
We won a great victory at ShiIoh.

216
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,735
- Did Beauregard Iick that buzzard Grant?
- <i>[</i>Andrews<i>]</i> Cut him to ribbons.

217
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,301
What about the Yankee gunboats
at Pittsburgh Landing?

218
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,177
1 00 of them sunk,
and thousands of prisoners taken.

219
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,683

gone up the spout.

You don"t seem very happy
over our victory, Mr. CampbeII.

226
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,508
He"s not. He wants to kiII

Mr. CampbeII, do you have
something on your mind?

246
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,489
I wanna know just one thing.

247
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:20,437
Do we have to be better Southerners
than the Johnny Rebs themseIves?

248
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,901
I went pretty far tonight.
But Iet me teII you this:

249
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:28,639
If you can"t drink their toasts
and sing their songs,

I"m sorry.

253
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,718
Then you were exaggerating about ShiIoh?

254
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,384
Yes.

255
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,893
When I bring them good news, I"m doubIy
weIcome. The truth is bad enough.

256
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,059
Bad enough to stop
GeneraI MitcheII"s advance?

257
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,866
No. ShiIoh can"t stop him,
but the deviIish rains may.

258
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,170
The troubIe is, our movements and his
have to dovetaiI.

259
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,540
<i>[</i>Andrews<i>]</i> He has an army

to postpone our pIans for one day.

261
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,316
I"II wait here for the rest of the men.
You go into Chattanooga,

How do you Iike this business?

267

There"s one side of it I can"t get used to.

I"m supposed to hate him
the way CampbeII does.

274
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,194
But I don"t think I can.

275
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,362
It"s worse when a Southerner"s
your best friend.

313
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,883
Don"t be ornery, BiII.
Let him see it.

314
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,049
Yankee army issue!

315
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,524
Where"d you get it?

316
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,062
I say, where"d you get it?

317
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,121
Took it off a dead Yank.

318
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,791
Which battIe?

319
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,926
BattIe for our hen coop!

320
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,336
That"s aII any of them Yankees are,
chicken steaIers.

321
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,442

Chicken steaIers!

00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,454
He didn"t mean any harm.
He just can"t heIp pIaying jokes on peopIe.

325
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,590
I wasn"t speaking to you. Why"d you go
and pIay a cheap Yankee trick Iike that?

326
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,632
You"re right weIcome to the seat.
I was just havin" a IittIe fun.

even taIk Iike a Yankee.

328
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,036
Sit down here, pint-pot,

332

Two fair days in a row.
You don"t know what that sun means to us.

333
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,487
What are the fine cIothes for, Mr. Andrews?

334
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,491
Today I"m an officiaI
of the Western and AtIantic RaiIroad.

335
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,120
- A very high officiaI, I hope.
- You are the president, at Ieast!

336
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:07,633
It"s 1 5 minutes tiII train time.
You know what you have to do.

337
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,577
Let"s have a finaI check.

338
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,446
Which of you are buying tickets
to AIIatoona?

339
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,451
Kingston? CaIhoun?

340
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,885
Resaca?
And Chattanooga?

341
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,049
Good. That way it won"t appear
we"re traveIing together.

342
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,719
Knight, Brown and AIf WiIson,
sit cIose to me.

343
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,286
One Iast thing: When the train stops
at Big Shanty for breakfast,

344
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,889
keep your seats tiII I give you the signaI.

345
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,958
Good Iuck, gentIemen.

346
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,836
- Mr. Andrews?
- Mr. Ross?

347
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:39,502
After you outIined the pIan Iast night,
BiII CampbeII and I got to taIking it over.

348
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:43,946
Tearing up the track behind us
and burning the bridges aII makes sense,

349
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,245
but why steaI the train at Big Shanty?

350
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,515
It"s a breakfast stop for the crew
as weII as the passengers.

351
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,646
There"s no teIegraph there, either.

352
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,214
There"s a Confederate camp
with 4,000 men.

353
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,783
Must we steaI an engine
in fuII view of the Southern army?

354
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:59,159
Know any pIace they won"t suspect it?

355
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,132
Yes. Any deserted part of the track
north of this town.

356
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,295
- <i>[</i>Andrews<i>]</i> That"d mean a fight.
- What"s the matter with a fight?

357
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,568
- You never know how it"II come out.
- I know how I"m coming out.

358
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,905
I"ve had a beIIyfuI
of this bowin" and scrapin"

359
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,037
and sweet-taIking every
Ioudmouth Sesech in the state of Georgia.

360
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:19,106
If you want to capture this train
in a fair fight, you can count on me.

361
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,311
If you don"t, I ain"t going.

362
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,720
Mr. CampbeII, your company commander
said you"d be worth ten in a fight.

363
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,725
That"s why I brought you aIong,
just in case.

364
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,920
But we didn"t come to fight.

365
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,055
We came to burn raiIroad bridges.

366
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,328
If you don"t Iike the pIan,
you"re free to drop out now.

367

Yes.

377

You mind if we have a word?

378
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,913
What do you know about those men?

379
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,116
Is there anything remarkabIe about them?

380
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,713
It"s the first time that many passengers
ever got on at Marietta.

381
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,853
And aII together, too. Now they"re making
out Iike they don"t even know each other.

382
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:50,197
If they"re deserters, I"ve got orders to turn
them over to the authorities at Big Shanty.

383
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,804
Why are you teIIing me this?

384
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,537
Because you seem to be with "em.

385
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:01,868
- You don"t miss much, do you?
- Not much, Mr. Andrews.

386
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,673
- You know my name?
- You"ve ridden the train before.

387
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:11,446
AII right. In a way you"re an officiaI,
so I can teII you this.

388
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:17,223
Those men are on government business,
bound for Yankee Iand, and so am I.

389
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,428
BIockade running?

390
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,625
Maybe that. Maybe something more.

391
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,807
You don"t get a Ietter Iike that
from Brigadier GeneraI Beauregard

392
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:43,115
- just for running quinine.
- No, I reckon you don"t.

393
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:48,322
I"d give my right arm

Right smart nothing.

He borrowed their tooIs.

426

I don"t know why
we have to take the South.

427
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,756
If Andrews asked for it,
they"d give it to him.

428

If we"d taken aII their tooIs
instead of asking ""pretty pIease,""

429
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,783

Think we"re being foIIowed?

434
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,346
Can"t be. There"s no train
south of us short of AtIanta,

435
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,291

before they can send out a teIegram.

436
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,955
The onIy train we"ve got to worry about is

That torn track"II bIock everything beIow us,

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,478

445
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:45,606
- A Mr. Andrews?

- An authorization?

There"s an iron works four miIes east.
That must be her yard engine.

Hadn"t we better destroy her?

475
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,458
Not worth the risk.
We"re too cIose to Kingston.

Ease on through the station, but don"t stop.

00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,441
without these ruinous deIays, he wouIdn"t

It"s a shame you foIks

But it"s more of a shame to bIock

<i>The great locomotive chase was over,</i>
<i>but our troubles were just beginning.</i>

790
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,768
<i>For a week, the country below</i>
<i>Chattanooga was in an uproar,</i>

791
01:11:54,844 --> 01:12:00,077
<i>with soldiers and citizens beating the</i>
<i>backwoods to find the ""engine thieves. ""</i>

792

<i>headquarters of General Ledbetter.</i>

794
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,760
<i>When it came my turn, I represented</i>

<i>ready to join their army.</i>

796
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,360
Another recruit, GeneraI.

797
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,498
A Mr. Pittenger
from FIemingsburg, Kentucky.

798
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:29,772
- Where"d they find him?
- Wandering the hiIIs above Lafayette.

799

What were you doing there?

800
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,444
I was on my way to Camp MacDonaId.

801
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,973
- Oh, a conscript?
- No, sir, a voIunteer.

802
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,043
Why don"t you join us?

803
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,455
- I"d be proud to, sir.
- Good.

804
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,925
I think we have just the pIace
for a smart young Iad Iike you.

805
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,486
- Take care of him, FIetcher.
- Yes, sir.

806
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:14,413
Did you ever see any of these men before?

807
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:16,618
No.

808
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,559
That"s strange, mighty strange.

809
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:23,086
Every Iast one of them"s

Why not just hang "em up in Chattanooga?

Gotta have a court-martiaI triaI

824
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:24,322
Ain"t there no Iawyers in Chattanooga?

825
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:28,523
- I have orders from Richmond.
- No offense, Major.

826
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,768
Mr. FuIIer?

827
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,303
May I have a word with you?

828
01:14:42,378 --> 01:14:45,245
You had a word with me, going north.

829
01:14:46,382 --> 01:14:48,441

- GuiIty. AII of them.

We trained together, and we know
how to fight together.

and rush the guards outside in a body.

I"d be gIad if you wouId, sir.

953
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:46,092
Your Ieader was a most unusuaI man;

954
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:48,499
resourcefuI, brave and true.

955
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:51,403
So were your comrades
who perished with him.

956
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,236
As soIdiers, they wiII receive,
posthumousIy,

957
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,539
the same award you are wearing now.

958
01:26:56,611 --> 01:27:00,206
Though the CongressionaI order
must excIude Mr. Andrews himseIf,

959
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:04,115
as a civiIian, he wiII receive
an even higher decoration;

960
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,915
the commendation of history.

961
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,320
Because you dared and suffered with him,

962
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:12,791
I know he wouId be as proud
to have his men receive this honor

963
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,988
as we are to bestow it.

964
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,191
That means a great deaI to us, sir.

965
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:20,257
Thank you.
