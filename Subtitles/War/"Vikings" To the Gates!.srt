(Kalf):<i> We'll mount attacks both
from the water and from the land.</i>

9

15

- (Woman): I don't know.

343
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:34,067
What happened?

344
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:38,565
He was proving that you don't
need a title to be a leader.

(Breathing heavily)

346
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:49,196
You should never have
let him climb the ladder.

Now he may die.

348
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:53,833
Both of you stop
treating him like a child.

349

What are you doing here?

355
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,850
I can't bear to face the others.

356
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,471
(Helga): Why?

357
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,338
Because all of this disaster is my fault.

358
00:35:57,204 --> 00:36:01,045
For their own reasons, the
gods have decided to punish me.

359
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,503
And I don't understand.

360
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,687
Everything I did,

361
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:08,433
everything I have done, I did for them.

362
00:36:08,463 --> 00:36:11,285
This is not all about you!

363
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:13,952
Don't be angry with me.

364
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:17,463
- Please don't be angry with me.
- Why not?

365
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,104
How am I supposed to
live, knowing what I know?

366
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:24,056
You don't think of anybody but yourself.

367
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:28,598
(Shivering) That's not
true! That's not true, Helga.

368
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:31,040
I think about all of us.

369
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,719
I think about every
human being in Midgard.

370
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,404
Hel... Helga, don't go.

371
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,368

00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,706
Alive.

378
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,354
You want to hate me,

379
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,945
but you can't.

380
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,994
Can't I?

381
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:50,261
(Kalf): All I know

382
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:57,622
is that I desire you with all my heart.

383
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:00,799
I want to be with you.

384
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:16,131
How could I believe you?

385
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,426
I could have let you die.

386
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:25,640
What if I accept what you have to say?

387
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,373
What if I agree to be with you

388
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:31,970
and go with you?

389
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:39,725
But I will never forgive
you for usurping my earldom.

390
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:44,031
And one day, I will kill you.

391
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:54,484
If you accept that condition,

392
00:38:56,826 --> 00:39:00,381
then let us be together

393
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:06,288
and enjoy each other.

394
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,033
(Ragnar urinating)

395
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,015
(Groaning)

396
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,823
You see?

397
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,761
You should never have called me that.

398
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,500
Called you what?

399
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,746
Ironside.

400
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:53,162
(Chuckling) As if the
gods are protecting me.

401
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,087
Go.

402
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:59,975
(Coughing)

403
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:04,873
You're alive, aren't you?

404
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,466
Today went badly.

405
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,041
Yes, it did.

406
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,681
You led today.

407
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,755
I only did what my
instincts told me to do.

408
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:31,760
Well, that is a start.

409
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,382
What are we going to do?

410
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,173
(Sighs)

411
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:45,103
Before I decide I must
speak with an old friend.

412
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:56,446
(Groaning)

413
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:00,846
(Exhales) Athelstan.

414
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:03,806
I hope you can hear me, Athelstan,

415
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,052
and I'm not just talking to myself.

416
00:41:07,323 --> 00:41:08,781
Oh...

417
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,927
(Grunts)

418
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:16,185
(Exhales deeply)

419
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:19,127
What?

420
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:23,533
Do you think I went too far with Floki?

421
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,124
Hmm.

422
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,190
(Scoffs)

423
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,337
Can you actually believe that he thought

424
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:34,207
I would let him lead
without my having an agenda?

425
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:35,763
(Sighs)

426
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,207
If I was him, I would
worry less about the gods

427
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:46,318
and more about the fury of a patient man.

428
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:51,246
And as well you know,
I can be very patient.

429
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:52,938
(Regurgitates)

430
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,557
(Coughing)

431
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:06,022
(Sighs)

432
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:10,498
I wish you were here.

433
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:17,454
Paris is everything
you told me it would be.

434
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:24,486
And I am bound and determined

435
00:42:24,516 --> 00:42:28,309
to conquer it.

436
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:35,286
