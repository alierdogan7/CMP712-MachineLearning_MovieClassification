1
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,073
It seems too graphic
and unemotional.

2
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,512
I would prefer
those grieving people.

3
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,030
- For this double page here?

4
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,959
Yes, for the big page.
- Okay.

5
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,233
There's already a great deal
of misery in it!

6
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,910
I like this sad
figure walking through

7
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,236
the streets full of destruction...

8
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,671
Fits perfect!

9
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,715
And Goma! One million refugees!
Thousands died

10
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
and couldn't be
buried in the volcanic

11
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,230
soil. There were piles of corpses!

12
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,148
Right! The piles of corpses...

13
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,114
It'd be great!
There are the piles!

14
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,232
Okay.

15
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,518
That looks fantastic!

16
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,349
You think we should
use this one? - I'd enlarge it.

17
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,792
This is also a terrific picture.

18
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,472
The corpses being dumped.
- Maybe we should put it here.

19
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,229
Have it enlarged.
- Okay, fine.

20
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,312
Can you tell that the corpses
being dumped aren't in Africa?

21
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,910
You don't have
to see the corpses...

22
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,156
You can substitute
them with this.

23
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,273
Here you feel like you're being
shown some scene in Africa.

24
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,269
It starts with Africa, and you
think it's an African horror trip.

25
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,597
But his idea is worldwide horror.

26
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,831
It zooms in again...
- Then there's the head...

27
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,556
Then there's that poor guy.
- Looks terrific. - Okay.

28
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,310
Exactly.
Then we'll have a look at it.

29
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,508
Comma... now it's shorter.

30
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,076
After the Berlin Wall fell,
wars changed.

31
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,351
It was no longer nation against
nation,

32
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,914
but people against people.

33
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,398
Instead of high-tech weapons...
rifles

34
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,956
and machetes.
- James Nachtwey,

35
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,073
the world's most
famous war photographer,

36
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,590
has portrayed
these new conflicts and

37
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,155
victims in a way
nobody else ever could.

38
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,392
My son has arrived!

39
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,390
Oh, my son! Oh, my son!

40
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,276
Oh, you!

41
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,198
"Please, don't," I said.

42
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,040
"My brother
is deaf and speechless."

43
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,517
But they threw him
down from the truck,

44
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,075
took his money and killed him.

45
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,798
They cut off my other
brother's arm with a bread knife.

46
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,358
They tore my uncle's
son from his arms,

47
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,312
but he wouldn't let go.

48
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,359
So they shot him in the head,
and the child fell on the ground.

49
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,599
They gave me 2 minutes time,

50
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,600
and they held an automatic
weapon at my neck.

51
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,869
They wanted money.

52
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,272
Goodbye.

53
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,589
There are war photographers

54
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,236
who are only
able to endure the horror

55
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,958
of what they've seen,
experienced and escaped...

56
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,038
like in Vietnam...

57
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,632
by going with the soldiers
to the same brothels

58
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,719
and bars
and drinking the same whisky.

59
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,232
Others have become cyncical.

60
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,148
Jim is a remarkably
uncynical person,

61
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,590
which is all the more remarkable,

62
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,516
because most people have seen
a lot less misery and suffering.

63
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,112
Lonely because...

64
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,195
his experience sets him apart
from his colleagues and others.

65
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,675
He has become
a different person

66
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,030
as a result of those 25 years.

67
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,319
While we talked
about that horror

68
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,478
in order to
comprehend what we saw,

69
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,070
the absolute inferno of people

70
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,794
who were dead,
dying and vomiting,

71
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,836
never-ending lines of people
waiting outside the first-aid tents,

72
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,555
Jim said almost nothing.

73
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,353
Jim said hello. He talked

74
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,551
about some
organizational details,

75
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,877
then he said, "I'm going to bed."

76
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,118
And while
we needed beer to recover

77
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,709
from what we'd seen that day,

78
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,152
Jim had
one or two glasses of water

79
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,433
before going to bed.
Then he got up early

80
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,915
the next day to head out alone.

81
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,272
Good morning, Mister.
- Good morning.

82
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,595
For me, the early 80s
were characterized

83
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,791
by my move to New York.

84
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,071
I was a photo editor for GEO.

85
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,431
I'd worked
for SPIEGEL before that,

86
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,948
and I had an opportunity

87
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,676
to take over
the photography department

88
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,633
at the New York office of STERN.

89
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,960
That was in 1982.

90
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,514
It was
the first time that Nachtwey

91
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,034
came to STERN's office
with a portfolio,

92
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,190
and that led to a friendship,

93
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,517
a love affair.

94
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,913
Both of us had an idea

95
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,319
what that New York situation
was supposed to lead to.

96
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,514
Nachtwey wanted
to make a name for himself.

97
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,756
He was very bright...

98
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,272
and determined.
His mind was focused

99
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,515
It was no longer
nation against nation,

100
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,391
but people against people.

101
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,958
Like flight routes.

102
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,278
No winding roads.

103
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,397
There was one distinct,
straight, narrow, stony path

104
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,515
he had decided to take.

105
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,471
Of course,
at times I wished it was

106
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,469
a warmer, closer,
more intense relationship.

107
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,516
But his work was
of great importance.

108
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,273
I'll do it.
I'll do it with my pictures.

109
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,395
I'll convince
people with my pictures.

110
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,995
Nachtwey came
back from Nicaragua.

111
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,830
He was relaxed and happy.

112
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,875
He brought me a necklace
made of shells.

113
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,994
He put it around my neck,
and I thought that was great.

114
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,679
I remember
the first time I met him.

115
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,309
His hair was parted,
his jeans were creased,

116
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,512
his shirt was immaculate.

117
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,554
And amidst all
that dust and chaos,

118
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,479
stood this man
I'd never seen before

119
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,276
taking his pictures. He was
in no hurry like the others.

120
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,709
He was somehow calm,

121
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,270
as suddenly
South African photographer

122
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,835
Ken Oosterbroek
was killed next to him.

123
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,310
Normally, two sorts of journalists
are hit:

124
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,351
The ones
on their first assignment,

125
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,031
and the ones
who have been at it too long

126
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,754
and think they're bulletproof.

127
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,319
Jim is in danger
of seeing himself as bulletproof,

128
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,912
in danger of pushing his luck
once too often.

129
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,595
As someone
who is quite reserved,

130
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,230
he needs that kick,
that adventure,

131
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,558
that flow of adrenalin
and the fear of dying,

132
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,752
in order to feel alive.

133
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,876
Jim is at his best
in the most extreme situation.

134
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,631
That's it. He keeps
on pushing those limits.

135
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,748
Tough...

136
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,474
Tough, tough, tough.

137
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,079
It's also very difficult
to talk to Nachtwey

138
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,559
about the insane situations
he has narrowly escaped.

139
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,833
It's excruciating the way some
photographers and journalists

140
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,352
never stop talking about what
they've experienced.

141
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,235
With Nachtwey, however,

142
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,351
you have to
drag everything out of him.

143
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,231
You really have to beg him,

144
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,353
and, even then, he tries to avoid
making the impression

145
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,872
that he's bragging, showing off.

146
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,593
When he returned
from an assignment,

147
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,474
and I wanted to grab him

148
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,639
and say,
"Tell me about it. How was it?"

149
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,668
No, first he had
to develop the pictures

150
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,234
and then look at them.

151
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,319
I don't know
where he kept everything,

152
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,999
or where he keeps it,

153
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,998
because the photo
material alone, the pictures,

154
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,514
are only a fraction
of what he has seen, felt, smelled

155
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,359
and heard.

156
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,311
He has his own library
of suffering in his head.

157
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,356
What were you thinking of?
Don't you want to talk about it?

158
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,558
Allah is great!

159
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,153
I feel that
James Nachtwey's pictures

160
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,432
possess the precision
of a war surgeon.

161
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,758
He hates to hear that.
He doesn't want to be compared

162
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,758
to a war surgeon,

163
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,792
because everyone
will then say,

164
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,832
"Aha, a
cold-hearted war surgeon."

165
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:35,309
He is unrelentless when dealing
with people and situations.

166
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,071
This very old-fashioned,

167
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,397
very unmodern characteristic

168
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,431
makes him, at the same time,
so untypical, so fascinating.

169
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:17,231
Do I make a living
from other people's suffering?

170
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,952
Has their suffering
and misery been...

171
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,472
my ladder to success?

172
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,478
Do I exploit people?

173
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,399
Am I the bloodsucker?
The vampire with the camera?

174
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,071
Thank you.
