Seeing as that you
already know all of this,

63
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:04,409

an example of an endangered
species, Mr. Kelter.

00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,988
Yeah. You were talking about
endangered species.

like pretty girls around here

72

will discuss
your endangered grade.

to help us out.

by a huge grizzly bear
up in Echo Mountain.

stay away from killer bears.

Just like you forgot
your homework
for the last three weeks.

Listen, you're precariously close
to not passing this class.

97
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,444
That means
you won't graduate.

98

What are you talking about?
I have to graduate.

99
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:50,253
Mr. Kelter, graduation is a privilege,
not a requirement.

100
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,316
That's why I've decided
to team the both of you up.

101
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,485
What? Why?

102
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,153
You're joking, right?

103
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,097
"He who helps others,
helps himself."

104
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,895
I don't need his help.

105
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,095
I can't help.

106
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,832
Gentlemen, let me
put it to you in this light.

107
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,172
If the two of you together

108
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:15,681
don't produce an in-depth presentation
by Monday after next,

109
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,046
one of you will be leaving
with an incomplete,

110
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,143
and the other
won't be leaving at all.

111
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,156
You didn't say
it was this bad.

112
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,821
Bear attack?
Can't expect it to be pretty.

113
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,294

right past Pine Creek.

there's a killer bear
on the loose up here.

before it controls us.

I've called the town meeting
for tonight.

120
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,351
Calling meetings, Kassel?
Are you tr ying to give me another ulcer?

121
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,013
That'll add fuel
to the fire!

122
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,580
We cant let this get out.
Do you understand that?

123
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,095
I understand that my job
is to protect the people of this town.

124
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,461
They have the right to know
there's a pissed off predator out here.

125
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,159
You don't know that, yet.

126
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,897
If I read one word about this
in any paper but our own local dish rag,

127
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,997
you're gonna have a tough time
finding work in Alaska.

128
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,507
What's that, John?

129
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,311
Nothing.

130
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,076
Maybe all-knowing Indian
around here, Eagleheart.

131
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,914
What do you think
we should do with this
vile creature?

132
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,284
It's a noble savage.

133
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,347
It's nice of you
to think so, Mayor,
but l'm just a ranger.

134
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,861
Listen, we've contacted
the Federal Game Warden.

135
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,897
He'll be here
with some tracking dogs
in a day or two.

136
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,365
Until then,
Eagleheart and I
will try to find it.

137
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,902
I don't give a rat's ass
who does it
or how you do it.

is last week's news.

That way.

140
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,349
Don't get too far ahead of us
or you'll be tomorrow's news.

141
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,019
You don't really think
a bear did this, do you?

142
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,183
You ever heard of a bear
killing three men?

143
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,894
Well, it's what Janzer claims.

144
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,658
Well, the poacher claims
it's a bear.

145
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,496
Let's call it that.
It's probably better--

146
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,559
Better than what?

147
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,003
Listen, don't answer that.

148
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,700
My only job
is to keep people happy.

149
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,405
Unfortunately, those people
are gonna want blood for this.
You know that.

150
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,883
I'm sure those yahoos
have wounded enough bears
to make that easy.

151
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,920
Listen, I'll head
above the falls
and see what I can find.

152
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,217
I give you two days.

153
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,190
But take care of you, John.

154
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,590
For God's sakes,
keep you radio on,
will you?

155
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,926

to come back here
and rescue you, you noble ass.

don't like each other.

We don't have
to like each other.

We just have
to work together.

169
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,081
Unless you get an incomplete,
I suggest you be
at the town meeting tonight.

170
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,620
Why is that, Jay?

171
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,680
Because you said yourself
bears are an endangered
species.

172
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,521
It's grizzlies.

173
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,561
Okay, whatever,
dick Britannica.

174
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,061
Just be there, right?

175
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,896
[tires screech]

176
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,366
Oh, yeah.
By the way,

177
00:13:56,435 --> 00:14:00,030
my cousin Jenny,
she likes you.

178
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,199
Don't ask me why.

179
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,174
She's gonna be there
tonight, too.

180
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,370
[tires screech]
[revs engine]

181
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,746
[soft music]

182
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,114
[low murmuring]

183
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,019
Jenny, Richard.
Richard, Jenny.

184
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,461
You're the one
that's coming with us
to the mountains this weekend.

185
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,364
What? No.

186
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,992
Jenny wants to come
along too,

187
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,469
but I told her I didn't think
that was a good idea.

188
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,766
That wouldn't be.

189
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,808
Why? I can handle it
myself, okay?

190
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,338
Can you hear me?

191
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,675
Good evening.

192
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,945
Uh...the Mayor
isn't here, yet.

193
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,543
So I think
I'll just get started.

194
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,755
I wanna thank all of you
for coming out tonight.

195
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:29,022
I know many of you are busy
getting ready
for the tourist season,

196
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,498
so... I'll just cut
to the chase.

197
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,501
Yesterday, as some of you
already know,

198
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,800
there was a bear attack
up on Echo Mountain.

199
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,397
Unfortunately,
three men were killed

200
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,705
and a fourth
was very, very lucky.

201
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,768
Taku He has returned.

202
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,679
Ed Janzer was found
by ranger Eagleheart

203
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,115
who happened to be
in the area of the attack.
[door closes]

204
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,653
Mr. Mayor.

205
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,315
And brought back
to town.

206
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,828
Ed was shaken up pretty badly,
but I'm happy to report
he's going to be alright.

207
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,730
I've contacted
the Federal Game Warden.

208
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,825
They have a couple
of Karelian bear dogs

209
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,234
who'll track the animal down
and kill it.

210
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,569
The problem is
they're over in Montana
right now

211
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,973
and won't be able
to get here for a few days.

212
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,034
I think you'll see
after looking it over

213
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,376
we really don't have much
to worry about.

214
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,542
Not much to worry about?
Sheriff, what about the tourists?

215
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:29,918
I'm sure the Mayor
will wanna comment on that but, uh,

216
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,981
my concern is for your safety
and the safety of our visitors.

217
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,822
What are we supposed to do
in the mean time, stay inside?

218
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,419
(Kassel)
No.

219
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,260
For what it's worth,
those men were up there illegally

220
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,664
and probably got between
the saw and her cubs.

221
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,828
If they go up there
and shoot that bear,

222
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,895
then the press
is gonna come up here.

223
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,204
We sure as hell don't need
any one dredging up ridiculous
monster stories again.

224
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,610
Exactly. That's why
there isn't going to be
any press coverage.

225
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,148
Our town needs
those tourism dollars.

226
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,515
How the bear's handled
is our business.
The important thing for us

227
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,146
is you just keep doing
what we've done for years.

228
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,090
We can't let
misguided reporters and crazy rumors

229
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,854
ruin our good town.

230
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,328
(Jenny )
Why do they have
to kill the bear?

231
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,060
When a bear kills a human,
they usually destroy it.

232
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,931
Would you kill it?

233
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,238
Me? No.

234
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,965
You gonna take
that shot or what?

235
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,270
Here's 20.
Says you gonna scratch again.

236
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,612
I can't believe you boys
are in here playing pool
and bullshitting

237
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,414
when your buddies
are rotting up on that mountain,

238
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,944
'cause of some pied-face
park ranger.

239
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:44,121
The way we hear
was that that Indian saved your heart.

240
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:48,223
Besides, Sheriff said
if anyone was caught up there,
we were gonna get arrested.

241
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,169
Ray, when in your life
have you ever paid attention to law?

242
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,697
That Indian's gonna have
his ass handed to him.

243
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,902
I bet you money on that.

244
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,212
They way
he took care of you?

245
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,613
Son of a bitch!

246
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,980
Come on!

247
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,451
( Ed)
What are you doing to me?
We're you there?

248
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,181
I had that bear
in my sights.

249
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,554
(Ed)
I came too, boys.

250
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,256
The boys
were ripped to pieces.

251
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,230
( Ed)
I've never seen
that much blood.

252
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,829
Who's with me?

253
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,201
This thing has got "A" written
all over it.

254
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,138
That's A for ass.

255
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,871
Alright, genius, wha--
what do you wanna do, huh?

256
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,744
You wanna go hit the library?
Stick your nose in a book?

257
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,181
Copy some pictures, huh?

258
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,583
That sounds
real exciting, dude!

259
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,021
You're pitiful, man.
No wonder you're still a virgin.

260
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,389
I just wanna have
a good time, alright?

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,556
Look, I'm gonna give you
an equation for you to learn.
This is very important.

262
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,500
Couple of girls
plus couple of beers equals fun!

263
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,867
And what about
graduating, huh?

264
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,607
Did you say
a couple of girls?

265
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,074
[laughs]

266
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,401
Evening, Trish.

267
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,275
Bye, Eddie.

268
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,920
[keys jingle]

269
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,825
How are you doing, Kassel?

270
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,323
Evening, Ed.

271
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,797
Look, I already told you
everything I know.

272
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,562
Right when I seen that bear
l got knocked out.

273
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,127
Would you like to check?

274
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,299
That's not what
I'm concerned about, Ed.

275
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,867
I'm concerned that
you might be planning
on doing something stupid.

276
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,505
Something
you might regret.

277
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,539
Wouldn't be
the first time.

278
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,711
It'll be the last
if you go near
Echo Mountain again.

279
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,884
Poaching is a crime, Ed.

280
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,687
The only reason you're not
behind bars tonight

281
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,388
is because
your buddies are dead.

282
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,729
So, if you're even thinking
about going back there, think again.

283
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,066
Thanks for this talk, Sheriff.

284
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,399
Go home, Ed.

285
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,916
(woman )
Who is going again?

286
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,579
Me, Jenny,
Rich, and Shea.

287
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,054
It's bad enough
I'm letting you take your cousin.

288
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,354
Momma, come on!
Shea is Richard's girlfriend, okay?

289
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,590
When we'll you be back?
And who's Rich?

290
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,929
Sunday or Monday.
Rich Winslow, Doris Winslow's son.

291
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,630
Oh, oh, Doris,
from the diner.
Nice lady.

292
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,734
Since when are you friends
with her son?

293
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,743
Oh, my God, mom!
I told you.

294
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,109
I just need his brains
so I can pass biology,

295
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,273
so I can graduate,
remember?

296
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,044
Well, I suppose.

297
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:31,454
Just stay away
from where the bear is.
And no drinking!

298
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,755
Don't worry, mom.
I'll be too busy working
on my six pack to drink.

299
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,455
[country music]

300
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,759
(Leo )
Woo!
Now we're huntin' boys!

301
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,495
Yeah. When you shut your mouth
and open your eyes,
then you'll be hunting.

302
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,902
Okay.
So, what's the plan?

303
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,635
We're gonna drive
over these two next ridges
as far as we can get

304
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,472
and we're gonna
set up camp.

305
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,845
A beer.

306
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,079
Hey, are you really
gonna kill Eagleheart
if we come across him?

307
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,923
I'm gonna make me
a bear claw necklace.

308
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,086
[all laugh]

309
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,757
Look, we've been over this.

310
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,598
All I'm asking
is for permission to go
in there with a few guys

311
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,864
before your men
with the dogs get here.

312
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,803
Before somebody else
gets killed!

313
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,774
<i>[male voice]</i>
<i>We need that in writing.</i>

314
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,605
You need it in writing?

315
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,168
Approved by a judge.
Great.

316
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,845
<i>[male voice]</i>
<i>We need it in writing.</i>
<i>It has to be legal.</i>

317
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,887
Okay, fine.
I'll play your little game.

318
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,583
But know this.
One more person
from this town gets killed,

319
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,422
and I'll shove
that court injunction
so far up your ass

320
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,224
your gums will bleed.

321
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,162
You too, Sir.
Have a nice day.

322
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,134
That better be the Game Warden
saying he's gonna be here
first thing in the morning.

323
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,192
You missed some.

324
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,262
Huh?

325
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,773
Tasty cream filling?

326
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,505
Look, so far I've managed
to keep this tale from growing legs

327
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,104
and turning it into another
Echo Mountain legend.

328
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,376
It was a massacre actually.

329
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,578
The point is
you need to hold up your end

330
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,485
and get this bear
taken care of.

331
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,218
I don't want it
transplant it, either. I want it dead.

332
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,351
We can't have the thing
coming back here.

333
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:19,488
I know, I know.
We can't have the tourists getting eaten alive.

334
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,557
Is that all you care about?
The tourists?

335
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,795
The tourists
pay my salary.

336
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,395
And they pay
your salary.

337
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:32,136
Do your job,
Sheriff Kassel, while you still have one.

338
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,904
Yes, Sir!

339
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,949

342
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,292
What time is it?

343
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,202
It's 12:15.

344
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,999
I told you bear bull
was going to fail out on us.

345
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,568
He'll be here.

346
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,840
He won't!

347
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,404
Trust me.

348
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,711
Just so you know,
the grizzly bear stands over nine feet tall

349
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,883
and weighs
over 1,500 pounds.

350
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,427
Do you still wanna go?

351
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,826
[Manny laughing]
Put the dogs out!

352
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,205
[man laughing]

353
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:42,975

This is great!
Woo!

[bang]

355
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,814
Hey!

[engine stalls]

357
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,287
Forgot to get gas.

358
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,117
You stupid
son of a bitch!

359
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,928
So what we doin'?
Huntin' or campin'?

360
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,595
What are we gonna do
with my jeep?
Just leave it here?

361
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,504
You're the one
that ran out of gas.
What do you think?

362
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,564
Go and get elated.
[chuckles]

363
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,577
How are we gonna get
out of here now? Walk?

364
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,545
[bang]

365
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,641
Hey, guys!
Good camp spot
right by the creek.

366
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,050
And I got dinner, too.

367
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,350
We got steaks tonight, Tom!

368
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,754
Steaks?

369
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:26,813
(Manny )
Yeah!

370
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,951
He's got a wood rat!
Woo!
[laughs]

371
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,760
Woo-hoo!
Let me see that thing!
[laughs]

372
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,165
You're a hot nail.
C'mon!

373
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,203
You're crazy.
You're not a woodman.

374
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,365
[rock music]

375
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,440
Jay.
God!

376
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:53,348
You left a note.
You told me your parents said
it was gonna be okay.

377
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,785
Since when do you care
what my parents think
about you?

378
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:00,951
He's got a reputation
to uphold.

379
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,022
I least I got one, dicker.

380
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:20,401

[birds chirping]

383
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,660
Looks like someone
couldn't wait.

384
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,390
(Jay )
You think we should go ahead
and drive through?

385
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,456
No, there's no reason to.
The trail starts right here.

386
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,560
Are we gonna like
close to where
the attacks were?

387
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,073
I don't know.
They didn't say last night.
They said up by the falls.

388
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,405
Are we gonna go
up there?

389
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,240
I don't see why not!

390
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:03,711
I suppose you brought the guns
seeing that you're dying to go
where the action is.

391
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,691
No. My old man locked up
the gun cabinet before he left.
He hid the key.

392
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,158
(Jay )
What about you?

393
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,821
I don't have
an old man.

394
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,331
It's okay.
I brought bear repellent.

395
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,594
[Jay laughs]

396
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,761
Hey, do you wanna hold
my stupid sign?

397
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,236
Bears don't have anything.

398
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,773
Follow the stones,
you get to spray yourself his flavor

399
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:26,174
and for the bear
like to pass or something.

400
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,111
Go ahead and laugh.
At least l'm gonna feel safe.

401
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,448
(Jay)
Wait, you guys.
Hang on a sec.

402
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,016
This is for all of you
that are just tuning in right now.

403
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,291
This is the real deal
right here.
There's no fake stuff going on.

404
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,765
This is the tale of,
one, two, three, four horny kids

405
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,463
and their journey
up into the back country.

406
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,199
The journey
that will lead them face to face

407
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,207
with the killer
the grizzly bear.

408
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,005
The journey that
could be their last.

409
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,937
Woo!
[laughs]

410
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,392
[soft music]

411
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,881
It's beautiful up here.

412
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,752
(Jay )
Yes, it is.

413
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,019
You come up here
by yourself?

414
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,084
Sure, why not?

415
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,822
Don't you get scared?

416
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,890
No. I don't feel it's
anymore scared of you
than you are of it.

417
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,902
(Jenny )
So you think this bear
is scared of us?

418
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,961
Well, assuming
it was a bear.

419
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,202
(Jay )
Dick, what took those men
if it wasn't a bear, huh?

420
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,709
(Jenny )
It's Rich.

421
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,678
No, it's okay, Jenny.
My gram used to call me
little Dick.

422
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,738
Not even Jay
can do worse than that.

423
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,583
(Rich)
You really wanna know
what I think killed those men?

424
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,191
Didn't l ask you?

425
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,193
Okay.
Me!

426
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,092
[soft laughter]

427
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,858
Not funny.

[thriller music]

429
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,304
(Rich)
Are you okay?

430
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,140
You scared me.

431
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:45,205
I'm sorry.
I'm not so good for this.

432
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,648
What is it?

433
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,916
Nothing. I have the feeling
that something's watching me.

434
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,686
Oh, it's just me.
Come on.

435
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,991
[low grunt]

436
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,230
Alright, this is good.

437
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,898
I like it.

438
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,444
I see what you mean
with the sound.

439
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,572
Alright, you guys
just set up the tents
right here

440
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,083
and I'll go
round up some firewood.

441
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,190
Hey, Richard and you
have some stuff up here, huh?

442
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,625
I sure feel a lot safer
having him around.

443
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:34,290
Me too, you guys.
He's just so rugged
and handsome.

444
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,164
You know, you're just lucky
he agreed to come along.

445
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,726
Yeah, real lucky.

446
00:30:56,287 --> 00:31:00,348

452
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,608
Darling, you're beautiful.

453
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,513
No, give me the camera.

454
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:04,113
Hey!
David Crockett!
What took you so long?

455
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,389
There's a... grizzly.

456
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,395
Just now?
Where?

457
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,863
Right up over there.

458
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,163
Sure it wasn't a squirrel?
[laughs]

459
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,329
Yeah, yeah.
It was as big and heavy
just like your mother.

460
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,499
Do you think that
it was the same bear that--

461
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,772
No, no.
This bear wasn't interested
in killing anybody.

462
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,646
What did you do,
Nature boy?

463
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,172
I did what
we should always do.

464
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,378
Yeah? Did you cry
like a little girl
and wet yourself?

465
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,681
I stood there.

466
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,489
Jay, grow up.

467
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:41,814
What?

468
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,827
I'm gonna go change.

469
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,221
I would've run.

470
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,459
(Richard)
Oh, no.

471
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,058
You never outrun a bear.

472
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,604
It's the whole fight
or flight response.

473
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,640
If you flee, you're just--
you're like a rabbit
or a deer,

474
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:01,611
but if you stay
and if you hold your ground,
then you might have a chance.

475
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,546
Dude, you are so
full of crap.

476
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,413
I don't believe
a word of this.
Damn!

477
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,577
(Rich)
Really?
Okay.

478
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,644
What about
a thousand words?

479
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,330
(Jay shouting )
Deal!

480
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,390
Jay! Oh, my God,
you're such a pervert!
Get out of here.

481
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:27,268
I'm just recording
the scenery
for my project, baby.

[loud cricket chirping]

486
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,133
You cook like you drive.

487
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,362
Yeah, you just
keep it up, Ed.

488
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,667
You'll be gettin' hit
on the head again

489
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,004
and this time
it won't be from no bear.

490
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,512
How many times I gotta tell you
it was no bear
hitting on my head.

491
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,069
It was cheap dumb ass!

492
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,012
[men voices]

493
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,345
You see that?

494
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,748
[men laughing]

495
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,582
Be quiet for a minute.

496
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,645
What?

497
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,191
I don't know.
I thought I saw something.

498
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,786
It's the woods.
Stuff moves. Now cook.

499
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,594
Leo, cook, damn it!

500
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,132
Mac cheese and ketchup.

501
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,573
It's a dinner
of champions, baby.
Yeah! What!

502
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,679
(Jay)
M mm, mmm.

503
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,573
Hey, want some?

504
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,810
No, thanks.

505
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,215
(Jay)
Tastes good.

506
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:25,086
I'm sure
after next year,
when we all broke college

507
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,750
we'll be sick and tired
of Mac and cheese.

508
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,487
Why don't you tell us
a story Rich?

509
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,256
Something scary.

510
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,299
We need to decide
who's sleeping
in which tent.

511
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,563
I mean, if you're gonna go
tell scary stories,

512
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,662
specially ones
having to do with bears,

513
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,368
(Shea)
I'm not gonna sleep alone.
Jay?

514
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,037
What?
I didn't say anything.

515
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,740
No, okay.
You can sleep by me,

516
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,410
but don't try
anything funny, okay?

517
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,386
C'mon, Shea,
there's nothing funny
about sex!

518
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:03,489
Okay. Now that we have that
dealt with, let's hear
your story.

519
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,426
Wait.
Before you start,

520
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,025
I gotta get this
on tape.

521
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,361
(Rich)
Everything?

522
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:13,962
Uh-huh. Otherwise,
well, if I don't,

523
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:18,134
how else am I gonna show
Vancamp that his golden boy
drinks beer?

524
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,234
[coughs]

525
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,769
(Jay )
Besides, it's all part
of the project, specially

526
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,816
if the bear gets us!

527
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,180
Stop!

528
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,048
(Jay laughing )
Sorry.

529
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,611
Smile.

530
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,054
Alright, go ahead.

531
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,855
Before Pine Creek
was settled,

532
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,091
and long before
Echo Mountain
was a preserve,

533
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,224
this whole area
was sacred land
to the Indians who lived here.

534
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,202
They didn't hunt,
fish, nothing.

535
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,434
And to the Indians,
Echo Mountain was
no man's land.

536
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,738
Why did they call it
Echo Mountain anyways?

537
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,974
(Rich)
The Indians claim that
if you called out at night,

538
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,039
something would answer you.

539
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,607
Something
or someone?

540
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:05,384
Hey, Jenny, for the love
of all that's holy,
please, shut up!

541
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,083
Sorry.

542
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:14,559
Now, the spring of 1891,
a few miners passing through
discovered gold here.

543
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:18,534
They didn't want
word to get out, so they built
a small clandestine settlement

544
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,128
and began mining.

545
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,036
<i>(Jay)</i>
<i>The natives didn't like it,</i>

546
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,940
<i>but they're the peaceful kind</i>
<i>that kept to themselves.</i>

547
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,706
<i>Everything was going</i>
<i>really well.</i>

548
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,509
<i>Until--</i>
<i>[bang]</i>

549
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,680
Until?

550
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,185
Until something happened.

551
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,281
By the time the miners
finally sent word back
to their relatives,

552
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,795
they described this place
as a mountain paradise
with them as riches.

553
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,229
Then instructed them all
to sell everything
and come immediately.

554
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,028
And so they did.

555
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,160
When they arrived,

556
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,261
they found all the miners

557
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:58,434
and their families... dead.

558
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,342
Women, children,

559
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:04,575
<i>everything, everyone</i>
<i>was slaughtered.</i>

560
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,174
Without a second thought,

561
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,310
the settlers took their guns,

562
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,754
went to the nearest tribe
and slaughtered everyone.

563
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,655
<i>That was a real massacre.</i>

564
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,491
<i>Not some phony stories</i>
<i>about Indians killing</i>
<i>white women and children.</i>

565
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,895
<i>(Jay)</i>
<i>Yeah, I remember</i>
<i>hearing about this.</i>

566
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,297
[bang]

567
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,164
<i>(Jenny)</i>
<i>If the Indians didn't do it,</i>

568
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,703
<i>what did happen</i>
<i>to the settlers?</i>

569
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,763
The natives blamed
the other creature
made this place home.

570
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,206
(Jay)
Wait, wait.

571
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,540
This is not
one of those stupid
Bigfoot stories, is it?

572
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,874
It's Taku He.

573
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,074
What the hell
did you just say?

574
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,118
The native peoples
all over the world
have different names

575
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:45,383
like Taku He, Sasquatch,
Yeti, Bigfoot,

576
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,687
usually translated
to mean large man.

577
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,489
Do they consider them
dangerous?

578
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,462
I would imagine
they're like

579
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,897
<i>any other creature</i>
<i>in the wild.</i>

580
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,097
<i>If they're put in a situation</i>
<i>of danger, they react</i>
<i>with the fly or fight response,</i>

581
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,163
<i>specially if you got</i>
<i>between mother and child.</i>

582
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,937
<i>(Jenny)</i>
<i>Do you think any of them</i>
<i>still live here?</i>

583
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,841
<i>(Rich )</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>

584
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,313
<i>but the records of them</i>
<i>dating back all the way</i>
<i>to the first explorers.</i>

585
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,748
<i>All the way</i>
<i>until a couple</i>
<i>of years ago.</i>

586
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,183
<i>Wild, screeching beasts</i>

587
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,244
who hunt for game
and fish.

588
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,881
You can throw rods
and things.

589
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,154
Okay, that's enough.
I do want to sleep tonight.

590
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,128
No, I've seen
all those campy
Bigfoot movies

591
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,530
and they aren't scary.

592
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,000
(Jay)
Okay.
Well, then you know

593
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,129
any woman
on her menstrual cycle
should stay out of the woods.

594
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,572
What?
Why?

595
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,542
C'mon!
Use your imagination.

596
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,374
Who wants a lady
on the rag with you
when you're camping?

597
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,676
(Shea)
Jay, shut up.

598
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,549
(Rich)
Actually, it's because animals
can smell blood from miles.

599
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,416
Okay, that's enough.

600
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,015
I agree.
Could we please talk
about something else?

601
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,922
Anything else?

602
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,802
Well, beer's kicking in.

603
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,566
Jesus!

604
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,103
So, do you think it's,
you know,

605
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,974
killed anyone recently?

606
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,105
(Shea)
Jenny, stop.

607
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,876
Has it?

608
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,547
Well, there are records
of a few animals mutilated
found hanging in trees.

609
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,385
Trees?

610
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,549
(Rich)
Trees.

611
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,320
Is that why
you didn't wanna come?

612
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,157
Okay, enough.
Do not answer that question.

613
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,789
[thumping]

614
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:40,769
(Jay)
Oh, my God.
You guys. I saw it!

615
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,001
I saw it over there,
in the night.

616
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,868
[burst out laughing]

617
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,944
[laughing]
You should've seen her!

618
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,489
That wasn't funny!

619
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:06,053
Jay?
You are such a jerk!

620
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,165
Baby, c'mon!
It was just a joke.

621
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:14,363

<i>(man )</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Sheriff.</i>

623
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,438
<i>When I took his keys,</i>
<i>he got ignorant</i>

624
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,067
<i>and locked himself</i>
<i>in the head.</i>

625
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,476
How long
has he been in there?

626
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,538
Over an hour.

627
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,318
Ray!
Sheriff Kassel.

628
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:32,185
[drunken voice]
You got me
this time, Sheriff.

629
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,248
It's like
you got yourself there, Ray.

630
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,760
Planning on coming out
any time soon?

631
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:42,527
Are you planning
on giving me
my keys back, huh?

632
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,124
So I can drive home?

633
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:48,001
Why would I do
something like that, Ray?

634
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:53,203
'Cause I got
some information
and you don't know about.

635
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:04,118
You didn't hear this
from me, okay?

636
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,989
[burps]
But Ed and the boys

637
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,327
are going back up
in the mountains
to kill a bear.

638
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:18,562
And they said
they're gonna kill
Eagleheart, too.

639
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,536
What?

640
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,902
Eagleheart
saved his life.

641
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,566
Ed doesn't think so.

642
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,306
Ed thinks
that the Indian did it.

00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,732
(Tommy)
Damn near tore
his face off.

859
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,867
Somebody that wants
to send a message.

860
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,412
I don't like
the feel in here.

861
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,649
Let's keep moving.

862
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,685
(Shea)
Hey, Rich,
I was wondering,

863
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:23,358
you know, last night,
were you telling the truth
about all that stuff?

864
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,424
Yeah.

865
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,800
Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

866
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:34,972
So, you're saying
that Bigfoot is real

867
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,605
and that that's
what killed those men?

868
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:38,841
[crack]

869
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,680
Rich.

870
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,222
John.

871
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,350
What are you doing here?
You guys really
shouldn't be here.

872
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:51,519
(Jay)
Why not?

873
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,023
You all need
to leave here, now.

874
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,227
And we should listen
to you because--

875
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:04,399
Rich, can I talk with you
a moment in private?

876
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,409
What the hell's going on?

877
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,174
What's wrong?
Hey.

878
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,943
(Jenny)
Does anybody know
what they're talking about?

879
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,679
We'll never
gonna get out of here.

880
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,347
Oh, no, but look.
I think our boy scout

881
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:23,222
(Jay)
might be trying to get
his Indian badge.

882
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,319
He said we should get
the hell out of here.

883
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,863
Why?

884
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,126
Those gunshots
we heard last night.

885
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,601
There's a group of hunters
that are shooting
at everything.

886
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,932
They might come after us.

887
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,370
Come on!
Why would they do
something like that?

888
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,873
What else
did he say?

889
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,434
He said we should head
straight through the woods.

890
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,743
We gotta get the message
to the Sheriff, alright?
Come on!

891
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,777
Whoa!

892
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:50,149
Message?
What message?

893
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,380
<i>(Jay)</i>
<i>Hey, what message?</i>

894
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,428
Hey, you!

895
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:05,731
What the--
I don't believe this.

896
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,995
The bastard
trashed the camp.

897
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,906
You and your boys
need to leave here now.

898
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,376
I will be leaving, alright?

899
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,504
But after I finish
killing you.

900
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,879
Ed says it's your fault
my cousin was killed.

901
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,390
I had nothing to do with that.

902
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,722
I don't think
Ed is telling you everything.

903
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,953
You don't know what
you're messing with here.

904
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,932
What do you think
did this to your camp?

905
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:41,402
What do you think
killed Leo and the others?

906
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:45,202
You should know enough
about bears to know
they always cover their kill.

907
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:50,368
He's right, Ed.
I was wondering about that
the whole time.

908
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:55,008
You have three seconds
to explain what the hell
you're talking about.

909
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,485
Or I'll put a bullet
in that blasted badge of yours.

910
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,120
There's a creature out here

911
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:05,388
and you managed
to piss it off pretty good.

912
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,157
A creature.

913
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:11,997
We may be dumb
by we ain't stupid, Chief.

914
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:17,335
For the lack
of better word, yes, a creature.

915
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:21,366
And whatever Ed
was doing up here two days ago,

916
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,435
disturbed it.

917
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,413
What did you do, Ed?

918
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,948
Shoot at it?

919
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,315
I should've shot you.

920
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,412
Think what you want.

921
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,424
But right now,
you need to leave here

922
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,289
or it's gonna kill you all.

923
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,387
Why won't this thing
kill you, huh?

924
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:46,060
It will.
That's why I'm leaving.

925
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:51,903
You crazy Indian.
You ain't going any place.
Tie him up.

926
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:53,135
[shouting]
Tie him up!

927
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,749
Can I see the map?

928
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,486
Do not tell me
we're lost.

929
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,359
Just making sure
we don't get lost.

930
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,194
I'm getting hungry.

931
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:19,167
Alright, dick,
where do we go now?

932
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,897
Uhm,
[clears throat]

933
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,371
I think we go
that way.

934
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,907
Hey, good.
Let's go.

935
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:30,571
I'm not staying
in this forest another night.

936
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,308
I'll get it.

937
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,884
Are you good, buddy?

938
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:46,860
(Ed)
Nobody's going anywhere.
We'll wait.

939
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,160
We wait for what?

940
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,291
Chief Eagleheart's monster.

941
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,894
I don't believe
in no monster. Do you, Ed?

942
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,905
What do you think,
numb nuts?

943
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,669
Hell no,
I don't believe in a monster.

944
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:04,975
I know damn well
there's a bear up here.
And he's gonna come back.

945
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:08,279
Like the man said,

946
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:13,084
my experience has told me
is, bear will not pass up
a nice free meal.

947
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,184
Boys, we got a lot
of red meat right here.

948
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,206
Take the knife.

949
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,799
Heat the blood up
in a fire.

950
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,844
Take it up wind.

951
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:49,889
I'm sorry, guys.
This is farther than I thought.

952
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,621
We, uhm,
have to make camp here.
It's getting dark.

953
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,296
(Jay)
What about over there?

954
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:57,663
(Rich)
By the tree?

955
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:00,430
Good idea.
Let's check it out.

956
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,737
[coughs]

957
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,239
It stinks.

958
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,307
It smells
like something died.

959
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:14,714
Sure it does.

960
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:21,613
Let me see.

961
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,488
(Jay)
What the hell is that?

962
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,087
Okay, this is sick.
What is that?

963
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,632
(Rich)
We have to get the hell
out of here, man.

964
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,759
What? Let me see,
let me see.

965
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,860
(Rich)
C'mon!

966
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,029
C'mon, man!

967
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,005
I think it's moving.
It's moving.

968
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,907
[shouting]

969
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,310
Get out of here!

970
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:48,180
[thriller music]

971
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,386
Jenny!

972
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,456
Shea!

973
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,567
[girl shouts]

974
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,946
[grunts]

975
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,499
Be very quiet, okay?
You got it?

976
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,002
You got to get
yourself together.

977
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,166
Sh.

978
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,575
[owl hoots]

979
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,637
Jenny, it's gonna smell me.

980
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,077
[whispering]
What?

981
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:59,110
It's gonna smell me.
I've got my period.

982
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,618
That's the least
of our problems, okay?

983
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,752
[whispering]
We have to wait
for the guys.

984
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,558
We're gonna die out here.
I know it, I know it.

985
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:13,762
[whispering]
No, we're not
gonna die out there.

986
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,551
Thought I told you
to tie him up.

987
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,595
[grunting]

988
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,687
Did you hear that?

989
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,294
(Tom )
Not like an animal
I've ever heard.

990
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,064
(Manny )
And human neither.

991
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,037
You both shut up
and listen.

992
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,031
Manny, give me
my gun.

993
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:55,836
What you're gonna do?

994
01:06:55,912 --> 01:06:59,040
I said just to pass it.

995
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,379
[grunt]

996
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:05,515
Save your damn ammo.

997
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,351
[growl]

998
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,288
I ain't dying
like Leo.

999
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:16,455
(Ed)
Where're you going?
Hey, Tom!

1000
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:20,764
[growling]
[Tom shouts]

1001
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,031
[shouting]
[grunting]

1002
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,436
Tom!

1003
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,913
(Manny)
Tom?

1004
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,246
I think I got something.

1005
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:47,521
Oh, my God.
No!

1006
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,861
Tom!
Tom.

1007
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,199
Stupid fool.

1008
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,869
You did this!
Huh?

1009
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:06,005
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me?

1010
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,516
I will, Ed.
I will.
You're the one.

1011
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:12,014
That disappoints me, Manny.

1012
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:15,046
All my friends are dead

1013
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,891
'cause of you.

1014
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,959
I'm your friend, Manny.

1015
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,980
I am your friend.

1016
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,245
[bang]

1017
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,785
Okay.
[out of breath]

1018
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,125
I don't know what happened.
We all got chased by something.

1019
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:57,029
We all got split up.

1020
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,760
I don't know
what it was.

1021
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,837
Mr. Vancamp,
if you're watching this,

1022
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,569
we sure as hell
better get an A for this crap.

1023
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:13,214
I'm freezing.

1024
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,080
[owl hoots]

1025
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,754
What are we gonna do?

1026
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,559
Just wait, I guess.

1027
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,894
[loud growling]

1028
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,508
Did you hear that?

1029
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,279
I can't,
I cannot--

1030
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,645
[whispering]
Shea, Shea,
don't go!

1031

if you look at the research
that we actually did

you'll see that we went
