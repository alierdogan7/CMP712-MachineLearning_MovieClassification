00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
MORNING, CONSUL.

5
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,000
HOW GOES YOUR DAY?

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
( grunting )

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,100
STOP!

8
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,200
I AM SO PROUD
OF YOU.

9
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,300
OUR NAME IS REDEEMED.
THE REPUBLIC IS SAFE.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
IT WAS HORRIBLE,
MOTHER.

11
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,300
HE WOULDN'T DIE.
( shudders )

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,500
BUT HE IS DEAD
NOW, EH?

13
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
HE TRIED TO SPEAK TO ME.

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,300
BUT NO WORDS CAME OUT.

15
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,900
WE MUST BE STRONG NOW.

16
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,100
YES.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,200
THE SENATE WILL LOOK
TO US FOR LEADERSHIP.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
THE PEOPLE WILL NEED
A FIRM HAND.

19
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
HM?

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
ARE YOU UP
TO THE TASK?

21
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,500
( sobbing )

22
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,700
DOMINUS.

23
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,000
( sobbing )

24
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,700
WHO ARE YOU?
WHOSE CHILD IS THIS?

25
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,800
WHAT DID YOU DO?
LET HIM GO, LET HIM GO!

26
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,800
- ( grunting )
- NO, NO, DON'T!

27
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,900
PLEASE HAVE MERCY.

28
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
( sobbing )

29
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,800
I CURSE YOU.
CURSE YOU.

30
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,500
( spits )

31
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,800
I CURSE YOU ALL!

32
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,400
BY ALL THE GODS BELOW.

33
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,100
I CURSE YOU
TO DAMNATION.

34
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,900
( all crying )

35
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900

Man:
CAESAR IS DEAD!
CAESAR IS DEAD!

37
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
HE'S DEAD!
HE'S DEAD!

38
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,700
CAESAR IS DEAD!

39
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,700
 <i>( garbled shouting )</i>

40
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Man:
 <i>LEAVE IT, FORGET IT.</i>

41
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,700
Man:
 <i>YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID!</i>

42
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,100
( sobbing )

43
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,300
MOTHER?

44
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,400
LEAVE ME ALONE.

45
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,200
GODS, NOT YOU AS WELL?
CRYING WILL NOT HELP US.

46
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,600
I'M NOT CRYING.
I'M ANGRY.

47
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,500
MAY DIS DEVOUR
THAT BITCH PIG SERVILIA.

48
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
WHAT A FOOL I WAS.

49
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,500
IF I'D NOT TOLD HER
OF VORENUS AND HIS WIFE...

50
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,300
LISTEN TO ME.
WE MUST NEVER SPEAK
OF OUR PART IN THIS.

51
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,500
IT MAY BE MISTAKEN
FOR COMPLICITY.

52
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- <i>( door opens )</i>

53
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
I'LL SEE HER
EATEN BY DOGS.

54
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
WE MAY HOPE.

55
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,400
DOMINUS,
TIMON IS HERE.

56
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
TIMON, GOOD OF YOU
TO COME.

57
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,800
( panting )
I GRIEVE WITH YOU.

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
- BAD BUSINESS.
- IT IS.

59
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,700
YOUR MOTHER'S
ALL RIGHT, IS SHE?

60
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
SHE'S NOT
RECEIVING VISITORS.

61
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,600
BUT SHE'S WELL ENOUGH.
HAVE YOU MEN WITH YOU?

62
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
10. SO, SHE'S
ALL RIGHT, THEN?

63
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,800
AS I SAID.
HOW'S THE CITY?

64
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,300
ALL'S INDOORS.
EVERYWHERE'S DEAD QUIET.

65
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,400
TIMON, THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

66
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I AM SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

67
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,600
I CAME AS SOON
AS I HEARD.

68
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,300
I GRIEVE WITH YOU.

69
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,500
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,
THANK YOU.

70
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,200
ARE THE STREETS SAFE?
CAN WE GET OUT OF THE CITY?

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
- WE CAN.
- <i>WE SHOULD WAIT A WHILE,</i>

72
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION.
WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR VIEW
OF THE POSITION.

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,800
- ANTONY MAY WELL--
-  ANTONY WERE ALIVE,
 HE WOULD COME TO ME.

74
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
OR SEND WORD,
AT LEAST.

75
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
I MUST ASSUME
ANTONY IS DEAD.

76
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE,
BUT WE CANNOT KNOW
THAT AS YET.

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
PERHAPS HE'S
FLED THE CITY.

78
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,200
AND LEAVE ME HERE?
NEVER.

79
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,000
PUT ON YOUR
TRAVELING CLOTHES.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,300
- NOTHING FANCY.
- MOTHER, THINK.

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,100
YOU HEARD WHAT SERVILIA SAID.
SHE WANTS YOU TO RUN AWAY.

82
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
MORE FOOL HER.
LET HER TRY TO FIND ME.

83
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,900
SHE WILL FIND YOU.
YOU HAVE NO TALENT FOR HIDING.

84
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,800
CASTOR, PACK THE MONEY
AND THE HOUSEHOLD GODS.

85
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,100
IMMEDIATELY,
DOMINA.

86
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
COME ALONG,
NO TIME TO WASTE.

87
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,000
( panting )

88
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,500
( spits )

89
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
ANTONY.

90
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,000
I SWEAR ON THE BLACK STO
THAT I WILL KILL THEM ALL.

91
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,000
BRUTUS AND CASSIUS
AND CASCA AND THE WHOLE
DAMN LOT OF THEM.

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,900
EY'RE JUST
SERVILIA'S MINIONS.
THIS IS ALL HER DOING.

93
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,300
I TOLD CAESAR.

94
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
I TOLD HIM
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I SWEAR, I WILL PISS
ON THEM AS THEY DIE.

96
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,200
THAT I-- I SHOULD
HAVE RUN AND HIDE

97
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,500
FROM THOSE--
THOSE WORMS.

98
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,000
ARE YOU CERTAIN?
ARE YOU CERTAIN SURE
HE'S DEAD?

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,300
OH, YEAH.
HE'S DEAD ALL RIGHT.

100
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
I WAS THERE,
I SAW HIM.

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,700
YOU WERE THERE?

102
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
BUT THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU STOP THEM?

103
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,400
I-I WASN'T THERE.

104
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,200
I WAS--
THEY DELAYED ME

105
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,100
OUTSIDE ON THE STEPS.
BY THE TIME I GOT INSIDE
THE DEED HAD BEEN DONE.

106
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,100
AND THE LICTORS HAD ALL
RUN OFF LIKE RABBITS.

107
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
THAT TREACHEROUS
BASTARD VORENUS,

108
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
PAID OFF.

109
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,000
HE'D LEFT US
BEFORE WE EVEN GOT
TO THE SENATE HOUSE.

110
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,600
HE WAS LURED AWAY.

111
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,000
THE WITCH SERVILIA'S WOMAN
TOLD HIM AN EVIL TALE
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

112
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,300
- OH.
- WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?

113
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,000
WHAT DID I DO?

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
WHY, NOTHING
I COULD DO.

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
CAESAR WAS DEAD.
I WAS UNARMED.

116
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,300
WELL I WOULD HAVE...

117
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,600
RIPPED THEM TO PIECES
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

118
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

119
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,600

12 MANGY DOGS
CAN KILL A LION.

120
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
WELL, IF YOU SAY SO.

121
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,300
WHAT SHALL WE
DO NOW?

122
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE.

123
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
I WILL GO NORTH...

124
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,100
AND RAISE AN ARMY
OF MONSTERS.

125
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,700
THEN I WILL
COME BACK HERE

126
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
AND I WILL CRUCIFY
EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE
SONS OF BITCHE

127
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I MAY "DO AS I LIKE"?

128
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,400
WHY ARE YOU HERE
IF I MAY DO AS I LIKE?

129
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I MEANT NOTHING.
OF COURSE I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,500
PLEASE,  YOU'D RATHER
TAKE SOME OTHER LOVER,
I WILL NOT PROTEST.

131
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,400
OH, I MEANT ONLY THAT--

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
THAT I CANNOT FORCE YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,100
THAT'S WHERE YOU WER
THESE LAST HOURS, I SUPPOSE?

134
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,700
PUTTING YOUR WHORES INTO--
INTO BAGGAGE CARTS.

135
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,900
I HAVE NO STOMACH
FOR A FIGHT WITH YOU.

136
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,600
NOT NOW, EH?

137
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
I DON'T WANT
TO GO NORTH.

138
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,100
THE NORTH IS GHASTLY.

139
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
( chuckles )

140
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
- TIMON.

141
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
TIMON, WE'RE GOING NORTH.
YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL
PROTECT THE FAMILY

142
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,800
UNTIL I CAN GATHER
MY OWN PEOPLE TOGETHER.

143
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,300
- IT'LL COST YOU.
- OF COURSE.

144
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,600
I EXPECT NO PUBLIC
SERVICE FROM A JEW.

145
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
WE SHALL BE TAKING
CALPURNIA WITH US, SO WE
MUST LEAVE VIA THE SUBURA.

146
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,100
CALPURNIA?

147
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,700
 <i>BUT WHY DO WE NEED</i>
 <i>TO TAKE HER?</i>

148
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
WE MUST BE SURE
THAT SHE IS SAFE.

149
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,100
WELL, I DON'T SEE HER
RUSHING TO SEE THAT
WE'RE SAFE.

150
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,100
MY DEA WE CANNOT LEAVE
CAESAR'S WIDOW BEHIND.

151
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,900
IT WOULD LOOK ILL WITH
THE PEOPLE, AS IF WE'D
ABANDONED HER.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
WHAT A BORE.

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
( singing in Latin )

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
( grunts )
FATHER.

155
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,100
FATHER, WAKE ME.

156
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
- HUSH.
- WAKE ME.

157
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
HUSH NOW,
BE CALM.

158
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,300
I WILL WAKE YOU
IF YOU WILL LET ME GO.

159
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,400
PROMISE ME.

160
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
ON THE FIRE OF VESTA,
I PROMISE.

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
( singing in Latin )

162
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
LOVELY.

163
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THANK YOU.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,500
I KNOW I DIDN'T GET US
STARTED OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT--

165
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,900
KILLING YOUR MAN AND ALL,
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

166
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,800
BUT, VA, I'LL JUST COME
STRAIGHT OUT WITH IT.

167
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,900
I HAVE A QUESTION
TO ASK YOU.

168
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,100
WITH PERMISSION
OF VENUS AND MARS...

169
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,100
I ASK YOU
TO BE MY WIFE.

170
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
YOUR WIFE?
MARRIED?

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,100
MARRIED.
YOU AND ME.

172
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,000
IF-- IF YOU
WISH IT SO, MASTER.

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
NO NO NO, I'M NOT
YOUR MASTER ANYMORE.
YORE A FREE WOMAN.

174
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,900
YOU CAN REFUSE ME,
I WON'T BE ANGRY.

175
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,500
WELL, I WON'T BE BEST
PLEASED, BUT YOU KNOW,

176
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,400
I WON'T BEAT YOU
OR ANYTHING.

177
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,200
A MAN LIKE ME
CAN ALWAYS MAKE
GOOD MONEY.

178
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,400
YOU'LL HAVE A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD, FOOD.

179
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,800
I'LL BUY YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT, DRESSES, SHOES.

180
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,300
IS THAT A YES?

181
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
YES.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
( laughs )
YOU WON'T REGRET IT,
I PROMISE.

183
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
DONE.

184
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500

HOW GOOD OF YOU TO COME,

MY HUSBAND IS GLAD
TO RECEIVE YOU.

196
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,900
YOU'RE THE FIRST
TO PAY RESPECTS.

197
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,500
STRANGE THAT NONE
OF OUR FRIENDS OR
FAMILY HAVE COME.

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THEY'RE AFRAID.

199
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,100

THAT MAY BE SO.

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,500
WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE
THE CITY NOW.

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
IT'S BEST YOU
COME WITH US.

203
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,700
LEAVING?
WHY?

204
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,500
IT IS NOT SAFE.

205
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,900
WELL, THAT'S NO MATTER.
I'M GLAD TO DIE.

206
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,500
MY DEAR LADY...

207
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,900
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE
HERE TO STAND WITNESS,
WE MUST READ HIS WILL.

208
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,400
HIS WILL?

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
NO, I'M SORRY.
WE HAVEN'T TIME.

210
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,600
- IT IS THE PROPER FORM.
- WE HAVEN'T TIME.

211
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
IT IS THE WILL...

212
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,000
OF A DICTATOR
OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,600
HAVING MADE DUE

WELL-BEING AND SECURITY

214
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,200

I LEAVE THE SUM OF
75 DENARII TO EVERY

216
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,700
OH, RIDICULOUS.
WHAT A WASTE.

217
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,200
MY NAME

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,100
OCTAVIAN?
MY OCTAVIAN?

226
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
WHAT ELSE?

227
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,300
HE STIPULATES THAT THE
SLAVE KNOWN AS POSCA--

228
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,900
THAT IS I-- AM TO BE
GIVEN MY LIBERTY

THERE ARE NO FURTHER
BEQUESTS.

233
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,400
I SEE.

234
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,500
WELL,
CONGRATULATIONS, BOY.

235
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,900
THANK YOU, POSCA.

236

 <i>( door opens )</i>

237
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
OCTAVIAN GETS EVERYTHING?
ALL OF IT?

238
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,600
HE'LL GET NOTHING.
IT'S ALL WAX FOR SAPING.

239
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,200
IT'S A WILL.
IT-- IT'S HIS BY LAW.

240
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
THE LAW IS NOW BRUTUS
AND HIS MINIONS.

241
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,000
CAESAR'S LAND AND MONEY
WILL GO TO THEM.

242
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
THAT IS SO.
THEY WILL DECLARE HIS DEATH
A RIGHTFUL TYRANNICIDE,

243
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,200
HIS WILL AND ALL HIS ACTS
BECOME NULL AND VOID,

244
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
HIS PROPERTY WILL BE
INTESTATE.

245
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,600
- THEY CANNOT TAKE THE NAME.
- Antony: <i>OH NO.</i>

246
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,100
THAT'S ALL YOURS.

247
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,200
MUCH GOOD
MAY IT DO YOU.

248
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,800
- AWAY NOW.
- ( sighs )

249
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,600
I MAY HAVE TO TAKE
CALPURNIA ALONG BY FORCE,

250
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,400
SO DON'T BE ALARMED
IF SHE MAKES A CLAMOR.

251
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
HEY, SEND
FOR YOUR MISTRESS.

252
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
TELL HER WE'RE LEAVING.

253
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,800
MOTHER, I MUST STAY
IN ROME.

254
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,800
- EH?
- I MUST STAY IN ROME.

255
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,100
I AM CAESAR'S SON.
I MUST PROTECT MY STATUS
AND RIGHTS.

256
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,500
THERE'S BLOOD.
A PROPER LITTLE SPARTAN.

257
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,700
YOU SHALL HAVE TO
STAY ALSO, MOTHER.

258
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,300
THE FAMILY MUST
APPEAR UNITED.

259
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,200
OH MY STRANGE, BRAVE, POMPOUS
LITTLE BOY, WE'RE GOING NORTH.

260
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
I'M HEAD OF THE FAMILY.

261
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,300
STRICTLY SPEAKING, IT IS
FOR ME TO SAY WHERE WE GO.

262
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,800
I KNOW YOU'RE ONLY TRYING
TO BE MANLY, THAT'S LOVELY.

263
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,500
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME.
WE ARE GOING AND THERE'S
AN END ON IT.

264
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
ANTONY LISTEN, BRUTUS
IS IN A LEGAL BIND.

265
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,600
I THINK WE CAN FORCE HIM
INTO MAKING A DEAL WITH US.

266
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,000
GO ON.

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,900
BRUTUS MUST DECLARE CAESAR
A TYRANT OR ELSE THE ACT
OF KILLING CAESAR IS MURDER.

268
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,700
BUT ALL THE ACTS OF
A TYRANT ARE UNLAWFUL,

269
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,200
INCLUDING THOSE APPOINTING
BRUTUS AS PRAETOR,

270
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,700
CASSIUS AS PROCONSUL,

271
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,000
- AND SO FORTH.
- AND THEN SO?

272
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
IF BRUTUS HONORS
THE LAW,

273
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,000
HE LOSES ALL RANK
AND POSITION.

274
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
IT'S LAWYERS' PRATTLE.

275
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,600
I DON'T THINK SO.
IF YOU OFFER THEM AMNESTY

276
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,800
- IN RETURN--
- AMNESTY?

277
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,800
I'M GONNA EAT
THEIR LIVERS.
AMNESTY?

278
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING ME.

279
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,300
ENOUGH! YOU THINK YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN ANTONY?

280
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,900
- BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- JUNO'S CUNT, MUST I SLAP YOU?

281
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,300
IF THE WILL STANDS,
AND IT MIGHT,

282
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
YOU ARE MOTHER TO
THE RICHEST MAN IN ROME.

283
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,200
IF THE WILL IS BROKEN,
SERVILIA HAS THAT HONOR.

284
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,300
NO.

285
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
WHERE IS THIS
DAMN WOMAN?

286
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,300
WHEN I GIVE YOU THE NOD,
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME
SEIZE THE OLD LADY

287
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,100
AND GET HER GETSIDE QUICK.
SHE TRUSTS YOU, NAY?

288
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,000
- SIR, WILL ALL RESPECT...
- WHAT?

289
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 <i>WITH ALL RESPECT,</i>
 <i>UNTIL THE WILL IS RATIFIED,</i>

290

 <i>THE HOUSE OF CAESAR.</i>
 <i>WITH THAT IN MIND,</i>

291
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,700
I MUST BEG YOU NOT TO TAKE
MY MISTRESS BY FORCE.

292
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,000
- WITH ALL RESPECT.
- RESPECT?

293
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,200
YOU IMPUDENT TOAD.

294
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,800
YOU'LL DO AS I SAY,
AND I WILL DO AS I PLEASE
WITH YOUR DAMN MISTRESS.

295
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,900
ANTONY?

296
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,100
WE'RE STAYING.

298
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,600
NO THANK YOU, MASTER.

299
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
CALLING ME THAT.

300
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,500
WHAT SHALL I
CALL YOU THEN?

301
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,500
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

302
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,200

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,400
SHE'LL BE
WELL RESPECTED.

IMMORTALS, I SAY.

320
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,900
YOU NOBLEMEN HAVE
CARVED YOUR NAMES

321
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,200
DEEP IN THE
ETERNAL STONE.

322
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
THAT IS VERY HIGH
PRAISE INDEED.

323
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
I WOULD EMBRACE YOU ALL
BUT I'M DESOLATED

324
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,000
THAT YOU DID NOT ENLIST ME
IN YOUR COHORT OF HEROES.

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,500
TO WIELD THE
LIBERATORS' KNIFE--

326
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,300
WHAT JOY YOU
HAVE DENIED ME.

327
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,700
OH, FORGIVE US.

328
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,800
BUT WE RATHER THOUGHT
YOU'D PREFER NOT TO KNOW.

329
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
IT IS DONE.

330
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,500
I CANNOT SHARE
IN YOUR GLORY.

331
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
I CAN ONLY APPLAUD.

333
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,100

THE DOG, IS DEAD I HOPE?

338

- <i>HE IS NOT.</i>
- MARK ANTONY IS ALIVE?

339
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,500
AN ERROR!

340
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,900
I THINK,
A DEEP ERROR.

WE ARE SENATORS,
NOT HIRED THUGS.

342
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,100

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,600
WELL, WELL YOU
KNOW BEST WHAT IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

344
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
I-I MUST GO.
I'M AWAY TO THE COUNTRY.

 <i>ANOTHER TEDIOUS LAWSUIT.</i>
 <i>I JUST WANTED TO SALUTE YOU</i>

356
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,400
SHE'S MOTHER

GOING TO KILL HER.

358
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,900
I HAD THE KNIFE
IN MY HAND.

359
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,700
SHE DID IT HERSELF.

360
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
MISERIA.

361
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,300
- WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?
- GONE.

362

363
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
I CURSED THEM.

364
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,900

I AM HERE

371
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
STRICTLY AS AN
IMPARTIAL ARBITER.

372
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,600
I KNEW NOTHING OF
THIS DISTURBING ACT.

373
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,500
OH?

374
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,600
I WAS AS SURPRISED AND--
AND SHOCKED AS YOU WERE.

375
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,200
 <i>AS BRUTUS CAN CONFIRM.</i>

376
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,400
UH, CICERO KNEW NOTHING.

377
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,600
YOU HAVE LOST A GOOD
FRIEND AND PATRON TODAY.

378
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,100
 <i>WE ARE SORRY.</i>

379
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,400
IF THAT MONKEY REMAINS
I SHALL HAVE TO EN HIS NECK.

00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,000
HE TRIED TO
KILL ME THIS MORNING.
HIS PRESENCE IS AN INSULT.

381
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,900
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
NO ONE TRIED TO KILL YOU.

382
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,700
IT WAS MY EXPRESS ORDER
THAT YOU BE SPARED.

383
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,700
AM I, CASSIUS?
MISTAKEN?

384
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600

390
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,400
WHY SO QUIET?

391
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,200
A TYRANT IS DEAD.

392
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
SURELY THE PEOPLE
SHOULD BE HAPPY.

393
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,800
WHERE IS THE CHEERING THRONG
AT YOUR DOOR?

394
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,700
WHERE ARE THE JOYOUS CRIES
OF LIBERTY? HM?

395
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
 <i>THE PEOPLE FEAR CHANGE.</i>

396
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
A SOMBER MOOD
IS ONLY NATURAL.

397
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,900
WHEN THEY REALIZE
THEY ARE FREE FROM TYRANNY,

398
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,200
THE PEOPLE WILL BE GLAD.

399
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,700
THE PEOPLE LOVED CAESAR.

400
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,600
AND THEY WILL HATE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

401
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,200
THEY LOVED HIM ONCE.
AS I DID.

402
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
OH, SOME HAVE TURNED
AGAINST HIM, NO DOUBT.

403
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,700
IT CANNOT BE DENIED HE WAS
SOMETHING OF A TYRANT.

404
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,900
BUT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WILL
WORSHIP CAESAR UNTIL THEY DIE.

405
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
 <i>A GREAT MANY.</i>

406
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,700
AND THOSE PEOPLE
ARE MINE NOW.

407
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,400
WE DO NOT NEED
SUCH PEOPLE.

408

 <i>OUR MEN-AT-ARMS</i>

ONLY RALLY THE BAKERS

414
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400

A FESTIVAL.

415

416
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
WHAT ELECTIONS?

417
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,800
SURELY YOU'VE THOUGHT
THIS THROUGH?

418
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,700
IF CAESAR WAS,
AS YOU INSIST, A TYRANT,

419
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,400
THEN ALL HIS ACTS
AND APPOINTMENTS
ARE NULLIFIED.

420
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,900
I AM NO LONGER CONSUL,

421
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,000
YOU'RE NO LONGER PRAETOR,
YOU'RE NO LONGER PROCONSUL.

422
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
ELECTIONS WILL
HAVE TO BE HELD.

423
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,600
THAT IS SO.

424
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,800
MESSY THINGS,
ELECTIONS.

425
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,500
YOU SPOKE OF HELPING US?

426
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?


430
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
NEITHER OF US

431
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,600
NOT WITHOUT MUCH BLOOD
SPILLED TO PROVE THE ISSUE.

432
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,800
I WANT NO MORE BLOOD.

433
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,700
I WANT PEACE

434
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,300
HOW?

435
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,800
FIRST,
A GENERAL AMNESTY.

436
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,400

THEN A SHOW OF UNITY.
A PUBLIC FUNERAL FOR CAESAR,

TOGETHER.

513
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,400
WHERE ELSE
THEY GONNA GO?

514
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,900
COURSE THEY'RE
COMING BACK.

515
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,900
TOMORROW,
AT THE FOURTH HOUR,

516
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,600
A FUNERAL SERVICE
WILL BE HELD FOR

517
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR.

518
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,900
UNDER TERMS OF TRU
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF UNITY

519
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,600
AND FORGIVENESS,
EULOGIES WILL BE DELIVERED

520
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,100
BY PRAETOR
MARCUS JUNIUS BRUNUS

521
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,300
AND CONSUL
MARK ANTONY.

522
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,000
NO PROSTITUTES, ACTORS

523
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,200
OR UNCLEAN
TRADESMEN MAY ATTEND.

524
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,400
I AM COME TO PAY
MY RESPECTS TO YOUR HUSBAND.

525
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,600
( spits )

526
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,100
I UNDERSTAND
YOU ARE GRIEVING.

527
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,600
( spits )

528
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
SHOW HER
WHAT SHE'S DONE.

529
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,300
SO VORENUS WENT HOME
TO CONFRONT HIS WIFE

530
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,000
AND CAESAR WENT TO THE SENATE
ALONE AND UNPROTECTED.

531
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,800
BASTARDS.

532
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,300
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

533
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,600
IS HOW THEY KNEW
ABOUT NIOBE AND ALL THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

534
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
YOU AND I WERE THE ONLY
ONES THAT KNEW THE TRUTH.

535
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,900
I TOLD MY SISTER.

536
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,700
AND SHE TOLD SERVILIA.

537
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,700
MY SISTER WAS--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

538
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
THE JUG IS BROKEN,
I CANNOT MEND IT
WITH REGRET.

539
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,800
I ASK FOR YOUR
FORGIVENESS.

540
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,300
OF COURSE.

541
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,400
I CAN'T EXPECT A YOUNG LAD
LIKE YOURSELF TO BE--

542
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,700
TO BE--
ANYWAY,

543
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,700
IT'S DONE,
AS YOU SAY.

544
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,100
YOU SHOULD NOT REPEAT
WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU.

545
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,900
IT'S NOT THAT I'M ASHAMED,
THOUGH I AM.

546
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,500
IT'S ONLY THAT
IT WILL NOT LOOK GOOD
WITH THE PEOPLE.

547
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
IT'S FORGOTTEN ALREADY.

548
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,700
SORRY ABOUT YOUR UNCLE.

549
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,300
I AM MADE HIS SON
BY WILL.

550
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,500
OH.

551
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,300
CONGRATULATIONS.

552
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,100
YOU'LL BE WANTING
VENGEANCE, THEN?

553
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
AT SOME POINT.

554
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,100
I'LL BE UP FOR
THE DUTY, OF COURSE.

555
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,100
( praying in Latin )

556
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,400
OH COME ON, GET UP.

557
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,600
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT DAY IT IS?

558
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,400
OH,
WHAT DAY IS IT?

559
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,700
DON'T PLAY WITH ME.
I'M NOT UP FOR IT TODAY.

560
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,600
AH.
RELAX.

561
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
IT'S GONNA BE MY DAY.

562
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,900
I CAN FEEL IT.

563
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,600
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER FUCKED A WOMAN

564
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,200
IN A FUNERAL DRESS
BEFORE.

565
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
NOR SHALL YOU NOW.

566
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
THAT'S A SHAME.

567
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,200
IT'LL HAVE TO BE
MERULA THEN.

568
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,700
COME HERE, OLD GIRL.
JUMP ON.

569
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,200
- SHE'D EAT YOU ALIVE.
- HM.

570
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,600
COME ON, THIS IS
NO MORNING FOR FOOLERY.
JUST GET UP.

571
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,400
OH COME HERE.

572
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,400
STOP FOOLING AROUND
AND JUSTET UP!

573
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I AM NOT RISING
FROM THIS BED

574
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,800
UNTIL I'VE FUCKED
SOMEONE.

575
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,900
FINE, FINE. MERULA,
FETCH THAT GERMAN SLUT
FROM THE KITCHEN.

576
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
COME ON,
GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME

577
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,100
OR YOU'LL BE NEXT
FOR THE "KING OF GOATS"
OVER THERE.

578
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,100
UNDERTAKER'S HERE.
WE'RE READY TO GO.

579
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,100
WE MUST WAIT
FOR THE CHILDREN.

580
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,800
THEY'LL BE BACK,
BROTHER.

581
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,900
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

582
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,100
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
CURSED THEM.

583
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,200
THEY'LL BE BACK.
I'M SURE OF IT.
SOONER OR LATER.

584
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

585
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,400
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.

586
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,800
HEY,EY, HEY.

587
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,700
HEY.

588
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,000
WE'VE GOT TO SEND
NIOBE ON HER WAY NOW.

589
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,800
WE CAN'T LEAVE IT
ANY LONGER, CAN WE?

590
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,300
ELSE THEM BELOW
WILL BE VEXED.

591
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,700
PLEASE.
PLEASE.

592
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,800
 <i>( women chanting</i>
 <i>in Latin )</i>

593
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,400

594
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,500
 <i>( people cheering )</i>

595

596
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,900
GRAIN MONITOR?

597
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,200
WHY ON GAIA'S EARTH WOULD
I WANT TO BE GRAIN MONITOR?

598
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,000
IT WOULD GIVE YOU
REASON TO LEAVE THE CITY
WITH DIGNITY.

599
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LEAVING THE CITY.

600
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,700
A TOUR OF THE ASIAN
SUPPLY PORTS

601
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,300
WOULD BE THE MOST
NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD.

602
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,200
NOBODY COULD
POSSIBLY ACCUSE YOU
OF RUNNING AWAY.

603
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,900
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LEAVING THE CITY!

604
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,500
SERVILIA, MY DEAR...

605
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,100
 <i>SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.</i>

606
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,100
( sighs )

607
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,400
GOT A BIT CARRIED AWAY.

608
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
YOU GA
AN EXCELLENT SPEECH,

609
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,400
INCIDENTALLY.

610
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,700
IT WAS PERHAPS
A TOUCH TOO CEREBRAL

611
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,000
FOR THAT AUDIENCE,
BUT...

612
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,800
HAVE YOU BEEN OFFERED
ANY REFRESHMENT?

613
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,900
AH, SOME WATER
WILL BE LOVELY.

614
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,000
THANK YOU.

615
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,400
PLEASE, SPEAK SENSE
TO YOUR SON.

616
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,400
HIM AND HIS FRIENDS
MUST LEAVE THE CITY.

617
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,700
I CANNOT ANSWER
FOR THEIR SAFETY.

618
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,500
DO NOT LOOK SO PLEASED
WITH YOURSELF.

619
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,300
YOU'RE A LIAR
AND A BREAKER OF OATHS,

620
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,400
AND YOU'VE ROUSED YOUR RABBLE,
NOTHING MORE.

621
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
A PANTOMIME ACTOR MIGHT HAVE
DONE WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

622
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
LUCKY THEN IT WAS ME
THAT DID IT, EH?

623
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,300
ELSE YOU WOULD NOW BE
ON YOUR KNEES SUCKING
PANTOMIME COCK.

624
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,600
I HAVE NO WISH TO ABUSE
OR HUMILIATE YOU.

625
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,300
 <i>I ONLY WISH YOU GONE.</i>

626
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,300
WE'RE GOING NOWHERE.

627
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,700
HM. NO, NOT YOU,
AT LEAST.

628
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,200
THE MEN SHALL LEAVE.

629
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,200
YOU WILL STAY HERE
IN THE CITY WITH ME

630
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,200
AS MY GUEST.

631
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,500
( laughs )
HOSTAGE, YOU MEAN.

632
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,500
 <i>AS YOU LIKE.</i>

633
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,400
YOU MAY WISH AS YOU WILL.

634
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,200
WE YET HAVE ALL
THE SENATE BEHIND US

635
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,700
 <i>AND ALL THE MEN</i>
 <i>OF QUALITY.</i>

636
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,900
AND I HAVE
AN ANGRY MOB...

637
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,000
THAT WILL ROAST AND EAT
YOUR "MEN OF QUALITY"

638
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,200
IN THE ASHES OF
THE SENATE HOUSE!

639
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,400
 <i>( cup crashes )</i>

640
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,600
CHILDREN?
ELDEST?

641
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,100
VORENA?

642
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,600
THEY'RE NOT HE.

643
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,700
NEVER MIND.
JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

644
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,400
HOW ABOUT YOU MAKE US
A NICE POT OF PORRIDGE?

645
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,800
WE'LL ALL FEEL BETTER
WITH SOME FOOD INSIDE US.

 <i>( metal clanging )</i>

647
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:46,700

 <i>( clattering )</i>

649

650
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,100
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
I WAS ONLY TAKING BACK
THINGS I LENT.

651
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,300
HUSH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE
CHILDREN HAVE RUN TO?

652
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,000
I SWEAR,
ONLY THINGS I LENT.

653
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,300
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE CHILDREN ARE?

654
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
SPEAK!

655
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,400
ERASTES' FOREMEN
TOOK THEM.

656
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,800
( whispering )
PORCA JUNO.

657
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,700
I'M VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

658
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,300
( horse whinnies )

659
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,800
AYE, AYE, AYE, RIGHT.
THE PLACE IS FUCKING
PACKED, YEAH?

660
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,400
TAKES ME HALF AN HOUR TO
FIGHT MY WAY TO THE FRONT

661
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,200
AND UP STEPS BRUTUS.

662
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,300
HA! RIGHT?

663
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,400
AND HE GOES,
"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

664
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,400
THE LAW THIS
AND THE REPUBLIC THAT.

665
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,400
AND THE 12 BLOODY TABLES."
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
HALF OF IT.

666
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,200
YEAH, YEAH,
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

667
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,200
THEN, ANTONY'S UP.
BUT HE GIVES BRUTUS A HUG.

668
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,700
 <i>HE STARTS TALKING</i>
 <i>ALL CALM AND GENTLE</i>
 <i>LIKE HE'S NOT BOTHERED.</i>

669
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,300
AND I'M THINKING,
"BOLLOCKS TO THIS. WE'LL BE
AWAY FOR A BEVY."

670
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,800
BUT THEN...

671
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,900
HE PULLS OUT
CAESAR'S TOGA,

672
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,600
ALL COVERED IN BLOOD.

673
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,800
EVERYONE GOES,
"WHOA!"

674
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,900
DISGUSTING.
 FUCKING DIGNITY, THAT MAN.

675
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,300
BUT NOW, ANTONY'S STALKING
UP AND DOWN WITH THE TOGA

676
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,900
AND HE'S CRYING ABOUT
"WHAT A GOOD MAN WAS CAESAR"

677
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,800
AND HOW MUCH HE LOVES HIM
AND WHAT A GREAT LEADER
WE'VE LOST

678
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,300
UNTIL THE CROWD--
HALF OF THEM ARE CRYING--

679
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,100
THEY'RE SOBBING
LIKE BABIES.

680
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,600
AND THEN WHAT DOES HE DO?
HE TAKES THE BLOODY TOGA...

681
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,800
AND THROWS IT INTO THE CROWD.
