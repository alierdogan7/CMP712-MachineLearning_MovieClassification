1
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,758
Preceding today's American operations...

2
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,003
...heavy bombers of the Royal
Air Force made a night attack...

3
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:40,267
...on the important marshaling yard at Hamm.

4
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,473
of all British operations...

5
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:50,278
...only 12 of our aircraft failed to return.

6
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,884
Any questions from the correspondents?

7
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,520
Major Davenport.

8
00:02:58,294 --> 00:02:59,727
Ladies and gentlemen...

9
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,855
...I have only limited news on
today's American air operations.

10
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:08,163
In the deepest penetration to date,
strong formations of Flying Fortresses...

11
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:11,535
...were dispatched well beyond the
range of friendly fighter cover...

12
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,405
...to attack key industrial
objectives in Germany.

13
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:20,572
An early estimate indicates that upward
of 200 German fighters were destroyed.

14
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,615
Forty-eight of our bombers are missing.

15
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,252
Forty-eight?

16
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,594
That's all at the present
time, ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:33,854
Let's get out of here.

18
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,625
What do you expect us to write when we
don't even know the name of the target?

19
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,066
Would it be tactless to inquire
what kind of industrial objectives?

20
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:45,232
"Key industrial objectives. "

21
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:48,673
A fine comfort for a lot
of new widows back home.

22
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,942
What do you suppose is there, Brockie?

23
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,981
Is there any one target in
Germany worth 48 bombers?

24
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,981
Worth it to whom?

25
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,482
Casey Dennis?

26
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,588
What's 48 bombers?

27
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:00,814
- Hello, Brockie.
- Hello.

28
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,083
- Hello, Carwood.
- Hi.

29
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,452
Good evening, constable.

30
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:09,026
Maybe they're after something special.

31
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:12,998
If it's that, I'm willing to be shown.
For my money, it's Dennis that's special.

32
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,160
- Taxi.
- What's the answer, Brockie?

33
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,602
All guts and no brain?

34
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,869
No, that's putting it too simply.

35
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:23,706
Dennis is one of those boys
whose brain is fascinated by guts.

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,110
He loves this lousy war.

37
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:27,408
Taxi.

38
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,650
The Savoy. Then King's Cross Station.

39
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,584
If Dennis throws you in the
guardhouse, we'll bail you out.

40
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,156
It's been a long while since
I've talked to the boys.

41
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,523
- Tell the boss I'll phone soon as I get there.
- Right.

42
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,087
Another big one out today?

43
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,127
You ain't kidding. They're
putting everything up that can fly.

44
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:17,755
Thought the boys might have drawn a stand
- down after yesterday.

45
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,264
- Not with old iron butt driving the wagon.
-  Who?

46
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,598
Who do you think? Dennis.

47
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,007
That's the one we seen
come in yesterday, sir.

48
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:01,609
I don't know who was flying it.

49
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,042
Pilot, dead. Copilot, wounded.

50
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,943
About five of them bailed out.

51
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,485
You better drive around the other side.

52
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,054
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,580
What do you think this
is, a sheet-metal shop?

54
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,116
The old man wanted to have
this as soon as I'd done it.

55
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,357
Do you think we're gonna get rest tomorrow?

56
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:52,290
I don't know. They ain't said
yet. But he can't keep this up.

57
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:57,923
In that case, maybe this is the
night I could get that date with Joan.

58
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:01,329
You know she don't like
to date nobody but me.

59
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,069
Three pounds ten, and I'll stay home.

60
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,844
How long will you stay home?

61
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,641
You said £2.10 yesterday.
The price has gone up.

62
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:16,011
So has the price of whiskey.

63
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,783
Fork over.

64
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:28,527
Do you usually take her something
or do you just go by yourself?

65
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,065
Well, if I was you, I'd
take her some peanuts.

66
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,633
Especially if I was you.

67
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,271
General Dennis' office.

68
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:42,639
What? He is? Thanks, Mike.

69
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,177
Beat it.

70
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,673
Hello, Harry.

71
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,182
The tower at the 32nd just
called. The old man's coming in.

72
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,716
Better break it up, you
guys, the old man's back.

73
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,847
Good afternoon, sir.

74
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,754
- Got the signal, Evans?
- Not yet, sir.

75
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,555
The estimated time over target is 12:11.

76
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,858
- Yesterday's strike photo's been plotted?
- Right there, sir.

77
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:27,645
Good.

78
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,921
Right on it. Good.

79
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,562
- I want a set of these for General Kane.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,467
- Anything else?
- Well, sir...

81
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,038
...in this batch of DFCs
approved by General Kane...

82
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,836
...there's one for Captain Lucius Jenks.
- Jenks?

83
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,911
Colonel Haley said you
wanted to see his file, sir.

84
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,506
Call the 32nd and tell them
I want Captain Jenks here.

85
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:55,946
Yes, sir.

86
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,518
And there was this
correspondent, you know the one...

87
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:01,122
I have no time. Tell Public
Relations to handle him.

88
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,780
Yes, sir.

89
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,639
- Flying control. That's right.
- I'll call you as soon as I...

90
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,512
- Bring me all reports on enemy opposition.
-  Yes, sir.

91
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:34,418
That's it. Baker-one-Seven,
High Hat, C-Charlie.

92
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,026
very likely there'll be more. Aircrew
should hardly get their feet wet.

93
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:41,129
Yes. Thanks, chum.

94
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,163
- Strike signal?
- Still sweating it out.

95
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,166
RAF Mosquitoes have reported a
formation of U.S. Fortresses...

96
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,999
...under very heavy fighter attack
15 miles east of Braunschweig.

97
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,142
What's your report on morale, Haley?

98
00:09:57,313 --> 00:10:00,407
After the last two days, they're
too tired to bother about morale.

99
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,051
How many crews are making
their last mission today?

100
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,915
Eleven, if they get back, sir.

101
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,817
Then we lose them anyway.

102
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:14,090
Ted should have his bomb-bay
doors open right now.

103
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:17,329
Strike signal from 7th Combat Wing, sir.

104
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,834
Primary attacked. visibility,
perfect. Results, excellent.

105
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,131
Well, that's two out of three.

106
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,277
That leaves just one to go.

107
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,708
- Check that with command.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,306
Davis, any changes in your 1400 weather map?

109
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:38,584
Well, there's an interesting cold mass
forming eccentrically over the Arctic Sea.

110
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,188
Never mind the genealogy.
How will it affect us?

111
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:44,660
Weather along the coastal fringes
in southern France should be...

112
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,192
I'm not interested in France.

113
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:48,728
What about central and northern Germany?

114
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,990
Right here.

115
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,967
Way in there again, sir? Three days running?

116
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:55,763
Major, I'm consulting you about the weather.

117
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,303
Sorry, sir.

118
00:10:57,473 --> 00:11:00,408
It should be wide open
all the way to Breslau.

119
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,908
Good at our bases all day.

120
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:16,489
Four-forty.

121
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,026
Five-fifty.

122
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,533
I want all leaves canceled
until we know today's losses.

123
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,168
Yes, sir.

124
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,870
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.

125
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,373
Well?

126
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,874
Then are we to understand, sir, we'll have...

127
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,514
...another maximum effort tomorrow?
- That's right.

128
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:42,817
Keep bringing me that weather as you get it.

129
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,654
Well, what headaches have you got, Earnie?

130
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:55,023
Have you been getting any sleep, Casey?

131
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,188
You're not pretty enough for a nurse.

132
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,924
What have you got?

133
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:04,071
Well, there's a rather stiff protest
here, sir, from a Robert Hintonbottom.

134
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,040
President of the Middle Counties Association
of Farmers, Dairymen and Poulters.

135
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,145
It seems these early take-offs
have been frightening the cows...

136
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,941
...around Colonel Foster's
base and drying up the milk.

137
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:16,243
He also says it's been
disturbing the chickens.

138
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,512
They're not laying like they used to.

139
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,587
Write him a polite letter, tell him
we're trying to lay a few eggs of our own.

140
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,225
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,126
- What is it, Evans?
- Message from General Kane, sir. Secret.

142
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:30,663
Read it.

143
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:35,301
"Members Military Affairs
Committee arrived in England.

144
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,770
Your command will be visited.
Imperative their impressions favorable.

145
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,705
Request your special efforts
to maintain low loss average...

146
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:45,677
...during critical three days
next. Signed, Malloway for Kane. "

147
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,943
All right. Wait a minute.

148
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:55,715
What else, Earnie?

149
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:59,486
There's this matter of Captain Donford
and Miss Blundy in the village, sir.

150
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,187
- What about it?
- She and her mother are pretty keen...

151
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,127
...that she should marry him.

152
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,393
What about the boy? Does he wanna marry her?

153
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:10,005
I don't know, sir, but he's got
one wife already in the States.

154
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,533
Is he combat crew or base personnel?

155
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,700
Navigator. Got 10 missions left to go.

156
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,209
Thanks. Do we know the woman?

157
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,607
oh, I know her, sir.

158
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,449
I beg your pardon, sir.

159
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,980
I'm not surprised. Any suggestion?

160
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:29,355
Excuse me, sir. Would the
general like to square...

161
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,358
...that is, have this matter
attended to by negotiations, sir?

162
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:33,893
If it can be done.

163
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,032
I'd have to have an order for a
couple of gallons of ice cream...

164
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,258
...and a few hours off, sir.

165
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,572
Get it and get going.

166
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,165
With the general's permission, sir.

167
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,867
These matters are better
attended to in the evening.

168
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,036
All right.

169
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,009
Anything else?

170
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:00,519
You and Cliff Garnet were
classmates, weren't you?

171
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:01,678
Yeah, why?

172
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:03,722
He's flying over here from Washington.

173
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:06,726
Due in at Prestwick this
afternoon. Did you know that?

174
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:10,660
Cliff Garnet.

175
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:15,270
I've known Cliff ever since we were racing
for a pair of corporal stripes at the Point.

176
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,235
I thought you'd always
been sort of neck and neck.

177
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:20,136
What's he doing over here?

178
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,971
They haven't announced an assignment for him.

179
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,976
Maybe you're gonna have a new boss, Earnie.

180
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,744
- A relay from Colonel Martin, sir.
- What's it say?

181
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,050
"Target plastered. Warm
up here. Signed, Ted. "

182
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,786
I'll bet it's pretty
warm in Schweinhafen too.

183
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:13,186
Get me London, Central 10,000.

184
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,421
<i>Elmer Brockhurst, United News.</i>

185
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:18,431
Yes, sir. Everything's under control, sir.

186
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,631
- What are you doing here, Mr. Brockhurst?
- Hello?

187
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,773
Your connections are terrible.

188
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:27,602
Hello, Maggie. Give me Bigelow.

189
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,573
Hello, Jack. Brockhurst.

190
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,148
I'm talking from a seat
right on the 50-yard line...

191
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,217
...but the game hasn't started yet.

192
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,720
Better get ready for the
same run around as yesterday.

193
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,882
Sure, I'll try.

194
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:44,719
okay, I'll call you.

195
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,554
Are you the new commanding general?

196
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,493
No, just a poor reporter
trying to do his job.

197
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,498
Poor reporter is right. I thought
Dennis told you to keep out.

198
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:53,999
He did.

199
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,865
You guys always get what you
want from Kane, don't you?

200
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,805
Public relations office is down the
hall. The general doesn't wanna see you.

201
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:03,911
I don't blame you for
feeling jumpy, sergeant.

202
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,278
Quite a deal, isn't it?

203
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:10,178
Your boss gets put in
top charge for one day...

204
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:13,412
...and loses more planes than
General Kane ever lost in a week.

205
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,080
Maybe he just doesn't like airplanes.

206
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:19,056
Maybe he doesn't like their crews either.

207
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,692
Tell me...

208
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,627
...why has Dennis got a flight
commander with 21 missions...

209
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,528
...confined to quarters at the 32nd?

210
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,169
Probably for not brushing his teeth.

211
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,971
Well, that disposes of
the item of Captain Jenks.

212
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,942
Does that finish your business?

213
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,976
I did want to say goodbye to
General Dennis before he left.

214
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:38,545
Goodbye? Who's leaving?

215
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,714
Well, trouble with the press...

216
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:45,252
...war hero under arrest, record
losses just one time too many...

217
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,912
I just have the feeling
he might be going home.

218
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,150
They never fired no general till
they give him the Legion of Merit.

219
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,817
They can pass it out mighty quick.

220
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,196
Gonna miss your hero?

221
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:58,299
No brass is a hero to me.

222
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,731
I've done my 25.

223
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,566
Captain Jenks to see General Dennis.

224
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,667
Captain Jenks reporting, sir.

225
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,607
<i>Have him come in.</i>

226
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,247
Yes, sir. okay, captain.

227
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:20,349
Want me with you, sir?

228
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:23,423
No, I'll talk to the captain
alone. Come in, Jenks.

229
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,120
Sit down.

230
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,430
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

231
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,002
I've got a pretty nasty report on you here.

232
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:40,198
I understand when the target was announced...

233
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,469
...you slammed out of the group's
briefing, said you wouldn't fly.

234
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,307
- What's your version of it?
- It's true, as far as it goes.

235
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,579
Captain Jenks, it's an old custom in
the service to call your superiors sir.

236
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,646
All right, we'll skip the
manners for the moment.

237
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,752
- Do you realize this is serious?
- I won't get killed to make you a record.

238
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:01,225
Maybe you've had too much.

239
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:03,864
I guess a few days down at
Bournemouth wouldn't hurt.

240
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:09,060
If you look in the bottom of the file, you'll
see I finished 10 days in a rest home, sir.

241
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,708
Tell me...

242
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:18,972
...your uncle's on the Military
Affairs Committee, isn't he?

243
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:21,480
Would that have anything
to do with your behavior?

244
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,981
Sure it has.

245
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:25,586
It's lucky I've got
somebody to look out for me.

246
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,484
How would you like to have
your squadron hear you say that?

247
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:31,285
- They feel the same way.
- They went this morning.

248
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,825
Don't give me that, general.

249
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:37,523
My squadron knows that I can take
it as well as anybody, if I want to.

250
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,530
I've been to plenty of tough targets.

251
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,899
Suppose I were to tell you...

252
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:48,600
...that the whole war might depend
on what we did yesterday and today?

253
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:51,507
That's what your PRo will tell us.

254
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:56,581
You and your crew were one of the
lead teams trained for this operation.

255
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,845
They needed you there today.

256
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:03,648
Do you know that we lost two ships from
your group this morning during assembly?

257
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,655
My crew, sir?

258
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,030
Get me Markington.

259
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,059
Hello, Markington? Colonel Walker.

260
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,933
Hello, Walker? General Dennis speaking.

261
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,841
Who did we lose in that
collision this morning?

262
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,000
Robinson, huh?

263
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,904
Yes, I think I did know him.

264
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,549
Yes, too bad. He was a good boy.

265
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:31,311
Who? Johnson?

266
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,684
oh, Johnston, huh?

267
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,722
No, I don't think I did.

268
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,360
Well, then neither one was a lead crew.

269
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,723
okay. Thanks, Walker.

270
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,991
Robinson, huh?

271
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,465
So you knew him?

272
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,729
Did you know whether
Frank was married or not?

273
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:52,499
Whether he had any kids
or where he came from?

274
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:55,939
You don't remember Johnston at all.
You don't know what he looked like.

275
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,578
- Take it easy.
- Why should you?

276
00:19:57,746 --> 00:20:01,113
He's only got in 20 missions over
Germany. only been here eight months.

277
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,741
You gave him his cluster on his DFC
after Bremfurt, shook his hand, said:

278
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,856
"The division is proud of you. Proud.
" Why do you try to remember our names?

279
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,356
- Why don't you call us by serial numbers?
- Captain!

280
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:12,550
Attention.

281
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,829
General Kane and party, sir.

282
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,557
- Hello, Casey.
- Sorry, I wish I'd known you were coming.

283
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,702
That's all right. We landed at
Prestwick a couple of hours ago.

284
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,461
I wanted to stop off and see you.

285
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,627
How was Washington?

286
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,036
About as you'd expect
with that meeting going on.

287
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,733
Is this man with your party?

288
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:31,812
Why, yes. I bumped into Brockie
right outside your office.

289
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,743
What were you doing, Mr. Brockhurst?

290
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,316
I know you and Brockie had
a little misunderstanding.

291
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,578
That was one thing I
wanted to straighten out.

292
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,222
- All right, that's all for now.
- Why, Captain Jenks.

293
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,258
Delighted to see you, my boy. I was talking
with your uncle in Washington on Monday.

294
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:48,089
He's looking forward to seeing
you when he gets over here.

295
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:51,061
Brockie, this is one of
our real combat leaders.

296
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,861
He's a flight commander
and already has 23 missions.

297
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,163
- It is 23, isn't it,
captain? - Twenty-one, sir.

298
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,430
oh, 21, eh?

299
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:00,473
Well, I guess that name on your
ship hardly applies anymore.

300
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:03,975
<i>Captain Jenks is the pilot of
our famous Impatient Virgin.</i>

301
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:07,343
Say now, there's a crew you could
do a wonderful picture layout on.

302
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,416
- It's already been done, general.
- Good.

303
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,052
You care to see what I've
written about your squadron?

304
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,619
Thanks.

305
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,949
You better bring it up to date.

306
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,025
McPhearson, here, was killed on Friday.

307
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,321
Jacobs went down yesterday.

308
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:23,224
All right, captain.

309
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:32,773
What have you been doing? I got
the shock of my life last night.

310
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,135
I was afraid of that.

311
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,142
When we sat down at Gander,
Prescott handed me a message...

312
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,645
...from Washington saying
you'd lost 48 ships yesterday.

313
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:41,976
That's right, 48.

314
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,779
I'd just finished selling the chiefs on
the low cost of daylight bombardment...

315
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:49,412
...and you spring these appalling losses
on me. Casey, surely you must re...

316
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,189
That's Cliff Garnet. He flew over with me.

317
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,663
Apparently, the chief wants
him to look under a few beds.

318
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:04,231
I'm sorry, Casey. Who should I run
into out there but old Ramrod Haley.

319
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,603
I just told him about the pilot,
the mermaid and the rubber dinghy.

320
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,505
- How are you?
- Glad to see you, Cliff.

321
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:12,476
I saw Kathy and those youngsters
of yours day before I left.

322
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:15,115
- Yeah? How are they?
- Fine, Casey, fine.

323
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:17,376
Got some letters and packages for you.

324
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,417
- How's Ted?
- Keeping busy.

325
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,988
That's good. Sis gave me
a lot of messages for him.

326
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,625
- How is Helen?
- She's fine. She's staying with mother.

327
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,385
She's expecting it any day now.

328
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,461
Have you braced yourself to be an uncle?

329
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,793
I'm hoping it will be a girl. one
who won't fly anything but a kite.

330
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:35,232
No, not Ted's daughter. She'll
probably be another Amelia Earhart.

331
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:37,395
- General, what are you doing here?
- Brockie.

332
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,564
I thought you were sitting
with the mighty in the Pentagon.

333
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:44,735
I gotta get out once in a while and see
how these boys are fighting the real war.

334
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:47,643
You're doing a wonderful job,
Casey. All you fellas are.

335
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:49,784
Have they turned you into an air inspector?

336
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:51,676
Well, no.

337
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:54,651
The chief can't wait to find
out everything through channels.

338
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:57,314
Call it personal reconnaissance.

339
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,059
General Dennis. Who?

340
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,753
Just a minute, he's right here.

341
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,957
- It's for you, sir, the Duchess of Waverly.
- oh, thank you.

342
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:08,329
Hello. Hello, Millie.

343
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,993
Yes, I just arrived.

344
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,367
I tried to get in touch
with you from Prestwick.

345
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:17,569
oh, I wanted to tell you again how
charming the luncheon was last week.

346
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:20,676
The results were very evident in Washington.

347
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:25,611
oh, no, it was very useful to meet
him for once in an informal way.

348
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,321
Your luncheons may have done
more for daylight bombardment...

349
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,392
...than all the tonnage
we've dropped since April.

350
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,256
Thank you, my dear.

351
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:39,056
Thursday? Yes, yes, I think I can.

352
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,792
Some what?

353
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:43,566
oh, peanuts.

354
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,702
Certainly. Send them over with
my sergeant this afternoon.

355
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:50,504
All right, Millie. Goodbye.

356
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:54,947
Come on now, Brockie, don't look so gloomy.

357
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:58,245
I want you and Casey to cut this
out. We're fighting the same war.

358
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,413
I tried to explain to him that nobody wants
to withhold information from the press.

359
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:05,560
I've seen the way Mr. Brockhurst
handles legitimate information.

360
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,422
- When?
- After Bremfurt.

361
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,292
We needed another attack to finish that job.

362
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:14,492
By the time you got through with our losses,
and Washington got through explaining...

363
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:19,129
...we got an order that it'd be politically
impossible to attack the place again.

364
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:22,765
Boys are being killed today with cannon
made at Bremfurt since that attack.

365
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:24,912
- Now wait a minute...
- You think, general...

366
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,141
...that the American public should accept
losses without even knowing the target?

367
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:32,083
Yesterday's communiqué
was pretty skimpy, Casey.

368
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:33,915
But we've certainly nothing to hide.

369
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,683
our loss average is still
far below expectations.

370
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:38,951
- Is today going to help it?
- What do you mean?

371
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,595
Yesterday was a bloody
massacre. Won't today be worse?

372
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:44,926
- I don't like your language, Mr. Brockhurst.
- I'm sorry, general...

373
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,729
...but even a dumb civilian can tell
you've got a maximum effort out today.

374
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,394
Maximum?

375
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,568
Where did they go today?

376
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,070
This is not a matter for the press.

377
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,407
Brockie's been a friend
of air power for years.

378
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,447
What's today's target?

379
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,777
very good, sir. Schweinhafen.

380
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:09,048
Schweinhafen. And yesterday?

381
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:11,089
Yesterday's target was Posenleben, sir.

382
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,591
Casey, you haven't started...

383
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:22,502
Brockie, I'm afraid there is a question of
security involved here, if you don't mind.

384
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:33,445
- Have you started operation Stitch?
- The second phase is on today, sir.

385
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,144
I don't want the congressional
committee to come today.

386
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:42,347
Call London and have their itinerary changed.

387
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:45,357
See that they don't get here
before the day after tomorrow.

388
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,519
- And cancel that thing at the embassy.
- Yes, sir.

389
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,992
Get me command headquarters.
This is General Kane.

390
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,068
Get me General Malloway.

391
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:57,799
Hello, Bob? oh, pretty good.

392
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,565
Let's scramble.

393
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:01,302
Ready?

394
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,137
No, I'm at Dennis' headquarters.

395
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,542
I want a complete security
blackout on today's operations.

396
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:09,616
Nothing to be passed on to London
without my personal approval.

397
00:26:09,784 --> 00:26:12,446
Under no circumstances will
any field order be sent out...

398
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,885
...unless you hear from me personally.

399
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:18,423
That's right. I'm resuming command as of now.

400
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,060
All right, Bob.

401
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,057
Casey, this may pull
down the work of 20 years.

402
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,133
All right, let's have it.

403
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,465
After you left, weather
conference gave us a clear break...

404
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:33,039
...over central and northeast
Germany for four days.

405
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,732
There was a chance to do the job.

406
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:37,673
Possibly the last one, so I laid on Stitch.

407
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,179
Regardless that you might be
upsetting the larger picture.

408
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,642
Larger than what, sir?
The outcome of the war?

409
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:48,619
The outcome will depend on how large an
air force the combined chiefs allocate us.

410
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,758
- Isn't that correct?
- It is, sir. You see...

411
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,449
You took advantage of my absence.

412
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:55,460
You know it wasn't my intention
to implement Stitch this soon.

413
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,598
It was my decision to make, sir. I made it.

414
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,666
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

415
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:03,998
May an ignorant visitor inquire just
what operation Stitch is all about?

416
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:07,738
You must know something about this
new German fighter, Lantze-Wolf 1.

417
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:10,537
You mean that miracle jet
job they're supposed to have?

418
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,442
- Is that it?
- That's it.

419
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,841
- I want to run that special film for Garnet.
- oh, yes, sir.

420
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,250
Six weeks ago, a German
plane like that model...

421
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,824
...landed on the number
one strip at Ted's field.

422
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:27,018
- Shot up?
- Not a scratch.

423
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:30,995
The pilot was a Czechoslovakian engineer.
He'd been forced to work for the Nazis.

424
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:34,863
When they sent him to the Baltic to
test this job, he flew it here instead.

425
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,367
Sweet of him.

426
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,829
Here are the tests.

427
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:45,641
our Lightning, Thunderbolt, Mustang, Spit 12.

428
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,442
And this is the Lantze-Wolf 1.

429
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:52,052
Speed, altitude, almost
double of anything we've got.

430
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:53,786
It's a terrific improvement.

431
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,753
Improvement? It's a revolution, Cliff.

432
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,722
- You ready, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

433
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,986
Gentlemen, sit down.

434
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:29,251
If Göring can put enough
of these into the air...

435
00:28:29,424 --> 00:28:32,086
...he can knock us out in 60 days.
- That's an assumption.

436
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,955
I'm sorry, sir, but it's a cold fact.

437
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,587
These Lantzes will turn every type
of plane we have into a sitting duck.

438
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,695
I don't have to tell you once they get
control of the air over the continent...

439
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,304
...a ground invasion will be a pipe dream.

440
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,706
It was fighters that kept them out of
Britain. Fighters and their own indecision.

441
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,284
We thought these were
just drawing-board figures.

442
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:10,462
Casey, where are they making these kites?

443
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:22,266
We know now that there are three factories
in Germany actually producing these planes.

444
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:25,277
That is, there were until yesterday anyway.

445
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,974
Posenleben, Schweinhafen, Fendelhorst.

446
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:31,942
There it is, Cliff, operation Stitch...

447
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,213
...for "stitch in time. "

448
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:40,290
General Kane, why hasn't more of
this been reported to Washington?

449
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:42,657
I couldn't endorse such alarming conclusions.

450
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,958
Not at the very time
when everything depends...

451
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,829
...on our getting established
on an acceptable loss basis.

452
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:50,994
Casey, why didn't you wait at
least until the meeting was over?

453
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,572
We would have lost our
weather, which is everything.

454
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,606
To you and me, maybe, but not to topside.

455
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:58,302
A third day like this might
kill precision bombardment.

456
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,846
I'm not at all sure I'm
justified in permitting it.

457
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:03,006
Sir, if we don't finish the job now...

458
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:06,915
...the men and the planes we've lost
so far will have been lost for nothing.

459
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,120
Here they come.

460
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:56,097
Six, eight, nine. How many did
the 329th put up this morning?

461
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,761
Thirty-six, I think it was, sir.

462
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,031
Nine...

463
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,538
...ten...

464
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,232
...eleven.

465
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,205
- I make it eleven.
- So do I.

466
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,575
How many do you have in a squadron?

467
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:10,149
Twelve, if it was a squadron.

468
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:14,383
That isn't the remains
of a group is it, Casey?

469
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:18,083
- I can't tell yet.
- Well, find out. Find out at once.

470
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,609
Boy, this really is a mess.

471
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:40,037
Better be a story on this, general...

472
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:44,082
...or it'll look like a cover-up for
the worst blunder since Pearl Harbor.

473
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,251
That was a whole group, sir.

474
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:58,297
Eleven out of 36. That's almost 70 percent.

475
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,831
Colonel Martin just called in.

476
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,026
Eight miles southeast of the base.

477
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,637
He sent three ships ahead
for emergency landings.

478
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:08,298
- Are they going to land here?
- Yes, sir. That's two of them now.

479
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:11,637
Where's the third one?

480
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:13,075
Still sweating it out.

481
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,475
A bombardier is supposed
to be flying that one.

482
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,585
- A bombardier?
- Yes, sir. Pilot and copilot both hurt.

483
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,551
He's probably a washed-out flying cadet.

484
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,850
That first one's got his
number four feathered.

485
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,151
<i>Hello, Nut Tree.</i>

486
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,419
<i>This is Kumquat B-
Baker, Kumquat B-Baker.</i>

487
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:31,156
<i>Two miles southeast of field.
Landing instructions, please.</i>

488
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:36,861
Kumquat B-Baker, land runway
two-four. Wind variable, 10 miles.

489
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,130
Have you wounded aboard?

490
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:40,137
<i>Nut Tree, this is Kumquat B-Baker.</i>

491
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,708
<i>Two wounded aboard. Have ambulance stand by.</i>

492
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,674
Roger, Kumquat B-Baker.

493
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:53,313
<i>Hello, Nut Tree, this is Jellybean
M- Mike following Kumquat B-Baker in.</i>

494
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:56,719
<i>Have ambulance stand by. Wounded aboard.</i>

495
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,382
Roger, Jellybean M-Mike.

496
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,648
<i>Hello, Nut Tree, this is Lazy
Dog L-Love coming over field.</i>

497
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,916
<i>Bombardier Lieutenant Nelson flying.
Pilot wounded and copilot dead.</i>

498
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,854
<i>What'll I do? Over.</i>

499
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:35,726
Hello, Nelson. Nut Tree to
Nelson, how much gas have you got?

500
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:41,560
<i>I think she's about empty. Gas
gauge reads dry. What'll I do?</i>

501
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:44,034
Roger. Stand by.

502
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:58,344
- He's putting his wheels down.
- Don't let that boy try to land...

503
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,783
...with the whole group coming in.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,349
Hello, Nelson. Get 1000 feet.

505
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:07,790
Have crew bail out and head for Wash.

506
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,754
When headed toward water, bail out yourself.

507
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,924
<i>Having rest of crew bail out.</i>

508
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:24,507
<i>Landing instructions, please.</i>

509
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,806
Nelson, you are not to land.

510
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,381
Repeat. You are not to land.

511
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,485
Continue to Wash as advised.

512
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:36,052
<i>Sorry, Nut Tree, I can't bail out.</i>

513
00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:40,627
<i>My pilot is alive but cannot be
moved. He cannot use his hands.</i>

514
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:44,356
<i>- Give me landing instructions, please.
- Let me talk to him.</i>

515
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,525
Hello, Nelson.

516
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,171
Are you receiving me?

517
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,068
<i>I am receiving you.</i>

518
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:56,039
Have you ever landed a 17 before?

519
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,075
<i>Not quite.</i>

520
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,305
<i>- Not alone.
- Hello, Nut Tree.</i>

521
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,005
<i>This is Bluebird Red Leader.</i>

522
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:06,381
<i>Red Leader calling Nut Tree.
Turning on final. Go ahead.</i>

523
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:07,782
That's Ted Martin.

524
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,619
Roger, Red Leader. Use runway two-four.

525
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:16,889
Wind, 10, variable.

526
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:20,864
Watch out for B-17 making
emergency landing on one-seven.

527
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,900
<i>Roger, Nut Tree.</i>

528
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,561
Will he send the group around
until this boy gets out?

529
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,676
- He can't. They haven't any gas left either.
- Hello, Nelson. Hello, Nelson.

530
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,675
Now, listen carefully. You
may land on runway one-seven.

531
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:41,913
Do not use runway two-four.

532
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:43,484
<i>Roger.</i>

533
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:47,116
There'll be a little crosswind.
Do you think you can make it?

534
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:48,484
<i>I'll try.</i>

535
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,630
You'll make it.

536
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,324
Now, start letting down a little.

537
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:58,969
That's it.

538
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,338
Keep your air speed at 140
until you know you can make it.

539
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,841
Can you see the runway all right?

540
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:08,442
<i>I see it.</i>

541
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,716
Start your turn over that farmhouse,
so that you'll have a long approach.

542
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,952
That's it. Easy.

543
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:23,494
Not too steep. Not too steep, boy.

544
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:29,466
That looks good.

545
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:33,762
When you're over the end of the runway,
don't forget to cut your switches.

546
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,572
Do you know where they are?

547
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:37,904
<i>- I think so, sir.
- Don't talk now.</i>

548
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,547
That red bar just in front of your throttles.

549
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:42,482
See it?

550
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:46,884
You seem to be lined up all right.

551
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:50,649
Now, reduce your air speed to 120.

552
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,453
Bring the stick back a little.

553
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:55,895
Not too much.

554
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:57,223
That's it.

555
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:02,464
Point it at the end of the runway.
I'll tell you when to level out.

556
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:04,762
Now, put your flaps down.

557
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:08,268
No, no, not your landing gear.

558
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:11,206
The switch right next to it, the flaps.

559
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,973
<i>- Flaps coming down...
- Don't bother answering me now.</i>

560
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,581
Keep your eyes on the runway.

561
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,086
You're doing fine.

562
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,624
Let her down.

563
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,852
Easy.

564
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:32,289
okay. Now, start back on the stick.

565
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,334
Keep her straight.

566
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,682
Good boy.

567
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:56,288
Keep that stick full back.

568
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:57,685
Stay off the brakes.

569
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:01,617
Stay off those breaks!

570
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,086
That's Ted's ship there now.

571
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:44,199
- That Nelson a new boy?
- No, sir.

572
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,398
He's one of our original
squadron bombardiers.

573
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:09,158
- Glad to see you back, Colonel Martin.
- Glad to be back.

574
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,730
- Where's the old man?
- He's sweating you out inside.

575
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:13,833
He's got a crowd of big wheels with him.

576
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:17,528
- What big wheels?
- General Kane and General Garnet, sir.

577
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,235
Never mind. I'll get rid of them for you.

578
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:36,254
All right, that way. The
second interrogation table.

579
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:40,019
The crew's all set up and waiting.
Photographers are ready when you are, sir.

580
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:42,287
- Photographers?
- What photographers, sergeant?

581
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,058
- Division and group public relations.
- By whose authority? Who ordered them?

582
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,929
Generals always have their
pictures taken wherever they go.

583
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:50,434
It helps the boys' morale.

584
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:52,765
Well, well, if it helps morale...

585
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,204
Cliff, sit in on one of these interrogations.

586
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:58,641
Come on, Brockie. We'll be in
here, Casey, when Ted comes.

587
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,246
Whose idea was that?

588
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:04,009
Sir, we never would have gotten
rid of them without photographers.

589
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:08,349
Someday you're gonna wisecrack yourself
right into the infantry, sergeant.

590
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,755
What are you looking so grim about?

591
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,395
Ted.

592
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:18,559
- What's been keeping you? You all right?
- Not a scratch.

593
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,427
What's that blood?

594
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,091
My radioman.

595
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:23,736
- Bad?
- Dead.

596
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:26,338
- Anybody else?
- Not in our plane.

597
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,704
- As soon as you find that, bring it over.
- Yes, sir.

598
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:31,845
Hello, Goldberg. When are you gonna retire?

599
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,503
I guess I should have retired yesterday.

600
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,910
Let's get a drink.

601
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,744
Evans, bring a couple of rations.

602
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,249
- We'll be in there.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,684
Make it three. Tell them
you're taking Hamilton's.

604
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,881
He doesn't drink. I bought his on the way in.

605
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:46,583
- I'm glad you got back today.
- So am I.

606
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,798
Sorry, sir, I brought four by mistake.

607
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:55,192
- Glad to see you back, Colonel Martin.
- Thanks.

608
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:07,511
I hear Kane and that dashing
brother-in-law of mine are here.

609
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,910
Yeah. The place is full of generals today.

610
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,244
Did Cliff bring any news from Helen?

611
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:17,618
Well, you're not a father yet.
Cliff says she looks wonderful.

612
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:20,783
- I've been keeping an eye out for a cable.
- Thanks.

613
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:25,726
What's Cliff doing so far from home?

614
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,697
Well, he intimated...

615
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:31,360
...just routine rubbernecking,
high-level courier stuff.

616
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,302
Intimated?

617
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,506
Well, the handle doesn't stick out anyway.

618
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:40,078
Colonel, you're speaking
of your revered relative...

619
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,511
...and a general officer
in the U.S. Air Force.

620
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:46,175
Any brigadier in the Air Force would
give his next star for your job, Casey.

621
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:49,720
Well, as soon as we finish Stitch,
they can have it for corporal stripes.

622
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,859
Thank heavens we're two-thirds finished.

623
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,796
What's wrong?

624
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:58,829
That's the joker, Casey.

625
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,467
We aren't two-thirds finished.

626
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:02,995
We aren't what?

627
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,695
You did Posenleben yesterday
and Schweinhafen today.

628
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,501
We didn't touch Schweinhafen today.

629
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,775
What?

630
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:13,410
You signaled me.

631
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,143
Mistake.

632
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:21,352
We plastered some darn place that looked
like it, some 20 miles from Schweinhafen.

633
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,560
- How'd it happen?
- Sighting mistake.

634
00:42:38,205 --> 00:42:40,298
It was my fault, Casey.

635
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,875
Just as we started the bomb run, the
second group turned inside at the IP.

636
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,137
We had to swing wide to get out of their way.

637
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,804
Goldberg had only a
minute for identification.

638
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,544
There sat a town that looked more like
Schweinhafen than Schweinhafen does.

639
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,982
Checkpoints were identical.

640
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,782
We were both fooled by
that dummy camouflage...

641
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:59,255
...and threw our whole load down the chimney.

642
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:01,826
The others salvoed into our smoke.

643
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:10,266
How do you know it wasn't Schweinhafen?

644
00:43:10,437 --> 00:43:13,600
After we turned north, on our
way back, we saw the real target.

645
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:16,766
There was Schweinhafen without a scratch.

646
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,813
Generals Kane and Garnet had to go
to the phone. A call from Washington.

647
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:25,076
They'll meet you and
Colonel Martin at dinner.

648
00:43:25,252 --> 00:43:26,617
Thank you.

649
00:43:37,564 --> 00:43:40,692
I guess Evans should have
snitched another one of these.

650
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:45,805
okay, Goldberg.

651
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,373
Keep checking if you have
to pull out every picture.

652
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,601
I'll be at the general's quarters.

653
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:54,473
He's still looking through
the target photos. No luck yet.

654
00:43:54,682 --> 00:43:57,879
I'd like to know what we did
hit before Kane gets here.

655
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,348
Casey, you look tired.

656
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:03,888
If you don't take care of yourself,
someone else will be doing this work.

657
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,855
Maybe today'll give us both a rest.

658
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:07,823
What's it gonna do to Stitch?

659
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:09,189
Set us back one day.

660
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:12,322
We'll hit Schweinhafen
tomorrow and Fendelhorst Monday.

661
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:14,091
- The weather will hold.
- Will Kane?

662
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,668
- He'll have to.
- He had cold feet before we started.

663
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:20,136
Tell him about today's snafu
and he'll kill Stitch for good.

664
00:44:20,774 --> 00:44:21,763
What do you suggest?

665
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:23,967
Don't let him know, tonight anyway.

666
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:28,046
I'll guarantee you Kane won't be able
to tell today's photos from Schweinhafen.

667
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:30,617
When are you going to learn about the Army?

668
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,911
We're not stunt flyers at the state fair.

669
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:35,011
oh, good evening.

670
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:37,248
We can be grateful for one thing at least.

671
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:41,155
From what the boys tell me, this seems
to be the finest job of bombing ever done.

672
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:43,421
What a price though, 52 ships.

673
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,121
- Ted, how are you?
- Still kicking.

674
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:46,596
- Glad to see you.
- Thank you.

675
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,995
Sorry you had a rough day.

676
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:50,932
But when you're leading, we
never worry about the target.

677
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:55,041
Soon as they're through, you'll be glad to
know the family's still interested in you.

678
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:57,473
- How is she?
- Sir, I'd like to speak to you alone.

679
00:44:57,644 --> 00:45:00,306
As soon as Cliff tells you
about our talk with Washington.

680
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,278
- Dinner is served, sir.
- Come on, Cliff.

681
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,438
Where's Brockie?

682
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,744
Stayed over to finish
his Schweinhafen stories.

683
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,753
I made him realize this wasn't the fiasco
he thought. He seemed rather impressed.

684
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:11,788
I think he'll give us a very good story.

685
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,018
It's important that I have a minute with you.

686
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,630
Wait, Casey, I want Cliff
to... Cliff, tell him, will you?

687
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:19,993
Well, Casey...

688
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:22,098
...you may think I ratted on you...

689
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:25,033
...but I felt that our people
ought to know what's going on.

690
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:28,140
While on the phone with Washington,
I persuaded General Kane...

691
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,903
...to let me talk to the Air Board.
- What did they say?

692
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,139
Unfortunately, most of them are
in Florida at the proving grounds.

693
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,044
Testing a new typewriter?

694
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:39,947
Casey, I can't tolerate this attitude.

695
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,953
our public relations policies
got us where we are today.

696
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:44,112
It sure has.

697
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,920
The chief wasn't there, but I had a very
constructive talk with Lester Blender.

698
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:49,790
And what did Lester "Yes, sir" say?

699
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:53,228
He was shocked at your losses, but
since you are two-thirds done...

700
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,301
...I think I sold him on letting
you finish operation Stitch...

701
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,961
...after the Washington meetings are over.

702
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:02,472
Sir, did you let that little
two-stars stooge forbid us...?

703
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:05,578
Casey, if you'll play ball now,
all will be fine after Tuesday.

704
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:06,940
Including the weather?

705
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:09,541
I found where it was, sir.

706
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,548
Excuse me, sir.

707
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:18,384
- You said when I found them...
- That's right. Come in, Goldberg.

708
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,427
General Kane, today's lead
bombardier, Lieutenant Goldberg.

709
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:25,360
Lieutenant, the chief will be
proud of your mission today.

710
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,658
Thank you, sir.

711
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:29,997
- oh, colonel, here are the photos.
- Thanks, Gold...

712
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:38,172
Let's get these under a stronger light, huh?

713
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:52,982
Wonderful.

714
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,991
That's what I call precision bombing.

715
00:46:55,162 --> 00:46:56,186
Look, Cliff, look.

716
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:59,924
Here's the highway coming in here,
here's the river, and here's the factory.

717
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,625
You've got them upside down, sir.

718
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,305
Sir, if you and I can excuse
ourselves for a minute...

719
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:10,136
Be right with you, Casey. Look
at that destruction, Cliff.

720
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,335
These will go to Washington by special plane.

721
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:14,913
Sir, I'd like to frame these
on a good white board...

722
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,676
...with a title, "The Doom of Schweinhafen. "

723
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,513
It isn't Schweinhafen, sir.

724
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,618
That's right, sir.

725
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,759
That's what I was trying to tell you.

726
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,360
It isn't Schweinhafen.

727
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,023
Not Schweinhafen? What is it then?

728
00:47:31,198 --> 00:47:34,326
It's the Nautilus torpedo
factory at Gritzenheim, sir.

729
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:36,059
Torpedo factory?

730
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:38,033
General, this is very opportune.

731
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:39,900
Half the united chiefs are admirals.

732
00:47:40,073 --> 00:47:42,200
If we can get these to
the allocation meeting...

733
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:43,536
I'll send my own plane.

734
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,541
You don't know what you've done for us.

735
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:48,545
Showing them that in the midst
of the greatest air campaign...

736
00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:52,173
...we still think enough of the larger
aspect to knock out a torpedo factory too.

737
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:54,616
I'm sorry, sir. It wasn't "too. "

738
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,813
It was "instead. "

739
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:04,294
Instead?

740
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,932
You let me tell Washington
you destroyed Schweinhafen.

741
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,330
- Brockie's writing a story.
- It was a mistake.

742
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:10,800
We hit this Nautilus place.

743
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,235
- Whose mistake?
- Mine, sir. The briefing.

744
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,632
The briefing was perfect. I lead
the division, I loused it up.

745
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,710
These gentlemen are covering for me, sir.

746
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:21,279
I was well-briefed, and
I was on the bombsight.

747
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:24,042
- I got mixed up in the fighting.
- Why'd you get mixed up?

748
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:26,344
- Were you scared?
- Yes, sir, I'm always scared.

749
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,216
What do you mean entrusting
a mission of this importance...

750
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:31,789
...to a man who admits...?
- I should like to explain.

751
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:33,984
Sir, General Kane doesn't understand.

752
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,289
Do you understand what
I'd be justified in doing?

753
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:41,628
You ought to shoot me for
wasting 520 boys this afternoon.

754
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:44,600
I'd be grateful if you did.

755
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,643
Sir, Lieutenant Goldberg
is on the fourth mission...

756
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:58,182
...of a voluntary second tour
of duty over German targets only.

757
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,252
He isn't my group bombardier by accident.

758
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,945
He knows there's a German
order waiting for him.

759
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:05,353
He knew it when he
volunteered for a second tour.

760
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,722
Today, he hit what we both
thought was the target perfectly.

761
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:12,194
I've just written him up for
a cluster on his Silver Star.

762
00:49:16,937 --> 00:49:19,371
Send the citation to me personally.

763
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,234
Thank you, sir.

764
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:28,242
General Dennis.

765
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:30,707
Wait a minute.

766
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:33,818
My group commanders are standing
by for tomorrow's orders, sir.

767
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:36,353
I should like to give them their target.

768
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:39,892
Casey...

769
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:42,424
...yesterday, we lost 48.

770
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:44,154
Today, 52.

771
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:47,664
You must be crazy to think I'm going
to rush into a third day like this.

772
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:50,632
We've got to think this thing
over from every possible angle.

773
00:49:50,804 --> 00:49:52,704
Tell them to wait.

774
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,574
You'll have to wait a bit longer.

775
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:02,811
I know it is, but there's nothing we can do.

776
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:05,349
Tell all groups to stand by.

777
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,457
No.

778
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:24,234
No target yet, huh?

779
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:27,464
They're probably only on
their first brandy over there.

780
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:31,008
Well, brandy or no brandy...

781
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:32,778
General Dennis' quarters.

782
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:41,210
General Dennis. Hold on a minute, George.

783
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:44,055
General, they're still
sweating out tomorrow's order.

784
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:45,521
Tell them you'll call back.

785
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:48,718
May I at least order an alert for
a possible maximum effort, sir?

786
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:52,387
If you're willing to put the strain
on your people, probably for nothing.

787
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,361
Tell all groups to be ready
for a maximum effort tomorrow.

788
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:57,765
Cut the tape for phase two, operation Stitch.

789
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:01,203
That's right. Phase two, Schweinhafen.

790
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:05,637
And hold it. Don't send it out
until you get further orders.

791
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,472
Why does everything have to happen at once?

792
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:13,745
We go to Schweinhafen where we had no
business going, and then we don't hit it.

793
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,445
We wait for good weather all
year, and we get it now...

794
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:18,955
...just when this committee's on top of us.

795
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:22,823
If my own wife were to walk in
here now, I wouldn't be surprised.

796
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,123
- What is it now?
- Mr. Brockhurst is outside.

797
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:26,526
No, not now. We're up to...

798
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,498
- May I come in?
- You are in, Mr. Brockhurst.

799
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,433
We're rather occupied for the
moment. What can I do for you?

800
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:33,834
Straighten me out a little.

801
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,742
I was pretty interested in what you
told me about that Schweinhafen place.

802
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:40,607
But now the boys over at
the 32nd have me confused.

803
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:43,545
- It seems they...
- There's been a mistake. We just found out.

804
00:51:43,717 --> 00:51:47,483
Yes, I know. The Nautilus
torpedo factory at Gritzenheim.

805
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:49,178
But Homer tells me it's okay.

806
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:51,786
That this Gritzenheim
plant is just as important.

807
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:54,552
Naturally, some targets are
more important than others...

808
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:59,188
...but a blow like this against Germany's
submarine campaign can affect the war.

809
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,961
Any more than an attack with fighter
cover on the sub pens across the Channel?

810
00:52:03,136 --> 00:52:04,467
Now, don't misunderstand me...

811
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:07,971
In view of the fact that we didn't
hit our planned target today...

812
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:11,474
...the Gritzenheim torpedo factory
was considerably better than nothing.

813
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:13,078
Does that answer your question?

814
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:15,544
- You can do us a tremendous service.
- What is it?

815
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,706
- Sit down and write this story.
- What story?

816
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,580
From the standpoint of
interservice cooperation alone...

817
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:23,154
...the importance of naval
targets is beyond dispute.

818
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:24,847
- Take Gritzenheim...
- May I, sir?

819
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:27,858
- Yes, go ahead, Homer.
- How about this caption, Brockie?

820
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:30,326
"The eagle's answer to
the U-boat wolf packs.

821
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:33,227
Doom of an Axis torpedo factory. "

822
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,100
Well, that's the rough idea anyway.

823
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,865
And then with two more days on naval
targets, we can average down losses.

824
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:43,805
Put the Navy under obligation
to us, right at the meetings.

825
00:52:43,977 --> 00:52:46,878
- Right.
- And that washes up operation Stitch.

826
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:49,415
operation what?

827
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,342
oh, that's a special project, Mr. Brockhurst.

828
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,410
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

829
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,150
I'm afraid I knew beforehand you
were gonna give me the runaround.

830
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:02,693
I may as well tell you now, I'll write
this story straight or not at all.

831
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,426
The loss of a thousand boys is
still quite a news item back home.

832
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:09,931
Wait, Brockie.

833
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:13,704
You know I've always trusted
you. I'm going to trust you now.

834
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:15,774
Remember what I told you off the record...

835
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,843
...about the possibility of enemy
secret weapons in the future?

836
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:21,606
Casey, let me have that memorandum on Stitch.

837
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,220
Here. Go in there and read this,
then forget what you've read.

838
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:38,630
- Major Lansing's outside, sir.
- Who?

839
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,925
My intelligence officer.
You wanted to see him.

840
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:43,934
- You say this fella's pretty good.
- He's honest and has sense.

841
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:45,696
- What is he, a synthetic?
- Retread.

842
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:48,272
Artilleryman in the last
war, insurance broker since.

843
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:49,806
Probably a good husband too.

844
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,069
- Have him come in.
- Yes, sir.

845
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,180
Shall I put the chicken back in the oven?

846
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:58,909
oh, let's not bother about that now.
We'll be out of here in a few minutes.

847
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:01,144
That's fine, sir.

848
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,891
- Do you want me, sir?
- Come in, Lansing.

849
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:09,552
General Kane, my A2, Major Lansing.

850
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:10,821
Good evening, sir.

851
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,763
Major, do you think the Germans will be
able to put on as tough a show tomorrow...

852
00:54:14,935 --> 00:54:17,495
...as they did today?
- They will if we go into Germany.

853
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,333
But how can they? We've claimed
over 180 enemy fighters...

854
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,270
...in the last two days.
- We've claimed that.

855
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:23,966
- You don't believe them?
- No, sir.

856
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:27,272
- Then why do you report them?
- orders from your headquarters, sir.

857
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,539
Well, you understand that's
necessary for the boys' morale.

858
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:34,516
Do you think the German command
knows what Stitch is about?

859
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,350
- It's my personal opinion that they don't, sir.
- Why?

860
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,118
The Germans don't like to
give their superiors bad news.

861
00:54:40,293 --> 00:54:41,885
How can they help reporting that?

862
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:44,257
Their information goes
up through channels too.

863
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,825
- Is that a sarcasm, major?
- It's a fact, sir.

864
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,333
The German radio just announced they
destroyed 160 of our bombers today.

865
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:52,300
Doubtless for the German boys' morale.

866
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:55,669
You evidently don't think their
high command likes to face the truth.

867
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,777
Well, my observation is most
professional soldiers think more...

868
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:01,277
...about their political
problems than the enemy.

869
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,446
So when war comes, they ask amateurs
like me what to do with their weapons.

870
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:07,950
When the results are bad,
they fire the amateurs...

871
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:10,112
...and make the commanders field marshals.

872
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,191
- We don't have field marshals.
- I'm speaking about the Germans.

873
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,420
What will their reaction be if we
go back to Schweinhafen tomorrow?

874
00:55:16,596 --> 00:55:18,257
They'll have to face the truth, sir.

875
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:21,457
And concentrate every fighter they
have in defense of Fendelhorst?

876
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,625
We'd have to expect that, sir.

877
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:25,737
That's what I think, major.

878
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,305
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Yes, sir.

879
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:29,806
Facing the facts ourselves...

880
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:32,604
...do you think it's sound
to continue Stitch right now?

881
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:36,237
If you wish to continue
precision bombardment, sir.

882
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:39,651
You mean you think it's feasible?

883
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:42,049
I think it's imperative.

884
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,219
Thank you, major.

885
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:57,260
Mighty independent major you keep, Casey.

886
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,031
of course, he's really only a civilian.

887
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:01,999
"Precision bombardment imperative. "

888
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:05,736
The man's not even checked out on a
Piper Cub, he tells me what's imperative.

889
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:07,880
- He's right, sir.
- I've spent 20 years...

890
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:09,948
...working for bombardment. The chief, 25.

891
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,947
- You kids don't know how we fought.
- No?

892
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,916
No. You're giving your youth.
We've already given ours.

893
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:18,717
I was 12 years a captain. The chief, 14.

894
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:21,520
We took Billy Mitchell's
side when it meant Siberia...

895
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:23,719
...and they sent us to a cavalry school.

896
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:26,263
I was the second-best pilot in America...

897
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:29,368
...and they assigned me to
keeping records of manure disposal.

898
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:32,061
But we never gave up, we never quit trying.

899
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,035
We wrote anything we could get printed.

900
00:56:34,207 --> 00:56:36,675
We went down on our knees
to Hollywood for pictures...

901
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:40,939
...and we risked our necks every day
to get publicity to educate the public.

902
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:43,548
And we kept our own funds for the widows.

903
00:56:43,716 --> 00:56:45,741
We tested without parachutes.

904
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:49,548
We flew the mail through solid
glue in obsolete training ships.

905
00:56:49,722 --> 00:56:52,657
And the year Hermann Göring
dominated the Munich Conference...

906
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:57,763
...our appropriation still wasn't as big
as the New York City public-safety budget.

907
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,059
- Why didn't you tell the story?
- You don't tell stories in uniform.

908
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:02,861
We were promised 50,000 planes...

909
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:05,869
...and our boys were never gonna
fight again in a foreign war.

910
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:08,030
So the country went back to sleep...

911
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:12,406
...and we were called from the stables to
make a modern air force out of promises.

912
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:13,910
They told us the experience...

913
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,742
There was no experience in
daylight precision bombardment.

914
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:20,113
Both the Germans and British tried
it and said it couldn't be done...

915
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:21,719
...but the chief said it could.

916
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:25,824
And we'd just begun to get the tools to
get started, when we were in it ourselves...

917
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:29,325
...with a double war and a
50,000-plane paper air force...

918
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:32,090
...that didn't add up to
50 serviceable bombers.

919
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:36,326
Casey, if we'd had in 1941, the
planes you've lost this week...

920
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:39,370
...we'd have had a Munich with the
Japs that would of made Hitler's...

921
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,474
...look like International Rotary.
- We've fought all our lives.

922
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,473
Now we've got to protect our beginnings.

923
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:47,112
- From what? - From Lantze-Wolf
1. Tomorrow's air power.

924
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,249
They're just our acknowledged
enemies. They fight us in the open.

925
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,749
Do you remember the fight we had to
get the first experimental Fortress?

926
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,321
Do you realize how much the Navy
wants our planes for sub patrol...

927
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,392
...and to protect the repairing of those
battleships that air power couldn't hurt?

928
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,758
Do you know how much the Army wants
our pilots for company commanders?

929
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:08,867
Don't you know the British want us
to switch to night area bombardment?

930
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:13,995
And do you know there's a plan to fly
infantry supplies into China with bombers?

931
00:58:14,174 --> 00:58:18,440
Don't you realize the fight it's taken for
Cliff and the others to get us any planes at all?

932
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:20,340
- He's right, Ted.
- And every one...

933
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:23,346
...every one of those factions
is at that meeting right now...

934
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:27,179
...with its own pet plan for winning
this war. By naval blockade...

935
00:58:27,353 --> 00:58:30,948
...or attrition by defensive,
or a good, sound saber charge.

936
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:33,592
And you want me to send the
chief back with nothing...

937
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,957
...but three days of prohibitive losses?
- We demolished Posenleben.

938
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,157
And with time and planes and support, we'll
do the same to every factory in Europe.

939
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,359
But the basic decision is at stake now.

940
00:58:43,536 --> 00:58:45,527
You can worry about Germany, and you should.

941
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,037
But I'm fighting the ground
forces, and the Navy...

942
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:51,974
...and the Congress, and White House, and
the people in the press, and our allies.

943
00:58:52,145 --> 00:58:55,512
Where did I ever get the idea
that this war was against the Axis?

944
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:59,340
You think I don't know
the names the boys call me?

945
00:58:59,652 --> 00:59:02,177
Do you think I've enjoyed
spreading this mug of mine...

946
00:59:02,355 --> 00:59:04,789
...around the press like an eloping heiress?

947
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:09,122
Do you think I don't know what they can
do to me for the statistics I've juggled...

948
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:13,629
...the strike photos I've doctored,
the reports I've gilded and suppressed?

949
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,031
I know, and I'd do it all again.

950
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,228
oh, sit down.

951
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:25,872
Jack Forbes, Pete Baker...

952
00:59:26,045 --> 00:59:29,640
...burned up in those DH
coffins they made us fly.

953
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:34,776
Gene Devlin, trying to prove
we could fly bombs into Alaska.

954
00:59:35,054 --> 00:59:39,320
Judby, Glenson, Torrieli,
in that air-mail mess.

955
00:59:39,592 --> 00:59:41,492
Remember how they got rid of Hugh Enley...

956
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,427
...because he had the guts to stand
up before Congress and tell the truth?

957
00:59:45,598 --> 00:59:50,661
I've spent 20 years, 20 years watching
my friends killed and broken...

958
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:55,103
...and disgraced and
discarded for one single idea.

959
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:58,137
To get our country air power.

960
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:17,893
General Dennis.

961
01:00:18,064 --> 01:00:19,827
Hello, Davis.

962
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:22,627
Never mind the genealogy.

963
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:25,304
Day after tomorrow, huh?

964
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:28,296
okay, call me as you get it.

965
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:31,538
There goes our season's weather, sir.

966
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,544
We make it these two days or
bite our nails off to the elbows.

967
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:38,707
Casey, I appreciate toughness and
independence in my subordinates. I like it.

968
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,682
But I'm not thinking about the weather.

969
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:43,321
I'm thinking about our
whole future, yours too.

970
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,583
And I can't have you fighting
me along with the others.

971
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:49,990
Woody, if I have to fight you
in order to fight the Germans...

972
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:52,723
...you don't leave me any choice.
- That's preposterous.

973
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,426
Is it? Doesn't Washington
understand what's going on here?

974
01:00:56,602 --> 01:01:00,094
You think the Germans would fight if
they weren't scared of our bombardment?

975
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:02,207
The RAF at night, and we in the daytime...

976
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:05,401
...are the only force able
to hit the Germans in Germany.

977
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:08,445
We're doing what no one in
this war has done so far, Cliff.

978
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:11,447
We're making the German air
force fight on our initiative...

979
01:01:11,617 --> 01:01:13,482
...and we're tearing it up over Germany.

980
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:14,642
Make a note of that.

981
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:17,619
German air force has been the
balance of power since Munich.

982
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:19,815
It took the German army everywhere it's been.

983
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:23,826
It beat the Polish air force in three
days, and the Norwegian in three hours.

984
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:26,692
It forced the Maginot Line,
beat the French in three weeks.

985
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:27,855
Homer, get this.

986
01:01:28,034 --> 01:01:30,594
The RAF did win a brilliant
battle from it over England.

987
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,262
But it was a defensive battle, the
kind we're making the Germans fight now.

988
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,465
After that, the Germans were good enough...

989
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:38,974
...to knock off Yugoslavia
and Greece for practice.

990
01:01:39,145 --> 01:01:41,375
To capture Crete and
dominate the Mediterranean.

991
01:01:41,547 --> 01:01:43,947
To chase the Russians back
to Moscow and Stalingrad.

992
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,985
To blockade the North Cape and very nearly
cut the Atlantic lifeline to England.

993
01:01:48,154 --> 01:01:49,587
They would have done it too...

994
01:01:49,756 --> 01:01:52,350
...if their high command
backed them up with more planes.

995
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:55,858
We've made them switch from bomber
production to manufacturing fighters.

996
01:01:56,028 --> 01:01:59,361
We've made them pull whole groups
off the Russians and away from Rommel.

997
01:01:59,532 --> 01:02:01,693
And put them across the channel, facing us.

998
01:02:01,901 --> 01:02:04,961
our people in the Mediterranean are
advancing under aerial supremacy.

999
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,196
Get every word of this.

1000
01:02:06,372 --> 01:02:10,331
Well, get this too, Homer. The
Germans know this better than we do.

1001
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,070
But they're retreating from
their costliest conquests...

1002
01:02:13,246 --> 01:02:16,841
...and they've broken the balance of
their whole air force for just one thing:

1003
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:21,043
They're developing jets to make Europe as
impregnable as the Spitfire's made England.

1004
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,551
They're going to do it too...

1005
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:26,123
...just as sure as we sit here with
our fingers in our mouths and let them.

1006
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:28,487
- Do you want that in too, sir?
- No, not exactly.

1007
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,824
Casey, I agree with you
entirely, but we've got to wait.

1008
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,296
Sir, wars are lost by waiting.

1009
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:35,764
The Allies waited at Munich.

1010
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:38,403
The French and British waited
behind the Maginot Line.

1011
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:40,232
The Germans waited to invade England.

1012
01:02:40,406 --> 01:02:43,534
The Russians waited until they had
to fight without an Allied army.

1013
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:46,177
We waited for a little
more strength to face Japan.

1014
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,040
Now we're forcing the fighting.

1015
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:50,307
But if we wait for the
cycle to swing again...

1016
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:52,917
...we'll wait for the Germans
to put a roof on the continent...

1017
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,586
...to neutralize the Russians...

1018
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:57,222
...then to face our armies
on D-Day at the Channel...

1019
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,824
...with an air force
that's already whipped us.

1020
01:02:59,992 --> 01:03:02,324
I'm not saying operation
Stitch will win the war...

1021
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:08,092
...but no battle anywhere in this war
has been won without aerial supremacy.

1022
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:10,292
You say you're thinking of our future?

1023
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:13,564
operation Stitch is the price of that.

1024
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:22,279
Will you gentlemen wait
in the dining room, please?

1025
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,342
You mean me too, sir?

1026
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:27,816
Yes, I want to talk to General Dennis alone.

1027
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:35,826
General, I wish I'd known about
this the day before yesterday.

1028
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:38,156
I'd like to have helped you all I could.

1029
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,492
That's all right, Mr. Brockhurst.

1030
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,903
Casey, you must think
me incapable of decision.

1031
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,170
Sir, I know that you have many things...

1032
01:03:53,346 --> 01:03:55,780
...on your level to cope
with that I don't have here.

1033
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:59,475
But if Washington screams for blood,
I'll have to throw you to the wolves.

1034
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:00,710
I understand, sir.

1035
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:04,015
And if I have to jettison you,
we lose our best brigadier.

1036
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,124
Thank you, sir, but we're all expendable.

1037
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:10,820
And if they have to jettison me, we'll
probably lose daylight bombardment.

1038
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:13,898
When they sent us here to command,
they expected us to command.

1039
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:15,556
I hope so, Casey...

1040
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:19,796
...because I'm releasing the division
to your discretion with immediate effect.

1041
01:04:20,907 --> 01:04:21,999
Thank you, sir.

1042
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:24,665
You're fully aware of what may happen?

1043
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:26,641
Perfectly, sir.

1044
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:29,180
Well, I hope it doesn't.

1045
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,880
Good luck, my boy.

1046
01:04:45,364 --> 01:04:47,229
- Green light?
- Yeah.

1047
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,233
- George, get me Major Rockton.
- How did it happen?

1048
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:52,064
There's been some slip-up.

1049
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:54,798
The sergeant of the guard
just called. They'll be here.

1050
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,808
Find out who disobeyed my orders. This
is one slip-up that's not going to get by.

1051
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,206
Just a minute, George.

1052
01:05:01,347 --> 01:05:02,871
This really upsets the applecart.

1053
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:07,145
You heard me order that committee be
kept away until day after tomorrow?

1054
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,049
They're here, and they're coming over.

1055
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:11,189
Have you got the tape for operation Stitch?

1056
01:05:11,357 --> 01:05:13,052
- Well, put up...
- What are you doing?

1057
01:05:13,225 --> 01:05:14,590
ordering tomorrow's operation.

1058
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,853
- This changes everything.
- one moment, George.

1059
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:19,429
The impressions of this
committee mean life or death.

1060
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,262
I'm not going to have them watching
the sort of thing we saw this afternoon.

1061
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:25,233
Sir, we can't keep the groups waiting.

1062
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:28,430
I'm sorry, we'll have to pick the
safest naval target we can find.

1063
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:32,271
- Sir, you...
- No more argument, Casey. That's an order.

1064
01:05:35,815 --> 01:05:38,978
Never mind, George. I'll call you back.

1065
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,318
Can you give these
congressmen a decent dinner?

1066
01:05:46,926 --> 01:05:48,416
I hope so, sir.

1067
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:51,256
If Evans hasn't commandeered that chicken.

1068
01:05:54,423 --> 01:05:57,517
And I know he is, and I don't
mind saying that after hearing...

1069
01:05:57,693 --> 01:06:00,457
...what American boys went
through this afternoon...

1070
01:06:00,629 --> 01:06:06,625
...I feel that what I said to the president
in 1940 still stands, in my humble opinion.

1071
01:06:06,802 --> 01:06:08,963
But hold on, Arthur.

1072
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:12,705
Well, sergeant, that looks mighty good.

1073
01:06:13,108 --> 01:06:15,633
Never listen to Italian thieves...

1074
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:18,678
I said, "Mr. President, this is my... "

1075
01:06:20,816 --> 01:06:23,114
Give me the vlP quarters.

1076
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:29,690
Is this the officer in
charge of visitors' quarters?

1077
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:31,849
This is Major Prescott, General Kane's aide.

1078
01:06:32,027 --> 01:06:33,824
Are those rooms ready?

1079
01:06:33,996 --> 01:06:35,657
Clean sheets in all of them?

1080
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:39,130
Good. Be sure you have
a coal fire in each room.

1081
01:06:39,301 --> 01:06:40,893
Now, it's pretty cold.

1082
01:06:41,069 --> 01:06:43,299
Have you any hot-water bottles?

1083
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:45,903
How would I like to what?

1084
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:48,599
oh, very funny.

1085
01:06:49,044 --> 01:06:51,035
"I contend you remind me of someone"...

1086
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:55,012
...I told the president before
this whole thing started.

1087
01:06:56,785 --> 01:07:00,186
Well, we doughboys had
our songs too, you know.

1088
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:09,090
oh, no. No.

1089
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:15,398
Well, Clifton, do you find travel broadening?

1090
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:18,972
You can't walk out of there like this,
Ted. You're almost as bad as Casey.

1091
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:20,472
Were you sent to replace him?

1092
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:22,667
- I don't think so.
- What does Kane think?

1093
01:07:22,845 --> 01:07:26,337
He asked me confidentially if
I'd been sent here to replace him.

1094
01:07:26,515 --> 01:07:30,417
Please, you haven't done anything bad
enough to be a major general, have you?

1095
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,952
Same old rebel, huh, Ted?

1096
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:36,420
Listen, old man, Helen's worried
about you flying missions.

1097
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:38,856
What does she want me to
do? Transfer to infantry?

1098
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:41,154
You can do so much more with your experience.

1099
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,490
What?

1100
01:07:42,664 --> 01:07:45,155
I've been fighting for
bombardment in my own way.

1101
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:49,031
I think the combined chiefs are gonna
give me a B-29 command in the Pacific...

1102
01:07:49,204 --> 01:07:52,765
...to make me prove what I've
been saying. - A B-29 command?

1103
01:07:52,941 --> 01:07:55,774
- Do you realize what that means?
- Well, it means another star.

1104
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:56,933
Star.

1105
01:07:57,112 --> 01:08:00,809
The greatest bomber ever built,
the biggest assignment of the war.

1106
01:08:01,049 --> 01:08:03,745
That's not gonna be conference
fighting. Can you handle it?

1107
01:08:03,919 --> 01:08:07,150
I think I can, with the man I've
picked for my chief of staff.

1108
01:08:07,322 --> 01:08:09,552
- Who's that?
- Brigadier General Ted Martin.

1109
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:11,989
Me? Chief of staff? With all those papers?

1110
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,128
oh, adjutants do that.

1111
01:08:14,296 --> 01:08:15,991
We'll be a perfect team, Ted.

1112
01:08:16,164 --> 01:08:18,997
I'll fight the Navy, and
you can fight the Japs.

1113
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,795
You might try to be more
helpful. Now, get back in there.

1114
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,494
I wanna talk to Casey a minute.

1115
01:08:23,672 --> 01:08:27,802
I'm sticking around for the field order
to come through, then I'm going to turn in.

1116
01:08:29,978 --> 01:08:32,378
Did you listen to what
Congressman Malcolm said?

1117
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:35,346
I've done nothing but listen
to Malcolm for the last hour.

1118
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,382
Good heavens. You must be more careful.

1119
01:08:37,553 --> 01:08:41,250
- He's not chairman, but he's important.
- He's no more important than the others.

1120
01:08:41,423 --> 01:08:43,721
Why should we be rattled
by one noisy individual?

1121
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:46,053
The other fellows seem all right.

1122
01:08:46,228 --> 01:08:49,527
It's precisely because Malcolm
is a troublemaker that I...

1123
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:51,962
- Yes, Homer?
- Representative Malcolm is anxious...

1124
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:54,659
...to get in touch with his
nephew as soon as possible.

1125
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:58,294
- Could we ask Captain Jenks over here?
- You and I must be losing our grips.

1126
01:08:58,473 --> 01:09:00,964
Tell him that Jenks will
be here in a few minutes.

1127
01:09:01,143 --> 01:09:05,102
With all these things exploding at once,
I forgot all about the famous nephew.

1128
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,113
Let's make Malcolm happy. Get
Jenks over here fast as you can.

1129
01:09:08,283 --> 01:09:10,080
- Sir, I'm afraid...
- Say, hasn't Jenks...

1130
01:09:10,252 --> 01:09:12,812
...got another decoration
coming up? Get the citation...

1131
01:09:12,988 --> 01:09:16,583
...and tomorrow afternoon I'll present
the medal to him in Malcolm's presence.

1132
01:09:16,758 --> 01:09:19,955
That's what I mean. I'm afraid
you're asking for something difficult.

1133
01:09:20,128 --> 01:09:23,757
You haven't been told yet, sir, but
Captain Jenks is in rather serious trouble.

1134
01:09:23,932 --> 01:09:24,921
Trouble? Young Jenks?

1135
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,762
Yes, sir. He flatly refused
to fly this morning's mission.

1136
01:09:27,936 --> 01:09:30,166
He's confined to quarters
pending further action.

1137
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:32,864
What? Casey, you're...

1138
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:36,807
Captain Jenks is one of the most highly
- publicized heroes in this Air Force.

1139
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:38,105
I know.

1140
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,738
Maybe he's had too much newspaper
stuff. My people feel that's his trouble.

1141
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,680
- You've had him examined?
- Thoroughly.

1142
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:47,811
The doctors can find no medical
excuse, and Jenks doesn't claim any.

1143
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:52,086
Mightn't this defiance, in itself, indicate
a certain neurosis or a psychic condition?

1144
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,353
Surely nobody will call
Jenks a simple coward.

1145
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:57,259
No, sir. Cowards welcome medical excuses.

1146
01:09:57,432 --> 01:10:00,424
In any case, this is not quite
the moment to be decorating him.

1147
01:10:00,602 --> 01:10:02,570
oh, Casey, we've got to think of something.

1148
01:10:02,738 --> 01:10:05,400
Why, Malcolm wouldn't forgive the Air Force.

1149
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:08,008
- I know one way, sir.
- What?

1150
01:10:08,176 --> 01:10:11,703
If Jenks had been acting under verbal
orders to hold himself in readiness...

1151
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,348
...for special escort duty
to his uncle's committee...

1152
01:10:14,516 --> 01:10:16,848
...he would have been
justified in refusing to fly.

1153
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:19,954
Exactly, exactly, but why must
you do everything the hard way?

1154
01:10:20,122 --> 01:10:21,111
Get him over here.

1155
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:25,157
I will, as soon as I've ordered
Schweinhafen for tomorrow.

1156
01:10:29,231 --> 01:10:30,755
This is blackmail.

1157
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:33,526
For the good of the service,
our bombardment is at stake.

1158
01:10:33,702 --> 01:10:35,465
Ingenious, but you've got your orders.

1159
01:10:35,637 --> 01:10:38,697
Then at midnight, I charge
Captain Jenks with desertion.

1160
01:10:38,874 --> 01:10:39,863
Are you insane?

1161
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:43,739
Don't you realize there'd be an
investigation, press attacks, publicity?

1162
01:10:43,945 --> 01:10:48,006
If the Air Force can't attack what it should,
then an investigation may be a good thing.

1163
01:10:50,686 --> 01:10:53,052
How many years have you known me, Casey?

1164
01:10:53,221 --> 01:10:56,281
Have you ever seen anyone who
got away with blackmailing me?

1165
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:57,857
No, sir.

1166
01:10:58,627 --> 01:11:00,185
All right...

1167
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:03,757
...just so you don't get the wrong idea.

1168
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:07,025
- Are you releasing the division to me?
- You're a scoundrel, Casey.

1169
01:11:07,202 --> 01:11:08,794
You'll get us all hanged in the end.

1170
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:12,428
Go ahead and name your own target for
tomorrow, on your own responsibility.

1171
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:15,303
- I'll notify my headquarters.
- Thank you, sir.

1172
01:11:16,845 --> 01:11:18,176
- on the Greenland icecap.

1173
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:19,404
Get me Colonel Haley.

1174
01:11:19,581 --> 01:11:23,142
The other crew managed to
survive by cutting off his leg...

1175
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,313
All right, this way, men.

1176
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:32,125
Point out the man of the year to
me, I've only got one flashbulb.

1177
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:36,355
Landing under extraordinarily
hazardous conditions...

1178
01:11:36,932 --> 01:11:40,561
Haley, call the 32nd and tell them
I want Captain Jenks released...

1179
01:11:40,736 --> 01:11:42,727
...from all restrictions immediately.

1180
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:46,340
He's to report to my quarters
at once in class A uniform.

1181
01:11:50,345 --> 01:11:53,075
This is General Dennis. Major Rockton.

1182
01:11:57,085 --> 01:11:58,074
George...

1183
01:11:58,253 --> 01:12:02,246
...scrub those naval targets. Have you
still got the tape for Stitch in the printer?

1184
01:12:02,424 --> 01:12:04,221
Good. Send it out.

1185
01:12:04,392 --> 01:12:06,587
Bomb and fuel loadings same as yesterday.

1186
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:10,391
I'll help you with the routes and timings
as soon as I can get away from here.

1187
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:15,002
How did you do it, general?

1188
01:12:16,271 --> 01:12:18,569
It doesn't matter how, Mr. Brockhurst.

1189
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,037
It's on.

1190
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:49,536
<i>Yes, it was on.</i>

1191
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:54,197
<i>Once again, Dennis' command
set the big machine in motion.</i>

1192
01:12:54,376 --> 01:12:58,278
<i>Bomb loads, fusings, target
intelligence plot Hitler's flak guns.</i>

1193
01:12:59,915 --> 01:13:01,610
<i>This was no raid tomorrow.</i>

1194
01:13:01,783 --> 01:13:05,150
<i>No gallant dash to the target and out again.</i>

1195
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,412
<i>This was a battle.</i>

1196
01:13:07,088 --> 01:13:08,885
<i>Here and from other fields...</i>

1197
01:13:09,057 --> 01:13:12,458
<i>...hundreds of Forts and
Libs would rise at dawn...</i>

1198
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:14,117
<i>...higher than men can dream.</i>

1199
01:13:14,963 --> 01:13:16,863
<i>Kids who worked in drugstores last year...</i>

1200
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,868
<i>...played at the country
clubs, failed in algebra...</i>

1201
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:23,800
<i>...would guide the formation
to the heart of Germany...</i>

1202
01:13:23,972 --> 01:13:26,463
<i>...with instruments Marconi
and Edison never knew.</i>

1203
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,302
<i>The field order went down.</i>

1204
01:13:28,476 --> 01:13:31,001
<i>Division to combat wings, wings to groups.</i>

1205
01:13:31,179 --> 01:13:33,943
okay, there's a mission
tomorrow, maximum effort.

1206
01:13:34,616 --> 01:13:36,880
<i>Six hundred miles through
the fighters and flak...</i>

1207
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:41,212
<i>...fastened to life by short hoses of oxygen.</i>

1208
01:13:41,389 --> 01:13:44,552
<i>Six hundred miles to come home again.</i>

1209
01:13:44,726 --> 01:13:46,091
<i>Maybe.</i>

1210
01:13:46,461 --> 01:13:50,557
<i>A thundering battle force 30 miles long.</i>

1211
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:55,403
<i>All this now for a four-minute bomb run...</i>

1212
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:58,971
<i>...over one small vital town in Germany.</i>

1213
01:14:00,275 --> 01:14:04,575
<i>Once more, the patient ground
crews loaded the tons of bombs...</i>

1214
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:07,145
<i>...preflighted the engines...</i>

1215
01:14:09,084 --> 01:14:10,608
<i>...checked every wire.</i>

1216
01:14:10,785 --> 01:14:12,514
<i>On this base, as on all the bases...</i>

1217
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:16,555
<i>...the combat men could sleep
safe in that knowledge at least.</i>

1218
01:14:16,725 --> 01:14:21,253
<i>Two thousand, seven-hundred eighty
gallons of gas in each Fortress.</i>

1219
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:24,990
<i>Enough materials and guts
and skill to run a city.</i>

1220
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,633
<i>Now it was nearly ready.</i>

1221
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,827
<i>The men on the ground had
almost done their work.</i>

1222
01:14:30,005 --> 01:14:32,371
<i>The engines were still again.</i>

1223
01:14:32,674 --> 01:14:37,202
<i>The dark fields silent,
waiting for the crews.</i>

1224
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:48,217
<i>Three o'clock, and all over
England at this exact moment...</i>

1225
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,358
<i>...they roused them from their sleep.</i>

1226
01:14:50,525 --> 01:14:53,426
We have a mission this morning.
Breakfast in half an hour.

1227
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:54,619
Breakfast at 4:00?

1228
01:14:54,796 --> 01:14:57,162
<i>It had always been a heartbreaker to watch.</i>

1229
01:14:57,332 --> 01:15:00,233
<i>But this morning, I felt the
whole story for the first time.</i>

1230
01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:04,370
<i>Not just the kids who
wouldn't come back today.</i>

1231
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:06,564
<i>A deeper meaning in their sacrifice.</i>

1232
01:15:07,642 --> 01:15:09,269
<i>Dennis' fight...</i>

1233
01:15:09,444 --> 01:15:10,934
<i>...and Kane's.</i>

1234
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:14,138
<i>Our own long carelessness at home.</i>

1235
01:15:14,316 --> 01:15:16,477
Your target for today is Schweinhafen.

1236
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,286
<i>It was all in the kids' hands now.</i>

1237
01:16:29,257 --> 01:16:30,622
Well...

1238
01:16:30,992 --> 01:16:32,550
...see you later.

1239
01:16:34,496 --> 01:16:36,896
- Keep your temper with the big wheels.
- What?

1240
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:39,892
I said keep your temper with the big wheels.

1241
01:16:40,068 --> 01:16:44,368
I don't wanna get back and find you
with a Legion of Merit and a ticket home.

1242
01:18:56,137 --> 01:18:57,866
- Good morning, general.
- Good morning.

1243
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:00,405
- Good morning.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

1244
01:19:04,379 --> 01:19:06,540
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1245
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:10,915
Well, this is really worth getting up to see.

1246
01:19:11,753 --> 01:19:14,950
Let's hope and pray that all of
our boys will come back this time.

1247
01:19:20,495 --> 01:19:23,953
- Is that Colonel Martin?
- Yes, the first one.

1248
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:30,034
You know, my boy, when I see all of this,
I can't help but feel a little bit guilty.

1249
01:19:30,205 --> 01:19:32,400
If I weren't here, you'd
probably be up there...

1250
01:19:32,574 --> 01:19:34,701
...in Colonel Martin's
ship leading them today.

1251
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:43,144
I suppose nobody ever really gets
used to this, does he, general?

1252
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:44,849
Never.

1253
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,780
I can imagine.

1254
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:48,953
Weird.

1255
01:19:49,257 --> 01:19:52,590
The weirdest kind of war on Earth, Mr. Stone.

1256
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:56,861
A few hours from now, they'll be fighting
on oxygen five miles over Germany.

1257
01:19:58,032 --> 01:20:01,263
Tonight, some of them will
be dancing at The Savoy...

1258
01:20:01,736 --> 01:20:04,671
...and some of them will still be in Germany.

1259
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:10,366
- Yes, sir.
- Right-o.

1260
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:12,172
The air crews should
hardly get their feet wet.

1261
01:20:12,347 --> 01:20:14,008
Hello, 16 Group.

1262
01:20:14,182 --> 01:20:17,447
Wrecked aircraft, priority
flying control, please.

1263
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:21,755
Fifth division here. We have a B-17 early
return reported fixed in the North Sea.

1264
01:20:21,923 --> 01:20:23,322
What do you know?

1265
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:25,186
What's cooking? Something hot?

1266
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:28,628
- That's something. Look at that.
- This calls for a celebration.

1267
01:20:28,863 --> 01:20:31,923
- Imagine that.
- Well, what do you know?

1268
01:20:32,934 --> 01:20:35,198
Here it is, George. He
really hit the jackpot.

1269
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:38,168
- Strike signal already?
- This is Mrs. Martin's strike signal.

1270
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:40,102
Cable from the States for the colonel.

1271
01:20:40,275 --> 01:20:43,711
"New 8-pound copilot made
first landing 4:14 this morning.

1272
01:20:43,878 --> 01:20:45,345
Everything fine. Helen. "

1273
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:47,071
Well, how about that?

1274
01:20:47,248 --> 01:20:49,512
Colonel Martin's got a son.

1275
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:53,551
- Hold the phones...
- Enemy fighters attacking. Roger.

1276
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:57,487
The German air force has been the balance
of power in the world ever since Munich.

1277
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:00,219
It took the German army everywhere it's been.

1278
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:04,923
It beat the Polish air force in three
days, and the Norwegian in three hours.

1279
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:08,398
It forced the Maginot Line, and
beat the French in three weeks.

1280
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:12,368
It knocked off Yugoslavia
and Greece for practice.

1281
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,407
Captured Crete and dominated
the Mediterranean...

1282
01:21:15,576 --> 01:21:19,171
...and chased the Russians
back to Moscow and Stalingrad.

1283
01:21:19,347 --> 01:21:21,508
Now we've made them pull whole groups...

1284
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:24,379
...off the Russians and away
from the Mediterranean...

1285
01:21:24,552 --> 01:21:29,888
...and put them over there,
across the channel, facing us.

1286
01:21:30,358 --> 01:21:33,327
Gentlemen, you've had a glimpse...

1287
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:36,292
...but all the complicated
activities of this division...

1288
01:21:36,464 --> 01:21:40,195
...are only a fraction of
General Kane's responsibility.

1289
01:21:41,736 --> 01:21:43,465
All right, Homer.

1290
01:21:44,038 --> 01:21:47,064
Gentlemen, you must make
the country understand...

1291
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:50,369
...that the credit for what
we do here belongs to the boys.

1292
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,576
often at night, I think on
the parable of the talents.

1293
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:59,515
It must have been a terrible
ordeal for those men...

1294
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:03,123
...who were trying to serve
their master as best they could...

1295
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:05,486
...with what they were given.

1296
01:22:05,693 --> 01:22:07,854
You mean you want more planes, General.

1297
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:11,430
Mr. Stone, if the nation wants
aerial supremacy, we must have them.

1298
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:13,999
The nation wants aerial supremacy everywhere.

1299
01:22:14,168 --> 01:22:16,864
Excuse me. What is it, George?

1300
01:22:17,038 --> 01:22:19,802
A message I thought you'd like to see, sir.

1301
01:22:22,944 --> 01:22:26,880
Well, it looks like it's going to be
pretty noisy over the 32nd tonight.

1302
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:29,011
Congratulations, uncle.

1303
01:22:29,183 --> 01:22:33,051
Excuse us, gentlemen, but this is a first
- priority communication.

1304
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:36,022
- Colonel Martin's got a boy.
- Wonderful.

1305
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,249
Well, I can't tell you what this means to us.

1306
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:40,654
I've known Colonel Martin for 15 years.

1307
01:22:40,828 --> 01:22:42,420
Why, this is as if I'd had a...

1308
01:22:42,597 --> 01:22:45,589
Well, I won't say a grandson,
but another son of my own.

1309
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:47,359
- Wonderful.
- General Kane...

1310
01:22:47,535 --> 01:22:51,699
...it's an inspiring thing for us to come
over here and see the American flag flying...

1311
01:22:51,873 --> 01:22:55,741
...and to be privileged to inspect these
fine achievements of our bomber boys.

1312
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:58,504
Howsomever, I'd like to
get back to this mission...

1313
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:01,239
...that Colonel Martin is leading today.

1314
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:05,443
General Dennis, if I may, I'm
gonna ask you a few questions.

1315
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:12,118
You explained a while ago
that this was as far...

1316
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:16,389
...as your bomber planes could depend
upon protection from our fighter planes.

1317
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:20,325
And I think you also said that
for the third day in succession...

1318
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:23,834
...your bombers have been deliberately
sent far beyond this limit.

1319
01:23:24,405 --> 01:23:26,236
- That's correct.
- In other words...

1320
01:23:26,407 --> 01:23:29,604
...about half your plane strength,
and the lives of a thousand men...

1321
01:23:29,777 --> 01:23:31,802
...have been lost within the last two days...

1322
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:34,709
...and we still don't
know about this afternoon.

1323
01:23:34,882 --> 01:23:37,646
- Has this been entirely your decision?
- It has.

1324
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:40,253
- on nothing but your own authority?
- Yes.

1325
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:43,384
General Dennis was quite within
his authority, Mr. Malcolm.

1326
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:45,685
When these losses are
fitted into the average...

1327
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,351
oh, I understand the
overall average, general.

1328
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:51,225
And I appreciate your
loyalty to your subordinate.

1329
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:55,699
But it seems to me our boys are paying a
bloody price for General Dennis' record.

1330
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,031
They're paying a price
for the country's record.

1331
01:23:58,206 --> 01:24:00,674
So the country is responsible
for your sending them...

1332
01:24:00,842 --> 01:24:03,208
...far beyond friendly fighter cover?
- Yes.

1333
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:06,972
or more precisely, some of the
country's elected representatives.

1334
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:08,809
May I ask how?

1335
01:24:08,983 --> 01:24:12,714
How did you vote on appropriations
for the Air Force in 1938?

1336
01:24:12,987 --> 01:24:15,012
- What?
- How did you vote on appropriations...

1337
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:16,713
...for the Air Force in 1938?

1338
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:18,381
By golly, he's got you, Arthur.

1339
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:20,322
Well, we'll see who's got who.

1340
01:24:20,495 --> 01:24:23,259
General Kane, I appreciate
that things can happen...

1341
01:24:23,431 --> 01:24:25,296
...at command when your back is turned.

1342
01:24:25,466 --> 01:24:27,991
But on behalf of the American
people, I'm warning you.

1343
01:24:28,169 --> 01:24:32,071
- one more of these murderous attacks...
- Arthur, it's not our place to criticize.

1344
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,641
- If they think it's necessary...
- Necessary to slaughter American youth...

1345
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,472
...just because a brigadier...?
- May I remind you again...

1346
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:41,046
...our operations are
governed by military directive.

1347
01:24:41,215 --> 01:24:42,477
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1348
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:45,050
While Major Lansing briefs
you further on details...

1349
01:24:45,219 --> 01:24:48,188
...General Dennis and I will get
some up-to- minute information...

1350
01:24:48,356 --> 01:24:52,122
...on where our planes are
right now. Casey. Major.

1351
01:25:07,475 --> 01:25:10,603
Casey, I've seen some bad
things in my time. This is it.

1352
01:25:10,778 --> 01:25:12,609
Why keep on antagonizing Malcolm?

1353
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,146
It's been his lead so far.

1354
01:25:15,316 --> 01:25:19,514
You know the way I feel about you and
how the chief has always felt about you.

1355
01:25:19,687 --> 01:25:21,951
Well, this is bigger than any friendship.

1356
01:25:22,123 --> 01:25:25,217
You've heard Malcolm
warn me. I'm warning you.

1357
01:25:25,393 --> 01:25:27,224
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

1358
01:25:27,395 --> 01:25:30,523
You wait here and cool off a little
while I try and smooth him down.

1359
01:25:30,698 --> 01:25:32,666
This is really my kind of war anyway.

1360
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,801
You're welcome to it.

1361
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:37,367
Everything arranged for Jenks' presentation?

1362
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,768
- Plenty to drink?
- I hadn't thought of that.

1363
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:42,910
Well, you better start
thinking in doubles and triples.

1364
01:25:44,745 --> 01:25:46,906
- Evans.
- Yes, sir.

1365
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:50,107
- We gotta get some liquor in here.
- I could duck over to the club.

1366
01:25:50,284 --> 01:25:52,149
You haven't much time.

1367
01:25:54,388 --> 01:25:56,481
Now wait a minute. I
said, "Mr. President... "

1368
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:58,921
They're coming out of the ops room now.

1369
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,754
I knew there was a catch to this job.

1370
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:21,304
- Where did you get that?
- Present from an admirer, sir.

1371
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:22,744
And it still is.

1372
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,817
Nonsense, you can get a fortune for this.

1373
01:26:24,986 --> 01:26:29,582
oh, no, sir. There's just one thing I'd
like, sir, that's to shake your hand.

1374
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:30,746
What's this for?

1375
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:35,225
For telling that servant of the people where
to get off. I didn't know you had it in you.

1376
01:26:37,064 --> 01:26:39,532
Well, you better get some water and glasses.

1377
01:26:40,901 --> 01:26:42,300
Evans...

1378
01:26:43,771 --> 01:26:44,829
...I appreciate this.

1379
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:49,369
Well, sir, I'd hate
breaking in a new general.

1380
01:26:49,844 --> 01:26:53,610
Cycle relay reports Red Leader
is on course 20 miles from target.

1381
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:56,215
Reconnaissance reports large
formation of enemy fighters.

1382
01:26:56,384 --> 01:26:58,011
Did you get the strike signal yet?

1383
01:26:58,185 --> 01:26:59,846
All right, do that.

1384
01:27:00,488 --> 01:27:01,750
All right, this way, men.

1385
01:27:01,922 --> 01:27:04,482
Well, look here, real
American drinking whiskey.

1386
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:06,650
Where in the world did you get it over here?

1387
01:27:06,827 --> 01:27:10,490
- Looks as if the Navy's doing you good.
- Are you in touch with the relay ship?

1388
01:27:10,998 --> 01:27:14,263
Well, prepare a relay of
that cable about Ted's kid.

1389
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:17,596
When he gets where we could
reach him, shoot it to his plane.

1390
01:27:17,805 --> 01:27:21,002
General Kane, are you fixing to
have this decoration ceremony?

1391
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:23,973
Right now, Mr. Malcolm. Just
as soon as General Dennis...

1392
01:27:24,145 --> 01:27:26,272
I'm proud of you, son, mighty proud.

1393
01:27:26,447 --> 01:27:29,848
Well, this is a happy coincidence,
my being here and seeing all this.

1394
01:27:30,017 --> 01:27:33,919
And, boys, I want a picture that will
make all America proud of the captain here.

1395
01:27:34,088 --> 01:27:35,851
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1396
01:27:39,393 --> 01:27:40,985
"No mistake this time.

1397
01:27:41,162 --> 01:27:44,222
Scratch Schweinhafen for me. Ted. "

1398
01:27:45,466 --> 01:27:47,593
- Haley, he got it.
- Good old Martin.

1399
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:50,635
- Good for Ted, Schweinhafen.
- Gentlemen.

1400
01:27:50,805 --> 01:27:53,740
To Ted Martin, the greatest combat
leader in the Army Air Force.

1401
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:55,535
- To Colonel Martin.
- Here's to Ted.

1402
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:58,144
- Wonderful.
- And to Colonel Martin's son.

1403
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:01,748
- To Colonel Martin's son.
- To Colonel Martin's son.

1404
01:28:02,817 --> 01:28:05,081
Brockie, I want a featured
story on Ted for this.

1405
01:28:05,252 --> 01:28:08,221
General Kane, you seem to be
forgetting about me and Lucius here.

1406
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:11,119
You wanted a picture to be
proud of. Will you get in this?

1407
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:14,784
General, Colonel Martin's message asked
you to scratch Schweinhafen for him.

1408
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:19,956
- While the photographers are still here...
-  Lucius, stand by me. Come on, come on.

1409
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:24,995
- Well, we're ready.
- oh, excuse me, sir.

1410
01:28:25,172 --> 01:28:28,403
Would the gentleman like to put his
glass over here before it starts?

1411
01:28:28,576 --> 01:28:32,273
oh, sure, sure. You'll go
a long way in life, son.

1412
01:28:32,446 --> 01:28:34,539
Pull your blouse down
over your hips, general.

1413
01:28:34,715 --> 01:28:36,114
oh, yes.

1414
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:38,379
Ready?

1415
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,053
Now then, I think we better
go ahead with the presentation.

1416
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:43,520
Yes, certainly.

1417
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:46,586
Come along, Lucius.
That's what we're here for.

1418
01:28:47,461 --> 01:28:49,452
Attention to orders.

1419
01:28:50,564 --> 01:28:54,398
"Headquarters, 8th Air Force,
United States Army. Paragraph 2.

1420
01:28:54,568 --> 01:28:56,900
General order number 426.

1421
01:28:57,071 --> 01:29:00,802
For outstanding, heroic, and meritorious
conduct in action against the enemy...

1422
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:04,308
...the following officers are awarded
the Distinguished Flying Cross.

1423
01:29:04,478 --> 01:29:10,474
Captain Lucius M. Jenks, o-33902,
32nd Bombardment Group, Heavy.

1424
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:14,587
In action against the enemy, Captain
Lucius Jenks has displayed heroic...

1425
01:29:14,755 --> 01:29:17,019
...and meritorious conduct... "

1426
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:50,085
"Good luck, Casey. We're on fire and going. "

1427
01:29:55,696 --> 01:29:57,129
Going?

1428
01:29:57,364 --> 01:29:59,457
Finish the message, can't you?

1429
01:29:59,767 --> 01:30:00,791
That's all there is.

1430
01:30:00,968 --> 01:30:02,902
Well, what's it mean? Who sent that?

1431
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,833
It's from my ship.

1432
01:30:06,807 --> 01:30:08,138
You mean Colonel Martin?

1433
01:30:08,309 --> 01:30:10,834
That same fine officer I
shook hands with this morning?

1434
01:30:11,011 --> 01:30:12,478
- Shut up.
- You mean to tell me...?

1435
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:14,546
- Shut up!
- You're telling me to shut up...

1436
01:30:14,715 --> 01:30:17,616
...and you're the one that's responsible?
- Will you shut up?

1437
01:30:17,785 --> 01:30:20,948
Can't you understand that some
guys have to do more than talk?

1438
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:27,017
Lucius.

1439
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:30,429
- General Dennis...
- Arthur...

1440
01:30:30,598 --> 01:30:31,963
...I think you've said enough.

1441
01:30:32,132 --> 01:30:35,363
I'd advise you to follow
that suggestion, Mr. Malcolm.

1442
01:30:57,725 --> 01:31:00,660
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I'll
have to ask you to excuse me.

1443
01:31:00,828 --> 01:31:02,989
It's time to start
planning tomorrow's mission.

1444
01:31:03,163 --> 01:31:05,131
Certainly, general.

1445
01:32:07,928 --> 01:32:10,556
<i>Right side, bandit at 2 o'clock.</i>

1446
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:14,797
<i>- B- 17 on fire.
- Bandit at 3.</i>

1447
01:32:19,907 --> 01:32:22,239
<i>B
- 17 going down at 3 o'clock.</i>

1448
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:24,877
<i>Three chutes. Three of
them got out. Got that?</i>

1449
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:26,774
<i>- Bombs away.
- More bandits, 6 o'clock.</i>

1450
01:32:26,947 --> 01:32:28,881
<i>Bombardier to crew. Bomb bay doors...</i>

1451
01:32:29,049 --> 01:32:31,677
<i>- There goes another one.
- Bombs away. Bandit at 3.</i>

1452
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:33,615
<i>- Bombs away.
- Lead ship's hit.</i>

1453
01:32:33,787 --> 01:32:35,880
<i>Yup, they caught Martin. Number 2 is on fire.</i>

1454
01:32:36,056 --> 01:32:37,045
<i>Bomb bay doors open.</i>

1455
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:39,351
<i>- Waist to pilot. Kelly is hit.
- Bombs away.</i>

1456
01:32:39,526 --> 01:32:40,515
<i>Pilot to crew...</i>

1457
01:32:40,694 --> 01:32:43,720
<i>...Colonel Martin is turning out
of formation. Deputy taking over.</i>

1458
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,762
<i>- Bombs away.
- Bombs away.</i>

1459
01:32:45,933 --> 01:32:49,130
<i>Hey, how about that evasive action?
We're flying for ourselves now.</i>

1460
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:52,739
<i>Come on, let's get out of
here. I've got a date in London.</i>

1461
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,265
Listen, Casey...

1462
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:24,131
...the old man just said that
he's afraid you aren't well.

1463
01:33:24,304 --> 01:33:26,602
Take it easy. He's scared.

1464
01:33:27,474 --> 01:33:31,774
He wasn't scared back at Rockwell in the
'20s when he broke those altitude records.

1465
01:33:32,846 --> 01:33:35,041
You know, if it had worked out...

1466
01:33:35,215 --> 01:33:38,582
...I was gonna ask you to let
me have Ted for the Pacific.

1467
01:33:38,752 --> 01:33:40,879
I could have made him a brigadier in a month.

1468
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:42,989
Did Ted know that?

1469
01:33:43,157 --> 01:33:46,820
Maybe I shouldn't have, but I
mentioned it to him last night.

1470
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:50,487
I wish I'd known it at 3:00 this morning.

1471
01:33:52,366 --> 01:33:54,561
Someone will have to tell Helen.

1472
01:33:54,735 --> 01:33:56,362
I'll tell her.

1473
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:01,798
Here it is, sir. These latest
pictures are especially interesting.

1474
01:34:01,975 --> 01:34:04,068
The weather will hold up another day, sir.

1475
01:34:04,244 --> 01:34:06,940
I'll have a 1400 map for you in a minute.

1476
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:11,384
oh, I thought you were alone, Casey.

1477
01:34:11,552 --> 01:34:13,986
Excuse us, please, gentlemen.

1478
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:23,519
I know you've had a lot to unstring you.

1479
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:25,392
I'm sorry.

1480
01:34:27,301 --> 01:34:31,237
What target were you
thinking of for tomorrow?

1481
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:39,608
Fendelhorst.

1482
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:45,049
We got one more day to
finish operation Stitch.

1483
01:34:47,087 --> 01:34:48,987
No matter what it costs?

1484
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:52,716
You know the answer to that.

1485
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,564
Casey, you leave me no alternative.

1486
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:06,797
I'm relieving you of your
command with immediate effect.

1487
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:09,809
I'm sorry, my boy.

1488
01:35:17,584 --> 01:35:20,951
I'm going to recommend you
for the Legion of Merit.

1489
01:35:31,131 --> 01:35:32,120
Mr. Brockhurst?

1490
01:35:32,499 --> 01:35:35,559
Well, you better get the lead
out. He's leaving at 10:00.

1491
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:37,135
Right.

1492
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:50,015
Good evening, sergeant. Good evening, sir.

1493
01:35:50,184 --> 01:35:52,982
- Anything from General Kane?
- No, sir.

1494
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:57,589
- What's all that racket outside?
- Just some visitors from the 32nd, sir.

1495
01:35:57,758 --> 01:35:58,986
Well, call the guardhouse.

1496
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:02,128
Excuse me, sir. May I
attend to this for you, sir?

1497
01:36:02,296 --> 01:36:03,820
Yes.

1498
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:08,493
Hey, you out there. Go back
to your group and shut up!

1499
01:36:08,669 --> 01:36:10,694
Who's telling me to shut up?

1500
01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:11,929
I am.

1501
01:36:12,105 --> 01:36:13,766
Do you know who I am?

1502
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,602
I don't wanna know who you are.

1503
01:36:15,776 --> 01:36:19,906
Well, I am Captain George
Washington Bellpepper Lee.

1504
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,413
Well, I am Technical
Sergeant Immanuel T. Evans.

1505
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:25,814
oh, a technical sergeant, huh?

1506
01:36:25,986 --> 01:36:30,252
Speaking for Brigadier
General Clifton I. Garnet.

1507
01:36:33,894 --> 01:36:35,225
Thank you, sir.

1508
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:36,623
Thank you, sergeant.

1509
01:36:36,797 --> 01:36:39,561
- Ask Colonel Haley to step in.
- Yes, sir.

1510
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,625
This is a very special
night, sir. They're veterans.

1511
01:36:42,803 --> 01:36:45,271
A little oxygen in the
morning will fix them right up.

1512
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:49,773
You see, sir, they know they can
fly a milk run tomorrow sound asleep.

1513
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:54,212
Does the division just assume that if I'm
left on my own I would order a milk run?

1514
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:55,939
I'm not assuming, sir.

1515
01:36:56,116 --> 01:36:57,447
That's what I came in to ask.

1516
01:36:57,618 --> 01:37:00,086
Well, we'd better start
thinking about it, major.

1517
01:37:00,354 --> 01:37:04,415
Ask Major Lansing to bring me the
folders on the naval targets in France.

1518
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:07,259
You asked for me, sir?

1519
01:37:07,427 --> 01:37:08,860
Yes, Earnie.

1520
01:37:09,029 --> 01:37:11,896
Does Kane usually wait this
long to give us the target?

1521
01:37:12,065 --> 01:37:14,090
That depends on what the target will be, sir.

1522
01:37:14,268 --> 01:37:16,236
According to this directive you showed me...

1523
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:20,362
Yes, sir. If we've no word from
General Kane's headquarters by 1900...

1524
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,100
...the choice of the
target will be up to you.

1525
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:25,478
I see.

1526
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,043
Tell me, Earnie...

1527
01:37:28,882 --> 01:37:32,818
Well, now that we're going to be so
close, couldn't you at least stand at ease?

1528
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:34,476
Yes, sir.

1529
01:37:37,824 --> 01:37:41,123
Do you really think that the
change of command has helped morale?

1530
01:37:41,295 --> 01:37:43,354
All generals look alike to them, sir.

1531
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:47,193
They feel a new general is always
good for a couple of soft missions.

1532
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:50,801
All right, Haley. Thank you.

1533
01:37:55,342 --> 01:37:58,277
- I didn't order coffee.
- You will, sir.

1534
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,715
- What else will I need, Evans?
- You'll need a new sergeant, sir.

1535
01:38:03,383 --> 01:38:04,748
What?

1536
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:09,648
- You're going to work for General Dennis?
- No, sir. He wouldn't take me.

1537
01:38:10,424 --> 01:38:13,621
I've decided to go to
Nevada to teach gunnery.

1538
01:38:13,794 --> 01:38:15,659
You've decided?

1539
01:38:15,829 --> 01:38:19,595
- What do you think this Army is?
- I'd rather not answer that, sir.

1540
01:38:21,468 --> 01:38:24,960
But War Department circular 69587-3...

1541
01:38:25,138 --> 01:38:29,939
...says applications from graduate gunners
to teach aerial gunnery will be accepted.

1542
01:38:31,611 --> 01:38:34,375
Well, if the circular authorizes it...

1543
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:38,643
- Evans.
- Yes, sir.

1544
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:42,880
- You are a graduate gunner?
- Yes, sir, 28 missions.

1545
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:47,283
Would it be too much to ask these
boys for a tough one tomorrow?

1546
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:48,758
I don't know, sir.

1547
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:50,863
You must know from your own experience.

1548
01:38:51,031 --> 01:38:52,555
Never had this experience, sir.

1549
01:38:52,733 --> 01:38:56,829
Nobody in the Army ever asked
me anything. They just told me.

1550
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:18,981
Captain Lee reports his presence, sir.

1551
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:20,148
Who?

1552
01:39:20,327 --> 01:39:23,956
Captain George Washington
Bellpepper Lee, sir.

1553
01:39:24,131 --> 01:39:25,962
Lee, you're drunk.

1554
01:39:26,299 --> 01:39:27,698
Yes, sir.

1555
01:39:27,868 --> 01:39:30,166
I've come in to report
myself for that, sir...

1556
01:39:30,337 --> 01:39:34,603
...and to apologize for singing under
your window and then running away.

1557
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:38,567
- Get out of here and go to bed.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1558
01:39:38,745 --> 01:39:41,839
This hasn't happened
before and it won't again.

1559
01:39:42,416 --> 01:39:43,781
Lee.

1560
01:39:47,487 --> 01:39:50,251
Did you go to Schweinhafen today?

1561
01:39:50,424 --> 01:39:54,258
Yes, sir. I went to Schweinhafen today.

1562
01:39:54,461 --> 01:39:57,089
I went to Schweinhafen yesterday...

1563
01:39:57,798 --> 01:40:00,892
...and I went to Posenleben on Friday.

1564
01:40:01,067 --> 01:40:03,331
I've been to Hamburg...

1565
01:40:03,503 --> 01:40:06,063
...and Bremen and Kiel...

1566
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,675
...Schweinfurt, Regensburg...

1567
01:40:11,244 --> 01:40:12,939
Excuse me, sir.

1568
01:40:13,113 --> 01:40:17,174
I only meant to say I've been to
24 of them without taking a drink...

1569
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:22,083
...and I'm ashamed of myself for singing
under your window on Easter Sunday.

1570
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,855
You go to bed, Lee.

1571
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,018
It's all right.

1572
01:40:30,197 --> 01:40:32,222
Even if it isn't Easter Sunday.

1573
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:35,459
I beg your pardon, sir.
It's my Easter Sunday.

1574
01:40:35,635 --> 01:40:38,069
- Yours?
- Yes, sir.

1575
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:40,138
Resurrection, sir.

1576
01:40:40,307 --> 01:40:41,934
Today was my 24th.

1577
01:40:42,476 --> 01:40:47,004
See, all I gotta do now is knock
off one more little milk run...

1578
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:50,308
...and I can go home and
live the rest of my life.

1579
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:55,913
Well, don't behave like this at home.

1580
01:40:56,089 --> 01:40:57,920
I wouldn't think of it, sir.

1581
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:59,683
I'm getting married.

1582
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,555
Well, congratulations.

1583
01:41:01,728 --> 01:41:03,286
Yes, sir.

1584
01:41:03,463 --> 01:41:06,023
We almost did before I came over...

1585
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:09,100
...but, well, sir, I thought
she'd worry more that way.

1586
01:41:09,269 --> 01:41:10,702
I see.

1587
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:13,499
Well, you get to bed. Best of luck.

1588
01:41:13,673 --> 01:41:15,573
Thank you, sir.

1589
01:41:19,513 --> 01:41:22,311
And a happy Easter to you, sir.

1590
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:40,162
Here are the folders on those channel port
targets, general. Calais, Dunkirk, Brest.

1591
01:41:43,136 --> 01:41:45,366
- What are these?
- Pictures from the last group...

1592
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:48,565
...over Schweinhafen, sir. Look
at those hits on the milling shop.

1593
01:41:48,742 --> 01:41:50,835
They did a wonderful job.

1594
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:55,504
- Then it's complete?
- Schweinhafen is complete, sir.

1595
01:41:55,715 --> 01:41:57,182
I see.

1596
01:41:58,285 --> 01:42:00,685
Major, I'd like to ask you a question.

1597
01:42:00,854 --> 01:42:02,378
Yes, sir?

1598
01:42:02,556 --> 01:42:05,457
If you had to decide tomorrow's
mission for General Kane...

1599
01:42:06,059 --> 01:42:08,186
...would you attack Fendelhorst?

1600
01:42:08,361 --> 01:42:10,329
Fendelhorst, sir?

1601
01:42:10,497 --> 01:42:12,624
I'm thankful I don't have to decide that.

1602
01:42:12,799 --> 01:42:14,027
But if you did?

1603
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,330
Sir, I'm afraid my decision would
be influenced by a personal reason.

1604
01:42:18,505 --> 01:42:20,496
May I ask what it is?

1605
01:42:20,674 --> 01:42:25,111
General, I regret intruding this upon
your consideration, but since you ask me...

1606
01:42:25,278 --> 01:42:30,113
...I have a son training now in a
combat infantry division, assault.

1607
01:42:30,283 --> 01:42:32,410
When those jets have
stopped our bombardment...

1608
01:42:32,586 --> 01:42:36,317
...they'll make the deadliest strafing
planes ever used against ground troops.

1609
01:42:37,023 --> 01:42:41,221
I'm sorry, sir, but I couldn't help thinking
of my boy going up a beach against them.

1610
01:42:41,394 --> 01:42:44,693
Yes, but what if your boy
were flying a bomber tomorrow?

1611
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:48,327
I hope I'd send him to Fendelhorst, sir.

1612
01:42:54,107 --> 01:42:55,631
Message from General Kane, sir.

1613
01:42:55,809 --> 01:42:57,800
Good. Read it.

1614
01:42:57,978 --> 01:42:59,639
"General Kane compelled to attend...

1615
01:42:59,813 --> 01:43:01,940
...ambassador's dinner
for congressmen, London.

1616
01:43:02,115 --> 01:43:04,675
Pursuant to directive,
selection of tomorrow's target...

1617
01:43:04,851 --> 01:43:07,081
...will be responsibility
of senior commander.

1618
01:43:07,253 --> 01:43:10,620
General Kane desires express confidence
in General Garnet's discretion...

1619
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:14,590
...based on weather.
Signed, Malloway for Kane. "

1620
01:43:41,688 --> 01:43:45,556
I don't know about that. From the eccentric
way that cold mass has developed...

1621
01:43:45,725 --> 01:43:47,249
Never mind the genealogy, major.

1622
01:43:47,427 --> 01:43:49,793
The synoptic situation
will be highly unfavorable.

1623
01:43:49,963 --> 01:43:52,090
That will mean bad weather
for quite some time.

1624
01:43:52,265 --> 01:43:54,426
- And tomorrow?
- Well, tomorrow you're all right.

1625
01:43:54,601 --> 01:43:56,466
I understand that, major.

1626
01:43:56,636 --> 01:43:58,297
oh, Casey. Sorry, I didn't see you.

1627
01:43:58,471 --> 01:44:00,666
Come in, old man. That'll be all, gentlemen.

1628
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,967
I'll let you know my decision.

1629
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:05,202
- Goodbye, general.
- Goodbye.

1630
01:44:05,378 --> 01:44:07,312
See you at the plane, Casey.

1631
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,077
- Bye again, sir. Good luck.
- Goodbye.

1632
01:44:13,053 --> 01:44:14,281
Goodbye, sir.

1633
01:44:14,454 --> 01:44:17,355
I hope I catch up with you
again one of these days.

1634
01:44:17,524 --> 01:44:19,492
I hope so, Lansing.

1635
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:24,021
Sir, when you get your new
assignment, I'd sure like to...

1636
01:44:24,197 --> 01:44:26,324
I'll see what I can do, George.

1637
01:44:29,936 --> 01:44:31,460
Sit down, Casey.

1638
01:44:31,638 --> 01:44:34,334
They reported my plane's ready.
Boys are loading my stuff.

1639
01:44:34,507 --> 01:44:36,338
oh, what's all the rush?

1640
01:44:36,509 --> 01:44:39,171
The orders said, "with
immediate effect," Cliff.

1641
01:44:39,345 --> 01:44:41,438
I'm taking Ted's personal things to Helen.

1642
01:44:41,614 --> 01:44:44,811
- Good. You'll go see her right away?
- of course.

1643
01:44:44,984 --> 01:44:49,011
You got any idea of what
they're going to do with you?

1644
01:44:50,657 --> 01:44:53,592
oh, I guess I still rate a training command.

1645
01:44:54,027 --> 01:44:56,086
I'd like to get one out west somewhere...

1646
01:44:56,262 --> 01:44:58,992
...where I could have
Kathy and the kids with me.

1647
01:44:59,165 --> 01:45:02,259
Get a day off now and
then, take the boy fishing.

1648
01:45:03,703 --> 01:45:04,897
Funny.

1649
01:45:05,071 --> 01:45:07,301
I was the boy that wanted
to fight the Japs...

1650
01:45:07,474 --> 01:45:09,772
...get that B-29 command.

1651
01:45:09,943 --> 01:45:11,410
I'm envying you already.

1652
01:45:11,578 --> 01:45:13,603
You've got a good job right here.

1653
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:16,476
- Good luck, Cliff.
- You can't run out on me like this.

1654
01:45:16,649 --> 01:45:18,617
What am I gonna do?

1655
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:23,551
You're going to command, Clifton, and
you'll be paid the first of every month.

1656
01:45:23,723 --> 01:45:24,917
I...

1657
01:45:25,091 --> 01:45:29,118
I had a boy in to see me tonight. A pilot.

1658
01:45:29,295 --> 01:45:31,388
Nice, attractive young
kid with a lot of guts.

1659
01:45:31,564 --> 01:45:33,725
They're all attractive
kids with a lot of guts.

1660
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:37,597
I know, but he gave me
a kind of personal slant.

1661
01:45:38,071 --> 01:45:40,665
There's no room in this job
for a personal slant, Cliff.

1662
01:45:41,574 --> 01:45:43,474
He told me he was going to be married.

1663
01:45:43,643 --> 01:45:44,905
Yes, I know.

1664
01:45:45,078 --> 01:45:48,377
You can only hope you don't
have to kill him before he does.

1665
01:45:49,149 --> 01:45:50,480
It's your baby, Cliff.

1666
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:53,517
I found out long ago to let
the chaplain handle those.

1667
01:45:53,686 --> 01:45:56,985
He's our liaison with
headquarters that decides that.

1668
01:45:57,157 --> 01:46:00,320
Casey, what's happened to you?

1669
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,427
The same thing that's going to happen to you.

1670
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:07,165
And the sooner I get out of here,
the sooner you'll get to work.

1671
01:46:07,333 --> 01:46:10,325
Yeah, but when you first came
over here, you had Ted to talk to.

1672
01:46:10,503 --> 01:46:13,028
- At least...
- Yes, I had Ted.

1673
01:46:13,206 --> 01:46:15,936
That's one thing I've done for you, Cliff.

1674
01:46:16,109 --> 01:46:17,974
I've killed Ted.

1675
01:46:18,144 --> 01:46:19,543
You won't have to do that.

1676
01:46:22,715 --> 01:46:25,240
Casey, you've hated this.

1677
01:46:25,819 --> 01:46:28,515
Every minute of it, haven't you?

1678
01:46:30,423 --> 01:46:32,721
oh, I've had worse commands.

1679
01:46:32,892 --> 01:46:35,053
You can be glad you
didn't have to run a group.

1680
01:46:35,228 --> 01:46:37,219
That is personal.

1681
01:46:37,797 --> 01:46:40,527
You see them at meals, and
you get to know a lot of them.

1682
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,827
It's rough enough when
you start counting in...

1683
01:46:43,002 --> 01:46:45,197
...the really bad ones you ordered yourself.

1684
01:46:47,173 --> 01:46:51,166
You'll find that you get their
faces all mixed up sometimes.

1685
01:46:51,477 --> 01:46:54,571
The kids just coming in on
the replacement trucks...

1686
01:46:54,747 --> 01:46:57,181
...and the ones you've already killed.

1687
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:02,688
But then when you start
feeling sorry for yourself...

1688
01:47:02,856 --> 01:47:05,324
...think of what they've got to go through.

1689
01:47:06,125 --> 01:47:08,787
There's only one thing you
can really do for them, Cliff.

1690
01:47:09,495 --> 01:47:11,793
Make every one of them count.

1691
01:47:11,965 --> 01:47:14,729
See that they're not used up for nothing.

1692
01:47:16,669 --> 01:47:20,298
Maybe you can keep their kid
brothers from coming over here.

1693
01:47:26,179 --> 01:47:27,942
Here's the list prepared for you, sir.

1694
01:47:28,114 --> 01:47:29,103
A list?

1695
01:47:29,282 --> 01:47:31,216
Yes, sir. You ordered it, sir.

1696
01:47:31,384 --> 01:47:32,817
Read it.

1697
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:37,989
"Expectancy of losses from flak against
naval targets at French channel ports.

1698
01:47:38,157 --> 01:47:41,092
Brest, 4.9, Cherbourg, 3.4...

1699
01:47:41,261 --> 01:47:44,321
...Calais, 2.2, Dunkirk, 1.6...

1700
01:47:44,497 --> 01:47:46,829
...Dieppe, 1.4... "
- That's enough.

1701
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:55,735
Earnie, how did my goodbye present
to the boys finally average out?

1702
01:47:55,909 --> 01:47:59,675
The losses were 24 percent
Friday, 26 percent yesterday...

1703
01:47:59,846 --> 01:48:02,178
...and 29 percent today, sir.

1704
01:48:03,416 --> 01:48:07,113
Quite a difference between those
and the channel ports, Casey, huh?

1705
01:48:08,087 --> 01:48:10,112
Many differences, Cliff.

1706
01:48:22,702 --> 01:48:24,169
Haley...

1707
01:48:24,637 --> 01:48:27,868
...notify the divisions and all our groups...

1708
01:48:28,041 --> 01:48:30,737
...that tomorrow, the 5th
division will attack Fendelhorst.

1709
01:48:31,444 --> 01:48:32,968
Yes, sir.

1710
01:48:43,256 --> 01:48:45,724
General, good luck.

1711
01:48:46,492 --> 01:48:49,484
Save me a job in that
training command, will you?

1712
01:48:52,765 --> 01:48:55,393
Change of orders for General Dennis, sir.

1713
01:48:55,568 --> 01:48:58,059
- oh, no, you don't.
- From Washington, sir.

1714
01:48:58,237 --> 01:49:00,364
I've got my orders. I've gone. Home.

1715
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,132
Sorry, sir. This is from the chief.

1716
01:49:02,308 --> 01:49:05,038
We're instructed to relay
the message to your plane.

1717
01:49:08,281 --> 01:49:11,717
"With immediate effect, General
Dennis will proceed via Gibraltar...

1718
01:49:11,884 --> 01:49:15,581
...Cairo, Karachi, Calcutta,
and Chongqing to... "

1719
01:49:15,989 --> 01:49:19,857
Casey, this is the biggest thing
that could happen to any of us.

1720
01:49:20,026 --> 01:49:22,756
It means a B-29 command.

1721
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:26,430
No. They can't.

1722
01:49:26,599 --> 01:49:28,464
They can't.

1723
01:49:37,844 --> 01:49:40,404
Cliff, does it say "with immediate effect"?

1724
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,775
I'm afraid it does, Casey.

1725
01:49:45,318 --> 01:49:48,412
Think you could fix Sergeant Evans
up with emergency travel orders?

1726
01:49:48,588 --> 01:49:50,886
I'll walk them through myself, sir.

1727
01:49:58,031 --> 01:49:59,862
General, all the best.

1728
01:50:00,033 --> 01:50:01,796
Thanks, Brockhurst.

1729
01:50:02,335 --> 01:50:04,633
- So long, Casey.
- So long, Cliff.

1730
01:50:04,804 --> 01:50:07,432
- Goodbye, Casey.
- Goodbye, Earnie.

1731
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:10,374
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, sergeant.

1732
01:50:25,591 --> 01:50:28,151
If the strike photos on
Fendelhorst are good tomorrow...

1733
01:50:28,327 --> 01:50:30,158
...why don't you send him one?

1734
01:50:30,463 --> 01:50:32,590
I already thought of that.

1735
01:51:29,722 --> 01:51:31,713
