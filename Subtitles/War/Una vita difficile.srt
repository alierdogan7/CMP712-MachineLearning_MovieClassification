1
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,194
Partisans!

2
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,755
Take the typewriter!

3
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,473
- My God! > Careful, Silvio!
- Who is it?

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,640
Do you remember it now,  mrs. Pavinato,
at the hotel "Leon d'oro"?

5
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,040
- Say the Tisico sent you.
- Goodbye and thanks. - Bye, Silvio.

6
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,077
Careful, the Germans are there.

7
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,192
Not there, the hotel is on the other side.

8
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,076
Attention, Germans coming.

9
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,550
- Heil, Hitler.
- Heil, Hitler.

10
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,118
Are you the landlady of the hotel?

11
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,916
Mother.

12
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,476
> Mother.

13
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,520
- Mrs. Pavinato?
- Yes, what do you want?

14
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,400
The Tisico sent me. You have a flour mill,
can you give me the keys?

15
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,960
- Why? - We are five,
in need of a secure shelter.

16
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,800
- Who are you? - I am Silvio,
the partisan journalist

17
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,960
writing for "La Scintilla".
I need your flour mill.

18
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
Move on! I don't want
anything to do with you.

19
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,280
- You have stolen salami from me.
- Be careful what you say.

20
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,440
I am no thief, I am an officer
and a university student.

21
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,200
I look like this because
I'm hunted for by the Germans.

22
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,880
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

23
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,640
For three nights I've been sleeping in a
cemetary, with a terrible toothache.

24
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,800
If it does not give the keys to me,
I'll break open the door!

25
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,760
I fight against the Germans
and I must be helped!

26
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,716
Is that the German?

27
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,796
Hands up!

28
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,400
- What's that? - A typewriter. I'm a writer.

29
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,111
- You're a partisan! - No, I'm a writer.
Artist. Novelist.

30
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,880
Madam, you speak German.
Help me, this will kill me.

31
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,440
You cannot kill me just like that,
you must prosecute me.

32
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,240
You don't deserve a legal process,
italian traitor!

33
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,199
- You've been firing at my German comrades.
- My God!

34
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,156
Oh.

35
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,838
You killed him with an iron?

36
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,076
Where are you going?

37
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,351
- Murderer, what have you done?
- It was her. - Elena?

38
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,236
What's going on?

39
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,360
In my room there is NO hot water.

40
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,318
Quick,
hot water for lieutenant Franz.

41
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,229
- Leave now.
- Where? - Now!

42
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,759
Come with me. Run!

43
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,717
- Are the Germans there?
- Go.

44
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,035
Where are you running? Here.

45
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,880
- What are you doing?
- Taking the keys.

46
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,080
- Whose house is it? - My grandfather's
flour mill. It's abandoned now.

47
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,880
- The Germans will not find you here.
- You're right. - Get inside.

48
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,836
Quick.

49
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,116
- Let's hide the machine gun.
- Yes, take it.

50
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,556
We'll put it here.

51
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,198
It's beautiful here, I like it.

52
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,355
- Thanks, you have saved my life.
- Eh!

53
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,669
What's up, do I scare you?

54
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,080
Are you a servant?
Do you work in that hotel?

55
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,755
What do you mean, servant.
I'm the landlady's daughter.

56
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,310
- You, who are you? What you do in life?
- I'm a student.

57
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,155
- Southerner?
- No, I'm from Rome.

58
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,312
- You're a Roman?
- Yes.

59
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,880
- How did you end up here?
- I was a second lieutenant in Como.

60
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
Then came the 8th of september,
my regiment was abandoned…

61
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,516
You're shaking. Are you cold? Afraid?

62
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,120
No, I have a neuralgia swelling
in my cheek, closing my eye.

63
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,399
I have many pains because of
the humidity. I also have a cough.

64
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,557
- You have bronchitis?
- Chronic bronchitis.

65
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,760
Do you have lice?

66
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
No, I'm clean,
I wash myself nearly every day.

67
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
This fabric is itching me,
it is mutton wool.

68
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,676
- Let's go.
- Eh?

69
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,271
- Let's go. - Where?
- Here!

70
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,920
You can rest here, then tonight
when it's dark you can move on.

71
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
- Whose bed is it?
- My grandfather's. - Beautiful!

72
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,160
- I haven't slept in a bed for four months.
- Where did you sleep?

73
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,080
Where we printed the newspapers,
under bridges, in cemetaries.

74
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,311
Every night we changed places,
to avoid being found by the the Germans.

75
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
Let me make the bed.

76
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,120
I'm distressed, because for three nights
I've been sleeping in a cemetary,

77
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,510
- in a tomb, next to a dead man.
- Holy Mother!

78
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,715
- Here, put yourself to bed.
- How nice! Tomorrow morning I will move on.

79
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,640
- Where will you go? - I'll catch up with
my companions, they need me.

80
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,160
I write the newspaper,
they are poor and unfortunate.

81
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,118
They are brave, but illiterate.

82
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,960
- Go to sleep now.

83
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,600
Afterwards I'll get you hot milk and an aspirin.

84
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,560
- Also get me a cigarette.
- Very well.

85
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
- What is your name?
- Elena.

86
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,636
- And you?
- Silvio.

87
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,999
Thanks, Elena, I will be grateful
to you for the rest of my life.

88
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,560
- What are you doing?
- I haven't seen a woman in months. Stay with me.

89
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,315
- No, I'm going to the hotel.
- Should I come also? - No.

90
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,199
I'll sleep now, and tomorrow
at dawn I will move on.

91
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,594
- Good bye.
- Close the door.

92
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,640
Radio newscast. From the Don
to the deserts of Africa, calmness reigns.

93
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,680
Also in the Three-Power Pact nations,
Christmas is celebrated.

94
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,640
The Führer has assured it will be
the last Christmas of war.

95
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Victory is sure.

96
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,518
- What a beautiful beard you have!
- Do you like it?

97
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,760
My grandparents slept
in this bed for 40 years.

98
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,833
- 40 years, always together?
- Yes, until they died.

99
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,756
Give me a cigarette.

100
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,639
Your mother, what does she say?
She knows we're together?

101
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,600
- No, she believes you are dead.
- Dead?

102
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
Everyone thinks you're dead,
even the Germans.

103
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,919
You've kept me here for three months.
My newspaper does not come out anymore.

104
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,312
It would be worse if I were dead.

105
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,274
- Do you hear steps? - Is it your mother?
- I don't know, I'll go see.

106
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,873
- Who is it?
- Your friends, the partisans.

107
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,400
- Look at that! Pippo, Lepre, the Vampiro.
- Which one is the Vampiro?

108
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,360
Look. All of my companions
who were with me. I'm going out.

109
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
- Where?
- I must go.

110
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,560
- You said you would leave tomorrow.
- You've held me here for three months.

111
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,640
- I want to call out to them.
- Let them go, they haven't seen you.

112
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Pinza, Pedro, Aquila!

113
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,800
- Close it, or you will catch bronchitis.
- They have gone.

114
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
How cold!
They are gone. And I, what do I do?

115
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,715
- You will go to bed. - To bed?
- Yes, you're cold.

116
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,640
- I should have gone with them.
- Why, don't you like it here with me?

117
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,596
No, I'm fine.

118
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,992
It's a shepherd's house,
but it is fine.

119
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,116
How is your house is Rome?

120
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,960
It is big, and has large window
facing the Tiber river.

121
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,910
- Shall we go and live there?
- Sure, if it hasn't been requisitioned.

122
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,720
- What will you do after the war?
- I'll be a journalist.

123
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,400
I will write. I already have a novel in mind.

124
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,391
Did you hear? Shooting.

125
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,271
They are my friends! It's Barbetta!
He makes the explosives.

126
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,476
They blew up the central.

127
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,148
And I'm here, in bed with you!
What a scoundrel!

128
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,640
- Hey, Vampiro!
- Who's there?

129
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,320
- Silvio.
- Where have you been?

130
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,880
I've been sick, with
bronchitis and other pains,

131
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,351
but an old woman has nursed and rescued me.
Now I'm coming with you.

132
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,520
She's been like a mother to me.
She has given me ham and salami.

133
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,320
If the old one awakens, she won't let me leave.
She's become too attached!

134
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
Flour! Let's go.

135
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
- How cold!
- You can feel the mountains!

136
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,720
- Who has typeset "The Americans out of Rome"?
- I have.

137
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,520
- Who gave you the order?
- Magnozzi. - Silvio.

138
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,480
- The article was "The Americans in Rome".
- It is better like that!

139
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,720
- Let me decide! - You have already twice
caused this newspaper to be stopped.

140
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,960
Simonini, don't worry about it,
let the director decide.

141
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,480
Yes? Speak, director.

142
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
You've read the article?

143
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,640
The title?
“The Americans out of Rome”.

144
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,350
No? More moderate?
I would kick them out personally.

145
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,720
I hear you director.
I do not have a sense of realities?

146
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,440
I must "keep my feet on the ground”?

147
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,840
At times I can't control myself.
When… You want Simonini?

148
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,991
Right away. Simonini,
the director wants to talk to you.

149
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,840
- Hello? I'm starving already!
- That's not true.

150
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,436
No, no. The Dongo gold?
They found it in Lake Como?

151
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,080
- Very well. I must leave straight away?
- Tell him I'm coming with you.

152
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,036
I'll take Magnozzi with me.

153
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,320
- No? - I know the places,
I was a partisan.

154
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,440
- He knows the area,
he was a partisan. - Sure!

155
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,431
Very well.

156
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,040
- What did he say?
- He said yes.

157
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,235
- When do we leave?
- Immediately.

158
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
- I said "immediately".
- Yes.

159
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,837
“The Americans in Rome”, then.
The director is sending me to the Dongo.

160
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,680
7 months after the end of the war,

161
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,400
we are here, where tragedies of
war and fascism took place.

162
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,240
The search for the famous treasure
of the Dongo has been futile.

163
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,400
and the journalists are returning
to their quarters.

164
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,190
Get away! It may blow up!

165
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,516
- Get us water!
- Water!

166
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,000
On that mountain there is a flour mill

167
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,720
where I spent a wonderful time
with a woman. A beautiful woman.

168
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,792
See that village? She lives there.

169
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,320
- The one who killed a German with an iron? - Yes.

170
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,560
Over there is her hotel.

171
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,560
- How do we get there?
- With the ferry, takes ten minutes.

172
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,920
- Does she have any sisters?
- One, a little one.

173
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,600
Let's go there, we'll eat, sleep for free
and pass a beautiful evening.

174
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,160
I cannot go to her.

175
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
I promised to marry her,
take her to Rome.

176
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
Instead one night I ran away
while she was sleeping.

177
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,160
I have never sent her
a single postcard.

178
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,359
Hello? Hotel Leon d' Oro?
Miss Elena?

179
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,480
- You're not her? - You're her mother?
- Her sister. - Give it to me.

180
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,358
Hello, Iris? This is Silvio.

181
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,800
Yes, I'm alive.

182
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,880
- Don't get your mother, get Elena.
- How many years is she?

183
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,280
- She was 13 years. - So now she's
about 15. Let's go there. - No! Shut up!

184
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,960
Hello, Elena?
My love! No, I'm not dead.

185
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,040
I'm a few kilometres from you.

186
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,474
What are you doing, love, are you crying?

187
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,880
It's too emotional for her, she cannot speak.

188
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,920
- How I like that! - If her sister is
too young, she can bring a friend.

189
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,240
Hello, Elena?

190
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,720
Speak, tell me something!

191
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,235
Two cases of beer? What are you saying?

192
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,400
Her mother is there, she doesn't want her to
understand she is talking to me.

193
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,840
- Why I haven't written? Well…
- “I will explain it all to you later”.

194
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,800
- I will explain everything. - “We'll be
out late". -Leave me alone!

195
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,480
I wasn't talking to you. I'm not alone here.
Let me speak!

196
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,200
You have no idea what has happened!
I will tell you all about it when we meet.

197
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
- “We'll be until late.”
- Yes!

198
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,080
I never graduated,
I started as a journalist.

199
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,560
I've come from Rome with the purpose of seeing you.

200
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,040
I so much want to see you again, my love.

201
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,680
No, we came by car.
She asks what kind of car.

202
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,636
You will see it afterwards.

203
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,040
I'm coming at once. I'm taking the ferry,
we'll meet at the landing.

204
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,040
- Tell her to bring a friend.
- Ok, I'll tell her!

205
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,840
Elena, do you have a friend?

206
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,234
Bring a friend. I'm here
with a journalist, a colleague.

207
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,840
A very likeable one.
Listen to what I'm saying.

208
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,360
If you don't mind we'll go out with him.

209
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,880
We'll go dancing, have a good time.

210
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,640
- “And be out until late”.
- Be quiet!

211
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,714
Elena, we'll see each other in a short while.
At the landing.

212
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,550
She said she had married.
She thought I was dead.

213
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,196
- So they're not coming?
- Yes, she's coming.

214
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,073
- Silvio, look at that mountain dweller.
- It's her!

215
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,393
- And the other one?
- Elena!

216
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,434
- The friend.
- I don't know.

217
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Elena!

218
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,520
- You have cut your beard?
- Yes, don't you like it?

219
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,637
It was the only beautiful thing you had.
Now you seem a different person.

220
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,830
Good evening, I'm Simonini, a colleague.
Why are you coming alone?

221
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,880
- Why, with whom should I have come?
- I didn't want him to be single tonight.

222
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,680
- I wanted us to pass this beautiful evening.
- Together.

223
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,160
- I have come only to bring you your stuff. - Well.

224
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,800
- The typewriter,
the washed linen. - She has washed it.

225
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,200
You left it all the flour mill
when you fled.

226
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,040
- I left to do what I had to do.
- Good luck on your career.

227
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,076
I hope never to see you again.

228
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,360
- What did I do?
- You're losing her. A character like her!

229
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,280
- Hold this.
- Go there.

230
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,431
Elena! Wait!

231
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,040
Why did you do that?

232
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,280
Is it true that you married?
Why didn't you wait for me?

233
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,431
Bastard! You can't do like that!

234
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,920
I killed a man to save your life,

235
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,480
we lived together for three months
and then you fled.

236
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,040
I realize I have done wrong.

237
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,200
How many promises you made me,
and how many beautiful words you said to me!

238
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,920
You even wrote me poems!

239
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,240
You said you couldn't live without me,

240
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,200
that I was more necessary to you
than bread and water.

241
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,120
And now you phone me up, two years later,
to pass a beautiful evening!

242
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,998
Here's the beautiful evening!

243
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,600
Elena.

244
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,480
I have been a bastard, but I will not
allow you to marry another man.

245
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,200
- Who will stop me?
- I will.

246
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,520
- It's too late.
- No.

247
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,280
- How beautiful you are! Give me a kiss.
- No.

248
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,440
Let's go to the flour mill, we'll spend
a beautiful night together.

249
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Then, if you want, you can come to Rome with me.

250
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,160
I won't go to the flour mill,
you will leave me there again!

251
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,553
No, I have come here to tell
you how much I love you.

252
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,240
If you really love me,
do you know what to do?

253
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm coming with you.
But not to the flour mill, to Rome!

254
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,840
To Rome? When?

255
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
At once.

256
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,160
- Will your mother agree with this?
- No. - And then?

257
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,913
I'll flee. Iris!

258
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,600
I told you he would take
me with him to Rome.

259
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,880
- Here is Elena's suitcase.
- Good.

260
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,680
- Tell mother we love each other.
- And your fiancèe?

261
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,629
- He and his millions can go to hell!
- Yes.

262
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,876
- Bye, lris.
- Bye.

263
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,988
- Good bye, Silvio.
- Bye, lris.

264
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,552
Let's go.

265
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,110
- The boat is leaving!
- One moment, we're coming.

266
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,916
Silvio, quick!

267
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,160
- What are you doing with that suitcase?
- Elena is coming to Rome with me.

268
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,880
- Are you crazy?
- Not, sooner or later I had to do it.

269
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,351
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I have decided and am happy with it.

270
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,191
What does it matter to you?

271
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,316
I'll take it.

272
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,310
Let's go. Elena.

273
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,600
- Bye.
- The car isn't yours?

274
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,639
No, it belongs to the newspaper.
Bow down, duck your head.

275
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,756
Come.

276
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,597
- Welcome!
- Dear Biancona.

277
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,676
Come on, Elena.

278
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,075
Excuse me, my love. Allow me.

279
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,908
Please enter.

280
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,076
Help yourself inside.

281
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,996
Put down the suitcase, make yourself comfortable.

282
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,835
- Where's the kitchen? - There isn't one,
I have always eaten in the trattoria.

283
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,317
Well, do you like it?

284
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,150
Would you rather return to your mother's house?

285
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,555
No.

286
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,313
- Silvio. - Hi, Elena,
wait for me, I coming right away.

287
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,600
- Director, have a look at this title.
- Very good.

288
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,480
- Should we add “The king is out”? - No,
let the constituents say that.

289
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,000
- Very well. Excuse me, but can you give me
an advance payment? - Another one?

290
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,080
We are two, now.

291
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,080
I know, but you have to think.
I cannot help you anymore.

292
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,440
The trattoria won't give us any more to eat.
Give me just 10,000 liras.

293
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,840
- Our newspaper is not financed
by billionaires. - I know.

294
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,120
We make do with money from laborers.
We should be content.

295
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,120
But some of us cash in 30,000 liras per month.

296
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,040
- There are those who are worth more, and those less.
- Then I am worth the least of all.

297
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,560
No, if things go well,
even you will live better.

298
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,840
Very well, give me 5.000.

299
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,080
I can give you this.
It's a bill of exchange worth 60.000 Liras.

300
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,760
- I can give it to the trattoria.
- Try it.

301
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,960
- Thanks. No “The king is out” then?
- Go.

302
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,273
- Elena, Let's go for a meal. I have a
bill of exchange. - Is it valid? - He said so.

303
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,915
Bye.

304
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:41,440
- The royal family has to leave.
- Is it the king's fault?

305
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,600
No, it is Badoglio
and all the other traitors fault that…

306
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,680
- Excuse me,  where were you
on the eight of september? - How so?

307
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,720
- Where were you on the eight of september?
- What do you want? Who are you?

308
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,760
- Silvio, let's go.
- Yes, we'd better.

309
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,880
- You're a fascist.
- Bye, beautiful!*

310
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,400
- Don't always argue!
- Now that we are free, they want them back?

311
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,628
I'm hungry!

312
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,269
- The first results of the referendum!
- Good evening, mrs. Gina.

313
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,560
Let's see.

314
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,400
Hello.

315
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,240
Bologna, Reggio Emilia, Ferrara
and Modena seem good.

316
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,000
- The middle regions? - So so.
The final results will be out in two hours.

317
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,470
- You are already eating?
- Yes, I'm having lamb.

318
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,200
- How nice.
- Do you want lamb?

319
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,476
No, I prefer the beefsteak.
Waiter.

320
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,360
Two fettuccine with gravy and two beefsteaks.
I'll have an egg on top of mine.

321
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,800
- On mine too.
- And two salads. - Very well.

322
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,760
Ask Giovanni if his father
has sent him the small cookies.

323
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,440
- You've never had them with red wine?
- No. - They're the best.

324
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,318
- Where you have eaten today?
- Today, nothing.

325
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,160
- We've been to bed all day.
- And yesterday evening?

326
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,800
- Elena didn't feel so good.
- It is not true, we don't have a single lira.

327
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,560
- Haven't they paid you?
- A bill of exchange.

328
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,950
- A bill of exchange? - What is it?
- Giovanni sent it to you.

329
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,393
- What? - What is it?
- The bill.

330
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,360
Giovanni. How are you?

331
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,040
Mrs. Gina looks good,
she has lost weight. How is your father?

332
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,360
- He is fine, but I'm not together with you.
- Why? What is this?

333
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,120
- The bill. - Good?
- Why “good”?

334
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,040
Today is ours! We are winning,
Italy is becoming a republic!

335
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,669
January and February: 30,000 Liras.

336
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,120
April and May: 20.000.
To balance, you must give me 50,000 liras.

337
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,000
50,000 liras just to to eat!
I'm happy to spend them, I eat well here.

338
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,600
Here are 60,000 liras,
give me back the balance of 10,000 liras.

339
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,520
- I'm giving you nothing.
- Why? It is signed by Franchetti.

340
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,595
- He is hungrier than you!
- I understand. Franco, please come here!

341
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,678
Excuse me.

342
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,640
- Giovanni does not recognize Franchetti's signature.
Can you verify it for him. - Sure.

343
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,120
No, you owe me even more than he does.

344
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,320
I have already told you,
it is the last time you eat here.

345
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,400
- In what sense? - You understood me.
- But we have sent you many customers!

346
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,280
I have sent them all out
because they didn't pay.

347
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,120
- Giovanni, what has happened? - Before you
came alone, now you also bring your friend along.

348
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,960
- She's my woman. - That's not important,
you're not eating here anymore!

349
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,720
- Franco, here we cannot eat anymore.
- You're not allowed to come!

350
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,440
- Very well, but don't offend him afterwards.
- No.

351
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,910
- Come on, I'm joking!
- I'm not.

352
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,230
- Silvio, are we eating or leaving?
- Wait a little, then we're leaving.

353
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm leaving, but at least give her a beefsteak,
she hasn't eaten in three days.

354
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,240
- No! You're not eating!
- Let it be.

355
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,840
Go to Assassino at the corner,
and put it on my account.

356
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,277
Very well.
Elena, we're going to Assassino.

357
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,520
- Good evening.
- Bye. - Good evening, mrs. Gina.

358
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,275
- Bye, see you at the the newspaper.
- Good appetite.

359
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,989
- You exaggerated, they're offended.
- So what!

360
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,274
The first results of the referendum!
Republic or monarchy!

361
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,911
Elena, wait here, I'll call for you.

362
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,908
Good evening, is this the Assassino?

363
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,196
Elena!

364
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,840
- My darling! - Marquis Capperoni,
how good to see you!

365
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,480
- Did you know I was living in Rome?
- Yes, your mother told me.

366
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,640
- Did she tell you I ran away from home?
- Yes, she will never forgive you.

367
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,560
But you did right in
following the man you love.

368
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,840
- You love him, right?
- Yes, a lot.

369
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,120
- You are married?
- Not yet, but we will be soon.

370
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,760
- What does he do?
- He's a journalist and a writer.

371
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,720
- Fantastic! A promising line of work!
- I have a lot of confidence in him.

372
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,920
- If you see my mother, tell her we are very happy.
- Sure.

373
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:00,720
- Simonini told me so.
- If I see him I 'll kick him in the butt.

374
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm very pleased to have seen you again.

375
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,640
So many memories! My beloved child!

376
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,000
- Who is this?
- Silvio, this is marquis Capperoni,

377
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,040
- He used to stay at our hotel during holidays.
- It's him!

378
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,160
- Magnozzi.
- I'm very pleased. - The pleasure is mine.

379
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,120
- Have you eaten already?
- Did you say we had eaten already?

380
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,120
- Not, we were going to the trattoria.
- Then you must come with me.

381
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,200
- Where?
- To Rustichelli.

382
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,080
While we eat, we will know
the results of the referendum.

383
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,640
I don't know… We are not dressed well.

384
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,080
You're a writer, you artists have no
obligation to be elegant.

385
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,200
- Shall we go. - Is he monarchic?
- Even the monarchic eat, don't they?

386
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,995
- Well… Rustichelli…
- Come on.

387
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,160
- What are the news?
- Naples is good, mother.

388
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,040
- And Piemonte? Pinerolo?
- We are winning everywhere.

389
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,591
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm only anxious for the king.

390
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,960
- Who is this young man?
- Magnozzi, a talented writer and journalist.

391
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,916
Be seated.

392
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,680
Why do you bring people I don't know to the house?

393
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,437
- Mother, we were 13 at the table.
- Ah, we cannot be 13 at the table.

394
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,276
What anxiety!

395
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,435
- They were 13.
- I heard.

396
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,115
What a time for His Majesty!

397
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,040
I will always remember the last time
I met His Majesty.

398
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,040
I was in Pinerolo, about to leave
for the front with my division.

399
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,080
His Majesty had come to salute us,

400
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:24,160
and when we were about to leave,
he turned quickly,

401
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,040
came towards me, took my
hand and said in a low voice:

402
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,840
“Dear Rustichelli,
you have no idea how much I envy you.“

403
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,360
There was a sincerity in his words,

404
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,280
which brought tears to my eyes.

405
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,794
Even now, honestly,

406
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,469
I get emotional

407
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,680
just talking about it.

408
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,960
- Why? Why?
- Why what?

409
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,114
Why do many people
want bad for the king? Why?

410
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,160
- They accuse him of having gone to the South.
- They accuse him of running away?

411
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
- No… - I said “gone”, not "run away”.

412
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,675
You said “gone”, but this gesture
says “run away”.

413
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,880
It's the same thing. Why didn't he go
north to fight with the partisans?

414
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,880
But he was 70 years,
he was small and sick.

415
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,320
- Who speaks of the partisans?
- I do. - They are gangsters!

416
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,080
- Bravo!
- Don't laugh beneath your moustaches.

417
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,915
- Shall we talk seriously about it?
- Silvio, we are here to eat.

418
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,316
Just one for me.

419
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,356
The lady.

420
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,440
I'll serve him. We're used to that at home.

421
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,151
Fantastic.

422
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,991
- Rolls?
- Yes.

423
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,874
- What are they doing?
- They are eating half the pasticcio.*

424
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,316
I don't want…

425
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,956
Thanks.

426
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,320
Attention.
This is the official announcement

427
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,120
of the results of the public referendum
on monarchy-republic.

428
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,076
What are you doing, eating?

429
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,836
No?

430
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,560
Monarchy:
10 million and 709.423 votes.

431
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,320
- Good.
- We have won!

432
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,276
Very good!

433
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,630
Republic:
12 million and 718.019 votes.

434
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,120
As of today, Italy is a republic.

435
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,440
- My God!
- Mother doesn't feel well.

436
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,396
Come.

437
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,677
Let's go, general.

438
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,798
Let's go, Massimiliano.

439
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,516
Don't cry, dad.
Come here, your Excellency.

440
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,513
There is also someone laughing!

441
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,315
- Who has the courage to laugh?
Long live the king! - Live!

442
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,317
- Gangsters.
- Come, darling.

443
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,000
What do we do, should we leave?

444
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,232
- Let's eat first, and then leave.
- Good, we eat.

445
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,037
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

446
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,833
- To your health.
- To yours.

447
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,236
Tasty!

448
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,678
- Also the greyhounds, Mrs.?
- No,only the dachs are going to Switzerland.

449
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,592
- I have an appointment with the Commander.
- Make yourself comfortable, he's waiting for you.

450
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,320
I'm happy to make your aquaintance,
and thanks for accepting my invitation.

451
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,800
- Good morning. - My lawyer.
We can speak freely.

452
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,756
Happy to make your aquaintance.

453
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,355
I thought you were older.

454
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,760
- I have your article here. It ends
with these words. > Give me Zürich.

455
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
Do you want a Cinzano?

456
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,720
“In the next article we will give names
of some industrialists,

457
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
who because of political elections,

458
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,640
have covertly sent tens
of billions abroad. “

459
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,760
I would like to know if my name is one of them.

460
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,040
Since you have made me come here,
you know your name is there.

461
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,272
Do you believe you have proof of
this absurd denunciation?

462
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,240
Since I have decided to involve you,
and persons much higher up than you,

463
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,516
I can say I'm sure of what I'm doing.

464
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,000
- Magnozzi, I dont fear you.
- I know you have no fear.

465
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,480
I have made you come to avoid
the nuisance of it.

466
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,520
I don't like scandals, and I want
the article to not become published.

467
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,760
- We should be able to find an agreement.
- What are you intending to say?

468
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,030
You're an intellectual, a bourgeois like me,
therefore we will find an agreement.

469
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,280
- How much are you paid for these articles?
- 5,000 Liras.

470
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,560
We will not be able to find an agreement,
even if you should offer me 50,000 liras.

471
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,395
I'm not offering you 50,000 liras,
but 5 million.

472
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,160
- How much are you paid per month?
- By who?

473
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,440
- Your wage.
- 30.000.

474
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,398
- How can you live on 30.000 Liras?
- Badly.

475
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,600
I offer you 300,000 liras.

476
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,840
You cannot refuse, besides the industry
owns the newspapers.

477
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,600
With me, you can have a shining and secure future.

478
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,520
- Are you married?
- Not legally. I live with someone.

479
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,229
- Any children?
- No, fortunately.

480
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,600
- One is coming though.
- My compliments!

481
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:41,400
Then I offer you two hectares of commercial building ground, registered to your son's name.

482
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,997
In ten years the property will be worth a lot, and your son will be rich.

483
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,636
Magnozzi!

484
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,195
We interrupt this silence, this
muteness with open eyes.

485
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,440
- Do you want cars, apartments,
furs? - Never mind that!

486
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,080
For three years I have worn the same cork shoes.

487
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,960
Be sincere with me.
I know I don't have to accept,

488
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,800
- But I want to know what you think.
- Why can't you accept?

489
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,120
You still haven't understood?
We've lived together for three years.

490
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,640
Be careful, remember 
those are powerful people.

491
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,680
Now they escape to Switzerland,
but if they win the elections,

492
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,840
they will return and seek revenge.
- Even if they do, I have nothing to lose.

493
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,000
You're irresponsible! Have you forgotten
we're about to have a child?

494
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,160
The child! You are giving me
aversions before he's even born.

495
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,550
Before making a decision,
you must think of him!

496
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,640
I love children, but if a child forces me

497
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,360
to commit actions contrary to my ideas,

498
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,560
then I don't want it.
It is better not to do it.

499
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,520
- What are you saying? - If you were
more educated and modern,

500
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,120
you would know that there are countries
like Sweden and Finland

501
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,908
where if a woman who cannot take 
care of her child, do you know what they do?

502
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,680
She can choose not to have it.
And the law is on her side.

503
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,120
If you continue with these speeches,
I will break this bottle on your head.

504
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,880
- You haven't understood.
- I understood very well!

505
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:47,360
If you want to ruin mine and my child's life,
do as you want. Good night.

506
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,352
- Elena!
- I'm going to sleep.

507
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,518
Silvio! What are you doing?

508
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,080
I've been thinking all night,
and I have decided to do it my way.

509
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,390
I have called the newspaper,
and told them to publish the article.

510
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,632
They will remember it
for the rest of their life!

511
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,000
Silvio Magnozzi is sentenced
to 11 months of jail

512
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,800
for libel.

513
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,040
Not having a criminal record,
the sentence is made suspended.

514
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,999
- Thanks, lawyer.
- Silvio! - Take it easy!

515
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,396
My love.

516
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,560
Thanks, colleagues.
Don't push, she is pregnant.

517
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,269
The witnesses have betrayed me
because they accepted the millions.

518
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,593
In the name of the law I declare you
legally wed. Your signatures.

519
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,640
- We were in for five minutes, and now we're man and wife.
- If it's that easy, I'll do it too.

520
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,080
- Are you leaving right away?
- Yes. - Where are you going to?

521
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,200
We're traveling up north.

522
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,840
- You're meeting your mother-in-law?
- No, Elena has no relationship with her mother.

523
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,638
- What's that?
- What is happening?

524
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,316
What has happened?

525
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,440
What is it?

526
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,000
- Where are you running?
- They have shot Togliatti.

527
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,878
- It's the revolution. Run!
- Silvio!

528
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,914
- Come here! - Elena,
go back home and lock the door.

529
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,240
Cignetti Enrico is sentenced
to 1 year and 4 months of confinement

530
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,120
for public disturbance.

531
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,160
Magnozzi Silvio, for having participated in riots,

532
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,000
for having attempted to occupy a radio station,

533
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,280
is sentenced to 1 year and 3 months of confinement.

534
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,000
In accordance with article 168 of the Penal Code,
we revoke the benefit

535
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,160
of a suspended sentence from the previous sentence,

536
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,188
therefore the defendant will serve
2 years and 2 months of confinement.

537
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,597
- Silvio.
- Elena.

538
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,080
- Hello, Elena!
Did you have a nice journey? - Yes.

539
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,198
- There is mother.
- How you've grown.

540
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,076
Mother!

541
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,677
What a shame,
all of the country is talking about you.

542
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,633
- Hello, Elena.
- Hello, uncle, how are you?

543
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,913
Let's go home, we're not entertaining people.

544
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,240
Don't lose hope.
God's house is big.

545
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,480
Jail will do good for your Silvio.

546
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,075
I'm sure it will “put his head in place”.

547
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,638
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

548
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,917
Hush!

549
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,120
The director wants to hear
your requests.

550
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,749
If he finds them reasonable,
they may be granted.

551
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,356
- Who are your representatives?
- We are. - Come forward.

552
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,920
- You organized the uprising?
- Yes. Myself, him and the committee.

553
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,520
- What is your name?
- Magnozzi Silvio.

554
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,680
- I'm a journalist and political prisoner.
- And you?

555
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,160
Grisaglia Gino, called Ragana,
owner of a night club.

556
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,720
- Are you also political?
- No, cocaine.

557
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,439
- What are your demands?
- One moment.

558
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:18,398
“A study room with new books,
the prisoners want to educate themselves.

559
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,640
Respect for prison regulations,
or we will begin a hunger strike.

560
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,596
Then we ask… “

561
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,760
“Dear wife, the prisoners have
gotten all I asked for,

562
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,200
and I am in solitary confinement, on bread
and water for three weeks.

563
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,720
I have started writing the novel,
I wanted to do so for years. “

564
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,440
“Dear Silvio,
our child has been born.

565
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,480
Weight 3 kilos, and everyone says he looks like you.

566
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,160
I will call him Paulo, after my grandfather,
the master of the old flour mill.

567
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,920
I'm certain your novel
will be a masterpiece,

568
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,360
but mother says you should
study for your degree.

569
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,796
Here on the mountains it's been
snowing for two days. “

570
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,160
“Dear Elena, you have christened
the child and called him Paulo.

571
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,160
I am not against it, but you could
have asked my opinion.

572
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,240
Yesterday a minister paid visit to us.

573
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,720
There was some noise, and I am
back in solitary confinement.

574
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,480
The novel is proceeding well,
I'd like to call it “A difficult life”.

575
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,160
What do you think of it?

576
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,320
I desire your mouth,
your caresses, your kisses.

577
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,356
I dream of you all through the nights.“

578
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,800
“Silvio, I know you desire me,
but don't write so in your letters,

579
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,680
because my mother reads them,
and then I feel ashamed.

580
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,080
I have sent you books
about architecture.

581
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,880
Let the novel rest, and study.

582
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,360
If you graduate, mother has found a position
for you in Cantù Cermenate.

583
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,200
Yesterday the child got his first tooth.

584
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,952
Here by the lake it continues to pour down. “

585
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,951
- Here I am!
- Ugly disgrace!

586
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,796
< Goodbye and thanks.

587
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,237
There is daddy. Do you see?

588
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,800
Is it Paolino?

589
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,720
My son! Look at him!

590
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,640
You've become a man! So beautiful!

591
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,920
- Do you look like me? You look like your daddy!
- Silvio.

592
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,876
My Elena!

593
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,800
- See who it is. - It's Simonini.
Look at that car.

594
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,032
Silvio! Elena! How been?

595
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,360
Such a beautiful child!
I've come to take you in my car.

596
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,640
Give uncle a kiss.

597
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,120
- Are you angry with me?
- We haven't seen each other for two years.

598
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,480
The last time was in the City Hall.

599
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,280
We had to occupy the RAI.

600
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,360
- They arrested me. Where were you?
- I had gone to take a cappuccino.

601
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,040
- There is a revolution and go for
a cappuccino! - Don't quarrel.

602
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,440
It wasn't like that.
Let me explain it to you.

603
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,880
That's not necessary, you left the workers
and joined the bosses.

604
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,840
The same bosses who sent me to jail.

605
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,360
He took all that I refused.
The wage, the car…

606
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,240
- And there's the dancer from Macario.
- You know her?

607
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,680
- It's Nadia, right?
- Yes. - You disgust me!

608
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,800
- But…  - You must understand,
he is just out of jail, he is exasperated.

609
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,440
- I want you well, I want to help you.
- I don't want your help.

610
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,640
- I'm going to my newspaper.
- And start over like before? - Yes. - Goodbye!

611
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,430
Elena is not a Macario dancer,
if she must skip a meal, she will.

612
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:02,800
- Come and have lunch with me.
- No, I have already eaten.

613
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,640
Don't pull! The child!

614
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,960
Elena doesn't need to go in a car,

615
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,760
- she's from the mountains, 
she like to walk. - Then walk!

616
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,716
Yes, I walk.

617
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,639
- Watch out.
- Phone me.

618
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,160
I spend two years in jail for serving
this newspaper in an honest way

619
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,600
and you tell me I no longer have a job here?

620
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,960
Unfortunately, things haven't gone too well,

621
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,280
your job doesn't exist anymore.

622
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:44,200
Director, dear colleagues,
I didn't expect this betrayal.

623
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,680
Even worse for me is, I have always believed in us.

624
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,800
I'm sorry, but since you react
like that, I must tell you the truth.

625
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,080
- Which is?
- Your wife and your mother-in-law pleaded me

626
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,920
- not to take you back at the newspaper.
- They did this?

627
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,520
Now you have a son, and the wage
here is always the same.

628
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,480
- Then what should I do?
- Study. Your mother-in-law will help you.

629
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,080
With a degree you will have a less
brilliant future, but more secure.

630
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,160
Thanks, is that the reason?

631
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,951
Then tomorrow at 8, I will be at my desk.
I'll show my wife that degree!

632
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,960
I'm the lady on the floor below.

633
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:34,120
Please, make your son turn off that music.

634
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,000
My husband is studying,
he must take a degree.

635
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,788
At least make him change that record.

636
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,918
What you want? Get out!

637
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,234
Paolino, leave dad alone.

638
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,280
< Your father must study!

639
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,431
- Don't do that to your mother!

640
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,360
Elena! Don't hit the child!

641
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,960
- How can I study like this?
- We have only one room!

642
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,035
Don't cry, you know your dad
must study for his degree.

643
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,880
- My love! Elena, he's ill!
- What?

644
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,750
- He's burning, that is why he cried.
- He has a fever. Phone the doctor.

645
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,954
They said on the radio that Stalin is dead.

646
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,478
- Can I take out the thermometer?
- Yes.

647
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,360
- 37,4.
- He's happy, right?

648
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,760
- His fever is gone. - The crisis
is over - Yes, it is over.

649
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,716
You are well!

650
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,760
- Don't inject him.
- And what did the doctor say?

651
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,560
- He has made it through.
- Yes, he is well now.

652
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,880
- We won't torture him any more.
- Yes.

653
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,031
- Sister, who is dead?
- Stalin.

654
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,080
- He is much better.
- Really?

655
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,153
- Mama's love.
- He is well. He has recovered.

656
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,080
He's through the crisis.
Is it true Stalin is dead?

657
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,640
Yes. Mother is here.

658
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:54,240
Granny's child. How are you?

659
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:59,680
You gave me a real scare.
I brought you a nice gift, a tricycle.

660
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,990
Are you happy grandmother has come?

661
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,709
- Silvio.
- Mother.

662
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,200
Give me a kiss.

663
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,430
Dear mother!

664
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,320
The historians will say he was a cruel dictator,

665
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,520
but an epoch is closely tied
to his name

666
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,080
and nobody can yet say which
crises may be triggered by his death.

667
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,390
The radio newscast is finished.

668
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,000
< ...always thinking about the newspapers,
about politics.

669
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,720
< it will never change.  - As soon as he finishes
the degree, we'll take him out of Rome.

670
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,880
< You will move to Cantù Cermenate,
marry in church,

671
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,640
and your priest uncle will consider
giving him a steady job.

672
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,040
< One day you will come out to the
countryside in a beautiful automobile.

673
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,828
< Everyone will see, my daughter
didn't marry a beggar.

674
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,520
- You were eavesdropping? - Yes.
- You heard everything? - Yes.

675
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,478
Do you agree with my plans?

676
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,559
Because of my love for Elena,
I'll accept any imposition,

677
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,040
- but where do you want me to live?
In Cantù Cermenate? - Yes.

678
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,760
- I'm supposed to go from Rome to Cantù
Cermenate? - Is that so strange?

679
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,280
- You romans make mistakes.
- No.

680
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,033
- Don't be so arrogant.
- Very well.

681
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:42,400
Attention. The examinations continue
with the letter M.

682
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,080
- Magnozzi Silvio.
- Here! - It's my turn?

683
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:52,440
- Don't be nervous.
- Go, I've been praying all morning for you.

684
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,920
- We'll wait here for you.
- Silvio, the marsala!

685
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,876
“In the mouth of the wolf”.

686
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,151
In what mood are the professors?

687
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,516
Good morning, professors.

688
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,634
Why aren't you shaved?

689
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,640
I have studied all night.

690
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,360
It is not necessary with a beard to
demonstrate that you have studied.

691
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,400
Such excuses will not
bring you a second chance.

692
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,758
Excuse me, but it's been 12 years
in which I didn't attend university.

693
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,872
We'll start with an easy question.

694
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:50,113
What is the safety coefficient
for precompressed concrete?

695
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,840
0.245.

696
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,155
145.

697
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,672
Safety coefficient for precompressed concrete.

698
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,672
There is a 5.

699
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,476
I'm sure there is.

700
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,871
- There is?
- Young man, you must not guess.

701
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,918
- Sit down.
- Yes.

702
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,510
Maybe I'll think better. Thanks.

703
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,275
So?

704
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,640
I don't know.

705
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,560
- If it don't answer these questions…
- Make me a simpler one.

706
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,031
- That is a simple question.
- It is simple.

707
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,073
They made me drink a marsala.
It has made me feel bad.

708
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,796
I feel numb.

709
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,520
I don't remember anything.

710
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,717
- How old are you?
- 33.

711
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,960
How come you are this delayed?

712
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,640
I've been in the war, in the resistance,
suffered a frozen finger.

713
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,800
After that I was in journalism,

714
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:58,840
passionately engaged in social
problems, problems of southern Italy,

715
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,560
also I was a follower of the fighing peasants.

716
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,394
The Resistance does not have any value here.

717
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,400
The Resistance does not have value?
Then what was I supposed to do?

718
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,280
What the others did in 1944?

719
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,320
Wear the uniform
of the Black Brigades,

720
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,040
and get my degree by aiming
a gun at the professors?

721
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,431
Don't make these gestures and don't raise
your voice, or I'll through you out!

722
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,600
Outside, my wife and my
mother-in-law are waiting for me.

723
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,556
And then?

724
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,679
Please, don't let me make such a bad impression.

725
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,397
- Be seated.
- Thanks.

726
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,920
Do you see that drawing?

727
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,360
Calculate at point A the momentary
forces on a supported beam

728
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,036
with a moving overload
in points 1, 2, 3 on the X-Y path.

729
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:07,194
I have understood.
Thanks of your kindness.

730
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,316
How did it go?

731
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,195
- Marenghi Elvira.
- Here I am.

732
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,358
What time is it?

733
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,198
3 o'clock.

734
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,840
- Hello?
- Elena, I flunked at my exam.

735
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,880
- I know. Where are you?
- At the Cangaceiro.

736
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,160
- What is that?
- You don't know what the Cangaceiro is?

737
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,994
Ignorant! It's my friend Ragana's night club.

738
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,158
What I'm doing?
Dancing a samba and a rumba.

739
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,880
- He's drunk.
- Tell him to come home immediately.

740
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:27,400
- Darling, I flunked. - That's not important,
come home, we're waiting for to you.

741
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,600
I'm not coming home. I am happy,
tell that to mother also.

742
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,040
You wanted to send me to Cantù Cermenate,
but since they flunked me,

743
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,280
I'm staying in Rome,
and I won't come home anymore.

744
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,670
They flunked me,
I no longer have to go to Cantù Cermenate.

745
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,391
- He stays there.
- What is this Cangaceiro?

746
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,868
It is a nightspot.

747
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,516
Wait her, I'll be back soon.

748
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,480
Over there.

749
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,920
You're a black person
of nearly one ton,

750
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,000
but you have fine feelings
and a delicate spirit.

751
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,040
Yet your ancestors were cannibals.

752
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,280
I have spoken to you about politics, art
and literature, and you understand me.

753
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,920
- Sure. - And my wife, who is more
white than that table cloth,

754
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,400
she has never understood me.
She the brain of a canary.

755
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,920
About what can you speak
to a canary about?

756
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,400
- I don't know.
- Sing me a song.

757
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:56,269
- No, I'm tired. - Come on
- I've been singing all the evening, I'm tired.

758
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,398
Do you know from where we know eachother?
Ragana, tell her.

759
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,636
From prison?

760
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,396
How funny!

761
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:29,040
Do you know what time it is? Nearly 4.

762
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,320
Do you know my friend Peter Sister?
And my friend Ragana?

763
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,993
He was in prison with me.

764
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,920
But who are you? Who do you know?

765
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,876
What do you want from me?

766
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,440
- Did your mother send you?
- She's waiting for us outside, in the taxi.

767
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,991
- Leave, I don't want to see you anymore.
- Where are you running? You're drunk.

768
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,320
You made me lose my job at the newspaper,
because my wage wasn't big enough.

769
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,920
Made me burn my novel, because you
didn't have confidence in me,

770
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,920
- and sent me to school like a deficient child.
- You had convinced yourself…

771
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,120
No, you convinced me. And now that
they have flunked me, I'm content.

772
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,720
I have the entire novel in memory,
therefore I will rewrite it,

773
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,720
- even if it will take me two years of work.
- And what do we eat?

774
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:26,440
Bread and water like in jail.
If you don't want it, go back to your mother.

775
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,520
Unadventurous woman,
you have ruined my life!

776
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:35,400
Really? I gave you all
I had to make you study

777
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,160
and you say I have ruined your life!

778
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,080
Shall we examine our wedding?

779
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,680
Who are we? Are we relatives? No.

780
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,200
You're a stranger I met in a flour mill.

781
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,280
Stranger?

782
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,120
I ran away because we had
decided to live together.

783
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,800
To live together we must
have something in common.

784
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,760
- What do we have in common?
- First of all, a son.

785
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,320
Leave the child out of it,
I'm talking about ideas.

786
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,400
I'm a journalist and you don't
even read the comic strips.

787
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,760
I read you a novel,
and you fall asleep like a goat.

788
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:19,400
I love politics, and despite what
your hyena of a mother thinks,

789
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,960
that is the base of life and all things.

790
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,280
You don't care, because you think you're clever.

791
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:30,200
But you're not clever, you're ignorant.

792
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:34,398
If the atom bomb drops,
it will pulverize even you!

793
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,560
Because of this, we are two strangers.

794
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:45,480
If we have nothing in common, tell me what
has held us together all these years?

795
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,118
The feelings.

796
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,600
- What?
- The feelings, and that's all.

797
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,080
- You have lived with me, like you would
with a woman of the streets? - No.

798
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,240
- I didn't say that.
- Coward!

799
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:07,360
I saved your life, I have loved you,
without knowing who you were!

800
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,760
Now that you're drunk,
you tell me the truth!

801
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:17,640
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- What? - I'm leaving.

802
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,640
I'm leaving forever, and don't
expect me to come back.

803
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,200
And never again seek love and
understanding from me. Never!

804
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,880
How can I find love and understanding

805
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,000
in a woman who cracks the head
of a German with an iron?

806
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:43,792
I have made a single error.
I should have hit you with that iron instead!

807
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:49,440
- And not that German!
- Wait for me, I am on foot. - No!

808
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,960
I'm leaving you alone with
your ideas and your novels!

809
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:59,040
Find yourself another! I want to see
how you fare without me!

810
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,272
- Bye bye!
- I want to see! - Bye bye!

811
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:10,238
You will mourn having abandoned me!
You will repent this act!

812
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,988
One day you will want to talk 
about Silvio Magnozzi!

813
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,431
Elena, turn back!

814
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,880
Bastard.

815
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,838
She has really done it.

816
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,120
Now I'm free and single.

817
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:37,911
- Lucky man! Tell me shepherd, are you happy?
- What do you want, drunkard!

818
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,840
“It was in the days
of the military defeat.

819
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,040
I still wore my second lieutenant's uniform

820
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,920
and I roamed the countryside
under the rain.

821
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,280
Through a clearing in the fog,
a friar with an umbrella appeared.

822
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,559
He was old, but tall and sturdy, and
he walked with decisive, marching steps.

823
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,320
When the friar came closer to me,
I recognized him and got his attention.

824
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:26,160
Is that you, mr. general? Yes, he said to me.
And then he embraced me, crying.

825
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,680
Why are you dressed like a friar?
What are the orders?

826
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:34,240
Against who shall I fight?
I don't know, he answered me.

827
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:39,360
- From that time on, I had to make my own decisions.“
- That is enough.

828
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,960
- One more page, Commander.
- Leave it, Magnozzi.

829
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,040
- We have read your novel. - For 6 months
I've been going from one publisher to the next.

830
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:54,200
My shoes are wearing out.
Everyone says it is beautiful,

831
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,480
but nobody wants to publish it. Why?

832
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,720
- Can I tell you my sincere opinion, Magnozzi?
- Please do.

833
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,632
Your novel is, from an artistic point of view,

834
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,120
mediocre, uninteresting.
It lacks style and form.

835
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,480
Nevermind style and form,
let's talk about the substance.

836
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,720
There is a generation ignoring
the facts I'm describing,

837
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,640
even though they must know them.

838
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:29,200
- Each and every page is a bomb.
- I don't doubt it, but listen to my lawyer.

839
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,480
This is an invite to desertion,
scorn against the Armed Forces,

840
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,640
- offenses against the Army…
- Fascist Army!

841
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,560
Offenses against the magistracy,
critic towards the prison system

842
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,720
and offenses against religion.
- This has to be cut out. - I won't cut anything!

843
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:49,400
- I am ready to take the risk. Are you?
- I'm not.

844
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,760
- Then it is useless to talk to you.
- I don't want to end up in jail.

845
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:57,520
Ten years of my life is in this book!

846
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,960
- Try it on the movies. - Movies?
- Yes.

847
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,112
You will find allies there,
and they will pay more.

848
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,559
Get moving! Improvise!

849
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,520
Mr. Gassman, two words for RAI please.

850
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:22,959
- What are your thoughts about the crisis in cinema?
- There are no ideas or writers anymore.

851
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,596
Thanks.

852
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,000
Mrs., the cigarettes.

853
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,520
Good morning, mrs. Mangano.
I'm Silvio Magnozzi.

854
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,720
- I know, the one with the novel.
- You remember?

855
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:48,200
You phoned me at 3 in the morning,
imitating the voice of De Sica.

856
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,320
- But I don't answer even
De Sica at three! - I'm sorry,

857
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,520
but I've been trying to speak to you for
three months. Will you make a film based on my novel?

858
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:03,160
- I don't decide, director Blasetti does.
He's over there. - Blasetti?

859
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:07,915
- I'll speak with Blasetti, and phone you afterwards.
- Not at the three in the morning.

860
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,789
- Run!
- What has happened?

861
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:24,720
- Mr. Gassman. - See you later.
- Who is that? - Someone looking for money.

862
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,676
Legionaries!

863
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,516
Mr. Gassman, will you allow me?

864
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,880
- Good morning, Blasetti.
- Good morning.

865
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,880
- I'm Silvio Magnozzi, remember me?
- Be energetic with the horses!

866
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,560
Did you read my novel “A difficult life”?

867
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,000
Ah, “A difficult life”! Beautiful!

868
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,120
If you agree to direct the film,
I could sign the contract.

869
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,076
Oh! The horses!

870
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,440
Perhaps you could give me
a small advance payment.

871
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,360
I wouldn't mind making 
a controversial movie,

872
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,512
- but you're forgetting the censorship.
- The censorship? - Yes.

873
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,760
Please come down Blasetti,
can't we talk about this in quiet?

874
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:26,800
- Wait for me at the bar, I have to work.
- At your convenience.

875
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,640
I'll wait here for you to finish.

876
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,280
No, the chariots must pass here.

877
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,238
- I'll go to the bar then.
- Go there

878
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,112
- Get away, the chariots are coming!

879
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,235
- Get away!
- There is a lion there.

880
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,960
Before I was in the tribunal,
but then I fell off a horse,

881
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,396
and now I must play the role of the apostle.

882
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,520
This food is cold, I'll risk a constipation.

883
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,000
- What do you have in your bag, a roast?
- Yes.

884
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,152
- I have chicken with bell peppers.
- Who cares, I'll roast it.

885
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,758
Magnozzi!

886
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,958
- Magnozzi!
- Who are you?

887
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,752
I'm San Matteo!

888
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:53,200
Marquis Capperoni.
The lunch in the Rustichelli house,

889
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,000
- the night in which the king…
- Sure, the marquis!

890
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,920
How are you?
I'm happy to see you again.

891
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,800
- Why are you dressed like that?
- My father is dead, and I have economic problems.

892
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:08,720
- It pays 30,000 liras per day.
Sit down here. - Thanks.

893
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:13,520
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying cinema too.

894
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,200
If I sign this contract,
I will be successful at it.

895
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,158
- Good. - Who is he?
- Saint Peter.

896
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:25,958
Magnozzi, without ceremony.
Chicken with bell peppers.

897
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,158
- Take it as it is. - No…
- Too bad.

898
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:33,075
I saw Elena last week.

899
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,080
- Elena? - Yes.
- Where?

900
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,600
In Viareggio. She works in a fashion store.
You didn't know?

901
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,515
- I haven't seen her for two years.
We are divorced. - I know.

902
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,510
- Did she speak about me?
- Yes, for a long time.

903
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,716
She spoke.

904
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,278
Do you think she wants to come back to me?

905
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,036
What do you advise me to do, marquis?

906
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,556
Forget her.

907
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,953
Why? Another man?

908
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,800
Magnozzi, try to understand.
Don't think about it anymore.

909
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,400
> The apostles!
- I must go. It's my turn.

910
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,552
Can you lend me 50,000 liras?
I want to go to Elena.

911
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,240
- How do I look?
- Very good, you have a beautiful head.

912
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,074
- You will have lots of success.
- Listen, Magnozzi.

913
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:46,560
Now I can only give you 25.
Father is dead.

914
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,920
But you listen to my advise,
don't go to Viareggio, forget her.

915
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,799
- I'll pay you back when I return
from Viareggio. - Pay me when you can.

916
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,356
Hello, Elena.

917
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,992
Who is that beautiful man?

918
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,711
- It's my husband.
- Why is he never here?

919
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,836
What's he doing in Viareggio?

920
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:48,275
- I don't know. - He didn't even
stop. - He'll return.

921
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,198
Excuse me. Hello, Elena.

922
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,636
Hello, Silvio.

923
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,200
- What do you want?
- I'm just passing by.

924
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,480
Can see my son, or is that forbidden?

925
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,440
It's your right.

926
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,680
Where I can find him?

927
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,120
- I have brought him a gift.
- He has gone home now.

928
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,720
Via Garibaldi 10. If it's closed,
the maid will let you in.

929
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,520
- You cannot accompany me?
- I'd rather not.

930
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,149
- What?
- I said I'd rather not.

931
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,600
- And if the maid does not trust me?
- Don't worry, I will phone her.

932
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:33,760
I'll take the child out for lunch,
and then I'll immediately go back to Rome,

933
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,960
because I have lots of job engagements.

934
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,397
- He must be back home before supper.
- Rest assured he will.

935
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,680
- Bye, Elena.
- Bye.

936
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,760
Should you come to Rome, call me.

937
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:50,676
Everything will be at your disposal.
Excuse the disturbance.

938
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,714
Paolino, we're going to eat
on the pirate ship.

939
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,756
Here comes daddy.

940
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,836
- Paolino, does your mother ever talk about me?
- Sometimes.

941
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,068
- What does she say?
- That you're unlucky.

942
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:32,000
Your mother is a great woman,
and we must respect her,

943
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,800
but she reasons like a woman.
It is not true that I am unlucky.

944
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,920
I just haven't found luck yet.
Paolino!

945
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,680
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

946
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,880
I haven't found my luck yet.
Do you understand the difference?

947
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,678
Yes. No.

948
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,560
One day they offered
your father one million,

949
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:00,190
houses, automobiles, motorboats.
Do you know what your father did?

950
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,318
- He refused it all.
- Why?

951
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:11,760
Because to accept all those millions,
I would have had…

952
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,080
It's like if you had to betray
a friend. Would you betray your friend?

953
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,880
- No.
- You understand me.

954
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,560
Your mother didn't understand me.

955
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:28,360
Today you would have been rich, if
I had bowed my head and accepted.

956
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:32,512
- What did you say instead?
- I said no.

957
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,360
Paolino, what are you and your
mother doing this evening?

958
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,440
I watch television,
and mom goes out.

959
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:56,640
- She goes out all evenings?
- No, today is saturday, tomorrow she doesn't work.

960
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,473
- Where does she go?
- I don't know.

961
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:07,080
Do you  know the gentleman who
goes out with mom on saturdays?

962
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:12,200
Yes, he's from Lucca. He has a
beautiful car, a white Mercedes.

963
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,872
- Who is it?
- It's him.

964
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,876
Let's go.

965
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,440
- Mister, that is 4,600 liras.
- Wait for me, I'll be back quickly.

966
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:07,360
Wait, mister!
I have to leave. Pay me now.

967
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:12,320
- Do you not trust me?
- He vomited in the car, and ruined the seats!

968
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:17,200
- I would like him to pay me.
- Very well.

969
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,240
- Is this 5.000?
- No, that is 500.

970
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,196
This is 5.000.

971
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,158
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

972
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:33,318
I'm searching a relative.
I'll have a quick look around, and then leave.

973
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,555
Why run away?
I'm not a leper.

974
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,636
Double Whisky.

975
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,477
- Pardon.

976
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,272
- Carlo, let's leave.
- We cannot run away all night. I'm staying.

977
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,076
Give me a cigarette.

978
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,711
- Do you want to dance?
- No, not now.

979
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:57,520
- Giovanna, go with me. - If you want I can
go with you, but it is wrong.

980
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,876
- I can stay at your place.
- Let's go for a dance.

981
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,200
Excuse me Elena, why did you
run away when you saw me?

982
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:26,800
Do you think I will hurt you?
I'm not armed.

983
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,560
I have never hurt anyone.

984
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:34,560
- Then tell me what you want?
- Than you grant me two minutes of your time.

985
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,480
I have a right to speak for
two minutes with my woman.

986
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,600
We have nothing to speak about.

987
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:46,071
Can't you see I'm in company?
Quit stalking me. I'm fed up!

988
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:55,152
I'm also fed up with this situation,
and I wish for freedom.

989
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:02,360
Excuse me for speaking about
intimate matters, I've also drunk a bit.

990
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,999
Valeria, let's go for a dance.

991
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:17,120
I've made some investigations, and have found
that you haven't yet betrayed me.

992
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,078
But I know I'm in danger.

993
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,674
- I'm here to help you.
Cigarette? - I am smoking.

994
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,476
Smoking too much.

995
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,040
- Today I have spoken for a long time
with our son. - Yes?

996
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:41,192
- He's very intelligent, he understands everything.
- More than you.

997
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,040
Shall we think seriously
about his future?

998
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,556
Silvio, you think about yourself,
I'll think about him.

999
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,475
Elena, who is that man?

1000
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:13,760
He's a person who wants to arrange
mine and our son's life.

1001
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,990
You don't think about it.

1002
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,356
Look at me.

1003
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,999
Do you love him?

1004
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,720
Love isn't important for me anymore.

1005
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,280
It's nothing but an arrangement.

1006
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:36,155
If one seeks only an arrangement, it is very easy.

1007
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,993
I can give you
all those things you want.

1008
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:48,629
Whistle, and I will give you all you desire.

1009
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:59,880
It's easy to make money
like all these people do.

1010
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,836
Lower your voice!

1011
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:07,120
What is more difficult, write an ugly novel,
or to sell household appliances?

1012
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:12,680
Or to live by exploitation, like
all the people of the north do?

1013
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:16,200
While the calabrian peasants
eat their ears with salt on them

1014
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,200
to stop their hunger!

1015
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:24,797
Your friends have beautiful cars,
and they disgust me!

1016
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,600
Careful, behind the wheel of
those cars are rascals.

1017
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,229
- I'm leaving.
- No, stay here, don't leave.

1018
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,080
Then control yourself,
stop acting like a nut.

1019
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:45,156
- I'll be good, we'll talk about our situation.
- Ok, let's talk about it.

1020
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,796
Elena, I love you.

1021
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:56,040
No! You know your hair is beautifully done?

1022
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:01,560
You're beautiful, tanned.
Your arms are warm.

1023
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:06,560
- I have never wanted you
like I do this evening. - Don't do that.

1024
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,720
Come back with me,
we'll be happy together.

1025
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:13,600
- I'm not the way I was.
- You're worse than you were before.

1026
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,080
You drink, you're as pale as a dead man
and you have worn out shoes.

1027
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:22,040
- How will you end up?
- You must help me!

1028
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:25,828
I will do whatever you say.
I will give you whatever you want.

1029
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,920
- Do you need money?
- No, I need you.

1030
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,353
- Get it out of your head!
> Elena.

1031
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,677
- We're leaving.
- I'm coming. Let me go. - Don't leave me!

1032
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,960
- Who are you? > What are you doing?
- Don't you interfere with my life.

1033
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,360
- Gangster!
- Take down your hands!

1034
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:02,000
- Gangster!
- Take down your hands, or you'll feel my fist.

1035
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,160
I'm taking off my jacket,
we'll fight man to man.

1036
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,640
- I don't fear him!
- You're drunk.

1037
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,400
Did he hurt you badly?

1038
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,760
- You're hitting a drunk man?
- I'm fed up, I'm leaving!

1039
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,480
- Leave!
- Thanks, Elena!

1040
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:25,318
I never want to see you again!
If I meet you again, I'll kill you!

1041
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,796
Elena.

1042
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,680
You're a waiter, and I respect you,
but don't you lay hands on me as well.

1043
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,752
Elena! Elena!

1044
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:54,480
Let me go,
I must speak with my wife!

1045
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,199
She's leaving!

1046
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,600
Carlo, stop!

1047
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,034
He left alone.

1048
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,312
Better like that.
It's finished with him too.

1049
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:16,030
- My God, look!
- Elena! Elena!

1050
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,995
Ouch! I hurt my hand.

1051
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,998
The jacket, mister.

1052
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,193
Wimp.

1053
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,549
Unter, mitten...
Are you tourists?

1054
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,760
Why do you come here?
There is nothing to see here.

1055
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:21,791
Everyone here is a bastard.
Don't come to Italy, stay at home.

1056
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,956
Tiè!

1057
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,436
Look.

1058
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,596
Poor mother.

1059
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:36,960
She always wanted me to come driving in a big car.

1060
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,240
- Isn't that a bit exaggerated?
- No, that's what she wanted.

1061
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:46,200
Now she watches us from above, laughing.
Didn't you see their envious look?

1062
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:50,560
- How come you've got that car?
- I have changed.

1063
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,600
I don't drink anymore,
I have recognized all my errors.

1064
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,957
I have modified my ideas.
I have "put my head in place”.

1065
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,600
The way you wanted.
Aren't you happy?

1066
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:06,200
Let's start over.
I will never again make you suffer.

1067
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,636
You have said that many times,
I don't believe you anymore.

1068
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,471
Poor mother.

1069
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,432
Elena.

1070
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:36,955
Our flour mill.

1071
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,916
Good evening, Excellence.

1072
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,750
Good evening.
Thanks for coming.

1073
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,353
Orazio, this is His Excellency.

1074
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,678
- Elena! How are you?
- Hello.

1075
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:21,120
- What a beutiful hairstyle.
- I've been to Gualtiero.

1076
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:25,238
- He's the best in Rome.
- Beautiful house. - Yes, isn't it?

1077
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,360
Ippolito, take the car to the garage.

1078
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,760
- Good evening. 
- Silvio, isn't that my husband's car?

1079
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,800
Yes. My Giulietta is at the mechanic,
and I took advantage of it.

1080
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:40,760
The Commander is possessive about his cars.
That is the last time.

1081
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:45,200
Please excuse me, my wife
wants to meet you,

1082
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:50,194
- and the Commander. May I introduce you to her?
- Afterwards, I have things to to.

1083
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:59,000
- That was the Commander's wife.
- A beautiful woman.

1084
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,920
- How's the Commander's mood?
- He's happy,

1085
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:05,360
- he won 150 million at the casino.
- Did you hear, Elena?

1086
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:08,830
What luck!
Why can't it happen to us?

1087
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:13,960
- I don't play to win.
- How are you?

1088
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:16,315
Do you allow me, Commander?

1089
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:23,440
I asked you a favor,
but you're just beating around the bush.

1090
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:27,520
You know I'm always
at your disposal.

1091
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,990
- Let me introduce my wife.
- Excuse me.

1092
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:36,560
I wanted to meet you,
my husband always talks about you.

1093
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:41,560
- My compliments, she is very pretty.
You don't deserve it. - If you say so…!

1094
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:47,080
From nothing, he has become one of
the most important men in the country.

1095
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:50,360
- Magnozzi, don't flatter me.
- But it's the truth.

1096
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:54,640
Your success covers all fields.
Industry, commerce, newspapers,

1097
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:58,200
- cinema, reviews…
- Records. - Soccer. It's all yours!

1098
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,080
Firstly you court me, and then you 
ask for advance payments.

1099
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:04,600
Now amuse yourselves,
and do as you like.

1100
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,556
Thanks.

1101
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,280
- Nice, isn't he.
- Yes, he's formidable.

1102
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,520
- Any desire can be satisfied here.
- Remember when we used to skip meals?

1103
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,640
- Do you want a little caviar?
- Yes.

1104
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:21,235
- Anchovies?
- The commander wants you.

1105
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,876
Silvio…

1106
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,629
- Where did he go?
- The commander called for him.

1107
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,640
Here I am. My homages, prince.

1108
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:34,600
Who gave the order to publish
these photographs?

1109
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,160
There has been bloodshed in Calabria.

1110
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:40,000
You were not in Rome, and I phoned
the newspaper in your name.

1111
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,240
You remove a page of princes,
and replace it with calabrian labourers?

1112
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:49,400
I think people today are tired
of seeing lots of princes and princesses

1113
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,880
in newspapers.

1114
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:57,840
- Who told you this? - Nobody.
Remember I'm a journalist.

1115
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:04,234
You <i>were</i> a journalist. Now you're one
of my secretaries, and a well paid one.

1116
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,032
You're also an idiot.

1117
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:15,000
- Why? 
- I earn money on my newspaper by publishing

1118
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,480
photos of princes, not of labourers! 
- Certainly.

1119
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:25,640
Forget being a journalist,
and only do what I tell you.

1120
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,800
Very well, commander.

1121
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:33,480
- Is there champagne for everybody?
- Yes, there are 150 bottles.

1122
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:36,080
- Did you phone my dentist?
- Yes, your appointment is on tuesday at 3 o'clock.

1123
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:40,480
- Did you send a transport for his Eminence? 
- Yes, he has arrived.

1124
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,632
- Then go and receive him. - At once.
- I remember that young person…

1125
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,040
Elena, there is hot “profiterole”.

1126
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,996
- Excuse, Elena.
- Silvio.

1127
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,391
Fernando.

1128
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,832
Eminence.

1129
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:30,160
- How many people! - Sit down, your Eminence. 
- I will only stay a few minutes.

1130
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,116
Please.

1131
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:37,680
- What can I offer you? - A glass
of selzter. - Magnozzi. - At once.

1132
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,636
- And you, reverend?
- Nothing, thanks.

1133
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,639
These devices never work.

1134
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:53,640
- You don't know how to pour seltzer.
- It doesn't work.

1135
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,596
Can you see that it works?

1136
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:00,640
After work, me and my collaborators 
become like boys again.

1137
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,120
Let's go to the garden, your Eminence.

1138
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:07,113
Magnozzi.
This way, please.

1139
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,072
The commander spilled a little seltzer on me.

1140
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:36,789
- It was a mistake.
- I saw it.

1141
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:43,871
Is this the job you do?

1142
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:15,000
Here around the swimmingpool, I organize
lunches for poor children.

1143
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,709
- Over there is a small moonlight park…
- Allow me, Eminence.

1144
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:31,875
- Silvio!
- Go and drag him up.

1145
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:40,636
Elena, let's leave.

1146
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,320
- The car?
- No, we're walking.

1147
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,278
We're going to have a nice breath of air.
