1
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:55,804
<i>This is the story of a ship</i>

2
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,927
(Cheering)

3
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:42,494
(Bosun's whistle)

4
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,685
Ship's company...'shun!

5
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,851
Turn aft, right and left.

6
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:47,884
Turn!

7
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:22,731
- Open fire!
- Open fire!

8
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:23,924
Shoot!

9
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:34,446
Look at the Huns, sir. They're jumping
overboard in full marching order.

10
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,646
Look at that. Come in, the water's lovely!

11
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:43,971
Look at'em. Somebody must have
blown a whistle. Layer on.

12
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:53,885
There are a lot more caïques to port, sir,
and some bigger transports.

13
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,368
Shift to the big transports.

14
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:58,691
Aye aye, sir. Check, check, check.
Shift target right. Follow TBI.

15
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:04,164
(Explosion)

16
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:09,046
Can I fire torpedoes at the transports?

17
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:12,610
All right, get your old mouldies off,
but not more than two at any transport.

18
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,044
Flags, make to the division.
Train tubes to port.

19
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:18,087
- Ready port.
- Main office, make Tommy Tommy port.

20
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,124
(Explosion)

21
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,374
That's got'em!

22
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:28,169
- Shoot when you see the whites of their eyes.
<i>- 0-3-5. 1-0 left</i>

23
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,250
Bingo!

24
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,687
- Fire one!
- Fire one!

25
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,092
- Fire two!
- Fire two!

26
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,685
Torpedoes fired, sir.

27
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:47,693
Our fish have hit, sir,
and one transport has blown up.

28
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,048
There goes another.

29
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:54,451
Big stuff.
The rest of the division are doing well.

30
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:56,804
Must be an enemy destroyer, sir.

31
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:58,971
- Right, engage her.
- Aye aye, sir.

32
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:02,087
<i>Check check check.</i>
<i>Shift target left Follow TBI.</i>

33
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,611
Take this. It was my mother's.

34
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,804
Ah!

35
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:25,974
- Trainer on.
- Layer on.

36
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:27,926
- Left gun ready.
- Right gun ready.

37
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:29,454
0-4-0. 1-0 left.

38
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,290
I'll lay you 10-1 they're all Germans.

39
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:56,294
You'd never get the Macaronis to tackle
a job like that, not for love nor money.

40
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,326
The Eyeties will do anything for money.

41
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,845
Anything but fight.
That's why they were so lousy in the last war.

42
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,808
That's on account of their warm,
languorous southern temperament.

43
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,293
- Cocoa, sir.
- Thanks, Snotty.

44
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:14,609
Thank you.

45
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:18,125
Here comes the dawn of a new day, Flags.
It could be an uncomfortable one.

46
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,009
Yes, sir. It's a very pretty sky, sir.
Somebody sent me a calendar rather like that.

47
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,444
- Did it have a squadron of Dorniers on it?
- No, sir.

48
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:28,374
- That's where art parts company with reality.
- You're right, sir.

49
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,212
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

50
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,012
Aircraft in sight astern, sir.

51
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,647
<i>Angle of sight 2-0.</i>

52
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:55,289
Looks like a couple of squadrons
of Junkers 88's.

53
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,530
- Starboard 20.
- Aye aye, sir. Starboard 20.

54
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,850
- One blast on the siren.
- Aye aye, sir.

55
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:01,924
(Siren)

56
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,372
Aircraft in sight, bearing green 1-7-0.
Angle of sight 2-0.

57
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:11,169
Short-range weapons. Aircraft in sight.
Stand by for dive bombers.

58
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,044
Open fire!

59
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,369
<i>Shoot.</i>

60
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,693
The first wave are diving now.

61
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:35,929
Hard a-port.

62
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,569
- Sound two blasts.
- Aye aye, sir.

63
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:41,607
<i>All guns, sector independent.</i>

64
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:54,293
Down, everybody

65
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:10,924
Hard a-starboard.

66
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,852
We got one. Try and get two next time.

67
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:17,292
<i>Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!</i>

68
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,724
All guns shift to the next wave. Red 1-4-0.

69
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:22,887
<i>Short-range weapons.</i>

70
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:25,165
Shift to the next wave. Bearing red 1-4-0.

71
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,051
- Hard a-starboard.
<i>- Hard a-starboard.</i>

72
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,972
- Sound one blast.
- Aye aye, sir.

73
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,973
(Gunfire)

74
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,209
We've winged that one.

75
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,330
Down, everybody!

76
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,123
Midships.

77
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,654
Aye aye, sir. Midships.

78
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,368
There's another wave on the port side, sir.

79
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,404
(Explosion)

80
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:11,084
<i>- Hard a-starboard.</i>
<i>- Hard a-starboard, sir.</i>

81
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,447
(Rapid gunfire)

82
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:22,815
The leader of this wave
is coming much lower, sir.

83
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:26,883
He'll probably hit our mast.

84
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:53,411
Well done.
We've got him, but I'm afraid he's got us too.

85
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:54,444
Midships.

86
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,614
Midships, sir.

87
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,130
- Carry on firing. Here comes the next wave.
- All guns are still in action.

88
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:19,763
Stop both.

89
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:29,164
No answer from the engine room, sir.
The telegraphs must be shot away.

90
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,807
I'm afraid we're going over.

91
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:33,415
Pass the word to cast loose the Carley floats.

92
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,290
(Gunfire and explosions)

93
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:39,893
Abandon ship!

94
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:33,523
(Echoing)
<i>I'll sign for her now I'lll sign for her now.</i>

95
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:36,043
<i>I'll sign for her now I'll sign for her now.</i>

96
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:57,408
- Has Satterthwaite been sighted?
- No, sir, but it's just on ten o'clock.

97
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:58,683
(Banging)

98
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:01,454
Stop that hammering, Edgecombe.
I can't hear myself think.

99
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:02,894
<i>Aye aye.</i> sir

100
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:07,053
Tell No.1 to fall in the hands
on the quarterdeck.

101
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:17,210
Shall we have it on the desk or the shelf, sir?

102
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:19,450
Shelf. We'll have the usual one on the desk.

103
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,087
- Wedding dress, sir?
- Yes.

104
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,451
- It's here, sir.
- Good. Give it to me.

105
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:45,174
- Mr Satterthwaite's coming on board, sir.
- Is No.1 bringing him down? Hands all aft?

106
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:46,204
(Knock at door)

107
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:47,813
Mr Satterthwaite, sir.

108
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,368
- Good morning.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

109
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:51,212
- Everything in order?
- Certainly.

110
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,291
We'd better get this little ceremony over.

111
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:56,691
- Were you satisfied with the trial?
- Yes, she's a well-found ship.

112
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:59,693
We'll be hoisting the ensign
in a couple of minutes, Edgecombe.

113
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:02,727
- Now, then.
- Are you prepared to take over the ship, sir?

114
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,447
Yes, I'll sign for her now.

115
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:16,409
<i>Watch your head, sir.</i> 
<i>Watch your head, sir.</i>

116
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:18,689
Watch your head, sir.

117
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,134
(Klaxon)

118
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:33,371
- You can smoke if you like.
- Thank you, sir.

119
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:36,054
- Will you have one, sir?
- No, thanks, not at the moment.

120
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:38,529
- Heard from your missus?
- I had a letter last week.

121
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,214
- One of the usuals, full of complaints.
- What's wrong?

122
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,450
Her mother was took bad
and had to go to hospital.

123
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:46,134
That old woman's always in trouble.
I think she enjoys it.

124
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,403
What's the matter with her?

125
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,889
Last time it was her back,
this time it's her stomach.

126
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:53,211
It seems she can't keep anything down.
It's not for want of trying.

127
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:56,213
- You'll be glad to be going to sea.
- To put it mildly, sir!

128
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:08,607
- Darling! I thought you were never coming.
- Everything under control?

129
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:12,011
Far from it. We've been in an uproar all day
since your telegram came.

130
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,044
Daddy!

131
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,134
Hello, Bobby.

132
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,887
- We've been waiting for hours.
- Mummy wanted us to go to bed.

133
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:26,211
- We saw the ship, Daddy.
- We took our tea on the cliffs and saw it go by.

134
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:28,052
- Not "it", Lavvy. Her.
- That's right.

135
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:29,448
She looked beautiful, Teddy.

136
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,451
How fast was she going? Was it 40 knots?

137
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,372
Good heavens, no. She was only doing 20.

138
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:36,532
- But she can do more than that, can't she?
- You bet she can.

139
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,453
Take the car round.
Then give Ellen a hand with dinner.

140
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,645
- Good evening, Edgecombe.
<i>- Evening ma'am.</i>

141
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:43,572
I hope it's a good dinner. I'm starving.

142
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:47,369
- Can I tell him what it is, Mummy?
- It's a surprise. She mustn't spoil it.

143
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,612
- Bobby, keep still. How long have you got?
- Till the morning.

144
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,293
Can we come to the dockyard?

145
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:54,849
No, son. We're commissioning,
making a rush job of it.

146
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:57,648
- But Mummy promised...
- That's enough. You heard Daddy.

147
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,687
But we shall be able to come on board
before you go, shan't we?

148
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:03,329
- Well, we'll make time somehow.
- When, Daddy? When?

149
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,093
Bobby, don't be so persistent.

150
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:08,332
Children, it's dreadfully late.
You really will have to go to bed.

151
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,364
Oh, Mummy.

152
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,929
Daddy will come up and say good night
if you're quick.

153
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,408
But I want to hear about the ship.

154
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:17,084
I'll tell you about it in the morning.
You can fire as many questions as you like.

155
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:19,444
Be good, do as your mother tells you,
and go to bed.

156
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:22,009
- Can I ask questions, too?
- You never do anything else.

157
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:23,613
Go on. Off you go, both of you.

158
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:26,089
- I'll be up in ten minutes. Promise.
- Promise?

159
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:27,853
- Are you coming up, too, Mummy?
- Yes.

160
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,886
Come on, Lavvy, I'll race you.

161
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,534
Wait. That's not fair!

162
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:36,133
They've been wild with excitement all day.

163
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,689
Darling, you must be exhausted.
I'll get you a drink.

164
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,487
Whisky and soda or a cocktail?

165
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,924
As it's a gala evening,
let's have a Kinross special.

166
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:45,284
I guessed it. It's all ready, only wants the ice.

167
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:47,724
I made a private bet
that you'd forget the Cointreau.

168
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,131
Wrong again.
I had a sort of feeling this was an occasion.

169
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:53,405
Were the trials satisfactory?
Were you pleased?

170
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:57,289
<i>More than pleased. She's a lovely ship.</i>
<i>Does what she's told without a murmur.</i>

171
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:59,724
Why are you making a rush job
of the commissioning?

172
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,733
<i>- I like getting things done quickly.</i>
- Is that the only reason?

173
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:06,211
We're living in strange times, darling.
It's as well to be prepared.

174
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:07,927
Yes, I suppose it is.

175
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:09,647
<i>It's nothing to worry about.</i>

176
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:13,210
No, of course not.
Here, try this. It may be a bit too sweet.

177
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:15,971
My love.
My love.

178
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,493
Just right, not a bit too sweet.

179
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:20,854
Miss me?

180
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:23,011
Of course not. I never gave you a thought.

181
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:24,568
What's the surprise for dinner?

182
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,175
Grouse. Maureen sent us a brace
from Scotland.

183
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,012
There's a girl of fine perception.

184
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:31,774
They're a bit high, but I expect you'll like that.

185
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:32,964
Is that a new dress?

186
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,006
Oh, no, darling. I've had it for ages.

187
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:38,764
- I swear I've never clapped eyes on it before.
- Only about 20 times, my love.

188
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:42,125
Perhaps it's you that looked new.
As good as new, anyway.

189
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:46,690
- Is there going to be a war, do you think?
- Yes, I think there is.

190
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:49,884
Oh.

191
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:53,484
No good worrying about it till it comes.
Not much good then, really.

192
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:54,524
No.

193
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,174
Don't be sad.

194
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:00,363
I'm not sad, really. I'm just sort of...

195
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:01,814
gathering myself together.

196
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:05,086
- Any more Kinross special left in the shaker?
- Yes, of course.

197
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:12,247
However busy you are, and however quickly
you've got to get your commissioning done,

198
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:16,208
I should like to come on board just once
before you go to sea to give the ship my love.

199
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,723
You'll have to.
My cabin's got to be made presentable.

200
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,811
- Is the chintz all right?
- First class.

201
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:24,643
Good. We'd better drink these up quickly
and go up to the children.

202
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,765
Dinner will be ready in a minute.

203
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:27,804
Here we go.

204
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:29,964
Here we go.

205
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:48,928
Swim to the float.

206
00:19:49,975 --> 00:19:51,488
Swim to the float.

207
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:57,927
(Coughing and spluttering)

208
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:08,533
(Gunfire)

209
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:20,007
(Aircraft returns)

210
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:05,726
(Aircraft flies over)

211
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,127
Heave!

212
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:41,972
I've got some brandy in my Gieves.

213
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:05,644
Kath.

214
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:08,964
Kath.

215
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,004
Kath.

216
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:31,327
Here's the paper, dear.

217
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,208
I shan't have time
to do more than look at the headlines.

218
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,974
- There you are, then.
- It don't look too good, does it?

219
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:40,928
Oh, you can't believe anything they say.
Look at all the fuss we had last year.

220
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:44,047
Everybody flying about in aeroplanes
and making speeches.

221
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:45,813
After all that, nothing happened.

222
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,892
Nothing happened to us,
but a hell of a lot happened to other people.

223
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:51,733
- Do you really think we'll have another war?
- Looks like it.

224
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,652
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

225
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:56,084
You may see it quicker than you bargained for.

226
00:22:56,135 --> 00:23:00,287
I don't believe that Hitler'd be so silly.
What would he expect to gain by having a war?

227
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:03,532
World domination,
that's what that little rat's after.

228
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:06,373
They haven't got enough to eat in Germany
as it is.

229
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:09,293
Mrs Blacket's nephew,
the one that travels in underwear,

230
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,644
came back from Berlin two months ago.

231
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:15,654
- He said they was all half-starved.
- I can't help what Mrs Blacket's nephew says.

232
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:19,483
- I think we're for it.
- Well, if we have another war, I give up, see,

233
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,446
after all we went through last time.

234
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:25,170
All <i>you</i> went through? You was too young
and innocent to know about anything.

235
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:29,606
Don't talk so silly. You know perfectly well
how old I am, so don't pretend you don't.

236
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,771
You'll always be young and innocent to me.

237
00:23:31,815 --> 00:23:33,248
Will I indeed, now?

238
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:36,970
If you ask me, you've got a hangover
from all that beer you put away last night.

239
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,084
I must be going.

240
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:41,093
- Is Mother coming down?
- I promised I'd call her. Wait a minute.

241
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,444
<i>Mother? Walter's just going.</i>

242
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,089
- You'd better come down as you are.
- That will be nice.

243
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:50,765
Will you get ashore after commissioning?
Before you go to sea, I mean.

244
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:54,410
That all depends. Don't forget
to put those bulbs in when the time comes.

245
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,764
- You and your bulbs!
- Goodbye, old girl.

246
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:01,290
Walter Hardy, whatever is the matter with you?

247
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,485
Anyone would think
you was going away for ever.

248
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:04,650
You never know.

249
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,925
You ought be ashamed of yourself, saying that.

250
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:09,170
<i>And give them a piece of my mind.</i>

251
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,807
Here comes Mother.

252
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,728
That spirit lamp of mine
will be the death of me yet.

253
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:18,654
- What's the matter with it?
- It blew up again. Frightened the wits out of me.

254
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:20,572
You will put in too much methylated.

255
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:23,971
What do you want to go fussing about
with spirit lamps in your bedroom for?

256
00:24:24,015 --> 00:24:26,483
You could pop down to the kitchen.
Nobody'd notice.

257
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:29,174
I've made my own tea
in my own bedroom all my life.

258
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,092
I don't see any reason to stop now.

259
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,445
Yes, but that doesn't happen to be
your own bedroom. It's my spare.

260
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:37,931
If you go on blowing things up in it,
it won't be fit to sleep in.

261
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,852
Stop it, you two. I've got to go now.

262
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,887
A nice thing,
when my own daughter starts criticising me.

263
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:46,484
Oh, shut up, Mother. Say goodbye to Walter.
That's what you came down for.

264
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:49,003
- Will you get ashore again?
- All depends on Hitler.

265
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,647
Who does he think he is, anyway?

266
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:54,973
That's the spirit! Goodbye, Mother.
Look after Kath for me.

267
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,973
Don't you two go nagging each other
from morning to night.

268
00:24:58,015 --> 00:24:59,050
Nagging?

269
00:24:59,095 --> 00:25:01,325
I like that, I must say.

270
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,933
Come on, Kath.

271
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:08,091
- Goodbye, old girl.
- Goodbye, dear.

272
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,052
Ship's company...'shun.

273
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:18,444
(Whistle)

274
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:30,164
- Ship's company present, sir.
- Thanks, No.1. Stand them at ease.

275
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:33,649
Ship's company, stand at... ease.

276
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,772
Break ranks and gather round me.

277
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:48,769
- Can you hear me all right at the back?
ALL: Aye aye, sir.

278
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:52,854
It's the custom for the captain to address
the ship's company on Commissioning Day

279
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:55,568
to give them his policy
and tell them the ship's programme.

280
00:25:55,615 --> 00:26:00,405
Now, my policy's easy. If there are any here
who've served with me before, they'll know it.

281
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:02,446
Are there any old shipmates of mine here?

282
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,251
Oh, glad to see you again, Reynolds.

283
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:06,694
And Adams.

284
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:07,963
And Blake.

285
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:09,209
And Coombe.

286
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:11,405
Who's the small fellow behind the chief stoker?

287
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:12,968
Parkinson, sir.

288
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:15,324
Coxswain of the All Comers whaler
in the Valletta?

289
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,128
I was that, sir, when we won the cup
in the 1936 regatta.

290
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:20,564
And fell into the ditch when you got to the ship.

291
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:25,413
Well, there are enough old shipmates
to tell the others what my policy's always been.

292
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,492
Reynolds, Adams, Blake, Coombe, Parkinson,

293
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:31,208
what sort of a ship do I want the Torrin to be?

294
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,530
- A happy ship, sir.
<i>- That's right.</i>

295
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,928
An efficient ship, sir.

296
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:35,964
Correct.

297
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,006
A happy and efficient ship.

298
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,330
A very happy and a very efficient ship.

299
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,570
You might think I'm ambitious wanting both,

300
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:45,527
but in my experience,
you can't have one without the other.

301
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:49,693
A ship can't be happy unless she's efficient,
and won't be efficient unless she's happy.

302
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:50,963
Now for our programme.

303
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:54,724
<i>You've seen the commissioning programme</i>
<i>published in Plymouth General Orders.</i>

304
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:58,370
And you will have noted
that this allows the company three weeks.

305
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:00,007
Well, you've all read your papers.

306
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:03,650
Ribbentrop signed a non -aggression pact
with Stalin yesterday.

307
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:06,129
As I see it, that means war next week.

308
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:10,407
<i>So I will give you not three weeks but exactly</i>
<i>three days to get this ship ready to sail.</i>

309
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:15,210
None of us will turn in or take our clothes off
or sling our hammocks till the job's finished.

310
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:19,771
Then we'll send Hitler a telegram saying,
"The Torrin's ready. You can start your war."

311
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:29,485
You four bring in the sugar, you six gas masks,
and I'll join you and bring in the rum.

312
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,247
Wake up, England. You've had your hour.
It's my turn now.

313
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,566
RADIO: <i>Here is an announcement.</i>

314
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:29,247
<i>At 11:15, that is, in about two minutes,</i>
<i>the Prime Minister will broadcast to the nation.</i>

315
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,887
<i>Please stand by.</i>

316
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:38,452
(Bells chime)

317
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:47,647
CHAMBERLAIN: <i>I am speaking to you</i>
<i>from the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.</i>

318
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:57,607
<i>This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin</i>
<i>handed the German government a final note</i>

319
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:03,412
<i>stating that unless we heard from them</i>
<i>by 11 o'clock</i>

320
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:08,734
<i>that they were prepared at once</i>
<i>to withdraw their troops from Poland,</i>

321
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:12,484
<i>a state of war would exist between us.</i>

322
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:19,644
<i>I have to tell you now</i>
<i>that no such undertaking has been received</i>

323
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:24,769
<i>and that consequently</i>
<i>this country is at war with Germany.</i>

324
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:33,412
<i>You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me...</i>

325
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:35,411
It ain't exactly a bank holiday for us.

326
00:29:57,735 --> 00:29:59,214
She's still afloat.

327
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,647
Yes, sir.

328
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:09,411
ALIX KINROSS: <i>God bless this ship</i>
<i>and all who sail in her.</i>

329
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:13,164
<i>God bless this ship and all who sail in her.</i>

330
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:19,733
(Distant) # O hear us when we cry to thee

331
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:26,772
# For those in peril on the sea

332
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:33,971
# O Trinity of love and power

333
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:39,567
# Our brethren shield in danger's hour

334
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:46,252
# From rock and tempest, fire and foe

335
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:52,609
# Protect them wheresoe'er they go

336
00:30:52,655 --> 00:30:58,685
# Thus evermore shall rise to thee

337
00:30:58,735 --> 00:31:07,006
# Glad hymns of praise from land and sea

338
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:11,970
# Amen

339
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,774
Let us pray.

340
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:21,968
Eternal Lord God, who spreadest out
the heavens and rulest the raging of the sea,

341
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:25,371
who has compassed the waters with bounds
until day and night end,

342
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:28,168
be pleased to receive
into thy most gracious protection

343
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:31,252
the persons of us, thy servants,
and the fleet in which we serve.

344
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:34,492
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea
and the violence of the enemy,

345
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:38,528
that we may be a safeguard unto
our most gracious sovereign lord, King George,

346
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:41,726
and a security for such as pass on the seas
upon their lawful occasions.

347
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:45,450
That the inhabitants of our island may
in peace and quietness serve thee, our God,

348
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:49,693
and that we may return to enjoy the blessings
of the land with the fruits of our labours,

349
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:53,728
with the thankful remembrance of thy mercies
to praise and glorify thy holy name.

350
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:55,333
Through Jesus Christ our Lord...

351
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,173
Amen.

352
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:01,287
We will now sing the carol
on the back of the hymn card.

353
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:03,324
(Coughing)

354
00:32:04,815 --> 00:32:09,172
# Good King Wenceslas looked out

355
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:13,413
# On the feast of Stephen

356
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:17,494
# When the snow lay round about

357
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,050
# Deep and crisp and even

358
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,413
# Brightly shone the moon that night

359
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:27,686
# Though the frost was cruel

360
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:31,011
# When a poor man came in sight

361
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:35,412
# Gathering winter fuel

362
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:38,572
# Hither, page, come stand by me

363
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:40,094
# If thou...
(Whistle)

364
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,287
(Laughter)

365
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:50,524
Them kids have been at it all day.
Beats me why their mothers let'em do it.

366
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:52,327
Oh, it's the Christmas spirit, Mum.

367
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:57,051
I'll give'em Christmas spirit, coming home
with their feet sopping, getting colds.

368
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:59,245
This is the time for goodwill towards all men.

369
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,763
Can't have you grumbling
as if it was an ordinary day.

370
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,045
Me grumble? Well, I like that, I must say.

371
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:07,167
I remember in the last war
spending Christmas in the Red Sea.

372
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:10,685
We was coming home from Aden.
Hot? You could have fried an egg on the deck.

373
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,090
The Red Sea is hot, all right.
So's the Persian Gulf.

374
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:14,807
I was out there two years ago.

375
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:18,973
The fridge went wonky and everything went bad,
including the language.

376
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:21,290
You certainly see life in the big ships.

377
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,087
We don't do so badly in the small ones.

378
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,808
<i>Oh they're off again. Stop'em somebody.</i>

379
00:33:25,855 --> 00:33:27,413
I'm not starting anything.

380
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:30,811
It's a darned sight more lively in a big cruiser.
It stands to reason.

381
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,368
It don't do no such thing.

382
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:35,373
You're a Marine.
You don't know nothing about destroyers.

383
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,133
What's the matter with the Marines?

384
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,769
Well, Bert, I'm afraid I'll have to tell you.

385
00:33:39,815 --> 00:33:44,013
- Where would the Navy be without us?
- Without a Navy, there wouldn't be no Marines.

386
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,127
Oh, shut up, you two. Who cares anyway?

387
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:50,326
That's a nice way to talk, and no mistake!
You, the mother of a sailor.

388
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:54,129
- And the mother-in -law of a Marine.
- Pass the port wine and don't talk so silly.

389
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:57,611
- I'm as dry as a bone.
- Mum's right. What's the sense in arguing?

390
00:33:57,655 --> 00:33:59,885
We was only having a friendly discussion.

391
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:03,723
You'll be saying next it was a friendly discussion
last night in the Green Man.

392
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,766
Why, you had the whole place in an uproar!

393
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:08,326
Bert, I give you a toast.

394
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:12,527
The Royal Marines - God bless'em and
a happy Christmas to every man jack of'em.

395
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:14,531
The Royal Marines.

396
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:26,368
Thanks, Shorty, old man.
I respond to your toast in a fitting manner.

397
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:28,975
On behalf of my corps,
of which I am justly proud...

398
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:30,004
Hear, hear.

399
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:32,569
...I give you destroyers,
and the Torrin in particular.

400
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:35,368
<i>- May her shadow never grow less.</i>
- It never will.

401
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,088
Destroyers and HMS Torrin.

402
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:43,133
I should like to take the opportunity
of this festive occasion

403
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:45,643
to drink the healths of one and all present,

404
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:48,493
and to thank a kindly fate for so arranging

405
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:52,323
that my ship should have to come home
for boiler cleaning two days before Christmas -

406
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,970
a bit of luck which any sailor would tell you
is little short of a bloody miracle.

407
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:59,212
Walter, how can you?
You know I don't like you using that word.

408
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:02,452
Be that as it may, Kath,
that's a highly expressive word.

409
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:06,170
It's been bound up with naval tradition
since times immemorial.

410
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:08,126
I have heard it whispered in the RAF.

411
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:12,088
Well, be that as it may, I would like to add
that I consider we're all...

412
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:14,483
<i>...very</i> lucky...

413
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:19,371
...to be together on this happy day,
taking into account there's a war on

414
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:23,090
and civilisation happens to be trembling
on the edge of an abyss.

415
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:25,251
- There, now.
- What did you say, Kath?

416
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:26,694
I only said, "There, now."

417
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:29,249
Well, don't say it again.
You know it only puts me off.

418
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:33,612
What are you giggling about, Freda,
if I may make so bold?

419
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:36,249
Nothing, really. It's just the way you talk.

420
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:40,447
What you young flibbertigibbets don't realise
is that this is a very important war indeed.

421
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:44,408
War or no war, you certainly like listening
to the sound of your own voice.

422
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,730
Oh, let him get on with his speech, Kath.

423
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:48,527
Try and stop him.

424
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:52,124
I will treat these paltry interruptions
with the contempt they deserve,

425
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:55,724
and go on to propose the health
of one who is very dear to me.

426
00:35:55,775 --> 00:35:59,973
<i>She's a creature of many moods</i>
<i>and fads and fancies.</i>

427
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:06,488
She is, to coin a phrase, very often uncertain
and coy and hard to please.

428
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:11,086
But I'm devoted to her
with every fibre in my being,

429
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:15,765
and I hereby swear to be true to her
in word and deed, so help me God.

430
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:19,246
Ladies and gentlemen, HMS Torrin.

431
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:21,286
ALL: HMS Torrin.

432
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:24,134
(Tapping on table)

433
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:26,166
Ladies and gentlemen, the King.

434
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,374
ALL: The King.

435
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,730
- We can smoke now, can't we?
- Yes, of course.

436
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,766
You promised to pull the first one with me.

437
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,692
Come on. Take a strong grip and pull.

438
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:38,884
Come on, old girl.

439
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:42,455
- Enjoying yourself?
- Very, very much.

440
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:46,329
That cap's absolutely wizard.
You ought to have a hat made like it.

441
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,013
Doesn't the tree look sweet?

442
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:50,410
Alix and I spent hours fixing it.

443
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:52,730
This is the best Christmas I've ever had.

444
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,766
- Is it?
- Stop whispering, you two.

445
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:57,454
You really oughtn't
to have put them next to each other.

446
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:59,690
We ought to drink to them.
Come on, everybody.

447
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:00,929
To the newly betrothed.

448
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:02,454
ALL: The newly betrothed.

449
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:09,287
- What's betrothed, Daddy?
- The beginning of the end, my boy.

450
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:14,811
On behalf of my fiancée and myself,
thank you very kindly.

451
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:18,643
As Flags and Maureen are so bashful,
I think that <i>you</i> should make a speech, Alix.

452
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,767
- Oh, no, honestly, I couldn't.
- Come on, Alix. I'll support you.

453
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:24,329
Oh, Teddy, I shall never forgive you for this.

454
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,728
Oh, dear!

455
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,130
- What am I to say? Just you wait.
<i>- Happy Christmas.</i>

456
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:29,733
Come on, now. Silence, everybody.

457
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:32,243
The Lady Mayoress
is about to declare the bazaar open.

458
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:34,092
Don't let him get you down, Alix.

459
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:37,923
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll begin by taking my husband's advice...

460
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:42,173
<i>- Hooray!</i>
...and wishing you all a very happy Christmas.

461
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:45,446
I'm sure Elizabeth and June will back me up

462
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:49,408
when I say I am going to deliver,
on behalf of all wretched naval wives,

463
00:37:49,455 --> 00:37:51,491
a word of warning to Maureen,

464
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,003
<i>who has been unwise enough</i>
<i>to decide to join our ranks.</i>

465
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,044
<i>Hear hear!</i>

466
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:58,246
Dear Maureen,
we all wish you every possible happiness,

467
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:01,924
but I think it only fair to tell you in advance
exactly what you are in for.

468
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:02,964
Shame, shame.

469
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:06,530
Speaking from bitter experience,

470
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,488
I can only say that the wife of a sailor
is most profoundly to be pitied.

471
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:15,245
To begin with, her home life,
what there is of it, has no stability whatever.

472
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,172
She can never really settle down.

473
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:20,093
She moves through a succession
of other people's houses,

474
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:21,887
flats and furnished rooms.

475
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,893
She finds herself having to grapple
with domestic problems

476
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,891
in Bermuda, Malta or Weymouth.

477
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:32,606
We will not deal with the question of pay.
That is altogether too painful.

478
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:36,853
What we will deal with
is the most important disillusionment of all.

479
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:39,887
- And that is...
<i>- Stop her, somebody. This is rank mutiny.</i>

480
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:42,369
And that is, that wherever she goes,

481
00:38:42,415 --> 00:38:46,454
there is always in her life
a permanent and undefeated rival.

482
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:49,207
Her husband's ship.

483
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:51,644
Whether it be a battleship or a sloop,

484
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:53,606
a submarine or a destroyer,

485
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:56,123
it holds first place in his heart.

486
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:59,611
It comes before wife, home,
children, everything.

487
00:39:00,615 --> 00:39:04,130
Some of us try to fight this
and get badly mauled in the process.

488
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,770
Others, like myself,
resign themselves to the inevitable.

489
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:11,574
That is what you will have to do,
my poor Maureen.

490
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:15,927
That is what we all have to do
if we want any peace of mind at all.

491
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:17,454
Ladies and gentlemen,

492
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:20,454
I give you my rival.

493
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:25,885
It's extraordinary
that anyone could be so fond...

494
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:30,852
...and so proud of their most implacable enemy.

495
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:34,734
This ship.

496
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:39,770
God bless this ship, and all who sail in her.

497
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:05,487
Well... she did her stuff, sir.

498
00:40:08,215 --> 00:40:10,206
Best ship I ever served in, sir.

499
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:11,734
That goes for me too, sir.

500
00:40:11,775 --> 00:40:15,131
It makes one feel sort of lost, doesn't it?

501
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:18,245
A very happy and a very efficient ship, sir.

502
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:21,414
Thank you.

503
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,246
(Snivels)

504
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,207
Wipe your face, Edgecombe.
You don't want oil fuel in your eyes.

505
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,654
Aye aye, sir.

506
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:40,653
Well... do you know what I'd like now?
Anice hot cup of tea.

507
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,208
I'd like a nice beer myself.

508
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:44,564
Look out! Here come the bastards back again.

509
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:47,773
Keep your heads down, get as low as you can!

510
00:40:50,095 --> 00:40:51,494
Missed, butterfingers!

511
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:02,611
Blimey. I spoke too soon.

512
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:22,446
- Aargh!
- Did it get you badly?

513
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,254
Don't rightly know, sir.

514
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:26,694
Knife, somebody.

515
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:29,734
Cut his sleeve carefully.

516
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,974
Hit a mother with a baby in her arms, you would.

517
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:50,574
Oh, look, boys.

518
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,007
Shot through the heart.

519
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:57,604
- I always did hate the sight of blood.
- Give us a rag, somebody.

520
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,489
<i>What's your name? What's your name?</i>

521
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,325
<i>What's your name? What's your name?</i>

522
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:13,483
<i>What's your name? What's your name?</i>

523
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,293
<i>What's your name?</i>

524
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:18,132
Quite a loving cup, isn't it?

525
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:21,884
You never know your luck.
I always say travel broadens the mind.

526
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:25,132
Now then, saucy.
You keep your hands to yourself.

527
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,927
- Want a drop, dear?
- No, thanks.

528
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:28,408
Come on. It won't hurt you.

529
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:31,049
I'd rather not, thanks all the same. I don't like it.

530
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:34,485
Oh, fancy that, now! Ever so sorry, I'm sure.

531
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:37,049
If she doesn't want it,
she doesn't have to have it.

532
00:42:37,095 --> 00:42:40,451
Who do you think you are, anyway?
Father Flanagan?

533
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:44,693
Here, play a hymn, there's a dear.
I didn't know we was in Sunday school.

534
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:47,010
Some people don't know
when they've had enough.

535
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:48,693
What was that you said?

536
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:50,487
You heard. You ain't got cloth ears.

537
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,526
Here, miss, you change places with me.

538
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:56,454
- It's all right, really.
- You'll be more comfortable in the corner.

539
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:03,054
I'd be ever so much obliged, I'm sure,
if you'd change places with me, too.

540
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:05,655
My mother always warned me
never to sit next to sailors.

541
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:08,812
Pity she didn't warn you
about a few other things while she was at it.

542
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:11,164
Ah, shut up arguing, pal. Here, have a fag.

543
00:43:11,215 --> 00:43:12,614
Life's too short.

544
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:18,726
# If you were the only

545
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:21,608
# Girl in the world

546
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:26,410
# And I was the only boy

547
00:43:27,455 --> 00:43:33,246
# Nothing else would matter in the world today

548
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:35,570
# We could go on loving...

549
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:37,014
Comfy?

550
00:43:38,135 --> 00:43:40,126
Yes, thanks.

551
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:43,452
What's your name?

552
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,530
Freda. Freda Lewis.

553
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:49,533
Freda? It's a pretty name, isn't it?

554
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:51,293
- Is it?
- Do you mind if I smoke?

555
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:52,734
Of course not.

556
00:43:53,415 --> 00:43:56,407
- Have one?
- I don't mind.

557
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:59,891
These are special, HM ships only.
We get'em in the canteen.

558
00:43:59,935 --> 00:44:03,052
My uncle by marriage is in the Navy.
He's on a destroyer.

559
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,529
Isn't that a coincidence, now? So am I.

560
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:06,974
There, now.

561
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:13,406
He's a petty officer.
They call him by a funny name.

562
00:44:13,455 --> 00:44:15,446
We often call petty officers funny names.

563
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:17,804
- It begins with a B.
- It generally does.

564
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,607
Oh, you are awful!

565
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:21,293
What's his ship?

566
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:24,293
I'm not supposed to tell you that, am I?
It's careless talk.

567
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:26,724
You can tell me.
I'm in the same firm, as you might say.

568
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:29,243
Well, chief buffer, that's what he's called.

569
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:30,774
He's on the Torrin.

570
00:44:31,775 --> 00:44:34,767
Well, it's a small world, and no error!
Here, Joey.

571
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:37,454
<i>Our chief buffer's her uncle by marriage.</i>

572
00:44:37,495 --> 00:44:39,053
Makes you sort of Siamese twins.

573
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:41,404
This is my friend Joey Mackeridge.

574
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:42,649
Miss Lewis.

575
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:45,653
- How do you do?
<i>- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure</i>

576
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,094
What's your name?

577
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,684
- Funny us meeting like that, wasn't it?
- Yes.

578
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:53,807
- Sort of... unexpected.
- Yes.

579
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:58,451
That long train, all them people in it,
and I had to pick on that one carriage.

580
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:01,567
- It's fate, I shouldn't wonder.
- Yeah, I feel that way, too.

581
00:46:01,615 --> 00:46:05,608
- I suppose we ought really to be going now.
- Yeah, I suppose we ought.

582
00:46:05,655 --> 00:46:08,533
Your family will be wondering
what's happened to you.

583
00:46:08,575 --> 00:46:11,089
- Well, I'm wondering that myself.
- How can you?

584
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,569
Does er... Does your aunt let you go out much?

585
00:46:13,615 --> 00:46:16,083
She doesn't mind,
so long as I don't get back too late.

586
00:46:16,135 --> 00:46:18,774
What about tomorrow?
We might go to the Palais de Danse.

587
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:20,214
- Do you like dancing?
- Yes.

588
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:23,645
Well, that's a date, then.
6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.

589
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:26,050
You don't waste much time, do you?

590
00:46:26,095 --> 00:46:29,804
- I can't afford to. I've only got weekend leave.
- That's not long.

591
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:42,454
Well, here we are.
Come in and meet my mum and dad.

592
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:45,851
No, not now. I'd really rather not.
I've got to be getting along.

593
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:50,252
- And they wouldn't want a stranger butting in.
- You're not a stranger, not any more.

594
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:52,604
Ah, but to them I would be.

595
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:54,452
Give me that bag, there's a dear.

596
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:57,168
Not until you say it's OK about tomorrow night.

597
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:01,128
- Oh, you are awful!
- 6.30, under the clock, Victoria Station.

598
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:02,608
All right.

599
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,452
Cross your heart and hope to die?

600
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,333
I cross my heart and hope to die.

601
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:13,004
- So long, Freda.
- So long, Shorty.

602
00:47:57,495 --> 00:47:58,769
(Clattering)

603
00:48:01,575 --> 00:48:03,088
(Whistles) Mum.

604
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:07,094
Shorty Blake!

605
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:11,607
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
and no mistake.

606
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,648
Your telegram only arrived half an hour ago.
You never said what time you was coming.

607
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:18,528
I'm here, aren't I? Sound in wind and limb.
You can't grumble.

608
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:21,009
Oh, you bad boy, you!

609
00:48:21,055 --> 00:48:23,250
May, Shorty's home!

610
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,126
Dad! Dad!

611
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,334
Doesn't he look well?

612
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,969
How's the war going, son?
See any submarines?

613
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:33,246
Hundreds. Sunk 14 last week,
and a couple of cruisers thrown in.

614
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:35,684
Oh, Mum, he's fibbing, isn't he?

615
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:38,090
In the last war, I was in a convoy once.

616
00:48:38,135 --> 00:48:39,773
Put a sock in it, Fred.

617
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:43,330
We've heard quite enough
about all what you did in the last war.

618
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,650
- Dad?
- Yes, old man?

619
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:47,367
Where did you first meet Mum?

620
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:50,883
Why, whatever made you think of asking that?

621
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:53,324
We was in a train coming back from Herne Bay.

622
00:48:54,135 --> 00:48:56,046
Well, it's a small world, and no error!

623
00:48:56,095 --> 00:48:59,451
Mum, can I leave my bridge out
while Shorty's home?

624
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:00,974
It was fate, wasn't it?

625
00:49:01,015 --> 00:49:03,927
You drink your tea up, my lad,
and don't talk so soft.

626
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,327
<i>They're coming over again.</i>

627
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:10,093
Get down. Keep your heads low.

628
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:11,727
(Aircraft flies over)

629
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:22,446
# MENDELSSOHN:
Wedding march

630
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:34,572
Now, nice and still, everybody, please.
Steady. A nice smile.

631
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:36,173
(Sobs)

632
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:38,968
It seems only yesterday he was in his pram.

633
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:42,094
Hold it!

634
00:49:42,695 --> 00:49:45,732
- Goodbye, Ma.
- Goodbye, Shorty.

635
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,972
- Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
- Good luck, old man.

636
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:57,574
Goodbye, Shorty.

637
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:02,574
Goodbye, Kath.

638
00:50:17,295 --> 00:50:18,728
Here's your little lot.

639
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:22,165
Now, then. Cheerio... Mrs Blake.

640
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:25,291
Oh, it does sound funny, doesn't it?

641
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:26,654
You'll get used to it.

642
00:50:26,695 --> 00:50:30,051
There's one thing I shall never get used to,
and that's you going away.

643
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:32,006
It's your own fault for marrying a sailor.

644
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:34,205
That's fairly asking for trouble, that is.

645
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:36,644
Can't trust any of'em an inch.
Wives in every port.

646
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:39,812
Coming home unexpected
and catching you having tea with the lodger.

647
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:43,052
I'm the one that will be the lodger
if I'm going to live with Kath.

648
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:47,486
That isn't for a whole week yet. Think of it.
Seven whole days of glorious life.

649
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,726
You'll like being with Kath, won't you?

650
00:50:50,775 --> 00:50:52,174
Of course I shall.

651
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,969
It's you being away and me wondering
what's happening to you that I won't like.

652
00:50:56,015 --> 00:50:57,846
Proceed with the following operations:

653
00:50:57,895 --> 00:51:00,648
1: Give us a kiss.
2: Chuck us another of Mum's sandwiches.

654
00:51:00,695 --> 00:51:04,131
3: Cheer up and remember this a honeymoon.
And 4: Give us another kiss.

655
00:51:04,175 --> 00:51:06,245
Now, then, ship's company...'shun!

656
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:08,809
Oh, lay off, Shorty! You're crushing my blouse.

657
00:51:08,855 --> 00:51:10,652
- Someone will see us.
- Who cares?

658
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:12,287
(Door opens)

659
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:15,087
Hello, Blake. What are you doing here?

660
00:51:15,135 --> 00:51:18,969
- I'm on my honeymoon, sir.
<i>- That's splendid. Congratulations.</i>

661
00:51:19,015 --> 00:51:21,973
Thank you, sir. This is my wife, Mrs Blake.

662
00:51:22,015 --> 00:51:24,609
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.

663
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:27,931
Alix, come and meet my shipmate and his wife.
They've just been married.

664
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:29,966
Ordinary Seaman Blake, Mrs Blake - my wife.

665
00:51:30,015 --> 00:51:33,087
- How do you do? I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thanks ever so.

666
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:36,810
But we're old friends. He practically
saved my life when I came on board.

667
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:40,325
My foot slipped on the gangway,
and I nearly fell overboard. Do you remember?

668
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:42,411
- Yes, ma'am.
- Will you live in Plymouth?

669
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:44,844
Yes... that is, when he goes to sea again.

670
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,489
Chief Petty Officer Hardy's
her uncle by marriage, sir.

671
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:50,049
She's going to live at their place for the duration.

672
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:52,768
But we're spending the next few days
in Torquay.

673
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:56,854
Very nice, too. You begin as you intend
to go on, Mrs Blake. Keep him in order.

674
00:51:56,895 --> 00:52:00,205
My wife rules me with a rod of iron.
It's been quite successful so far.

675
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:03,133
Don't talk such nonsense.
I'm never allowed to have my own way.

676
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:05,166
<i>Well, we won't interrupt you any longer.</i>

677
00:52:05,215 --> 00:52:07,012
Report him to me if he doesn't behave.

678
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:09,615
- Goodbye. The very best of luck.
- Thanks very much.

679
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:12,044
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye for the present, sir.

680
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:16,888
- Have a good time. Enjoy your leave.
- Thank you, sir.

681
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,695
Coincidence them going to Torquay
for their honeymoon.

682
00:52:20,735 --> 00:52:23,647
I thought that at the time,
but I didn't want to go on about it.

683
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:25,413
That first quarrel we had, remember?

684
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:29,130
When you went stamping off
to listen to the band and came back in tears.

685
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:31,848
It was only because they were playing
The Blue Danube.

686
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:34,329
That always makes me feel
pent-up and emotional.

687
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,935
That wasn't why you were in tears.
Don't pretend it was.

688
00:52:36,975 --> 00:52:39,933
If I was in tears at all, which I hotly deny,

689
00:52:39,975 --> 00:52:44,412
it was because that was when I discovered
what a disagreeable character you have.

690
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,969
Still, it was a good honeymoon,
as honeymoons go.

691
00:52:48,495 --> 00:52:49,894
It went awfully quickly.

692
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,049
(Whistles The Blue Danube)

693
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:58,930
Stop it, Teddy. I refuse to be made sentimental
in the middle of a Great Western lunch.

694
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:02,126
Eat up your delicious piece of railway fish
and behave yourself.

695
00:53:04,335 --> 00:53:05,734
- Damn!
- What's the matter?

696
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:08,766
<i>That thing positively haunts me.</i>

697
00:53:10,335 --> 00:53:12,610
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a show like that.

698
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:14,168
Never mind, darling.

699
00:53:15,215 --> 00:53:19,686
There'll be lots of other shows and
lots of other chances before the war's over.

700
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:27,966
(Wind howls)

701
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:40,091
Some damned poet at some time or other

702
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:44,014
wrote a very appealing little piece
about "the tiny feet of the rain".

703
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,774
There's a man I'd like to meet. I'd kill him.

704
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:50,364
Well, I'm going down to the wardroom.
Keep a stiff upper lip, old boy.

705
00:53:50,415 --> 00:53:51,643
(Laughter)

706
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,129
Five on six,

707
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:56,735
two on three,

708
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,653
and ten - just what the doctor ordered.

709
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,686
The Doctor hasn't ordered a damn thing,

710
00:54:01,735 --> 00:54:07,014
apart from a few doses of Cascara
and one splint since the ship commissioned.

711
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:10,968
That, I may say,
is what's getting the Doctor down.

712
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:16,248
Years of expensive medical training
resulting in complete atrophy.

713
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,126
The doctor wishes he was dead.

714
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,972
Someone give the Doctor a drink.

715
00:54:20,015 --> 00:54:22,848
- Mitchell, a glass of port for the Doctor.
- Thank you.

716
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:24,772
There, just the girl I wanted.

717
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:28,490
- You do have the damnedest luck.
- Skill, old boy, sheer undiluted skill.

718
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:30,253
The usual triumph of mind over matter.

719
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:32,684
- It's a stinking awful night.
- Hello, No.1.

720
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:35,044
Mitchell, a gin for the First Lieutenant.

721
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:36,244
Thanks, Torps.

722
00:54:36,295 --> 00:54:39,173
The sea is getting up
and I've got the middle watch.

723
00:54:39,215 --> 00:54:41,445
Hey, stop. You should put the ten on the nine.

724
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,645
I never noticed the damn thing!

725
00:54:43,695 --> 00:54:48,132
Here's peace, peace, perfect peace,
with loved ones far away.

726
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:55,971
- Feeling all right, old man?
- Yes. Why?

727
00:54:56,015 --> 00:54:59,132
- Sure you're not running a temperature?
- No, of course not.

728
00:54:59,175 --> 00:55:02,247
First time you haven't been late for a watch
since we commissioned.

729
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:05,810
- You're two minutes early.
- I'm sorry, sir. It won't occur again, sir.

730
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:07,686
Bearing green 3-0, vessel on fire.

731
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:17,084
(Bell)

732
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:19,684
Yes?

733
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:23,330
<i>- Captain, vessel on fire, bearing green 3-0.</i>
- Press the alarm rattlers.

734
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:24,364
(Rings)

735
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,534
Come on.

736
00:55:39,575 --> 00:55:41,566
I was dreaming I was in a Turkish harem

737
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:44,368
and some fathead
has to go and sound off action stations.

738
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:46,406
I wondered why you was pinching me.

739
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:28,005
Report to TS
when closed up and cleared away.

740
00:56:41,855 --> 00:56:43,413
Looks like a line of destroyers.

741
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:52,087
Number one gun cleared away.

742
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:54,171
Number two gun cleared away. Bore clear.

743
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:56,126
Number three gun cleared away.

744
00:56:56,175 --> 00:56:59,053
All guns closed up and cleared away.
Communications tested.

745
00:56:59,095 --> 00:57:01,131
All quarters closed up to action stations.

746
00:57:01,175 --> 00:57:04,531
- Very good. Open fire.
- Open shutter. Star shell commence.

747
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:07,806
Open shutter.
Star shell commence, commence, commence.

748
00:57:10,295 --> 00:57:12,331
Well done, guns. We've beaten them to it.

749
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:15,367
(Rapid gunfire)

750
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:16,404
(Horn)

751
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,367
They've fired now.

752
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:29,133
<i>Train right a little.</i>

753
00:57:29,175 --> 00:57:31,052
<i>Hold the leading destroyer.</i>

754
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:32,653
<i>Right, four stars.</i>

755
00:57:32,695 --> 00:57:33,684
<i>Go on!</i>

756
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:38,328
They've gone over.

757
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,366
(Guns pound)

758
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,051
(Explosion)

759
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:56,444
Go on. Stack'em up.

760
00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:11,894
<i>Go on!</i>

761
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:14,805
<i>Don't go to sleep down there. Come on.</i>

762
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:24,933
<i>Get it up</i>

763
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,006
<i>Layer on!</i>

764
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:34,046
<i>Ready</i>

765
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:42,332
We've hit. Keep it up.

766
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:44,331
- Stop star shell.
- Stop star shell.

767
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,684
Star shell check, check, check.

768
00:58:48,255 --> 00:58:49,654
We've hit again.

769
00:58:56,255 --> 00:58:57,244
(Explosion)

770
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:01,564
(Explosion)

771
00:59:04,935 --> 00:59:05,924
(Explosion)

772
00:59:08,935 --> 00:59:09,924
(Explosion)

773
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:13,804
(Explosion)

774
00:59:18,575 --> 00:59:19,974
(Explosion)

775
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:26,012
Torpedo tracks starboard, sir.

776
00:59:33,095 --> 00:59:34,767
Stop, boys, midships.

777
00:59:34,815 --> 00:59:38,330
Close all watertight doors. Jettison top weight.
Keep those guns firing.

778
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:41,367
Flags, make to Tremoyne.
Take over. Continue chase.

779
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:42,814
The power's off, sir.

780
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:48,091
Number one and number two mountings,
carry on firing.

781
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:57,930
<i>Number one and number two mountings,</i>
<i>carry on firing</i>

782
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,492
<i>Number one and number two mountings,</i>
<i>carry on firing</i>

783
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:22,730
Number one and number two mountings,
carry on firing.

784
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:40,771
<i>Number one mounting, carry on firing.</i>

785
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:27,369
- Let me know when you're ready.
<i>- Trainer on.</i>

786
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:29,804
Look out. Here she comes.

787
01:01:34,455 --> 01:01:35,854
What's the damage, No.1?

788
01:01:35,895 --> 01:01:39,365
Mess deck bulkheads are being shored up.
It looks as if they're all right.

789
01:01:39,415 --> 01:01:41,406
But there's a good deal of damage aft.

790
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:44,848
We'll be a nice sitting target when it gets light.

791
01:01:55,055 --> 01:01:56,727
Is Captain D alive?

792
01:01:57,735 --> 01:02:01,205
Yes, old chap. You haven't succeeded
to the command of this flotilla yet.

793
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:03,246
- What did you do to Jerry?
- <i>Sunk one.</i>

794
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:07,083
<i>The rest escaped in a smoke screen</i>
<i>and one was badly damaged.</i>

795
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:09,046
Not too bad.

796
01:02:09,095 --> 01:02:11,051
Tell Tancred to take me in tow.

797
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:12,494
<i>Aye aye, sir.</i>

798
01:02:13,215 --> 01:02:14,933
How far are we from home, Pilot?

799
01:02:14,975 --> 01:02:16,772
About 120 miles, sir.

800
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:20,569
Snotty, ask the First Lieutenant
if he's all ready to tow for'ard.

801
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:24,927
- We have all the guns working in hand, sir.
- Good. We shall need'em, I expect.

802
01:02:33,495 --> 01:02:35,486
Well, Blake. Don't move.

803
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:36,888
How are you feeling?

804
01:02:36,935 --> 01:02:38,573
Fine, sir, thank you.

805
01:02:38,615 --> 01:02:40,173
Got concussed a bit, didn't you?

806
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,648
Yes, sir. I think I did, sir.

807
01:02:41,695 --> 01:02:43,128
The First Lieutenant tells me

808
01:02:43,175 --> 01:02:46,212
that you stood by the gun
even when most of the crew were knocked out.

809
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:49,327
Well, sir... somebody had to do it, sir.

810
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:53,288
- You did damn well. I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you, sir.

811
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:55,803
I want to see my captain.

812
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,210
It's all right, old man. I'm here.

813
01:02:58,255 --> 01:03:00,450
Don't try to talk. Just rest.

814
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:08,244
(Explosion)

815
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,414
(Rapid gunfire)

816
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:29,212
Are the bulkheads holding all right?

817
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:31,371
Yes, sir, they're taking it very well.

818
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:35,012
How far have we made good the last two days?

819
01:03:35,055 --> 01:03:36,852
We're about halfway there, sir.

820
01:04:00,015 --> 01:04:01,573
The RAF ought to be here soon.

821
01:04:01,615 --> 01:04:04,891
A nice nippy little fighter squadron,
that's what we want.

822
01:04:04,935 --> 01:04:07,290
- I wish they'd get a move on.
- Give'em time, old boy.

823
01:04:07,335 --> 01:04:10,327
I'm sick of wallowing about here
like a sitting duck.

824
01:04:28,215 --> 01:04:31,173

826
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:49,093
Bravo!

827
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,124
Hooray!

828

(Cheering)

829
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:03,447
Make yourselves comfortable.
We're all pretty tired.

830
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:05,486
There are one or two things I want to say.

831
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,729
First...

832
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:10,694
First, I'll hold
a short memorial service next Sunday

833
01:05:10,735 --> 01:05:13,408
for our 36 shipmates who lost their lives,

834
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:17,846
and return thanks that the old ship
came through with so many of her complement.

835
01:05:17,895 --> 01:05:21,854
I expect that Hitler is conferring the Iron Cross
on the man who claims to have sunk us.

836
01:05:23,815 --> 01:05:26,852
Secondly, I want to tell you
that you all did pretty well

837
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:29,204
in the trying time we've been through.

838
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:32,008
When a torpedo hits
so small a ship as a destroyer,

839
01:05:32,055 --> 01:05:35,092
the result is bound to be fairly devastating,
if not fatal.

840
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:37,854
And I can understand
the tremendous temptation

841
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:41,092
to think of your own skin first
and the ship and your shipmates second.

842
01:05:41,135 --> 01:05:46,368
I suppose, in a way, it's gratifying to feel
that out of a ship's company of 244 men,

843
01:05:46,415 --> 01:05:50,328
243 have behaved
as I hoped and expected they would.

844
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,172
One man, however, did not.

845
01:05:54,935 --> 01:05:58,928
<i>That man has been charged</i>
<i>with leaving his post without permission.</i>

846
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:02,684
<i>I needn't tell you how serious</i>
<i>an offence of this nature is in time of war,</i>

847
01:06:02,735 --> 01:06:05,408
<i>nor how drastic is the punishment</i>
<i>that normally follows.</i>

848
01:06:05,455 --> 01:06:09,971
You will be surprised, therefore, to learn
that I have let him off with a caution.

849
01:06:10,015 --> 01:06:12,654
Or perhaps I should say with two cautions -

850
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:15,493
one to him, and one to me.

851
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:18,129
For in a way,
I feel that what happened was my fault.

852
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:22,167
<i>This man has only been in the Navy</i>
<i>for six months.</i>

853
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:24,410
<i>He has only been in this ship for two months.</i>

854
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:27,970
<i>Even so I feel that in that time</i>
<i>I should have been able to make it clear to him</i>

855
01:06:28,015 --> 01:06:31,371
<i>that I did not expect</i>
<i>and would not tolerate such behaviour.</i>

856
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:36,205
I feel I should have been able to get at least
that much of my creed across, but I failed.

857
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:42,964
<i>I will not punish a man for an action</i>
<i>for which I must hold myself largely to blame.</i>

858
01:06:44,415 --> 01:06:48,727
<i>But I should like you all to know</i>
<i>that after this, there will be no more cautions.</i>

859
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:51,013
The next time we run into trouble -

860
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:54,730
and as leader of a striking force,
this ship's bound to be in more scraps -

861
01:06:54,775 --> 01:06:59,326
I know that, come what may,
no-one will fail to do his duty to the very end.

862
01:07:01,535 --> 01:07:04,333
Thank you all for making my task so easy,

863
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,764
and the Torrin a ship to be so very proud of.

864
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:10,250

It's after hours.

869

What's the matter with having some music?

870
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:14,329
If you've got a penny, you can have it.
If not, you can't.

871
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,649
I have.

872
01:08:15,695 --> 01:08:18,971
Well, put it in the slot, then.
That's what it's there for.

873
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:20,209
I will.

before we close?

876
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:40,813
Look here, miss. Judging by all
I've had tonight, I ought to be drunk, see.

877
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,334
I want to be drunk.

- Cheerio, Kath.
- Be good.

911

Go on, Freda. Go on up to the gate with him.
I'll wait here.

912
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,571
You shouldn't have come. It's bad for you.

Don't be silly.
It would be much worse sitting at home.

you can always go to Dorothy's.

- A Daimler.

I suppose you think that's old-fashioned.

930
01:12:51,655 --> 01:12:54,533
Well, so it is,
compared to a snappy 1940 Packard.

931
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:57,965
You couldn't have the King
whizzing along the streets in a flash roadster.

932

Who said anything about roadsters?

933
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:02,892
I said before, and I'll say it again,
there is nothing on land or sea

934
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:05,210
to touch a good old conservative British make.

935
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,574
Give me a Daimler every time.

936
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:10,688
You wanted a Rolls-Royce just now.
You can't have both. Looks like profiteering.

- Look here, old man...
- Oh, give it a rest.

we've been escorting a convoy of'em.

Anybody seen the Chief
after the royal raspberry he got this morning?

943
01:13:44,615 --> 01:13:47,766
- Poor old Chiefy.
- He hasn't been in to lunch yet.

944
01:13:47,815 --> 01:13:50,887
- Hello, Chief. We were just talking about you.
- Damned nice of you.

945
01:13:50,935 --> 01:13:54,132
- Made any more filthy vapours?
- Shut up, Guns. I've had enough of that.

946
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:58,487
I thought it looked very attractive, all that
dense black smoke belching from the funnel.

947
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:01,254

- Never mind, Chiefy.

about the war?

01:14:09,255 --> 01:14:11,052
Not since yesterday. Pretty bad show.

He wasn't far from GHQ in Arras.

953
01:14:14,335 --> 01:14:17,247
- God knows where he is now.
- The whole thing's been a lash-up.

don't you?

<i>But the soldiers are our brothers in arms</i>

958
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,047
<i>and it's up to us to get'em off</i>
<i>so they can live to fight again.</i>

959
01:14:36,095 --> 01:14:40,532
Let them see how much we admire
the way they fought. And don't forget,

960
01:14:40,575 --> 01:14:44,648
the success of our evacuation is measured
by the smallness of the military casualties,

961
01:14:44,695 --> 01:14:46,094
not the naval ones.

962
01:14:47,095 --> 01:14:51,134

987
01:16:12,695 --> 01:16:16,574
How's the old country looking now?
I feel as if I've been away for years.

988
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:18,810
We've been away quite a while, too.

989
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:21,130
We put in up north every now and again
to refuel.

990
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:24,167
The country's looking much the same as usual
the last time I saw it.

991
01:16:24,215 --> 01:16:27,525
Gentle, you know. Not exactly smug,
but not exactly warlike, either.

992
01:16:27,575 --> 01:16:29,133
There'll always be an England, eh?

993
01:16:29,175 --> 01:16:31,291
S u bboso t h at's as good a convv ct o n as a ny

994
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:33,724
- A good deal better than most, sir.
- What?

995
01:16:33,775 --> 01:16:37,085
A good deal better than most...
(Drowned out by dive bomber)

996
01:16:41,015 --> 01:16:43,245
Here you are, chum.
Here's a nice cup of cocoa.

997
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:44,933
Want a biscuit?

998
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,170
Go on, leave it. He might fancy it later.

999
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:52,010
I never thought I'd be so glad
to see a cup of cocoa.

1000
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:53,727
That's right, chum, have another go.

1001
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,606
Come on, it's better with your boots off.

1002
01:16:55,655 --> 01:16:57,850
What a swallow! Lovely. Have some more.

1003
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:01,893
We're getting quite close.
Good old white cliffs of Dover.

1004
01:17:01,935 --> 01:17:04,813
Look better with the sun on them.
Still, can't have everything.

1005
01:17:04,855 --> 01:17:07,085
- Damned lucky to see them at all.
- Quite right.

1006
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:10,730
Haven't had a chance to thank you, Kinross.
The Navy's put up a fine show.

1007
01:17:10,775 --> 01:17:12,652
I hope you don't think we're not grateful.

1008
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:15,414
- Perhaps you'd care to dine one night.
- Thanks. I'd love to.

1009
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:18,288
We'd better get below, Jasper,
and start lining up the troops.

1010
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:20,974
I expect you'll be wanting to push off
as soon as possible.

1011
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:22,653
You've struck rather a busy day.

1012
01:17:22,695 --> 01:17:25,573
- Goodbye for the present.
- Forgive me for not coming down.

1013
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:29,369
- Goodbye, sir. Thanks very much.
- Goodbye. Good luck.

1014
01:17:29,415 --> 01:17:33,090
- Just ordinary Bovril and sherry?
- Just ordinary Bovril and sherry.

1015
01:17:33,135 --> 01:17:34,614
Good. Thanks.

1016
01:19:26,295 --> 01:19:28,411
Battalion... sling your arms.

1017
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:35,764
Battalion...

1018
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,607
...'shun!

1019
01:19:38,655 --> 01:19:41,613
<i>Turn to the left in threes.</i>

1020
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,727
Left... turn.

1021
01:19:46,855 --> 01:19:48,766
By the right, quick march.

1022
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:50,726
Left, right, left, right.

1023
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:03,011
If I wasn't so tired, I'd give them a cheer.
And that's no error.

1024
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,810
Ready to slip, No.1?

1025
01:20:29,855 --> 01:20:31,129
<i>All ready, sir.</i>

1026
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:33,174
Let go aft.

1027
01:20:34,055 --> 01:20:35,693
Hold on to your spring, for'ard.

1028
01:20:35,735 --> 01:20:37,293
Slow ahead, Starboard Pilot.

1029
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,767
You'd never think there was a war on.

1030
01:20:55,815 --> 01:20:58,613
But there isn't. Not just for a minute, that is.

1031
01:20:58,655 --> 01:21:00,373
We've got five more whole days.

1032
01:21:02,455 --> 01:21:04,207
Flat calm.

1033
01:21:04,255 --> 01:21:05,893
Looks like a piece of grey silk.

1034
01:21:05,935 --> 01:21:07,493
My auntie had a dress that colour,

1035
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,845
and she sent it to the cleaner's
and it come back all spotty.

1036
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:17,413
Funny to think this is such a little island,
isn't it?

1037
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:20,924
Mm.

1038
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:32,050
He's got France now,
and France is only 20 miles from England.

1039
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,734
Makes you think, don't it?

1040
01:21:37,615 --> 01:21:40,129
Mummy, Trafalgar won't eat sausage roll.

1041
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,643
That's because you spoil him so dreadfully.

1042
01:21:42,695 --> 01:21:45,163
Look, Bobby. That one diving is a Hurricane.

1043
01:21:48,335 --> 01:21:52,214
No, it isn't, Dad. It's an ME 109,
like the one they brought down last Tuesday.

1044
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:54,132
Don't speak with your mouth full.

1045
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:01,971
What a perfectly lovely day it's been.

1046
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:04,774
Lovely for us, I mean.

1047
01:22:04,815 --> 01:22:07,807
- I suppose that's very selfish of me, isn't it?
- Extremely.

1048
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:11,530
I can't believe it's so dreadfully wrong
to forget the war now and again...

1049
01:22:11,575 --> 01:22:12,974
when one can, just for a little.

1050
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:17,691
I think it's very clever of you, with all hell
breaking loose over our defenceless heads.

1051
01:22:17,735 --> 01:22:21,614
I made the most tremendous effort
and pretended it wasn't real at all.

1052
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:24,328
They were toys having a mock battle
just to keep us amused.

1053
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,333
That's the most shameful confession.
Sheer escapism.

1054
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,774
I don't care.

1055
01:22:29,815 --> 01:22:32,090
It has been a lovely day.

1056
01:22:32,135 --> 01:22:37,084
The sun's been shining and the country
looks so green and sweet and peaceful.

1057
01:22:37,135 --> 01:22:40,844
And you are on leave,
even if it's only till the day after tomorrow.

1058
01:22:41,935 --> 01:22:45,291
Teddy, I wonder where we shall all be
this time next year.

1059
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:48,293
A lot might happen between now
and this time next year.

1060
01:22:50,415 --> 01:22:51,689
(Guard's whistle)

1061
01:22:53,655 --> 01:22:55,566
Take care of yourself, my darling.

1062
01:22:55,615 --> 01:22:57,810
It was a good honeymoon while it lasted.

1063
01:23:15,855 --> 01:23:18,813
Tweedledee smiled gently and began again.

1064
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:24,571
The sun was shining on the sea,
shining with all his might.

1065
01:23:24,615 --> 01:23:28,290
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright.

1066
01:23:36,135 --> 01:23:38,365
This cocoa gets thicker and thicker every night.

1067
01:23:38,415 --> 01:23:40,610
It's warming, anyhow, sir. Lines the stomach.

1068
01:23:40,655 --> 01:23:42,566
Well, it's practically porridge.

1069
01:23:44,095 --> 01:23:45,687
There goes another lot, sir.

1070
01:23:48,495 --> 01:23:51,055
Looks as if poor old Plymouth's
going to get it again.

1071
01:23:54,135 --> 01:23:56,285
Well, I will say one thing for that bit of fish.

1072
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:58,929
There may not have been much of it,
but it was tasty.

1073
01:23:58,975 --> 01:24:01,489
It's that Mr Morgan. He always favours us.

1074
01:24:01,535 --> 01:24:03,253
It's Freda that gets round him.

1075
01:24:03,295 --> 01:24:07,049
The moment we got into the shop,
up he comes with a chair as if we was royalty.

1076
01:24:07,095 --> 01:24:09,973
Oh, he's all right,
if only he wasn't quite so nosy.

1077
01:24:10,015 --> 01:24:12,404
- How are you feeling, dear?
- Fine, thank you.

1078
01:24:12,455 --> 01:24:14,286
Did that letter from Shorty cheer you up?

1079
01:24:14,335 --> 01:24:17,532
I wish he was home,
and I wish that ship would get a bit damaged,

1080
01:24:17,575 --> 01:24:21,932
not so that anyone was hurt, mind you,
but just so as he could get a little bit of leave.

1081
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:25,092
Never mind, dear.
Men must work and women must weep.

1082
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:26,693
That's what I always say.

1083
01:24:26,735 --> 01:24:29,852
That sink's stopped up again.
It never rains but it pours.

1084
01:24:29,895 --> 01:24:31,294
We'd better get Mr Luton in.

1085
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:34,407
He was blitzed out last week.
Don't know where he's moved to.

1086
01:24:34,455 --> 01:24:37,413
- Anybody seen my scissors?
- Yes, I've got them. Here they are.

1087
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:38,808
(Air-raid siren)

1088
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:40,811
Oh, here they are again!

1089
01:24:41,855 --> 01:24:43,846
Bit later than they were last night.

1090
01:24:46,575 --> 01:24:48,566
(Siren continues)

1091
01:24:58,655 --> 01:25:00,964
I wish you'd go down to the shelter, Freda.

1092
01:25:01,015 --> 01:25:03,085
Please don't start all that again, Auntie.

1093
01:25:03,135 --> 01:25:06,252
You know I hate being shut up down there.
It makes me feel sick.

1094
01:25:06,295 --> 01:25:08,331
I'd much rather stay up here, I would really.

1095
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,491
<i>But in your condition, I honestly think...</i>

1096
01:25:10,535 --> 01:25:12,651
<i>It's no use, Mother. Leave her alone.</i>

1097
01:25:12,695 --> 01:25:14,970
It's all very fine you being calm and collected,

1098
01:25:15,015 --> 01:25:19,372
but I'll tell you one thing here and now,
my nerves won't stand much more of this.

1099
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:22,327
You can go down to the shelter.
Nobody's stopping you.

1100
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:26,414
Try as I may, I can't understand why
you won't shut up the house and evacuate.

1101
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,764
I've told you why till I'm blue in the face.

1102
01:25:28,815 --> 01:25:31,010
(Footsteps outside)

1103
01:25:31,055 --> 01:25:33,330
When you could go away somewhere quiet,

1104
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:36,094
it seems just plain silly to sit here and ask for it.

1105
01:25:36,135 --> 01:25:39,013
Could go away! Where, I should like to know?

1106
01:25:39,055 --> 01:25:42,331
Well, there's Dorothy for a start.
She's got a spare room.

1107
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:44,206
Thank you for nothing. I've slept in it.

1108
01:25:44,255 --> 01:25:46,086
It may be a bit poky, but it's safe.

1109
01:25:46,135 --> 01:25:49,730
Once and for all, Mother, will you
do me a favour and shut up about this?

1110
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:51,731
I've told you how I feel and that's that.

1111
01:25:51,775 --> 01:25:55,734
This is Walter's home, and he expects
to find me in it when he comes back on leave.

1112
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:58,335
What do you suppose he'd think
if he turned up unexpected

1113
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:01,333
and found the house locked up
and me hiding in the country?

1114
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:03,935
He might only have a few hours.
That'd be a nice thing.

1115
01:26:03,975 --> 01:26:06,409
You could let him know where we were,
couldn't you?

1116
01:26:06,455 --> 01:26:09,652
Oh, it's "we" now, is it?
I thought there was a catch in it.

1117
01:26:09,695 --> 01:26:13,688
Kathleen Hardy, how can you say such a thing
to your own mother?

1118
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,134
(Bomb whistles)

1119
01:26:21,975 --> 01:26:24,330
Well, I'm sorry,
but you make me tired sometimes.

1120
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:27,333
I'm sure I'm only trying to be sensible.

1121
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:31,493
What about the garden and Walter's bulbs
that he's so proud of? Who'd look after them?

1122
01:26:31,535 --> 01:26:35,323
Bulbs don't need any looking after.
They just come up.

1123
01:26:37,935 --> 01:26:39,448
(Bomb whistles)

1124
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:40,484
(Explosion)

1125
01:26:40,535 --> 01:26:44,687
Come on, Freda. Under the stairs you go.
Your chair's all ready for you.

1126
01:26:44,735 --> 01:26:46,327
Oh, I'm all right here, Kath.

1127
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:48,764
Just do as you're told, there's a good girl.

1128
01:26:48,815 --> 01:26:51,932
We'll leave the door open like we did before
so you won't feel lonely.

1129
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:54,933
- Oh, Kath!
- Come on. I'll bring your sewing.

1130
01:26:54,975 --> 01:26:56,886
The light's quite good in the hall.

1131
01:27:03,535 --> 01:27:05,446
(Rumbling)

1132
01:27:05,495 --> 01:27:06,894
(Explosion)

1133
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:09,767
<i>That sounds like a land mine.</i>

1134
01:27:09,815 --> 01:27:13,967
<i>No, just an ordinary HE.</i>
<i>Land mines make more of a rumble.</i>

1135
01:27:14,015 --> 01:27:15,926
(Rumbling)

1136
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:18,489
I don't like it, Kathleen.
It's no use pretending I do.

1137
01:27:18,535 --> 01:27:20,287
I know you don't, Mother. Nobody does.

1138
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:22,929
But there's no use in making a fuss, is there?

1139
01:27:22,975 --> 01:27:26,365
Cheer up, there's a dear.
Are you all right, Freda?

1140
01:27:26,415 --> 01:27:27,609
Yes, thanks.

1141
01:27:27,655 --> 01:27:30,453
<i>If you're cold, I can run up</i>
<i>and get you an eiderdown</i>

1142
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,053
I'm quite warm.

1143
01:27:32,095 --> 01:27:35,565
<i>We'll have some tea in a minute, anyway,</i>
<i>just to keep us going.</i>

1144
01:27:35,615 --> 01:27:38,493
(Bombs whistling)

1145
01:27:41,015 --> 01:27:42,209
(Explosion)

1146
01:28:03,255 --> 01:28:05,007
Right you are. Back.

1147
01:28:05,055 --> 01:28:06,170
Carefully, now.

1148
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:07,728
Whoa. Back. Slow.

1149
01:28:07,775 --> 01:28:09,447
Whoa. Whoa.

1150
01:28:18,615 --> 01:28:20,492
(Explosion)

1151
01:28:21,495 --> 01:28:23,486
(Explosion)

1152
01:28:34,655 --> 01:28:36,373
Tell Walter...

1153
01:28:38,175 --> 01:28:40,450
Tell him I didn't want to leave the house.

1154
01:28:54,175 --> 01:28:55,767
(Footsteps)

1155
01:28:58,215 --> 01:28:59,614
Nurse?

1156
01:29:01,215 --> 01:29:02,204
Nurse!

1157
01:29:05,335 --> 01:29:07,053
Is it all over?

1158
01:29:07,095 --> 01:29:08,687
Yes, dear.

1159
01:29:08,735 --> 01:29:10,965
It's all over. Don't worry.

1160
01:29:11,015 --> 01:29:12,733
Mother and child doing well.

1161
01:29:20,695 --> 01:29:22,686
(Air-raid siren)

1162
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:43,884
This is the fourth time in three months
we've put into this dead-and-alive hole.

1163
01:29:43,935 --> 01:29:46,051
Don't worry, cock. We'll be off again tonight.

1164
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:49,610
I know. There's no need to rub it in.
But I'm chock-a-block with this place.

1165
01:29:49,655 --> 01:29:51,964
Well, where could you go
if you could get ashore?

1166
01:29:52,015 --> 01:29:56,964
Look at it. Nowt but sheep and seagulls.
Not even a tree.

1167
01:29:57,015 --> 01:29:59,848
What do you expect in the north of Scotland?
A blinkin' casino?

1168
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:03,649
There must be one bottle of beer in Scotland.
Just one wonderful bottle of beer.

1169
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:05,492
Well, here comes Posty, anyway.

1170
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:10,324
Edgecombe, Blake...
There you are, Shorty. Hollett.

1171
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:12,684
Stick it on the table, will you?
My hands are wet.

1172
01:30:12,735 --> 01:30:15,454
- I expect it's a bill from my tailor.
- Mackeridge.

1173
01:30:15,495 --> 01:30:17,008
- Only one?
- That's right.

1174
01:30:18,015 --> 01:30:19,414
It's from my young sister.

1175
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:22,925
After months on the North ruddy Sea,
all I get is a letter from my young sister.

1176
01:30:22,975 --> 01:30:24,852
Shut up grumbling for a bit, can't you?

1177
01:30:24,895 --> 01:30:26,453
Cheer up. It may be bad news.

1178
01:30:26,495 --> 01:30:28,372
- <i>Oh, dear, more trouble.</i>
- What's up?

1179
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:31,373
Some fathead left the coal hole open.
My old woman fell down it.

1180
01:30:31,415 --> 01:30:33,133
(Laughter)

1181
01:30:33,175 --> 01:30:34,847
Joey! Joey!

1182
01:30:35,775 --> 01:30:39,165
It's come. The baby's come.
It weighs 7lb and it's a boy.

1183
01:30:39,215 --> 01:30:40,887
Here, listen to what she says.

1184
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:42,971
"It was born in the middle of a blitz..."

1185
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:49,287
What's the matter?

1186
01:30:52,095 --> 01:30:53,323
Kath Hardy.

1187
01:30:54,055 --> 01:30:55,568
Kath and her mother.

1188
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:59,492
- The whole house went and they got killed.
- Mrs Hardy?

1189
01:31:00,975 --> 01:31:03,569
Yes. My missus was living with them,
you know.

1190
01:31:07,255 --> 01:31:08,813
I wonder if anybody's told him.

1191
01:31:09,855 --> 01:31:11,766
They hadn't got any kids, had they?

1192
01:31:13,095 --> 01:31:14,767
No, they ain't got no kids.

1193
01:31:18,255 --> 01:31:19,404
Well...

1194
01:31:20,855 --> 01:31:23,449
I suppose I'd better go and see if I can find him.

1195
01:32:05,575 --> 01:32:06,974
Hello, Shorty.

1196
01:32:08,775 --> 01:32:12,893
I er... just popped along
to see if you had any news from home.

1197
01:32:12,935 --> 01:32:16,007
Not so much as a postcard,
but that's Kath all over.

1198
01:32:16,055 --> 01:32:19,650
All the years we've been married,
I've never known her get a post right yet.

1199
01:32:19,695 --> 01:32:21,572
Have you heard from Freda?

1200
01:32:21,615 --> 01:32:23,207
- Yeah.
- How's she doing?

1201
01:32:25,015 --> 01:32:26,414
She's all right.

1202
01:32:29,495 --> 01:32:31,087
Why, what's the matter?

1203
01:32:32,735 --> 01:32:34,134
It's Kath, Walter.

1204
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:35,654
She and Mrs Lemmon.

1205
01:32:37,055 --> 01:32:38,374
You see...

1206
01:32:39,455 --> 01:32:43,448
They was all in the house together and...
it got blitzed.

1207
01:32:44,135 --> 01:32:45,727
What do you mean?

1208
01:32:46,855 --> 01:32:48,413
Kath got killed.

1209
01:32:48,455 --> 01:32:50,207
Both of them did.

1210
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:53,847
Freda was all right. She...

1211
01:32:54,615 --> 01:32:56,412
She was under the stairs.

1212
01:33:01,575 --> 01:33:02,974
Oh, I see.

1213
01:33:04,975 --> 01:33:06,203
So, er...

1214
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:11,408
I thought I'd better come along and tell you,
seeing that...

1215
01:33:11,455 --> 01:33:14,447
Thanks, son. I'm much obliged.
I'm much obliged.

1216
01:33:19,535 --> 01:33:21,730
I think I'll just go out on deck for a bit.

1217
01:33:22,975 --> 01:33:23,964
Righto.

1218
01:33:30,495 --> 01:33:34,283
- I'm glad Freda's all right.
- Yes, she's fine. We er...

1219
01:33:35,415 --> 01:33:36,814
We've got a son.

1220
01:33:38,575 --> 01:33:39,769
I'm glad.

1221
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:42,489
Congratulations.

1222
01:33:54,215 --> 01:33:55,694
(Seagulls cry)

1223
01:34:29,695 --> 01:34:31,174
She's going, sir.

1224
01:34:35,975 --> 01:34:38,364
Three cheers for the ship.

1225
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:41,366
Hip, hip, hooray!

1226
01:34:41,815 --> 01:34:44,966
<i>Hi hi hooray!</i>

1227
01:34:45,415 --> 01:34:46,530
(Aircraft approaches)

1228
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:48,566
Look out. They're coming again.

1229
01:35:33,615 --> 01:35:37,290
Dark object floating off starboard bow, sir.
Looks like a raft.

1230
01:35:37,335 --> 01:35:39,769
You're right, Yeoman.
Stand by to pick up survivors.

1231
01:35:39,815 --> 01:35:41,214
Aye aye, sir.

1232
01:35:45,135 --> 01:35:47,126
(Coughing and spluttering)

1233
01:35:53,015 --> 01:35:56,007
Keep up your spirits.
I believe they've arrived at last.

1234
01:35:56,055 --> 01:35:58,046
(All shout)

1235
01:35:59,175 --> 01:36:01,814
Looks like one of the old flotilla.

1236
01:36:03,535 --> 01:36:04,524
(Cheering)

1237
01:36:04,575 --> 01:36:07,248
(Joey plays Roll Out The Barrel)

1238
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:09,968
# We'll have a barrel of fun

1239
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,688
# Roll out the barrel

1240
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:16,808

1242

(Ship's siren)

1243
01:36:33,495 --> 01:36:34,689
Thank you.

1244
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:41,889
- I'm damned glad to see you, sir.
- Thanks, No.1.

1245
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:44,005
Captain sends his compliments, sir.

1246
01:36:44,055 --> 01:36:48,685
Thank you. Tell him from me, I warned him.
He won't get command of this flotilla yet.

1247
01:36:48,735 --> 01:36:50,885
It was an extraordinary bit of luck finding you.

1248
01:36:50,935 --> 01:36:53,574
The Chief Yeoman spotted you.
We were about to give up.

1249
01:36:53,615 --> 01:36:57,403
- How many of my men have you picked up?
- 90, sir. Some are badly knocked about.

1250
01:36:57,455 --> 01:36:59,047
- Where are they?
- Between decks.

1251
01:36:59,095 --> 01:37:01,768
- The dive-bombing's been pretty incessant.
(Alarm)

1252
01:37:03,495 --> 01:37:06,373
Here we go again. Anybody got any Flit?

1253
01:37:06,415 --> 01:37:10,203
- Anybody happen to know where we're going?
- Alexandria, I expect.

1254
01:37:10,255 --> 01:37:11,893
Join the Navy and see the world.

1255
01:37:11,935 --> 01:37:14,085
Looks to me as if it's going to be the next world.

1256
01:37:16,375 --> 01:37:17,888
It's all right. Don't move.

1257
01:37:17,935 --> 01:37:19,926
(Dive bomber approaches)

1258
01:37:24,735 --> 01:37:27,010
- Glad you're OK, sir.
- Thanks, Fisher.

1259
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:30,251
We were getting a bit worried about you, sir.

1260
01:37:30,295 --> 01:37:33,446
- Nothing like a good swim before breakfast.
- That's right, sir.

1261
01:37:42,535 --> 01:37:45,003
Snotty, give me a piece of paper and a pencil.

1262
01:37:52,015 --> 01:37:54,927
It's... No.17.

1263
01:37:57,215 --> 01:38:00,207
Just as you turn out of...
turn out of the high street.

1264
01:38:01,735 --> 01:38:05,364
All right. I've got the address straight.
I'll let her know.

1265
01:38:06,415 --> 01:38:07,609
Thank you, sir.

1266
01:38:31,855 --> 01:38:33,254
All right, son.

1267
01:38:42,975 --> 01:38:45,443
Try it a little louder, son. I can't quite hear.

1268
01:38:48,175 --> 01:38:53,693
24... Gr... Greek Street.

1269
01:39:01,095 --> 01:39:05,168
All right. Don't worry.
I'll write and tell them they can be proud of you.

1270
01:39:12,215 --> 01:39:14,206
(Bomb whistles)

1271
01:39:14,255 --> 01:39:16,166
(Explosion)

1272
01:39:16,215 --> 01:39:20,527
Of all the persistent bastards!
You'd think they'd get tired, wouldn't you?

1273
01:39:20,575 --> 01:39:24,011
I'll tell you something -
strictly between you and I -

1274
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:26,615
I'm scared stiff,
and it's no good pretending I'm not.

1275
01:39:26,655 --> 01:39:28,646
If I could be at a gun, I shouldn't mind,

1276
01:39:28,695 --> 01:39:31,926
but this sitting about and asking for it
is beginning to get me down.

1277
01:39:31,975 --> 01:39:35,854
- Brace up. Remember Nelson.
- Yeah, look what happened to him.

1278
01:39:35,895 --> 01:39:37,931
(Bomb whistles down)

1279
01:39:39,055 --> 01:39:42,331
(Barrel organ plays

1282
01:40:07,535 --> 01:40:08,524
(Doorbell)

1283
01:40:08,575 --> 01:40:09,974
Oh, all right!

1284
01:40:18,655 --> 01:40:21,328
- Name of Blake?
- Yes, name of Blake.

1285
01:40:21,375 --> 01:40:23,093
- Here you are, then.
- Thanks.

1286
01:40:33,135 --> 01:40:35,091
There's no answer.

1287
01:40:35,135 --> 01:40:36,124
(Sobs)

1288
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:39,605
<i>Freda! Dad! Freda! May!</i>

1289

<i>He's safe! He's all right! He's safe!</i>

1290
01:40:43,815 --> 01:40:45,806
He's safe, Freda! He's safe!

1291
01:40:45,855 --> 01:40:47,334
He's all right! He's safe!

1292
01:40:48,655 --> 01:40:51,488
- What is it? It's not...
- It's from him.

1293
01:40:51,535 --> 01:40:54,254
He's sent a telegram. It's from him himself.

1294
01:40:54,295 --> 01:40:57,571
He's all right. My boy's all right.

1295
01:40:57,615 --> 01:41:00,288
But the ship went down.
It said so in the papers.

1296
01:41:00,335 --> 01:41:01,324
Ook

1297
01:41:06,935 --> 01:41:08,846
OK... love.

1298
01:41:14,975 --> 01:41:19,253
There, there, dear.
There isn't nothing to cry about no more.

1299
01:41:22,015 --> 01:41:23,607
Shall I wait for an answer?

1300
01:41:23,655 --> 01:41:26,123
Oh... Just a minute, I'll see.

1301
01:41:26,175 --> 01:41:28,325
Can we go down to the village after tea,
Mummy?

1302
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,809
- I want to go on my bicycle.
- I want to go on mine, too.

1303
01:41:30,855 --> 01:41:35,087
- You can't. You've got a flat tyre.
- But I'm going to pump it up again.

1304
01:41:35,135 --> 01:41:37,410
The girl's waiting for an answer, ma'am.

1305
01:41:55,255 --> 01:41:56,734
There's no answer.

1306
01:41:58,535 --> 01:42:01,891
Tell Mrs Bates and John it's from the Captain
and everything's all right.

1307
01:42:01,935 --> 01:42:05,530
- I'm so glad, ma'am.
<i>- Thank you, Emily.</i>

1308
01:42:11,855 --> 01:42:13,493
Darlings, it's from Daddy.

1309
01:42:14,655 --> 01:42:16,930
He was picked up and taken to Alexandria.

1310
01:42:17,935 --> 01:42:19,254
He's quite safe.

1311
01:42:19,295 --> 01:42:21,729
Oh, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy!

1312
01:42:35,295 --> 01:42:36,853
Ship's company...'shun!

1313
01:42:37,695 --> 01:42:39,686
Ship's company present, sir.

1314
01:42:39,735 --> 01:42:42,090
Thank you, Torps. Stand them easy, please.

1315
01:42:42,135 --> 01:42:44,649
Ship's company, stand at ease!

1316
01:42:45,695 --> 01:42:47,094
Stand easy.

1317
01:42:53,815 --> 01:42:55,407
Come a little closer.

1318
01:43:04,215 --> 01:43:07,491
I have come to say goodbye
to the few of you who are left.

1319
01:43:09,095 --> 01:43:11,768
We've had so many talks, and this is our last.

1320
01:43:13,135 --> 01:43:15,444
I've always tried to crack a joke or two before,

1321
01:43:15,495 --> 01:43:19,010
and you've all been friendly
and laughed at them.

1322
01:43:19,055 --> 01:43:22,013
But today, I'm afraid I've run out of jokes,

1323
01:43:23,815 --> 01:43:26,887
and I don't suppose any of us
feels much like laughing.

1324
01:43:29,215 --> 01:43:31,285
The Torrin has been in one scrap after another,

1325
01:43:31,335 --> 01:43:36,648
but even when we had men killed, the majority
survived and brought the old ship back.

1326
01:43:38,935 --> 01:43:40,846
Now she lies in 1500 fathoms...

1327
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:44,564
...and with her, more than half our shipmates.

1328
01:43:46,855 --> 01:43:49,244
If they had to die, what a grand way to go.

1329
01:43:50,695 --> 01:43:53,653
For now they lie all together
with the ship we loved,

1330
01:43:53,695 --> 01:43:55,572
and they're in very good company.

1331
01:43:55,615 --> 01:43:59,847
<i>We've lost her, but they're still with her.</i>

1332
01:44:02,935 --> 01:44:05,210
There may be less than half the Torrin left,

1333
01:44:05,975 --> 01:44:10,526
but I feel that we'll all take up the battle
with even stronger heart.

1334
01:44:12,535 --> 01:44:15,732
Each of us knows
twice as much about fighting,

1335
01:44:15,775 --> 01:44:18,494
and each of us
has twice as good a reason to fight.

1336
01:44:20,615 --> 01:44:24,528
You will all be sent to replace men
who have been killed in other ships.

1337
01:44:26,775 --> 01:44:29,573
And the next time you're in action,

1338
01:44:29,615 --> 01:44:31,014
remember the Torrin.

1339
01:44:36,655 --> 01:44:38,373
I should like to add...

1340
01:44:40,135 --> 01:44:46,654
...that there isn't one of you that I wouldn't be
proud and honoured to serve with again.

1341
01:44:50,495 --> 01:44:51,484
Goodbye.

1342
01:44:52,895 --> 01:44:54,169
Good luck.

1343
01:44:56,655 --> 01:44:59,123
And thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

1344
01:45:09,135 --> 01:45:10,648
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1345
01:45:13,295 --> 01:45:14,284
Goodbye.

1346
01:45:15,775 --> 01:45:17,766
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1347
01:45:18,775 --> 01:45:20,003
Goodbye, sir.

1348
01:45:20,055 --> 01:45:21,568
Goodbye, Rawlings.

1349
01:45:23,215 --> 01:45:24,728
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1350
01:45:26,335 --> 01:45:27,609
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1351
01:45:29,655 --> 01:45:31,088
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1352
01:45:32,815 --> 01:45:35,124
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thanks, Harris. Goodbye.

1353
01:45:36,135 --> 01:45:38,330
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

1354
01:45:39,655 --> 01:45:41,168
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

1355
01:45:42,615 --> 01:45:44,526
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

1356
01:45:44,575 --> 01:45:46,452
- Best of luck, sir.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

1357
01:45:46,495 --> 01:45:48,213
Goodbye, sir. The very best of luck.

1358
01:45:49,935 --> 01:45:51,527
Thanks, Roach. Goodbye.

1359
01:45:52,455 --> 01:45:55,367
- The very best of luck, sir.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

1360
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:57,485
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Fisher.

1361
01:45:58,615 --> 01:46:00,207
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Moran.

1362
01:46:01,215 --> 01:46:03,809
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Hollett.

1363
01:46:03,855 --> 01:46:06,494
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Edgecombe.

1364
01:46:08,415 --> 01:46:10,133
Goodbye, sir. Bon voyage.

1365
01:46:10,175 --> 01:46:11,574
Thanks, Brodie.

1366
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:15,129
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Mackeridge.

1367
01:46:15,175 --> 01:46:17,131
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks, Blake.

1368
01:46:17,175 --> 01:46:18,654
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

1369
01:46:19,655 --> 01:46:21,566
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Hardy.

1370
01:47:14,055 --> 01:47:16,694
<i>Here ends the story of a ship,</i>

1371
01:47:16,735 --> 01:47:19,010
<i>but there will always be other ships,</i>

1372
01:47:19,055 --> 01:47:21,364
<i>for we are an island race.</i>

1373
01:47:22,655 --> 01:47:26,409
<i>Through all our centuries,</i>
<i>the sea has ruled our destiny.</i>

1374
01:47:27,815 --> 01:47:31,012
<i>There will always be other ships</i>
<i>and men to sail in them</i>

1375
01:47:32,295 --> 01:47:37,164
<i>It is these men, in peace or war,</i>
<i>to whom we owe so much.</i>

1376
01:47:38,255 --> 01:47:42,692
<i>Above all victories, beyond all loss,</i>

1377
01:47:42,735 --> 01:47:45,886
<i>in spite of changing values</i>
<i>in a changing world,</i>

1378
01:47:46,975 --> 01:47:50,285
<i>they give, to us, their countrymen,</i>

1379
01:47:50,335 --> 01:47:52,895
<i>eternal and indomitable pride.</i>

1380
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:57,491
(Cheering)

1381
01:48:00,135 --> 01:48:01,454
Open fire!

1382
01:48:04,215 --> 01:48:08,367
<i>God bless our ships, and all who sail in them.</i>
