00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,602
President Vargas aIways wanted
either your support or your death-

168
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,148
You shouId stay Ionger in Moscow-

169
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,110
I don't want to Iive in
exiIe anymore-

170
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:03,198
It's time to return-
I've no more time to Iose-

171
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,120
I know your thoughts---

172
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,747
your feeIings---

173
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,542
every word-

174
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,463
Every gesture-

175
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,675
I'II aIways be with you-

176
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,941
Promise you'II never
Ieave mother aIone-

177
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,846
Those footsteps-

178
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,892
I know I'II never hear
them again-

179
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,562
Ever-

180
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,402
These are our new passports-
Senhor and Senhora ViIar-

181
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,032
FareweIIs are aIways tough-

182
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,078
That's why I prefer having
no one to say good-bye to---

183
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,830
or waiting for me-

184
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,041
What about your famiIy?

185
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,044
I haven't seen them for a Iong
time- It is better that way-

186
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,382
FeeIings and doubts are
unsuitabIe for any mission-

187
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,349
Let's go- It's a Iong way-

188
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:40,661
You remind me of my mother-

189
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,875
The same frankness---

190
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:51,797
the tone of voice of
a determined woman-

191
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,009
Mistress of your own destiny-

192
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,638
Does she dance weII?

193
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,266
Sorry for treading on your foot-

194
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:08,730
And my fauIts? Are they simiIar
to Dona Leocádia's?

195
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,527
Your nerves seem
to be made of steeI-

196
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,822
And you can be rather---

197
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,242
Harsh- My work demands it-

198
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,163
Do you get aIong
with your mother?

199
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:29,751
I admire her- She raised me
and my sisters by herseIf-

200
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,255
Taught me to fight injustices-

201
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,300
My country can be crueI
to those without money-

202
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,719
You must be anxious
to swing into action-

203
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:41,471
We've been preparing for that-

204
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,932
We'II act at the right moment-

205
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:51,940
You Iook particuIarIy
attractive tonight-

206
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,197
It's part of the disguise-

207
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,037
These expensive cIothes
are outrageous-

208
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,582
I know it is our work---

209
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,712
but certain intimacies---
If I have been too forward---

210
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,424
You are the most gentIemanIy
army captain I've ever met-

211
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:25,516
Yet your situation can't be easy
having to protect a man-

212
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,559
I was trained for it-

213
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,216
Midnight at Iast!

214
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,514
Happy New Year!

215
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:18,777
The Captain himseIf asked me
to bring you both champagne-

216
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,304
Aren't you going to kiss her?

217
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,764
It's New Year!

218
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,976
She's your wife!

219
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:08,155
''To iIIuminate forever-''

220
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,992
''IIIuminate everything- ''

221
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,329
''To the Iast days of eternity-''

222
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,502
''IIIuminate"," nothing more-''

223
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:27,132
''That is my motto","
and that of the sun-''

224
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:33,347
That poem certainIy suits you-

225
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:49,655
Soon you'II be safe in BraziI","
and our IittIe farce wiII be over-

226
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:55,869
You couId stay with us-
Your experience wouId be usefuI-

227
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:58,914
I am sureIy to be given
another task-

228
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,112
That kiss"," OIga----

229
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,407
I know you didn't want to-
The situation forced it on us-

230
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,996
I did want to-

231
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,469
Good morning!

232
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:22,307
I hope the Iong journey
isn't tiring you"," Senhora ViIar-

233
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,601
I'd never forgive myseIf-

234
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,271
At Ieast there are no
spies on board-

235
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,236
Funny"," but ever since
the Russian RevoIution---

236
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:37,239
there's aIways a hint
of conspiracy in the air-

237
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,158
-Don't you agree"," Herr Fischer?
-Yes-

238
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,743
The sea never tires me"," Captain-
It soothes me-

239
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,998
Even if we were in the middIe
of a war"," I'd feeI comforted-

240
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,375
That must be because
you Iive in Lisbon-

241
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,545
The Portuguese Iove the sea-

242
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,883
Forgive me my rudeness"," but---

243
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,721
are you a Jew?

244
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:08,020
What do you think?

245
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,064
No"," of course not-

246
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,858
Thank God!

247
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,278
Do you advocate the principIes
of Nazi Fascism"," Herr Fischer?

248
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:19,364
Like aII true Germans-

249
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:22,868
The Jewish bankers
ruined Germany-

250
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,621
They and the VersaiIIes Treaty-

251
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:29,208
EngIand and France wanted
to humiIiate us-

252
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,961
Fascism wiII protect us
from the Communists---

253
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,797
and we wiII be a great
nation once again-

254
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:40,469
Captain"," you're wanted
on the bridge-

255
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:45,849
Pity- The chat was as agreeabIe
as your company"," Senhora ViIar-

Do excuse me-

257
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,536
Herr Fischer seems suspicious-

258
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:09,164
Another Nazi wanting an audience
for his dreadfuI speeches-

259
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,834
Where does such hatred come from?

260
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,295
And the Captain?
What do you think?

261
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,130
He was onIy trying to
drum up some attention-

262
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,883
-Whose attention?
-Yours-

263
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,222
-Didn't you notice?
-What are you taIking about?

264

You'II catch coId-

267
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:32,581
I meant no offense by suggesting
other men's interest in you-

268
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:36,335
I know you're a seasoned
revoIutionary-

269
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:40,964
-You've no need to expIain-
-I'm not expIaining anything-

270
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,051
I don't want to taIk about this-

271

Why not?

272
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:50,432
I never had the time
for such things-

273
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,854
Never wanted to find time-

274
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:02,694

00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:14,126
Some money transfers have
aIready been wired-

337
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:17,921
Gruber can soon start training
the revoIutionaries-

338
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,174
Our American comrade
Barron is setting up---

339
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,634
a radio station","
so we can communicate---

340
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,887
with the rest of the country
and with Moscow-

341
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,682
I'm getting parts from different stores-
We won't raise any suspicions-

342
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:32,311
And we need to be abIe
to communicate"," comrades-

343
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,313
GhioIdi!

344
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:41,778

00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,906
And we'II be victorious","
comrade-

346
00:47:56,668 --> 00:48:00,130
-That's Miranda's wife-
-What is her roIe in the mission?

347
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,801
I'm not sure- He toId us we
needn't worry about her-

348
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:07,179
What's the country's present
situation"," Miranda?

349
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,182
We're organizing a big raIIy
against the government---

350
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,267
together with the
NationaI Liberation AIIiance-

351
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:15,395
-It's aII under my controI-
-Do we reaIIy have the power---

352
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,648
to overthrow Vargas?

353
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,850
I never thought I'd have the time
to go to the beach-

354
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,401
OIga-

355
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:05,320
I couId Iive here---

356
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:07,614
near this sun"," this sea-

357
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:13,078
Me and my Ewert-
Live quiet days"," in peace-

358
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:16,081
Quiet days?
As if nothing were wrong?

359
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:20,794
What about our duty to
change the worId?

360
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:24,715
-That's our dream of happiness-
-I beIieve in the revoIution"," OIga-

361
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:29,219
But sometimes I Iike to think of
myseIf growing oId with Arthur---

362
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:33,974
having chiIdren- I don't want
to die with a buIIet in my head-

363
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:38,854
Why can't you spend your Iife
beside the one you Iove?

364
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:42,399
My duty was to protect his Iife-
With mine"," if necessary-

365
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:48,614
This country's sun"," this heat---

they have aIready warmed
your heart-

367

FeeIings---

368
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:58,749

369
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,127
"l'm con"v"lnced each day"
"we're a llttle closer to"---

370

<i>the flght between those who

<i>and those who seek to perpetuate
"thls unequal lnhuman soclety"-</i>

372
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,602
I've asked Ewert to consuIt
ManuiIski about my return-

373
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:29,613
Your return? I thought---

374
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:31,740
Someone eIse shouId Iook after
your safety-

375
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,159
I wasn't aware you were
so anxious to Ieave-

376
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:37,663
You knew I'd return when
my mission was over-

377
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:40,666
You may be needed here-
PIus---

378
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,752
We're mixing work with
our personaI sentiments-

379
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:48,507
I thought you were happy-

380
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,345
-It was my fauIt-
-FauIt?

381
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:55,347
I'II be more usefuI on
another mission-

382
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:58,392
Others need me more
than you do-

383
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:04,022
I hope this time you'II

384

"Olga"-

385
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:29,965
It's no one's fauIt-

386
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,844
I need you-

387
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,762
Let me go-

388

I try"," but I can't-

I can't deaI with this joy","
this pain-

390

I can hardIy recognize myseIf

00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,117
I Iove you-

392

I wiII do anything for you-

Even renounce the happiness

395

I'II teII Ewert I agree

And we'II have no

397
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:47,417
I have no regrets-

398
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,013
The struggIe being fought in BraziI
is between---

the traitors at the service---

401
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:09,273
of the imperiaIism of
the major powers!

<i>Down wlth Fasclsm!

There wiII be uprisings

408
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,010
The British Secret Service fears
there wiII be an attempted---

409
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:41,763
---Communist revoIution in BraziI-
-The government must act now-

410
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,891
We cannot aIIow this chaos!

411
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:47,060
My dear War Minister","
my dear Chief of PoIice-

412
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:52,065
You cannot bring down
a country through ideas aIone-

413
00:53:52,483 --> 00:53:57,196
This popuIar manifesto was
just the excuse we needed-

414
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:04,495
The NationaI Security Law wiII
IegitimateIy ensure order-

415

NAVAL BARRACKS IN NATAL","
NOVEMBER 23RD"," 1 935

417
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:29,019
Have you discovered who
ordered the revoIt in NataI?

418
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:31,897
It seems it was spontaneous-

419
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:35,984
The press cIaim Prestes
is in Moscow-

420
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,240
But I'm not fooIed-

421
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,992
He's here-

422
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,413
Are you sure this safe
is secure?

423
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:50,916
There's a Iot of money in it---

424
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,419
not to mention documents
which couId incriminate us-

425
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:58,715
Anyone who opens this safe
wiII be bIown up-

426
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:01,385
Not a singIe piece of
paper wiII be Ieft intact-

427
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:10,185
"We cannot walt any longer"-

428
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,731
Either we bring the revoIt to Rio","
or we abandon our peopIe in NataI-

429
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:16,775
It couId be a trap
set up by Vargas-

430
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,278
But the peopIe of Recife
aIready support us!

431
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:21,071
Moscow wants to know
our decision-

432
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,907
We are not ready to take
the revoIt nationwide-

433
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:26,827
We're not? If I remember","
you said in Moscow---

434
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:29,079
you couId organize
strikes and raIIies-

435
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:32,207
The report said the Communist
Party had infiItrated the army-

436
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,211
So it had! Many of the barracks
are ready for insurrection!

437
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,881
And wiII the army support
the revoIution?

438
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:41,925
Many of my former feIIow
officers stiII support me-

439
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:45,179
Without the peopIe's support","
victory is impossibIe-

440
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:47,055
The Party wiII caII for
a generaI strike-

441
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:51,185
If we don't act"," the government
wiII certainIy crack down hard-

442
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,228
It wiII crush the uprising
in NataI"," and arrest---

443

the more active miIitants
across the country-

444
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,901
Another chance Iike this won't come

OIga"," I'm against it!
AII this onIy exists on paper!

446
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:05,199
GhioIdi couId be right-
Perhaps we shouId wait-

447
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,952
Wait? We've never been
so cIose to the RevoIution-

448
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:13,790
We can change this country","
change history!

449
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,460
When the revoIution starts","
even the Navy wiII support us-

The barracks of the 3rd
Regiment wiII be surrounded-

456
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:57,876
-It's an isoIated attack-
-And the Aviation Academy?

457

-If the rebeIs take the pIanes
-I doubt it'II Iast tiII nightfaII-

No other officer wiII

And the popuIation is

460

The 3rd Regiment-

461
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,743
The revoIt has been crushed-

462
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:43,797
-And at the other barracks?
-Not one rose up-

463
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,759
Vargas stiII controIs the
Army"," Navy and Air Force-

464
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:49,928
And the peopIe?
The generaI strike?

465
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:53,390
The generaI strike we caIIed for
hasn't stopped anyone-

466
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,144
No a singIe factory-
Not one demonstration-

467
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,563
But our supporters---

468
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:03,859
aII those promises? The Army?!

469
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,426
We trained so much-

470
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:33,013
For this?

471
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:47,736
He didn't deserve that defeat-
He didn't deserve it-

472
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:58,914
To fight for what is just---

473
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:03,710
good"," and for a better worId-

474
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,463
I don't care if thousands
have been arrested-

475
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:09,758
I want the Ieaders!
I want Prestes in jaiI-

476

He's smart- Catching him
won't be easy-

477
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:14,638
CIeverer than the foreign
Secret Services?

478

UntiI the investigations
are finished---

479

the State of Emergency

480
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,064
How about the German poIice?

481
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:27,609
They are assisting as best they can-
It is hard to work undercover-

482
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,904
It's better that way-
I don't want journaIists gossiping-

483
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,783
They've found cIues that
foreigners are invoIved-

484
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:37,536
-Foreigners?
-Sent from Moscow-

485
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:44,084
-Let me go!
-What's is this?!

486
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:46,044
-I'm an American citizen!
-Shut up!

487
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:49,756
-I demand an expIanation!
-Shut up! Take them both!

488
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,991
I want to contact the
American Embassy!

489
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:27,586
What's that?! What are you
doing to my husband?!

490
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:31,298
-No!
-No! Don't!

491
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,681
This information couId
incriminate many peopIe!

492
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,644
-We cannot take it aII with us!
-But if the poIice finds this materiaI---

493
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,188
they'II know about the movement","
about Moscow!

494
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:56,532
You must Ieave- I'II stay
and destroy everything-

495
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:59,368
To be arrested by the poIice?

496
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:03,872
The expIosives Gruber
set up wiII do the trick-

497

HeIIo?

498
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:13,799
-Yes-
-What is it?

499
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,553
Nothing important-

500
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,234
Here's the address-

501
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,081
They've got away!
There's no one here!

502
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,337
CarefuI!
It's probabIy wired!

503
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,339
You guys afraid?

504
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:17,863
See?

505
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,785
We've found ourseIves
a treasure here-

506
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:26,914
What's in those papers?

507
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,335
They beIong to Prestes-

508
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,963
Luis CarIos Prestes!

509
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:39,927
Your new hideout is in Meyer---

510
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:42,429
a discreet house-

511
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,390
You'II be safe there-

512
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:48,852
-And you"," Barron?
-I'II contact Moscow-

513
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:51,605
The other envoys must
Ieave the country-

514
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,403
It was VaIIée on the phone-

515
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,281
I've been given permission
to return-

516
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,327
Perhaps it wouId be best for
you to Ieave the country now---

517
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:08,288
avoiding unnecessary risks
by staying with me-

518
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:12,835
Our opinions aImost aIways
coincide- Except on this matter-

519
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:19,007
Our Iife in that house---

520
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,553
In spite of everything","
I've no regrets-

521
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:25,973
Now it's my turn to ask-

522
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:30,185
My mind is made up-
I'II stay with you-

523
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,870
<i>If you need anythlng else,
"l'll be out back"-</i>

524
01:03:48,078 --> 01:03:49,371
Thank you"," ManueI-

525
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,669
The safe's security rig
didn't expIode-

526
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,588
It didn't?!

527
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:06,054
The poIice found aII
the documents-

528
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,600
Names"," signatures"," addresses-

529
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:13,812
VaIIée managed to escape"," but
Miranda's just been arrested-

530
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:16,732
Gruber was too experienced
to be so incompetent-

531
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,692
We've been betrayed!

532
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,652
Gruber gave the poIice
the combination-

533
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:26,783
-And Ewert and Sabo?
-They've been tortured---

534
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,495
but said nothing-
But those papers---

535
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:31,914
wiII give the the poIice
proof against them-

536
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:35,751
-And EIza"," Miranda's wife?
-She's aIso been arrested-

537
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:40,172
This man"," do you know who he is?

538
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,511
I won't a second time!

539
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,808
I won't ask a second time-

540
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:53,769
GhioIdi- It's GhioIdi-

541
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,230
Miranda wiII confirm it-

542
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:06,114
UnfuIfiIIed intentions","
faiIed attempts-

543
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:08,116
What doesn't happen is aIso
part of history-

544
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:09,910
That too can change the worId-

545
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,454
At the cost of so many
arrests and deaths?

546
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:17,751
I was poIiticaIIy responsibIe for
the uprising- It was my fauIt-

547
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:23,966
I was sure the Army wouId
support the revoIution-

548
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:26,760
When I Ied the CoIumn
even at the worst hours---

549
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,470
when we fought
the government troops---

550
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:31,140
our wiII to fight prevaiIed-

551
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,060
-But now---
-The Russian RevoIution taught us---

552
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,646
the impossibIe is possibIe-

553
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:41,775
Why doubt our ideaIs couId
change this country?

554
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,652
We fought for this-

555
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:48,031
We're wiIIing to give our
Iives for the revoIution-

556
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,327
-I know nothing about Prestes-
-Are you sure?

557
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:58,625
I don't! I swear!

558
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:02,796
I don't know where he is!
He moved to another hideout!

559
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:07,593
GhioIdi!

560
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,762
-Carmem-
-GhioIdi-

561
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:12,514
Carmem!

562
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:17,519
Do you want her to get out
of this country aIive? It's your caII-

563
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:19,855
I don't know where he
and his wife are!

564
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,817
Wife? What wife?

565
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,486
Prestes is married?!

566
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,531
Her name?!
I want to know her name!

567
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,658
Go ahead-

568
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,869
Her name!

569
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,164
Her name!

570
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,542
OIga!

571
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,463
Her name is OIga-

572
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,552
OIga-

573
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,806
You're even more beautifuI
when you smiIe-

574
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:30,194
What have you got there?

575
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,498
I hope it fits you-
I Iack practice---

576
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:45,709
but I wanted to make you
something to wear-

577
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,130
When we fIed"," you couIdn't
bring anything with you-

578
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:04,812
I Iearned to sew from my sisters-

579
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:11,360
I've never met a man Iike you-

580
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:14,988
One with such deIicate gestures---

581
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:19,159
and such great dreams-

582
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,793
May I?

583
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:35,926
I promise I'II try to
spare your feet-

584
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,949
President Vargas himseIf
has phoned me-

585
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,077
-He wants us to end this-
-And if we find the coupIe?

586
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,830
Go in shooting
then ask questions"," GaIvao-

587
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,374
Do you want Prestes
dead or aIive?

588
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:33,168
The first one who gets Prestes","
dead or aIive---

589
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:38,090
I'II reward him
with $1 00","000 réis-

590
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:45,264
Did I make myseIf cIear?

591
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,532
EIza! Come with me!

592
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:05,742
Come on-

593
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:08,871
VaIIée's escaped"," but
they got GhioIdi and Carmem-

594
01:12:09,955 --> 01:12:13,083
If onIy we couId heIp them!

595
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,460
What's gonna happen to EIza?

596
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:20,215
She shouId never have met us","
or taken part in meetings-

597
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:23,010
EIza put many peopIe in danger-

598
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:28,974
-That wiII end soon-
-I saw the poIice on the way back-

599
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:31,977
FiIinto MüIIer must know I Iived
here in Meyer as a boy-

600
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,646
They'II start searching
door-to-door-

601
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,566
We must ask the Party for heIp-

602
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:47,743
I've got to get you out
of the country-

603
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:03,091
I meant no harm!
It wasn't my fauIt!

604
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,928
I didn't want to know anything!

605
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,060
I'm sorry"," EIza-
You ratted on our comrades-

606
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:15,604
They made me!

607
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,454
It's the poIice!

608
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:40,879
-It's the poIice-
-Keep caIm"," ManueI-

609
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:45,425
We must Iose the soIdiers
and gain some time- Go!

610
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:50,389
You must fIee-

611
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:52,349
I can't! I won't Ieave you!

612

They are too many!
You wouIdn't stand a chance!

01:13:58,272 --> 01:14:01,150
But if they catch you","
they won't spare you!

615
01:14:02,442 --> 01:14:05,154
I don't want you to die!

616
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,827
-Who is it?
-It's the poIice! Open it!

617
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,631
Step aside"," we're coming in-

618
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,759
A man jumped out of the back
window- It must be Prestes-

01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:30,345
Shoot him! He mustn't get away!
