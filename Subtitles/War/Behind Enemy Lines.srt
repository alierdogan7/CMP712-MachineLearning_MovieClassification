1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:06,887
I'm John Davis. I'm the producer
of Behind Enemy Lines.

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:10,125
JOHN DAVIS: With me is Wyck Godfrey.
WYCK GODFREY: Hey.

3
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,487
JD:
Wyck is the executive producer.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,043
We'll do the commentary
from the producer's view.

5
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:20,885
Both of us worked on this film for
years. It's been about six years now.

6
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,693
The movie started with an idea. . .

7
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,846
. . .when Scott O'Grady
was shot down over Bosnia.

8
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:33,690
The idea was we could make a movie
that dealt with an American pilot. . .

9
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:36,128
. . .who's down behind enemy lines. . .

10
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:41,492
. . .where there were terrific obstacles
in being able to bring him out.

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,851
This pilot had to survive
on his wit and cunning. . .

12
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,891
. . .and just sheer determination
to survive.

13
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:54,048
We could make a movie that would be
exciting, that would bring to bear. . .

14
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:59,646
. . .all the technology the Navy and the
Air Force would make at our disposal.

15
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:05,052
If we could get a director who could
bring visualization and reality. . .

16
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:09,451
. . .maybe we could do something
that was exciting and different.

17
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:17,082
WG: It was John Moore and Zak Penn's
idea to open with a beautiful image. . .

18
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:22,248
. . .of soldiers planting trees. They
later become the mystery of the movie.

19
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:27,891
JD: We wanted a director who'd bring
a freshness. We went after John Moore.

20
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:32,684
He'd directed commercials
and music videos in Europe. . .

21
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,891
. . .where directing commercials
is an art form.

22
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:41,685
John, when he came on board, had
this vision, this fresh perspective.

23
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:47,485
I think John knows every kind
of military aircraft weapon.

24
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:52,648
Doesn't he know how to use hand
grenades, land mines and all that?

25
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:55,890
WG:
I think he's had some experience.

26
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,931
Here's the carrier,
the USS Carl Vinson.

27
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:05,288
We had Navy cooperation, which was one
of the big struggles of this film. . .

28
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:10,442
. . .because one of the things
John Moore, and we, wanted. . .

29
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:15,084
. . .was to shoot this action
in a way that no one had seen before.

30
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,689
So we went out at sea for a week.

31
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:22,329
While they were doing
their carrier qualifications. . .

32
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:27,846
. . .we would basically jump up on deck
when they weren't landing planes. . .

33
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:32,490
. . .get a scene and jump back down.
You can see a bit of it here.

34
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:38,882
JD: John said shooting on a carrier
is like living in a tin drum. . .

35
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:44,332
. . .with someone pounding on it
all day. Something's always going on.

36
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:49,732
Planes landing, taking off. We were
fortunate they allowed us on board.

37
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:55,291
September 1 1 th occurred a few months
after we finished shooting that.

38
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,882
We would've never been allowed on.

39
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:02,843
The access we had was amazing, and
probably won't be allowed for years. . .

40
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:06,932
. . .given the high state of military
alert that we're all on now.

41
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,607
BURNETT:
Four more days.

42
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:13,528
JD: It was a very long process
negotiating with the Navy.

43
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,850
We were fortunate
to befriend some pilots.

44
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:20,085
At one point, the project had stalled.

45
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,484
One of the pilots, Captain Kennedy,
came to me.

46
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,691
He was getting ready to retire
from the Navy.

47
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:31,484
He said, "This movie has to be made.
I'll help you with the process.

48
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:36,443
I'll help you with the carrier
and with the Department of Defense.

49
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:40,089
Get interested again in this project.
Get it moving. "

50
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,485
That was a key point. After that,
he introduced us to pilots. . .

51
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:49,887
. . .and we were able to get this sense
that the movie is really based on:

52
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:55,161
These are ordinary men, not Top Gun
pilots. They don't ride motorcycles.

53
00:03:55,373 --> 00:04:00,493
They have families. They're the kids
next door who always wanted to fly.

54
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,282
They're ordinary men
who can do extraordinary things.

55
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:07,252
That's what Owen Wilson is
in this movie.

56
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:10,485
He's the navigator.
That was Owen's idea.

57
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,722
He was the pilot.

58
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:14,691
-He made the change in the script.
WG: Right.

59
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:20,849
JD: He basically helped us play up
that idea of an ordinary individual.

60
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:25,848
He certainly is everyman,
and he was casted for that reason.

61
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,489
The idea was to make this real
and go against type.

62
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:33,487
Make Owen feel like the pilots
we had met.

63
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:38,648
We had to negotiate with the
Department of Defense over the script.

64
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,848
They like accuracy and
they're sensitive about things.

65
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:48,652
Intense negotiations. We didn't want
to compromise the film's integrity. . .

66
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:54,968
. . .but we needed access to
the helicopters, the aircraft carrier.

67
00:04:55,533 --> 00:05:00,084
We were able to find
a middle ground on some issues. . .

68
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,850
. . .and then, boom,
we were off and running.

69
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:10,290
WG: You'd think they wouldn't want to
show guys play football on the deck. . .

70
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:15,288
. . .but it came while we were shooting,
we decided to open the movie. . .

71
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,487
. . .with something
more fitting with Owen. . .

72
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,250
. . .and the character.
It was a bit more light.

73
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:26,645
We originally had a big
action sequence in the air. . .

74
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:32,962
. . .but it didn't fit the idea of them
in the Adriatic with nothing to do. . .

75
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,689
. . .and this really pulled it off.

76
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:40,489
JD: We want to thank the NFL for
supplying that football that we lost.

77
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:44,043
WG: We only knocked about 1 8
of them into the ocean.

78
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:52,166
JD: Gene Hackman was the first actor
hired on the film.

79
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:57,242
It was important to me--
I was doing Heartbreakers with Gene.

80
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:01,645
This is the sixth movie I've done with
him-- To get him involved.

81
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:06,489
The studio felt when Gene signed on
the part had weight and bearing.

82
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,042
WG:
He's a real anchor for movies.

83
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,853
JD: But John hadn't directed
a movie before.

84
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:15,449
I got Gene to accept
a first-time director.

85
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,292
I wanted to keep Gene
from meeting him.

86
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:24,130
I was afraid if Gene met him and
didn't like him, I'd be in trouble.

87
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:30,090
With first-time directors and actors,
you've got to be fairly clever.

88
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:35,128
Gene asked me, "When will I meet
this director?" I kept saying, "Soon. "

89
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:39,242
He went to do another film.
By the time he came back. . .

90
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:44,652
. . .it was time to go to Europe
and shoot the movie, so we were safe.

91
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:51,042
WG: I guess Gene met John in Slovakia
the day before he started shooting.

92
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:57,048
-I know that's not Burnett.
BURNETT: Captain, good to see you.

93
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,892
JD:
Gene Hackman green-lit this movie.

94
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:04,411
This movie was done for a price.
This is a $40 million movie.

95
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:09,846
Which, in action movie parlance,
is a low-budget movie.

96
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:14,092
Gene only worked
on the movie five weeks. . .

97
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,882
. . .but it feels like
he's on the movie the entire time.

98
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:22,649
Getting him on board for that period
of time so we could afford him. . .

99
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:27,881
. . .and using him the way we did in
this film, gave the studio a sense. . .

100
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,365
. . .that no matter who else
we brought in, it was anchored.

101
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:37,733
Gene has a foreign audience and
he'll turn in a brilliant performance.

102
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,528
His performance fit
what we're trying to accomplish. . .

103
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:47,167
. . .which was a real movie,
21 st century war action picture.

104
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,682
WG: The next step was to find out
who that guy would be.

105
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:57,883
As you can see, Owen was who we went
with. Gene thought it was a good idea.

106
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,045
We felt Owen wasn't a movie star yet.

107
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,681
We felt like we could break him. . .

108
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:08,085
. . .Iike Bruce Willis had never done
an action film before Die Hard...

109
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,485
. . .and Keanu Reeves had never done
an action film before Speed.

110
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:17,488
Owen really pulled off something
that I think people--

111
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:21,851
People were surprised to see him
in a movie like this.

112
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,443
His sort of irreverent tone
in the beginning. . .

113
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:28,531
. . .is what people bring
from his other films.

114
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:31,161
Then he transforms through this film.

115
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:36,049
-You'll see him doing more action.
JD: I saw him in the Tom Dey picture.

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,689
Wyck, can you help me on the name
of that picture?

117
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:44,085
Shanghai Noon. I saw him
in Shanghai Noon. That convinced me.

118
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,689
His charisma in that,
he played an action role. . .

119
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,846
. . .it was comedy and action.
His charisma there convinced me. . .

120
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:56,843
. . .that he could pull this off. Gene
saw that movie and was supportive.

121
00:08:57,053 --> 00:09:02,252
We went to the studio as a
united front and said, "We want Owen.

122
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:06,685
He can do it. We could interest him
in doing the role. "

123
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:11,245
Tom Rothman, to his credit,
understood it and went with it.

124
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:16,971
It wasn't an obvious choice,
but it's what makes the movie work.

125
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:21,163
-Sir, about the football--
REIGART: I have your letter--

126
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:25,764
JD: You make an action movie,
the foreign component is important.

127
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:31,246
Action movies do really well foreign.
They can do well in Germany and Japan.

128
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:35,846
You can do more business foreign
than domestically.

129
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:40,683
So having the right action movie
and the right cast is important.

130
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:45,165
Gene will help us foreign.
Owen will help us foreign also.

131
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:49,082
The most important thing
that will help us in Europe--

132
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:54,248
This conflict took place on European
soil. There's relevancy there.

133
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,691
For Japan, the special effects
and action will prove exciting. . .

134
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,892
. . .in the way they like
to see their high-tech action films.

135
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,046
WG: This is the one main scene
Owen and Gene are in together.

136
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:12,048
When we started shooting with Owen,
he has a tendency to show up. . .

137
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:18,289
. . .and look at the scene and say,
"I wouldn't say this, I'd say this. "

138
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:22,685
Since he's a good writer
and may get. . .

139
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:26,482
. . .an Academy Award nomination
for Tenenbaums--

140
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:30,487
But the night before he shot this,
he was a bit nervous.

141
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,845
I said to him, "Owen, you can't
rewrite this scene tomorrow.

142
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:39,888
You have to memorize it. Gene will
kill us if we try to change it. "

143
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,887
And he showed up and knew his lines.

144
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:49,253
JD: Gene never once got mad at anybody
on this movie, which is great.

145
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:51,284
He got mad at John once.

146
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:56,084
WG: He got mad at us once when we
shifted around some lines in a scene.

147
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:02,488
Gene works very hard to get his scenes
down days before he shoots them.

148
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:08,490
So, in all fairness, you don't want
to show up the same day and say:

149
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,087
"We thought about doing it this way. "

150
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,443
He put a stop to that early on.

151
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:19,171
JD: Gene's a professional. He shows up
two, three minutes before you shoot.

152
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,564
He doesn't chat with anybody.
He does his scene. . .

153
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:27,889
. . .then leaves the set right after
and goes back to his trailer.

154
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:32,888
He's all about business,
but every single take is great.

155
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:44,091
The toughest thing about being
a producer on location far away. . .

156
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,690
. . .is having to be away from your
family. Wyck's wife was pregnant. . .

157
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,088
. . .had two children just before. . .

158
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,292
. . .and needed to be on the ground
for the entire period.

159
00:11:55,653 --> 00:12:01,205
Our company was shooting three movies,
so we were all moving around.

160
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,689
Wyck was on location.
I came to visit. . .

161
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:11,327
. . .and was overwhelmed by the fact we
were shooting in a Third World country.

162
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:17,046
The technology and support systems
were very rudimentary.

163
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:21,047
It was inexpensive to shoot
where we were shooting.

164
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,409
The construction costs
were very cheap. . .

165
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:29,003
. . .but you were shooting
in a Third World country.

166
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,643
WG:
We shot the film in Slovakia.

167
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:38,048
Which is Czechoslovakia split in two:
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. . .

168
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:43,247
. . .which is primarily the sort of
farming part of that country.

169
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,885
It was pretty brutal. Tough situation.

170
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,011
Between that and shooting
on a carrier. . .

171
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:55,446
. . .it was the hardest physical
production I've ever been involved in.

172
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:59,447
JD: Wyck had a tough time on the
aircraft carrier getting room service.

173
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,762
[MAN GIGGLES]

174
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,493
-Dad, I gotta go.
-We're very proud--

175
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:10,205
WG: The only thing that allows you to
sleep is because you're so exhausted.

176
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:14,645
They're landing aircraft on your head
until 2:00 a.m. . .

177
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:17,413
. . .and start again at 6:00 a.m.

178
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:22,084
So you don't get much sleep.
Somehow, by the third or fourth day. . .

179
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,688
. . .you can sleep through anything.

180
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,289
The problem is that you're
working around their plan.

181
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:33,891
They have a number of planes to get
down and up to get their qualifications.

182
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,845
You're given three hours.

183
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:40,683
If you're not off the deck,
you'll have a plane land on your head.

184
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,050
For a movie that you need
a lot of control in. . .

185
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:50,647
. . .to get these scenes,
it was amazingly difficult.

186
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:55,489
JD: The scene coming up, which is
going to be the shoot-down sequence. . .

187
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:00,443
. . .created more anxiety for us
than any other aspect of the movie.

188
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:03,685
Again, we did this movie
for a price. . .

189
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:08,245
. . .so we had to be clever with how
to shoot the shoot-down scene.

190
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:15,082
Our access to models technology and
other computer effects was limited.

191
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:21,807
So to put this together and make it
look real was the ultimate challenge.

192
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:25,922
WG: We wanted to shoot
as much as possible, real.

193
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:32,049
There was a point where they wanted us
to do this entire sequence CGl.

194
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:38,249
It was controllable. But we wanted
as much real F-1 8 footage as possible.

195
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:44,204
So we shot this in California,
air-to-air. We shot from the ground. . .

196
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:49,845
. . .which is this shot. Up in the air.
Then we had to put in the missiles.

197
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,568
There's nothing better
than seeing those real jets.

198
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:59,846
JD: You have three technologies here:
live-action, air-to-air photography. . .

199
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:04,848
. . .computer-generated effects,
and you're going to have models.

200
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:11,123
I've come to believe that models
are very tough to make look real.

201
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:16,885
The models are my least favorite.
The computer-generated missiles. . .

202
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:21,968
. . .after months and months of
finessing them, playing with them. . .

203
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,611
. . .and working on them, fairly good.

204
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:31,649
I guess we all feel this sequence
fulfilled our expectations 900/0 .

205
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,769
We were frustrated. . .

206
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,971
. . .we couldn't go the last 1 00/0 .

207
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,852
The models technology
given to complete this. . .

208
00:15:39,053 --> 00:15:41,851
. . .was just so difficult. . .

209
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:47,087
. . .to bring that level of reality we
wanted. There were some compromises.

210
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,289
You probably won't notice. . .

211
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:54,926
. . .but every time we see a shot we're
not happy with, it sticks in our side.

212
00:15:55,533 --> 00:16:00,049
WG: Some of these were shot on a stage
with a gimbal and a mockup F-1 8. . .

213
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:03,689
. . .and you mapped in the background.

214
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,246
Another useless joyride
at the cost of--

215
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:16,566
JD:
A producer has to always. . .

216
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:21,443
. . .do what's possible in a situation.
A producer is always compromising.

217
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:26,084
The idea is not to compromise
the quality of the film.

218
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,292
The studio will force you
to compromise on the budget.

219
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:36,130
The director has to compromise on his
vision because you can't afford it.

220
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:39,683
But you've got to keep him
from being discouraged.

221
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:44,290
The actors have to compromise
on what they want to say and do.

222
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:47,849
They're part of a process.
It has to work together.

223
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:51,602
The producer is the person
in the middle. . .

224
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:55,448
. . .trying to keep everybody on course
and moving forward.

225
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,365
Keeping people from being discouraged
when making a compromise. . .

226
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,843
. . .that is in the best interest
of the film.

227
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:08,366
And/or keeping the film
from getting shut down by the studio.

228
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:13,170
If you don't make your budget,
the studio can start cutting pages.

229
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:18,363
Nobody wants to do that. Sometimes,
before you get your movie made. . .

230
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:22,572
. . .the studio is gonna force you
to agree to your budget.

231
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:27,682
They'll have the power to keep you
from varying from that budget.

232
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:34,042
So it's very difficult being
a producer on a movie such as this.

233
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:40,647
You want to achieve so much, yet there
are tradeoffs that have to happen.

234
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:50,689
WG: One thing we did on the ground
because John Moore wants everything. . .

235
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:54,603
. . .and in particular,
all of the hardware you see.

236
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:58,089
The tanks, and the guns, and the--

237
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:03,043
All of that stuff was constantly
trying to be squeezed down. . .

238
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,847
. . .by the studio
for budgetary reasons.

239
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:09,887
"You can't have five tanks, just two. "
We were squeezing. . .

240
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:13,842
. . .and finding a way to get him
as much as he needed. . .

241
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,970
. . .to fill out the scenes.

242
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:21,929
JD: lsn't that you flying the plane?
WG: Oh, yeah.

243
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:26,282
Here's the introduction. . .

244
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,402
. . .of our sniper assassin,
played by Vladimir Mashkov.

245
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:34,690
He's a huge Russian actor
and directs theater.

246
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:37,123
He's one of their big stars. . .

247
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:42,453
. . .and he really carries a great,
quiet sense of menace.

248
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:48,044
JD:
These missiles are all CGl.

249
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:51,843
It stands for
computer-generated imagery.

250
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:56,891
STACKHOUSE: I don't. Call my turn.
BURNETT: Just slice left. Hard.

251
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,091
STACKHOUSE:
Jesus Christ.

252
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,170
Where is it?

253
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:06,888
JD: It's funny, the director wanted
to shoot the movie in Sarajevo.

254
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:11,251
WG: Our first compromise.
He wanted to shoot it in Croatia.

255
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,961
It was just a little bit too hairy.

256
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:18,729
But Slovakia, in terms of
the back country, is a good match.

257
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:22,448
Bratislava's not so bad
because at least it's a city.

258
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:27,847
But some of the places we shot were
30 miles from the Ukraine border. . .

259
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:31,045
. . .up in the mountains, and it was--

260
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:36,447
There were times we hopped in
four-wheel drives to get to a site.

261
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:39,123
It was as secluded as could be.

262
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,292
JD: But cell phones worked
throughout this entire country.

263
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:47,287
You could always get anybody
on the phone in the U.S.

264
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:50,923
One day I talked to John,
he was scouting locations.

265
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:55,769
I was trying to convince him not
to go to Sarajevo and get shot.

266
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:59,602
He tried to convince me
that Sarajevo was now safe.

267
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:02,247
It was something I didn't buy.

268
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:08,847
During our conversation, he says,
"I'm surrounded by armed guards.

269
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:14,292
I'm at a border. They want me to get
out of the car. I'll call you back. "

270
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:18,645
I had visions that our director was
gonna be arrested as a spy.

271
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,890
Fortunately, he was able
to call me back later. . .

272
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:26,684
. . .and get himself out
of whatever jam he was in.

273
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,772
WG:
Here's the model shots.

274
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:33,285
JD: These are the model shots
which I was particularly unhappy with.

275
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,489
But I think that. . .

276
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:40,648
. . .they came out fairly well
after we were able to massage them.

277
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:45,210
There's a lot of color correction
to try to make them look real.

278
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:51,045
There was some fog we put into the
shots to make it feel more natural.

279
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:56,291
WG: It's one of the most positively
reviewed sequences in the movie.

280
00:20:56,493 --> 00:21:02,204
So all the stuff you obsess about
doesn't matter to everyone.

281
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,292
JD:
lf you don't obsess. . .

282
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:08,811
. . .it's never going to be as good
as it should be or can be.

283
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:13,046
Even if you don't get everything
you want, if you obsess. . .

284
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:17,968
. . .convinced it'll be a disaster,
somehow you get it good enough.

285
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,606
And hopefully great.

286
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,322
Shit!

287
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,486
JD:
The movie's editing is interesting.

288
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:34,089
Basically, the director gets 1 0 weeks
after shooting.

289
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:39,208
Technically, you're not allowed
to interfere with him. John was great.

290
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:40,926
He brought us in.

291
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:46,207
When I was in Slovakia, I convinced
him on the set at a weak moment. . .

292
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:51,567
. . .to let me go in the editing room
and take a look.

293
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:55,686
Now, while he's shooting,
I'm looking at the movie.

294
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:58,532
I could tell the movie was working.

295
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:05,081
I was able to tell that the movie
had a fantastic look.

296
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:09,684
The cinematography was working well
with his camera technology. . .

297
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,208
. . .to tell a story.

298
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,449
The movie had this feel.

299
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:20,006
From there, John Moore showed us both
the film very early on. . .

300
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:25,124
. . .and we were able to discuss
with him choices he was making.

301
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:29,002
A first-time director,
he wanted everything in the movie.

302
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:33,485
As time went on, he realized
that he had a story to tell.

303
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:37,648
He learned that well
and picked it up quickly.

304
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:42,887
As a producer, you're constantly going
in the editing room. . .

305
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:47,291
. . .trying to impart into the director
a sense of objectivity. . .

306
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:52,481
. . .about how one might improve
the storytelling or improve the pace.

307
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:57,851
Wyck and I enjoyed our time
in the editing room with John.

308
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:01,326
It's a lot of fun being
in the editing room.

309
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:05,608
It gives you a sense
of the making of the movie. . .

310
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:08,247
. . .in its little bits and pieces.

311
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:13,766
These little details very much
add up to the pace. . .

312
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:17,130
. . .and the quality of the storytelling
in the movie.

313
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:24,610
-A hell of a party, sir.
-I really like Christmas.

314
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:28,286
JD:
The editing room is not a democracy.

315
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:32,287
In a film, there's supposed
to be one vision.

316
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:37,607
A producer has got to support that.
The vision needs to be the director's.

317
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,451
If you have seven visions,
and they're all in a movie. . .

318
00:23:42,693 --> 00:23:46,686
. . .it'll be chaos. The movie won't
be as good as it should.

319
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:48,852
It could be a disaster.

320
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,328
Editing is never a democracy. . .

321
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:56,288
. . .but if you have a good relationship
with your director. . .

322
00:23:56,533 --> 00:24:01,687
. . .the producer can have tremendous
impact on how the picture is cut.

323
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:08,889
WG: Part of the process is when
the studio gets involved.

324
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:14,651
We test the movie. They'll have a lot
of input and insight with fresh eyes.

325
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:21,247
Part of our job is to listen to those
ideas and figure out the best way. . .

326
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,850
. . .to put the ones that are important
and work for the movie in. . .

327
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:29,849
. . .while massaging the ones
that may not be additive.

328
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:36,845
JD: The studio and the audience
will be involved in the editing.

329
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:40,682
Because what we do is test
a movie with an audience.

330
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:44,642
When you do that,
you can hear and feel the audience.

331
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:48,249
You know when they're into it,
when they're bored. . .

332
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,651
. . .when something's working
that excites them emotionally.

333
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,890
And then, in the end,
we do a focus group.

334
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:59,409
But it's more important
to feel an audience.

335
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:05,045
A lot of times, you need to use that
input to further refine your movie.

336
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,652
Shit. Squeeze right here.

337
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:15,445
JD: When you first see a film
with an audience, you're terrified.

338
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:19,925
You have no idea--
The director's even more terrified.

339
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:26,567
If people are gonna like the film
or not like the film and not respond.

340
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:32,285
You don't know. You can have a sense.
You can hope. You can have a feeling.

341
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:37,368
I go into those screenings and we've
worked enough on the picture. . .

342
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:42,211
. . .so you like it. You've gotten it
into the shape where you. . .

343
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,489
. . .are somewhat happy with it.

344
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:49,721
WG: You've seen it so many times you
don't know how people will respond to it.

345
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:53,602
You've forgotten how you felt
the first time you saw it.

346
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:57,692
JD: That's a good point.
You've read the script 50 times. . .

347
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,642
. . .you've seen the picture five,
six, seven times before.

348
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:08,048
The audience is a fresh,
objective opinion on a picture.

349
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:12,007
WG: It takes you back
to when you green-light the film.

350
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:18,607
That was when you thought this would
be a commercial, satisfying movie.

351
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:25,088
It's a year and a half later, you're
finally seeing if you were right.

352
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,811
Oh, God.

353
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:33,446
JD: The screening process
always turns up something.

354
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,890
It always turns up some unexpected. . .

355
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:40,489
. . .piece of information that you need
to react to.

356
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:45,530
This picture tested very well
the first time we tested it.

357
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:49,288
But what became obvious
is we had too many endings.

358
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:54,448
We had three or four. The challenge
was, "How do we give it one ending. . .

359
00:26:54,693 --> 00:27:00,450
. . .but create enough closure with all
the story sub-elements and subplots. . .

360
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:04,652
. . .so the audience feels
sufficiently informed at the end?"

361
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:11,241
Frankly, I had a sense we had too
many endings, but I liked them all.

362
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:15,088
I wasn't sure that we had
to do something about it.

363
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,893
The audience was very clear
about that.

364
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:23,651
When the movie was over for them
emotionally, the movie was over.

365
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:29,843
Now this scene, Wyck, you want
to describe what it was like. . .

366
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:33,489
. . .getting those pieces
of aircraft on that mountain?

367
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:38,682
We showed up and the production
designer had, on this mountain. . .

368
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:42,130
. . .burned a whole swatch of land. . .

369
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:44,968
. . .and laid out the pieces
of the plane.

370
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:48,489
I said, "John, how come
the whole plane is laid out there?

371
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,803
Didn't they land separately?"

372
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:55,848
We hadn't even begun
to shoot the shoot-down sequence.

373
00:27:56,053 --> 00:28:00,251
We didn't do that sequence
until we got back to Los Angeles.

374
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:04,082
But you can't tell
that the entire plane's there.

375
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,245
We shot around it pretty well.

376
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:12,052
One of John's favorite shots.
It was 7 in the morning.

377
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,450
He loved the guys
coming over the mountain.

378
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:19,851
This was the most removed location
of the entire movie.

379
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:24,251
We were as high on a mountain
as you could get in Slovakia.

380
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:28,241
We were always in danger
of not making it to the site.

381
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:31,286
Rain would have washed out the roads.

382
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:34,809
It was a miracle we got out
of this location.

383
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,370
JD: The other problem was that
this movie was shot in the winter.

384
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:43,488
This particular scene was shot
in November, I believe.

385
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:48,284
The sun disappeared here
probably about 3:30 or 4:00.

386
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:52,972
So you had a very short day
to work with.

387
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,852
Given that we had a short schedule. . .

388
00:28:56,053 --> 00:29:00,285
. . .it's very important the director
knew exactly what he wanted. . .

389
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:02,927
. . .how to get it,
and to move quickly.

390
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:06,563
WG: We only had about 7 1 /2 hours
of daylight.

391
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:10,846
It was really difficult.

392
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:21,450
Casting the soldiers was pretty easy.
We went and got the Slovakian army.

393
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,082
We went to them and said:

394
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,688
"We need to use. . .

395
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:32,849
. . .your Russian-made armory, and
we need to use the tanks and stuff. "

396
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:38,081
All of our great extras are actually
the elite soldiers of Slovakia.

397
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:44,090
So they understand organization,
they understand discipline.

398
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,643
And in terms of using them,
it worked out great.

399
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:53,450
You'd say, "We need you here. " They'd
be there. You can't fake the training.

400
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:58,847
When they come through Hach later,
you'll see how professional they are.

401
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:00,691
They're the real deal.

402
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:07,281
One thing about Slovakia, rather
than Canada, which we thought about. . .

403
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:12,653
. . .is that all of our extras
truly have that Eastern European look.

404
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,731
The Muslims are all Muslims.

405
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:20,484
A lot of our extras or smaller cast. . .

406
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,645
. . .were Croatian, from that territory.

407
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,050
There was a sense
of realism to the casting.

408
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:32,925
JD: And these elite soldiers swore
their allegiance to the director.

409
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,646
When the studio tried. . .

410
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:38,289
. . .to enforce a shorter schedule,
they were there. . .

411
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,969
. . .to hold them at bay,
and that was helpful.

412
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:52,083
WG: Again, that was probably
one of the easiest things.

413
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:58,488
The government of Slovakia fought very
hard to get us to come to Slovakia.

414
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:04,683
There's so much filming in the Czech
Republic, Slovakia gets the leftovers.

415
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:09,688
So when you go and make a deal
with Slovakia to use. . .

416
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:12,048
. . .their stages in Bratislava. . .

417
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:15,805
. . .for a military film,
you've got a good line. . .

418
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:20,524
. . .to get the government to put
pressure on the military to help.

419
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:26,012
JD: I still remember my first day
in Slovakia, driving to the set.

420
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:31,845
We were at a studio,
and there were soldiers in the street.

421
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:35,807
This is not near the studio,
this is in Bratislava.

422
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:40,524
They were stopping people and
they were searching their cars. . .

423
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:44,046
. . .and checking their l.D.s.
I was thinking:

424
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:49,409
"Boy, this certainly feels like
a different place to shoot a movie. "

425
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,492
WG: The scene where Owen is running
and escaping earlier. . .

426
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:58,446
. . .he was doing his own stunts.

427
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:03,209
We had mortars exploding around him
and one blew up in his face.

428
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,883
He looked up after it was over and. . .

429
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:10,843
. . .was very calm about it:
"Okay, let's do it again. "

430
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:12,526
From that, we knew. . .

431
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:17,893
. . .we wouldn't have trouble getting
Owen to do any difficult stunt work.

432
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:22,684
JD: It's nice not having a prima donna
in a movie like this.

433
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:28,243
It'll be hard work and you'll have
to get in there and do your takes.

434
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:33,368
Be in crappy weather, and in different
locations. Really bust your ass.

435
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:37,687
Owen was able and willing
to do that.

436
00:32:37,853 --> 00:32:43,849
WG: Here was the first thing we shot.
The first day was up on this mountain.

437
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:47,409
Again, a very difficult location
to get to.

438
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,849
-What is that?
-Sorry, sir. There's interference.

439
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:52,805
The homing beacon.

440
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,651
Well, shut it off.

441
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:59,688
WG: Between Stephanie Austin,
our line producer, and l. . .

442
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:03,249
. . .you're dealing with every crisis
of the day.

443
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:07,850
The day before you shoot,
one helicopter is stuck at the border.

444
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:13,451
The gyroscope on your picture
helicopter is stuck in Venice. . .

445
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:18,090
. . .you can't get it out. Everything
has to be handled days before.

446
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:23,248
You know shooting in these locations,
there's gonna be a problem.

447
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:28,283
You kind of have to have the solutions
lined up. John Moore's. . .

448
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:33,482
. . .very good when he knows what
to expect, but doesn't like surprises.

449
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:36,486
I don't think any directors
like surprises.

450
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:41,206
Your best thing is to be ahead
of him as much as possible.

451
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:46,885
JD: This whole set Gene is on now,
the interior of the carrier. . .

452
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:49,044
. . .was all built in Slovakia.

453
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,889
It was a massive set.
It took up three sound stages.

454
00:33:54,133 --> 00:34:00,049
You could walk from one end of the
ship to the other on these stages. . .

455
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:05,202
. . .and go from porthole to porthole
to corner to curve, and it really--

456
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:09,884
It really felt, once you were inside
this set, it was so elaborate. . .

457
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,044
. . .that you were on a carrier.

458
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:16,166
When I was on the real carrier,
I was surprised how well. . .

459
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,086
. . .we were able to capture that feel.

460
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:24,885
WG: The designer and art director,
Nathan Crowley and Patrick Lumb. . .

461
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:30,685
. . .took tours of carriers before the
film had officially been green-lit. . .

462
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:35,648
. . .and took pictures and got the
layout. So when we got to Slovakia. . .

463
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:40,841
. . .we could duplicate it and enhance
it visually where we needed to.

464
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:46,008
The job they did is one of the things
that's phenomenal about the movie.

465
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:50,451
It has a great look
and a great sense of place.

466
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:55,490
The contrast between what's going on
on the ship and outdoors. . .

467
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:59,089
. . .it's one of the things people
really respond to.

468
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:04,646
It's so beautiful outdoors and you cut
to the ship and it's claustrophobic.

469
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:11,128
It's like, "We can't do anything to
get our guy in this open space back. "

470
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,291
JD:
And the music here. . .

471
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:19,442
. . .was the creation of Don Davis,
our second composer.

472
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:23,562
When you work with a first-time crew--
We had a first-time director. . .

473
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:27,284
. . .who was brilliant,
a first-time DP. . .

474
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:33,250
. . .basically, a first-time production
designer and a first-time composer.

475
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:36,371
The first-time composer
didn't work out.

476
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:40,123
So we had to go back
and bring Don Davis in. . .

477
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,087
. . .who came in with not a great amount
of time left.

478
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:48,645
He had six weeks to write the score
and get it orchestrated. . .

479
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:51,646
. . .and for us to cut it
into the picture.

480
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:55,283
We felt fortunate that so many
first-time people. . .

481
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,491
. . .so many were able
to do what was needed.

482
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:03,007
The element that didn't work,
we were able to replace.

483
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:07,087
WG: This is a scene that keeps you
on your toes as a producer.

484
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:11,645
We were supposed to shoot this
down in the hangar. . .

485
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:17,450
. . .but Gene had just had enough. It was
so loud and such bad conditions. . .

486
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:23,484
. . .that he didn't want to run
a two-page dialogue scene down there.

487
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:27,845
While John was shooting another scene,
we were running around. . .

488
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,762
. . .Iooking for a place,
and we found the admiral's bridge.

489
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:35,608
You never see a scene shot
in a real admiral's bridge.

490
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:40,210
Earlier in the scene, a plane lands
and it makes you go:

491
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:44,127
"Wow, they're shooting this
on an aircraft carrier. "

492
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:49,572
It worked out. There wasn't a lot of
room to move around with the camera.

493
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:54,484
We didn't have a choice.
Otherwise we wouldn't have our scenes.

494
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:58,925
JD: There's a lot of guerrilla
filmmaking involved in this movie.

495
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,089
Our director was up to that. . .

496
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:06,687
. . .because he was used to conditions
like this and preferred them.

497
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:15,923
WG: You're lugging cameras off
the deck, you're running around. . .

498
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:19,404
. . .you know, scout locating and. . .

499
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:23,925
. . .you do whatever needs
to sort of get things done.

500
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:29,250
You lose weight from running
on stairs. The food's not so good.

501
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:32,007
JD:
There's no elevators on carriers.

502
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:38,004
Only big ones on the outside that
carry up helicopters and aircraft.

503
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:40,847
WG:
This was shot in lovely California.

504
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,803
JD: We wanted to add an extra
scene once the movie was shot.

505
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,528
Create another little action
opportunity scenario.

506
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:56,247
I was sitting out there without sun--
Without a hat, or any suntan lotion.

507
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:59,450
It was 1 02 degrees
the day we shot this.

508
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:01,763
I got very sunburned.

509
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:05,329
I was amazed that we were able. . .

510
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:10,328
. . .to make this look like
it was shot in Slovakia.

511
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,410
This is all July. . .

512
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:16,043
. . .outside of Los Angeles,
Angeles National Forest.

513
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:22,164
WG: When we looked at it, between
the first and second radio contact. . .

514
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,244
. . .nothing happened for Owen.

515
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:29,089
Something happened for Gene,
he was told he had to move his guy.

516
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:32,006
Owen just ran through the woods.
We felt. . .

517
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:36,247
. . .we had to add something,
to put more tension in his voice. . .

518
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:40,412
. . .when he got news they weren't
gonna pick him up.

519
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,563
Here we are back in Slovakia.

520
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:58,202
JD: Now Owen, again, just worked
in unbearable conditions. . .

521
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:02,645
. . .given that most actors
are in a controlled environment. . .

522
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:07,005
. . .and aren't asked to do things
that Owen's been asked to do.

523
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:10,211
He just did it. He was a trooper.

524
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:14,042
It was never too much to ask,
he was always there.

525
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:19,242
He was always dirty and working
in dirty outdoor conditions. . .

526
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:22,525
. . .and up to the task.
I think that it shows.

527
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:27,045
When an actor really wants
to play a role and wants. . .

528
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:31,411
. . .to be in the moment,
his performance is reflective of that.

529
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,609
This guy didn't phone it in.

530
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:38,324
This is a guy who really wanted
you to believe his character. . .

531
00:39:38,573 --> 00:39:43,522
. . .and what he went through.
He suffered to create that for us.

532
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,171
No.

533
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:49,012
Negative. Negative.

534
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:56,011
JD: An actor like Owen makes your job
easier, except he's a great writer. . .

535
00:39:56,213 --> 00:40:00,365
. . .and he's gonna want to rewrite
his part. And other actors. . .

536
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:05,203
. . .will have to adjust to what
he comes up with. It's a challenge. . .

537
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:10,123
. . .to get him to plan far enough
ahead of time that everybody knows. . .

538
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:16,130
. . .and the actors can have rehearsed
what they'll do in relation to Owen.

539
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:20,252
Somebody who's willing
to give his all makes it easier.

540
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:23,405
WG:
When Owen signed on to do the movie. . .

541
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:28,482
. . .the character was more gung ho.
The Tom Cruise in Top Gun character.

542
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:32,562
Owen signed on after speaking
with us and the director. . .

543
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:36,652
. . .with the idea that we would
alter the character to fit. . .

544
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:41,967
. . .what he represented and what was
a contemporary American pilot.

545
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:45,883
We'd done some of the work,
but when he showed up. . .

546
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:49,887
. . .we had a ways to go.
We were rewriting opening scenes. . .

547
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:54,485
. . .where he's talking about
wanting to go fly for rock stars. . .

548
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:58,481
. . .when he got there.
When he showed up it was tense.

549
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:01,486
He'd throw out suggestions
and new scenes.

550
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:05,572
Part of our job was to figure out
which ones we could do. . .

551
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:10,249
. . .and talk to the studio because
most of them were great ideas. . .

552
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:13,451
. . .but some of them
had larger implications.

553
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:19,131
Was Gene gonna read it and go,
"This wasn't what I signed on for"?

554
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,611
At the end of the day, we negotiated
everything with everyone.

555
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:29,524
It satisfied Owen and Gene.
That's where we got to where we were.

556
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:33,402
JD: Now Owen's makeup and hair
ended up being. . .

557
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:39,125
. . .a very important point
of contention with the studio.

558
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:42,046
The studio is interested
in his look. . .

559
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:46,690
. . .from his haircut and the look
of his injuries when he's running.

560
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:49,572
They want him handsome enough. . .

561
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,611
. . .that people are gonna
want to look at him.

562
00:41:52,773 --> 00:41:56,527
We want it realistic
so people are gonna believe it.

563
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:01,011
So we took Owen out
and did a hair and makeup test.

564
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:03,807
We cut his hair
and we all looked at it.

565
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:06,049
And it didn't look right.

566
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:10,571
We had to cut it again,
which pissed off Owen.

567
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:16,528
After we got the hair set,
we went through the makeup tests.

568
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:20,766
It was getting Owen on location
and doing the makeup. . .

569
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:24,562
. . .and getting the studio the film.
Then they had input.

570
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:27,964
The director and the producers
all had. . .

571
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:31,443
. . .their perspective
on what it should be.

572
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:38,087
One of the big negotiations was
getting his hair and look right.

573
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:44,522
The nose is Owen's. There was no
prosthetic makeup applied there.

574
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,890
WG: We had him bloody
the first day of shooting.

575
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:49,845
The studio called, saying:

576
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:52,653
"We can't have him this bloodied up.

577
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,083
People aren't gonna want to watch.

578
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:59,047
You need to build
to a level of makeup. "

579
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:03,690
JD: That was a good point
on their part. Again, it's why. . .

580
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:07,488
. . .having a lot of perspective
on a film is helpful.

581
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:10,282
You just need one decision maker.

582
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:15,290
That's what the director should do
and what he did well here.

583
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:18,769
If people look at a film
from their perspective. . .

584
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:22,727
. . .people can have input
that's gonna be helpful.

585
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,412
Move.

586
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:26,565
REIGART:
They're right on him!

587
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:32,646
WG: I can explain
the part in the SCIF.

588
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:34,923
When we showed up to shoot this. . .

589
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:39,530
. . .the scene was about trying to
figure out which one was Burnett.

590
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:45,291
And Rodway, who plays our marine,
was the one who. . .

591
00:43:45,613 --> 00:43:48,730
. . .figured out which one was Owen.

592
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:52,283
We arrived and started
the video playback. . .

593
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:54,927
. . .which is a rear-projection screen. . .

594
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,567
. . .the actors were there going:

595
00:43:57,773 --> 00:44:00,492
"What are we saying?
That's clearly him. "

596
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:05,403
The design didn't fit and that
was the first time we saw it.

597
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:08,081
The actors were right.

598
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:12,605
John and I said, "Give us 1 0 minutes. "
And we ran off. . .

599
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:16,010
. . .got the script and rewrote it
as you see it. . .

600
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:21,128
. . .such that it's about, "What happened
to him, why did he quit moving?"

601
00:44:21,813 --> 00:44:27,410
On the ground here
in the mass graves, we had--

602
00:44:27,613 --> 00:44:29,365
There was graphic stuff.

603
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,451
Obviously we wanted
to make the film PG-1 3. . .

604
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:37,329
. . .so we really had to look
at the way it came out.

605
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:43,210
In John's initial cut there was tons
of shots of dead bodies and babies.

606
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:46,086
It really sort of pounded home. . .

607
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:50,002
. . .the gruesome nature of what
Burnett was going through.

608
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:56,607
We managed to pull that off without
having to show as much explicit stuff.

609
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:02,847
Right here you still get the sense
they're in a bunch of dead bodies.

610
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:06,165
JD:
John Moore earned his name Moore.

611
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:10,442
That's what he always
wanted was more.

612
00:45:10,693 --> 00:45:13,526
WG: When we said,
"You can't do this," he goes:

613
00:45:13,773 --> 00:45:16,606
"The name's not John Less,
it's John Moore. "

614
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:20,806
JD:
This is one of those instances. . .

615
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,130
. . .where the studio
was probably right.

616
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:30,681
He could've made the scene so horrific
that it would have been tough. . .

617
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:35,330
. . .for American audiences not to get
thrown out and be overwhelmed.

618
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:40,521
Yet he was able to create the horror
of what he wanted to do. . .

619
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,644
. . .without losing the scene.

620
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:47,011
It was a good compromise
on all parts here.

621
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,807
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

622
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:58,128
JD: The pilot who originally
got shot down in Bosnia. . .

623
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:02,685
. . .basically hid for three days.
And radioed in, got picked up. . .

624
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:05,527
. . .and never considered
himself a hero.

625
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:12,012
He did what he wanted to do, which
was survive. He was the first to say:

626
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:14,926
"I was not heroic,
it was just survival. "

627
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:19,132
This is a lot more active character.

628
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:23,207
This is a person who is
using his ingenuity. . .

629
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:29,050
. . .to really move himself around,
who is being aggressively pursued.

630
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:34,367
I don't think Scott O'Grady, after
his first encounter over there. . .

631
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:38,003
. . .was actually pursued.
I think he was able to hide.

632
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,488
WG:
Anyone involved in Scott's story. . .

633
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:44,083
. . .would look at this
and say not much is familiar.

634
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:46,443
We weren't intending it to be.

635
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:48,883
When he got shot down--

636
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:54,605
There have been numerous people
shot down over the years.

637
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,412
It lends itself
to an interesting movie.

638
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:02,932
JD: It did have an impact. We saw the
Discovery Channel piece on O'Grady.

639
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:06,245
I was most moved by
his family's reaction. . .

640
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:12,204
. . .not knowing if he was alive and
not knowing what would happen.

641
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:17,367
Having to sit through it with the rest
of the country-- It was very public.

642
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:22,165
And agonize over
what was gonna happen.

643
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:26,847
That really made us
want to bring the family into this.

644
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:31,325
The family was worked in
to create that perspective. . .

645
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:34,804
. . .because a lot of us
are fathers and wives. . .

646
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:41,009
. . .and could imagine having a son
trapped and the anguish we would feel.

647
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:43,010
--shot at, I believe him.

648
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:45,204
What do you expect me to do?

649
00:47:45,413 --> 00:47:47,847
Command says I gotta sit on my hands.

650
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:53,690
WG: The political construct
is fictional, not from Scott's story.

651
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:58,409
The whole idea that Gene Hackman's
under the thumb of NATO. . .

652
00:47:58,653 --> 00:48:03,010
. . .and can't do anything
through most of the movie.

653
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:06,723
We're part of a coalition,
and then we have to--

654
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:11,404
We can't just march in.
We have to think of the big picture.

655
00:48:11,653 --> 00:48:17,250
That was something the writer created
and allowed us to get Gene Hackman. . .

656
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:20,803
. . .because he created this
character on the ship.

657
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:29,001
JD: This is an important negotiation
we had with the DOD, right here.

658
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:31,807
It was over whether Gene. . .

659
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:37,451
. . .is gonna pick up the phone
in the next couple of seconds or not.

660
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:42,403
The basis of that was
the Department of Defense felt. . .

661
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:48,643
. . .Iike Gene's character, if he picked
up the phone, would be insubordinate.

662
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:54,729
He would be using the press
in a manner that wasn't military.

663
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,252
It happens a lot.

664
00:48:56,493 --> 00:48:59,803
WG: What's funny is, for the
regular audience member. . .

665
00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:05,406
. . .this is a heroic thing Gene does.
It's one thing people are cheering.

666
00:49:05,653 --> 00:49:07,245
He figured out a way. . .

667
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:11,930
. . .to propel the movie forward,
to propel his cause forward.

668
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,852
Look at it from
the military standpoint.

669
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:18,403
They think he's breaking
the chain of command.

670
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:23,403
JD: So the negotiation resolved itself,
he looks at the card. . .

671
00:49:23,653 --> 00:49:27,851
. . .and doesn't pick up the phone,
you cut to the reporter.

672
00:49:28,053 --> 00:49:30,613
AERNOUT: It's also unclear what,
if any impact--

673
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:33,443
WG:
This is Aernout Van Lynden. . .

674
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:38,607
. . .a famous European reporter
for Sky News.

675
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:41,202
John Moore grew up idolizing him. . .

676
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:46,049
. . .because he was in Lebanon and
these horrible situations reporting.

677
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:49,728
When we got to Slovakia, he said,
"I want Van Lynden. "

678
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:53,648
He called the guy and said,
"We've got a reporter. . .

679
00:49:53,893 --> 00:49:57,408
. . .I'd like you to play him. "
Aernout got down there.

680
00:49:57,613 --> 00:50:01,925
Unfortunately, he had to leave
about halfway through production. . .

681
00:50:02,093 --> 00:50:07,611
. . .because the fighting began in lsrael
and he went to cover it.

682
00:50:18,893 --> 00:50:24,206
JD: Originally we were gonna do
the entire movie in English.

683
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:31,572
The decision was made
to subtitle the Bosnian soldiers.

684
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:36,085
It created a problem because we
had to teach them the language.

685
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:39,922
WG: We had cast the movie thinking
that they were. . .

686
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:43,244
. . .going to speak English
with phony accents.

687
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:45,927
And the studio said:

688
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:51,122
"You know what, for authenticity's
sake they should speak the language. "

689
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:57,010
The problem was the actors
we had cast didn't speak Croatian.

690
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:00,011
We had--
We had to bring in translators. . .

691
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:04,411
. . .teach them the lines.
It was all very last-minute.

692
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:08,652
JD: And I was quite nervous
because I once did a movie. . .

693
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:12,363
. . .where we had to teach
Japanese actors English. . .

694
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:18,804
. . .because the director felt everybody
should be speaking the same language.

695
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:23,450
And the Japanese who
learned English for the picture. . .

696
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,526
. . .could never get
that moment of connection right.

697
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:31,732
It was like a one- or two-second
disconnect delay. . .

698
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:35,203
. . .where they would deliver
their lines.

699
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:38,729
Which we couldn't render
in the editorial process.

700
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:42,608
We were quite nervous here,
but it worked out great.

701
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:44,724
WG:
There's precedents for both.

702

Hunt for Red October and
Clear and Present Danger...

703
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:52,248
. . .those movies figured out a way
for you to believe. . .

704
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:56,122
. . .the foreign-speaking characters
would speak English.

705
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,727
They filmically used devices.

706
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:04,326
There are World War Il movies that
have the characters speaking German.

707
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:05,762
It was a tossup.

708
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:08,407
JD:
I hope Bosnian critics don't kill us.

709
00:52:08,613 --> 00:52:12,003
WG: For accent.
JD: Yeah, exactly.

710
00:52:12,693 --> 00:52:15,207
WG:
We're coming into the mine sequence. . .

711
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:18,450
. . .which was one
of the action sequences. . .

712
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:24,325
. . .where we thought we weren't gonna
be able to do for budgetary reasons.

713
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:31,170
At the last minute, we found a location
and a way to shoot it affordably.

714
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:35,127
It's some people's favorite
sequence in the movie.

715
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:37,204
JD:
It's one of my favorites.

716
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:42,447
I never imagined this sequence
this way when the script was written.

717
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:46,003
And the sequence we had
was pretty exciting.

718
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:48,807
But this is even more visual.

719
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:51,004
It was a great solution.

720

Constantly, when you don't
have enough resources. . .

721
00:52:55,093 --> 00:52:58,449
. . .there are solutions that
are creative and better.

If you throw too much money
at a movie in a situation. . .

723
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:06,406
. . .the movie can really
not reach its potential.

724
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:10,492
A lot of times, when you
have to compromise and improvise. . .

725
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:13,645
. . .you come up
with fabulous solutions.

WG: We actually did soil
and air samples from this location.

727
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:22,006
It was a Communist-era
industrial factory.

728
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:26,041
Nobody could tell us what
they were manufacturing. . .

729
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:28,363
. . .when we scouted the location.

730
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:31,645
We were thinking,
"We better check this out. "

That's a thing to worry about. . .

. . .when you go to
a formerly Soviet-occupied country.

You're going to factories and places

You've got to expect the unexpected. . .

a tight budget. . .

00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:12,922
. . .and a first-time director,
you need time to plan.

742
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:15,363
The more time you have to plan. . .

743
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:19,048
. . .the more you're in control
of being able to deal. . .

. . .with contingencies and problems
that are gonna come up. . .

. . .and a short shooting schedule.

746
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:30,484
We had no money on this movie
and very short days.

747
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:34,766
The director wanted a winter look
which helped the movie.

748
00:54:34,973 --> 00:54:38,568
That gave us very little sunlight
to deal with.

This was the bullet buffeted.

Very difficult to get in-camera.

a lot of times. . .

754
00:54:59,253 --> 00:55:02,404
. . .they don't understand budget.

00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:24,971
REIGART OVER RADIO:
The hard bit's over. You--

783
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:31,282
WG: This is one of the scenes
where it originally was written. . .

784
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:35,845
. . .in a way in which Owen
kind of loses it for a second.

785
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:42,328
He is sleep-deprived and
he makes a reference to his pilot. . .

786
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:46,247
. . .that implies that he kind of thinks
he's still alive.

787
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:51,408
That spurned Hackman into saying,
"Let's talk about something else. "

788
00:57:51,613 --> 00:57:56,403
He snaps him back into it
and gets his head back into it.

789
00:57:57,893 --> 00:58:01,249
We looked at it and the studio felt. . .

790
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:05,731
. . .that we didn't support
that idea through the movie.

791
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:11,206
That he was at a place where he would
literally lose his mind for a minute.

792
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:16,208
Because he snapped back into it,
they didn't feel like it worked.

793
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:20,122
So we had Owen instead,
off camera, reference. . .

794
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:24,446
. . .that he's feeling guilty
about leaving Stackhouse behind.

795
00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:27,412
--garbled.
Let's talk about your gear.

796
00:58:27,613 --> 00:58:30,002
How's it holding up?

797
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:40,492
JD: It's important for a producer to
give a sense of comfort to an actor.

798
00:58:40,693 --> 00:58:45,005
That there's somebody to talk to
when he needs to complain.

799
00:58:46,213 --> 00:58:49,842
It's important that a producer
doesn't get involved. . .

800
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:54,564
. . .with an actor's performance.
But that he talks to the director.

801
00:58:55,173 --> 00:58:57,767
And that the director communicates.

802
00:58:57,973 --> 00:59:00,851
You can create anarchy
on a set otherwise.

803
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:05,803
I think that certain actors are
trying to please multiple people.

804
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:08,402
That can create a tough situation.

805
00:59:08,613 --> 00:59:14,051
You're with an actor to make them feel
warm, comfortable and supported.

806
00:59:14,293 --> 00:59:17,126
You're there when they have a problem.

807
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:21,647
It's important that any
performance-related questions. . .

808
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:25,647
. . .go to the director
and the director communicates them.

809
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:32,162
I've seen producers talk to actors
to give input on performance.

810
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,690
I really think that it is
a bastardization of what we do.

811
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:41,801
WG: Whenever Owen had any big
problems with the script. . .

812
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:48,327
. . .John, he and I would hash it out
so that we were on the same page.

813
00:59:48,573 --> 00:59:53,806
A thing that can happen is the
director can go off with the actor.

814
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:58,564
All of a sudden they're shooting
and you're not recognizing the scene.

815
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:00,805
We tried to avoid that.

816
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:04,005
JD: The director has a responsibility
to let you know. . .

817
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:07,843
. . .if he's gonna make any changes
to the script.

818
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:19,004
The score in this movie could be
an essential additional element.

819
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:25,010
This is one of those movies where
a score makes it 1 0 or 1 50/0 better.

820
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:28,131
You want to take advantage
of that if you can.

821
01:00:28,373 --> 01:00:32,810
There's emotional moments that
the score can help drive home.

822
01:00:33,013 --> 01:00:37,643
They can create a theme,
a sense of movement of action.

823
01:00:37,893 --> 01:00:42,045
And I think that if
the score's working right. . .

824
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:46,605
. . .the overall movie is gonna just
feel more organically whole.

825
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:50,129
--then return to the helo.

826
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:51,561
This is Colonel--

827
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:58,326
WG: For this scene we had little time.
We had to get it in one shot.

828
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:02,612
John put it on a Steadicam
and revolved around them.

829
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:06,323
It may have not been the way
he wanted to design it.

830
01:01:06,693 --> 01:01:10,368
With three characters talking,
you want to shoot all three.

831
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:15,687
Due to the situation and planes
landing, we just had to get the scene.

832
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:20,290
We were gonna be off the ship
in two days and couldn't make it up.

833
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:24,526
That's a case of a first-time director
thinking on his feet. . .

834
01:01:24,693 --> 01:01:30,006
. . .trying to make a problem
into an asset.

835
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:36,205
JD: Getting back to the music--
The process was very interactive.

836
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:41,612
Don Davis would score a piece of the
movie and we would go to his house.

837
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:44,890
He has a studio.
And we would listen to it.

838
01:01:45,053 --> 01:01:48,363
We'd comment, he'd make changes
and we'd come back.

839
01:01:48,573 --> 01:01:52,851
He worked with us.
It's most like the script process. . .

840
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:56,608
. . .I've ever experienced
with music before.

841
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:02,185
We had a short time
to get it to work right.

842
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:06,665
The composer was willing
to work with everybody.

843
01:02:06,913 --> 01:02:10,826
I think we were able to quickly
take a part of the movie. . .

844
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:15,111
. . .that was in disastrous shape
and turn it into a plus.

845
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:20,271
WG: Coming up here is one
of my favorite scenes.

846
01:02:20,473 --> 01:02:23,351
The scene in the back of the truck.

847
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:27,023
Which was intended and
I think accomplished. . .

848
01:02:27,233 --> 01:02:31,351
. . .in making you feel the surreality
of what Owen's going for. . .

849
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,589
. . .and the oddness of this place.

850
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:37,308
The fact that the kids
in the back of the truck. . .

851
01:02:37,473 --> 01:02:40,670
. . .are drinking Coke
and listen to rap music.

852
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:47,067
There's this bizarre disconnect with
what he's doing, trying to survive.

853
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:50,031
Suddenly, he's in a truck
with teenagers.

854
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:53,583
Who are still teenagers,
even though they're--

855
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:59,072
JD: Originally we wanted to introduce
the idea they're weekend warriors.

856
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:03,465
They're holding down jobs
and conducting everyday lives.

857
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:06,392
And on the weekends they go fight.

858
01:03:06,593 --> 01:03:09,949
And originally we had
a great scene constructed. . .

859
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:14,146
. . .where he fell into a foxhole
with some weekend warriors.

860
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:17,823
They were talking about
having tickets for a concert.

861
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:23,147
They were conversing and it really
created a connection between. . .

862
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:26,673
. . .the reality of war
and everyday life.

863
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:31,748
This was a good solution.
We couldn't do in the new script. . .

864
01:03:31,993 --> 01:03:34,143
. . .that same series of scenes.

865
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,347
I think that this really drove home. . .

866
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:42,189
. . .the idea that this war in
particular had part-time combatants.

867
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:47,343
WG: It's also the time in the movie
where Owen makes a connection. . .

868
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:52,428
. . .with the people of the country who
are the victims of what's going on.

869
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:56,421
He has an opportunity to see
what they're going through.

870
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:59,864
It ties you in emotionally
to what's happening. . .

871
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:04,311
. . .rather than it just being
pure action the whole way through.

872
01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:10,106
JD: There's a scene coming up
where Owen pulls out a Coke.

873
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:13,663
I've been asked
if Coke paid us for that.

874
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:17,952
-They didn't. They got free publicity.
WG: Right.

875
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:23,909
-You have water?
-Water?

876
01:04:24,113 --> 01:04:27,230
WG: These actors in the truck
are guys we found. . .

877
01:04:27,393 --> 01:04:31,068
. . .just local high-school actors
in Bratislava.

878
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:36,262
She's actually
a stunt woman in Slovakia.

879
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:40,632
As you'll see coming up,
she'll have reason to use her skills.

880
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:45,662
All of them were just people we'd
called in before shooting and said:

881
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,745
"Do you want to be
in an American movie?"

882
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:54,581
The kid, Babic, I think
really has a great presence.

883
01:04:54,833 --> 01:05:00,590
They're all such sweet kids who had
never been in a movie, obviously.

884
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:02,272
BABIC:
--NWA, Public Enemy.

885
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:05,465
WG: They had fun
and Owen had fun with them.

886
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:11,822
He appreciated the fact that they
were not really actors, but doing it.

887
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:16,311
JD: Kind of doing it for the first
time in a big American movie.

888
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:18,708
BURNETT:
That's good. That's good.

889
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:23,826
JD: Helicopters drove us nuts
because John. . .

890
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:29,070
. . .was such a military enthusiast.

891
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:33,585
He so knows his details
that if a nose cone wasn't right. . .

892
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:36,870
. . .he wouldn't shoot with us.
So we went all over. . .

893
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:39,229
. . .making sure the helicopters. . .

894
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:42,227
. . .were authentic,
including the nose cones.

895
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:47,587
WG: Hach, which was built from scratch
by the production designer.

896
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:50,429
This you'll see on the DVD. . .

897
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:54,347
. . .there's a much more intense version
with more violence.

898
01:05:54,553 --> 01:05:58,785
This is the one area of the movie
where John just went for it.

899
01:05:58,993 --> 01:06:02,702
He wanted it to feel like warfare.

900
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:06,667
He wanted everything to feel
as harsh, brutal and loud. . .

901
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:09,985
. . .as anything anyone had seen before.

902
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:15,671
And when we saw the first cut,
it was fantastic. But it was R-rated.

903
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:20,303
That's when we had to start
to make the decision:

904
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:24,432
"Is this a film we want
to release PG-1 3 or R-rated?"

905
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:26,942
And we released it as a PG-1 3.

906
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:31,749
JD: For my tastes, the longer version
was a little too gratuitous.

907
01:06:31,953 --> 01:06:32,988
WG:
And I loved it.

908
01:06:33,153 --> 01:06:34,268
[MAN LAUGHS]

909
01:06:39,993 --> 01:06:44,987
WG: We shot this entire sequence in
Hach in five days, five shooting days.

910
01:06:46,153 --> 01:06:47,347
Both the interior--

911
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:51,347
JD: These are the only women
in the movie, the ones seen here.

912
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:52,952
I'm sorry, go ahead.

913
01:06:53,193 --> 01:06:55,502
WG:
The interiors we shot last.

914
01:06:55,713 --> 01:07:00,150
We actually shot that part
you just saw, the destruction, first.

915
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:04,949
Then we went and got these dialogue
scenes and the action inside.

916
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:07,303
It was at the end of the shoot.

917
01:07:07,513 --> 01:07:10,630
We were all extremely exhausted. . .

918
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:14,223
. . .and at our wits' end.
Fights every day.

919
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:15,582
EJUP:
Of what?

920
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:21,382
JD: This is being shot
close to Christmas, year 2000.

921
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:26,502
There was a determined attempt
to finish and get everybody home. . .

922
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,385
. . .for Christmas.

923
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:32,063
That was the movie's theme,
"Be home by Christmas. "

924
01:07:32,273 --> 01:07:38,587
WG: John would've liked more time
to shoot this, but it was impossible.

925
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:43,066
People had scheduled trips back.
They were on to other movies.

926
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:47,903
We were shooting into the night.
That's why we shot interiors last. . .

927
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:52,544
. . .because we knew we could
control it and go longer if we had to.

928
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:57,429
We ended up getting it in five days,
which was kind of a miracle.

929
01:07:57,633 --> 01:08:00,705
America government for shit! Now go!

930
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:10,150
WG: We brought that tank in
and had to do that shot three times. . .

931
01:08:10,313 --> 01:08:12,622
. . .to get the explosion just right.

932
01:08:12,953 --> 01:08:15,990
There's a huge safety issue
with tanks.

933
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:22,263
You've got them moving around, you've
got soldiers who drive the tanks. . .

934
01:08:22,513 --> 01:08:28,190
. . .trying to listen to a first AD
who doesn't know their language.

935
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:32,312
We'd have to clear everything out
while moving the tanks. . .

936
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,225
. . .to get them in position.

937
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:39,746
But obviously, safety's first,
and that slowed us down quite a bit.

938
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:41,744
JD:
I always wanted my own tank.

939
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:46,344
It'd be a great thing to drive
your kids to school in.

940
01:08:46,553 --> 01:08:48,942
WG: You could probably buy one.
I think they're on the market.

941
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:50,102
JD:
Yeah.

942
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,708
WG:
This area here is on the DVD.

943
01:08:55,873 --> 01:09:01,266
You'll see where the more brutal
execution-style violence came in.

944
01:09:01,473 --> 01:09:04,863
That was a problem.
You can have violence. . .

945
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:10,101
. . .but when they're pure executions,
that sends you over into the R rating.

946
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:14,142
People look at this
and wonder how this is PG-1 3.

947
01:09:14,393 --> 01:09:18,989
But that's a negotiation,
it's our job and the studio's job. . .

948
01:09:19,233 --> 01:09:22,111
. . .to show them a version,
make some trims.

949
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:25,391
And get to a place
where you get the rating. . .

950
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:30,149
. . .but you've also gotten
the movie you want.

951
01:09:35,433 --> 01:09:38,789
JD: It's not collaborative.
The board will look at it. . .

952
01:09:38,993 --> 01:09:42,986
. . .say what the rating is and
tell you what their issues are.

953
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:45,349
Then you go and address them.

954
01:09:45,593 --> 01:09:51,065
You can do it partially and re-submit
and sometimes get the rating you want.

955
01:09:51,873 --> 01:09:56,424
There's a theory that if you submit
enough, they'll get tired of it. . .

956
01:09:56,673 --> 01:09:58,903
. . .and give you what you need.

957
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:03,984
They see the film, come up with
a judgement and give you their notes.

958
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:07,822
It's like a ref at a football game
who calls holding.

959
01:10:07,993 --> 01:10:11,668
It's in the eye of the beholder.
Was that holding or not?

960
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:17,343
So it's good that you can re-submit.
Sometimes you can negotiate.

961
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:21,108
Because sometimes
their first opinions. . .

962
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:25,550
. . .will be somewhat difficult
to understand.

963
01:10:28,313 --> 01:10:31,544
WG: One of the things that got
us through Hach was. . .

964
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:34,512
. . .we had about four units shooting.

965
01:10:34,673 --> 01:10:39,588
We had a second unit shooting
outside while we were inside.

966
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:44,384
We had an aerial unit shooting
some of the helicopter air-to-air.

967
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:46,863
And a unit shooting the inserts.

968
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:50,427
By the end of the show in Slovakia. . .

969
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:56,431
. . .we had anybody who could
hold a camera shooting some stuff.

970
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,589
JD: There's a lot of guerrilla
filmmaking that went on.

971
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:05,065
It helped having a director
who was used to picking up a camera. . .

972
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:07,224
. . .and shooting it himself.

973
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:10,711
That enabled us to do a lot of this.

974
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:16,743
The first-time DP, Brendan Galvin,
did a spectacular job.

975
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:19,143
He could move so quickly. . .

976
01:11:19,353 --> 01:11:24,985
. . .and could light a scene without
using a tremendous amount of lights.

977
01:11:25,233 --> 01:11:27,952
It was very helpful.

978
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:37,790
We saw tests of the film. The DP
came out and auditioned for us. . .

979
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:43,983
. . .shot the film and makeup tests.
We saw early shots on the mountain. . .

980
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,942
. . .with Owen that we did
before we started the movie.

981
01:11:48,153 --> 01:11:51,225
Always impressed with what
he was able to do.

982
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:56,746
I think he's wonderful. The look
is fresh and works well for the film.

983
01:11:56,953 --> 01:12:00,389
Cinematography and the idea
worked well together.

984
01:12:00,873 --> 01:12:05,503
WG: Well, obviously it was such
an external, an outdoor movie. . .

985
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:11,703
. . .we were relying upon the weather
and what was expected at the time.

986
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:15,025
It was the warmest,
driest winter they'd had. . .

987
01:12:15,433 --> 01:12:16,707
. . .in 55 years.

988
01:12:16,913 --> 01:12:20,303
We went in thinking
we'd be shooting in the snow. . .

989
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:25,069
. . .and clouds, which would've helped.
But a lot of times it'd be sunny.

990
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:29,511
We'd have to throw up some screens
or wait for a cloud.

991
01:12:29,753 --> 01:12:32,745
The weather didn't help
him at all. . .

992
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:36,070
. . .and the third act
takes place in the snow.

993
01:12:36,233 --> 01:12:40,272
We'd fully expected it to be
all real snow by then.

994
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:43,186
But a lot of it we had to make.

995
01:12:47,753 --> 01:12:52,304
JD: Somebody's always watching,
the producer or line producer.

996
01:12:52,513 --> 01:12:56,392
You can very easily
get your day re-positioned. . .

997
01:12:56,593 --> 01:13:00,268
. . .or destroyed based on what happens.

998
01:13:00,513 --> 01:13:04,142
Rain, in a situation where
you're not expecting it. . .

999
01:13:04,353 --> 01:13:08,187
. . .and you can't move to a cover set,
can cost you a day.

1000
01:13:08,353 --> 01:13:11,663
And there's no such thing
as weather insurance.

1001
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:15,587
Weather's a factor.
Sometimes a studio will forgive you. . .

1002
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:18,552
. . .if it was beyond your control.

1003
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:22,262
An act of nature
and you just didn't get your day.

1004
01:13:22,513 --> 01:13:24,469
Sometimes they won't relent.

1005
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,864
They'll go, "You had 55 days
to shoot, that's it. "

1006
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:32,504
And you won't wanna have to take
pages out or compromise a scene.

1007
01:13:32,873 --> 01:13:36,183
So you always have a cover set.

1008
01:13:36,353 --> 01:13:41,302
But it can take two or three hours
to get to it, so it's not useful.

1009
01:13:41,553 --> 01:13:45,910
Weather can play a big factor
on how much time you have to shoot.

1010
01:13:46,153 --> 01:13:51,625
WG: On this, we rarely had a cover set.
Because of Gene's schedule. . .

1011
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:56,748
. . .we shot all this stuff on the skiff
over the course of four weeks. . .

1012
01:13:56,953 --> 01:13:59,911
. . .and the rest
of the movie is outdoors.

1013
01:14:00,153 --> 01:14:04,624
So we were really at the whims
of the weather.

1014
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:09,270
We were always told by the studio,
"You can't wait for clouds.

1015
01:14:09,473 --> 01:14:13,261
You can't say you're not
shooting because it's sunny. "

1016
01:14:13,713 --> 01:14:15,908
We kind of made the best of it.

1017
01:14:16,153 --> 01:14:21,307
For the most part, you don't notice
the continuity problems.

1018
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:25,592
JD: They showed a Jack Lemmon film,
Days of Wine and Roses...

1019
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:29,871
. . .where the film was shot at
"golden hour," as the sun sets.

1020
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:35,426
I was amazed they could schedule it
so they'd shoot only those two hours.

1021
01:14:35,673 --> 01:14:39,507
You couldn't do that given
the cost of modern filmmaking.

1022
01:14:40,113 --> 01:14:45,506
You can't wait for your weather,
especially with this price-range film.

1023
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:51,066
You've just gotta work with the hand
you're dealt with.

1024
01:14:51,273 --> 01:14:55,186
REPORTER: This is bound to spoil
NA TO's hope of an exit from the--

1025
01:14:56,553 --> 01:15:02,867
JD: Don Davis' music helped create
an additional emotional component.

1026
01:15:03,113 --> 01:15:07,868
AERNOUT: --Burnett's death comes
as another blow.

1027
01:15:08,113 --> 01:15:10,104
JD:
David Keith was a real champ.

1028
01:15:10,273 --> 01:15:13,709
He took the movie
back to the Carl Vinson...

1029
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:17,070
. . .right in the middle
of the Afghan War.

1030
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:22,791
And we had a premiere on the deck
of the Carl Vinson for the crew.

1031
01:15:23,713 --> 01:15:28,662
WG: We promised we'd find
them wherever they were at the time. . .

1032
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:33,304
. . .so they could see it first because
a lot of them are in the movie.

1033
01:15:33,473 --> 01:15:38,501
A lot of the guys on deck and in
the football scene are from the ship.

1034
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:43,586
They really appreciated it.

1035
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:47,106
It was great for them
to be a part of it.

1036
01:15:47,353 --> 01:15:50,550
JD: Owen accidentally shot down
the helicopter. . .

1037
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,704
. . .when he was firing his gun.

1038
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:56,866
We needed a new helicopter
after take two.

1039
01:15:57,873 --> 01:16:00,262
That's why he cusses there.

1040
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:03,382
You've got to be shitting me!

1041
01:16:03,553 --> 01:16:09,025
WG: This is in Kosice, Slovakia.
It was probably our most--

1042
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:14,591
It's a city in northeast Slovakia,
close to the Ukraine border.

1043
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:19,668
Basically they found a potato field
and threw them out there.

1044
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:23,064
It was towards the end
of production. . .

1045
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:27,272
. . .and we wanted to get that
sort of stark look.

1046
01:16:29,473 --> 01:16:33,671
JD: John Moore took a helicopter
and literally searched. . .

1047
01:16:33,913 --> 01:16:39,590
. . .over a two-week period
every inch of Slovakia. . .

1048
01:16:39,953 --> 01:16:44,105
. . .to make sure he had locations
that really optimized. . .

1049
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:47,106
. . .what he wanted to do
in those settings.

1050
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,470
The look of the film is a testimony. . .

1051
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:53,670
. . .in how dogged he was
in doing his research.

1052
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:58,509
And the fact that he had
a helicopter to scout locations.

1053
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:04,863
WG: He actually took the helicopter
and took it to Croatia.

1054
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:07,945
He wasn't satisfied with Slovakia.

1055
01:17:08,193 --> 01:17:12,664
JD: We found out and said, "Don't
think you're gonna shoot in Croatia.

1056
01:17:12,913 --> 01:17:14,710
-We can't get insured there.
WG: Permits.

1057
01:17:14,953 --> 01:17:18,912
JD: We can't get permits
and the studio will have a fit.

1058
01:17:19,153 --> 01:17:22,748
So get your ass back to Slovakia. "

1059
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:27,983
I think that he was gonna see
if he could fool us a little bit.

1060
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:33,665
Like we wouldn't know where the border
was or notice we were in Croatia.

1061
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:35,904
WG:
This originally was scripted--

1062
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:40,828
One of the things we wanted
to capture with the Tracker's suit. . .

1063
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:46,312
. . .it was supposed to be
a Sarajevo Olympic sweat suit. . .

1064
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:50,705
. . .and this was to be an Olympic
memorial. But we couldn't get. . .

1065
01:17:50,873 --> 01:17:56,903
. . .the Olympics to let us use
their logo, the four, five rings.

1066
01:17:57,113 --> 01:17:59,911
And we couldn't get that signet. . .

1067
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:04,061
. . .of the Sarajevo Olympics,
so we had to fudge it.

1068
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:06,548
That was one battle we lost.

1069
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:12,472
The Tracker's backstory is that
he was a biathlete in the Olympics.

1070
01:18:13,353 --> 01:18:18,666
And now, given civil war, he's using
his talents for his own purposes.

1071
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:22,661
Instead of shooting at targets
he's shooting at people.

1072
01:18:22,993 --> 01:18:25,029
You'll be safer here.

1073
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:38,469
JD: It was another tattoo from a
concentration camp that he could be. . .

1074
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:42,871
. . .identified with the person
you thought was Burnett.

1075
01:18:43,113 --> 01:18:48,062
WG: The tattoo he has in Hach
and shows people is one moments. . .

1076
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:54,343
. . .where you realize he's a badass.
He's been to prison, he's out now.

1077
01:18:54,593 --> 01:19:00,304
It was a fun way to give you his
backstory without being expository.

1078
01:19:00,473 --> 01:19:03,226
This is a guy that's not a nice guy.

1080
01:19:27,713 --> 01:19:32,389
WG: The most difficult physical
production by far was this scene. . .

1081
01:19:32,713 --> 01:19:34,385
. . .on the frozen lake.

1082
01:19:34,593 --> 01:19:39,303
We had to build this frozen lake
with wax.

1083
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:44,507
And it took probably four days longer
than we thought it would. . .

1084
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,307
. . .to shoot this sequence coming up.

1085
01:19:47,513 --> 01:19:52,143
So many things, with the Army coming
in and the helicopter footage. . .

1086
01:19:52,313 --> 01:19:54,702
. . .and the guns having to work.

1087
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,707
And it was freezing. We were
into the heart of winter here.

1088
01:19:58,953 --> 01:20:01,672
We only had seven hours of daylight.

1089
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:06,270
And it was really brutal conditions.

1090
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:11,263
This was the biggest hurdle to get
over from a production standpoint.

1091
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:16,188
By the end of it
we were all dead tired.

01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:25,747
WG: The snow here is all fake.
It's manufactured snow.

1095
01:20:26,073 --> 01:20:32,069
The lake he slid on was made
with a sort of wood base underneath.

1096
01:20:32,313 --> 01:20:35,544
The art director and production
designer poured. . .

1097
01:20:35,713 --> 01:20:40,104
. . .thousands of gallons of hot wax
and had to let it dry.

1098
01:20:40,313 --> 01:20:44,192
Every couple of days,
it'd get torn up from filming on it.

1099
01:20:44,353 --> 01:20:50,030
The night before they'd pour another
layer of wax to give that lake a feel.

1100
01:20:50,193 --> 01:20:55,142
The reason we have a lake up there
is because John said, rightly so:

1101
01:20:55,313 --> 01:21:00,068
"The rescue can't take place
if the helicopters can put down. "

1102
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:04,988
Because that's what they would do.
They'd put down, hop out and fight.

1103
01:21:05,153 --> 01:21:08,463
We weren't gonna be able
to construct a sequence. . .

1104
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:14,230
. . .where you had to have an entire
Bosnian military on one side. . .

1105
01:21:14,553 --> 01:21:18,432
. . .but to also shoot the action
of the U.S. military.

1106
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:23,224
It was more effective to have
them fight the battle from the air.

1107
01:21:23,433 --> 01:21:28,553
We put Owen on a frozen lake
to explain why they can't put down. . .

1108
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:34,669
. . .which you'll hear Hackman
or one of his soldiers say later.

1109
01:21:36,073 --> 01:21:40,908
JD: This is one of my favorite shots
coming up. This is the elevator. . .

1110
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:45,863
. . .on the aircraft carrier that moves
the equipment up and down.

1111
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:49,469
And in a moment you'll see
the opposite elevator.

1112
01:21:49,673 --> 01:21:55,782
John has his camera on the elevator,
giving us this great shot of Gene.

1113
01:21:56,033 --> 01:22:00,265
Those elevators move up and down
incredibly quickly.

1114
01:22:00,513 --> 01:22:05,667
WG: They transport the planes
from the hangar bay onto the deck.

1115

She's a member of the military
from the Carl Vinson...

1116
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:15,342
. . .who we cast when we arrived
on the ship.

1117
01:22:15,593 --> 01:22:18,027
-How long has that been on?
ANALYST: Seven minutes.

1118
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,269
You've gotta be very familiar--

1119
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:25,268
JD: Again, this is all constructed
in Slovakia. . .

1120
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:28,425
. . .where Gene is right now
on a sound stage.

1121
01:22:30,073 --> 01:22:33,986
And the detail and the realism
they were able to capture. . .

1122
01:22:34,593 --> 01:22:37,630
. . .when you go on the actual ship,
was amazing.

1123
01:22:37,793 --> 01:22:41,468
Again, this is all on a sound stage.
All this stuff.

1124
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:44,511
WG: This is a real satisfying point
in the movie.

1125
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:50,384
Unlike a lot of Gene's roles, he's
been fairly impotent in this movie.

1126
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,305
We got a great reaction. . .

1127
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:56,069
. . .when he finally makes
the decision to go.

1128
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:06,666
The Tracker leaving Bazda to die.
This used to be a larger story line.

1129
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:12,670
The Tracker's competition with Bazda,
who's Lokar's right-hand man.

1130
01:23:12,913 --> 01:23:18,192
At some point the idea was that Lokar,
feeling the noose tighten. . .

1131
01:23:18,513 --> 01:23:23,223
. . .starts to weed-out the people
that could turn on him later.

1132
01:23:23,553 --> 01:23:29,583
The idea was-- In the scene earlier,
by the memorial, we cut this out. . .

1133
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:32,870
. . .he tells the Tracker,
"Take Bazda with you. "

1134
01:23:33,033 --> 01:23:35,672
You get the sense he's gonna kill him.

1135
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:46,621
JD: Sometimes there are subplots
you write in a script.

1136
01:23:47,073 --> 01:23:50,509
When the movie's put together,
it's too long. . .

1137
01:23:50,753 --> 01:23:54,792
. . .and the subplot isn't as important
as you thought it was.

1138
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:58,549
So those subplots get minimized. . .

1139
01:23:58,753 --> 01:24:03,065
. . .so other story elements
can move at a better pace.

1140
01:24:06,073 --> 01:24:12,228
WG: This actor playing Bazda is
a local Bratislavan actor named Marko.

1141
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:15,272
I forgot his last name.
He was fantastic.

1142
01:24:15,513 --> 01:24:20,985
We brought Eyde Belasco,
our Fox casting director, to Slovakia.

1143
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:27,422
And she and I looked for local talent
while John scouted locations.

1144
01:24:27,593 --> 01:24:30,903
We'd find somebody
and throw them in front of John.

1145
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:34,071
He'd sort of go, "Yes, no, yes, no. "

1146
01:24:34,273 --> 01:24:39,631

and a great sort of. . .

JD: It's amazing that we constructed
this entire lake.

1150
01:24:49,433 --> 01:24:53,949
Shooting in Slovakia gave us
the ability to do things. . .

1151
01:24:54,273 --> 01:24:57,345
. . .budget-wise we could never
do anyplace else.

1152
01:24:57,513 --> 01:25:00,823
WG:
lncredibly great construction guys.

1153
01:25:00,993 --> 01:25:04,952
Real talented in the building area.

1154
01:25:05,113 --> 01:25:08,310
--I want to make
one thing clear before we leave.

1155
01:25:08,473 --> 01:25:14,628
JD: Gene worked with us a number
of weeks on the location in Slovakia.

1156
01:25:14,793 --> 01:25:20,470
And then we convinced him to work on
the carrier, which was months later.

1157
01:25:20,633 --> 01:25:24,785
We got four days with him there.
What we were concerned with. . .

1158
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:28,787
. . .is when one arrives or leaves
the carrier at sea. . .

1159
01:25:28,953 --> 01:25:34,073
. . .you have to land on an airplane
that gets catapulted off. . .

from zero to 1 30 in a couple seconds.

1161
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,427
And Gene is 71 years old,
but he was up for it. . .

1162
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:46,466
. . .and endured all that stress.

1163
01:25:48,873 --> 01:25:52,912
WG: I was more than happy to walk on,
wait, and walk off the boat.

01:25:53,073 --> 01:25:56,952
Not in a hurry to hop
on that COD plane they had for him.

JD: Where you take off backwards
and have all that G-force.

1166
01:26:06,473 --> 01:26:09,226
WG: We actually shot
on two aircraft carriers.

1167
01:26:09,393 --> 01:26:12,590
One where we shot the actors
and a second one. . .

1168
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:17,873
. . .that was even busier than this one.
John Moore actually went. . .

1169
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:22,624
. . .and got as much deck activity
as possible to construct. . .

. . .showing how planes
take off and land.

1172
01:26:31,713 --> 01:26:36,707
JD: This is an area where John Moore
and I debated the music.

1173
01:26:36,953 --> 01:26:40,548
I thought this should be
very patriotic.

1174
01:26:41,393 --> 01:26:46,023
He didn't wanna hit it
as hard as I did.

1175
01:26:46,433 --> 01:26:50,187
So we compromised. There was a piece
he wanted me to give up on earlier.

1176
01:26:50,353 --> 01:26:54,665
He said, "I'll trade you that
for this. " I said, "Good idea. "

1177
01:27:06,673 --> 01:27:11,827
WG: For the aircraft carrier stuff,
we had a commander, Bob Anderson. . .

1178
01:27:12,073 --> 01:27:16,305
. . .who runs the Navy Hollywood office.
He coordinates. . .

1179
01:27:16,473 --> 01:27:19,545
. . .with film and television crews
and the Navy.

1180
01:27:19,713 --> 01:27:23,467
There are public relations guys
on the aircraft carrier. . .

1181
01:27:23,633 --> 01:27:28,388
. . .who've been told,
"Give these guys what they need. "

1182
01:27:28,593 --> 01:27:32,427
You've got a letter from
the Department of Defense saying:

1183
01:27:32,593 --> 01:27:35,107
"We're supporting this movie. "

1184
01:27:35,273 --> 01:27:41,382
A guy on the Carl Vinson named Charlie
Brown was there to help us maneuver.

1185
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:46,991
The night before you shoot,
you'd sit down with the commanders.

1186
01:27:47,153 --> 01:27:51,908
You would compare schedules
and negotiate every night. . .

1187
01:27:52,073 --> 01:27:54,792
. . .how and when you'd shoot
your scenes. . .

1188
01:27:54,953 --> 01:27:59,424
. . .when they'd let helicopters fly,
when they'd need to land the planes.

1189
01:27:59,593 --> 01:28:02,903
Every night you'd be up
until midnight negotiating.

1190
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:08,671
And you'd be up shooting the next
morning by 7:00 when it got light.

1191
01:28:09,473 --> 01:28:14,069
But I have to say,
as difficult as it was on the ship. . .

1192
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:19,301
. . .they did an extraordinary job
to help us get the shots we need.

1193
01:28:19,473 --> 01:28:24,831
I think they all have a sense of pride
about the way the movie ended up.

1194
01:28:25,553 --> 01:28:29,341
We premiered the movie down
in San Diego on the base. . .

1195
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:34,303
. . .and it was a once-in-a-lifetime
experience for them. They loved it.

1196
01:28:34,473 --> 01:28:40,548
JD: Top Gun was one of the biggest
recruiting booms for the U.S. Navy.

1197
01:28:40,753 --> 01:28:46,191
They were open to the idea that this
film could help them in a similar way.

1199

the movie on the Nimitz...

01:28:54,393 --> 01:28:58,068
. . .to the soldiers,
especially after September 1 1 .

1201
01:28:58,273 --> 01:29:03,506
Tom Rothman got up and stated,
"All we do is make movies.

And that's a fantastic commitment. "

1204
01:29:12,153 --> 01:29:18,023
Being able to show them this and
talk to them after was very emotional.

1205
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:27,227
WG: This scene you're watching now
is sort of a quicker version. . .

1206
01:29:27,553 --> 01:29:30,226
. . .of a much more involved fight. . .

1207
01:29:30,673 --> 01:29:33,107
. . .we had to trim for ratings issues.

1208
01:29:33,313 --> 01:29:36,669
There were more shots
Owen takes, bullet hits.

1209
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,222
The fight was a lot longer.

1210
01:29:39,473 --> 01:29:42,112
Owen, from here on out in the movie. . .

1211
01:29:42,353 --> 01:29:46,392
. . .is acting with a partially
separated shoulder.

1212
01:29:46,593 --> 01:29:52,065
He had had an accident on another
stunt, he'd injured his shoulder.

1213
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:58,547
He was back the next day doing action
sequences with a separated shoulder.

1214
01:29:58,753 --> 01:30:01,028
It's amazing that it's not obvious.

1215
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:05,744
If you look closely, at times you can
see he's favoring his right arm.

1216
01:30:05,913 --> 01:30:10,031
JD: Owen's from Texas.
Texas football, they're used to that.

1217
01:30:10,273 --> 01:30:13,948
WG: He grew up with two brothers,
he said, "This is nothing. "

1218
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:21,267
JD: Now this sequence was the subject
of a lot of editing and re-editing.

1219
01:30:22,393 --> 01:30:25,305
It was very hard
for us to get it right.

1220
01:30:25,513 --> 01:30:31,270
Initially John cut it as pure action,
and it wasn't emotionally satisfying.

1221
01:30:31,673 --> 01:30:36,952
And this piece, which was originally
in, but it was too obvious. . .

1222
01:30:37,193 --> 01:30:40,424
. . .we were able to do
a more subtle version of it.

1223
01:30:40,593 --> 01:30:43,903
This gave us an additional
emotional element. . .

1224
01:30:44,113 --> 01:30:49,267
. . .that transformed this from just
being action to being about something.

1225
01:30:49,473 --> 01:30:55,628
It's about Owen saying, "I have
to finish what this was all about.

in the movie. . .

and after. It made a difference.

jump and catch his arm.

1245
01:32:26,793 --> 01:32:29,944
We shot three different parts of it.

1246
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:32,946
It's a pretty phenomenal stunt. . .

1247
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:36,105
. . .when it all comes together.

1248
01:32:37,113 --> 01:32:39,263
JD:
Thank God he held on to him.

1249
01:32:39,433 --> 01:32:42,584
Actually, he's tied up,
so he's not gonna fall.

1250
01:32:42,753 --> 01:32:44,709
WG:
Through the sleeves.

1251
01:32:51,513 --> 01:32:56,382
JD: Now we're gonna get into
the multiple endings of the movie.

1252
01:32:57,313 --> 01:33:01,943
Because we have the movie
reaching an ending here.

1253
01:33:02,113 --> 01:33:05,469
And we'll have it reaching
an ending on the carrier.

1254
01:33:05,673 --> 01:33:09,188
We also had shot a full scene
with Gene Hackman. . .

1255
01:33:09,593 --> 01:33:11,185
. . .on the aircraft carrier--

1256
01:33:11,353 --> 01:33:13,913
WG: Getting the news that he lost
his battle group.

1257
01:33:14,153 --> 01:33:18,863
JD: And we had also shot the scene
where our villain. . .

1258
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:21,752
. . .gets taken down at an airport. . .

1259
01:33:21,913 --> 01:33:24,552
. . .dressed as a civilian,
trying to escape.

1260
01:33:24,873 --> 01:33:28,468
Special Forces bring him down.
And that was eliminated.

1261
01:33:28,673 --> 01:33:32,712
WG: And we had the scene
which sort of parallels the opening. . .

1262
01:33:32,953 --> 01:33:38,550
. . .where they were planting trees,
of the U.N. digging up the bodies.

1263
01:33:38,753 --> 01:33:42,985
On the DVD, you'll see we ended up
matching that. . .

1264
01:33:43,153 --> 01:33:47,590
. . .doing a split screen with Lokar's
arrest and the grave digging. . .

1265
01:33:47,753 --> 01:33:51,462
. . .which gave you closure
on what Owen--

1266
01:33:51,633 --> 01:33:54,431
At what Owen's journey
had brought about.

1267
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:56,663
JD:
Exactly.

1268
01:33:56,833 --> 01:34:01,065
WG: Unfortunately, the audience feels
like the movie's over here.

1269
01:34:01,473 --> 01:34:04,749
They're happy for him,
they're ready to go.

1270
01:34:04,953 --> 01:34:10,107
They weren't willing to sit through
another three minutes of scenes. . .

1271
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:14,107
. . .playing out the demise
of the other character.

1272
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:15,308
JD: Yeah.

1273
01:34:15,473 --> 01:34:20,672
This is a good time to thank everybody
for sitting through the audio portion.

1274
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:25,861
There's a lot of people we would like
to thank for helping us with the film.

1275
01:34:26,113 --> 01:34:30,231
WG: Obviously, Stephanie Austin,
the other executive producer.

1276
01:34:30,393 --> 01:34:34,306
She's in Prague shooting a movie,
so she couldn't be here.

1277
01:34:34,473 --> 01:34:40,230
She was a great help in getting what
the director needed to make the movie.

1278
01:34:41,433 --> 01:34:46,587
JD: The writers, the Thomas brothers,
who wrote the original film concept.

1279
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:50,746
And Zak Penn,
who wrote the final draft.

1280
01:34:50,913 --> 01:34:53,711
David Veloz,
who did an intermediate draft.

1281
01:34:53,873 --> 01:34:59,072
Each of the writers moved us further,
and all added important stuff.

1282
01:34:59,313 --> 01:35:03,101
WG: John Gatens, who helped
with the dialogue early on.

1283
01:35:03,353 --> 01:35:07,062
It was not credited but it helped
with Owen's character.

1284
01:35:07,273 --> 01:35:13,303
JD: And Emma Watts, who was our Fox
executive. This was her first movie.

1285
01:35:13,513 --> 01:35:18,348
She did a great job fighting
some of the studio battles for us.

1286
01:35:18,593 --> 01:35:24,509
Don Davis came in in a pinch
and helped us with the music.

1287
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:28,070
Brendan Galvin, who was the DP.

1288
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:32,988
And lastly, Tom Rothman
and Hutch Parker. . .

1289
01:35:33,153 --> 01:35:37,510
. . .president and chairman of Fox,
helped get this off the ground. . .

1290
01:35:37,673 --> 01:35:40,233
. . .were very helpful
whenever we needed money.

1291
01:35:40,393 --> 01:35:41,428
[MAN CHUCKLES]

1292
01:35:41,593 --> 01:35:45,632
And John Moore, who did a great job,
who's a great friend of ours.

1293
01:35:45,793 --> 01:35:49,581
And had a great first movie.
Thanks, John.

1294
01:35:49,753 --> 01:35:52,267
WG:
Thanks for sitting with us.

1295
01:36:00,073 --> 01:36:04,146
JD: What am I most proud and happy
with when all is said and done?

1296
01:36:04,393 --> 01:36:06,861
The fact that I like the movie.

1297
01:36:09,273 --> 01:36:12,185
WG: I'm just proud that it's
up there on screen.

1298
01:36:12,353 --> 01:36:16,869
It's a much bigger movie
than any of us expected it to be.

1299
01:36:26,233 --> 01:36:29,669
JD: Whenever a movie gets made,
you look back and go:

1300
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:33,826
"How many times was it impossible
that this was gonna happen?

1301
01:36:33,993 --> 01:36:38,703
How many times were we dead?
How many times did we come back?"

1302
01:36:38,913 --> 01:36:41,950
And at the end, when it's done,
you go:

1303
01:36:42,113 --> 01:36:46,345
"I don't know how we did it,
but thank God we did it. "

1304
01:36:46,513 --> 01:36:50,347
WG: It's amazing. You tend to forget
all the fights you have. . .

1305
01:36:50,593 --> 01:36:53,869
. . .and embrace the people
that helped you. . .

1306
01:36:54,073 --> 01:36:57,270
. . .no matter how many times
you fought with them.

1307
01:36:57,473 --> 01:37:01,068
JD: I lived with this project
for six years.

1308
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:04,430
And it was dead three times.

1309
01:37:06,033 --> 01:37:09,469
I almost gave up on it until
a Navy pilot said:

1310
01:37:09,633 --> 01:37:15,071
"You can't give up on it,
you just gotta keep at it. "
