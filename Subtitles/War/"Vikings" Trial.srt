You killed him?

188
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,180
Lagertha: He raped a Saxon woman.

189
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:32,482
Then he tried to rape me.

190
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,486
Did anyone else see it happen?

191
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,290
That's a pity.

192
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,825
And where were you?

193
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:50,767
(Loot clatters and clanks, water splashes)

194
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,872
(Waves crash ashore, seagulls cry)

195
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,776
(Man shouts a command,
Saxon soldiers cry out)

196
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,315
(Dragging sound)

197
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,655
Hold!

198
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,861
What is it?

199
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,763
Who is there?!

200
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,438
Saxon prisoner: (Sighs with relief)

201
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:32,809
(Loot clatters and clanks)

202
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,615
(Waves crash ashore)

203
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,553
(Readying inhale)

204
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,123
Saxon: Archers front!

205
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,391
Shield wall!

206
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,293
(Shields thump into place)

207
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,529
Saxon commander: (Yelling
indistinct commands)

208
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,631
(Arrows whoosh)

209
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,135
(Arrows puncture and
clatter off shield wall)

210
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,804
(Gasps)

211
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,472
(Yelling command)

212
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,775
Saxon soldiers: (Screaming war cries)

213
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,579
Stand!

214
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,885
(Soldiers crash into shield wall)

215
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,421
(Men shouting, roaring, and screaming)

216
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,592
(Weapons ring out, clashing)

217
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,428
(Men shouting, roaring, and screaming)

218
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,297
Ragnar: Open!

219
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,232
(Arrow whistles)

220
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:33,570
(Soldiers shout and scream,
weapons hacking away)

221
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,838
Rollo: (Shouting a viking song)
Up onto the overturned keel,

222
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:39,209
clamber, with a heart of steel,

223
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,245
cold is the ocean's spray...

224
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,345
(Arrows whoosh)

225
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,249
And your death is on its way,

226
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,250
with maidens you have had your way,

227
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,555
viking warriors: Each must die some day!

228
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,491
(Vikings grunt with renewed effort)

229
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,798
(Weapons clanging and clanking)

230
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,302
(Shouting and screaming fills the air)

231
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,672
(Weapons clashing and hacking)

232
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,875
(Hard blow, Saxon screams)

233
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,779
(Weapons clash and hack,
men scream and yell)

234
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:20,784
(Hard blow, Saxon screams)

235
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,589
Ungh!

236
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,258
Agghhhh!

237
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,762
Agghhhh!

238
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,233
Argh!

239
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,434
Lagertha: Ragnar! Ragnar: Close the wall!

240
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,303
Lagertha: Shield wall!

241
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,207
Ungh!

242
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,408
Aghhhhhh!

243
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,777
(Weapons clash and clank)

244
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,415
(Repeated hard blows)

245
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:54,851
(In norse)

246
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:58,455
(Men shout and grunt, weapons clash)

247
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:03,826
(Vikings roar, advancing)

248
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,529
Wigea: Yah! Yah!

249
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,765
(Saxon men scream)

250
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:16,138
(Horses whinny and gallop away)

251
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:23,008
(Sudden stillness, seabirds
cry in the distance)

252
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:31,286
(Waves wash ashore)

253
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:36,892
King Aelle: How could this
happen, my lord Wigea?

254
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,893
Wigea: Sire, I have never
in my life seen men fight

255
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,729
as these northmen fight.

256
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:43,230
Believe me, there's something
devilish in the way they look,

257
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:45,901
in their lack of fear in the face of death.

258
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:49,337
King Aelle: My lord, that is
just a counsel of despair.

259
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:52,307
Are these pagans not men, like we are?

260
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,643
Do they not bleed when they are cut?

261
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,945
Or do they have wings and tongues of fire?

262
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,180
No, sire.

263
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:04,753
Who are they?

264
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:07,021
We captured two of them, who
were guarding their boat.

265
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,989
We couldn't understand
anything they said at all,

266
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:10,892
except one word:

267
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:13,828
Ragnar.

268
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,164
Ragnar.

269
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:25,907
(Wind gusts, fire crackles)

270
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:35,217
(Vikings murmur quietly)

271
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:38,887
Rollo: Death is on its way to take Kauko.

272
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,159
Don't grieve for him. Don't pity him.

273
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:46,661
Guess where he is now?

274
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:50,699
The valkyries are taking
him home to Valhalla.

275
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,869
Right at this moment he is...

276
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:58,073
He is drinking ale with the gods.

277
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,076
Yes,

278
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:06,414
he is happier than even we are,

279
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,649
with our boat and... these goods.

280
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:14,256
Erik: Even so, he was my kinsman.

281
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:18,760
We must avenge his death.

282
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,396
It was done in the name of king Aelle,

283
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,932
and king Aelle must suffer for it.

284
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,636
One day, he will...

285
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:32,307
If the gods will it.

286
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,045
(Saxon prisoner whimpers)

287
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:41,283
Look at him,

288
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:43,852
he's wetting himself.

289
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:48,056
You kept your word.

290
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:53,895
You took us to the town,
and I thank you for that.

291
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,368
Drink.

292
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,681
You want to live?

293
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:18,653
(Saxon prisoner gulps)

294
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,655
(Prisoner grunts)

295
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,658
(Hard whack) Ungh!

296
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:28,063
Bjorn: I want to go to Kattegat.

297
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,265
I want to see my father return soon.

298
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,002
He must return soon.

299
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:35,269
I gave your father my word

300
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:38,039
that I would look after you both here.

301
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,908
You are not looking after us.

302
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,110
We look after ourselves.

303
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,314
I cannot allow you to go
on your own to Kattegat.

304
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,349
Your father would never
tolerate such a thing.

305
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,987
Bjorn: Then we should go together,

306
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,956
the three of us.

307
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:59,094
Athelstan: And who will
then look after the farm?

308
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,896
For what we are about to receive,

309
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,630
may the lord make us truly grateful.

310
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,100
Amen.

311
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,804
(Ale splashes into cup)

312
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,248
Gyda: Can I have some ale?

313
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:23,385
You're too young, Gyda, to drink ale.

314
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,931
I want to make a sacrifice to Thor,

315
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:39,901
for my father's safe return.

316
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,703
What will you sacrifice?

317
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:43,204
You!

318
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,008
(Cup and bowl crash on the floor)

319
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:54,749
(Rough, scratchy rasp)

320
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:09,664
Athelstan: (Very quietly)
Where are you, lord?

321
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:11,332
Tell me:

322
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:15,637
Is it your will that I am
here with these heathens?

323
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,338
(Wind howls outside)

324
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:22,277
How does it serve you?

325
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,915
I don't understand.

326
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:32,854
And for the first time in my life

327
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,991
I am angry with you.

328
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:42,630
You allow my brothers to
be slaughtered and sold.

329
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:46,367
Is this really your will?

330
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:54,309
For the first time...

331
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,278
I feel lonely.

332
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:04,085
Where are you, lord?

333
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:09,023
Where are you?

334
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:11,359
And why don't you answer me?

335
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:16,928
(Strange rustling and shaking of feathers)

336
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:38,386
It's just an owl.

337
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,001
Bjorn.

338
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:55,103
Bjorn, wake up.

339
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:01,276
(Exasperated groan) What is it?

340
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:05,310
We'll go to Kattegat
all of us, tomorrow.

341
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,258
(Seabird cries)

342
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:17,760
Warrior: Kattegat!

343
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:24,099
(Excited shouting in the distance)

344
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:26,902
Women and children: (Chatter excitedly)

345
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,741
(Crowd buzzes with excitement)

346
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,082
(Crowd shouts and murmurs excitedly)

347
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,293
(Crowd hushes)

348
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:59,101
Earl Haraldson: Ragnar Lothbrok, my friend,

349
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,704
how was your voyage?

350
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:04,139
Successful I hope,

351
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,675
for all our sakes.

352
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,744
(Loot clatters and clanks)

353
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:13,946
Ragnar: The saxons attacked us
when we returned to the boat,

354
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,685
in great force,

355
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:19,954
(shouts) But we defeated them!

356
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,924
(Crowd erupts in cheers)

357
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:26,028
You are the man that people say you are...

358
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,263
A great adventurer...

359
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,234
And I am happy to salute your achievements

360
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,371
and to share in the profit of your raid.

361
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:41,777
But I don't see my friend, Knut,

362
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:44,113
where... where is he?

363
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:49,852
Knut is dead.

364
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:51,286
Dead?

365
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:54,823
Did he die in the battle?

366
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:56,258
No.

367
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:00,796
Then how did he die?

368
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,970
I killed him.

369
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:09,672
You killed him.

370
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,043
For what reason?

371
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:22,217
Because he tried to rape my wife, Lagertha.

372
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,222
I find it too convenient

373
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,692
that you would make an excuse

374
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,193
to kill my friend

375
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:33,662
and my agent on your voyage.

376
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:38,032
What did you think that you would gain

377
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,102
by getting rid of him?

378
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,704
I didn't expect to gain anything.

379
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:45,240
Earl Haraldson: I don't believe you.

380
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:49,078
Arrest him!

381
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,380
Ragnar: My lord!

382
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:53,148
For your wife Siggy

383
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,951
would have you not done the same?

384
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:58,821
(Floki growls)

385
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:02,391
Svein: I would counsel you
all against such actions.

386
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:05,661
There is no way you could prevail.

387
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,664
Ragnar: Floki.

388
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:15,237
Svein: Bring him away.

389
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:19,374
Lagertha: Ragnar! Ragnar!

390
00:26:24,948 --> 00:26:27,950
(Footsteps approach)

391
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,725
You summoned me, lord?

392
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,662
Yes, I want to talk to you.

393
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,866
Please, sit. Drink.

394
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:55,677
It's, um...

395
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:00,349
It's a delicate matter.

396
00:27:01,284 --> 00:27:03,051
You...

397
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:04,886
You are the brother of Ragnar Lothbrok,

398
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,820
are you not?

399
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,823
I am.

400
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:10,359
A spirited man, your brother.

401
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:13,362
Is he a fair man?

402
00:27:15,698 --> 00:27:18,934
Does he treat you equally
when you sail with him?

403
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,707
Up to a point.

404
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:29,812
Forgive me, but I think
that he likes to rule you.

405
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:31,145
And that whatever he says,

406
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,849
in actual fact, he considers himself

407
00:27:33,884 --> 00:27:36,685
to be first among equals.

408
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:39,755
Am I correct?

409
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,256
(Silence)

410
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,259
I get the impression that he wants to...

411
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,361
To take the credit for everything...

412
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:49,965
For building the boat, for sailing west.

413
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,934
He wants to be the hero.

414
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:57,272
Is that what it comes down to?

415
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,674
To him?

416
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:03,879
Would he have achieved what he has achieved

417
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:05,681
if it wasn't for you?

418
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,284
(Silence)

419
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:13,355
What do you say, Rollo?

420
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,364
Of course not.

421
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,669
It would have been impossible.

422
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:31,673
As long as I am Earl,

423
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,710
Ragnar Lothbrok can give you nothing.

424
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:38,814
I, on the other hand, can
give you a great deal.

425
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,817
I could, for example,
confiscate the treasure

426
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:44,353
that you brought back from england...

427
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:47,623
And offer you a goodly portion of it.

428
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,761
Would you do that, lord?

429
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:54,863
I might.

430
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,098
Depends.

431
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:57,799
On what would it depend?

432
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,836
Your ambition.

433
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:02,271
You want to stand out.

434
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:04,106
You want to be someone, Rollo.

435
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,942
You want the gods to notice you, yes?

436
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:09,143
They would have noticed me already.

437
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,781
Earl Haraldson: Oh no, my friend.
And do you know why?

438
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:16,318
Because you still walk in the
shadow of Ragnar Lothbrok.

439
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:18,987
Don't you think it's time
you stepped out from it

440
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,022
and let the gods see you
for who you really are?

441
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:31,199
Oh! I want you to say hello to somebody.

442
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,042
This is my daughter, Thyri.

443
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:43,078
She is soon to get married

444
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:47,282
and I must think very carefully
about her future husband.

445
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:50,953
He must be a man of ambition and prospect,

446
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:52,688
as you can understand.

447
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:58,694
I used to have two boys
but they were killed.

448
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:02,664
So the man that I choose
to be my son-in-law

449
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:07,703
will hold a high and special place,

450
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:11,239
as if he were my own son.

451
00:30:13,242 --> 00:30:16,178
Thyri, say hello to Rollo.

452
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,980
Hello.

453
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,681
Hello.

454
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,718
Siggy: Don't forget about me, my love.

455
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,052
Earl Haraldson: Oh, yes.

456
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,955
And this is Siggy, my wife.

457
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:28,657
This is Rollo.

458
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:32,661
He is the brother of Ragnar Lothbrok.

459
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,264
Hello, Rollo.

460
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:38,833
I have heard a lot about you.

461
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:43,105
They say that you are a great warrior.

462
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:54,182
With chatter)

463
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,624
(Door opens)

464
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:08,697
(Everyone quiets down)

465
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:15,203
Svein: Bring in the prisoner.

466
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,639
(Crowd jeers loudly)

467
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:21,143
Woman: That murderer!

468
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:24,279
(Jeering)

469
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:26,982
Bjorn: Look at him!

470
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,817
He's in chains.

471
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,387
It's all right, boy.

472
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:36,622
We are all aware of the sacred
nature of our duty here.

473
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:40,996
You stand before us accused
of the willful murder

474
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,265
of Knut, my brother.

475
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,135
Knut, as some of you may know,

476
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:50,405
was the bastard son of my father.

477
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:55,343
But I loved him...

478
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,145
Like a brother.

479
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:00,282
I asked Knut to...

480
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,384
To go with Ragnar Lothbrok to england,

481
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:06,418
where they raided a town and
brought back many spoils.

482
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,357
And while they were raiding this town,

483
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:13,261
Ragnar Lothbrok took it upon himself

484
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:16,098
to cold-bloodedly kill my brother.

485
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:19,268
It's easy to imagine

486
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:22,737
why a man like this would do such a thing.

487
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,642
This is an ambitious man.

488
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:31,179
He doesn't care to share his spoils,

489
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,848
and he resents the fact

490
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:35,217
that he owes me loyalty and obedience,

491
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:38,820
as his chieftain.

492
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:44,626
This is a man who does not
believe in our traditions.

493
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:49,998
This is a man who does
not believe in our laws.

494
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:53,168
Crowd: (Sounds of disapproval and disgust)

495
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:55,137
Svein: Silence! Silence!

496
00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:58,840
Earl Haraldson: What do you have to say,

497
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:00,207
when you stand before us,

498
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,378
and know that you must tell the truth?

499
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:08,316
It is that true that I killed Knut,

500
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,952
sadly, your brother.

501
00:33:13,256 --> 00:33:15,390
But I killed him

502
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,827
when I found him trying to rape my wife.

503
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:23,231
I ask all of you freemen,

504
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:31,403
what would have you done
if you were in my place?

505
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,644
Would have you just stood back,

506
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,315
encouraged the culprit?

507
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:49,257
I don't think you would.

508
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,195
And even if I had of known at the time

509
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,230
he was your brother,

510
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:59,034
I would have carried out the same sentence.

511
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:03,068
Svein: Do you seriously ask
us to believe your story?

512
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,407
I can confirm the story.

513
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,842
(Crowd murmurs)

514
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:11,079
You are the wife of Ragnar Lothbrok?

515
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:12,747
I am, lord.

516
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,184
How extraordinary that
you happened to be there

517
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,886
at the same time.

518
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,053
(Crowd titters)

519
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:21,990
Your husband is lying

520
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:23,858
and you are so under his thumb

521
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:26,261
that he has persuaded you to lie for him.

522
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,730
May Thor strike you dead!

523
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:33,835
(Shouts of outrage and disapproval)

524
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,007
Earl Haraldson: What did you say?

525
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:41,142
My husband did not kill Knut Tjodolf.

526
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:42,144
Svein: Then who did?

527
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:44,879
Lagertha: I did! I killed him.

528
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:45,946
I stabbed him in the heart

529
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,950
when he tried his best to rape me.

530
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:51,252
Svein: A murder is committed

531
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:55,390
and the only witnesses are
a husband and his wife.

532
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:57,392
(Crowd chuckles)

533
00:34:57,393 --> 00:34:59,860
Unfortunately, we can't tell
who committed the crime

534
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:03,365
because they both claim credit for it.

535
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:06,868
You didn't kill my brother.

536
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:09,237
Look at you, how could you?

537
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,273
He killed my brother.

538
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,842
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.

539
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:17,012
We have proof.

540
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,348
We have a witness to the killing.

541
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:24,386
(Whispers of surprise
run through the crowd)

542
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:37,399
Svein: You say you are a witness
to the death of Knut Tjodolf?

543
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,733
Yes.

544
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,269
Svein: You'll swear this
upon your arm ring?

545
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,371
Yes, I was there.

546
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:47,742
I saw everything.

547
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,845
Earl Haraldson: So, who killed my brother?

548
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,182
(Fire snaps and crackles)

549
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:58,086
Ragnar Lothbrok killed him.

550
00:35:58,121 --> 00:36:00,188
(Crowd murmurs)

551
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,324
In cold blood?

552
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,358
No, lord. For a good reason.

553
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:12,233
What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.

554
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:16,871
Your half-brother was caught
raping a Saxon woman.

555
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:19,240
Then he attempted to rape
Ragnar's lawful wife,

556
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,743
Lagertha, the shield-maiden.

557
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:25,246
So unfortunately...

558
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:29,250
You cannot punish him.

559
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:35,253
(Chains jingle) Now who has the key?

560
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:39,874
(Crowd buzzes with chatter)

561
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:44,747
(Lively music plays)

562
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:48,317
(Warriors chatter and laugh)

563
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,121
Woman: Come, Bjorn. Man:
Like father like son.

564
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:55,324
(Laughing)

565
00:36:56,626 --> 00:37:00,112
It seems I owe you an eternal debt.

566
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:01,780
I know.

567
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:06,185
And I look forward to collecting it.

568
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:10,689
Leif: Let's drink a toast to Ragnar!

569
00:37:10,725 --> 00:37:13,225
To his future and his freedom!

570
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,994
No, no, no, no.

571
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,298
To friends and freedom!

572
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,101
All: To friends and freedom!

573
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:26,102
Arne: (Drunkenly) Not that
he'll ever be free of us!

574
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:29,341
(Laughing)

575
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:38,283
Ragnar: Will you drink with me?

576
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:39,918
Of course.

577
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:47,793
Thank you for taking care of my children.

578
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,230
You're a good Christian.

579
00:37:51,265 --> 00:37:52,731
(Laughs)

580
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:55,200
(Cup and blow clatter and clank)

581
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:59,138
I wanted to say thank you.

582
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:01,173
You did a fine good thing, Rollo.

583
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,342
I hope the gods were watching.

584
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,077
I didn't do it for him.

585
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:11,150
I did it for you, shield-maiden.

586
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:14,920
I don't want to believe that.

587
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:19,124
Floki: Ragnar!

588
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,261
Did you see Haraldson's face
when he had to acquit you

589
00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:24,263
and then give you half his hoard?

590
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:26,365
He looked like this!

591
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,101
(Ragnar and others laugh)

592
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:34,807
(Laughing hysterically)

593
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:40,112
(Erik groans while he takes a leak)

594
00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:41,313
(Sighs)

595
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,383
Ungh! (Grunting)

596
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:46,618
(Struggling grunts)

597
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:49,721
(Hard stab, gurgled grunt)

598
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:53,926
(Laughter and merriment halts)

599
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:59,198
Man: Ragnar Lothbrok?

600
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:00,064
I am unarmed.

601
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,099
(Swords ring as they're unsheathed)

602
00:39:06,273 --> 00:39:08,340
Get the children.

603
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,942
(Attack cry)

604
00:39:09,977 --> 00:39:12,277

(Women cry out)

609
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,355
(Men shout and grunt, stabbing and hacking)

610
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:31,330
(Incessant dripping)

611
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:45,744
Ellisef: (Weeping softly)

612
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:49,781
Leif: Father.

613
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:58,824
(Seabird cries)

614
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:03,028
(Wind gusts, seabird shrieks)

615
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:09,735
(Chickens cluck, pigs snort)

616
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:12,838
Ragnar: Ungh!

617
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:16,375
(Sheep bleat)

618
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,943
Ungh! (Forceful chop)

619
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,918
Ungh! (Forceful chop)

620
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:28,120
(Axe clatters)

621
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,766
(Logs thump loudly)

622
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:43,937
(Water sloshes)

623
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:48,707
(Geese honk noisily)

624

Seer: Stones and bones.

625
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:16,969
Stones and bones.

626
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:19,637
Earl Haraldson: What do you read?

627
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:22,608
Seer: Wait. Not so impatient, lord.

628
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:24,343
Earl Haraldson: Tell me.

629
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:26,244
Seer: Ask me a question

630
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,749
are the signs... threatening?

631
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,252
Seer: Yes.

632
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:37,089
There is a quarrel.

633
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,858
There will be violence...

634
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:43,892
Bones and skulls broken. I see that.

635
00:41:46,232 --> 00:41:48,934

sitting on the hillside?

Seer: He searches for your death;

638
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:08,754
consults the gods to
whom he claims kinship.

639
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,659
Who could believe such a thing?

640
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:18,830
Does he desire to be Earl?

641
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:23,669
If he kills you, will it not be so?

642
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,141
Do the gods speak?

643
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:32,144
Seer: Do they ever stop?

644
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:37,649
Gods have always been favorable to me.

645
00:42:39,152 --> 00:42:43,088
They allowed yours sons to die...

646
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:54,128
Earl Haraldson: Do the gods really exist?

647
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:03,275
(The seer laughs)

648
00:43:21,961 --> 00:43:24,996
I know what he's doing.

649
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:26,965
He's preparing himself.
