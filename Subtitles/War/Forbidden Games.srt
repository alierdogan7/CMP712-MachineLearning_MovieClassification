JUNE 1 940

3
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:03,765
Clear the way.

4
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,285
The swine!

5
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,125
- It's ruined!
- I told you not to stop the motor.

6
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,962
My little Jock...

7
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:01,881
- We can't go on with three bags.
- We'll stop a car.

8
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,395
Paulette!

9
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,156
Jock... Jock.

10
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:50,637
Paulette!

11
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,997
What are you doing?
Do you want to get killed?

12
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:05,955
Go on, get in.

13
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,724
As if I'm not burdened enough...

14
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,366
Throw it away.

15
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,880
Don't you see he's dead?

16
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:20,446
He's dead?

17
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,081
Break my cart
and I'll burn your truck!

18
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,920
If you want a fight,
the war's somewhere else!

19
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,839
Hold your breath and blow up!

20
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,799
What's this horse doing here?

21
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,684
Yes, why's that horse there?

22
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:29,765
Careful, Georges.
It's a warhorse, don't touch it.

23
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:57,841
- Was he shot?
- No, it's this goddam horse.

24
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,998
I said not to touch it.

25
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:04,800
Easy, you're hurting me.

26
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,085
Titine's gone!

27
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,561
You couldn't stop her?

28
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:17,562
- Are you afraid?
- I'm not afraid. Cows aren't scary.

29
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,082
I couldn't, I have my dog.

30
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:23,881
- What's with your dog?
- He's dead.

31
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,556
- Where are you from?
- From over there.

32
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,645
You're not from here.

33
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,440
No, and you?

34
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,281
Me, yes... Where's your mother?

35
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,960
She's dead.

36
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,398
- And your father?
- He's dead.

37
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,320
My father's not dead.

38
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:45,400
He'll whip me
if I don't bring back the cow.

39
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,203
Help me bring it back.

40
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,436
But my dog?

41
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,962
Leave your dog... I'll give you another.

42
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,236
- A good one?
- Not bad.

43
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:02,397
Where is it?

44
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,001
At home.

45
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,884
You'll give me that dog?

46
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,958
No, that's the neighbour's.

47
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,076
- Can he swim?
- I don't know. We don't speak.

48
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,446
What's his name?

49
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,559
Gouard. That's their name.

50
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:40,199
- What's your surname?
- Dollé.

51
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,164
- And you?
- Michel. What's yours?

52
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,316
Paulette.

53
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,476
You're from Paris?

54
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:47,366
- Yes... and you?
- Me, no.

55
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:06,883
WII your father let me
keep the dog?

56
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,315
I don't know.

57
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:21,316
What're you doing here, stupid dog?

58
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,798
I'll teach you to be a watchdog.

59
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,559
What did my dog do to you?

60
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,647
Always barking
and we've got someone wounded.

61
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,839
You care for the wounded
so they'll die sooner.

62
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,123
It's all right for you to kill people.

63
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,763
Who pulled your grandmother
out of the water?

64
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,356
She'd drowned when you pulled her out.

65
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,200
No, I got a medal for life saving.

66
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,686
I didn't ask you.

67
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:49,516
Anyway, I'm sick of hearing
about your life-saving medal.

68
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,520
Now what's this?

69
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:02,283
Her father and mother were killed.

70
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,085
What should I do about it?

71
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:09,445
We could keep her!

72
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:12,919
You and your wounded brother!

73
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,841
All right, she'll go to the Gouards.

74
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:19,483
The Gouards?
They'll want another medal.

75
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,239
Come and tell us all about it.

76
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,479
That goddam horse!

77
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,279
Pick my money up.

78
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,600
Who's there?

79
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,837
I came to say...

80
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,206
She's from the road.

81
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,800
I found her.

82
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,440
Who is it?

83
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:14,686
- She's all dressed up.
- I want material like that for my dress.

84
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:18,085
Her parents were killed...

85
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,045
She'll tell us about it.

86
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,845
I'll give it to her.

87
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,559
Really? You'll tell us about the war?

88
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,718
- You saw the bombs?
- Where are you from?

89
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,196
- What's your name?
- How old are you?

90
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,557
So you've nothing to say?

91
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,160
Are you thirsty?

92
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,320
It's dirty.

93
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:46,520
Look at your glass.
There's a fly.

94
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,201
Go on, drink.

95
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,875
Not thirsty?

96
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,560
She doesn't want it.

97
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:58,359
You'll scare her
crowding her like that.

98
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:01,162
It's better to act uninterested.

99
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,601
Michel, I'm tired.

100
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:17,199
"The military situation
worsened on all fronts

101
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,643
"throughout yesterday.

102
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,361
"The ministers met all day."

103
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:24,916
You see!

104
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,440
"Our troops' resistance
is strong and effective."

105
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,361
Do your maths.

106
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,727
"A slice of veal weighing
2 1 /2 kilogrammes costs 1 42 franos."

107
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,919
"An alert in Malta."

108
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:59,525
"How much would it cost to buy a slice
weighing 1 50 grammes?"

109
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,319
- Well!
- Don't wake her.

110
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,637
- The Gouard's son.
- What!

111
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:08,275
Why would he be in the paper?

112
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,924
- Why not! They decorated him.
- Decorated Francis, that really hurts.

113
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:15,362
At least he's doing his bit.

114
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,757
That's enough... what is it?

115
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,246
A blanket for the kid.

116
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,995
Take Raymond's.

117
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,516
I haven't any spare.

118
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,161
Take mine.

119
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:28,601
It's the same bed.

120
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,519
I can give it to her.

121
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,160
Poor kid!

122
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,405
At that age they don't understand!

123
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:41,360
Seventeen dead on the bridge.

124
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,598
They can't even bury them properly.

125
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,203
If you die now
you don't even get a box!

126
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:48,921
What do they do?

127
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,721
Dig a hole, like dogs.

128
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:54,961
Don't say that.

129
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:56,482
She's asleep.

130
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:25,120
Did you see it:
"A German side-car was captured"...

131
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:32,246
You all right?

132
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,524
Yes... Oh, I don't know.

133
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,320
She's so clean!

134
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,919
Smells like perfume.

135
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,998
She's so clean
she'll never get used to it here.

136
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,919
Why not?

137
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,443
You want to keep her, don't you?

138
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,920
All right, go on down.

139
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,840
I'm afraid of the dark.

140
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:05,316
Call out "Michel" and I'll come.

141
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,116
Louder.

142
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,162
Yes, like that.

143
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:16,077
- What's she want?
- I don't know.

144
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:17,761
Shut her up.

145
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:21,117
- And my maths?
- Do what you're told.

146
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,517
I won't do my maths.

147
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:27,885
I can't see anything.

148
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,315
Close your eyes and count to ten.

149
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:36,676
How many fingers?

150
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,963
I said I can't see.

151
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:41,766
- Can't you count?
- Three.

152
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,519
You see, you can see.

153
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:47,080
- Why stick out your tongue?
- To see if you can see.

154
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,281
A rocket! Come see.

155
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,283
I'm afraid.
I'll sleep on the floor.

156
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,116
You're afraid of the dark
and the light!

157
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,445
- Is it still bright?
- No!

158
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:00,562
Liar!

159
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,360
It's over.

160
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,802
I don't want to stay here.

161
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:14,321
You have to... Where'll you go?

162
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,682
I want to go to mama and papa
on the bridge.

163
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,965
They're not there any more.

164
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:25,846
Why? Where are they?

165
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,682
In a hole.

166
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,400
In a hole?

167
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:34,357
Like dogs?

168
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:51,278
Are they in a hole because of the rain?
To stay dry?

169
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,359
It must be for that.

170
00:21:56,967 --> 00:22:01,119
But my dog... won't he be wet?

171
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,005
Can you sleep?

172
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,279
You're not afraid?

173
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,720
Can I go?

174
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,356
Michel...

175
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,477
- What is it?
- Don't you hear her?

176
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,678
- What?
- I don't want her to cry out.

177
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:08,326
Don't get mad like that.

178
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,845
Why are you yelling?

179
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,195
Afraid?

180
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,000
Don't yell then.

181
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,680
I didn't.

182
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,481
See, I told her. She's asleep.

183
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:06,525
She is, but I'm not.

184
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:09,362
If you wish, I won't either.

185
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,923
Want me to read you the paper?

186
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,680
The war?

187
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:19,645
No, not the war, the serial.

188
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:25,562
"It was still too soon
to give the signal to leave.

189
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:30,039
"Nonetheless, some who were travelling
on horseback'...

190
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,640
Don't talk about horses...

191
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:33,685
All right, I'll skip some:

192
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,202
"Thus, all the precautions

193
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:40,280
"had been taken around

194
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,638
"the hacienda..."

195
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,041
Paulette!

196
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,722
- You're not up yet?
- I'm dressing.

197
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:03,161
Hurry up!

198
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:06,086
Quiet, you can see he's ill!

199
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,522
What's wrong with him?

200
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,325
A horse kicked him.

201
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:20,523
What is that?

202
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:22,321
The good Lord.

203
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:24,640
You've never seen him?

204
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:27,122
Yes, but I never knew who he was.

205
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:28,960
Come drink your milk.

206
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:33,917
Good morning.

207
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:36,320
She didn't know the Lord.

208
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm thirsty.

209
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:42,719
We should find out where she's from.
Where are you from?

210
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,082
She's from Paris.

211
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:46,323
- Poor child.
- She should be baptized.

212
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:49,877
We must tell the mayor
or they'll say we stole her...

213
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:52,436
We should go to the police.

214
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:55,599
In any case, we must report her.

215
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,126
I'll go to the police.

216
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:58,885
You take care of your cows.

217
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,116
Are you coming with me?

218
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,079
Wait, I'm not done.

219
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:23,921
Look at what they're leaving
by the wayside.

220
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:32,320
Don't make me laugh, it hurts.

221
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:34,318
Here, you'll see it better.

222
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,560
Oh, it hurts.

223
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:39,842
And the doctor?

224
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:43,682
He's at the hospital
because of the bombings.

225
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:48,238
I don't need a doctor,
I need an undertaker.

226
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,524
You can use the old hearse
if we fix it up.

227
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:37,243
You're not from around here.

228
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:41,046
Cat got your tongue?
Where do you live?

229
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,885
At Mr. Dollé's.
Papa and mama are dead.

230
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:48,881
Poor child. Did you at least say
a prayer for them?

231
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:51,405
Don't you want to?

232
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:53,480
I don't know how.

233
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:56,957
I'll teach you.
Put your hands like this.

234
00:27:59,007 --> 00:27:59,883
Now repeat.

235
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:02,681
"May God receive them into paradise."

236
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,236
"May God receive them into paradise."

237
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:09,559
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

238
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:15,963
Do as I do.

239
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:22,844
Don't you want to?
Michel will teach you.

240
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,716
He knows his catechism well.

241
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:33,361
What are you doing?

242
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:34,960
None of your business.

243
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:36,765
I looked all over for you.

244
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:39,086
You're digging a hole?

245
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:42,324
Oh, it's for your dog.

246
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:45,760
Give... it's too hard.

247
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:55,000
We'll make a little cemetery.

248
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,919
What's a cemetery?

249
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,362
It's where they put the dead
to be together.

250
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,597
Why do they put them together?

251
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,405
So they're not sad.

252
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,164
But my dog will be all alone.

253
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,360
I'll find him another one.

254
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,445
Another dog? That's hard.

255
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:18,763
What's that?

256
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,639
- That's the Mayor.
- Why?

257
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,001
That his name, he's an owl.

258
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:23,602
Is he mean?

259
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,678
No, he's always asleep.

260
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:29,681
You'll see...

261
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:32,286
Don't kill him.

262
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:35,359
It's not worth it,
it's a hundred years old.

263
00:30:36,487 --> 00:30:37,681
A hundred years...

264
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:53,802
May God receive him into paradise.

265
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:56,686
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

266
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:14,278
Don't move.

267
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,639
I'll give you another.

268
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,159
I have a mole.

269
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:32,921
We'll need more.

270
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:34,566
There are plenty...

271
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,080
Cats.

272
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,078
Hedgehogs... lizards...

273
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,606
Horses... cows...

274
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:40,876
Rattlesnakes...

275
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,361
- Lions...
- Tigers...

276
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,046
People...

277
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:52,197
If you want...
and after, we'll put up crosses.

278
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,565
Why crosses?

279
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:01,281
What did your parents teach you?

280
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:05,676
You'll see...

281
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,716
See, it's not hard.

282
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:14,640
That's a cross.

283
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:16,326
That's the good Lord...

284
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:18,079
Yes...

285
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:19,636
Wait...

286
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:26,487
- Your necklace is pretty.
- It's broken.

287
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,395
That's better.

288
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:32,206
But there's a prettier one
over your brother's bed.

289
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,005
You think it's pretty?

290
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:37,484
I'll make better ones with a hammer.

291
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:39,558
And they'll be all over.

292
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:47,759
Look at this.

293
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,676
Darn... I have to start over.
You don't know how.

294
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:57,443
Hail Mary, full of grace...

295
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:58,960
The Lord is with thee.

296
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,517
Blessed art thou among women,

297
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:06,566
and blessed is Jesus
the fruit of thy...

298
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,080
...of thy womb...

299
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:10,716
Prayers.

300
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,839
The priest has good prayers.

301
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,679
You know your prayers?

302
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:20,122
What did we say to Gran?

303
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,795
- "Our Father who art in heaven."
- To Gran?

304
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,645
You'd say: "Hail Mary".

305
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,603
I don't want to be called "Mary".

306
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,800
What are they doing up there?

307
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:36,566
The priest said to be calm.

308
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,038
Michel, what is a womb?

309
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:43,478
Where Georges is hurt. Go on.

310
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:48,075
...and hurt is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

311
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:50,081
...blessed.

312
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:55,923
After that?

313
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:57,840
It's done. Say "Amen".

314
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:02,006
Amen. Why do they all end the same?

315
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,118
That means they're done.
Start over.

316
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:06,086
Amen.

317
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:07,436
Start again.

318
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:10,883
Our Father who art in heaven,

319
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:14,960
hallowed be thy name...

320
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,518
Thy kingdom come.

321
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:20,838
Take that.

322
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:24,204
I'll teach you with a hammer.
We should keep quiet!

323
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:27,240
I'm teaching her the prayers.

324
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:29,157
I don't know them.

325
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:31,523
That's prayers?

326
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,520
Putting a cross in a sick house!
You want him to die?

327
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:36,883
I don't want to see you together.

328
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:44,238
Stay then. You'll go to bed
without dinner.

329
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,325
What's wrong, Georges?

330
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:53,081
Answer your mother.

331
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:54,600
What's wrong?

332
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,805
He's spitting blood.

333
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,927
I can't understand him,
he's spitting again.

334
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:06,401
What's wrong with you?

335
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,046
You won't eat!

336
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,600
Answer.

337
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,556
First time I've seen someone spit blood.

338
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,560
- The sheets need washing.
- Give him a handkerchief.

339
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,847
- Is that better?
- Pat him on the back.

340
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:23,282
- Some tea.
- It's his heart.

341
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:26,917
Wth so many people,
we haven't even a little prayer.

342
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,119
Michel knows them.

343
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:31,915
You're right...

344
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,679
- I'm in disgrace.
- Come down!

345
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:37,445
So I'm not in disgrace?

346
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,324
Say your prayers.

347
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:48,596
On your knees.

348
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,727
Our Father,
blessed art thou among women.

349
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:56,358
Give us our daily bread and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

350
00:35:56,527 --> 00:36:01,476
Pray for us sinners,
Thy will be full of grace.

351
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:06,084
Our Father, Mother of God,
give us our... bread!

352
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,522
Damn! Damn, damn, damn...

353
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,681
Our Father who art in heaven...

354
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:28,595
- Needs a laxative.
- There's castor oil.

355
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,246
Give him some.

356
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:37,562
If it doesn't help, it won't hurt.

357
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:43,280
Can't you open your mouth?

358
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:46,520
His eyes are like Gran's.

359
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:50,006
We must be gentle.

360
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:54,080
Be reasonable, Georges.
At least open your eyes.

361
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:57,125
- They're closed now.
- Maybe he's sleeping!

362
00:36:57,287 --> 00:36:59,926
Here, drink this.

363
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:03,846
Give it to him.

364
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:09,045
He's clenched his teeth.

365
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,237
Maybe he's dead.

366
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:20,283
"Our Father who art in heaven,

367
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:24,395
"Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

368
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,956
"Give us our daily bread.

369
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:30,563
"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us,

370
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,797
"and lead us not into temptation,

371
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:35,197
"but deliver us from evil."

372
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:48,645
"May God receive him into paradise."

373
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,717
I think he's dead. Look.

374
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:08,084
I think so too. He's dead.

375
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,639
What do you say, mother?

376
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:19,758
It's certain he's dead.

377
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:21,280
He's dead?

378
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:28,877
Your brother's dead?

379
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,358
WII you dig him a hole?

380
00:38:33,727 --> 00:38:37,037
Are you crazy? He's my brother.

381
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,161
My poor Georges...

382
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:44,198
You saw how he left silently.

383
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:46,881
One couldn't have known, or helped.

384
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:51,162
If I'd given it to him sooner...

385
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:53,921
You don't know it would've helped.

386
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:55,998
Oh, you're just saying that...

387
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,397
Certainly I'm saying that.

388
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:08,681
Give me a nail.

389
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:11,801
A big one.

390
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:27,085
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

391
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:30,037
Not bad, not bad at all.

392
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,477
WII the crosses stay on
up there?

393
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:37,320
Yes, they will. Need me any more?

394
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,685
Give me a nail and that's it.

395
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:07,799
Not like that, idiot.

396
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,316
I have crosses...

397
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:12,636
I have three.

398
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:15,924
Why three? There's only my dog
and the mole.

399
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:17,316
You're right.

400
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,642
No, you already had some.

401
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:22,360
Do you like chickens?

402
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:19,721
Everybody up!

403
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:22,960
What is it?

404
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:29,966
Well!

405
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:40,002
- Gouard's son?
- Why? The war's not over.

406
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,362
Wth bums like him...

407
00:41:42,527 --> 00:41:44,995
Look and tell me if it's Francis.

408
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,237
I'll cut the grass
for the rabbits.

409
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:23,724
No more leaders, no more English.

410
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:26,160
So I said to myself:

411
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:31,843
It's not worth marching forever.
Don't touch that.

412
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:36,559
So I left and here I am.

413
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:39,287
Where are the Prussians?

414
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,879
They're probably not far.

415
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:50,642
- In the cavalry, we had horses.
- Half-tracks are faster.

416
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:53,959
In '1 8, we didn't need to run.

417
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:57,802
If you'd had Messerschmidts
on your tail, you'd have run.

418
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:09,359
- You need help? What're you up to?
- Cutting grass.

419
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:11,876
- It's not yours.
- Papa told me to.

420
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:20,685
It's Francis.

421
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:24,479
And they ask how we lost the war!

422
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:28,245
You watch you don't gape at him.

423
00:43:28,407 --> 00:43:29,601
Me?

424
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:48,675
Hello.

425
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:50,081
How are you?

426
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:52,481
Asleep?

427
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,680
Look...

428
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,719
They're hot.

429
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:08,045
Are you happy?

430
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,599
- You swear it wasn't you killed them?
- No.

431
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:15,317
I wanted to give them a drink.

432
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,877
Their eyes were closed.
I thought: "Maybe they're asleep."

433
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:20,960
I'll give them a wreath.

434
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:25,285
Their teeth were clenched.
So I thought: "Maybe they're dead."

435
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,762
Why?

436
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:29,646
It's like that... Are you happy?

437
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:46,802
You're a corporal?

438
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:49,242
Yes, I was promoted in battle.

439
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:53,044
- Who told you I watch the cows?
- Michel!

440
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,643
He's a clever one.

441
00:44:57,567 --> 00:45:00,445
Be careful, there's the kid.

442
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:02,555
Who is that kid?

443
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:05,639
That's Paulette, Michel's friend.

444
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:09,239
He's a clever one, Michel.

445
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,001
Yes, he is.

446
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:20,081
Five... six...

447
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:22,437
It's far. It's the bridge.

448
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:30,643
I haven't got the nerve.
They're following me.

449
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:33,086
So? No more love?

450
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:37,406
Is Paulette here?

451
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:40,002
- I'll say.
- Go away, you kids!

452
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,525
Have you got the chickens?

453
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,122
See what I have.

454
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:57,280
They're awful.

455
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,285
You're never satisfied.

456
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:29,678
Do we have to take it inside?

457
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:33,237
It's because of the bottom plank.

458
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:36,526
It's not very sturdy.

459
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:39,838
If we keep moving it around...

460
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:41,486
We have to.

461
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:15,846
Such a thing!

462
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:17,963
You shouldn't have...

463
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,517
It was the last one,
but it's got "cousin" written on it.

464
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:24,759
- It's not important.
- Yes, it is.

465
00:47:30,607 --> 00:47:31,676
Hang on.

466
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,158
You wouldn't say
there's a war on here.

467
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:43,037
- At least he'll have a Christian burial.
- And a mass.

468
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:46,358
- Joseph, you're not going?
- In a second.

469
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:51,959
Ten... eleven...

470
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:54,682
twelve...

471
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:59,766
thirteen... fourteen...

472
00:48:59,927 --> 00:49:01,679
Those don't come apart.

473
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:03,803
They're not very pretty.

474
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:05,366
Finished talking?

475
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:12,126
Look.

476
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,158
That'll be good for a bee.

477
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:15,476
Yes, but it stings.

478
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:18,286
It stings, but it's harmless.

479
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,995
The hearse broke down,
like Francis' half-track.

480
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,158
- Don't laugh.
- Why shouldn't I?

481
00:49:40,447 --> 00:49:41,960
Well, I never...

482
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:50,445
Would you believe it?

483
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:00,206
Michel, come here.

484
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:05,396
Do what your father says.

485
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:19,958
I told you to check the crosses.

486
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,042
- They held all right.
- They've come off.

487
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,444
Look for them on the road.

488
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:28,519
No, we've not lost them.
I'd have noticed.

489
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:33,042
If they're not lost,
someone's taken them.

490
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:35,405
Who'd do that?

491
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:37,360
I don't know.

492
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:39,605
Maybe the Gouards.

493
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:44,001
The bell's ringing,
we must go back to pray.

494
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:50,679
Yes, maybe the Gouards.

495
00:51:01,087 --> 00:51:04,716
He saw there are no more crosses.
I said it was the Gouards.

496
00:51:06,407 --> 00:51:07,396
Look at that!

497
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:09,686
Yes, it's the pastor's.

498
00:51:11,927 --> 00:51:13,485
It's pretty.

499
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:24,158
I would have gone to the funeral
if I'd known.

500
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:26,320
You couldn't know!

501
00:51:26,607 --> 00:51:28,165
But they said nothing.

502
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,640
All the same, they've got problems...

503
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:34,238
Who have they got left now?

504
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:36,601
Raymond's no use.

505
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:40,204
There's Berthe, she's a good worker.

506
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:42,206
A whore.

507
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:45,967
Hey, be more polite.

508
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:48,602
You're defending her?

509
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:50,243
Yes.

510
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,126
You should've defended France
with your iron horses.

511
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:55,596
I can't marry France.

512
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:59,960
Maybe you'll marry Berthe Dollé?

513
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:01,879
Maybe, yes.

514
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:05,001
You'd have to be in cavalry
to be that dull.

515
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:08,445
Well, if all the horses
in the cavalry kicked you,

516
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:11,480
- It'd clear your head.
- Don't speak to me like that!

517
00:52:13,487 --> 00:52:16,365
Yes, and that's not all!

518
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:18,603
I'll marry Berthe, you hear me?

519
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,600
That's that then...

520
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:53,800
A few words to a family
that is seeing very hard times.

521
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,723
That'd do for a mare.

522
00:52:57,687 --> 00:53:00,645
That one for a pigeon.

523
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:03,796
A cat.

524
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:06,043
But a big one.

525
00:53:10,127 --> 00:53:11,958
And that one for a giraffe.

526
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:16,005
I said, that's Gouard's work.

527
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,646
Have you proof?

528
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:20,002
- He's in for us.
- They say I'm a deserter.

529
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,397
- Why is he in for you?
- He's jealous.

530
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:26,242
That's no reason to steal the crosses.

531
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:29,438
When I was fixing the hearse,

532
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:32,445
those brats went by sneering.

533
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:34,757
Francis is more a deserter than me.

534
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:37,999
I'll kick his guts out
if he keeps it up.

535
00:53:38,407 --> 00:53:40,079
I respect the dead.

536
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,518
But they have no respect at all.

537
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:10,445
- You took the crosses from the hearse?
- Yes, Father.

538
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:12,961
But why?

539
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:15,163
- For a gift?
- For whom?

540
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:16,521
I can't say.

541
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:21,642
Well, you bring them back
and make your act of contrition.

542
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,806
Twice, Father.

543
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:16,446
You're all the same!

544
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:17,995
I had a good reason.

545
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,762
Certainly, but you put the cart
before the horse.

546
00:55:21,927 --> 00:55:23,679
We want to get married...

547
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:27,796
We just don't dare tell our parents...

548
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,004
And we thought you might...

549
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,476
- Reconcile them?
- Yes, that's right.

550
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:48,796
Michel, I saw you.

551
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:08,763
The cross from the altar...

552
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:12,920
You haven't even finished your penance
and you start over!

553
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:15,366
Get out!

554
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:16,841
What's he done now?

555
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,556
It doesn't concern you.
Go back in, we're not done.

556
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:37,516
Did you speak to Gouard?

557
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:40,042
Yes, I did.

558
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:49,676
I said: "Now you steal
crosses from hearses?"

559
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:52,281
He said: "What crosses?"

560
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:54,200
So I said: "Don't lie."

561
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:56,037
And he said:

562
00:56:56,247 --> 00:57:00,798
"As to the crosses,
I swear on my wife's grave."

563
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:02,958
So much for her grave!

564
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:05,641
Let me finish...
That's what I said.

565
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:08,446
I said: "You have no right
to swear on her grave."

566
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,167
It's not a grave, it's a slum.

567
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:17,796
Swear all you want on her grave,
it'd be better to clean it.

568
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:24,405
Why weren't they at the funeral?
That proves it.

569
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,842
- No one told him.
- Maybe they didn't know.

570
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:29,601
They knew even if they weren't told.

571
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:42,676
I'm fed up with his bugle.

572
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:45,202
It's not a bugle, it's a trumpet.

573
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:49,406
Whatever it is,
he's still a deserter.

574
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:57,403
We need two, since there are two graves.

575
00:57:57,647 --> 00:57:59,399
Dog... worm... cricket

576
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,726
What's that?

577
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:03,201
A cockroach.

578
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:10,320
Does it bite?

579
00:58:10,807 --> 00:58:12,399
No, but it stinks.

580
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,955
Don't kill them.

581
00:58:19,127 --> 00:58:22,517
It's not me, it's a bomb.
Are you crazy?

582
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:26,561
Don't kill them! Don't kill them!

583
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:29,767
They must be dead to bury them.

584
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:32,566
- I won't talk to you.
- Idiot!

585
00:58:32,727 --> 00:58:35,799
Anyway, you promised me
the priest's cross.

586
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:37,719
You're not fair.

587
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,040
I don't want it.

588
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:47,402
What is it?

589
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:50,035
- A doll's hand.
- I don't want it.

590
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:53,286
You're mad about the cross...

591
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:57,924
That bastard, he'll get us spotted
by the planes.

592
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:02,080
OK, kids!

593
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:04,636
Bed!

594
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,963
- Good night, Mr. Dollé.
- 'Night, sugar.

595
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:35,723
- What are you doing?
- Finished kissing everyone?

596
00:59:35,887 --> 00:59:37,161
Shall I kiss you?

597
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:39,238
- You're not nice.
- Why?

598
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:42,717
- What you said about the cross.
- You didn't give it to me.

599
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:45,123
I tried, I got slapped.

600
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:48,082
Here, kiss me here.

601
00:59:48,687 --> 00:59:49,961
Better than that.

602
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:53,800
I said, get to bed.
The time for kisses is over!

603
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,286
I'm coming.

604
01:00:00,087 --> 01:00:02,647
I know a place with crosses.

605
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,321
- Where?
- The cemetery.

606
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:07,996
You're not afraid?

607
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:09,402
Why?

608
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:12,720
But if the dead grab me by the feet?

609
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:14,235
I don't want to.

610
01:00:14,607 --> 01:00:17,201
- Shall I come up?
- I'll come down.

611
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:22,036
It's a joke, they're not scary.

612
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:29,400
What does that mean,
"cart before the horse"?

613
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:33,199
It's what we're doing.

614
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:37,523
I've never heard it called that.

615
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:54,881
- We'll take the wheelbarrow.
- Why?

616
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,203
We'll fill it with crosses!

617
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:05,322
I'm afraid.

618
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:07,443
It's a rocket. Close your eyes.

619
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:10,405
I can't see if I close my eyes.

620
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:14,400
What are you doing?

621
01:01:15,447 --> 01:01:17,563
- And you?
- Is it any of your business?

622
01:01:17,727 --> 01:01:19,445
I'm getting the wheelbarrow.

623
01:01:24,087 --> 01:01:25,156
I see...

624
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:27,045
- You see what?
- Nothing...

625
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,245
- A wheelbarrow at this hour!
- We're going to get snails.

626
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,721
- You're not afraid?
- No, are you?

627
01:01:53,887 --> 01:01:56,526
No, shall I sing?

628
01:01:56,687 --> 01:01:57,961
If you want.

629
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:20,636
Lie down.

630
01:02:20,807 --> 01:02:22,718
They can't see us. Come on, quick.

631
01:02:22,887 --> 01:02:24,206
We lost a cross.

632
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:26,164
We've got plenty.

633
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:58,519
He loved daisies.

634
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,757
We'll make a nice garden
on his grave.

635
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:03,077
It's the first mass without him.

636
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:04,441
Take it off.

637
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:07,439
I don't want to go.

638
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:09,757
- Take that.
- And that.

639
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:21,286
- Go pick some flowers.
- Why?

640
01:03:21,447 --> 01:03:23,677
Hurry up, pick some flowers.

641
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:25,883
They're not the only ones who suffer.

642
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:38,161
My God!

643
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,326
That's Georges' cross.

644
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:44,204
It sure is.
The price is still on the back.

645
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:45,766
That's strange.

646
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:47,440
It didn't get here by itself.

647
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:49,916
- There! It's obvious.
- Why?

648
01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:52,317
- That proves it.
- Proves what?

649
01:03:52,487 --> 01:03:54,079
She's right, that proves it.

650
01:03:58,287 --> 01:03:59,561
I'm not going.

651
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,399
There are the Gouards.

652
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:08,602
A slum, he said...

653
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,758
It'll be prettier than theirs.

654
01:04:26,247 --> 01:04:27,805
The cross has gone.

655
01:04:28,487 --> 01:04:30,921
Just a hole. It's not there.

656
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,566
My God!

657
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:35,882
Watch!

658
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:21,361
Bastard!

659
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:23,280
Vampire!

660
01:05:23,527 --> 01:05:24,721
Bastard!

661
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:26,201
Landru...

662
01:05:34,247 --> 01:05:37,045
- You're quite a sight!
- Did you hurt yourself?

663
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:38,362
And you?

664
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,046
Answer me.

665
01:05:41,207 --> 01:05:43,596
Joseph, watch out, he's a bad one.

666
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,876
This is no place for a fight.

667
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:49,607
Where did you fight, deserter?

668
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:51,440
You're the deserter.

669
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:53,882
I was rejected for albumin.

670
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:05,477
That's enough.

671
01:06:06,927 --> 01:06:09,395
Aren't you ashamed, you family men!

672
01:06:09,647 --> 01:06:13,037
- He stole Georges' cross.
- I don't rob the dead.

673
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:14,401
Who did then?

674
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,035
It's not him.

675
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:23,162
I know the one who steals crosses.
He tried to steal the altar cross.

676
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,846
Michel, come here!

677
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:41,846
Wait for me!

678
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:45,678
Bunch of bastards!

679
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,882
If he's not home, he's scared of you.

680
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:50,684
- He's right!
- Don't harm him.

681
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:54,523
I can't. I don't know where he is.

682
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:33,195
Does it hurt?

683
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:37,042
What could he have done
with fourteen crosses?

684
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:38,801
I don't understand.

685
01:08:39,007 --> 01:08:40,804
- Go to bed.
- Let me finish.

686
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:43,162
- What is it?
- I don't know, but it's nice.

687
01:08:45,407 --> 01:08:46,635
Fourteen...

688
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:51,838
Fourteen, I counted them with the pastor.

689
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,838
And that's not counting Georges'!

690
01:08:55,487 --> 01:08:57,205
The Galuchets: one.

691
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:01,760
The Bredillons: two.
The widow Entrat: three.

692
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:04,521
- The Gouards!
- Shut up!

693
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,035
What'll it cost!

694
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:08,920
It's simple: Georges' was 250 franos.

695
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,398
250 multiplied by 1 4...

696
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:13,757
Take 1 4 and carry...

697
01:09:14,207 --> 01:09:17,244
You never could count!
Wait till I find him.

698
01:10:00,887 --> 01:10:02,479
Why don't you want to?

699
01:10:02,647 --> 01:10:03,966
Tell me...

700
01:10:11,447 --> 01:10:12,641
Since you know,

701
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:14,918
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

702
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,317
Yes, you do. Your nose is twitching.

703
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:20,565
- Why?
- It twitches when you lie.

704
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:24,202
You realize what Michel did?

705
01:10:24,447 --> 01:10:28,281
Rob his brother's cross!
Is that nice?

706
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:32,959
I didn't ask you to cry.
I asked where they are.

707
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:36,357
What were they for?
They're not toys.

708
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:38,479
No, not toys.

709
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:39,875
Don't hold your nose.

710
01:10:41,447 --> 01:10:44,166
Mr. Dollé will spank you.

711
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:47,160
Until your bottom is black and blue.

712
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:50,046
So you just have to tell me...

713
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:54,803
and I'll go get them
and it'll be over. Isn't that better?

714
01:10:57,527 --> 01:10:59,995
You see. Where are they?

715
01:11:02,527 --> 01:11:04,006
I don't know.

716
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,045
Then why did you get
the wheelbarrow from the barn?

717
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:09,245
I'll tell Mr. Dollé.

718
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:11,238
What'll you tell him?

719
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,318
So there you are.

720
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:16,286
Me too, I'll tell him.

721
01:11:16,727 --> 01:11:19,639
- What?
- Who you were with in the barn.

722
01:11:20,727 --> 01:11:22,365
- Liar!
- You too!

723
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:24,320
- I'll call him.
- Go on!

724
01:11:29,647 --> 01:11:30,682
Don't be smart.

725
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:35,926
I said, bed!

726
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:44,159
I've locked up. If he comes tonight,

727
01:11:44,327 --> 01:11:47,080
let him in and call me.

728
01:11:49,487 --> 01:11:51,000
She didn't say anything?

729
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:52,880
Good night, angel.

730
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:58,444
The light's not for reading.

731
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,404
I can't see to get undressed.

732
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,080
What have you to show?

733
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:06,725
Good night, Mr. Raymond.

734
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:09,685
I'll say good night
when you return the crosses.

735
01:12:16,727 --> 01:12:18,558
- You coming?
- Where?

736
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:21,764
- To the cemetery.
- Not now, it's dark.

737
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:25,126
Anyway he's locked everything.
We'll go tomorrow.

738
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:27,357
- Is it nice?
- You bet!

739
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:31,403
All the crosses and the names!

740
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:32,966
Tell me.

741
01:12:36,767 --> 01:12:38,166
I put some stones on.

742
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:42,196
All the animals, and flowers too.

743
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:45,643
Broken plates... snails...

744
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:54,158
I'm going to sleep in the barn.

745
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,480
You're here?

746
01:13:14,647 --> 01:13:15,875
Hello.

747
01:13:20,607 --> 01:13:22,757
- Let's go!
- Where?

748
01:13:22,927 --> 01:13:24,838
To see the cemetery.

749
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,646
I'm hungry.

750
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:35,486
I don't like apples.

751
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,445
That's all I have.

752
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:40,558
I like white coffee better.

753
01:13:41,047 --> 01:13:42,526
You're not easy to please.

754
01:14:01,487 --> 01:14:04,524
The Gourads have filed a complaint!

755
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:07,645
Think it's funny?
Are you going to pay for the crosses?

756
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:16,560
- And that brat's not back!
- He's not far.

757
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:18,797
- Can't you say?
- You didn't ask.

758
01:14:20,407 --> 01:14:21,635
Michel...

759
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:39,325
- Damn it, the police!
- What'll they do to us?

760
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,877
Swear you won't say anything.

761
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:45,239
No, say "I swear"'.

762
01:14:45,407 --> 01:14:46,476
I swear.

763
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:50,800
I swear too.
Cross my heart and hope to die.

764
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:55,718
Bravo! The police are here.

765
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,998
Tell me where the crosses are.

766
01:15:09,527 --> 01:15:12,360
Tell me, you stubborn little brat.

767
01:15:12,527 --> 01:15:14,677
Tell me where they are.

768
01:15:15,767 --> 01:15:16,756
I won't.

769
01:15:16,927 --> 01:15:18,406
You'd rather go to prison?

770
01:15:18,567 --> 01:15:19,886
Yes, I would.

771
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:24,726
Fourteen crosses. For God's sake.

772
01:15:25,327 --> 01:15:27,795
What did you do with the crosses?

773
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:30,240
Fourteen crosses...

774
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:34,565
Fourteen thousand kicks in the pants!

775
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,640
- Let him be!
- Can't you see I'm busy?

776
01:16:03,607 --> 01:16:06,440
They didn't come for that!
It's for Paulette.

777
01:16:07,047 --> 01:16:09,242
They've come to take her.

778
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:16,606
I don't want them to!

779
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:21,241
They won't hurt her.
They'll take her to an orphanage.

780
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:22,681
I don't want to go.

781
01:16:22,847 --> 01:16:25,441
- She's not going.
- We can't keep her.

782
01:16:25,607 --> 01:16:27,245
Who's the boss?

783
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,318
Don't be afraid, they're kind.

784
01:16:29,487 --> 01:16:31,921
If I tell where they are,
you'll keep her?

785
01:16:32,687 --> 01:16:36,157
- It's nothing to do with it.
- Then you'll never get them, never!

786
01:16:36,327 --> 01:16:38,841
- We'll see.
- You won't get them that way.

787
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:43,115
If she stays, we'll give the crosses back
and apologize to everyone.

788
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:46,165
And she'll go to catechism
and help around the home.

789
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:47,402
And marry you...

790
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:49,956
- Tell me where they are.
- Promise me.

791
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:53,242
All right, tell me.

792
01:16:56,087 --> 01:16:57,520
Tell me where they are.

793
01:16:57,927 --> 01:16:59,280
Tell him, Michel.

794
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:01,885
They're at the mill.

795
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:03,162
The mill?

796
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,885
Why the mill?

797
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,396
Come with me.

798
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:14,485
There she is, the poor thing.

799
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:16,160
Hello, little girl.

800
01:17:16,687 --> 01:17:18,040
What's your name?

801
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,479
- What's her name?
- We call her Paulette.

802
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:24,920
Your parents
were killed in the bombings?

803
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:26,839
- No.
- What?

804
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:29,077
- She told us that.
- "No"?

805
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:30,640
Think, my child!

806
01:17:30,807 --> 01:17:32,763
Don't be afraid, she'll remember.

807
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:34,804
Was she affected, maybe?

808
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:37,800
We haven't even her name.

809
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:41,004
Your name's Paulette what?

810
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:43,879
- Paulette what?
- Dollé.

811
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:47,762
She calls herself Dollé now.

812
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:50,163
I want Michel's name.

813
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:51,800
Children are like that.

814
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,561
- We need the facts.
- You'll take her though?

815
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:56,160
To the Red Cross.

816
01:17:56,327 --> 01:17:58,966
You're going for a ride
with these nice men.

817
01:17:59,127 --> 01:18:00,845
In a car, too!

818
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:05,765
Sign here, Mr. Dollé.

819
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,685
You can't, you promised.

820
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:14,963
I didn't promise, so shut up.

821
01:18:15,127 --> 01:18:16,196
Liar!

822
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:18,278
You say that to your father?

823
01:18:18,447 --> 01:18:22,235
He said she could stay
if I said where the crosses are.

824
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:23,476
You be quiet.

825
01:18:23,647 --> 01:18:25,478
You'll never get them now!

826
01:18:27,527 --> 01:18:29,597
- What crosses?
- The crosses!

827
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:03,040
Keep it a hundred years.

828
01:20:42,367 --> 01:20:44,676
Don't lose it now.

829
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:51,838
Has she told you her name?

830
01:20:52,927 --> 01:20:55,316
You'll see, Paulette...

831
01:20:55,927 --> 01:20:57,599
You'll see, you'll like it.

832
01:20:57,847 --> 01:21:00,315
Wth little girls just like you!

833
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:03,758
Wth many sorrows,
but very happy all together.

834
01:21:06,207 --> 01:21:08,641
Now don't move. Be good.

835
01:21:20,847 --> 01:21:21,882
Michel!

836
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:47,120
Mama!
