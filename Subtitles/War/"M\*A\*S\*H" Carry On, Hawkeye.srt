<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

2
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,158
<i>Because of the epidemic,</i>
<i>tonight's broken film,</i>

3
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,163
<i>which has not arrived yet,</i>

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,165
<i>is canceled.</i>

5
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,167
<i>A reminder from Colonel Blake:</i>

6
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,602
<i>Due to the flu,</i>
<i>kindly refrain from kissing anyone,</i>

7
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,072
<i>unless absolutely necessary.</i>

8
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:24,172
Come on, Trap.
See if you can bite the spoon.

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,912
Well, you eat it all, you can see
the picture at the bottom of the bowl.

10
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,888
The Three Little Pigs in escrow.

11
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:37,087
Why do doctors always make
such lousy patients?

12
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,496
If you were a patient,
would you trust you?

13
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,729
Come on, now.
One for General MacArthur?

14
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,499
<i>He hasn't had a thing.</i>

15
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,597
Pierce-comma-Hawkeye.

16
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,542
Lieutenant Anderson.
Sheila.

17
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,375
- You look new.
- Only one owner.

18
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,348
- Oh, sense of humor.
- <i>[Mclntyre] Hey.</i>

19
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,783
My nose has no teeth.

20
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,218
Oh, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,586
<i>Lieutenant Anderson,</i>
<i>this is Captain Mclntyre.</i>

22
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,956
A doctor with the 24-hour flu,
which is now in its third day.

23
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,460
Hi.

24
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,464
I wish we'd met when I was alive.

25
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,057
Come on, now.
One for Ward Bond?

26
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,262
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention, all O.R. Personnel.</i>

27
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,499
- <i>Attention. Incoming casualties.</i>
- They're playing our announcement.

28
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,599
See if you can get him to eat something.
Otherwise, start him on I.V.

29
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,645
<i>If he makes a grab at you, let him.</i>
<i>He needs the exercise.</i>

30
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,977
You'll be playing the violin again
in no time.

31
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,508
You know, there's a good chance
I may not catch that old devil flu.

32
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,521
- Oh?
- You have your own private immunity?

33
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,423
You're invulnerable to viral infections?

34
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,427
I breathe through my ears.

35
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,725
Pipe down, will you, Pierce?

36
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,095
It's like living in a wind tunnel,
but it fools the germs...

37
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,498
hanging around my nose.

38
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,834
- You okay, Jacobs?
- I'll be all right, Doctor.

39
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,896
Ah, that's good.

40
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,411
- 'Cause I'm deathly ill.
- [Pierce] What's the matter?

41
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,611
Stop doing Jolson and get to bed.

42
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,176
I'm fine. Fine.
I'll be just fine.

43
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,188
Jacobs, put him to bed.

44
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,816
- Take the next one for yourself.
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

45
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,883
Put a screen in between your beds.

46
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,259
He's most dangerous
when he's on his back.

47
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,992
Don't thank me until you get my bill.

48
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,628
The big, dumb strong ones
always go first.

49
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,035
- Suction.
- Suction.

50
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,097
Getting ready to close.

51
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,303
Four-oh silk, and mop my forehead.

52
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,313
- Doctor, I just did.
- Don't argue with me. Just do what I...

53
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,552
The lights...

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,783
- Doctor!
- Stay where you are. Don't leave.

55
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,654
<i>Father, give him a stool.</i>

56
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,956
- Can you land the plane by yourself?
- I think so.

57
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,966
- All right. Help Sheila.
- Gloves.

58
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,492
<i>Nothing clever. Just close</i>
<i>and call me when you're finished.</i>

59
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,871
- Right.
- Belly up to the instrument tray.

60
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,308
Give him some gloves here.
Left one first.

61
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,643
Four-oh silk on Keith needle.

62
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:12,377
- Deever retractor.
- What?

63
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,319
Deever retractor.
The curly thing with the curl.

64
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,221
Oh, oh. A Deever retractor.

65
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,726
They do give them complicated names.

66
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,922
That's the cross we bear, Father.

67
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:28,831
- How's Frank?
- He's unconscious.

68
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,704
Saving lives at last.

69
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,933
<i>Suction, Father.</i>

70
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,941
Coming right up.

71
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,412
Father, since we're working together,
is it all right if I call you Dad?

72
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,949
<i>[Pierce]</i>
<i>Look, General, I realize...</i>

73
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:48,145
<i>that flu is epidemic in the whole</i>

74
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,212
<i>I'm a humble captain.</i>

75
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,851
<i>Yeah, l</i>... <i>Yes, I know</i>...
<i>I know I'm a capable young surgeon.</i>

76
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,862
Let me add I have good prospects
and I'm a great catch,

77
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,864
but I'm not looking for a husband.

78
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,866
I need help here.

79
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,996
Just send me some hands.
Anybody. Jack the Ripper.

80
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,506
Anybody who's good with a knife.

81
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,508
Wait...

82
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,281
General, I understand the problem.
When am I gonna get somebody here?

83
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,484
Days?

84
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:25,654
Uh... Thank you, General.
You've been a big help.

85
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,954
Everything I said to him
went in one star and out the other.

86
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,731
Well, anything I can do to help.

87
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,733
That's a nice offer, Radar,

88
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,827
but unless you can graduate medical
school in the next two hours, forget it.

89
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,767
I suppose you realize
you're ranking surgeon now.

90
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,936
It's hard to believe
I'm sitting in Henry Blake's chair.

91
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,413
This is the chair from which a thousand
indecisions have been launched.

92
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,677
Yes, sir.

93
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:57,177
- Tell you what we're gonna do, Radar.
- Check the personnel directory.

94
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,588
Call Seoul, Tokyo, Okinawa and Pusan,

95
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,423
see if we can get another surgeon
that can come in here and help you.

96
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,430
- You put the words right into my mouth.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,432
Don't get fresh.

98
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,673
<i>[Pierce]</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

99
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,883
Margaret! I've done this often,
but I never dare dream it.

100
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,055
Mind your tongue.

101
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:34,957
Frank's flat on his back.
I think we should follow his example.

102
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,894
Frank wants his Bible.
Where is it?

103
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,956
It's over there under his catalog
from theJapanese sex shop.

104
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,934
He doesn't have one of those.

105
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,671
<i>He's even making a shopping list.</i>

106
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,672
You'll find the page creased
under the inflatables section.

107
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:56,680
- Patch kits included.
- Be serious for just one minute, please.

108
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:00,083
I am, Margaret.

109
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:04,316
You know, there's
a frontier feeling around here.

110
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,382
Joel McCrea is in bed. So is
Ralph Bellamy and Colonel Andy Devine.

111
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,021
Now there's just you and me...
Frances Dee and Slim Summerville.

112
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,422
Why do you talk like that?

113
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,832
I can't help it.
I'm part of the movie generation.

114
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:20,996
I spent every Saturday morning
and afternoon in the dark.

115
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,336
I'm really not interested.

116
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,377
I could easily have been
a mushroom instead of a doctor.

117
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:31,473
<i>I'll tell you what you're not.</i>
<i>You're not Commanding Officer.</i>

118
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:36,612
- Oh, yeah?
- As a major, I'm next in command.

119
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:39,248
Okay, you take charge.

120
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:45,629
You've just been waiting for a chance
to take over, haven't you?

121
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:50,634
Look, I want a command about as much as
I want a scholarship to Devil's Island.

122
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:53,603
Let's have a clear understanding.

123
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:56,401
You won't take yes for an answer,
will you?

124
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:59,602
I'll get to the real thrust
of what I'm saying.

125
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:01,611
You're the sorest winner I ever met.

126
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:07,083
You've emasculated me for the last time.
I'm in charge now.

127
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,085
Okay, Madame President.

128
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,919
You take care of the surgical matters,
and I'll handle administration.

129
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:15,585
We'll be so busy
we'll never see each other, darling.

130
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,594
<i>[Helicopters Approaching]</i>

00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,067
After you, sir.

132
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,540
I suppose you're wondering why
I asked you all here tonight.

133
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,910
Years ago, each of you
did something terrible to me.

134
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:38,915
What <i>are</i> you talking about?

135
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,917
Nothing. You're in charge.
You take over.

136
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:44,978
Don't be foolish. I wouldn't presume
to tell you anything about surgery.

137
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,047
All right, let's get organized.
Father.

138
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,059
You'll be working with Sheila.

139
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:52,290
This is a promising young surgeon
who prays a lot.

140
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:56,226
Got a great touch,
especially on Sunday.

141
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,235
All right.

142
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:03,504
- Okay, uh, scalpel.
- Scalpel.

143
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,179
- Kelly clamp.
- Kelly.

144
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,681
Okay, promising young surgeon,
give me your hand.

145
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:20,450
All right, hold that down,
right there. You got it?

146
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:23,585
- Yes, I'm holding it.
- All right. Don't let go of it.

147
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,152
All right.
There are no fragments.

148
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,427
- Irrigate the wound and pack it over.
- Yes, Doctor.

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,867
Margaret? Over here.
Kelly, gloves.

150
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:37,271
You're really in charge here, Commander.
You'll work with Wilson.

151
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:40,607
You're so scared, I'd like to
put my sterile arms around you.

152
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:44,444
- I'm okay.
- Okay. Scalpel.

153
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:46,449
<i>Scalpel.</i>

154
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:51,386
I'll open up the paradidymal and see
what we've got, or rather what he's got.

155
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,390
I'm ready.

156
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,427
That's what I tried to tell you
when we were alone.

157
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:59,429
Okay, uh, Charlie,
I'm in the M's now.

158
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:03,263
Uh, what about this guy:
Martin, Robert H.?

159
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,268
He's listed as a chest cutter.

160
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,229
He's a pediatrician?

161
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,242
Uh, Charlie,
we get very few pregnant soldiers.

162
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,581
- Pierce!
- Coming, Mother.

163
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,585
- Nice job. That was good help.
- Thank you.

164
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,789
What's happening?

165
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:29,156
- I... I'm not sure.
- That's perfect.

166
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,752
I've never done this before.

167
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:35,060
Bet you can't remember
the first time you said that.

168
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,624
Just put a clamp on
that other bleeder there.

169
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:40,296
Hawkeye, could I trouble you?

170
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,430
Coming, Father.

171
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,441
<i>Okay, sponge.</i>

172
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,943
Uh, hi. Harry? Uh, right.

173
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,377
Radar O'Reilly over at 4077 th?

174
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:54,510
Yeah, listen. Has your outfit got
a Dr. Anthony McDonald, General Surgeon?

175
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,687
Huh?

176
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:00,246
He changed to psychiatry?

177
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:02,952
That's crazy.

178
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:06,019
[All Chattering]

179
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:08,531
Is that really his gallbladder
I'm holding?

180
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,329
It ain't his money belt, partner.
Hold it.

181
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,269
Ready to close now, Doctor.

182
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:19,708
I'll be right there. Meantime, look
for your wristwatch. Surgeon's joke.

183
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,871
I don't feel well.

184
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:27,145
Would you be good enough to
take this gallbladder off my hands?

185
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,448
- Okay. Richardson retractor.
- Richardson.

186
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,454
- <i>[Houlihan] Pierce!</i>
- <i>Just a second.</i>

187
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:34,355
Hold that back, will you, Sheila?
Metzenbaum scissors.

188
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,359
- Metz.
- Hawkeye?

189
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,895
- Yeah? What? Any luck?
- No, I struck out.

190
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:41,056
I called Okinawa, Seoul, Tokyo.

191
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:44,067
Everybody's got the flu,
or they won't come, or whatever.

192
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:47,229
We may have to close the war. Clamp.

193
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,535
- <i>[Sheila] I'm out of clamps.</i>
- <i>Well, get some, quick.</i>

194
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:54,067
Not you, Sheila. Get back here.
Hold that. Father, get us some clamps.

195
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:57,706
- We've got to close him now.
- Somebody get us... I'll be right there.

196
00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:59,716
- Wait a minute.
- <i>[Houlihan] I've got to close him now.</i>

197
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,718
Will you wait a minute?

198
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:06,951
- [All Speaking At Once]
- My kingdom for an intelligent octopus!

199
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:14,226
Hi, dear.
Having a tough day at the office?

200
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,459
Just filling out the daily report.

201
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,661
Add these.
Pints of blood used.

202
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,967
Pints of blood needed.
Progress of cases reports.

203
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,701
And on page six,
you'll find my resignation.

204
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:28,109
If you skip every other word,
you'll see it's also a suicide note.

205
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,977
Don't be facetious.

206
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,710
All right, then I'll go home
as a deserter, in chains, anything.

207
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:36,982
- That will do, Captain.
- I don't care. I'm getting out of here.

208
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:39,818
And I'm taking you with me, Margaret.
We'll send for Frank later.

209
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:43,452
Can I interest you in a little...

210
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,053
Have you examined the flu patients?

211
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,826
Frank's temp is up.
Henry's is down.

212
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,461
Trapper seems to be hovering
between Sheila and Shirley.

213
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,995
He'll be able to play Saturday
in the big game with Abnormal State.

214
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:59,634
I'm gonna sack out.
You want anything from me before I go?

215
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,803
I'm yours.

216
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:07,717
Well, I have something
a bit more constructive.

217
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:10,720
A new serum.
It came in on the last chopper.

218
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,222
They think it might prevent the flu.

219
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,759
- It's experimental.
- [Laughing]

220
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:20,025
Classic army thinking: Locking the barn
after the horse has the flu.

221
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,031
It may help.

222
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:25,125
We ought to immunize each other.

223
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:28,502
Margaret, another dream come true.

224
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:31,337
I think we ought to give
each other injections.

225
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:34,435
I'm no good with a needle.
I never have been.

226
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,446
I can take it.

227
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,751
- Where do you want it?
- In my arm.

228
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,682
Party pooper.

229
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:47,117
- Ah!
- Told you I was lousy.

230
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:53,429
Maybe we are in a movie.
You're Bette Davis and I'm George Brent.

231
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,201
- You do me.
- Roll up your sleeve.

232
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,500
- Uh-uh.
- What do you mean, "uh-uh"?

233
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:04,166
I want mine in my tushy.

234
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:07,768
- You what?
- Derriere. The back of my front.

235
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:12,043
The fleshy part. I can't take pain.
I can only give it.

236
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,217
All right.
Lower your trousers.

237
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,983
I thought you'd never ask.

238
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:22,184
Only as far as you have to.

239
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,960
- You're just loving this, aren't you?
- Aren't you?

240
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:34,837
- Let me get at your hip.
- Anytime, darling.

241
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:40,166
Sir? Excuse me. I'm sorry.

242
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,878
Ow!

243
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,614
Margaret, that was fantastic.

244
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,622
Fine.

245
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,692
I hope you realize
this means we're engaged.

246
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:55,283
I hope you realize
this means we're engaged.

247
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:59,185
- Well.
- Henry. Oh, Colonel.

248
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:03,666
Well, Mr. And Mrs. 4077 th
at home, in my office.

249
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:07,101
- Should you be up?
- I'm just fine. I'm perfect.

250
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,162
You look like an ad for death.

251
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,003
You know what kind of a bird
moves into another bird's nest...

252
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,010
while the colonel bird is sick?

253
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,377
- Somebody had to take command.
- So you did it together.

254
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,508
That's double indemnity. That's
what that is. I seen it in a movie.

255
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,109
- You're burning up. Get back to bed.
- Oh, no, no, no.

256
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:26,179
So you two can just sit around my desk
and smoke my cigars?

257
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,191
- She couldn't help it. She was drunk.
- Oh, stop.

258
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,195
Well, forget it.
Just-Just get out of there, Mrs. Judas.

259
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,766
Yes, sir, I am back on the bridge.

260
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:39,701
I'm in command around here again.

261
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,145
He went down with his desk.

262
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:59,289
- Package, lady. Where do you want it?
- Right there, Doctor.

263
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,290
Pierce, I'm fine. Just fine.

264
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,223
All right, Henry,
you just go to sleep...

265
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,227
and we'll leave a call for February.

266
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,729
Same treatment he was getting
before he went over the wall.

267
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:10,858
- Right.
- Look at me, sick in Korea.

268
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,528
If I was back home
in Bloomington, Illinois,

269
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,164
my wife would be taking care of me.

270
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,731
She'd be leaning over my bed
with her hair in curlers...

271
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,745
and cold cream on her face
and those chipped fingernails.

272
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,543
The kids playing ball
up against the side of the house,

273
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:29,677
my dog at the foot of my bed
having an accident.

274
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,148
Boy, am I glad I'm here.

275
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,328
What are you doing?

276
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:42,490
Unless I've got amnesia,
this is how you dress, right?

277
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,591
You strong enough
to get back in the game?

278
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:46,602
I think I'm getting better.

279
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,400
There's two of you there.
There used to be three.

280
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:52,601
Very good.
You can do double hernias.

281
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,610
Fever gone?

282
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:57,977
Mother used to kiss
my forehead to find out.

283
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:00,983
We tried to reach your mother.
She doesn't make house calls.

284
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:04,145
You gotten any replacements?

285
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,712
We've been offered a veterinarian
and a gynecologist.

286
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,724
Great.

287
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:12,284
They'll be helpful if we get a horse
that's going through menopause.

288
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:16,492
- Been rough, huh?
- I've had more fun at autopsies.

289
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,627
Well, help is here.

290
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:22,968
Uh, Dr. Pierce,
could you look at bed five?

291
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,974
If you'll look with me.

292
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,376
No, no, now, Frank,
I don't think you should.

293
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,382
Well, Mclntyre's getting up.

294
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,284
You're sicker than he is.
Everybody knows that.

295
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:41,950
My nose feels like
it weighs five pounds.

296
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,394
Oh!

297
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:51,162
Frank, I'm in command now.

298
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:54,864
I can get a lot of things changed...
the way we want them.

299
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:58,374
Oh, that's terrific, Louise.

300
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:01,104
Louise?

301
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,779
- That's your wife.
- Where? Where?

302
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,784
Frank,

303
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:10,979
we're in Korea.

304
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:13,284
[Chuckling]
Oh. Oh, good.

305
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:15,450
She'll never find us.

306
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,427
Yes, Frank.
Yes. Lie still.

307
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,158
I'm all right.
We're gonna have to get out of here.

308
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,462
Why?

309
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,469
Too many people in this motel.

310
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,473
<i>[Thud]</i>

311
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,973
- What's up?
- It isn't Trapper.

312
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,071
I'm with you, Hawk.
I can make it.

313
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:41,515
Fine. All we have to do is move
the floor into the operating room.

314
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:46,120
Let me alone.
I can stand.

315
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,784
Sure, if we screw you to the flagpole.

316
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:51,350
Look, Trap.
You wanna help me, don't help me.

317
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:55,057
The only way you're gonna get better is
if you let yourself be sick.

318
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:58,101
I think I can manage that.

319
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:02,089
Hawkeye, chopper's on the way,
loaded with casualties.

320
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,283
Hawkeye, chopper's on the way,
loaded with casualties.

321
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,552
Fifteen minutes at the most.

322
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,130
All right, Father, get your tap shoes.

323
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:13,393
Sheila! Margaret, let's go.

324
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:16,061
- <i>Come on.</i>
- I have to go now, but I'll be back.

325
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:19,071
Good-bye, Nancy.

326
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:20,401
Nancy?

327
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:23,341
You're the best receptionist
I ever had.

328
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:29,043
- Frank!
- Honestly, Louise, we had to work late.

329
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,247
Double requisition everything.
We need whole blood.

330
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:37,256
Tap the kitchen staff
and the Korean personnel.

331
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,258
I want a pint from everybody.

332
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:41,260
I gave this morning.
Can I give again?

333
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:44,263
It's too soon.
Anyway, your blood is nearsighted.

334
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:48,233
- Is that possible?
- Keep checking for doctors.

335
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:50,202
Nobody'll listen.

336
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:53,536
Tell them you're acting under
the direct orders of General Clayton.

337
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,871
Just one moment, Captain!

338
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,104
- Radar, go.
- Stay!

339
00:19:58,178 --> 00:20:01,341
- I said go!
- And I said stay!

340
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:04,282
She outranks you.
She's got more things on her uniform.

341
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:06,751
She's got more things
in her uniform, but go.

342
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,754
Sorry, sir.

343
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:14,190
I thought we understood
that I am administration.

344
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:20,496
Let me tell you something,
administration.

345
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,558
You know that little shot
you gave me for the flu?

346
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:25,366
- Yes?
- Well, it worked. I've got it.

347
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,236
Are you sure?

348
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,607
I've got enough nausea
to light up the city ofToledo, okay?

349
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:32,612
First I'm hot, then I'm cold.

350
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,444
And my knees are in business
for themselves.

351
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,450
My tongue has gone cashmere,

352
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:40,646
and I'd like to find an all-night
latrine that takes servicemen.

353
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:43,189
Now, have I got the flu
or am I just in love?

354
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,389
- Do you think you can operate?
- I've got to.

355
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,795
What am I gonna tell the casualties,
to stop bleeding until I feel better?

356
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,924
I wanna see if you've got fever.

357
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,935
Believe me, I've got fever to burn.

358
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:58,563
I'm worried about you, Doctor.

359
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,235
You really are, aren't you?

360
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,506
You know all those rotten
things I've said to you,

361
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,604
all those nasty little tricks
I've played on you?

362
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,239
Yes.

363
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,251
I'd like to get well
and do them all over again.

364
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:18,457
Pickups.

365
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,459
Pickups.

366
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,231
How do you feel?

367
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,598
I have this terrific thirst
for embalming fluid.

368
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,603
Are you gonna make it?

369
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,605
That's up to you, Margaret.

370
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,108
You're incredible.

371
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:39,509
As sick as you are,
digging into someone's gut,

372
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,913
and you still can proposition a nurse.

373
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:46,282
I've endowed a dirty old man to make
a pass at you two years after I'm dead.

374
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:48,287
It's in my will.

375
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:52,348
- Okay. You close the skin.
- Right.

376
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,962
Sorry. How's it going, folks?

377
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,762
Bleeding's under control.
You look awful, Doctor.

378
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:03,462
I feel awful. It's a set.

379
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:06,131
Saline solution for, uh, irrigation.

380
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:09,471
Get a retractor first.
Father, pull that back, will you?

381
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:12,103
Get the saline. Pull it back more.
I can't see in there.

382
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,114
Can you get it back more?
Get some suction.

383
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:17,116
- Suction.
- All right, that's enough.

384
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:20,119
- Hawkeye? Hawk?
- Get it back a little bit more.

385
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,020
It's okay, Hawk.
I got 28 pints of blood.

386
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:28,550
You're a good man, Tiny Tim.

387
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:30,256
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

388
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,922
- You okay?
- Scrub up.

389
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,490
- Hmm?
- We need help. Kelly, get him ready.

390
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:36,832
- <i>Clamp.</i>
- Wait a minute. I can't operate.

391
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:39,930
- You're not. You're gonna help.
- How's my fainting gonna help?

392
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,237
Scrub up!

393
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:44,436
All right, we're just
about finished, Father.

394
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:47,105
- Is he all right?
- Better than I am.

395
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:49,411
Can you close or do you
want me to get you started?

396
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,951
- I can do it.
- Hawkeye, was I all right?

397
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,614
All right? I'm putting you in
for the Distinguished Cross cross.

398
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:00,985
You're making a terrible mistake.

399
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,427
<i>[Pierce] If we did nothing else,</i>
<i>we got you to wash your hands.</i>

400
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,431
Yes, sir.

401
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,901
Right this way, Doctor.

402
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:13,172
- How you doing?
- Okay.

403
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,174
I finished debreding the wound.

404
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,904
Hey. You know,
you're better than Frank.

405
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:20,071
But then so is the patient.

406
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:22,081
Radar, you'll be assisting
Margaret Houlihan...

407
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,617
nurse, friend and all-around good egg.

408
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:29,989
He's very sick.

409
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,060
Okay, gang.

410
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,021
Ours not to question why.

411
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:40,191
- Mayo scissors.
- <i>Mayo.</i>

412
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:44,432
Let me have a clamp.

413
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:46,996
- A what?
- A clamp.

414
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:49,338
- Which one is a clamp?
- There.

415
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,900
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.

416
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,573
- Okay, let me have a scalpel now.
- Which one?

417
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:57,082
- <i>[Man Over P.A.] Attention.</i>
- Be very careful.

418
00:23:57,151 --> 00:24:01,451
<i>Here is the latest news</i>

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,801
Nice going, buddy.

436
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:58,038
I'll never be able to look at this
without thinking of you, Frank.

437
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:04,112
- You were superb.
- Thanks, Chief.

438
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,345
[Radar] All right, people,
let's break it up.

439
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,412
I ordered bed rest for this patient.
