00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,212
[continues sharpening blade]

3
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,799
[indistinct shouting on TV]

4
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,926
[inaudible]

5
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,524
[overlapping chatter]

6
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,879
[baby screaming in the distance]

7
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,257
[siren wailing nearby]

8
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,469
[inaudible dialogue]

00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,150
[angry shouting]

10
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,408
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,588
Before we proceed any further,
hear me speak.

12
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,092
You are all resolved
rather to die than to famish?

13
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,595
[all] Resolved.

14
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,682
First, you know Caius Martius
is chief enemy to the people.

15
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,227
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.

16
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,940
And we'll have corn at our own price.

17
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:16,195
We are accounted poor citizens,
the patricians good.

18
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,489
The leanness that afflicts us,

19
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,952
the object of our misery,
our suffering, is a gain to them.

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,162
Aye...

21
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,333
Let us revenge this with our sticks,
ere we become rakes.

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,709
No more talking on it. Come!

23
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,545
Soft, soft, who comes here?

24
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,464
...friends, mine honest neighbors...

25
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,718
Worthy Senator Menenius,
one that has always loved the people.

26
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:45,057
l tell you, friends, most charitable
care have the patricians of you.

27
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,935
For your wants,
your suffering in this dearth,

28
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,771
you may as well strike
at the heavens with your staves

29
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,315
as lift them against the Roman state.

30
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,486
Suffer us to famish, and their
storehouses crammed with grain.

31
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,379
Bread!

32
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,677
- [man] Bread!
- [all murmur] Bread.

33
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,054
[all] Bread!

34
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,686
[crowd chanting] Bread, bread, bread...!

35
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,287
[clamoring]

36
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,625
Bread, bread, bread...

37
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,047
- [horn honking]
- [people screaming]

38
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,924
[grunting]

39
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,523
Stop!

40
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,778
- Stop! Stop!
- [shouting ceases]

41
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,206
What's the matter,
you dissentious rogues,

42
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,710
that, rubbing the poor itch of
your opinion, make yourselves scabs?

43
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,296
We have ever your good word.

44
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,052
He that will give good words to thee
will flatter beneath abhorring.

45
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,973
What would you have, you curs,
that like nor peace nor war?

46
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,310
The one affrights you,
the other makes you proud.

47
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,271
He that trusts to you,
where he should find you lions,

48
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,150
finds you hares, where foxes, geese.

49
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:48,657
Who deserves greatness,
deserves your hate.

50
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,619
Hang ye. Trust ye?

51
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,080
With every minute
you do change your mind,

52
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,416
and call him noble
that was now your hate,

53
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,709
him vile that was your garland.

54
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,963
What's the matter, that in these
several places of the city

55
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:08,176
you cry against the noble senate,
who, under the gods, keep you in awe,

56
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,179
which else would feed on one another?

57
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,434
Go.

58
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,060
Get you home...

59
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,106
...you fragments.

60
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,004
[batons rhythmically pounding shields]

61
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,549
- [man] Go back!
- [man 2] Forward!

62
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,050
[shouts]

63
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,016
- [rhythmic pounding continuing over TV]
- [man] Go back!

64
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,353
[clamoring over TV]

65
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,866
[inaudible]

66
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,235
- Please...
- Know you me yet?

67
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,571
l know you well.

68
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,659
Your name, l think, is Aufidius.

69
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,412
lt is so.

70
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,793
- l'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?

71
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,890
What's the news in Rome?

72
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,645
There hath been in Rome
strange insurrections.

73
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:29,901
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been? ls it ended then?

74
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,404
The main blaze of it is past,

75
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,407
but a small thing
would make it flame again.

76
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,243
[Aufidius on TV]
You have ended my business.

77
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,006
The news is the Volsces are in arms.

78
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,510
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius,
that'll put you to it.

79
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,472
l sin in envying his nobility.

80
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,727
And were l anything but what l am,
l would wish me only he.

81
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,061
You have fought together?

82
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,149
He is a lion that l am proud to hunt.

83
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,697
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me
once more strike at Tullus' face.

84
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,074
Lead you on.

85
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,968
So your opinion is, Aufidius,

86
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,679
that they of Rome
are entered in our counsels

87
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,390
- and know how we proceed.
- [Aufidius] ls it not yours?

88
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,226
'Tis not four days gone
since l heard thence.

89
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,272
By the discovery,
we shall be shortened in our aim.

90
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,652
And it is rumored Martius, your
old enemy, leads on this preparation.

91
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,280
lf we and Caius Martius
chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us

92
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,450
we shall ever strike
till one can do no more.

93
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,579
lf ever again l meet him beard to beard,

94
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,916
he's mine or l am his.

95
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,585
[bombs whistling]

96
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,096

00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:41,491
[grunts]

99
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,622
[man] Mark me!

100
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,834
[screams]

101
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,295
[Martius] They do disdain us much
beyond our thoughts.

102
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,174
He that retires, l'll take him for
a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!

103
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,759
Go!

104
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,471
[grunts]

105
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,183
[bullets ricochet]

106
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,970
Come on.

107
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,184
Away!

108
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,643
[rapid gunfire]

109
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,732
[grunting]

110
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,446

111
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,323
[can clanking on ground]

112
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,921
[TV plays indistinctly]

113
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,388
[man] The citizens
of Corioles have issued

114
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,516
and given to Titus
and to Martius battle.

115
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,852
We've heard their drums.
l saw our forces to their trenches

116
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,771
- driven, and then l came away...
- [TV clicks off]

117
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:42,070
l pray you, daughter, sing,

118
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,031
or express yourself
in a more comfortable sort.

119
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,994
lf my son were my husband,

120
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,415
l would more freely
rejoice in that absence

121
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,169
wherein he won honor
than in the embracements of his bed

122
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,046
where he would show most love.

123
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,676
When yet he was but tender-bodied
and the only son of my womb,

124
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:09,681
l, considering how honor
would become such a person,

125
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:15,228
was pleased to let him seek danger,
where he was like to find fame.

126
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,107
To a cruel war l sent him,

127
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,069
from whence he returned,
his brows bound with oak.

128
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,364
But had he died in the business,
madam, how then?

129
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,740
Then...

130
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,787
...his good report
should have been my son.

131
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,624
Hear me.

132
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,588
Had l a dozen sons,

133
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:47,385
l had rather eleven die
nobly for their country,

134
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,430
than one voluptuously
surfeit out of action.

135
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,974
Heavens bless my lord
from fell Aufidius.

136
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,561
He'll beat Aufidius' head
below his knee and tread upon his neck.

137
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:03,443
Methinks l hear hither
your husband's drum.

138
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:12,118
l see him stamp thus,

139
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,329
cry thus:

140
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,666
"Come on, you cowards!

141
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,754
You were got in fear,
though you were born in Rome."

142
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:32,055
You souls of geese
that bear the shapes of men!

143
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,808
Pluto and hell.
Look to it. Come on!

144
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,897
Mend and charge home,

145
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:46,361
or, by the fires of heaven, l'll leave
the foe and make my wars on you.

146
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,458
His bloody brow then wiping,
forth he goes.

147
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,086
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.

148
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,713
Away, you fool.

149
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,758
lt more becomes a man
than gold his trophy.

150
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,718
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.

151
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,929
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.

152
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,348
Beseech you,
give me leave to retire myself.

153
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:20,561
- lndeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.

154
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,693
How do you both?
And how does your little son?

155
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,319
l thank you, sir. Well, good.

156
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,655
He'd rather play
with swords and hear a drum

157
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,700
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.

158
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,493
[both chuckling]

159
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,747
Come, l must have you play the idle
housewife with me this afternoon.

160
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,666
No, good sir, l will not out of doors.

161
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,876
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.

162
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,962
lndeed, no, by your patience.

163
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,007
l'll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.

164
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,634
Fie, you confine yourself
most unreasonably.

165
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,722
- l cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.

166
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,434
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun
in Ulysses' absence

167
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,602
did but fill lthaca full of moths.

168
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,062
[chuckling]

169
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,692
No, good sir. Pardon me.
lndeed, l will not forth.

170
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,404
Go with me, and l'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.

171
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,781
No, good sir,
there can be none yet.

172
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,742
- There came news from him last night.
- [woman] lndeed?

173
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,829
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down
before the Volscian city of Carioles.

174
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,958
They nothing doubt prevailing,
and to make it brief wars.

175
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,796
This is true, on mine honor.
So, l pray, go out with us.

176
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:33,092
Give me excuse, good sir.
l will obey you in everything hereafter.

177
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,971
Let her alone. As she is now,
she will but disease our better mirth.

178
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,976
[rapid gunfire]

179
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,941
- [panting]
- [rapid gunfire]

180
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,739
[panting]

181
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,002
[grunts]

182
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,521
[breathes heavily]

183
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,665
[panting]

184
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,253
[yelling]

185
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,468
[gun fires]

186
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,053
[gun clicking]

187
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,015
[both grunting]

188
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:28,374
[yells]

189
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,173
- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.

190
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,759
He is himself alone,
to answer all the city.

191
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,931
[whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.

192
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,441
[rapid gunfire in distance]

193
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,829
Who's yonder,
that does appear as he were flayed?

194
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,334
O gods! He has the stamp of Martius.

195
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,797
Come l too late?!

196
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,592
Aye, if you come not in the blood
of others, but mantled in your own.

197
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,765
Let me hold you in arms
as sound as when l wooed,

198
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,768
in heart as merry as when
our nuptial day was done.

199
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,936
[explosion]

200
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:34,106
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.

201
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,025
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.

202
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,986
Thy exercise has been too violent
for a second course of fight.

203
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,031
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.

204
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,493
The blood l drop is more
medicinal than dangerous to me.

205
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,371
To Aufidius thus
l will appear and fight.

206
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,126
lf any such be here,
as it were sin to doubt,

207
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,879
that love this painting
wherein you see me smeared,

208
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,091
if any fear lesser his person
than an ill report,

209
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,552
if any think brave death
outweighs bad life,

210
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,930
and that his country
is dearer than himself,

211
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,892
let him alone, or so many so minded

212
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,313
wave thus, to express his disposition,
and follow Martius!

213
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,904
O... me alone.

214
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,957
Make you a sword of me!

215
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,586
[all yelling]

216
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,880
[rapid gunfire]

217
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,394
Oi!

218
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,106
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!

219
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,819
[grunts]

220
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,529
[rapid gunfire continues]

221
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,285
Away!

222
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,510
Come! Come!

223
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:03,547
l'll fight with none but thee,
for l do hate thee.

224
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,841
We hate alike.

225
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,979
[both grunting]

226
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,279
[grunts]

227
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,364
[grunts, yells]

228
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,637
[both yelling]

229
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,854
[yelling]

230
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,531
[groaning]

231
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,165
[explosion]

232
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,595
[bomb whistling]

233
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,431
[explosion]

234
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,392
[debris clattering]

235
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,897
[wind whistling]

236
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,341
[panting]

237
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,842
Five times, Martius,
l have fought with thee.

238
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,472
So often has thou beat me,
and would do so, l fear,

239
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,684
should we encounter as often as we eat.

240
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,939
For where l thought to crush him
in an equal force,

241
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,694
true sword to sword,
l'll potch at him some way.

242
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,655
Or wrath or craft may get him.

243
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,699
He's the devil.

244
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,828
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle.

245
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:11,712
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary,
being naked, sick,

246
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,798
the prayers of priests,
nor times of sacrifice

247
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,551
shall lift up their rotten
privilege and custom

248
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,054
against my hate to Martius.

249
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:27,478
Where l find him, were it at home,

250
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,648
upon my brother's guard,

251
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:36,403
even there, will l wash
my fierce hand in his heart.

252
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,366
[woman] Honorable Menenius!

253
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,161
My boy, Martius, approaches.

254
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,288
For the love of Juno, let's go.

255
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,874
ls he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.

256
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,877
O yes, he is wounded.
l thank the gods for it.

257
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,047
O, so do l too,
if it be not too much.

258
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,216
Brings a victory in his pocket,
the wounds become him.

259
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,635
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

260
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,805
Titus Lartius said they fought together,
but Aufidius got off.

261
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,182
ln truth, there's wondrous
things spoke of him.

262
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,642
Gods grant them true.

263
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,144
- True.
- l'll be sworn they're true.

264
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,396
Where is he wounded?

265
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,523
ln the shoulder and in the left arm.

266
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,608
There will be large
scars to show the people

267
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,568
when he shall stand for his place.

268
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,445
He had, before this last expedition,

269
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,157
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.

270
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,162
Every gash was an enemy's grave.

271
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:55,899
[quietly] Before him he carries noise,
and behind him he leaves tears.

272
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,697
Death, that dark spirit,
in his nervy arm doth lie.

273
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:06,410
Which, being advanced,
declines, and then men die.

274
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,290
[cameras clicking]

275
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,131
[man] Be it known,
as to us, to all the world,

276
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,759
that Caius Martius
wears this war's garland.

277
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,679
And, from this time,
for what he did before Corioles,

278
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:30,142
call him, with all the applause
and clamor of the host:

279
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:36,190
"Caius Martius Coriolanus."
Bear the addition nobly ever.

280
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,944
[all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!

281
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,572
[applause]

282
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,999
No more of this. lt does offend
my heart. Pray now, no more.

283
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,376
Look, sir, your mother.

284
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:07,054
O, you have, l know, petitioned
all the gods for my prosperity.

285
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,389
Nay, my good soldier, up.

286
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,852
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius,

287
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,608
and by deed-achieving honor
newly named... What is it?

288
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,444
"Coriolanus" must l call thee?

289
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,073
But, O, thy wife...

290
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,579
My gracious silence, hail.

291
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,585
Wouldst thou have laughed
had l come coffined home,

292
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,587
that weeps to see me triumph?

293
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,343
Aye, my dear, such eyes
the widows in Corioles wear,

294
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,888
and mothers that lack sons.

295
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,562
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?

296
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,107
l could weep and l could laugh.
l'm light and heavy.

297
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,317
- [laughter]
- l know not where to turn.

298
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,654
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.

299
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,032
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!

300
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,618
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!

301
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,453
Welcome!

302
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,636
[man] 'Tis thought that
Martius shall be consul.

303
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,513
l have seen the dumb men
throng to see him,

304
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,265
and the blind to hear him speak.

305
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,143
Matrons flung gloves,
ladies and maids their scarves

306
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,895
and handkerchiefs
upon him as he passed.

307
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,230
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.

308
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,317
And the commons made a shower
and thunder with their caps and shouts.

309
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,985
l never saw the like.

310
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,864
[man] Was ever a man
so proud as is this Martius?

311
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,490
[man 2] He has no equal.

312
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,326
When we were chosen tribunes
for the people...

313
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,787
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.

314
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,957
The augurer tells me
we shall have news tonight.

315
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,043
Good or bad?

316
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,796
Not according to the prayer of
the people, for they love not Martius.

317
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,633
Nature teaches beasts
to know their friends.

318
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,016
You blame Martius for being proud?

319
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:21,521
- We do it not alone, sir.
- l know you can do very little alone.

320
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,735
You talk of pride.

321
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,948
O that you could turn your eyes
towards the napes of your necks

322
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,742
and make but an interior
survey of your good selves.

323
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,578
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?

324
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,791
Why, then you should discover
a brace of unmeriting, proud,

325
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:46,922
violent, testy politicians,
alias fools, as any in Rome.

326
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,301
Menenius, you are known
well enough too.

327
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,471
l am known to be a humorous patrician,

328
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,433
and one that loves a cup of hot wine
with not a drop of allaying water in it.

329
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,894
One that converses more
with the buttock of the night

330
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,771
than with the forehead of the morning.

331
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:07,150
What l think l utter,
and spend my malice in my breath.

332
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,236
Come, sir, come,
we know you well enough.

333
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,782
You know neither me,
yourselves, nor anything.

334
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,622
- You're ambitious.
- [chuckles]

335
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,083
[sighs]

336
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,252
Good e'en to your worships.

337
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,588
More of your conversation
would infect my brain.

338
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,842
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say,

339
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,261
but 'tis thought of everyone
Coriolanus will carry it.

340
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,180
That's a brave fellow,
but he is vengeance proud

341
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,682
and loves not the common people.

342
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,684
There have been many great men
that have flattered the people

343
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,060
who never loved them.

344
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,022
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither
to care whether they love or hate him

345
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,983
manifests the true knowledge
he has in their disposition.

346
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,319
And, out of his noble carelessness,
lets them plainly see it.

347
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,990
But he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than they can render at him.

348
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,784
Now to seem to desire the malice
and displeasure of the people

349
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,954
is as bad as that which he dislikes,
to flatter them for their love.

350
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,206
Consider you what services
he has done for his country?

351
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,084
Very well. And would be content
to give him good report for it,

352
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,462
but that he pays
himself with being proud.

353
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,757
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.

354
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,467
[clattering]

355
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,635
[paper tearing]

356
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,774
[Martius grunts softly]

357
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,942
[sighs]

358
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,577
The good senators must be visited,

359
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,829
from whom l have received
not only greetings,

360
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,248
but with them change of honors.

361
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:53,090
l have lived to see inherited
my very wishes

362
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,343
and the buildings of my fancy.

363
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,096
Only there's one thing wanting,

364
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:05,894
which l doubt not
but our Rome will cast upon thee.

365
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:10,482
Good mother, l'd rather
be their servant in my way,

366
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,359
than sway with them in theirs.

367
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,694
[door opens]

368
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,102
Coriolanus will carry it.

369
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,938
He's a worthy man. He will carry it.

370
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,773
[bell rings]

371
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,739
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, l warrant him consul.

372
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,867
Then our office may,
during his power, go asleep.

373
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,079
He cannot temperately
transport his honors

374
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,290
from where he should begin and end,
but will lose those he hath won.

375
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,085
l heard him swear,
were he to stand for consul,

376
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,628
never would he appear
in the marketplace,

377
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,005
nor showing, as the manner is,
his wounds to the people,

378
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,007
beg their stinking breaths.

379
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,469
lt was his word. lt shall be to him
then, a sure destruction.

380
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,473
So it must fall out to him,
or our authorities, for an end.

381
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,477
We must suggest to the people

382
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,105
in what hatred
he still hath held them.

383
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,691
Kindle their dry stubble,

384
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,360
and their blaze
shall darken him forever.

385
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,406
[low, indistinct chatter]

386
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,410
[Menenius] lt remains, as the main point
of this our after-meeting,

387
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,956
to gratify his noble service
that hath thus stood for his country.

388
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,293
Therefore, please you,
most grave and reverend elders,

389
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,213
to desire the present consul, and last
general in our well-found successes,

390
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:26,219
to report a little of that worthy work
performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.

391
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,097
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [men] Aye.

392
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,395
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.

393
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,897
Never shame to hear
what you have nobly done.

394
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,984
Your honor's pardon. l'd rather
have my wounds to heal again

395
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,612
- than hear say how l got them.
- Pray you, sit down.

396
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,740
l'd rather have one
scratch my head in the sun

397
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,074
when the alarm were struck

398
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:52,370
than idly sit to hear
my nothings monstered.

399
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,624
[murmuring]

400
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,632
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [man 2] Aye, proceed.

401
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,012
The deeds of Coriolanus
should not be uttered feebly.

402
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,599
lt is held that valor
is the chiefest virtue,

403
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,351
and most dignifies the haver.

404
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,645
lf it be, the man l speak of

405
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,648
cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised.

406
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,487
[voice receding] At 1 6 years,
he fought beyond the mark of others.

407
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,031
When he might act
the woman in the scene,

408
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,950
he proved best man in the field.

409
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,370
[voice echoing]
And in the brunt of 1 7 battles since,

410
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,247
he lurched all swords of the garland.

411
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,626
For this last, before and in Corioles,

412
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,879
let me say l cannot speak him home.

413
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,466
He stopped the fliers,
and by his rare example,

414
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:51,554
made coward turn terror into sport,
from face to foot.

415
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:56,810
He was a thing of blood, whose every
motion was timed with dying cries.

416
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,814
[voice echoing] Alone, he entered
the mortal gate of the city,

417
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,149
which he painted with shunless destiny.

418
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,235
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off,

419
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,153
and with a sudden re-enforcement

420
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:11,116
struck Corioles like a planet.

421
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,160
[voice receding] Until we called
both field and city ours,

422
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,539
he never stood to ease
his breast with panting.

423
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:22,669
Our spoils he kicked at,
and looked upon things precious

424
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,088
as they were the common
muck of the world.

425
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,092
He covets less
than misery itself would give,

426
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,511
rewards his deeds with doing them,

427
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,974
and is content to spend
the time to end it.

428
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,893
[applause]

429
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,939
[indistinct salutations]

430
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,613
The senate, Coriolanus,
are well pleased to make thee consul.

431
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,407
[scattered murmurs] Aye.

432
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,748
l do owe them still
my life and services.

433
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:04,335
lt then remains
that you do speak to the people.

434
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,174
l do beseech you,
let me overleap that custom,

435
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:14,053
for l cannot entreat them for my wounds'
sake to give their suffrage.

436
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,181
Please you that l may pass this doing.

437
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,602
Sir! The people must have their voices.

438
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,353
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

439
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,064
lt is a part that l shall blush
in acting, and might well be taken

440
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,816
- from the people.
- Mark you that?

441
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,235
To brag unto them
"Thus l did, and thus!"

442
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,322
Show them the unaching scars
which l should hide,

443
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,450
as if l had received them
for the hire of their breath only.

444
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,042
To our noble consul
wish we all joy and honor!

445
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,628
[applause]

446
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,728
- [laughter]
- [applause continues over TV]

447
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,699
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are
well pleased to make thee consul!

448
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,410
[Martius] l do owe them still
my life and services.

449
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,871
[Menenius] lt then remains that
you do speak to the people.

450
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,373
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.

451
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,291
[man] The people must have their voices.

452
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,961
Have you not known
the worthiest men have done it?

453
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,504
Custom calls me to it.

454
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,966
What custom wills,
in all things should we do it.

455
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,592
What must l say?

456
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,554
"Look, sir, my wounds.
l got them in my country's service."

457
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,890
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.

458
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,475
You must desire them to think upon you.

459
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,769
Think upon me?

460
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,105
Hang 'em.
l would they would forget me.

461
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,441
[siren chirping]

462
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,667
Pray you, speak to them.

463
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,253
l pray you, in wholesome manner.

464
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,381
Bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean.

465
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,685
[helicopter passing overhead]

466
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,168
You know the cause, sir,
of my standing here?

467
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,129
We do, sir. Tell us
what hath brought you to it.

468
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,341
- Mine own desert.
- [woman] Your own desert?

469
00:43:56,508 --> 00:44:01,304
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?

470
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,932
No, it was never my desire
yet to trouble the poor with begging.

471
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,603
You must think, if we give you anything,
we hope to gain by you.

472
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,690
Well then, l pray,
your price of the consulship?

473
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,569
The price is to ask it kindly.

474
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,781
Kindly, sir, l pray, let me have it.

475
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,745
l have wounds to show you,
which shall be yours in private.

476
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,748
Your good voice, sir. What say you?

477
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,837
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.

478
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,924
There's in all two
worthy voices begged. Adieu.

479
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,302
But this is something odd.

480
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,432
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand
with the tune of your voice

481
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,726
that l may be consul.

482
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,271
You've deserved nobly of your country,
and you've not deserved nobly.

483
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,231
[chuckles]

484
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,899
Your enigma?

485
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,986
You've been a scourge to her enemies,
you've been a rod to her friends.

486
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,447
You've not indeed loved
the common people.

487
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:06,077
You should account me the more virtuous
that l have not been common in my love.

488
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,287
We hope to find you our friend,

489
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,581
and therefore give you
our voices heartily.

490
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,668
l'll make much of your voices,
and so trouble you no further.

491
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,879
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.

492
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,190
Your voices!

493
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,196
For your voices l have fought.

494
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,243
Watched for your voices.

495
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,707
For your voices
bear of wounds two dozen odd.

496
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:59,088
Battles thrice six
l have seen and heard of!

497
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:05,762
For your voices have done many things,
some less, some more.

498
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,974
Your voices!

499
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:16,689
lndeed, l would be consul.

500
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:27,283
He has done nobly, and cannot go
without any honest man's voice!

501
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,994
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.

502
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,915
Therefore, let him be consul!

503
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,876
- Amen!
- Amen!

504
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,545
[others join in] Amen!

505
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,344
Amen!

506
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,180
[chanting]

507
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,851
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]

508
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,563
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]

509
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,191
Worthy voices, worthy voices.

510
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,569
[chanting, cheering]

511
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,826
[Menenius] You have
stood your limitation.

512
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,539
And the tribunes now endow you
with the people's voice.

513
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,290
ls this done?

514
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,085
The custom of request
you have discharged.

515
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,795
The people do admit you,

516
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,381
and are summoned to meet anon
upon your approbation.

517
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,424
- Where? At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.

518
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,469
- May l change these garments?
- You may, sir.

519
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,518
l'll keep you company. Will you along?

520
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,145
We stay here for the people.

521
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,899
[man] God save thee, noble consul!

522
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:48,364
[crowd chanting] Consul! Consul!
Consul! Consul! Consul! Consul!

523
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,579
How now, my masters!

524
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

525
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:03,379
Whoa, my masters! My masters!
My masters, how now!

526
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,258
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!

527
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,968
He has our voices, sir.

528
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,470
We pray the gods
he may deserve your loves.

529
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,805
[woman] Amen, sir.

530
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:17,643
To my poor, unworthy notice,
he mocked us when he begged our voices.

531
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,146
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.

532
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,983
O, no, no, no,
it is his kind of speech.

533
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,943
- [scattered voices] Aye.
- He did not mock us.

534
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,446
He should have showed us
his marks of merit,

535
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,449
- wounds received for his country.
- [several shouting] Yes!

536
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,535
- Why, l'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!

537
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,831
No, no, no! No! No!
No one saw them!

538
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,172
Was this mockery?

539
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,758
[scattered voices] Yes!

540
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,975
When he had no power, but was a petty
servant to the state, he was your enemy.

541
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,812
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties.

542
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,066
Did you perceive he did solicit
you in free contempt

543
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,528
when he did need your loves,
and do you think that his contempt

544
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,573
shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush?

545
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,409
[scattered voices] Aye!

546
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,329
lt is not confirmed.

547
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,874
lt is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!

548
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,585
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!

549
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,838
l'll have 500 voices of that sound.

550
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:32,176
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- l twice 500 and their friends!

551
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,053
[crowd] Yes!

552
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,056
Get you hence instantly
and tell those friends

553
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,434
they have chose a consul that will
from them take their liberties!

554
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,728
Let them assemble,
and on a safer judgment,

555
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,647
all revoke your ignorant election.

556
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,483
Enforce his pride,
and his old hate unto you!

557
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,195
And, presently, when you have drawn
the number, repair to the senate.

558
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,739
[low, indistinct chatter]

559
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,578
Tullus Aufidius then
has assembled a new army?

560
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,705
He has, my lord.

561
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,999
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.

562
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,918
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.

563
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,461
How? What?

564
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,922
How often he had met you,
sword to sword.

565
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,342
That of all things upon the earth,
he hated your person most.

566
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,429
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.

567
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,807
l wish l had a cause to seek him there,
to oppose his hatred fully.

568
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,768
Come, Rome must know
the value of her own.

569
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,813
[low, indistinct chatter]

570
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,947
Behold, these are the tribunes
of the people,

571
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,741
the tongues of the common mouth.

572
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,368
- Pass no further.
- Ah? What is that?

573
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,370
lt will be dangerous to go on.
No further.

574
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,289
- What makes this change?
- The matter?

575
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,125
Hath he not passed
the nobles and the commons?

576
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,586
- Cominius, no.
- Have l had children's voices?

577
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,505
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.

578
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,967
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm.

579
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,679
The people cry you mocked them,
and of late called them time-pleasers,

580
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,724
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.

581
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,101
You show too much of that
for which the people stir.

582
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,561
lf you will pass to where you are bound,

583
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,730
you must inquire your way
with a gentler spirit.

584
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,400
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.

585
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,152
This was my speech,
and l'll speak it again.

586
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,989
- Not now, not now.
- [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir.

587
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,034
My nobler friends,
l crave their pardons.

588
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,205
For the mutable, rank-scented many,
let them regard me as l do not flatter,

589
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,123
and therein behold themselves.

590
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:30,836
l say again, in soothing them,
we nourish against our senate

591
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,798
the cockle of rebellion,
insolence, sedition,

592
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,093
which we ourselves have ploughed for,
sowed, and scattered

593
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,178
by mingling them with us,

594
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,139
the honored number
who lack not virtue, no, nor power,

595
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,766
but that which we have given to beggars!

596
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,519
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.

597
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,396
You speak of the people
as if you were a god to punish,

598
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,981
not a man of their infirmity.

599
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,358
lt were well we let the people know it.

600
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,236
Were l as patient as the midnight sleep,
by Jove, it would be my mind!

601
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:59,240
lt is a mind that shall remain a poison
where it is, not poison any further.

602
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,243
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?

603
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,620
Mark you his absolute "shall"?

604
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,705
Why should the people give one
that speaks thus their voice?

605
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,876
l'll give my reasons,
more worthier than their voices!

606
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:17,007
By Jove himself,
it makes the consuls base,

607
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,635
and my soul aches to know,

608
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,514
when two authorities are up,
neither supreme,

609
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,517
how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both

610
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,227
and take the one by the other.

611
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,105
Thus we debase
the nature of our seats

612
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,984
and make the rabble call our cares
fears, which will, in time,

613
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,944
break open the locks of the senate,

614
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,446
and bring in the crows
to peck the eagles!

615
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,991
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.

616
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,411
He has spoken like a traitor,
and shall answer as traitors do!

617
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,830
Thou wretch,
despite overwhelm thee!

618
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,875
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul? No!

619
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,626
Seize him!

620
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,212
Hence, old goat!

621
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,381
[crowd shouting]

622
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,094
On both sides more respect!

623
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,891
- [crowd booing]
- [yelling]

624
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,601
Shh! Shh!

625
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:13,397
Here's he that would
take from you all your power!

626
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,443
You are at point to lose your liberties!

627
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,321
Martius would have all from you,

628
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:24,116
Martius, whom late
you have named for consul.

629
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,952
[angry shouting]

630
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,998
- What is the city but the people?!
- [woman] True!

631
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:35,836
The people are the city!
The people are the city!

632
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:39,465
[clamoring]

633
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,511
We do here pronounce,
upon the part of the people,

634
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,890
Martius is worthy of present death!

635
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,517
[clamoring]

636
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,145
Death!

637
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:58,108
- Guards, seize him!
- No, l'll die here!

638
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,902
[clamoring continuing]

639
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,075
Get you to your house! Be gone, away!

640
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,870
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!

641
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,580
[clamoring continues]

642
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,820
[sirens wailing nearby]

643
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,217
[clears throat]

644
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,016
[sighs]

645
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:21,317
As l do know the consul's worthiness,
so can l name his faults.

646
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,235
Consul? What consul?

647
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,196
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- [scoffs] He, consul?

648
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,991
lt is decreed he dies tonight.

649
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,327
He's a disease that must be cut away.

650
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,413
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.

651
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,709
Mortal, to cut it off,
to cure it, easy.

652
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,339
What has he done to Rome
that's worth his death, eh?

653
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,427
Killing our enemies?

654
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,764
[sighs]

655
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:56,018
The blood he hath lost,
he dropped it for his country.

656
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,270
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...

657
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,898
Consider this:

658
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:05,027
He's been bred in the wars
since he could draw a sword,

659
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,696
and is ill-schooled
in graceful language.

660
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:13,243
Give me leave. l'll go to him
and undertake to bring him

661
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:18,248
where he shall answer
by a lawful form, in peace,

662
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,583
to his utmost peril.

663
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,544
Noble tribunes,
it is the humane way.

664
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,714
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.

665
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,179
ln you bring not Martius,
we'll proceed in our first way.

666
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,850
l'll bring him to you.

667
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,730
Let them pull all about mine ears,

668
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,691
present me death on the wheel
or at wild horses' heels,

669
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,985
- yet will l still be thus to them!
- Martius...

670
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,114
l muse my mother
does not approve me further.

671
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,450
l talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?

672
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,245
Would you have me false to my nature?

673
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,624
Rather say l play the man l am.

674
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:12,302
Sir, sir, l would have had
you put your power well on

675
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,304
before you had worn it out.

676
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,973
- Let go.
- You might have been enough

677
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,892
the man you are,
with striving less to be so.

678
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,937
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.

679
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,314
Come, come, you've been
too rough, something too rough.

680
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,233
You must return and mend it.

681
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,403
There's no remedy, unless,
by not so doing, our good city

682
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,738
cleave in the midst and perish.

683
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,409
Pray, be counseled.

684
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,954
l have a heart as little apt as yours,

685
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:44,001
but yet a brain that leads
my use of anger to better vantage.

686
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,128
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must l do?

687
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,464
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then? What then?

688
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,176
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them? l cannot do it to the gods.

689
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,719
Must l then do it to them?

690
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,350
You are too absolute.

691
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:07,316
l've heard you say
that honor and policy,

692
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,818
like unsevered friends in war,
do grow together.

693
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,362
Why force you this?

694
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,533
Because that now it lies
you on to speak to the people,

695
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,827
not by your own instruction,

696
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,371
nor by the matter
your heart prompts you,

697
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,626
but with such words that
are but roted in your tongue,

698
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:31,256
though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosom's truth.

699
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,136
l would dissemble
with my nature where my fortune

700
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:41,683
and my friends at stake required
l should do so in honor.

701
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:47,356
l am, in this, your wife,
your son, the senators,

702
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:52,236
nobles... and you.

703
00:58:54,864 --> 00:59:00,702
l prithee now, my son,
go to them, be with them,

704
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:06,625
say to them thou art their soldier.

705
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,169
And being bred in broils

706
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:14,132
has not the soft way
in asking their good loves.

707
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:19,555
But thou wilt frame thyself,

708
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,099
forsooth, hereafter theirs.

709
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:28,855
This but done, even as she speaks,
why their hearts were yours.

710
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,233
l prithee, go and be ruled.

711
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:36,405
Sir, it is fit you make strong party,

712
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,157
or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence.

713
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,411
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.

714
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,581
l think it will serve
if he can thereto frame his spirit.

715
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,709
He must.

716
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,129
He will.

717
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,465
Prithee now, say you will,
and go about it.

718
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:59,595
Must l, with base tongue,
give my noble heart

719
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,431
a lie that it must bear?

720
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,226
Well, l'll do it.

721
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:12,899
Away, my disposition,
and possess me some harlot's spirit.

722
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:17,237
A beggar's tongue
make motion through my lips.

723
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,616
l will not do it.

724
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,619
Lest l cease to honor mine own truth,

725
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,247
and by my body's action teach
my mind a most inherent baseness.

726
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,167
At thy choice, then.

727
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,961
To beg of thee is more
my dishonor than thou of them.

728
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,630
Come all to ruin.

729
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,676
Let thy mother rather
feel thy pride than fear

730
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,013
thy dangerous stoutness,
for l mock at death

731
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:47,517
with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.

732
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:00,947
Thy valiantness was mine,
thou suck'st it from me,

733
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,325
but owe thy pride thyself.

734
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,536
Pray, be content, Mother, l'm going.

735
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:13,043
Chide me no more. Look, l am going.

736
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,384
l'll return consul, or never
trust to what my tongue can do

737
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:24,596
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.

738
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,684
ln this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.

739
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,521
lf he evade us there, enforce him
with his hatred to the people.

740
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,189
Have you a catalog of all the voices

741
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,982
that we have procured
set down by the poll?

742
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,901
l have. lt's ready.

743
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,194
When the people hear me say

744
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,196
"lt shall be so in the right
and strength of the commons,"

745
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,490
be it either for death, for fine,
or banishment,

746
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,326
then, let them, if they hear me say
"Fine," cry "Fine."

747
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,829
- lf "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.

748
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,834
- [man] God preserve thee.
- [light applause]

749
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,803
[indistinct chatter]

750
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,230
- [whistles]
- [jeering]

751
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,482
[loud jeer]

752
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,154
[shrill whistle]

753
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,534
The people are the city.

754
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,870
Put not your worthy rage
into your tongue.

755
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,997
Calmly, l beseech you.

756
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,292
[jeering subsides]

757
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,220
[clears throat]

758
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,896
- The honored gods...
- [microphone whines]

759
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,439
[crowd laughing]

760
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,782
[clears throat]

761
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,951
The honored gods
keep Rome in safety,

762
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,747
and the chairs ofjustice
supplied with worthy men,

763
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:17,125
plant love among us,

764
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,961
throng our large temples
with the shows of peace,

765
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,088
and not our streets with war.

766
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,758
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.

767
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,261
Shall l be charged
no further than this present?

768
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,222
Must all determine here?

769
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:34,267
l do demand, if you submit
you to the people's voices.

770
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,977
[scattered voices] Aye.

771
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:40,440
- l am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.

772
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,403
The warlike service
he has done, consider.

773
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,405
Think upon the wounds his body bears,

774
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:50,325
which show like graves
in the holy churchyard.

775
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,370
Scratches with briers,
scars to move laughter only.

776
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:57,666
Consider further, that when
he speaks not like a citizen,

777
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,210
- you find him like a soldier.
- [inaudible murmurs]

778
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:04,464
Do not take his rougher accents
for malicious sounds, but, as l say,

779
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,176
such as become a soldier.

780
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:12,806
What is the matter that being
passed for consul with full voice,

781
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,726
l am so dishonored that the very hour
you take it off again?

782
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:20,772
We charge you that you have contrived
to take from Rome all seasoned office,

783
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,984
and to wind yourself
into a power tyrannical,

784
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,402
for which you are
a traitor to the people.

785
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,945
How... traitor?

786
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,197
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately. Your promise.

787
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,867
The fires in the lowest hell
fold in the people.

788
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,786
Call me their traitor,
thou injurious tribune?

789
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,122
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.

790
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,790
- [angry shouts]
- [man] Traitor!

791
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,878
But since he hath
served well for Rome...

792
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,546
What do you prate of service?

793
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,923
- l talk of that, that know it.
- You?

794
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,717
ls this the promise
you made your mother?

795
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,846
l'll know no further. Let them
pronounce death, exile, flaying,

796
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:56,641
l would not buy their mercy
at the price of one fair word.

797
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,936
ln the name of the people,
and in the power of us, the tribunes,

798
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:03,231
we, even from this instant,
banish him our city.

799
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:07,569
ln the people's name, l say...
it shall be so.

800
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:13,158
- lt shall be so!
- He's banished. lt shall be so!

801
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,870
- [crowd shouting]
- lt shall be so!

802
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,665
- [chanting] lt shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters,

803
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,000
and my common friends...

804
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,794
- He's sentenced. No more hearing.
- [Cominius] Let me speak.

805
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,505
- [overlapping] lt shall be so!
- l have been consul

806
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,301
and can show for Rome
her enemies' marks upon me...

807
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,013
There is no more to be said,
but he is banished as enemy

808
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,223
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] lt shall be so!

809
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,060
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!

810
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:43,146
[chanting] lt shall be so!
lt shall be so!

811
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,732
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!

812
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,318
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!

813
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:53,239
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!

814
01:05:53,407 --> 01:06:02,874
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!

815
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:08,880
You common cry of curs!

816
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:14,886
Whose breath l hate
as reeks of the rotten fens,

817
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:19,474
whose loves l prize
as the dead carcasses

818
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:24,062
of unburied men
that do corrupt my air.

819
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,440
l... banish... you!

820
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:32,988
And here remain with your uncertainty.

821
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,742
Let every feeble rumor
shake your hearts.

822
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,745
Your enemies,
with nodding of their caps,

823
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,790
fan you into despair.

824
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:49,421
Have the power still to banish
your defenders, till at length

825
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:54,009


826
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,012
making but reservation of yourselves,

827
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:01,433
still your own foes deliver you

828
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,186
as most abated captives to some nation

829
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:09,065
that won you without blows.

830
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:18,783
Despising, for you, the city...

831
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,870
...thus...

832
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,081
...l turn my back.

833
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:32,338
There is a world... elsewhere.

834
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,935
The people's enemy is gone!

835
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,648
- [applause]
- [cheering]

836
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:04,329
- [laughter]
- Whoo!

837
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,846
[cheering]

838
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,977
[children chattering nearby]

839
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,525
[dogs barking]

840
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:44,244
[indistinct chatter]

841
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:21,823
[Martius] Nay, Mother,
where is your ancient courage?

842
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:26,077
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]

843
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,039
[Martius] Nay, Mother,
l shall be loved when l am lacked.

844
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,545
l go alone, like to a lonely dragon.

845
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:52,455
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.

846
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,998
The gods keep you.

847
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,875
This is a happier
and more comely time.

848
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,586
- Yeah.
- Good day. Good day.

849
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,758
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.

850
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,971
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.

851
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,809
The hoarded plague of the gods
requite thy love.

852
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,354
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!

853
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,982
l would l had the power
to say so to my husband.

854
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:22,318
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?

855
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:27,073
l tell thee what, fool,
hadst thou craft to banish him

856
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,868
that struck more blows for Rome
than thou hast spoken words?

857
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,453
[gasping] Blessed heavens...

858
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:36,791
More noble blows
than ever thou wise words,

859
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:41,254
and for Rome's good. Yet go.

860
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:45,091
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.

861
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,051
l tell thee what.

862
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:52,223
l would my son were in Arabia,
and thy tribe before him,

863
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,101
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?

864
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:58,855
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!

865
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:02,233
- Bastards and all.
- Come! Come, peace!

866
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,776
Well, well, we'll leave you.

867
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:08,031
Why stay we to be baited
by one who wants her wits?

868
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:15,371
l would the gods
had nothing else to do

869
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:19,375
but to confirm my curses!

870
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:27,717
Could l meet them but once a day,

871
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:32,263
it would unclog my heart
of what lies heavy to it.

872
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,101
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.

873
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,105
You'll sup with me?

874
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,441
Anger's my meat.

875
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,320
l sup upon myself...

876
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,616
...and so shall starve with feeding.

877
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,205
- Come.
- Come, madam.

878
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:40,164
[hoofbeats approaching]

879
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,486
[indistinct chatter]

880
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,363
[up-tempo music plays nearby]

881
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,219
Hey.

882
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,359
[men calling out] Aufidius!

883
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,448
Ah, general.

884
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,455
Yes.

885
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,462
Well, well.

886
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,972
[bell tolling]

887
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,831
[soldiers chattering, muffled]

888
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,472
- [door opens]
- [man] Hey, hey!

889
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,142
- [grunting]
- [weapons cocking]

890
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,578
Whence comes thou?

891
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,127
Thy name?

892
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:18,549
Speak, man.
What's thy name?

893
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:21,636
A name unmusical
to the Volscians' ears,

894
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,679
and harsh in sound to thine.

895
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:28,017
Say... what's thy name?

896
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,647
Thou has a grim appearance.

897
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,524
What's thy name?

898
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:41,822
- Know'st thou me yet?
- l know thee not.

899
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,284
Thy name?

900
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:49,622
My name is Caius Martius...

901
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,460
...who hath done to thee, particularly,

902
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:59,590
and to all the Volsces
great hurt and mischief.

903
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,468
Thereto witness may my surname...

904
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,471
...Coriolanus.

905
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,810
Only that name remains.

906
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:13,729
The cruelty and envy of the people

907
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:17,441
who have all forsook me
hath devoured the rest,

908
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:22,363
and suffered me by the voice of slaves
to be whooped out of Rome.

909
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,283
Now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth,

910
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,787
not out of hope,
mistake me not, to save my life,

911
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:33,332
for if l had feared death,
of all men in the world

912
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,584
l would have avoided thee.

913
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:40,297
But, in mere spite, to be full quit
of those, my banishers,

914
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:43,175
stand l before thee here.

915
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:48,222
l will fight against my cankered country

916
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,267
with the spleen of all the under fiends.

917
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:57,106
But if thou dares not this,

918
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:01,277
then l present my throat to thee
and to thy ancient malice,

919
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:05,614
which not to cut would
show thee but a fool,

920
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,701
since l have ever
followed thee with hate,

921
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:12,705
and cannot live but to thy shame

922
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,041
unless it be to do thee service.

923
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,179
[breathing heavily]

924
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,900
O Martius...

925
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,402
Martius...

926
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,531
Each word thou hast spoke

927
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,952
hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy.

928
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:02,880
Let me twine mine arms about that body.

929
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,640
Know thou...

930
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:18,854
...l loved the maid l married,
never man sighed truer breath.

931
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:25,694
But that l see thee here,
thou noble thing...

932
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,033
...more dances my rapt heart

933
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,285
than when l first
my wedded mistress saw

934
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:34,995
bestride my threshold.

935
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:42,920
Why, thou Mars, l tell thee,
thou hast beat me out 1 2 several times,

936
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:49,051
and l have nightly since dreamt
of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.

937
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:56,475
Worthy Martius,
had we no quarrel else to Rome,

938
01:20:56,643 --> 01:21:01,146
but that thou art thence banished,
we would muster all from 1 2 to 70,

939
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:03,941
and, pouring war into
the bowels of ungrateful Rome,

940
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:07,027
like a bold flood, overbear it.

941
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:26,755
[snipping]

942
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,427
[buzzing]

943
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:02,374
Come, go in, and take our
friendly senators by the hands.

944
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,253
You bless me, gods.

945
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:36,825
Therefore, most absolute sir...

946
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:41,205
...if thou wilt have the leading
of thine own revenges,

947
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,124
take the one half of my commission.

948
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:50,506
And set down
as best thou art experienced,

949
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,550
since thou knows thy country's
strength and weakness,

950
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:57,763
thine own ways, whether to knock
against the gates of Rome,

951
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:03,227
or rudely visit them in parts
remote to fright them, ere destroy.

952
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:15,114
[indistinct chatter]

953
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,203
- [man] ls this Menenius?
- [man 2] O, 'tis he, 'tis he.

954
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,038
O, he's grown most kind of late.

955
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:25,749
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.

956
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:28,669
Your Coriolanus is not much missed,
but with his friends.

957
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:31,922
All's well, and might
have been much better

958
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:35,509
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?

959
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,219
l hear nothing.

960
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,513
His mother and his wife
hear nothing from him.

961
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,974
Caius Martius was
a worthy officer in the war,

962
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:44,518
but insolent, overcome with pride,

963
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,395
ambitious past all thinking,
self-loving...

964
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,230
l think not so.

965
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,733
And Rome sits safe
and still without him.

966
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,110
- Shh!
- Shh!

967
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:57,114
[fanfare plays]

968
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:00,492
There are reports the Volsces,
with two several powers,

969
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:03,120
are entered in the Roman territories,

970
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:07,583
and with the deepest malice of the war,
destroy what lies before them.

971
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,252
- [patrons] Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius,

972
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,004
who, hearing of our Martius' banishment,

973
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:15,090
thrusts forth his horns
into the world again. [chuckles]

974
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:16,508
Come, what talk you of Martius?

975
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,635
lt cannot be the Volsces
dare break with us.

976
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:22,973
Cannot be? We have record that it can.

977
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,143
[man] The nobles in great earnestness
are going all to the Senate House.

978
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:30,022
Some news is coming
that turns their countenances.

979
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:32,691
Yes, the first report
is seconded, and more...

980
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:35,110
...more fearful is delivered.

981
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,781
Martius has joined with Aufidius.

982
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:41,033
He leads a power against Rome,

983
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:44,620
and vows revenge
as spacious as between

984
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:47,206
the youngest and oldest thing.

985
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,628
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius,

986
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:56,757
associated with Aufidius,
rages upon our territories,

987
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:58,801
and have already overborne their way,

988
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:01,512
consumed with fire,
and took what lay before them.

989
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:04,306
Martius has joined with the Volscians.

990
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:07,142
He is their god.
He leads them like boys

991
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:10,479
pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies.

992
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,316
[men cheering]

993
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,242
[laughter]

994
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:25,786
[rock music playing]

995
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,058
- [clippers buzzing]
- [men cheering]

996
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:05,450
Do they still fly to the Roman?

997
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,619
[man] l do not know
what witchcraft's in him,

998
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:11,290
but your soldiers use him
as the grace before meat,

999
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:14,418
their talk at table,
and their thanks at end.

1000
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,920
And you are darkened
in this action, sir.

1001
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:23,927
He bears himself more proud,
even to my person,

1002
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:27,764
than l thought he would
when first l did embrace him.

1003
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:32,352
Sir, l beseech you,
think you he'll carry Rome?

1004
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:39,151
l think he'll be to Rome
as is the osprey to the fish,

1005
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:42,404
who takes it by sovereignty of nature.

1006
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,710
[cheering]

1007
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:09,681
[rock music continuing]

1008
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:46,343
Whether it was pride,
whether defect ofjudgment...

1009
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:52,099
...or whether nature,
not to be other than one thing,

1010
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,396
made him feared,
so hated, and so banished...

1011
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:04,027
...so our virtues lie
in the interpretation of the time.

1012
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:09,074
One fire drives out one fire...

1013
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,911
...one nail, one nail.

1014
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:21,211
Rights by rights falter,
strengths by strengths do fail.

1015
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:29,344
When, Caius,

1016
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:34,182
Rome is thine,
thou art poorest of all...

1017
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:40,939
...then shortly art thou mine.

1018
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:43,817
No, l'll not go.

1019
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,029
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.

1020
01:28:47,196 --> 01:28:52,284
A mile before his tent, fall down,
and kneel the way into his mercy.

1021
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,244
[door opens]

1022
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:18,935
He would not seem to know me.

1023
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:24,191
l urged our old acquaintance,
and the drops

1024
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,485
that we have bled together.

1025
01:29:26,652 --> 01:29:32,532
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to,
forbad all names.

1026
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,702
He was...

1027
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,333
...a kind of nothing.

1028
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,882
Titleless.

1029
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:55,472
Till he had forged himself a name
in the fire of burning Rome.

1030
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,227
lf you refuse your aid in this...

1031
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,979
lf you would be your country's pleader,
your good tongue,

1032
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:06,316
more than the instant army we can make,
might stop our countryman.

1033
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,902
- No, l'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.

1034
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,656
- What should l do?
- Only make trial what your love can do

1035
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,199
for Rome towards Martius.

1036
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:20,205
Well, and say "Martius return me,
as Titus is returned, unhurt."

1037
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:21,331
What then?

1038
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,251
Yet your good will must have
that thanks from Rome.

1039
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:28,672
You know the very road into his
kindness, and cannot lose your way.

1040
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,516
l'll undertake it.

1041
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,399
l think he'll hear me.

1042
01:30:56,576 --> 01:31:00,036
- He'll never hear him.
- No?

1043
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:03,206
l tell you, he does sit in gold...

1044
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:08,378
...his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.

1045
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:44,975
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod
about thy particular prosperity...

1046
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:50,939
...and love thee no worse
than thy old friend Menenius does.

1047
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:58,238
O Martius, Martius.

1048
01:32:59,782 --> 01:33:01,825
Thou art preparing fire for us.

1049
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:04,953
Look thee...

1050
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,998
...there's water to quench it.

1051
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:12,377
l was hardly moved to come to thee,

1052
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:15,005
but being assured none
but myself could move thee,

1053
01:33:15,172 --> 01:33:20,260
l have been blown out
of your gates with sighs...

1054
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:26,558
...and conjure thee to pardon Rome.

1055
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:33,398
Away.

1056
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,444
How? Away?

1057
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,906
Wife... mother... child... l know not.

1058
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,659
My affairs are servanted to others.

1059
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:47,245
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.

1060
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,127
Another word, Menenius,
l will not hear thee speak.

1061
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:41,216
This Martius is grown
from man to dragon.

1062
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:43,677
He has wings.

1063
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,306
He's more than a creeping thing.

1064
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:57,899
[engines starting]

1065
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:08,910
There is no more mercy in him
than there is milk in a male tiger.

1066
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:18,461
[car driving away]

1067
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,327
[coughs]

1068
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:11,347
[breathes heavily]

1069
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:29,801
[helicopters whirring]

1070
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:41,396
[wolf whistle]

1071
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,072
My lord and husband.

1072
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:36,868
These eyes are not the same
l wore in Rome.

1073
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:40,163
The sorrow that delivers us
thus changed makes you think so.

1074
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:45,668
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny,

1075
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:49,464
but do not say for that
"Forgive our Romans."

1076
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,480
O, a kiss...

1077
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,776
...long as my exile...

1078
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:17,617
...sweet as my revenge.

1079
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:24,290
Ye gods, l prate,

1080
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:27,835
and the most noble mother
of the world leave unsaluted.

1081
01:39:28,003 --> 01:39:30,004
Sink, my knee, in the earth.

1082
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:32,590
Stand up, blest.

1083
01:39:34,009 --> 01:39:36,928
Whilst with no softer
cushion than the flint

1084
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:40,056
- l kneel before thee.
- What's this?

1085
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,725
Your knees to me?

1086
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:44,519
To your corrected son?

1087
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:48,189
Thou art my warrior.
l helped to frame thee.

1088
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:51,025
This is a poor epitome of yours,

1089
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:54,904
which by the interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself.

1090
01:40:03,872 --> 01:40:08,501
The god of soldiers,
inform thy thoughts with nobleness,

1091
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,379
that thou may'st prove
to shame, invulnerable.

1092
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,298
Your knee, sir.

1093
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:20,346
Even he, your wife,
this lady and myself,

1094
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:22,473
- are suitors to you.
- l beseech you, peace.

1095
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,393
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:

1096
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:27,979
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers,

1097
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:31,107
or capitulate again
with Rome's mechanics.

1098
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,401
Tell me not wherein l seem unnatural.

1099
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:38,031
Desire not to allay my rages
and revenges with your colder reasons.

1100
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:42,285
No more, no more.

1101
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:45,997
You have said you
will not grant us anything,

1102
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:49,125
for we have nothing else to ask
but that which you deny already.

1103
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,837
Yet we will ask,
that if you fail in our request,

1104
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:56,007
the blame may hang upon
your hardness. Therefore hear us.

1105
01:40:56,675 --> 01:40:58,426
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.

1106
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:01,137
For we'll hear naught
from Rome in private.

1107
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:11,314
Your request?

1108
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:43,596
Should we be silent
and not speak, our raiment

1109
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:48,142
and state of bodies would betray
what life we have led since thy exile.

1110
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,815
Think with thyself.

1111
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:59,946
How more unfortunate than all
living women are we come hither,

1112
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:05,326
since that thy sight, which should
make our eyes flow with joy,

1113
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:08,955
hearts dance with comforts...

1114
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:15,586
...constrains them weep
and shake with fear and sorrow...

1115
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:19,674
...making the mother, wife, and child

1116
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:24,011
to see the son,
the husband and the father

1117
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:26,430
tearing his country's bowels out.

1118
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:30,810
And we must find an evident calamity,

1119
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,938
though we had our wish,
which side should win.

1120
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:39,026
For either thou must,
as a foreign recreant,

1121
01:42:39,194 --> 01:42:43,030
be led with manacles
through our streets,

1122
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,410
or else, triumphantly,
tread on thy country's ruin,

1123
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:50,454
and bear the palm
for having bravely shed

1124
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:52,832
thy wife and children's blood.

1125
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:03,759
For myself... son...

1126
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:09,640
...l purpose not to wait on fortune
till these wars determine.

1127
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:12,560
lf l cannot persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace

1128
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,687
to both parts than seek the end to one,

1129
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:18,691
thou shalt no sooner march
to assault thy country

1130
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,527
than to tread on thy mother's womb...

1131
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:24,697
...that brought thee to this world.

1132
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:28,075
Aye, and mine,
that brought you forth this boy

1133
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:29,994
to keep your name living to time.

1134
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:35,249
You shall not tread on me.

1135
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:38,252
l'll run away till l'm bigger...

1136
01:43:39,838 --> 01:43:41,464
...but then l'll fight!

1137
01:43:43,425 --> 01:43:47,470
- l have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.

1138
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:53,184
lf it were so that our request
did tend to save the Romans,

1139
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:56,312
thereby to destroy
the Volsces whom you serve,

1140
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:01,651
thou might'st condemn us
as poisonous of your honor.

1141
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:06,072
No. Our suit is that
you reconcile them.

1142
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,034
So that the Volces may say
"This mercy we have showed,"

1143
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:12,245
the Romans, "This we've received,"

1144
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:17,291
and each on either side
give the all-hail to thee and cry,

1145
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:19,252
"Be blest for making up this peace!"

1146
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:28,386
Speak to me, son.

1147
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:33,641
Why dost not speak?

1148
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,816
Speak you, daughter.

1149
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,193
He cares not for your weeping.

1150
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:45,444
Speak thou, boy.

1151
01:44:46,321 --> 01:44:50,074
Perhaps thy childishness will
move him more than can our reasons.

1152
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:52,743
There's no man in the world
more bound to his mother,

1153
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:55,621
yet here he lets me prate
like one in the stocks!

1154
01:44:55,789 --> 01:45:01,627
Thou hast never, in thy life,
shown thy dear mother any courtesy,

1155
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:05,673
when she, poor hen,
has clucked thee to the wars

1156
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,718
and safely home loaded with honor.

1157
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:13,055
Say my request's unjust and
spurn me back, but if it be not so...

1158
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:20,563
...thou art not honest
and the gods will plague thee,

1159
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:25,234
that thou restrains from me the duty
which to a mother's part belongs.

1160
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:32,366
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!

1161
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,621
Down!

1162
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:41,292
This is the last.

1163
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,837
An end.

1164
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:57,183
So we will home to Rome,
and die among our neighbors.

1165
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:02,938
Nay.

1166
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:08,402
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot
tell what he would have...

1167
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,657
...yet kneels and holds
up hands for fellowship.

1168
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:18,162
Does reason our petition with more
strength than thou hast to deny it.

1169
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,836
Come, let us go.

1170
01:46:26,004 --> 01:46:29,298
This fellow had
a Volscian to his mother!

1171
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:34,845
His wife is in Corioles and
his child like him by chance.

1172
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:40,017
Yet give us our dispatch l am
hushed until our city be afire,

1173
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:41,894
and then l'll speak a little.

1174
01:47:00,455 --> 01:47:02,331
O Mother...

1175
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,547
Mother...

1176
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:14,552
What have you done?

1177
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:21,058
Behold...

1178
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:28,941
...the heavens do ope...

1179
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:33,612
...the gods look down...

1180
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:43,038
...and this unnatural scene
they laugh at.

1181
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,380
[sobbing] O my mother!

1182
01:47:58,138 --> 01:47:59,722
Mother!

1183
01:48:04,936 --> 01:48:06,270
[sobs] O!

1184
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:17,740
You have won...

1185
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:23,287
...a happy victory to Rome.

1186
01:48:26,124 --> 01:48:29,668
But for your son, believe it.

1187
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:32,838
O believe it.

1188
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:39,553
Most... dangerously
you have prevailed with him.

1189
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:44,475
lf not most mortal to him.

1190
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:50,981
But let it come.

1191
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:57,613
Aufidius...

1192
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:05,204
...though l cannot make true wars,
l'll frame convenient peace.

1193
01:49:06,748 --> 01:49:08,624
Now, good Aufidius,
were you in my stead,

1194
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:13,170
would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less? Aufidius?

1195
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:16,382
l was moved withal.

1196
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:21,262
l dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing

1197
01:49:21,429 --> 01:49:23,847
to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.

1198
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:30,396
But, good sir, what peace
you'll make, advise me.

1199
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:24,033
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.

1200
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,202
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

1201
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:33,042
We have all great cause
to give great thanks.

1202
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:38,756
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.

1203
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,687
How is it with our general?

1204
01:50:53,855 --> 01:50:56,523
As with a man by his own charity slain.

1205
01:50:56,691 --> 01:51:01,195
Our soldiers will remain uncertain
whilst 'twixt you there's difference,

1206
01:51:01,363 --> 01:51:03,906
but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all.

1207
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,449
l know it.

1208
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:10,245
And my pretext to strike
at him admits a good construction.

1209
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:17,294
l raised him, and l pawned
mine honor for his truth,

1210
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:20,631
who, being so heightened,

1211
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:24,343
he watered his new plants
with dews of flattery,

1212
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,178
seducing so my friends.

1213
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:32,685
At the last, l seemed his follower,
not partner,

1214
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:36,146
and he waged me with his countenance
as if l had been mercenary.

1215
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:39,149
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.

1216
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:42,027
And, in the last,
when he had carried Rome

1217
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:44,405
and that we looked
for no less spoil than glory...

1218
01:51:44,572 --> 01:51:46,615
There was it!

1219
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:49,368
For which my sinews shall be
stretched upon him.

1220
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:57,918
At a few drops of women's rheum,
which are as cheap as lies,

1221
01:51:58,086 --> 01:52:02,923
he sold the blood and labor
of our great action.

1222
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,137
Therefore shall he die...

1223
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:14,268
- ...and l'll renew me in his fall.
- [man whistles]

1224
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:17,062
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more.

1225
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:25,964
l am returned your soldier,

1226
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:29,760
no more infected with my country's love
than when l parted hence,

1227
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:34,014
but still subsisting
under your great command.

1228
01:53:34,182 --> 01:53:37,267
We have made peace with
no less honor to the Volscians

1229
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:39,269
than shame to the Romans.

1230
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:41,855
Tell the traitor,
in the highest degree

1231
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:45,734
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor? How now?

1232
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:48,153
Aye, traitor, Martius.

1233
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:51,698
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.

1234
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:54,535
Caius Martius.

1235
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:58,163
Dost thou think l'll grace
thee with that robbery,

1236
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:00,415
thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?

1237
01:54:01,876 --> 01:54:06,338
Perfidiously he hath
betrayed your business

1238
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:11,802
and given up,
for certain drops of salt,

1239
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,679
your city, Rome.

1240
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:19,518
l say "your city,"
for his wife and mother.

1241
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:26,233
Breaking his oath and resolution
like a twist of rotten silk.

1242
01:54:26,985 --> 01:54:30,821
Never admitting counsel of the war,
but at his nurse's tears,

1243
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:34,283
he whined and roared away your victory.

1244
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:36,034
Hear'st thou, Mars?

1245
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:39,329
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.

1246
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:44,710
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
too great for what contains it.

1247
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:48,463
"Boy"? O slave.

1248
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:51,258
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!

1249
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:56,346
Men and lads,
stain all your edges on me!

1250
01:54:56,514 --> 01:54:57,514
"Boy"?

1251
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:02,519
lf you have writ your annals true,

1252
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:05,981
'tis there that,
like an eagle in a dovecote,

1253
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:09,735
l fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.

1254
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,654
Alone l did it.

1255
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:14,990
"Boy."

1256
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:23,957
Let him die for it.

1257
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:31,506
[shouting]

1258
01:55:33,968 --> 01:55:35,177
[screams]

1259
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:41,642
[yells]

1260
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:53,528
- [moans softly]
- [wind whistling softly]

1261
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:32,442
[no audio]

1262
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:53,463
[knife rips out loudly]

1263
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:59,738
[♪ Lisa Zane: "Sta Pervolia"]
