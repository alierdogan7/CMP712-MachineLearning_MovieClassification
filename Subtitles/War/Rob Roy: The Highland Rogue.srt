[Screaming]

7
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,117
Those rangoons have done
the trick.

8
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,186
It's well we had them.

9
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:24,625
It takes more than foot soldiers
to stop highland men.

10
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,195
Prisoners, sir.

11
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,365
Three lads and a clan chief
among them, sir.

12
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,801
Halt.

13
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,536
The price of rebellion,
macgregor.

14
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,538
Take them to stirling.

15
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,378
Keep the rebels on the run.

16
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,483
- General argyll?
- Yes.

17
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,652
General cadogen reporting, sir.

18
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,522
Acting on orders from London
to reinforce your grace.

19
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:58,526
I'm in command of 4,000
mercenaries in the continent.

20
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,227
How will you have me use them?

21
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,362
You may march your men
to the top of the hill

22
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,164
In full view
of the highlanders

23
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,332
And hold them there.

24
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,200
You will give me the signal
to charge?

25
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,537
There will be no signal.

26
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,205
The very sight of such numbers
will win the day for us.

27
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,875
But me lord Duke,
my muskets can wipe

28
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,545
Every rebel in Scotland
off the face of the earth.

29
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,379
Give me a free hand.

30
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,848
And there will be more bullets
than heads

31
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,783
In half an hour.
No.

32
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:26,386
We must spare the lovely
blue bonnets.

33
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,221
They're the finest men
in the world.

34
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,291
I came to kill your lovely
blue bonnets.

35
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,127
And to sweep through the
highlands with fire and sod.

36
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,196
And by all the goats in...

37
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,099
I'm a highlander myself,
you bloody minded mercenary.

38
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,368
I should be fast to report
this to Mr. walpole.

39
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,703
Report what you will.

40
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,371
But whilst you're under
my command

41
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,807
You'll do as you're told.

42
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:04,825
[Distant bagpipes playing]

43
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,772
The men are coming home.

44
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,709
Aye, but some are not.

45
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,360
What has happened
to my Robbie?

46
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,831
They've taken him
to stirling castle.

47
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,866
You're his nearest kinsman

48
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,869
And you dare to show your faces
in the Glen without him.

49
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,205
We did but come to ask
for his best plaid and sporran

50
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,840
Then we'll give ourselves up
to be at his side.

51
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,208
Aye.

52
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,710
They'll not be
taking rob to england.

53
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,679
Like a "brickless Catherine"
he must go as a gentleman.

54
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:09,216
Even to his own hanging.

55
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,484
He is not hanged yet.

56
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,360
This is far enough.

57
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,429
You'll wait for me here.

58
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,365
I will not let your ladyship
go into stirling alone.

59
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,235
Right here, I tell you.

60
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,814
Argyll?

61
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:44,084
Yes, montrose.

62
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,386
The council
has been reviewing

63
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,221
Wightman's final report
of the battle.

64
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,389
Yes?

65
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,160
The figures
appear to be inconclusive.

66
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,828
In what way?

67
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:58,598
Our losses were greater
than those of the rebels.

68
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,334
My lord Duke, Victors
are not always measured

69
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,170
By the number slain.

70
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:07,040
I have no doubt that you can
make London see it that way.

71
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,313
Just a moment.

72
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:19,286
Cousin Margaret.

73
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,088
You know why I've come.

74
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,292
Aye.
You've been told.

75
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,095
I'm sorry, Margaret,
but I'm very...

76
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,097
You're busy just now?

77
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,132
Well, I uh...

78
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,270
I can wait.

79
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,339
Aye.

80
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,278
You have a list
of the prisoners?

81
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,348
Such as it is.
A mere 19 in all.

82
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,350
And only three
lairds among them.

83
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,854
However, we do have
the macgregor chief

84
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,355
To throw to the English
jurorists.

85
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,190
Scots should be tried
in Scotland.

86
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:57,991
Macgregor and all the rest.

87
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:01,194
My lord, would it not be
politic

88
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,330
In view
of so slight a victory

89
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,233
To deliver up our chief prize
for trial in London?

90
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,368
Would you be responsible
for taking him there?

91
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,303
I would indeed.

92
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,672
And you call yourself a scot.

93
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,308
There's literally none of the
good scots left in your speech

94
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,377
And none at all in your heart.
My lord.

95
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,180
What a child for a politician
like you, montrose.

96
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,049
A captive tied
at your chariot wheels.

97
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,151
I am not secretary of state
for Scotland.

98
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,152
You are.

99
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,187
And it's your loyalty
that may be questioned.

100
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,189
Not mine.

101
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,158
Have you interest
in my loyalty

102
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,161
Or the office I hold?

103
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,163
I'll tell you this,
argyll.

104
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,231
If you don't deliver macgregor
to London

105
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,200
You'll have no office to hold.

106
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,573
You'll do well
to think it over.

107
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,188
Her ladyship of glengyll.

108
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,124
Putting her ear to the door
like a serving wench.

109
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,126
And you born a Campbell.

110
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,528
I'm not proud
to be called Campbell.

111
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,530
When the chief of my own clan
put my Robbie in jail.

112
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,699
His own hot blood
put him there.

113
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,204
If yours
had not gone cold, argyll,

114
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,705
You'd be in jail
beside him.

115
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,307
Oh, I'm fighting
for Scotland too.

116
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,210
- Huh!
- But in a different way.

117
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,312
Long ago I realized
we can never seek the exiled

118
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,148
King James on england's throne.

119
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,218
If we're to live in peace,
we must be better neighbors.

120
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,220
And before I let hot heads
like your rob

121
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,389
Destroy old Scotland,
I'll see them all in jail.

122
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,160
London must think
you're the great man.

123
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,562
Margaret, I'm trying to get
an amnesty

124
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,231
For all the highlands.

125
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,499
To do so, I must make a vow
towards London.

126
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,335
It may sound hard to you.

127
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:53,506
But rob must stand his trial
with the rest.

128
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,043
Oh, I see now.

129
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,656
Would it help you at all
to send my Robbie to London?

130
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,258
Do you know
what you're saying?

131
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,694
Down there they'll stretch
his neck in a minute.

132
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,164
If...

133
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,531
If you did send him there,

134
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,134
Would his grace
the Duke of montrose take him?

135
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,136
Does it matter?

136
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,638
It might.

137
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,675
It's a long road to London.

138
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:33,113
The ways are bad and full
of highway men.

139
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,182
I should not like montrose
to fall in

140
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,184
With the kind of highway men
you would put in his path.

141
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,686
You macgregor woman, you.

142
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,223
Oh, you have my word
as one Campbell to another,

143
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,193
No macgregor would harm
a hair of his wig.

144
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,828
Oh, yes.
We must mind his wig.

145
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,498
T'would be a thundering great
catastrophe

146
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,134
If his lordship's feathers
were ruffled.

147
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,237
Oh, aye.

148
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,181
You must forgive my coachman
if he seems over anxious

149
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,183
To get you out of the country.

150
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,085
- Like his master.
- True.

151
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,087
Once you're rid
of me in London,

152
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,156
You think you'll have a free
hand in the highlands?

153
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,158
Half our crofters pay rent
to you, now.

154
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,062
I see no reason to deny
the other half my patronage.

155
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,332
- No reason but one.
- And what is that?

156
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,367
When my clansmen
have their belly full

157
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,368
Of thieving land robbers,

158
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:32,205
They have a way
of flinging them in the loch.

159
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,174
Nay, killearn.
Let him talk.

160
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,544
His words will be choked off
all too soon.

161
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:41,181
- Whoa there...
- Come on, come on.

162
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,217
Come on...
[Speaking gaelic]

163
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:48,555
Come away now.
[Speaking gaelic]

164
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,789
Wayfarer, make way.

165
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,890
Aye, sir, aye.

166
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,127
Did you not hear him?
Make way for the gentleman.

167
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,796
Aye.
Come on, come on, come on.

168
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,699
[Speaking gaelic]

169
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,170
You blathering fools
drive those sheep off the road.

170
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:34,334
Wipe the dust
from his clothes, nabby.

171
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,370
His lordship's wig.

172
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,342
There that's better.

173
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,678
Will your grace please accept
this small reminder

174
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,315
To keep your nose out
of macgregor business.

175
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,871
Oh, Robbie.

176
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,308
So you got away.
Aye.

177
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,344
Thanks to dugal,
Hugh and nabby.

178
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,113
- Oh, they're bonny lads.
- New curtains?

179
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,315
I was making things fine
for your homecoming.

180
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,184
You were so sure
I'd be back?

181
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,287
Well, I hoped.

182
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,058
Mother, the trouble's
not ended yet.

183
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,366
What are you looking for?

184
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,700
My father's pistols.

185
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,370
- I put them away.
- Where?

186
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,238
In the big chest
in my room.

187
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,053
You've no need of them, rob.

188
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,354
You wouldn't say that

189
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,589
If you knew who was
taking me to London.

190
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,491
I do know.

191
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,161
It was I who sent the men
to stop montrose's coach.

192
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:13,333
But it was argyll himself
who winked at what was done.

193
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,535
You went to argyll

194
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,605
And got down on your knees
to the great Campbell?

195
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,208
Have a care at
what you're saying, Robert.

196
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,609
I'm a Campbell too.

197
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,211
It seems you have forgotten
the fact

198
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,745
That you married a macgregor.

199
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,199
I am sorry, mother.

200
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:50,203
Argyll is not the enemy
you think he is.

201
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,205
He quelled
the rising of the clans

202
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,373
Like any englishman.

203
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,208
Yes, and he always will.

204
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,310
But once the fighting's over,

205
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,147
He's just as good a highlander
as you are.

206
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,216
He's set his mind on an amnesty
for the highlands.

207
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,219
He wants the war forgotten.

208
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,222
Why don't you
forget it too, rob?

209
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,391
Why don't you try
the ways of peace?

210
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,261
And settle down.

211
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,134
I suppose you have a Lassie
all picked out for me.

212
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,836
I don't know
who would have you.

213
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,306
Has no one at the inn
been asking about me?

214
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,442
- Do you mean Helen Mary?
- And why not?

215
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,444
Oh, she's been busy I hear.

216
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,845
Busy?

217
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,648
Well, you wouldn't expect
so bonny a Lassie

218
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,151
To be starved for attention,
now, would you?

219
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,286
Oh, no.

220
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,788
Not if that's what
she's wanting.

221
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,192
And why not?

222
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:50,697
Uh, is there anyone she might
have a particular fancy for?

223
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,533
- How would I know?
- Is there?

224
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,303
Well, if I were you...

225
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,539
Bring me that curtain,
please.

226
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,310
I would find out for myself.

227
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:07,214
I'll do no such thing.

228
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,148
It was the horseman
I tell you.

229
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,184
Take away the horseman

230
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,785
And throw him into
the river annan.

231
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,355
Ahh, they don't know
what fighting is nowadays.

232
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,226
It would be a far different
story back in '93.

233
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,694
Did I ever tell you about
the fighting at killiecrankie?

234
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,696
You see, it was like this.

235
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,533
There was a red coat coming
at me from the front.

236
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,202
And another all crouched
and ready to spring

237
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,169
From the rocks above.

238
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,171
And that's not counting the one
at the back

239
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,240
Who had me surrounded.

240
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,174
All I had was my sword.

241
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,678
And what do you think
I did then?

242
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,181
I cut and i...
and I slashed!

243
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,517
'Til the first one
gave ground.

244
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,186
I hacked at his head
and I hacked at his knees.

245
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,224
And then I told him to settle at
the hat of the one behind me.

246
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,192
Spit at the one
in the rocks above.

247
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,428
Whirl towards another one.

248
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,230
Break down his guard.

249
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,233
And...

250
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,402
The way we clip off a Daisy.

251
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,377
What was all that about?

252
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,712
Oh, I had just been slaying
and slaughtering

253
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,180
A few red coats.

254
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,382
- Oh.
- I'll chop the haggis.

255
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,383
You go back to your baking.

256
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,219
You'll need an apron
over that pretty dress.

257
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,221
What day is it today?

258
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,190
It's Thursday, Uncle hamish.

259
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,192
Oh, so it is.
So it is.

260
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,362
And why are you wearing
your Sunday best?

261
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,197
You're not expecting
anyone, are you?

262
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,200
- Oh, leave the girl alone.
- She started it.

263
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,803
Go on.
Get out of here.

264
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,072
Let's see now.
Where was I?

265
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,376
You were wading in red blood
right up to the knee.

266
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,312
Oh, yes, yes.

267
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,214
When I was in me prime.

268
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,218
I could bring down two
with every stroke.

269
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,386
Three!

270
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,090
And sometimes four.
[Laughing]

271
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,560
Out!
Out with you!

272
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,229
And you!

273
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,298
Good evening,
hamish MacPherson.

274
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:09,302
Rob!
Oh, rob, lad.

275
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,803
If you had me in the battle

276
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,306
The two of us could've chased
the sassanaks

277
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,074
All the way down to London.

278
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
Oh, there's no doubt
about it.

279
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,478
No doubt about it at all.

280
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,180
They say your cousin
dugal is a great man

281
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:23,182
With the claymore
and I don't deny it.

282
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,485
We're about the same tallness
and broadness

283
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,120
Though I may out weigh him
by a stone or two.

284
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,155
But oh, rob I wish you would
have seen me...

285
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,256
Good evening, rob.

286
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,159
In '93 when I was at
killiecrankie with montrose.

287
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,694
- Helen Mary i...
- Welcome home.

288
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,364
Not the montrose
that you escaped from.

289
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,499
No, not that markened evil

290
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,368
Who sold himself
to the English.

291
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,169
- Helen Mary...
- Excuse me.

292
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,871
No, no it...
It was his Uncle.

293
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:48,841
His Uncle the great montrose.
The bonny dundee.

294
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,845
Ahh, those were
the grand days.

295
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,114
Did you mind when you stalked
the sentry.

296
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,683
Aye...

297
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,118
Of all your great deeds,

298
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,053
That's the story
I like the best.

299
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,489
Aye.

300
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,358
And you took him by surprise
in broad daylight, aye.

301
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:08,628
That was the instinct
of the hunter.

302
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:13,500
There he was.

303
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,201
Standing up for all the world
to see

304
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,203
Like a cairn on
the Mountain top.

305
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,337
And there was...

306
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,810
Good evening.

307
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:28,381
Oh, rob.
It's grand to have you back.

308
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:31,317
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

309
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,486
You can help the Lassie
if you will mind.

310
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,189
Uh, thank you but, uh...

311
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,190
Helen Mary.

312
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,760
Could I have a straight forward
word with you?

313
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,261
Alone.
Alone?

314
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,531
What are you thinking of, rob?

315
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,599
I think I can be trusted.

316
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,835
Helen Mary.

317
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,703
Have I not been civil to you
in the past?

318
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,340
Oh, yes you have, rob.
Very civil.

319
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,543
Oh, you're a God-fearing lad,
rob.

320
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,377
But you've been away
to the wars.

321
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,612
And who knows
what you've picked up,

322
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,514
The loose ways of a soldier.

323
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,351
Talking from experience,
no doubt.

324
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,719
Pay no heed to him, rob.

325
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,121
Sit down.

326
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,799
You may speak as free
as you like.

327
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:23,536
There are no eavesdroppers
in this house.

328
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,638
And there'll be no bagpipes,
either.

329
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:29,075
I'm just going to soften
the Reed.

330
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:38,651
What was it you were wanting
to ask me about?

331
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,220
- I, uh...
- Yes, rob?

332
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,124
I wonder how matters
lie between us.

333
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,258
[Loud squawk]

334
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:52,164
You were wondering...

335
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,833
[High pitched squeak]
How matters lie between us.

336
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,767
Just what do you mean?
[Flat squeak]

337
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,104
I mean, you're not a bad
looking girl.

338
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,172
It's good of you
to say so.

339
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,173
And there are other lads
besides me who

340
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,242
Have thought so too.

341
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,844
Oh, I don't know.

342
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,847
And what about
Hector Stuart?

343
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,948
[Squeaking]

344
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,084
Well, he may have cast
his eye upon me in the kirk.

345
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,187
And no doubt you stared back
at that round-eyed-bullock.

346
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,689
I did not.

347
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19,692
Hector was minded to speak
a straightforward word too

348
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:24,296
But he never got past
the threshold.

349
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:30,202
- Have i...
- Whoa, no.

350
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:33,472
My mother sends you her love.

351
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,341
You can take mine
back to her.

352
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:38,511
She loves you
like her own daughter.

353
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:41,180
You wouldn't believe
the changes she's...

354
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,282
You wouldn't believe the changes
she's made in the house.

355
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,285
Uh, with two new
leather rushy chairs.

356
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,855
And new curtains... curtains
for the windows.

357
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,659
[Continuous squawking]
And a great bed of timber.

358
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:56,529
And a looking glass
as tall as...

359
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:59,231
A looking glass
as tall as yourself.

360
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,668
My.

361
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,703
Oh, there's many a lass
that would be proud

362
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:07,640
To have the over seeing of
a house like inversnaid.

363
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,208
I've no doubt.

364
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:12,178
Uh, maybe you would.

365
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,581
- It's better now.
- Shh!

366
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,517
Did you come looking for
a housekeeper or...

367
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,519
You think he be looking
for a wife?

368
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,354
Well, the man must have
something to look at

369
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,523
After the kirk on Sundays.

370
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,759
You know fine why I've come.

371
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,828
I've been casting my eye
upon you too.

372
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,830
These last three years.

373
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,265
Have you now?

374
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,734
Why would you ever do that?

375
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,207
Helen Mary...

376
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,243
Will you be my...
[Bagpipe squealing]

377
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:53,085
What do you say?

378
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,319
Kinsmen and friends.

379
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:30,156
To Helen Mary.
My bride.

380
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,458
She's blythe and she's bonny.

381
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,227
She's my mother over again.

382
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,497
And I'd spill my heart's blood
in her defense.

383
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,801
As this will be token.

384
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,336
[Cheers]

385
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,305
Aw, she's a bonny wee lass.

386
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,274
* we will all sing so gay
we will drink while we may *

387
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:51,077
* with a toast to our laddy
in a merry merry cup *

388
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,611
* we will set our cares aside

389
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,180
* if you'll kiss
the bonny bride *

390
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,347
* and go leaping
high and wide *

391
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,283
* while your legs
will hold you up *

392
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,350
[Laughing]

393
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,528
[Singing in gaelic]

394
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,400
[Loud cheers]

395
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,356
What brings you here?

396
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,694
I come to read a proclamation
from king George.

397
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:32,331
It has pleased his majesty
to signify his approval

398
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,134
Of an act of grace and pardon.

399
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,469
Granting an amnesty
to all persons who committed

400
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,139
Any treasonable offenses
against him.

401
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,141
Such pardon and amnesty
to be granted

402
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,210
To all the highland clans.

403
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:48,480
Save only the cursed
and traitorous clan macgregor.

404
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:52,351
Who's name shall be
forever abolished.

405
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,154
Here with, it is decreed

406
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,089
That any man
known as macgregor

407
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:59,158
Shall henceforward
call himself

408
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,493
And his bairns
already procreated

409
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:05,764
After any other surname
he may choose.

410
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,334
And it shall be unlawful

411
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,169
For a minister of the church
of Scotland

412
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,205
To baptize or christen
any male child

413
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,208
Called by the name
of macgregor.

414
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:20,112
Nor shall any man
of the clan macgregor

415
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:22,214
At any time bear arms,

416
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:25,217
Either weapons offensive
or weapons defensive.

417
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:27,219
Under pain of death.

418
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,720
You and your black cattle

419
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:32,258
Had best get out of macgregor
country while you may.

420
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:39,865
Still high and mighty.

421
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,202
Maybe this will cool
your pride.

422
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,605
I bear a warrant for the arrest
of the escaped prisoner

423
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,209
Rob macgregor and his return
to stirling castle.

424
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,379
Signed and sealed by the
secretary of state for Scotland.

425
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,115
Don't you believe him, rob.

426
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,049
The Duke of argyll

427
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,385
Would never put his name
to such an order.

428
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,222
This order is from
the new secretary.

429
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,392
The Duke of montrose.
Let me see it.

430
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,561
With pleasure, my dear lady.

431
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:14,233
If you didn't abide among
the myths and the crows,

432
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,668
You'd know that argyll has been
stripped of his offices

433
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,305
And sent to his castle
at inveraray.

434
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,241
Then your montrose's private
fencibles.

435
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:22,975
Aye.

436
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,643
Sent to humble
the MacGregors.

437
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,113
Aye.

438
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,215
- Give us the word, rob.
- Aye, give us the word.

439
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,324
No, put up your decks.

440
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,359
And go back to the punchbowl.

441
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,528
- Aye.
- The punch bowl.

442
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,530
Aye.

443
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,332
Go and get puggled
if you want,

444
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,334
But if you try any
of your games

445
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:52,071
This time we'll take more than
your names away from you.

446
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,310
Rob!

447
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,849
Go with my mother,
Helen Mary.

448
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,184
To inversnaid.

449
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:08,354
Come now.

450
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:11,523
You've not seen the last
of rob macgregor.

451
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,363
It takes more than the hook of
a sassanak

452
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,498
To hold a Scottish salmon.

453
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,235
Get after him!

454
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,412
[Speaking indistinctly]

455
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,322
I'll look down.

456
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,315
Behind the great stone.

457
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,489
Down stream near thunderhead.

458
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,050
A day and a night
is a long time to wait.

459
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:23,655
Are you sure he said
he'd meet us here.

460
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:27,393
Aye.
He said the punchbowl.

461
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,267
No, he's not coming.

462
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,203
Don't fret yourself, dugal.

463
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,871
Those fencibles will never
take Robert to the highlands.

464
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,340
Well, he's not here now.

465
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,808
Give them time, man.

466
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,511
He's had all the time
in the world and more.

467
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,346
You needn't get your beard
in a blaze.

468
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,181
Aye, bide wee while longer.

469
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:53,051
Sit down, man.
Sit down.

470
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,058
[Singing in gaelic]

471
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,200
Ahh, hold your voice.

472
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,236
And you hold yours.

473
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,338
I like to hear the lad sing.

474
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,340
This is no time for singin'.

475
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,174
Or for argy-bargy.

476
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:19,144
You old women can sit here
'til the stroke of day.

477
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,179
I'm going after rob,
even if I have to go on my own.

478
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:24,683
- You'll not go alone, dugal.
- Me too.

479
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,052
All right, come on then.

480
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,154
You're chief gave orders
to meet him here

481
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,155
And here you'll stay
until he comes.

482
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,524
- Stand aside, you.
- Stop!

483
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,826
What's all this
tramash about?

484
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,695
It was me.
It was my doing.

485
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,196
Aye, I don't doubt that.

486
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,198
Oh, he was just wanting
to go after you, rob.

487
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,601
There'll be no
going after me.

488
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,336
And there'll be
no more fighting.

489
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,338
Either among yourselves
or against others.

490
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:48,073
Now that montrose
is the high and mighty

491
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,775
Lordling of Scotland,
the clan will have to fight.

492
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:50,776
No, dugal.

493
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,378
If the clan shows fight,

494
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,346
He'll burn you out
of house and steading.

495
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,615
You're not the man he wants.
He's after me.

496
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,217
You will not be for giving
yourself up, rob.

497
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,352
Oh, no.

498
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:01,887
I'll lead his lordship
such a chase

499
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,555
He'll have no time left
for the rest of the MacGregors.

500
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,124
And we're to let you take all
the blows and knocks?

501
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,593
What kind of men
do you think we are?

502
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,295
I know the kind
you're going to be.

503
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:12,063
You're going back
to your own houses.

504
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,199
And hide your pistols
in the grain bins

505
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,867
And your claymores
in the thatch.

506
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,370
And learn
to speak as discreetly

507
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,438
As a Glasgow Bailey.

508
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,240
With our bonnets
in our hands.

509
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,375
Aye.

510
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,412
With your bonnets
in your hands.

511
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,818
Rob.

512
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,388
Rob, you did come back.

513
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,499
Oh, Helen Mary.

514
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,269
You made a bad bargain
when you took me for husband.

515
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,236
Don't say that, rob.

516
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,474
If I had known all this
was in store for me,

517
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:33,144
Aye, and ten times worse,
I'd still have married you.

518
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,850
No sign of him yet, sir.

519
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,285
You sure he didn't slip
past you in the dark?

520
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,152
No, sir.

521
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,188
I've a 20 men
on it all night long.

522
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,222
Hmm.

523
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:52,163
- What are you going to do?
- I'll take to the Heather.

524
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:56,167
- You'll not go far away?
- No, I must look to my clan.

525
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,336
If I don't keep an eye on
those hotheads,

526
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,207
They'll have themselves hanged
within a 12-month.

527
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,642
But in the end,

528
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,212
I'm driven from these hills
into the far north.

529
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,214
I'll not leave without you.

530
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,249
I'll be waiting.

531
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,855
[Pounding at the door]

532
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,390
Open up!

533
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,202
Where is rob macgregor?

534
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,238
I don't know.

535
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,409
I give you my word.
My son is not here.

536
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:42,414
[Gunfire]

537
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,182
Well?

538
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,185
The Duke of montrose
is entitled to his rent money.

539
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:04,322
But he's no right
to the double tax.

540
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,290
No right?

541
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:19,437
I want my receipt too.

542
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,206
And what do you
call yourself?

543
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,508
My name is dugal macgregor.

544
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,210
There is no such name
as macgregor.

545
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,647
Put him down as macalister
and be done with it.

546
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,197
There will be none of that
in my house.

547
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,299
This is the inn
of hamish MacPherson.

548
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,567
- Why you...
- Torcal!

549
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,708
So it's your inn?
Yes.

550
00:42:56,742 --> 00:43:00,712
And where's the charter
for the land you built it on?

551
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,413
There is my charter.

552
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:09,554
And there's mine.

553
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,722
No, dugal!

554
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:12,824
Any more trouble from you

555
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:15,493
Or any of the rest of you
mangy tykes,

556
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:16,895
I will take you out
to stirling

557
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,798
And leave your crofts forfeit.

558
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:22,768
Now maybe
you'll listen to me.

559
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:26,805
This is the quarter rent you
paid to the Duke of montrose.

560
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:31,309
The same as it always is.
Aye.

561
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,179
But this one
grows and grows.

562
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,481
Next quarter
it'll be doubled.

563
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,183
Then doubled again.

564
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,351
Until it grows so great

565
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:42,821
You'll have to sell your
livestock and your farm gear

566
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,823
And your land itself...

567
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,191
To keep the bag full.

568
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:49,828
Unless you wish
to claim it now.

569
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:53,198
The whole sum will be posted
as a reward

570
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:57,168
For the man who leads us
to rob Roy macgregor.

571
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:03,308
I'll claim it.

572
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,344
Take their weapons.

573
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,279
Dugal, give it to maccallum.

574
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,480
Throw them in the loch.

575
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:11,349
Aye.

576
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,861
Give every man back
what he is due.

577
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,863
Aye.

578
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:25,864
As for you,

579
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:30,068
You poor cowardly
walking act of parliament,

580
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,336
Go and tell your master this.

581
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:35,206
My men have laid down
their arms.

582
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,542
They obey your laws
because I told them to.

583
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,378
And that command they still
must keep.

584
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:44,315
As for me, you may take me
if you can.

585
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,252
But leave my men alone.

586
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,354
For any Levy you may plague them
with hereafter,

587
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:52,758
I'll take double the amount
from montrose's own granary.

588
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,060
And from his cattle herds.

589
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:57,362
If you burn out our macgregor
crofts and steadings,

590
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,429
I'll burn yours.

591
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,331
If you kill my men,

592
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:04,569
I'll kill you, killearn.

593
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:13,378
Time after time you let
the red macgregor

594
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,546
Slip through your fingers.

595
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,682
And that's not all.

596
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,885
On the 20th day of this month

597
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:23,221
To punish dugal macgregor
for false information,

598
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:26,424
You stripped his croft
of its farm gear.

599
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,427
Is that not so?
True, your grace.

600
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,196
And on the 21st,

601
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:36,201
Ten of my finest cattle
disappeared.

602
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,203
You further report

603
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,205
That fencibles courted
at macgregor houses

604
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:46,211
Are way laid and beaten
by an unknown hand.

605
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:51,216
An unknown hand,
you witless goat?

606
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,550
Already you've made me
the laughing stock

607
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,219
Of Edinburgh and stirling.

608
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,287
Now London
is asking questions.

609
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,389
Mr. walpole himself.

610
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:01,226
We've done our best, my lord.
But I need more men.

611
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,494
You have all my fencible
troops now,

612
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:06,231
Save only my personal guards.

613
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:09,100
How many do you need
to capture one man?

614
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:12,637
He's more than one man,
your grace.

615
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,440
The plowman on the hill
is rob macgregor.

616
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,275
The man who carries the water
from the spring

617
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,443
Is rob macgregor.

618
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,678
The boatman on the loch
is rob macgregor.

619
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,148
And even the wee lad who fetches
in the cows.

620
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,351
As for the women.

621
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:28,686
Not a soul of honor.

622
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,456
Her ladyship of glengyll

623
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,658
Has swore herself
with such conviction

624
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,127
That the devil himself
would've believed her.

625
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:39,297
And all that time she was
hiding her son in the house.

626
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:43,301
Then bring her in.

627
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,137
We'll show them
what our courts can do

628
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,639
To those who harbor
prescribed outlaw.

629
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,109
A desperate measure,
your grace.

630
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,278
It may make the outlaw
desperate too.

631
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,181
Aye, and it may bring
the whole clan of macgregor.

632
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:59,617
We'll sorely need the packing
of the red coats.

633
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,119
Very well.

634
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,188
If colonel carpenter
can spare us the soldiers,

635
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,357
We rig ourselves a fort
at inversnaid.

636
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,722
You have no right
to strip my house.

637
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:13,291
For harboring an outlaw,

638
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,260
Your cattle's a forfeit
to the crown.

639
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:20,798
As for you, my fine lady,
we're taking you to stirling.

640
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,433
She did not rig,
you're lord.

641
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,235
She did not know her son
was in the house.

642
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,704
Torcal!

643
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,239
Get rid of the girl.

644
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,146
Slinking coward,
leave the girl alone.

645
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,090
Helen Mary...

646
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,764
Muskets!

647
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,207
Rob!

648
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:33,371
- Are you all right, mother?
- Yes, here, rob.

649
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:34,405
Get down.

650
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:07,472
Dugal!

651
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,539
[Shouting]

652
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:32,363
[Coughing]

653
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:37,435
She can't endure the smoke
much longer.

654
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:39,504
[Coughing]

655
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,340
Macgregor!

656
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,609
Come out, macgregor!

657
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,645
We'll spare your women
if you give yourself up.

658
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:19,076
Macgregor!

659
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:30,588
Bring her out, Helen Mary.

660
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,536
[Coughing and choking]

661
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,694
Willy, fetch rob.

662
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:16,534
Run!

663
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:21,138
[Yelling indistinctly]

664
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:26,177
[Speaking indistinctly]

665
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,668
What is it, rob?

666
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,837
I must look to my mother.

667
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:55,340
Dugal, see that the fort
is surrounded.

668
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,342
Don't let one of them
show his head outside.

669
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:02,380
We'll keep them in siege until
they starve or surrender.

670
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,249
Aye.

671
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:08,319
Robbie...

672
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:11,489
He's coming, mother.

673
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:16,261
He mustn't fight
with the soldiers.

674
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:20,865
You must stop him,
Helen Mary.

675
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,234
Yes, mother.

676
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:26,371
There must be
no more killing.

677
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:30,541
It's so easy
to set the Heather on fire.

678
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:35,813
It's so hard to put it out.

679
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,663
[Bagpipe playing
in the distance]

680
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,188
I have come to honor
my kinswoman.

681
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,359
You honor us all,
my lord.

682
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:56,527
Your mother was
a great lady.

683
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:57,728
God blessed and bless her.

684
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,343
Macgregor,

685
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:15,846
This time there'll be
no escape.

686
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,149
You barbarian.
You crude unfeeling fool.

687
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,151
Get you gone!

688
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,353
Take them both.

689
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:25,356
[Speaking gaelic]

690
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:39,537
So your Campbells
have joined the MacGregors.

691
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,138
Mr. walpole
shall hear of this.

692
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,873
Still threatening me
with London?

693
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:46,343
Then I'll tell you something
about our king's minister

694
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,379
You may not know.

695
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:51,215
Mr. walpole buys many men
like you, aye,

696
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:53,418
And sells them too
if they no longer please him.

697
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:56,421
So get back South
and lick his boots

698
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,555
While yet you may.

699
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:24,214
"I am the resurrection
and the life," says the lord.

700
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:26,451
"He that believeth in me
though he were dead,"

701
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:28,586
" yet, shall he live."

702
00:56:36,794 --> 00:56:38,529
Fare yee well, my lord.

703
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:40,598
We MacGregors stand
in debt to you.

704
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,366
The highlands would be
in your debt

705
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,702
Were you to lift the siege
from inversnaid fort.

706
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,204
And let my mother's murders
go free?

707
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,372
No.

708
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,541
We tried to have peace,
my lord.

709
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,209
And when
they denied us amnesty,

710
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,244
We still tried
to keep their laws.

711
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:57,114
But now we know they'd ravage
and burn and butcher us all

712
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,449
If we laid down our arms again.

713
00:56:58,483 --> 00:57:00,485
Not if I could have you
included

714
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:01,552
In the general amnesty.

715
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:03,721
I have lost office.

716
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,791
I have lost the ear
of Mr. walpole.

717
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,225
But as a knight of the guard

718
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,627
That I still may go
to the king.

719
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,562
You have concerned yourself
too much

720
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:12,530
With our quarrel already.

721
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:15,432
The peace of the highlands
concerns us all.

722
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:18,469
Will you not try once more
to let reason prevail?

723
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:22,272
I will not give a promise
I may not be able to keep.

724
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,542
But again, my thanks.

725
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,314
Helen Mary, I beg you
to restrain him.

726
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:33,283
He may listen to you.

727
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:36,220
I'll do all I can.

728
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,199
You must
let the soldiers go, rob.

729
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:51,368
And give our guile
a chance to make peace.

730
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,170
And be murdered for it?

731
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:56,373
I'd rather be shot for a wolf
than a sheep.

732
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,308
Maybe you must humble
your pride

733
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:01,345
For the sake of the rest.

734
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:05,482
It's so easy to set
the Heather on fire.

735
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:08,318
So hard to put it out.

736
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:11,522
Empty words, Helen Mary.

737
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:15,225
They're not mine, rob.

738
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:20,097
Those were the last words
spoken by your mother.

739
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,546
Sir, rob macgregor himself
has come

740
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,181
Under a flag of truce.

741
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,683
He is offering us terms.

742
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,350
Offering us terms?

743
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:43,688
You go back and tell him...
i pray you, sir.

744
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:46,724
Let me give him his answer.

745
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:55,465
Macgregor!

746
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,242
Well, is it peace or war?

747
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,385
- Is it bad, rob?
- No.

748
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:19,289
Now rob, do we beg for mercy
without bullets in our hands?

749
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:22,426
No.
It's war.

750
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,881
Here.
Here you are, lady.

751
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:48,285
A new ballad about rob Roy.
All for one penny.

752
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,154
The Duke's mayor
rode from stirling

753
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:51,722
And up to inversnaid

754
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:55,392
To put 100 pound
on rob macgregor's head.

755
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,395
The girl did went a beggin',
so did the Duke, as well.

756
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,332
For in walked bold macgregor
and claimed it for himself.

757
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,301
Here it is.
It's true history.

758
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,502
Thank you, lady.

759
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,705
True history
as I'm a Christian woman.

760
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,144
Sir, you're a quick little
fellow.

761
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,045
Your manners
are in your elbows.

762
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:24,521
Mr. billingsley?

763
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:29,359
The highland rogue,
if you please.

764
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,195
Certainly, countess.

765
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:35,332
I am deeply honored
by his majesty's patronage.

766
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:41,205
This cabinet meeting
has been called, gentlemen,

767
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,808
To consider the very dangerous
state of affairs

768
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,811
Existing in
the Scottish highlands.

769
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:49,179
Our secretary of state
for Scotland

770
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:52,049
Brings with him the disturbing
intelligence

771
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,517
That the clan macgregor

772
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,186
Led by their outlaw chieftain,
rob Roy,

773
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,855
Has openly revolted.

774
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:02,059
And besieged the king's
fort at inversnaid.

775
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,494
We have
every reason to believe

776
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,330
That the other clans
will join them

777
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,199
In a full scale uprising.

778
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,335
The other clans appear
to be quite content

779
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,870
With the king's amnesty.

780
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:16,874
My lord marlborough,
the amnesty saved their hides.

781
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:20,878
But their loyalty to the king
is only skin deep.

782
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,880
Scratch a highlander

783
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:25,182
And you'll find a rebel
underneath.

784
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,851
Why doesn't
colonel carpenter

785
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,352
March a force up
to relieve the fort?

786
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,188
Because, sir, it might
seriously weaken

787
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,490
His Garrison at stirling

788
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,592
And in the face
of a general revolt.

789
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:40,197
What general revolt?

790
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:46,503
The clans rose in '48
and in '78 and in '93.

791
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:51,708
And they tried it again
only a few short months ago.

792
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:55,179
All they've ever needed
to touch them off

793
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,781
Is one troublemaker.

794
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,383
Now they have macgregor.

795
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,685
Tempest in a teapot.

796
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,221
Can be more serious
than you think, marlborough.

797
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,523
We haven't the time
for bickering.

798
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,127
Has his majesty been
made aware of the situation?

799
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,129
It was the king himself
who requested us

800
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:15,132
To sift the facts and present
our recommendations.

801
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,535
His majesty is even now
in the throne room

802
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:22,472
Conducting his own unique study
of the highland situation.

803
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:30,280
"And then the coachmen
had been let go.

804
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:33,617
"And montrose himself

805
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:39,389
"Was sitting
in the dust of the road.

806
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:45,295
"Rob Roy lifted the wig
of the Duke of montrose

807
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:49,166
Und"... and, and...

808
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,503
Tweaked.

809
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:56,473
What is this... tweak?

810
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,477
Tweaked his nose.

811
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:06,316
- Tweaked?
- Yeah.

812
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:10,520
Tweaked his nose?

813
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:19,096
- [Speaking german]
- Yes.

814
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,464
Your majesty?

815
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,300
The Duke of argyll
earnestly requests an audience

816
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,369
With his majesty.

817
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:29,840
[Speaking German]

818
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:35,345
Argyll.
[Speaking German]

819
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:38,682
His majesty
will receive him.

820
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:41,318
Your grace.

821
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:47,057
His grace,
the Duke of argyll.

822
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:48,458
Does the Duke not realize

823
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,527
That he's no longer
an accepted person at court?

824
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,862
I do indeed.

825
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:54,231
Know that I am true
to that great cause.

826
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,166
But I beg of you to explain
to his majesty

827
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,202
That when the safety
of the realm is in danger,

828
01:03:58,235 --> 01:04:00,637
An honest man will go
straight to his king.

829
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,639
Then how many troops
do you propose

830
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,141
To send to the highlands?

831
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,343
I believe 6,000
would be adequate.

832
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,712
6,000?

833
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:11,181
To relieve one small fort?

834
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:12,649
My lord marlborough,

835
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,086
It is not for me to expound
the philosophy of war

836
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,090
To the hero of blenheim and
the first soldier of Europe.

837
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:21,525
But I must humbly propose

838
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,693
That we follow
your military examples.

839
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,163
And strike a ruthless
and crushing blow

840
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,165
At the head and front
of the trouble.

841
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,767
Oh, well...

842
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,735
I suppose
if the secretary's

843
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:35,539
Going to cite
my own campaigns against me.

844
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:39,509
He's right, marlborough.
It's reason and good sense.

845
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:40,377
Perfectly sound.

846
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,379
I agree, my lord.

847
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:45,515
I have never questioned
the secretary's wisdom.

848
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:49,353
My only concern is where I'll
find the money for the troops.

849
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,221
All you can think about,
walpole,

850
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:53,457
Is money, money, money.

851
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,293
I'll never mention
the word again, sir...

852
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,695
If you will show me a way
to get along without it.

853
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,131
[Laughing]

854
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:05,335
How, walpole, how montrose,
killearn.

855
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:25,655
Majesty, I am astounded
to find his grace of argyll

856
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:27,224
Admitted to the royal presence.

857
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:30,227
He more than any other
has been responsible

858
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,395
For thwarting
our secretary's attempt

859
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,230
To capture
the outlaw macgregor.

860
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,601
That I am proud to admit.

861
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,637
Will the countess please
explain to his majesty

862
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,339
That this brave gentleman

863
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,474
Tried to surprise
rob Roy macgregor

864
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:45,809
At his mother's funeral.

865
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:51,481
We in the highlands
respect our dead.

866
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,683
My liege, lord.

867
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:56,320
Mr. walpole will tell you
that the cabinet

868
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,322
Has this day recommended
the immediate dispatch

869
01:05:58,355 --> 01:06:02,192
Of 6,000 soldiers to bring
the highlands under control.

870
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:05,362
Not one would be needed
were it not for this man.

871
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,464
They'll not need it now.

872
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,167
Send bandits
into our mountains

873
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,270
And they'll be matched
with murdering knives.

874
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,339
But if you will send me
alone and unarmed

875
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,507
To speak the words
a highlander can understand,

876
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:21,045
I will bring rob Roy macgregor
back with me to London.

877
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:23,180
Preposterous.

878
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,348
The only thing a highlander
can understand is...

879
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,483
Genug!

880
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:30,387
[Speaking German]

881
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:43,067
Macgregor?
Here in London?

882
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:48,805
[Speaking German]

883
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,208
Zehr gut...

884
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,210
[Speaking German]

885
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,230
Rob.

886
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,467
Get you back to the inn.

887
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,202
Oh, rob.
You cannot do it.

888
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:53,370
You keep out of this.

889
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:57,441
I tried to make peace.
I did as you asked, Helen Mary.

890
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,209
As your mother asked.

891
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,212
Aye, and both of you wrong.

892
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,714
I'll trust no man again
unless he be kinsmen to me.

893
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,450
Nor listen to any woman.

894
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,318
And no one will stop me

895
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:10,254
Blowing those cutthroats
out of the highlands.

896
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,452
[Whistling]

897
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,524
MacGregors!

898
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,398
[Speaking indistinctly]

899
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:28,057
Give a hand.

900
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:30,226
What's in it, lad?
She's loaded with gun powder.

901
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,562
Good, we'll rake them
with it.

902
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,478
Light your head start.

903
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:25,349
Stand back, macgregor.

904
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:29,252
Order your men
out of the fort.

905
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,054
If you don't...

906
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:54,077
Rob.

907
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:04,488
You've made a desperate fool
of yourself, macgregor.

908
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:07,223
And you've made
a fool of me.

909
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:10,193
I went to the king
to plead your cause.

910
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,195
He heard me out and bade me
bring you to London

911
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:13,229
To make your peace.

912
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,666
And now, you've committed
an overt act of war,

913
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,503
Which may well be more
than the king can forgive.

914
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:22,238
Do you think we MacGregors
will bow the knee

915
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,172
To German geordie?

916
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:27,176
No.
We took this fort.

917
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,380
And we'll hold it against
all your kings.

918
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:34,183
[All agreeing]

919
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:37,186
If you do, I'll come back
with an army

920
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,556
And take it from you
myself.

921
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:43,259
Ahh, let him go.

922
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,094
- We need no fear of them.
- We're with you, rob.

923
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:48,097
- Aye, to the last man.
All: Aye.

924
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:51,367
You're brave men.

925
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:53,537
And when
the English armies come

926
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,539
And set
the whole highlands aflame,

927
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,707
Bravely you will die
to the last man.

928
01:12:57,741 --> 01:13:00,209
And then nothing will be left
of the clan macgregor.

929
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:02,446
Nothing but the women
and the burned houses

930
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,382
And the fatherless bairns,
to tell of your glorious deeds.

931
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,618
Do you think I'll sing
your praises then,

932
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:09,853
Robert macgregor?

933
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,557
No, I'll say that once
you were a man

934
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,525
Who wanted to save
your people.

935
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,461
You even denied yourself
a wife

936
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:20,530
That none might suffer
because of you.

937
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:22,131
I honored you then.

938
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:25,635
But I do not honor you now.

939
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:32,208
Oh, now,
the Lassie means well,

940
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,543
But you know how women are.

941
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:35,211
They'll have you dead
and buried

942
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,446
Before you've done
any fighting at all.

943
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,782
There'll be some fighting
by the time we gather the clans.

944
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,450
We'll gather
all the clans, rob.

945
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:42,218
Aye, the robertsons
of stranraer

946
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,419
Will join the drummonds of
perth...

947
01:13:43,453 --> 01:13:45,555
And the banffshire Gordons
and the good man of the board.

948
01:13:45,589 --> 01:13:46,723
We'll surely meet and go
quicker.

949
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,726
Then the Stuarts of oban
will come in.

950
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,661
And the mackenzies of kinkill

951
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,396
And the canoms of Murray
on the hill.

952
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,899
And the macclains of mull or...

953
01:13:55,932 --> 01:14:00,169
[Speaking indistinctly]

954
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,638
They'll find a whole swarm
of blue bonnets

955
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,507
A buzzin' about their ears.

956
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:13,249
Where is rob Roy?

957
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,619
Sire, macgregor
has refused to come.

958
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:17,186
Worse than that,

959
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,622
He has taken your fort
at inversnaid

960
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,357
And is determined to hold it.

961
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,627
If the other clans join him,

962
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,629
The army these gentlemen
have vantaged upon you

963
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:27,163
Will be most solemnly needed

964
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,633
In a such a pass,
your majesty.

965
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,367
The only reparation
I can make

966
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,170
Is humbly to offer my sword
against the rebels,

967
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,539
To redeem my failure.

968
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:37,641
[Speaking German]

969
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:40,710
[Bagpipes playing]

970
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,364
[Speaking German]

971
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:04,067
Is this rob Roy?

972
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,856
His majesty awaits you.

973
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,424
Alone.

974
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,657
I have come to your majesty

975
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,292
Because you sent the Duke
of argyll to me.

976
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:38,394
I trust him.

977
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,398
And ask his pardon.

978
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:46,502
From your majesty,
I ask no favor but one.

979
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:48,437
I beg of you.

980
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:52,141
Grant amnesty to my clan.

981
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:57,080
As for me,
you may do what you will.

982
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,684
[Speaking German]

983
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:07,857
I have heard...

984
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:10,126
I hear many things.

985
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:21,504
I hear you've captured
my soldiers and take my fort.

986
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:24,107
You bring disgrace
upon my clan.

987
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,675
And take my name away from me.

988
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:29,478
I pray, your majesty.
Let me remove this insolence.

989
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:33,683
The king does not fear
the bold enemy.

990
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:37,320
The king fears only
the self seeking friend.

991
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:46,062
I give you back your sword...

992
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:47,496
And your name.

993
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:53,703
Rob Roy macgregor.

994
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,344
You are the great rogue.

995
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:05,214
And you, sire,

996
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:09,418
Are a great king.

997
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:11,654
Oh, it must have been
a wonderful sight, you.

998
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,189
And what happened then?

999
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,758
Right into the palace
we went.

1000
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:17,426
And there in the great hall,

1001
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,196
Sitting all alone with his hat
on his head,

1002
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,198
Was king geordie.

1003
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:25,201
Glowering out of a great wig.

1004
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:27,203
Oh, I wish I could
have seen him.

1005
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:29,205
And what was he like?

1006
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:32,208
He was like her ladyship's
Galloway nag.

1007
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:36,112
When he's just going
to take a bite out of you.

1008
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:39,215
And you should have seen
the lords and Dukes

1009
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,217
With their clipped up breeches.

1010
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,519
And wee buttons hanging
about the knees

1011
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,353
To clip them up.

1012
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:46,389
And not a man's sword
among them.

1013
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:49,058
And right through
all the courtiers

1014
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:52,461
Bending and bowing like
barley in the wind,

1015
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,363
Marches rob.

1016
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:58,768
As proud and as straight
as an evergreen pine.

1017
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:01,204
And he says to the king,
he says, geordie,

1018
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:04,540
I've come to get my name back
and I'll take my pardon now.

1019
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,376
Aye, the king liked the look
of rob.

1020
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,612
And the king said,
"macgregor," he said

1021
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:11,247
"How would you like to be

1022
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,649
My secretary of state
for Scotland?"

1023
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,251
And rob said, "I'd do it,
geordie",

1024
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:16,452
"But I have got to go home now

1025
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,721
"And look after my great herds
of cattle.

1026
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,457
Give the post back to argyll."

1027
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,126
Do you hear that, Helen Mary?

1028
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:26,329
I heard.

1029
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,131
When do you think
he'll be back?

1030
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:31,234
Oh, you needn't be looking
for him yet, Lassie.

1031
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,335
The way they were wining
and dining,

1032
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,237
He won't be back for a week.

1033
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,172
And what were
the fine ladies like?

1034
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:39,442
They were covered with jewels
all over.

1035
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,178
Great red heathen
carbuncle stones

1036
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:43,346
On their fingers.

1037
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,849
And diamonds as big
as duck's eggs

1038
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:49,252
Hanging from their ears.

1039
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:53,356
Were the ladies very...

1040
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:55,691
Were they clothed
very beautiful?

1041
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:59,695
Well, uh, they had
Crocker nonnies

1042
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:03,132
And barbs of ribbon
piled up on their heads.

1043
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,801
Oh, and quilt and combs.

1044
01:20:05,835 --> 01:20:08,271
And they walked
on wee cloppers

1045
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,873
With heels so high

1046
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,674
That a man had to carry them
in his arm

1047
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:13,042
For fear they would fall over.

1048
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:15,211
Oh, that must have been
a lovely sight.

1049
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,612
The painted hussies.

1050
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,215
They better not make
sheep's eyes at our Robbie.

1051
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:20,516
Oh, it's only natural

1052
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,351
When a man marches into a town
after a battle,

1053
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:25,188
Swinging along to the skattle
of the pipes.

1054
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:26,622
That the ladies
would look down

1055
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,857
From their balconies
and windows

1056
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:29,492
