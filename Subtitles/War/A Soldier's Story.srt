Pete?

1008
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:15,948
He just asked a couple
of questions about
the baseball game,

1009
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,533
some about the sarge.

1010
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,326

I hated Waters for it, sir.
Hated?

C.J. ain't killed nobody.

He hit Waters, didn't he?
Yeah, but the sergeant made him, sir.

01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,516
He called that boy things
he ain't never heard before.

C.J. was from the farm,

That jail cell started doing
crazy things to C.J., sir.
