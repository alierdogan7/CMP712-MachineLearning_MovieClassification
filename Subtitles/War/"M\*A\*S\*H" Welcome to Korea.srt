[Muttering]

2
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,732
- Corporal.
- Oh. Mmm.

3
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:18,770
- <i>O'Reilly.!</i>
- Huh?

4
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:21,773
Yeah, Ma. Feed the chickens,
slop the pigs. I know. Soo-ee!

5
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,775
Come on, soldier,
hit the deck!

6
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:26,778
You're supposed to wake me, you know.
I'm your commanding officer.

7
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:29,781
Oh! Korea!

8
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,580
- I'm not supposed to wake you.
- That's very kind of you, sir. It's really...

9
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:37,111
- I'm not interested in kindness.
- I've heard that, sir.

10
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,455
- I've had enough of your oversleeping.
- I just do it in the mornings.

11
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:44,621
Haven't I told you
not to sleep in your uniform?

12
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:48,326
Sir, the-the blankets itch.
There's things in 'em.

13
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,734
Nonsense. Did you sleep
in your clothes at home?

14
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:53,738
I was more
of a person there, sir.

15
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:56,138
- Let's go. I wanna get assembly started.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,371
- Where's your bugle?
- It's over there.

17
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,379
Where?

18
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,711
In the file cabinet under "B."

19
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:10,219
- And your clipboard's under "C," of course.
- No. "K."

20
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,817
- I'd like to know what you're
doing in this man's army.
- Me too, sir.

21
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:18,523
- All right, let's move.
- I'm moving, sir.

22
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,623
- Don't you brush your teeth in the morning?
- After breakfast.

23
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:25,694
- I want it done before!
- That way I can taste the food.

24
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,832
All right!
Gut in, chest out, chin up!

25
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,605
Let's set an example
for the camp, huh?

26
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:36,375
Hey-yup, hey-yup.
Rat-ta-ta-ta.

27
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:42,150
Hey-yup, hey-yup, hey-yup.

28
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:45,884
Hey-yup, hey-yup, hey-yup.

29
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,325
Hey-yup, hey-yup, hey-yup.

30
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,329
Hey-yup, hey-yup.

31
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:56,800
Hey-yup, hey-yup.
Hey-yuppy-pa-pa-pa.

32
00:02:56,869 --> 00:03:00,236
Pa-pa-pa-pa.
Pa-pa-pa-pa.

33
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:17,719
- Synchronize watches.
- Right.

34
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,724
- Sir?
- What is it?

35
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:23,159
I dropped my watch in the latrine,
and I really don't want it back.

36
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:27,859
- Just purse your lips and stand by.
- [Making Put-Put Sounds]

37
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,694
Coming up 0516, hack!

38
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,967
Hack!

39
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,975
Now!

40
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,472
## ["Assembly"]

41
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:00,859
- Twenty seconds.
- Check.
- Hack.

42
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:04,061
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, sir!

43
00:04:04,136 --> 00:04:06,331
Disgusting!

44
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:10,239
- Today's assembly took two
seconds longer than yesterday's.
- Major Burns?

45
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:13,676
- <i>Yes, Father?</i>
- I have us two seconds
quicker than yesterday.

46
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,714
Your watch must be off.

47
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:19,740
Hardly likely. It was given
to me by my bishop.

48
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,748
- Klinger!
- Sir!

49
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:26,257
How dare you wear that hat
while in uniform!

50
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,260
It's spring, sir!

51
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:31,922
I've warned you. That crazy stuff's
not going to get you out.

52
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:36,866
Next time I find you in a hat or a brassiere...
heh, heh... I'll promote you.

53
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:38,927
Major.

54
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,044
Don't forget to water
the flowers.

55
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:59,524
I'd like your strict attention, people,
please. I have some announcements.

56
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,060
Corporal O'Reilly.

57
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,823
Clipboard, sir!

58
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,328
A can of Danish ham
is missing from my office.

59
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:18,536
It was a personal ham sent to me
by my insurance man.

60
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:22,911
Unless the guilty party, whoever he
and/or she is, returns it immediately...

61
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:26,645
he, she or they will be
severely disciplined.

62
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,449
Two: The movie. In future,
those attending...

63
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:33,652
- will stand at attention when
I arrive and again when I leave.
- <i>[Mulcahy] Sir?</i>

64
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,627
May I pose
a hypothetical question?

65
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:40,927
- Uh, yes, Father.
- Suppose you leave in
the middle of the picture?

66
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,099
Uh, well,
we're working on that.

67
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:50,540
We'll let you know
by the end of the week.

68
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:54,101
- Three: Scrub room detail.
- <i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>

69
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:05,448
Stop, please.

70
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:10,325
Here we are. This is good. On the corner
of 42nd Street and Filth Avenue.

71
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:13,991
- Captain!
- No man calls me that and lives.

72
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,432
<i>Captain Pierce.! Officers</i>
<i>returning from leave...</i>

73
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,198
are supposed to check in with the
commanding officer upon their return!

74
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:22,035
Hello, honey. I'm home.

75
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:27,683
- What's the tab, Melvin?
- Ten bucks, American.

76
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:32,718
Here's 20. Buy yourself a new bicycle seat
before you get hemorrhoids.

77
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:37,020
- Thanks, Joe!
- Consider it a gift from a man
who has everything.

78
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,026
Captain Pierce!

79
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:44,360
For you, Frank.
It's a MacArthur doll.

80
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,197
Wind him up and he returns
from anywhere.

81
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,568
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- Pierce! Stop!

82
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,938
<i>[Margaret] He's defying your authority.</i>
<i>The whole company's laughing at you.</i>

83
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,977
Oh, I'll handle that.

84
00:06:56,045 --> 00:07:00,243
Company, dismissed!
Blow them away, Corporal.

85
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,518
## [Off-Key Bugling]

86
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:32,003
Hawkeye? Hey!
Hawkeye? Hey, Hawkeye?

87
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:35,847
Just one note, Radar, and I'll show you
a new way to play that thing.

88
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,318
- No, I wasn't gonna... Listen.
- Shh.

89
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:41,254
Softly, Radar.
Talk in small letters.

90
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:43,621
I have the Mount Rushmore
of hangovers.

91
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:47,753
Six aspirin companies are bidding
for my head. But I wanna tell you folks...

92
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,357
- Ah, yes, sir. Ah...
- You ever had a mouthful of cotton, Radar?

93
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,163
No, sir. We were vegetarians.
Listen...

94
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:58,036
I think I'll have my breakfast in here.
Soap could only improve it.

95
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,940
We couldn't reach you in Tokyo.
We tried for 24 hours.

96
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,003
That was the idea. I was on R-and-R.
Resting and recreating.

97
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,449
- We couldn't find you anyplace.
- I was with an unlisted geisha.

98
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:13,352
She did the mile in ten minutes
and eight seconds and never left my back.

99
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:16,585
I just wanted you to know we couldn't
reach ya. And we really tried.

100
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,026
<i>What'd you need me for? You had</i>
<i>Frank Burns and trusty Trapper John</i>...

101
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:23,861
champion of the oppressed
and molester of registered nurses.

102
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:28,336
He's gone, Hawkeye. He got his orders.
He's been shipped stateside.

103
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:32,500
- What?
- Trapper's gone. He got his orders.

104
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,747
Trapper went home?

105
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:43,842
- Yeah, or he's on his way.
- What the hell are you
talking about? How? When?

106
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,320
- He found out about three days ago.
- Why didn't you call me?

107
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,823
I said we tried!

108
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:54,027
- I can't believe it.
- Neither could he.

109
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:58,430
He got drunk for two days,
and then he ran naked through
the mess tent with no clothes on.

110
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,832
[Chuckles]

111
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:02,768
How could he leave
without saying good-bye?

112
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:05,534
He waited around
as long as he could.

113
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:07,542
No note? A letter?
Nothing?

114
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,078
Uh, no.

115
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,912
Nothing?

116
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
Well, he did say that
I should give you something, but, uh...

117
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,917
What? What-what-what-what?
What-what-what?

118
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:22,321
- Ah, gee, I can't.
- What?

119
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:26,919
[Sighs] Okay, but just remember
this was his idea.

120
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:36,164
- How long ago did he leave?
- Couple hours. He's taking
an early plane out of Kimpo.

121
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:38,365
- Today? This morning?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,839
No! Aw, gee!

123
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:52,447
<i>I don't mind the disrespect behind my back.</i>
<i>It's the "in front of people"that hurts.</i>

124
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,512
I wish Pierce had gone
and Mclntyre had stayed.

125
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,388
- Oh, Frank, have you forgotten?
- Hmm?

126
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,089
The time Mclntyre sedated you
and shaved every bit of hair off your body.

127
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:06,430
He's still better than Pierce. God only knows
how he carried on in Tokyo.

128
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,595
- I'm sure.
- <i>Oh, Margaret.</i>

129
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:12,573
Margaret, whatever happened to good
old meat-and-potatoes Christianity?

130
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,768
Whatever happened
to Aimee McPherson?

131
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:17,778
Poor soul went up in her plane
and was never heard from again.

132
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,780
Frank, that was Amelia Earhart.

133
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,975
Oh, yeah.

134
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:26,454
Well, there's still a few giants
left in this old world.

135
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:30,652
Do you think it'd be all right if I took a pen
and wrote in a bold, military hand...

136
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:35,629
- "To Frank, with eternal gratitude. Doug."?
- I do not.

137
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:40,032
Oh, gee, Margaret!
Ever since I've been commanding officer,
you don't let me do anything.

138
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:42,798
- Frank?
- It's about time you checked in.

139
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,897
I'm checking out. I'm going
to Kimpo to say good-bye to Trapper.

140
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:49,432
You're not going anywhere.
And stop leaking on my desk!

141
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:52,537
Frank, I lived with the guy for over a year.
He's my best friend.

142
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:54,514
You're exaggerating
his importance.

143
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,178
- He was very important to you too, Frank.
- Says who?

144
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:02,383
For over a year he kept me
from killing you. See you in two hours.

145
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,825
Pierce, we cannot be caught
with our complement down.

146
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:09,853
Listen, Mrs. First Lady, I checked.
We've only got two patients in post-op.

147
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:12,423
A nurse who was bitten on
her nameplate by Sergeant Niles...

148
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,799
and Sergeant Niles
with a broken jaw.

149
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:18,703
- Papers just came through
on Captain Hunnicutt, sir.
- Who?

150
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,708
Captain Mclntyre's replacement.

151
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,210
He's due at Kimpo within the hour.
Permission granted to go pick him up?

152
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,508
Permission granted, Corporal.

153
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:27,674
Oh. Sorry, Major.

154
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,913
Hmm? Oh, it's all right, Major.
Permission granted, Corporal.

155
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:33,079
Thank you, Major. Major.

156
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:35,089
<i>[Frank]</i>
<i>Why are you wet too?</i>

157
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:38,149
Uh, must be something
in the water, sir.

158
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:40,593
Take it off.
First, get into a dry uniform.

159
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:43,324
- Rats ate it.
- Oh, Lord.

160
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:46,731
Request permission

Wonderful qualifications.

- Is that a very selective fraternity?
- Very! They blackballed me.

167
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,385
- Oh, Frank.
- They insisted on double-breasted
tuxedos. I didn't have one.

It's a temporary loss of nerve function.
I've got him sedated now.

Professor Jerry Colonna.

320
00:22:03,804 --> 00:22:07,171
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

321
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:13,641
Ohhh! There's
real grape flavor in this.

322
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:16,342
Tough it out, cowboy.

323
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,749
Why don't you let me
stand outside, Hawkeye?

324
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,753
Hawkeye.
Why Hawkeye?

325
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,153
That's from
<i>The Last of the Mohicans.</i>

326
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:27,593
My father was crazy about that book.
He was crazy about Indians.

327
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:30,153
My grandfather used to sell them
whiskey and hors d'oeuvres.

328
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:33,029
<i>[Jet Engine Roaring]</i>

329
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:36,793
Feel like you just stepped
into a time machine?

330
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,704
Two months ago,
I'm in residency in Sausalito.

331
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,504
Little house in Mill Valley,
Peggy's eight months pregnant.

332
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:44,601
And they draft me.

333
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,239
Five weeks' training
at Fort Sam Houston.

334
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:50,409
Bunch of doctors stumbling around
in the dark, totally lost.

335
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:53,112
Some idiot shooting live ammo
over your heads.

336
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:55,849
- American plan.
- Hawkeye?

337
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:59,359
- Huh?
- That colonel.

338
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,987
What colonel, Radar? There's enough
brass in here to make a spittoon.

339
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:05,089
Over there at 8:00.
He keeps staring at me.

340
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:09,159
He's probably crazy about you.
Go ahead, B. J.

341
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,761
Then one night, Peggy and I
are at the Top of the Mark.

342
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,672
Her first night out
since having the baby.

343
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:18,838
- We go home. Our baby-sitter,
Norma Jean, says there's a message.
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

344
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,211
- Norma Jean?
- Mm-hmm.

345
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:24,683
- Eighteen? Oooh!
- Sixteen.

346
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:29,018
The message? "In two days,
report to Travis to ship out."

347
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:32,592
Next thing I know,
here I am.

348
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:38,125
- Hawk? He's coming over here.
- Huh?

349
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,167
- Play hard to get.
- Don't horse around.

350
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,699
- Boys.
- <i>Sir.</i>
- <i>Colonel.</i>

351
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:49,607
You all know this is
an officers' club, don't you?

352
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,668
I'm a captain,
plainclothes division.

353
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:56,615
Uh-huh. Corporal's stripes
and captain's bars?

354
00:23:56,684 --> 00:24:01,383
That's a new directive
from the pentagon, Colonel.
That's out of G-2 and G-3...

355
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:04,447
<i>making a G-5 combined</i>
<i>officers op-tech glitch.</i>

356
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:08,052
We're experimenting with a new rank:
Corporal captain.

357
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:12,065
<i>We're here making a survey.</i>
<i>Want to see if everybody likes it.</i>

358
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:15,125
Uh, asking everybody in Seoul.

359
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:17,636
- Coleman Hawkins, right?
- Right.

360
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,969
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

361
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:24,102
- Put down one "no." One against.
- Right.

362
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,272
One negative corporal captain.

363
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:29,908
Thank you, Colonel. We really
appreciate your help in this.

364
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:34,779
No sir.
I don't like it at all.

365
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,914
He doesn't like it at all.

366
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,189
Play it again, Sam.

367
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:46,495
Another Nehi. Gee, if I get gas,
nobody's ever gonna believe I'm an officer.

368
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:50,401
Radar, President Truman gets gas.
They just don't print it in the papers.

369
00:24:50,471 --> 00:24:52,405
What's the 4077 like?

370
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:55,840
Meatball surgery.
Nothing pretty.

371
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,609
But once we get a casualty to our front door,
his chance of survival is 97.8%% .

372
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:04,879
- That says a lot for the staff.
- It's a good bunch.

373
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:08,353
You missed two of the greatest
guys in the world though.

374
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:11,585
Henry Blake was our C.O.

375
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,457
Henry was okay, from the navel
out in every direction.

376
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,758
He sure was.

377
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:22,625
Henry never made it home.

378
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:27,197
And I just missed Trapper John, the guy you're
replacing, by ten minutes. Ten minutes!

379
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:30,107
- We tried to call you.
- You sure he didn't leave
a message or anything?

380
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:34,443
No. Just what I gave you.
And please don't ask for another one.

381
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:37,973
Listen. Major Burns is waiting for us.
That's our C.O. Now.

382
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:41,487
Bottom of the barrel.

383
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:44,581
Major Burns.
Major Frank Burns.

384
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:48,116
Everybody calls him Ferret Face.
That'll give you an idea
how devoted we are to him.

385
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:53,394
- Is he a good surgeon?
- With the same light touch
as a German jazz band.

386
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:57,460
Number one nurses though.
And a good young chaplain.
You'll be bunking with me.

387
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,065
- Not too much snoring, I hope.
- Only when I'm awake.

388
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,737
All you really have to worry about is getting
me in my coffin before the sun comes up.

389
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:06,746
Fair enough.

390
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:10,079
Well, I guess we'd better start
thinking about how we're gonna
get back to camp, huh?

391
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,643
- We'll have the bill, my good man.
- $1.20.

392
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:18,158
Ahhh. Pay him,
Corporal Captain.

393
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:23,458
- I only got about 70 cents.
- A big promotion like that,
they didn't give you a raise?

394
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,499
This one's on me.

395
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,799
You play poker, Doctor?

396
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:34,705
- I'm not very good.
- Neither am I.

397
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:44,917
General.

398
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,919
[Gasps]

399
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:55,689
Look, Radar, our jeep!

400
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:57,697
- It's a general's jeep!
- No, no, no.

401
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:00,165
What they've done, in order
to get into the officers' club...

402
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,327
they put a general's flag on our jeep.

403
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:05,065
- It's not!
- I can prove it. Test me.

404
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:09,098
- It's olive drab, right? Made in Detroit?
- They all say that.

405
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:12,873
Mud underneath? Four seats
that can reduce your behind to tears?

406
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,745
- Yeah, but...
- They didn't fool me for a minute.

407
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:20,480
- Throw your stuff in the back, B. J.
- Listen, you've been drinking. I drive.

408
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:22,954
All right. Deal.

409
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,116
Next stop, Bed Bug City!

410
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:27,683
Take this thing.

411
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,821
Okay, Radar, follow
the yellow brick road.

412
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:58,354
I'd like that worked into
next Sunday's sermon, Father,
if you can possibly manage it.

413
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,588
"Strength through obedience."

414
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,392
The discipline of this unit,
the lack of respect, is disgraceful!

415
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:08,299
I've had notes stuffed in my suggestion box
that would curl your dickey, Father.

416
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:10,929
These lads are under
terrific stress, Major.

417
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,974
They are? What about
the stress of command?

418
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:19,604
I'm running the hospital, the staff,
the supplies, looking right.

419
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,875
I have one Korean,
a college graduate...

420
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,543
who does nothing but keep my boots
shined at all times.

421
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:28,645
It costs me three cigarettes
a day, but it's worth it.

422
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:33,022
- I'll look forward to next Sunday, Father.
- I look forward to all of them.

423
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:35,220
I don't get you.

424
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,060
- Major Burns. Father.
- Major.

425
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,663
Did you give permission
that I didn't know about...

426
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:46,672
- for Captain Pierce to leave this camp?
- I certainly did not!

427
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,731
- Well, he's not anywhere to be found.
- Nowhere?

428
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:50,743
- That's right!
- Have you looked everywhere?

429
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:54,076
Obviously I've looked everywhere if
I know that he's not anywhere or nowhere!

430
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:57,845
- I'm sure it can all be explained.
- Keep your nose out of this!

431
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:01,547
- Frank!
- Oh. Sorry, Father. Sorry, Mother.

432
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:03,954
Margaret.

433
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,868
Hey! I lost my hat!
I lost my hat!

434
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:24,274
Your cookies will be next.

435
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:28,475
- Holy Toledo! It's the same M.P.!
- I told them to wait.

436
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:31,746
- Why'd you do that?
Oh, you didn't do that!
- I'm just joking.

437
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,413
- Well, this ain't funny.
- That's the trick, Radar.

438
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:39,090
You sure put in a long day,
Lieutenant.

439
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,957
A lot of infiltrators
on the road.

440
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:44,930
Yeah. They sure give the war
a bad name.

441
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:49,697
There was no room for him at the 121 st,
so we're taking him back to the 4077.

442
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,068
He can drive now?

443
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,336
It's good therapy.
This is Dr. Hunnicutt.

444
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:58,003
- Hunnicutt?
- <i>[B.J.] Yo.</i>

445
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:02,378
Specialist. We flew him in
for his operation.

446
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:05,577
Soon as we get back,
he's gonna... get on his nerves.

447
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:07,944
And he can drive now?

448
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,308
We put a temporary filling
in his ear.

449
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,489
- Different.
- Different?

450
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:24,891
Different jeep.
The jeep is different!

451
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:28,362
Oh! Yes! Yeah.
Sharp eye, Lieutenant. Good.

452
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:32,663
Yes, this different jeep
is definitely a different jeep.

453
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:37,696
We picked it up in Seoul. It was stolen
from our C.O. [Chuckles]

454
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,708
What's his name?

455
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:42,677
Major Burns.
Major Frank Burns.

456
00:30:42,746 --> 00:30:45,476
- Medicine's answer to longevity.
- <i>Frank Burns.</i>

457
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:47,641
Or Ferret Face.
He answers to both.

458
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:53,979
- This is weird.
- <i>[Radar Muttering]</i>

459
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:56,150
[Muttering]

460
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:58,660
[Shouting]

461
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:01,697
Move out!

462
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:38,823
Stop up ahead, Radar.
Stop!

463
00:31:42,005 --> 00:31:45,099
- Will you stop that! Stop!
- What's going on?

464
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:48,110
They're making sure the field
is okay for farming.

465
00:31:48,178 --> 00:31:52,945
<i>The daughters are checking for land mines.</i>
<i>If the girls survive, it's safe for the ox.</i>

466
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:55,382
[Speaking Korean]

467
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:00,248
<i>[B.J.] There are live mines</i>
<i>in that field?</i>

468
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:04,123
<i>I say we don't find out.</i>
<i>Hey.! Stop it.!</i>

469
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:08,489
- <i>Chung-ji.</i>
- <i>Chung-ji.!</i>

470
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:14,870
<i>Chung-ji.!</i>

471
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:18,499
- Who's the father? Are you the father?
- [Korean]

- <i>He told 'em to go ahead</i>
<i>and not pay no attention to ya.</i>
- <i>Is he cra</i>z<i>y?</i>

473
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,276
Listen to me! How can you do this?
You know what you're doing?

474
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,283
U-san! <i>That's what you are.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

475
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,649
That's in your own language.
<i>U- san.</i> That's what you are!

476
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,689
- What?
- You just called him an umbrella.

00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:36,122
- What? L... What's the word...
- <i>[Explosion]</i>

478
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:42,662
Radar! How are you

479

<i>Are you cra</i>z<i>y? Come back here.!</i>
- <i>[B.J.] O'Reilly.!</i>

480
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,927
- Be careful!
- How are you gonna get out again?

481
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:52,532
- <i>[Hawkeye] Radar.!</i>
- Come on, follow me. Hold on to me.

482
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:56,443
- <i>Put your feet in the same spot.</i>
- Watch it! Come back the way you went in.

483
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:59,675
<i>[Hawkeye] Straight.</i>
<i> Just come straight toward us.</i>

484
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,273
<i>[B.J.]</i>
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

485
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:04,013
Be careful!

486
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:06,521
- <i>[Hawkeye] Come straight, Radar.!</i>
- <i>That's it, easy, easy.</i>

487
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:13,991
Oh! Easy.

488
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:16,998
- Fragments in her leg. Shock.
- I guess the army's got a few more of these.

489
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:20,763
- Get her in the jeep, will ya?
- Holy cow!

490
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:26,598
- Hey, hey! Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

491
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:31,943
We can't take... No, no.
The ox does not ride for free.

492
00:33:32,015 --> 00:33:36,349
- Radar, tell 'em. No ox, no ox.
- Right. No ox! No ox!

493
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,580
You stay here.

494
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:40,589
- [Korean]
- What? What?

495
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:43,182
- He says there's a hospital up the road.
- Okay. Stay, stay.

496
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,284
[Speaking Korean]

497
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,921
Hang on.

498
00:33:47,997 --> 00:33:51,330
- You've got a lot of nerve, fella!
- That was very brave, Radar.

499
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:55,098
What?

500
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:57,196
[Hawkeye]
Running into a mine field.

501
00:33:57,273 --> 00:34:00,401
[Radar]
Did I run into a mine field?

502
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:03,741
Boy, that was brave.

503
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:07,271
<i>There's a new officer coming in,</i>
<i>and I want this place spotless, Corporal.</i>

504
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,217
First impressions
are lasting impressions.

505
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:13,050
Cleanliness is next to Godliness.
My mother says that.

506
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:15,955
Why bring her into it?
I never even met your mother.

507
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:19,358
- What are those earrings doing in your ears?
- Just hanging there, sir.

508
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:22,125
- Take them off!
- Yes, sir!

509
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:25,463
You, uh, got anything
crazy on under your clothes?

510
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:28,993
Nothing crazier than you got
under yours, sir.

511
00:34:29,072 --> 00:34:31,768
Get rid of these
filthy nudist magazines!

512
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:36,803
[Whistles] Hey, I thought
they were strictly volleyball.

513
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,404
- They play croquet and everything.
- Look at these socks!

514
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:42,212
Boots covered with blood.
Animals!

515
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:45,721
Here's some people clipping hedges.
That could be dangerous.

516
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:49,019
Get on with it.
Throw those away.

517
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:53,722
"Girl phoning." Wonder what
a naked girl sounds like on the phone.

518
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:56,629
- <i>Klinger.!</i>
- Yes, sir!

519
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:06,371
<i>[Frank's Voice]</i>
<i>Beats me how some people treat this war</i>
<i>as if it were some kind of picnic...</i>

520
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:09,502
<i>when it's really a privilege</i>
<i>to be asked to serve in the army.</i>

521
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:12,912
<i>'Course it's notjust our army.</i>
<i>We're here with the U. N...</i>

522
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:17,715
<i>which I personally have nothing against,</i>
<i>except that it's full of foreigners.</i>

523
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:20,483
<i>Of course, it's what did in</i>
<i>your League of Nations.</i>

524
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:25,253
Are all the local hospitals
that awful, that primitive?

525
00:35:25,328 --> 00:35:27,819
They're about 100 years ahead
at being behind.

526
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:32,231
- Boy, the smell!
- Radar, watch the road.
I'll do the smelling.

527
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:36,032
- <i>[Banging Sound]</i>
- Oh! Oh, boy.

528
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:42,042
Oh, gee! I've never changed
a tire in my life!

529
00:35:42,111 --> 00:35:46,172
I'll get it. Give me a lug wrench.
I'll take off the spare.

530
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:48,183
I thought you used
your mother's car.

531
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,719
I did, but she
always changed the tires.

532
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:53,620
Wait a minute. You're a surgeon.
You'll wreck your hands.

533
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:55,680
So I'll become a bugler.

534
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:57,726
I come from
three generations of doctors.

535
00:35:57,794 --> 00:36:00,763
I swear to you,
I have never seen hospital
conditions like that.

536
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:06,702
What they lack in sanitation,
they make up for in poverty.

537
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:10,136
- <i>[Radar] Here come some locals.</i>
- <i>[Hawkeye] It's a semi-free country.</i>

538
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:12,902
- Oh, gee!
- What?

539
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:17,139
I left my bubble gum
in the other jeep.

540
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,181
Whose picture
was on the card?

541
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:21,978
- Rosalind Russell.
- We just won't tell her.

542
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:26,078
Oh, boy! That general
sure has tight lugs.

543
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:30,148
[Grunting] We're gonna get him in
for surgery one of these days.

544
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:40,402
Hi. What do you say?

545
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,234
Just taking our afternoon flat.

546
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:51,675
Nice to see you.
I just got in.

547
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,715
Wheel's coming off the ground.

548
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:56,547
- Good job, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.

549
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:00,912
Uh-oh, Andy.

550
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,034
Holy smoke.

551
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:15,195
What is it?

552
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:19,173
The Koreans all went into the woods.
They may be guerrillas, maybe.

553
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:22,302
Either that or they're
having a gang toidy.

554
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:27,645
We'd better get outta here. Let's be calm,
guys, with undertones of frantic.

555
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:30,743
Bring the spare, B. J.

556
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,981
Out of the way, Radar.
Move!

557
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:37,287
- They shoot at doctors?
- Doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs.
Anybody. Any movement.

558
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,227
- <i>[Rifle Shots]</i>
- And I'm about to have one.

559
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:44,759
- I think I hate this.
- You sure we need all four tires?

560
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:48,531
- <i>[Rifle Shots]</i>
- Get the thing to take the car down.

561
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:50,765
Jack it down.

- Radar, stop that. I, l...

563
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,104
Get away from me, will ya?
Is it down? Got it?

564
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,149
All right. Now just get these out.
Let's get outta here!

This is a general's jack!

568
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,527
- Salute it and get in!
- <i>[Rifle Shots]</i>

[Hawkeye]
Down! Keep down!

570
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:33,177
- Everybody all right?
- I've been better.

571
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,183
My legs are shaking.

572
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:37,811
- Do what you always do.
- Oh, yeah.

573
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:42,655
- Sedative?
- Chiclet.

574
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,886
You okay, B. J.?

575
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:48,124
Scared is closer. There's a bullet hole
in the seat right next to me.

576
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:50,427
Boy, that general
is gonna have a fit.

577
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:53,559
Why should he?
We fixed his flat, didn't we?

578
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,472
<i>[Vehicle Approaching]</i>

579
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,319
Anybody here from Maine?

- [Soldier] I'm from Vermont.
- Close, but no cigar.

581
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,022

- Watts.

- Yo!

583

- Ottumwa did its bit, Radar.
They sent you.

00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:55,733
- Now what?
- Mortars.

587
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,076
They can make you a tenor
in the boys' choir in two seconds.

<i>[Soldier] Where's that stuff coming from?</i>
<i>Anyone see it?</i>

<i>Gimme that radio.</i>

your medical bag.
- Yes, sir.

Hell no! You're staying here
with the rest of us. Chiclets!

600
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:44,520
- Here, sir.
- Bite on that. We're not
allowed to carry bullets.

601
00:40:44,593 --> 00:40:47,118
A little sulfa here.

- Yeah?

603

Have somebody
call in our choppers.

604

- Is everything else down there?
- Yeah. Just mortar fragments.

I don't feel anything, Doc.
I just feel numb.

I think the shelling's stopped.
[Coughing]

Probably just

Margaret, I'm going to train Hunnicutt

Yes. Give me a man when he's 28,

- Yes, dear?
