1
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:56,574
[O.R. Chatter]

2
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:59,649
[Hawkeye] Scissors.

3
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,549
[Hawkeye] Suture.

4
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:08,251
[B.J.] Probe.

5
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:10,919
[Hawkeye]
Remember, if you hit oil, we go halvsies.

6
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:14,303
- [B.J.] Just my luck. I struck bullet.
- Well, get the lead out.

7
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,301
- I'll take that, Captain.
- Huh?

8
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:18,533
This guy wanted it
for a souvenir.

9
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,075
I'm trying to save his life,
and he's saving shrapnel?

10
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:23,668
Why do these guys want to pick up
every hunk of junk they trip over?

11
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:26,340
Collecting junk is
America's favorite pastime.

12
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:29,145
Well, what's wrong with that?
It's fun and it's profitable.

13
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:32,210
My last patient had six dollars' worth
of North Korean metal in his butt.

14
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:35,451
- Great place to hide it.
- You know that Korean kid
Pierce is working on?

15
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:39,221
He was collecting brass in the minefields.
Probably making more money than I am.

16
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,024
Too bad there's such
a good market for it.

17
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:43,030
Oh, that's right.
Knock free enterprise.

18
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:46,226
Why do these people want to
take home mementos from this lousy war?

19
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:47,894
So they remember
what they're trying to forget.

20
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,029
I've got souvenirs
from every place I've been.

21
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:52,903
- Have you tried flea powder?
- My nephew's a sucker for souvenirs.

22
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:55,967
He takes trips so he can cover
his car windows with decals.

23
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:58,070
Now the nitwit can't
see where he's going...

24
00:01:58,147 --> 00:02:00,775
'cause his windows are all
covered with where he's been.

25
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:05,686
Frank.

26
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:09,383
Margaret, how nice of you to join me.
Is there anything I can do for you?

27
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,858
- Yes. Stop salivating and listen.
- It's oatmeal.

28
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:13,952
- I want my ring back.
- What ring?

29
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:17,465
What ring? The ruby ring I gave you
on our first anniversary.

30
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:21,629
You've been out in the sun too long.
You never gave me a ring,
ruby or any other kind.

31
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:24,673
- Frank!
- You never did!

32
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,073
Although if you had, you certainly have
your nerve crawling back for it now.

33
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:33,103
I'm not crawling, Frank. That happens
to be a precious family heirloom...

34
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:36,276
and now that you and I
are no longer... close...

35
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:38,411
I wish to give it
to Donald.

36
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,546
- Indian giver.
- Then you admit you have it.

37
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:43,056
I do not. I'm just
pointing out that, uh...

38
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,652
had you given it to me... as you seem
to think you did, and you didn't...

39
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,698
you'd be an Indian giver.

40
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:52,563
You once compared
the ruby to my lips.

41
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,966
That sounds like me, okay.
Must have been somebody else.

42
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,164
- There is nobody else like you, Frank.
- Margaret, l...

43
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,537
Watch it!

44
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:01,542
My heart belongs to another.

45
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,101
Let him have your heart.
I'll take what's left. I love you.

46
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:07,012
Frank, if you ever cared for me,
you'll return the ring.

47
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:10,074
I don't have it, Margaret.
I only wish I did.

48
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:15,215
We military men like keeping little
mementos of our battlefield conquests.

49
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,554
Then hold on to this.

50
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,567
Here's a pair of earrings, Klinger.
I had 'em designed just for you.

51
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:30,264
Huh? They're made out
of.45-caliber shells.

52
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,330
Anything over
.30 caliber is gauche.

53
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:35,741
[Chuckles]
Taste. You have taste. Gotta tell you.

54
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:40,111
All right. Here's something I know you're
gonna like. Not many men can wear this.

55
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:42,275
You ready?

56
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:45,445
The safety pins from
a hundred hand grenades.

57
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,547
Don't you have anything happy?
Whatever happened to rhinestones?

58
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:52,287
- Klinger, this is a war.
Nobody throws rhinestones.
- <i>[Boy] Mr. Stratton.</i>

59
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,295
Hey, Chang.

60
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,991
- Got some good junk. You're gonna like it.
- Let's see.

61
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:01,833
<i>Ah, that's junko.</i>
<i>No, there's nothing I, uh</i>...

62
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:05,032
- There's nothing I need.
- First-class junk. Look at brass.

63
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:08,167
No, no. You see, it's... it's a miss, kid.
It's no good.

64
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:10,734
All right. I'll give you
a buck for it. Here.

65
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:15,409
- Five bucks. Please?
- No. Two. Now beat it.

66
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:19,153
[Chuckles]
He beats me every time.

67
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:23,920
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Okay, what about the earrings?

68
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,722
Nah, I gotta give
my lobes a rest.

69
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,889
All right. Now this is you.
This is you.

70
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,628
An aluminum watchband.
The material came off a MiG.

71
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,636
Some other war.

72
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,300
Ah, boy.

73
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,380
Hey, Hawkeye, how'd you like
an aluminum bracelet for your wrist?

74
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,781
How'd you like a knuckle
sandwich for your mouth?

75
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:53,754
- Oh, come on, guys. A guy's gotta live.
- Shall we put it to a vote?

76
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:57,155
- Hey, what's eating you guys?
- What's eating us is you.

77
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,421
Because you insist on dealing
in that stuff...

78
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:02,396
I wound up working on one of
your eight-year-old garbage collectors.

79
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,932
I don't force those kids
to bring me this junk.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,934
They're go-getters.
They do it on their own.

81
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:10,062
- What choice do they have?
- They could go into law school or advertising.

82
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,972
- Even better, they could starve to death.
- <i>Aw, come off it.</i>

83
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,441
All I do is peddle
a few harmless souvenirs.

84
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:19,447
I mean, what I do is good
for the economy. I create jobs!

85
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,210
For the undertaker.

86
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:23,217
Boy, you guys really think
you're hot stuff...

87
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:25,480
because you're M.D.s
and I'm just a chopper pilot.

88
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:28,523
- Make that Pontius Pilate.
- Put it to music, Pierce.

89
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,683
Hey, soldier! [Whistles]
Hold up!

90
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,750
Have I got
a deal for you.

91
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:35,956
Souvenir hunting has been
a problem in every war.

92
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,192
Hannibal's men booby-trapped
their elephants' trunks.

93
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,235
They blew up every time
they went swimming.

94
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:42,736
- Isn't there anything that
can be done about this?
- Like what?

95
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:47,036
I don't know. Like if you catch anybody
selling this stuff, you park a tank on his chest.

96
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,942
I hope we can come up with
something a little less severe.

97
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:51,912
How 'bout a jeep?

98
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,471
You see? I'm guilty of buying
some of these trinkets myself.

99
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,610
- We all have to stop sometime.
- So what do you want me to do?

100
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:00,314
- Do what you do best. Scream at the troops.
- Holler on 'em.

101
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,651
That's easy.

102
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,714
- If that doesn't work...
- Park a tank on 'em.

103
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,419
Or a jeep.

104
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:08,088
We are in the midst
of an epidemic.

105
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:12,099
It's not the plague, not the chicken pox,
not the creeping crud.

106
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,659
It's the buying, selling and collecting
of war souvenirs.

107
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:17,967
And it's
getting people killed.

108
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,500
The enemy leave their booby-trapped pistols,
bayonets and helmets all over the place...

109
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:27,481
'cause they know some slaphappy G.I.
Will try to pick up that cockarocka...

110
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,211
and before he knows it
his nickname is "Lefty."

111
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:33,948
<i>On top of that, Korean kids</i>
<i>scavenge in the minefields...</i>

112
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,820
for brass to make ashtrays for us
to stick our butts in.

113
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:42,125
<i>So stop making a market for</i>
<i>a bunch of trash you don't need anyway.</i>

114
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:46,293
If you want a souvenir,
take yourself home in one piece.

115
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:49,860
Remember, somebody at home loves you.
Don't ask me why.

116
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,872
Any questions?

117
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,001
Yo! Does this mean you're prohibiting
the buying and selling of souvenirs?

118
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:58,706
I don't have that authority.
This is just friendly advice...

119
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,717
from the C.O. To the people
who serve under him, if you get my drift.

120
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:08,279
Any other questions?
Dismissed.

121
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,589
- Good try, Colonel.
- Yeah, you convinced me.

122
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:14,959
Oh, that's the trouble
with speeches. You wind up...

123
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,998
convincing your friends
and boring your enemies.

124
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:18,999
- <i>[Klinger] Colonel?</i>
- What?

125
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:21,001
- <i>Oh, Colonel!</i>
- Where'd that come from?

126
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,003
<i>Up here, sir.</i>

127
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,869
Heard your speech, Colonel,
and I loved it.

128
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:29,934
Thank you. Now what are you doing
sitting on top of that pole?

129
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,344
I'm pole-sitting, sir.
It's Section Eight time.

130
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:34,348
Klinger, you're the tops.

131
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,350
"What light through yonder
window breaks?"

132
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,909
It is the east,
and Klinger is the nuts.

133
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,455
Come down, Klinger,
before you hurt yourself.

134
00:07:41,523 --> 00:07:45,357
No, sir. I came up a soldier.
I'll come down a civilian.

135
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,793
One gust of wind,
you'll come down a pancake.

136
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:51,594
- I love 'em with maple syrup.
- Klinger, don't be a sap.

137
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,828
I'm not a sap. I'm crazy.

138
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:56,029
Who in his right mind
would climb a platform...

139
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:58,572
over a basketball hoop
in the middle of the night?

140
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,701
- Shimmy down, Klinger.
- This is where I make my stand.

141
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:06,441
- He's making it sitting down.
- I thought you were afraid
of high places, Klinger.

142
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:09,575
I'm desperate.
Send me back to Toledo.

143
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,778
He wants to go back to Toledo?
That is desperate.

144
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:15,414
- You keep saying crazy stuff
like that, you're halfway home.
- Does anybody want my opinion?

145
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,253
- No.
- I don't think so.

146
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,294
I'd chop the pole down.
[Laughs]

147
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:23,593
- That would open up the game to little guys.
- Ah, what a trio of schmoes.

148
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,463
Make that a duo.
[Chuckles]

149
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:29,800
- Adios.
- Just don't walk away. Can't you see I'm crazy?

150
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:32,965
Klinger, if I got rid of all
the crazies in this camp...

151
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,134
I'd be the loneliest
man in Korea.

152
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,610
I'm not coming down, sir.

153
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,978
In that case,
I have just one piece of advice for you.

154
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,609
When you're walking
guard duty tonight...

155
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,710
take very tiny steps.

156
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,822
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

157
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,827
My daughter is saying
complete sentences.

158
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,886
How old is she?

159
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:59,024
- Two.
- See, Frank? Don't give up.

160
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,831
- Someday you'll be saying complete sentences.
- Oh, hardy-har-har.

161
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,235
Keep trying, Frank.
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

162

- <i>Entre</i>z.

163
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:10,141
Pardon me, sirs. I'm looking
for Major Frank Burns.

164
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:12,737
Oh, I'm Major Burns.
What is it?

165
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:16,910
- Do you know a Corporal Thomas Hinton?
- No. I don't think so. Why?

166
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:20,580
He was dealing in Korean antiques
on the black market.

167
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:24,557
When we caught up with him last week,
he gave us a rundown of his customers.

168
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:27,720
Your name
was on that list.

169
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:30,094
He says you purchased
a bowl from him.

170
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:35,034
And it turned out to be an 800-year-old
celadon vase of the Koyou dynasty.

171
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,901
- It must have been somebody using my name.
- And your face.

172
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:41,170
- How could somebody use my face?
- How about for a doormat?

173
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:44,974
An 800-year-old vase.
Do you know how much it went for, Sergeant?

174
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,241
$27.75.

175
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:50,307
- What was it worth?
- It's priceless.

176
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:54,412
Really? Boy,
isn't that interesting.

177
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:58,357
The Koreans are anxious that their national
art treasures remain in the country.

178
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:00,918
- Ah.
- The U.S. Army supports that position.

179
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:03,794
I'm sure if Major Burns suddenly
remembers buying that vase...

180
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:06,197
- he'll be the first to deny it.
- Of course.

181
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:09,601
I hope you catch that ugly creep
that's been using my face.

182
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,367
Yes, sir. So do I.

183
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,534
- Thank you, sir.
- Call again.

184
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:20,939
Wow, a priceless vase bought for $28.
What a shrewd buy that was.

You trying to drown your sorrows?

190
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:37,565
- No. Just taking them out for a little swim.
- What's the trouble?

191
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:40,430
I'm sore at a friend...
who's no friend.

192
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:42,436
Makes sense to me.

193
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,529

194

- And so are you.

Stratton, what are you
still doing here?

200
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,325
Didn't Colonel Potter
tell you to... to shove off?

201
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:09,090
He didn't tell me to shove off.
He just bored me with a lot of bad advice.

202
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:13,123
You know something, Stratton...
and don't take it personally...

203
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:15,931
I think you stink.

204
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,268
Hey, what's
the matter with you?

205
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,968
I'm just trying to conduct
a little free, honest enterprise.

206
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:23,476
- Isn't that what we're fighting about?
- You know, Stratton...

207
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:26,654
you call yourself a businessman,
but you got a very limited inventory.

208

But the real demand
is for arms, legs and feet.

211
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,528
I got some customers for you
right here in post-op.

212
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:40,328
You created a demand.
Why don't you just start supplying it?

213
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,335
Not funny, Pierce.
Real bad taste.

214
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:45,804
What are you wasting your time
talking to this creep?

215
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,365
- If my fiance, Donald Penobscott...
- Lieutenant Colonel.

216
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,241
- Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott...
- Of West Point.

217
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:57,012
That's him. If he were here,
which he isn't, you know what he'd do?

218
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,644
- Buy an ashtray?
- Negative.

219
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,917
He'd take this bum
by the neck, and he'd deck him!

220
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,924
Ow!

221
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,888
It's a good thing
Donald isn't here.

222
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:13,024
Yeah.
Stratton could get hurt.

223
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,339

Who were you expecting,
"Shipwreck" Kelly?

228
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:37,323
- What are you doing up there, Klinger?
- I'm catching cold.

229
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,689
Well, can't you
do that down here?

230
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,558
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Colonel.

231
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,394
Did you know Klinger
was up the basketball pole?

232
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,730
Yeah, he's
a human foul shot.

233
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,770
You ready to land,
Mr. Lindbergh?

234
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:52,271
Are you ready to send me
back home to Toledo?

235
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,707
- No can do, Klinger.
- No can land, Colonel.

- [Sneezes]
- Bless you.

- Thank you.
- He's catching a cold.

238
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,873
Sounds like it.
He's just being stubborn.

239
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,679
I'm not stubborn. I'm crazy.
Give me a Section Eight.

240
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,879
You're not even
half crazy, Klinger.

241
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:12,722
So make it a Section Four. Send me as far
as San Francisco. From there I'll hitch.

242
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,889
I'll settle for a Section Two.
Send me to Honolulu. From there I'll swim.

It could've killed you.

248
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,801

That's why it's lucky.

Okay.

For two years.
To help support our family.

259
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:18,016
And when he feels better,
he's gonna go back into the minefields?

260
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:21,584

321
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,983
Leave it to Drake to promote
that sort of nonsense.

322
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,462
- Who's Drake?
- C.O. Of the 8063rd.

323
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,658
I can see his
fine hand in this.

324
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:56,032
Little bits of tawdry glory
are all that matter to him.

325
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,970
I still remember the day
he swallowed 23 goldfish...

326
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,769
to break the old record
at Camp Grant.

327
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:06,006
To see him strutting around, you'd have
thought he'd licked the kaiser single-handed.

328
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,049
- What was the old record?
- Twenty-two.

329
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,949
- I was sick as a dog for a week.
- [Laughs]

330
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,520
Klinger!

331
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,891
Colonel. I give up.
You win. I'm coming down!

332
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,658
Hold it!
How long's it been so far?

333
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,100
About two days.

334
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,329
In hours.
How long in hours?

335
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,372
About 48.

336
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,237
Great, Klinger.
You're more than halfway there.

337
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,936
How's that, sir?

338
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,844
You've got just 46 hours
and 19 minutes to go...

339
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,508
to break the MASH
pole-sitting record.

340
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,348
Forty-six hours
and 19 minutes?

341
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,581
You mean you want me
to stay up here, sir?

342
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,589
You can do it
on one wing, Lindy.

343
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,319
But, Colonel, it's cold
as a witch's elbow.

344
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,191
I'll give you your choice.
You can stay up there...

345
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,528
or come down here
and swallow 24 goldfish.

346
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,728
Did you say
24 goldfish, sir?

347
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,737
The first 18 are easy.

348
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,899
Would you send up
my flannel nightie...

349
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,637
and my genuine
imitation fox stole?

350
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,979
- Is he gonna be okay?
- What are you doing here, Stratton?

351
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,882
Hey, white flag, okay?
I got something for the family.

352
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:22,012
It's a gift. Fifty bucks.

353
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,023
- No, no. Take it.
- Thank you.

354
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,457
Yeah, this little guy
is one of my best suppliers.

355
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:29,087
I figure a guy in business shouldn't
forget something like that.

356
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:33,759
Oh! Hey, Chin, you hurry up and get out
of here, and I'll take you up in my whirlybird.

357
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,098
You know...
[Imitates Helicopter Whirring]

358
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,798
If I were you,
I wouldn't fly with him.

359
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:40,965
You know?
[Whirring]

360
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,610
Got something
for you. Here.

361
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,147
Oh, great.
Perfect gift for a child.

362
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:51,651
Well that's how good this is.
It looks like a real Chinese pistol, huh?

363
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,652
Clever!

364
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,314
Very. Can you get me
a cigarette lighter that fires bullets?

365
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,359
I got a brother-in-law in Chicago
that can get as many of these as I need.

366
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,451
What does a kid need
with a cigarette lighter?

367
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,861
Well, when he quits smoking,
he can always sell it.

368
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,662
- Stratton, uh, come on outside.
- Yeah, we wanna talk to you.

369
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,668
- What about?
- Your future.

370
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,795
Hold it. If you guys
are gonna get rough...

371
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:15,467
- I can get you in a lot of trouble.
- Come on. Let's go.

372
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:20,615
This gonna be a fair fight,
or are you gonna do two against one?

373
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,988
We're not gonna hit you.
We want you to disappear.

374
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,459
- I got a right to be here.
- You got nerve.

375
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:28,827
You think because you slipped the family
a couple bucks, that gets you off the hook?

376
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,832
Oh, you people
just don't appreciate me.

377
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,925
The other guy that had
this route was heartless.

378
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,368
One of his kids got hurt,
he'd just send flowers.

379
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:38,566
I'm glad to hear the business was
taken over by a humanitarian.

380
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:40,609
Why don't you face facts?
There's nothing...

381
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:43,202
you say can change me,
and nothing you do can stop me.

382
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,680
- Stratton, you're a sick man.
- [Chuckles] That's one man's opinion.

383
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:48,683
Make that two.

384
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:51,276
I'm worried about this man, Doctor.
He looks anemic.

385
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:53,345
- Look at the color of his skin.
- Pallid.

386
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:56,119
- <i>[Hawkeye] Very white.</i>
- There's nothing wrong with me.

387
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:58,285
- Low blood count.
- He could pass out up there.

388
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,625
- Hey, cut it out.
- This is serious.

389
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:02,528
- I can't let this man fly.
- I agree.

390
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,693
Not fly? Hey, wait a minute.
Wait. Hold it. You can't do that.

391
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:08,362
- Actually, we can.
- We'll have to give him a blood test.

392
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:10,929
- I have a feeling he'll flunk.
- I think you're right.

393
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,941
Hey, hold it.
Hold it. Hold it!

394
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:17,744
I got an announcement to make.

395
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,748
I just went
out of the business.

396
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,750
I think
he's getting better.

397
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:25,219
- Okay, but I keep flying, right?
- Right.

398
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:28,018
Oh, boy, you guys are crazy.
You're really kidding yourselves.

399
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,754
Fine, you got me. Great. But there's
a thousand other guys hustling out there.

400
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,887
What are you gonna do,
change the world?

401
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:37,922
- No, just our little corner of it.
- So long, Stratton. Take a walk.

402
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:42,162
You know I sold
a thousand of these?

403
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:44,001
It's my last pair.

404
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:49,136
[Chuckles]
At least I got a souvenir.

405
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:52,442
Klinger, wake up!
You broke the record!

406
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:55,951
- [Snorts] Huh?
- <i>You did it!</i>

407
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,010
Yeah?

408
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:00,021
I got the record?

409
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:03,923
And a three-day pass in Tokyo
whenever you're ready to shove off.

410
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:07,258
I'm ready.

411
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,322
I got the record.
[Chuckles]

412
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,097
I got the record.
I got the record.

413
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,704
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Don't thank me. You've earned the pass.

414
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:23,837
I meant for making me
stay up there.

415
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:26,108
- I set a record.
- That's right!

416
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:28,878
Yeah, but someday
some kid will come along and break it.

417
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:32,547
In an imitation fox stole
and army shoes? Not a chance.

418
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,921
- Hey, that's right! I set a record.
- [Laughs]

419
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:40,128
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Who is it?

420
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:42,391
- <i>[Margaret] It's me!</i>
- Margaret?

421
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:45,730
Come in. What did I do?
I mean, what can I do for you?

422
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:47,895
You owe me $15.

423
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,939
- What for?
- For this.

424
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,736
Oh, you got your ring back.
Now stop picking on me!

425
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,800
- Here, look.
- It's beautiful.

426
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:57,505
Look inside.
Read the inscription.

427
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,810
I can't make it out.
I don't have my glasses.

428
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:02,350
You don't wear glasses, Frank.

429
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:05,717
- Maybe I can borrow some?
- I'll read it to you.

430
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:08,689
- "To Louise. Love, Frank B."
- I can explain that.

431
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:11,591
So can I. You were gonna
give <i>my</i> ring to <i>your</i> wife?

432
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:15,529
It only looks that way.
The engraver made a mistake. It's a typo.

433
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:18,089
I want it removed.

434
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:22,194
<i>You can give me</i>
<i>$ 15 or 15 teeth.</i>

435
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:26,801
Will you take a check?
