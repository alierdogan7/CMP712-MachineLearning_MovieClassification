00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:49,287
<b>This film is based on a real story.</b>

2
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:09,954
On August 15, 1945, Korea was liberated from Japan. The 38th Parallel set the barrier between the Communist North, and the U.S. held South.

3
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:24,900
June 25, 1950 marks the beginning of the Korean War. It was the first full-scale conflict since WW2, and the region around Pohang saw fierce clashes between South Korea's 3rd Infantry Division and North Korean forces.

4
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:41,377
For the past 40 days, South Korean forces have only been retreating. There is nowhere else to fall back, all they can do now is wait for the arrival of the Allies in the Nakdong River.

5
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:14,287
August 8, 1950
 
1
00:03:59,322 --> 00:03:59,989
Hey, hey! 

2
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,574
You over there.

3
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,412
Take this ammo to Giganpo's position.

4
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,372
What?

5
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,123
People on the roof above!

7
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,127
Captain

8
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,921
There's been 3758 strikes. 

9
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,255
How is it on that side?

10
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,677
25 pointers, I need assistance immediately.

11
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,845
Fire! Fire!

12
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,530
To the front!

13
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,085
How many are left?

14
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:36,961
It's the last one.

15
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,007
Captain

16
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,967
What happened to the artillery support?

f17
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,926
They're back in the rear.

18
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,139
Just fall back! That's an order!

19
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,974
It's too late, it's all over!

20
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,684
Kang Daewi, listen to me!

21
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,186
We can do it, Captain!

22
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,030
Hey, Kim Jun Seop. 
-Yes.

23
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,864
Take three support plantoons.

24
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,656
Yes, sir.

25
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,617
No matter what happens, you have to keep going.
-Yes, sir.

26
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,618
Hey! Let's go!

27
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,203
Hey, Kim Jun Seop.

28
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,745
Yes.

29
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,538
Be careful.

30
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,725
We need a medic! A medic!

31
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,436
Don't run, hold your ground!

32
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,479
Hurry, medic! 

33
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,438
Over here!

36
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,599
You got the medic, right?!

37
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,702
More ammunition!

38
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,999
Reloading!

39
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,218
Fire! Fire!

40
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,495
I said run, not stand!

41
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:23,878
Here.

42
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,129
Stay behind.

43
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,276
Let's go!

44
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,335
Stick to the wall!

45
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,176
They're coming!

46
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,629
Reporting two platoons!

47
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,134
Captain, we've lost contact.

48
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,138
Try again.

49
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,889
Yes, sir!

50
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,748
Captain, Lee Myung Gook.

51
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,086
Still haven't ripped through them?

52
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,046
The rest have begun to retreat.

53
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,672
It will be taken soon.

54
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,760
It will only take five minutes for the 766th Vanguard Troops to win.

55
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,345
We'll start attacking Pohang.

56
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,057
Let this land be free!

57
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,850
Let this land be unified!

58
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,481
Kill everyone.

59
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,025
Charge!

60
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,988
Captain, please send reinforcements! We're being pushed back!

61
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,783
We're in trouble!

62
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,126
Charge!

63
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,00
Yes

64
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,382
Yes, that's right.

65
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,467
Commander

66
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:09,348
Nakdong River positions have moved to the front

67
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,475
according to Captain Wi's orders.

68
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,270
Hey, comrade Lee, 

69
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,105
why am I going there?

70
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,857
I'm going straight to Pohang.

71
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,485
It's an order from the Central Commander.

72
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,198
It's only a suggestions by amateur pencil pushers.

73
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,908
What do they know about war?

74
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,454
Are you ignoring his commands right now?

75
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,877
Comrade, who is in a higher position?

76
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,885
I'm asking who is in a higher position!

77
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,141
The top commander...

78
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,730
Since I left Pyongyang,

79
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,066
I am the top Commander.

80
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,987
Since August, all the orders for Busan 

81
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,282
have been directly from me.

82
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,455
Bugwan. 
-Sir!

83
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,583
We will take the 766th Vanguard Troops straight to Pohang.

84
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,060
What are you doing? Do it now!

85
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,730
If you cut off the bridge, the refugees will be blocked off.

86
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,899
Then what will we do?!

87
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,692
It's a direct order!

89
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,531
The medic has arrived, so no need to worry now.

91
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,905
We'll give you morphine, wait a little longer.

92
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:21,790
Move the corpse.

93
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:11,984
Can you hear me?

94
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,614
Can you hear me?

95
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,079
It looks like your hearing is gone.

96
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,300
Does it hurt?

97
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,057
What is your name?

98
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,689
You don't even know when you got hurt, do you?

99
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,865
I guess you don't want to talk.

100
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,054
How's Kim Jun Seop?

101
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:22,929
He's been killed.

102
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,974
Those bastards.

103
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,939
Why aren't you sending in support troops?

104
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,484
Why have you stopped supporting artillery?

105
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,026
Kang Daewi.

106
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,239
For the past 40 days, we've only been retreating.

107
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,949
I'm tired of retreating.

108
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,327
When were the allies supposed to arrive?

109
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,913
Where should we run to now?!

110
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,166
Do we go all the way to Busan?

111
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,001
Then should we go in the ocean afterwards?

112
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,835
Kang Seok, stop it now!

113
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,713
Leave him.

114
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,141
I know.

115
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,604
Seeing men killed right in front of your eyes,

116
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,272
I know it frustrates your heart.

117
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,611
There were no support troops left to send.

118
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,700
Artillery support fire was unavailable because the 4th unit was being wiped out.

119
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,201
It was a vicious fight.

120
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,622
We have three divisions

121
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,499
committed in the Nakdong River area.

122
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,502
Whether it's 5 divisions, 12 divisions, or 15 divisions,

123
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,004
I have to focus on the Nakdong River perimeter.

124
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,049
That is an order from the higher ups.

125
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,638
The Nakdong River battle is going to turn into a bloodbath.

126
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:51,184
We can no longer retreat or push back,

127
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,228
because this is our last line of defense.

128
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,235
Then where are the Pohang units supposed to be?

129
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:57,793
Attention!

130
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,962
The Hakdobyung group, move with the other groups!

131
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,049
Move quickly!

132
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,179
Move faster, guys! Let's go!

133
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,350
Were you by Kim Jun Seop's side when he died?

134
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:14,601
Yes.

135
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,240
What's your name?

136
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,784
Oh Jung Beom.

137
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,110
Catch!

138
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:08,572
Hey, nice work here!

139
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,739
What is it?

140
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,993
On the charge of attempted murder, that guy,

141
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,079
is heading to a juvenile jail center.

142
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,416
While he was heading to a juvenile jail center,

143
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,711
he said he wanted to fight since 

144
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:25,630
he's a student soldier too, but...

145
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,382
Do you want that kind of guy?

146
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,844
I don't know what else to do.

147
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,679
Particularly, this bastard.

148
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,978
He looks a little old.

149
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,607
You're sure he's a student?

150
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,108
He is.

151
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,862
There's a unit of students that are meeting over there.

152
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,155
Run over.

153
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,164
Don't worry about that guy.

154
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,250
Don't you dare run, you bastard!

155
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,672
His parents were killed by Communists.

156
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,343
That's why he hates it when you talk about communists.

157
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,804
Please sign this.

158
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,358
New HDB recruits, 68 people. 3 existing recruits, total of 71 people.

159
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,193
End of this group!

160
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,570
The first three, come forward.

161
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:50,340
Give an M1 rifle, with 250 rounds each 

162
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,132
to the new recruits

163
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
Right now?

164
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,557
From the left line, one person come forward at a time.

165
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,018
Next line!

166
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,105
New HDB recruits, find your places.

167
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:06,398
Move quickly!

168
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,660
This is so cool!

169
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,919
Men, from this point on, you are now all HDB troops.

170
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,424
HDB troops are divided into two sets.

171
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:38,763
The head commander will be Oh Jung Beom.

172
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:40,098
Excuse me!

173
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,058
What is it?

174
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,228
Why are you making him commander?

175
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,813
Do I hear an objection?

176
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,441
Captain, how about a vote for the position?

177
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,193
That's right. Let's act democratically.

178
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,154
Let's do an eating contest!

179
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,282
If it's an eating contest, then I have confidence too.

180
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,784
Be quiet! Do you think this is a joke?

181
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,245
A commander should have combat experience.

182
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,123
I'm sticking with Oh Jung Bum.

183
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:10,628
From now on, this place will be your position.

184
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,256
Right now, we have three divisions...

185
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,051
committed in the Nakdong area.

186
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:26,352
Are you saying you want us to defend this place?

187
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:28,438
Just us?

188
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,439
That's right.

189
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,108
Is there any reason to defend Pohang?

190
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,444
Pohang is a minor strategic base.

191
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,280
Then why don't we abandon Pohang?

192
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,242
Even though this place is not as important, if the enemies get through Nakdong River,

193
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,536
it's over.

194
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,664
According to the information we already have,

195
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:51,711
this place is relatively safe compared to the Nakdong area.

196
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,214
Oh, how long do we have to defend this place?

197
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,341
The allied forces will arrive on Wednesday.

198
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,259
Only until then.

199
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,763
Let's not go. Can we just not go?

200
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,933
It's an order from the upper command.

201
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,938
We... follow the orders we're given.

202
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,150
Excuse me. If...if...

203
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,986
the communists attack, what do we do?

204
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,155
What do you mean? We can just kill them all!

205
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,909
Hey man, you can't even shoot a gun, and you want to kill them?!

206
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,703
Shut up, I can learn!

207
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,832
I'm guessing we can't run?

208
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,583
Fight, fight until the end!

209
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:39,634
HDB troops are soldiers, are you not soldiers?

210
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,637
You are the country.

211
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,349
Believe in yourselves.

212
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:54,774
Here.

213
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:57,986
Your arm.

214
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,573
You need to take care of your wound.

215
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,458
Remember that.

216
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:33,897
The power supply. 

217
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,650
First turn it this way, then turn it on. Then afterwards, tune it.

218
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,487
Then after tuning, adjust the sound frequency.

219
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:42,780
Then match the sounds. 
 
220
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,032
What is this?

221
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,658
It's not the frequency, it's the power.

222
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,079
There's no time, I have to keep moving.

223
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,873
You're in charge.

224
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,508
Dae Wi Nim.

225
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:03,635
What?

226
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,973
Have some confidence.

227
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,809
If anything happens, you can contact me on the radio.

228
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,605
I can't be the top commander.

229
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,359
I've never even held a higher rank before.

230
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,614
Lead with your heart.

231
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,951
If you have a pure heart and good intentions,

232
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,452
everyone will follow you.

233
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:03,111
If you make them cross the river

234
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,988
it will take two days to get there.

235
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,740
18 hours more because of bridge damage.

236
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,909
Totaling to about three days.

237
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,996
The remaining boats will not be 

238
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,455
enough for everyone.

239
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,879
There are roads beyond those mountains,

240
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,840
it would take us half a day to get there.

241
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,009
But we might be ambushed there.

242
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,138
Comrade Commander,

243
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,016
Regardless of this,

244
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,601
should we just follow orders

245
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:38,313
and continue down Nakdong River?

246
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:44,068
This, Comrades, is why I say that theories are useless in the battlefield.

247
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,029
Think about it.

248
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,158
If the enemies have a safe crossing,

249
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,994
We're going to have to destroy it.

250
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,875
Is there any way to cross the river?

251
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,920
Take the 766th Vanguard Troops, 

252
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,757
and order them to swim across the river.

253
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,175
Yes, I understand sir.

254
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,926
Swim and cross the river.

255
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,762
Tell the tanks to turn around.

256
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,975
Swim and cross the river!

257
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,606
766th Vanguard Troops, prepare to cross! 

258
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,905
Cross! Swim and cross the river!

259
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:44,420
Hey southern comrades, hurry up and show your faces.

260
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,972
Hey, what is this?

261
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,106
Give me one you bastard!

262
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,442
Sir!

264
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,289
Attention HDB troops!

265
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,083
HDB troops!

266
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:30,633
From now on, divide yourselves into two divisions and...

267
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,760
What are you yakking about?

268
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:40,434
Speak up, I can't hear you at all.

269
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,479
From this point on the first division,

270
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:48,234
will bury the corpses.

271
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,110
Is there food?

272
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,198
If there is, can you give us some?

273
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,159
Mr. Bachelor?

274
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,169
You guys... have you ever stabbed someone?

275
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,255
Have you stabbed any communists?

276
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,722
I'm not burying any corpses.

277
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,184
Do we have to do those kinds of things? Huh?!

278
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,271
We're here to kill those communist bastards.

279
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,813
Not to bury corpses!

280
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,190
Isn't that right?!

281
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,193
Right, right!

282
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,985
Yeah, that's right!

283
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,492
You still have to listen to the commander.

284
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,748
It's the orders of Kang Seok Dae!

285
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:46,250
Orders?

286
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:50,087
Why should we listen to them?

287
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,384
If you don't, you'll be shot.

288
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:04,976
By who? You?

289
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:06,979
Shoot me?

290
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,335
What are you looking at, bastard?

291
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,836
Move out of the way!

292
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:42,640
Hurry, take it, take it!

294
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,612
One...Two...Three!

295
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,882
One shot has to shoot like 100.

296
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:22,972
I've trained 8 times before going to war.

297
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,474
You all have only one chance.

298
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,519
So, what did I say?

299
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,063
One shot works like 100.

300
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,856
One more time!

301
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,525
One shot works like 100!

302
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,486
Form up! Line up!

303
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,116
Watch closely.

304
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,203
You saw it?

305
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,998
If you do it wrong, 

306
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,167
you'll lose a finger.

307
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,085
Prone position!

308
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,674
Load your weapon!

309
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,301
Fire!

310
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,127
Wow!

311
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,357
Kap Jo, 

312
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,026
there's so many people here, and they want us to

313
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,778
survive for half a month only with these?

314
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,157
If this bastard wouldn't eat so greedily, we'd have enough for one month.
 
315
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,660
Hey, this week is a luxury 

316
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,370
where I don't have to pay for snacks!

317
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,332
Kap Jo!

318
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,583
What?

319
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,252
Later at night,

320
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,213
That bastard, Mr. Bachelor, should we

321
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,215
beat him up later on? Who are we, after all!

322
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,093
Who are we?

323
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,555
We are orphans. The bastards.

324
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,765
We are the hoodlums, the bastards.

325
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,184
Kap Jo can barely read.

326
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,228
Shut your mouth, asshole.

327
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,567
Even though our captain is "Mr. Bachelor", Kap Jo, you're even better.

328
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,402
Yep.

329
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,376
Wow, it's awesome!

330
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,212
Kap Jo, this is a hand grenade, right?

331
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,505
Give it to me!

332
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:02,923
Is it real?

333
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,258
Of course, you idiot.

334
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,677
This thing can go "boom" 

335
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,388
and blow up an entire market.

336
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,431
It'll explode?

337
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,515
Yeah.

338
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,976
Wow...

339
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:16,896
You can blow up everyone with one of these!

340
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,024
You'll disappear without a trace.

341
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,446
Don't move!

342
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,990
Hey!

343
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,241
Hey hey hey!

344
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,118
I said don't move!

345
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,037
Don't joke about that!

346
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,956
Ahhh...jerk.

347
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,418
What is this?

348
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:42,922
Idiot!

349
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,924
Throw it away you idiot!

350
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,966
Throw it away!

351
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,260
Throw!

352
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,770
Run away!

353
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,995
Stay still you idiot! 

354
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,332
Now there are

355
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,376
no more potatoes.

356
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,169
We have nothing to eat besides the corn outside.

357
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,881
Don't worry, we'll get you food.

358
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,677
Wang-pyo, let's go get our tools.

359
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,428
Stop right there.

360
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,432
Butt out.

361
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,811
What?

362
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,563
That's an order.

363
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,022
An order...

364
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,569
Another order?

365
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,357
If the North attacks, how are we going to fight with these guys?

366
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,903
Our soldiers are counting on us to cover them.

367
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:35,326
That's why we have to fight with strength.

368
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,378
Mom, I want to see you.

369
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,553
Today, I fought with the Armed Forces of Pohang.

370
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,931
Everyone else left to the front of the Nakdong River.

371
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,312
Now, there are only 71 of us.

372
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,234
Mom...

373
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,405
I hear children in the next room laughing

374
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:41,326
It's been a long time since I've heard laughter.
 
375
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,753
To keep those children laughing,

376
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,088
Please watch over them.

377
00:43:55,716 --> 00:44:01,263
Hey! What kind of bumpkin dance is that?!

378
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,223
Poongchun,

379
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,767
let's show them how it's done.

380
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,817
Ahhh, in front of these kids.

381
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,323
Charleston Swing

383
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,389
Kap Jo, Kap Jo, Kap Jo!

384
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,698
It's 10 o'clock. All of you, go to sleep.

386
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,334
Platoon 1, what are you doing?

387
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,252
Is this a picnic?!

388
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,420
We're in the middle of a war.

389
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,256
Hurry and get up!

391
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,530
The M1 is heavy, isn't it?

392
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,699
None of these guns are heavy.

393
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,451
But what kind of gun is this long?

394
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,911
These guns were made in the U.S.

395
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,413
If you shoot it,

396
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,499
it will go far.

397
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,588
Should we shoot it?

398
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,550
Just try it.

399
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,594
And you'll wake up everyone.

400
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,473
But Hyung...

401
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,061
I want to eat my mother's spicy cabbage stew 

402
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,814
and anchovy soup with some spicy radish.

403
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,276
Think of how delicious it would be.

404
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,653
Then why are you with me now, you moron?

405
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,575
Are they U.S soldiers?

406
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:11,662
If they're our allies...

407
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,247
They won't shoot at us. 

408
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,500
So they're the enemy?

409
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,919
Yes, tell the platoon to form a circle.

410
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,586
Okay.

411
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,509
Brother, I need to go pee.

412
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,595
Hold it in, you idiot!

413
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,013
Can't you do it later?

414
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,023
Get down!

415
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,485
Get down, get down!

416
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,321
The wind feels nice.

417
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,410
What do we do...

418
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,790
Yeah I know...

419
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,876
We hardly ever eat....

420
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:06,466
We're not going back after this?

421
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,888
It'd be good after we finish this tour...

422
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,809
Although if I could, I'd go back to my hometown right now.

423
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,637
Ceasefire!

424
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,641
Ceasefire!

425
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:10,530
Should I check it out?

426
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,575
Stop shaking and talk!

427
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,369
Looks like we hit the jackpot.

428
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:18,473
Mother...

429
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,520
Why aren't you shooting him, moron?!

430
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,528
Hey, should I do it?

431
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:59,014
Mom, I killed a North Korean soldier today.

432
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,059
I was told that North Koreans

433
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:06,688
are monsters with horned heads.

434
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,776
But, those words from his mouth...

435
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,864
he was looking for his mother.

436
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:27,375
Mom, why do I have to be at war?

437
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,380
These complicated and painful feelings...

438
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,591
I think your heart would sink 

439
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,677
if you knew about them.

440
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,172
Hey, it's finally cooked.

441
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,006
Is this corn?

442
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:27,185
No matter what, I don't think this is going to work.

443
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,313
Aren't the Communists spread out everywhere?

444
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,815
Why are we defending this school?

445
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:37,070
Post sentries around the school.

446
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,729
Commander, do you think we can use these?

447
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,106
Who knows?

448
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,236
Let's take it.

449
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,703
Hey, look at him.

450
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,970
Hey. stop smoking cigarettes.

451
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,144
Mind your own business.

452
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,021
Why do you act so bossy?

453
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,315
You're not the platoon leader!

454
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,360
Do you want to die?

455
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:11,831
Just like that.

456
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,501
Those were imported smokes, you idiot!

457
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,671
In the woods, one cigarette smells like 10 cigarettes.

458
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:20,090
The nerve of this bastard...

459
00:54:29,974 --> 00:54:32,060
Get down!

460
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:33,978
Where are you?!

461
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:35,730
Who is it?!

462
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,525
Get down you idiot!

463
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,074
Wang Pyu...

464
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:51,287
Wang Pyu!

465
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,497
Wang Pyu!

466
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,003
Shit!

467
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,508
I'll kill you bastards!

468
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:05,009
Kap Jo!

469
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,053
Get back here, it's dangerous!

470
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,001
Get down!

471
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,859
Get down!

472
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,660
Fire!

473
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,943
Pung Cheon, go over there!

475
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:43,996
Throw your gun away!

476
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:45,581
Please!

477
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,001
No!

478
00:59:49,001 --> 00:59:51,963
Kim II-Sung is leading the Republic of Korea!

479
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,673
Put down your guns and surrender!

480
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:55,550
Kap Jo, don't shoot. That's an order.

481
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,470
That's a North Korean soldier.

482
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:03,433
The enemy that does not surrender will die!

483
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,979
For the liberation of the South Korean people!

484
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:09,522
Don't shoot!

485
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:25,913
Shoot.

486
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,417
Shoot, you moron.

487
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,431
Commander,

488
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,017
you heard him!

489
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,396
You heard the communist, you should have shot him!

490
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:45,595
Sir, you're here?

491
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,101
How many casualties?

492
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,562
16 are dead, 5 are injured.

493
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,444
Shit!

494
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,739
Shit! Don't touch me! It hurts!

495
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,283
Hang on!

496
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:09,744
Just hold on!

497
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,078
Why can't you hold on?

498
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:13,247
Shit! Go away!

499
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:14,957
Bear with it!

500
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,105
Wang Pyu, that idiot.

501
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,399
I knew that he was looking for me.

502
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,486
He was a member of my gang, but

503
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:46,697
he always got himself hurt, stabbed 

504
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:47,740
and injured on his own.

505
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:49,742
Crazy bastard.

506
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,371
Do you have a cigarette?

507
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,432
This is a zippo lighter I stole from someone.

508
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,143
Do you want it?

509
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,649
It's fine.

510
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,382
This is Cuckoo's Nest.

511
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,466
Come in, over.

512
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,635
Nest here, we encountered the enemy!

513
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:53,723
Cockoo's Nest here, we have encountered the enemy!

514
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:57,226
Yes sir, I was 

515
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,270
reporting the situation, but...

516
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,230
Could I speak with Captain Kang Suk Dae?

517
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,733
Is this the captain?

518
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,025
How are you?

519
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,986
This is the radio operator, Jae-Seon.

520
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,028
Who?

521
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,698
Yesterday, we encountered the enemy.

522
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,325
We killed 12 communist soldiers.

523
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,203
16 men were killed by communist soldiers.

524
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:18,956
The rest escaped, others were wounded.

525
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,417
Hurry up and come back.

526
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,003
The communists have attacked 2 times.

527
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,464
What?! Put the commander on line!

528
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,012
Oh Jung-Beom speaking.

529
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,264
Those scumbags are tying us up!

530
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,979
We don't know when we'll be back!

531
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,356
Give me a status report every 30 minutes!

532
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,359
I'll call for reinforcements!

533
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:49,153
Don't be afraid and wait!

534
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,697
Hold out for two hours!

535
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,409
It's two hours!

537
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,334
What did he say?

538
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,251
Is he coming over?

539
01:06:34,406 --> 01:06:35,824
He said he's sending us reinforcements.

540
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,702
Until then, I'll figure something out.

541
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,249
From the sound of the bombs, it's no joke.

542
01:06:44,124 --> 01:06:45,042
We're being beaten like children.

543
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,835
We're like kids robbed of our own country.

544
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,754
Well that's too bad.

545
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,421
Get out!

546
01:06:59,056 --> 01:06:59,682
Fire!

547
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:09,817
Reload!

550
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:52,318
The North Korean army now has the 766th Vanguard Troops

551
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,404
and 5 divisions.

552
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,322
They are attacking Pohang.

553
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:57,906
We need more reinforcements.

554
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,576
Where do you want to send the troops?

555
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:01,994
Don't you see?

556
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,871
The Nakdong River is a bloodbath!

557
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,290
Only the lives of those student soldiers are valuable?

558
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,125
Everyone's life is precious.

559
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,210
But we have to stay here defending to the end!

560
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,671
If the Nakdong River falls, then it's all over for us!

561
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,590
You're right, save them all...

562
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:15,966
Save everyone!

563
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:17,259
All the parents and families too, do you want to?

564
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:28,812
Stay with your unit, there's no one we can send.

565
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,279
How many doctors are there?

566
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,411
All of them are gone, even the nurses.

567
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:49,792
How many trucks went out yesterday?

568
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,340
There are 15.

569
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,676
You're lying, it's 20! 

570
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:01,720
You son of a bitch!

571
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,725
I didn't count them, I just gave an example!

572
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,599
Please, continue, Political Commissar Comrade.

573
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:58,026
Are we done yet?

574
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,240
Comrade Cho Yeon.

575
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:05,117
Sir!

576
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,327
Get me a cup of water.

577
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,543
Give it to the student soldier.

578
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,551
Give it to him.

579
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:47,743
In order to gain the enemy's trust, you have to be compassionate.

580
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:51,497
To gain the loyalty of the people and strengthen our political party.

581
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,291
Indeed, you must be merciful.

582
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,048
What do you mean by that?

583
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,134
Follow me.

584
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,054
Stand up!

585
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,731
Political Commissar Comrade,

586
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:22,694
he's gone through enough.

587
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:13,954
Hey, Kap Jo!

588
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:40,522
Hurry up and get ready!

589
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,157
Hold it, hold it!

590
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:34,576
Dal Yong!

591
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:53,053
Hey, who's the commander here?

592
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:18,203
You're the commander, student Oh Jung Beom?

593
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,209
Who are you?

594
01:14:29,589 --> 01:14:34,261
I am...a Korean People's Democracy worker.

595
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:39,850
General Pak is here with 5 divisions and the 766th Vanguard.

596
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,436
Our troops,

597
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,110
in exactly two hours will attack here at 12:00.

598
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,030
This place is going to be occupied.

599
01:14:58,613 --> 01:15:02,706
If you surrender and raise a white flag there...

600
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,458
All of you will be spared.

601
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:13,633
That is compassion, my students.

602
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,219
Our comrades

603
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,430
held by U.S. imperialists will be liberated.

604
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:22,893
And we will unify Korea together.

605
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,227
Also...

606
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,287
Now comrades, be responsible for the unification

607
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:46,374
of our country, because this is within our army's power.

608
01:15:57,135 --> 01:16:01,640
At 12:00, let's meet then.

609
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,737
Comrade...

610
01:16:17,697 --> 01:16:19,783
I hope nothing bad will happen.

611
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:05,620
Jak Jeong Wan.

612
01:17:06,037 --> 01:17:07,205
Did the 4 divisions of the

613
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:08,290
enemy change movements?

614
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,501
Reinforcements have been constantly on the front lines of the Nakdong River,

615
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,295
as Pohang does not detect the movement of enemy.

616
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:15,463
Gang Dae We, did you hear that?

617
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:17,799
Pohang can be reinforced.

618
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,763
Yesterday, they engaged the enemy twice.

619
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,225
Please, let me take some soldiers.

620
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:29,895
I'll defend it, no matter what.

621
01:17:37,944 --> 01:17:38,695
Follow me.

622
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:49,789
Attention!

623
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:54,961
Hey, get your ass over here.

624
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,506
Ask if you have any backup troops.

625
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,800
Sir, is there any backup you've got there?

626
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,848
There's a severe shortage of U.S. troops.

627
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,684
Even at the Nakdong River front, there is a severe shortage.

628
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,397
I'm afraid it's not possible to send any troops any time soon.

629
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,275
There is a shortage with the US troops. He said it's going to be difficult to send support.

630
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:23,990
Follow me.

631
01:18:35,418 --> 01:18:37,003
Open them up, now.

632
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,262
This is the new line of super bazookas.
 
633
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,639
It will make it that much easier

634
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,891
in stopping those North Korean tanks.

635
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:51,601
He said that with the new super bazookas 

636
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,436
it's going to be much easier to stop North Korean tanks.

637
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:56,940
Thank you very much, sir.

638
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,540
Everyone, listen well!

639
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:15,500
On the Nakdong River front line,

640
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:19,379
There, they're fighting and dying gloriously!

641
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,349
Jung Dal Young, this moron, is a coward.

642
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,394
Traitor! 

643
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:35,812
Coward!

644
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:38,898
He sold out the land

645
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,067
on which we all eat.

646
01:19:42,902 --> 01:19:45,739
This traitor

647
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,033
needs to be killed by our own hands!

648
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,660
Do you guys hear me?!

649
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,746
That's right, that's right!

650
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:54,998
I don't feel so good...

651
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,666
Why don't you

652
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:05,342
just kill me, can you do that?

653
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,302
Just wait a bit.

654
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,972
The captain will rescue us and bring us food.

655
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,772
Brother, still...

656
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:38,208
The kimchi stew that I used to eat. I want that too..

657
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:41,920
Hey, Dal Young!

658
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:46,132
This asshole, he's a traitor!

659
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,426
Stop it you jerks!

660
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,011
Damn it!

661
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,137
Stop it!

662
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,130
You're still holding a grudge...huh?

663
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,423
Put that gun down.

664
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,884
If you run away, you can live.

665
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,220
To the People's Army....

666
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:35,682
Even if you go, we can still survive.

667
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,017
Damn you.

668
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,619
If you're going to run away, run away quietly!

669
01:21:59,455 --> 01:22:00,665
I'm going to run away?

670
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:16,139
Kap Jo, Kap Jo!

671
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:18,474
Come here, you asshole!

672
01:22:19,475 --> 01:22:20,935
Yes, you coward!

673
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:23,021
Do you really want to die that much?!

674
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:25,773
Go and die like a dog!

675
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,901
I'm going to live greatly, 

676
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:28,735
then die!

677
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,198
Stop it!

678
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,417
Hey, let's go!

679
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,213
You guys aren't going?

680
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:37,387
I sure as hell won't!

681
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,223
We're going to go at them and fight them 

682
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,767
even with our bare hands!

683
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,619
Let's go!

684
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:13,214
Let's move out.

685
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,432
Comrade Commander!

686
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,600
They have not raised the white flag.

687
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:33,651
Comrade Commander, why are you delaying?

688
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:35,987
Let's attack now.

689
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,906
In order for our soldiers to attack, they need an order.

690
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:41,576
With Pohang unprepared, we should attack now.

691
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:43,619
Why are you delaying it?

692
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,540
We can end the war by August 15th if we attack, can't we?

693
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,752
If you have already killed a soldier, 

694
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,422
in your fellow soldier's eyes, you are also a soldier.

695
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:58,309
Comrade Commander, no matter how young he is, 

696
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,094
whoever holds a gun there is the enemy.

697
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,556
The student commander there,

698
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:07,018
is inexperienced and weak.

699
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,565
Are you listening to me?

700
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,361
I would have killed them already,

701
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,323
if they were real soldiers.

702
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,616
What?

703
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,744
Comrade Park.

704
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:29,415
Without the Central Party's orders, you freed an enemy prisoner 

705
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,250
who should have been shot!

706
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,721
One more word.

707
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,558
And I'll send you back to the Central Party in a casket.

708
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:13,668
Mom,

709
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:18,464
The undergarments you bought for me, I put them on now.

710
01:26:20,174 --> 01:26:22,635
Why didn't I think about it before, I don't know.

711
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,056
Mom,

712
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:31,561
Maybe I might die today.

713
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,440
There are so many enemies around us.

714
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:40,319
It's just that things aren't going well. I'm not saying it's the end, at least not yet.

715
01:27:23,946 --> 01:27:24,906
I found it!

716
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,549
Assemble the troops 1km away from the school.

717
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,009
Wait for my command.

718
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,470
Do not fire until ordered.

719
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,641
Then attack.

720
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,559
If I die fighting,

721
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:01,604
I hope I won't be hungry ever again.

722
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,553
Reinforcements are coming from the river soon.

723
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,765
We are going to hold out for the next hour.

724
01:30:39,433 --> 01:30:40,768
We will all join forces and fight.

725
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:42,186
Fight!

726
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:44,105
Fight!

727
01:30:45,981 --> 01:30:48,192
Fight!

728
01:30:49,443 --> 01:30:51,070
The Captain told us

729
01:30:51,904 --> 01:30:53,739
HDB troops are student soldiers.

730
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:59,078
We are student soldiers!

731
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:00,663
We are student soldiers!

732
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:07,670
We are student soldiers!

733
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:28,899
Hooray, People's National Liberation Army!

734
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,401
Hooray!

735
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,695
Hooray! Hooray!

736
01:31:34,488 --> 01:31:35,698
Do you need some help?

738
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:17,490
Thank you, comrade!

739
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:21,535
You have strong muscles, comrades!

740
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:42,807
Are you ready?

741
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:48,395
Fire.

742
01:32:58,447 --> 01:32:59,281
Why isn't it firing?

743
01:32:59,281 --> 01:32:59,990
I didn't follow instructions.

744
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,741
Fix it right away!

746
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:06,705
This is Cuckoo's nest, over!

747
01:33:07,998 --> 01:33:09,625
Nest here, come in, over!

748
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:12,753
I followed what you said, but it's not working!

749
01:33:14,004 --> 01:33:14,755
Pardon?

750
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:18,551
Chang...The Platoon leader said

751
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:20,219
use your feet.

752
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,762
Kick it.

753
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:42,658
It's falling here!

754
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:50,749
Stop!

755
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:52,877
Everyone stop!

756
01:33:54,044 --> 01:33:55,337
Why, that's...

757
01:34:06,473 --> 01:34:08,976
What the hell are you doing, are you trying to kill us?

758
01:34:09,768 --> 01:34:10,603
Move it.

760
01:34:25,075 --> 01:34:26,785
Cannonball!

761
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:36,962
Comrade Commander...

762
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:40,132
Medic! Medic!

763
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:47,431
Fire!

764
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,769
They repay my kindness with mortars?

765
01:34:53,145 --> 01:34:55,022
Those bastards...

766
01:34:58,734 --> 01:34:59,318
Fire!

767
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:11,747
I'm going to kill you all.

768
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,249
I'm going to kill every single one of you!

769
01:35:16,835 --> 01:35:19,546
All those students were preparing earlier!

771
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:24,093
We should have attacked earlier!

772
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,684
2nd platoon, 2nd platoon!

773
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:33,686
Fall back into the classrooms!

774
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,105
Move it!

775
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:51,537
766th Vanguard of the National Liberation Army!

776
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:53,247
Yes!

777
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:57,710
Dear General Kim Il Sung demands our victory!

778
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:04,258
Charge forward!

779
01:36:57,186 --> 01:36:58,687
Open fire!

780
01:37:17,456 --> 01:37:18,332
2nd platoon!

781
01:37:32,596 --> 01:37:33,639
Shoot!

782
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:34,890
Shoot!

783
01:37:42,397 --> 01:37:44,149
Cuckoo! Respond! 

784
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,277
Cuckoo, over!

785
01:37:47,277 --> 01:37:49,112
Cuckoo?!

786
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:29,278
Get down!

787
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:55,155
Everyone inside!

788
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:56,531
Fall back!

789
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,575
Everyone inside!

790
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:01,286
Fall back!

791
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:34,528
Everyone, get back! Get back!

792
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:05,017
Hey Jung Beom!

793
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:07,853
I'm not finished yet!

794
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,367
Kap Jo! Kap Jo!

795
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:30,584
Carry the machine guns inside!

796
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,766
It's the tanks, let's go!

797
01:41:46,933 --> 01:41:49,019
Tanks! Tanks!

798
01:41:56,485 --> 01:41:57,569
Hurry up!

799
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:10,499
Tanks!

800
01:42:20,133 --> 01:42:25,847
Shit!

801
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:20,318
I want to go back home.

802
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:22,112
What about you?

803
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:25,574
I'm going to die alone.

804
01:43:31,037 --> 01:43:32,414
When we go back to this school

805
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,416
you should go and study well.

806
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:36,835
I'm a student soldier.

807
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:40,964
This sorry kid

808
01:43:42,132 --> 01:43:44,050
couldn't even do well in school.

809
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:48,221
However, now...

810
01:43:50,348 --> 01:43:51,308
Look.

811
01:43:52,475 --> 01:43:53,602
From a kid into a student soldier.

812
01:43:59,774 --> 01:44:00,817
That's great.

813
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:03,987
We're both student soldiers.

814
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:16,166
Let's go!

815
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:17,709
Let's go!

816
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:34,768
Watch out!

817
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:44,986
Go quickly.

818
01:44:45,862 --> 01:44:49,199
You're better at fighting than me.

819
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:52,786
You're braver than me.

820
01:44:55,413 --> 01:44:56,539
Go quickly.

821
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,960
Hurry up and go!

822
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:31,741
The reinforcements are coming soon...

823
01:45:31,741 --> 01:45:32,867
The machine guns on the rooftop!

824
01:45:32,867 --> 01:45:33,910
Meet me up there!

825
01:45:46,965 --> 01:45:48,133
Move quickly, quickly!

826
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:49,968
And get the molotov cocktails!

827
01:45:51,177 --> 01:45:52,012
Hey!

828
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:02,230
Jung Beom!

829
01:46:16,286 --> 01:46:17,120
Watch out!

830
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:12,300
Stop...stop!

831
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:30,151
You're not going home?

832
01:47:30,318 --> 01:47:31,111
We're going to sacrifice our lives for this school.

833
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:32,779
Both of us.

834
01:47:33,988 --> 01:47:37,033
Screw that! I'm not going to school today!

835
01:47:48,294 --> 01:47:50,422
Comrade Commander!

836
01:47:51,214 --> 01:47:53,174
What is that? We're being attacked from the rear!

837
01:47:53,174 --> 01:47:54,551
You got us into this mess!

838
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,887
You are a traitor!

839
01:47:59,055 --> 01:48:00,390
All troops, retreat!

840
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:02,892
Hey, comrade...

841
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:13,778
You talk too much.

842
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:20,285
1st unit, move forward!

843
01:48:39,345 --> 01:48:40,430
To the left!

844
01:48:48,396 --> 01:48:49,647
Jung Beom, reload this!

845
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,630
Hey comrade...

847
01:51:57,919 --> 01:52:00,630
I wish it didn't have to end this way.

848
01:52:01,214 --> 01:52:02,382
You fought amazingly well.

849
01:52:02,715 --> 01:52:05,885
But what can you do?

850
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:09,597
You were born in South Korea.

851
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:13,351
I was born in North Korea.

852
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:21,025
Time to put you out of your misery, Comrade Oh Jung Beom.

853
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:46,050
You bastard...

854
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:10,708
I'm so sorry...

855
01:54:24,857 --> 01:54:25,983
...then turn it on. Then afterwards, tune it.

856
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:30,196
Then after tuning, adjust the sound frequency.

857
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,657
Then match the sounds.

858
01:54:32,657 --> 01:54:33,449
What is this?
 
859
01:54:33,449 --> 01:54:34,325
Frequency.

860
01:54:34,325 --> 01:54:35,785
It's not the frequency, it's the power.

861
01:54:36,285 --> 01:54:37,370
I told you, first you have to turn power off.

862
01:54:38,621 --> 01:54:40,665
Hey, Jae-seon, come over here!

863
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:42,500
Thank you.

864
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:48,673
You're blocking me you idiot!

865
01:54:48,923 --> 01:54:49,799
Sit down!

866
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:51,008
I said sit down.

867
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:24,083
Ready? I'm about to take the picture.

868
01:55:24,542 --> 01:55:28,796
One... Two... Three!

869
01:55:52,542 --> 01:55:59,796
This movie was based on the true story of Battle of Pohang Girl's Middle School, which took place on August 13, 1950, fought by 71 student soldiers in the Republic of Korea's 3rd Corps. 

870
01:56:03,542 --> 01:56:10,796
Those 71 student soldiers delayed the North Korean's advance for 11 hours, giving time for South Korean and UN troops to counterattack later on.

871
