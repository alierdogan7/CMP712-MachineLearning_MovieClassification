00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,459
including three individuals
whose wealth and power

176
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,430
you personally continue to shield.

177
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,001
I really must protest.

178
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,529
Colonel Eichmann,

179
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:39,840
I was an anti-Semite
before you were born.

180
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,446
I bow to no one in my distaste
for the chosen people.

181
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,974
I drafted Hungary's best,
most vigorous anti-Jewish laws.

182
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,644
But death camps like Auschwitz
were never what I had in mind.

183
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:56,622
Auschwitz, Auschwitz. No.

184
00:12:56,793 --> 00:13:00,661
Even our enemies, by their silence,

185
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,027
acknowledge that we are right
about the Jew.

186
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,500
Colonel, it is tradition in our country

187
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,902
to leave all matters of commerce
and finance to the Jew.

188
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:16,978
And I am not going to violate
this ancient Hungarian tradition.

189
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,943
- Certain Jews...
- All Jews must go.

190
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,845
You will not be allowed to interfere
any longer with deportations.

191
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,486
Not be allowed?
I will not be spoken to in this...

192
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,817
The Führer demands
a favorable ruling from your cabinet.

193
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,716
The deportations will be intensified.

194
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,884
The final solution
has been set in motion.

195
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,121
JACOB:
Your behavior was outrageous.

196
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,391
You humiliated your mother.

197
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,626
It's a good thing von Fremd
is a tolerant man.

198
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:43,602
Tolerant? Germany's collapsing,
he needs your money

199
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,105
for all those ambitious new projects
such as Auschwitz.

200
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,902
MAJ:
Raoul.

201
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,874
Is that really a good investment,
Uncle?

202
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,775
MAJ:
Oh, Raoul, please.

203
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,280
You're not only impertinent,
you're naive.

204
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,509
Of course we do business
with the Germans.

205
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,278
Who hasn't?

206
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:02,184
But we are also working closely
with the anti-Hitler movement.

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,586
Banking is not a business
for moralists.

208
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,862
And you certainly demonstrated that
when we sent you to Heifer in '37.

209
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:15,128
Somehow I wasn't made to sit
behind a desk and say no to people.

210
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,204
But instead
of calculating exchange rates,

211
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,738
you brooded into your wine glass

212
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,705
and talked philosophy
with your new friends.

213
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,310
Brooded? We did that some.

214
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:23,945
We also talked about movies
and women.

215
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,775
Oh, please, stop, both of you.

216
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,440
Raoul, with your goading.

217
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,588
And, Jacob, you do make Raoul out
such a dilettante.

218
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,985
It simply isn't true.

219
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:38,184
He worked very well in Heifer.
He always works well,

220
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,296
at the university and as an architect.

221
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:45,222
I thought his plans for the new spa
were quite stunning.

222
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,562
The fact that you and your brother
rejected them

223
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:50,069
tells more about your own limitations
than about Raoul's.

224
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,608
JACOB: The bath he designed for it
was outrageous.

225
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,208
It was brilliant.

226
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:56,072
Not really, Mother.

227
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,941
But my quick cork, that was brilliant.

228
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,614
Popped right out of the bottle
without a corkscrew.

229
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,309
And without a single customer
among wine merchants everywhere.

230
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,944
[LAUGHS]

231
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,646
But was I discouraged? Never.

232
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,190
I went right on
to cheap Japanese zippers,

233
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,259
which led directly
to my current involvement

234
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:15,158
with a middle-European
trading company, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

235
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,996
Where I'm a leading authority
on the importation

236
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,796
of smoked goose breast
and pickled cucumbers.

237
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,132
JACOB:
Kalman Lauer is a generous man,

238
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:27,504
and his philanthropic zeal has led him
to offer you a desk and a phone

239
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,736
and to send you off to any place

240
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:31,903
where your gift of languages
could be useful to him.

241
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:35,175
Not to mention your talent
for locating the wild truffle.

242
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,320
A talent I share with rooting hogs.

243
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,417
Raoul,

244
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:45,493
you said you were drilling
your home guards this afternoon.

245
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,492
- Can you drop me off in town?
- Yes.

246
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,654
JACOB:
Don't turn away from this, Maj.

247
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,960
- I'm not turning away from anything.
- Please don't deny it.

248
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,033
You have confided to me your sorrow
at Raoul's indifference.

249
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,229
RAOUL:
Indifference?

250
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,431
JACOB:
Towards having a worthy career.

251
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,009
- That's a source of sorrow for me too.
RAOUL: Uncle.

252
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:04,946
Just the opposite may be true.

253
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,112
I have felt so keenly

254
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:14,916
the enormous advantages I came into,
the privilege,

255
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:18,652
the love that has surrounded me.

256
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,296
And I'm afraid
I've made so little of it all.

257
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,797
That I find myself going about my
business in the middle of a nightmare,

258
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,972
trading shrewdly for shipments
of wild truffles in countries

259
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,508
where people are herded like cattle
into freight cars and gas chambers.

260
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,078
JACOB:
We can't change the world.

261
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,906
The war is practically over.
The nightmare will end.

262
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:45,944
But if you go on wandering through life
in search of perfect justice,

263
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:47,384
you'll starve, my boy.

264
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,816
Swedes don't starve, Uncle.
They're neutral.

265
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,423
Especially Wallenbergs.

266
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:07,169
MAN 1: The assignment requires
an experienced diplomat.

267
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,903
MAN 2: It also calls for
a persuasive one, doctor,

268
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,207
and it looks like our man
just qualified himself.

269
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,748
MAN 3:
Once Raoul makes a commitment...

270
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,385
Now, just for your information,

271
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,647
our American ambassador
has talked to your foreign ministry

272
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,519
and we're sure
that they'll respond favorably.

273
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:27,891
Oh, Raoul, you're improving.
Only 25 minutes late.

274
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,929
My apologies, Kalman.

275
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,465
Iver Olsen,
my friend Raoul Wallenberg.

276
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,399
- How do you do?
- I believe you already know Dr. Preiss.

277
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,199
- Always a pleasure.
- Indeed, sir.

278
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:43,438
Well, I hear
that we're practically fellow Americans.

279
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:47,046
Well, you spent five years
in Michigan, didn't you?

280
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,207
RAOUL:
Much more. Maine to Mexico.

281
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:51,319
Nice to see you, sir. Champagne?

282
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,279
Beer, please.

283
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,252
My champagne cousins
own the hotel,

284
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:58,120
so the employees
are under the misconception

285
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,592
that I have some share
in the Wallenberg fortune.

286
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:01,787
[MEN LAUGH]

287
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,524
WAITER: Sir.
RAOUL: Thank you.

288
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,963
- Skoal.
LAUER: Skoal.

289
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:13,239
As you know, Mr. Olsen's
with the War Refugee Board

290
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,400
set up by President Roosevelt.

291
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:19,776
Yes, we're looking for someone
to represent us in Budapest.

292
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,915
Mr. Lauer has told me
that the purpose of your organization

293
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:26,543
is to save the 250,000 Jews
left in Hungary.

294
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:30,852
Then you can understand why it is
so important to choose the right man.

295
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,428
LAUER: Dr. Preiss is head of the
Jewish Committee here in Stockholm.

296
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,428
OLSEN: Yes, as foreigners,
we thought it proper

297
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,726
to consult with an advisory group.

298
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,495
I've told Mr. Olsen
about the many trips

299
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,900
you've taken for me to Budapest.

300
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:48,637
Business as well as in search
of my wife's family.

301
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,870
He knows the city.

302
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,173
He has contacts.

303
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:57,385
But Dr. Preiss still has his doubts
about me.

304
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,852
Only about your seriousness,
Mr. Wallenberg.

305
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,356
If I am selected

306
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:10,056
and if the Foreign Office agrees
to give me the latitude I need,

307
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,060
I would be relentless, gentlemen.

308
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,228
You'd be a fully accredited
Swedish diplomat

309
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,374
attached to the legation.

310
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:22,744
What the mystery writers call
"a cover."

311
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,675
Ha. Precisely.

312
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:26,542
Now, my contact tells me

313
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,684
that your country is ready
to increase its representation.

314
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:33,618
And they're fully aware of the purpose
you mentioned, to save Jews?

315
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,086
Cautiously aware, I'd say.

316
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,595
I'm told even Swedish Jews
are cautious.

317
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:44,025
That they occasionally suffer
what my American friends call

318
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,792
the Mayflower complex.

319
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,499
Which is?

320
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,300
The fear of crowding the vault
if too many more Jews come here.

321
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,869
Tell me, doctor,
would it militate against me

322
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:59,503
if you knew I would go to any length
to save lives in Budapest?

323
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:01,741
Including the promise
of Swedish citizenship

324
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,714
to as many Jews as possible?

325
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,757
I would answer saying

326
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:17,831
that you have expressed
your seriousness most eloquently.

327
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,264
Amen to that.

328
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:30,776
GABOR: This is dreadful.
Quite dreadful. It won't do at all.

329
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:36,009
- It doesn't fit. None of it fits.
- Ha-ha-ha.

330
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:39,416
GABOR: The whole of it is just
one long piece of green.

331
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:43,957
You are like a little boy
with a new soldier suit.

332
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,890
- Look at all these buttons.
- Stand still.

333
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,861
Gabor, we must get this aligned.

334
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:54,501
Ga...

335
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,901
God, I adore you.

336
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:02,002
If the jacket isn't right,
it must go back to the tailor.

337
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,509
The fit isn't right.

338
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:06,308
All the decent tailors in Budapest
were Jews.

339
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:09,076
Well, Gabor,
where have they all gone?

340
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,151
Who knows?
They are such a mysterious breed.

341
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,481
I don't know.
I've met so few Jewish people.

342
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,489
It's one of the advantages
of a convent upbringing.

343
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,457

01:36:36,093 --> 01:36:37,117
Go to Mr. Anger.

1532
01:36:38,796 --> 01:36:40,525
Me, Fisher. I have a pass.

1533
01:36:40,631 --> 01:36:42,656
Good, then you're going back
to Budapest.

1534
01:36:43,801 --> 01:36:45,132
- Grab him.
- I'm on the list.

1535
01:36:45,536 --> 01:36:46,798
Don't let me lose you.

1536
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:48,802
The rest of you, get back to work.

1537
01:36:48,973 --> 01:36:50,770
- All of you are strong...
- Come down.

1538
01:36:50,941 --> 01:36:53,136
Get down.

1539
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:54,868
Get down.

1540
01:36:56,614 --> 01:36:58,309
Sergeant.

1541
01:36:59,049 --> 01:37:02,678
You will answer personally
to the International Red Cross

1542
01:37:02,853 --> 01:37:07,017
and the Swedish-German Friendship
Society, if he dares touch me again.

1543
01:37:07,191 --> 01:37:08,988
MAN 4:
Nobody touch him.

1544
01:37:09,894 --> 01:37:12,556
MAN 5:
Sergeant, what do I do now?

1545
01:37:20,771 --> 01:37:23,171
- Leave him alone.
- Thank you, sergeant.

1546
01:37:25,476 --> 01:37:28,741
Now, if I may proceed.

1547
01:37:29,113 --> 01:37:32,014
All those with documents,
come forward.

1548
01:37:32,816 --> 01:37:34,716
Come forward with your documents.

1549
01:37:35,052 --> 01:37:38,078
It does not matter if you've lost them
or misplaced them, we have a record.

1550
01:37:38,989 --> 01:37:40,513
Yes, sir, they took your pass, eh?

1551
01:37:40,624 --> 01:37:43,457
- Yes, yes.
- Per.

1552
01:37:45,095 --> 01:37:46,926
Yes, you're in the book,
Gasner Abram.

1553
01:37:47,097 --> 01:37:48,689
- Go ahead.
- Come, tell me your name.

1554
01:37:48,866 --> 01:37:50,857
You, I know you, sir.
May I see your pass, please?

1555
01:37:51,035 --> 01:37:53,595
- I lost it.
- Go ahead.

1556
01:37:53,771 --> 01:37:56,831
Let me see your documents, please.
Yes, there it is. There's your pass.

1557
01:37:57,007 --> 01:37:58,702
My tax receipt?

1558
01:37:58,876 --> 01:38:00,343
You think those animals can read?

1559
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:03,412
Go on, he has a pass. Good.

1560
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:07,676
The oldest will go in the car,
the others will follow on behind.

1561
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:12,082
Sergeant, I shall commend you
to your superiors.

1562
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:14,553
Thank you, gentlemen.

1563
01:38:14,725 --> 01:38:18,889
- Who is he?
- You didn't ask for his papers.

1564
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:21,463
He has a Swedish flag on his car,
hasn't he?

1565
01:38:22,499 --> 01:38:24,694
As soon as Mr. Langfelder
has turned the car around,

1566
01:38:24,868 --> 01:38:28,133
we'll follow him back to Budapest.
It will be a long walk.

1567
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,974
But after that,
we'll find a place for all of you

1568
01:38:32,142 --> 01:38:33,632
in one of our safe houses.

1569
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:38,441
And perhaps a cup of hot soup.
Come along.

1570
01:38:38,615 --> 01:38:43,348
- Thank you all, for your cooperation.
WOMAN: I don't believe it.

1571
01:38:46,357 --> 01:38:48,382
Sergeant.

1572
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:50,888
What do you want?

1573
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:54,622
Would you leave us alone
with a few of those Jews?

1574
01:38:54,798 --> 01:38:56,925
Just for a minute.

1575
01:38:57,801 --> 01:38:59,393
Yeah.

1576
01:39:00,104 --> 01:39:02,402
I need a schnapps.

1577

SOLDIER:
You. You with the beard.

1578
01:39:11,415 --> 01:39:14,543
- We haven't finished work.
- Behind the bunkers.

1579
01:39:14,718 --> 01:39:15,776
- Move.
- Move.

1580
01:39:15,953 --> 01:39:18,649
You, over there.

1581
01:39:25,195 --> 01:39:28,653
Per, drop back and make sure
they stay close together.

1582
01:39:28,832 --> 01:39:30,527
Yeah.

1583
01:39:33,971 --> 01:39:36,201
WOMAN:
No! Please! No!

[GUNFIRE]

1585
01:39:39,643 --> 01:39:43,477
Keep walking. Keep walking.

1586
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:50,042
<i>Dearest Mother, today you will get</i>
<i>only these hurried lines.</i>

1587
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,314
<i>Rest assured</i>
<i>that all is well with me.</i>

1588
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:56,459
"Times are extraordinarily exciting.

1589
01:39:56,627 --> 01:39:59,858
The main thing is that we are working
and fighting successfully

1590
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:05,195
to preserve the gift of life,
as you like to call it.

1591
01:40:07,337 --> 01:40:12,036
I'm gaining a truer sense of that gift
in helping to save others here.

1592
01:40:12,242 --> 01:40:16,406
And so you must think of me
as one of the most fortunate of men.

1593
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:19,208
It is not given to many
to live such a life.

1594
01:40:21,418 --> 01:40:25,081
I hope that you are well,
and I promise with all my heart

1595
01:40:25,255 --> 01:40:29,248
that next time you will get
a much fuller report.

1596
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:36,026
I shall close now.
I greet and I kiss you all, Raoul."

1597
01:40:38,535 --> 01:40:42,471
I must say, he seems
to have found himself this time.

1598
01:40:43,774 --> 01:40:45,071
Yeah, I agree.

1599
01:40:48,045 --> 01:40:49,774
Then why the long face?

1600
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:54,376
According to Kalman Lauer,
conditions are worse than ever there.

1601
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,289
Raoul has become
something of a hero.

1602
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,658
And what is conceivably wrong
with that?

1603
01:41:03,627 --> 01:41:05,322
Heroes have been known to die,
Jacob.

1604
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:08,164
That's what's wrong.

1605
01:41:08,799 --> 01:41:11,199
RAOUL: Every hour matters,
lives are in the balance,

1606
01:41:11,368 --> 01:41:15,304
or I would never have allowed a third
party to intrude upon this meeting.

1607
01:41:15,472 --> 01:41:18,999
With or without Monsignor Rotha,

1608
01:41:19,176 --> 01:41:21,110
you are welcome in my house,
Mr. Wallenberg.

1609
01:41:21,278 --> 01:41:24,441
- Call me Raoul.
- Then it's Lisl.

1610
01:41:25,649 --> 01:41:29,779
Tell me if I'm wrong,
but that day in the flower market,

1611
01:41:29,953 --> 01:41:35,255
I sensed you eagerly reaching out
to know, to help.

1612
01:41:35,425 --> 01:41:38,758
And now the situation is so critical,
baroness...

1613
01:41:38,929 --> 01:41:40,556
Lisl.

1614
01:41:40,664 --> 01:41:43,030
- That I couldn't resist coming to you.

1615
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,828
You can't possibly imagine
Gabor is at all like Eichmann.

1616
01:41:46,003 --> 01:41:49,734
I don't know your husband,
but I do know the party he represents.

1617
01:41:49,907 --> 01:41:52,137
LISL:
He's his own person.

1618
01:41:52,309 --> 01:41:54,209
He could never destroy
innocent lives.

1619
01:41:54,378 --> 01:41:58,075
Then let's put it to the test
while we help shape his policies.

1620
01:41:58,248 --> 01:42:01,513
That is where you expect
to make use of me?

1621
01:42:01,685 --> 01:42:05,314
By allowing your passions,
your attitudes to shape mine.

1622
01:42:05,489 --> 01:42:08,856
They are already your attitudes, Lisl.

1623
01:42:11,662 --> 01:42:14,529
I will not be disloyal to him.

1624
01:42:14,698 --> 01:42:17,030
I'm asking you to keep him alive.

1625
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:19,226
Because unless he can turn
his new power

1626
01:42:19,403 --> 01:42:22,463
to save lives and not crush them,

1627
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,632
he will be tried when the war ends,
and executed.

1628
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:30,143
- Oh, my God.
- The point is that need not happen.

1629
01:42:30,314 --> 01:42:32,305
There is still time for him
to disassociate himself

1630
01:42:32,482 --> 01:42:35,110
from this government of madmen.

1631
01:42:35,285 --> 01:42:37,048
I am bearing his child.

1632
01:42:45,329 --> 01:42:48,389
Then you must. Help him.

1633
01:42:48,932 --> 01:42:50,763
My child will be fatherless.

1634
01:42:50,934 --> 01:42:54,028
Not if you act.
He has great influence.

1635
01:42:54,204 --> 01:42:58,402
The only aristocrat in a den of failed
shopkeepers and cashiered officers.

1636
01:42:58,809 --> 01:43:01,539
Szálasi is a convicted murderer.

1637
01:43:01,712 --> 01:43:05,079
Your husband must prevail upon him
to honor the passes.

1638
01:43:05,249 --> 01:43:09,709
To ease restrictions on the Jews.
To refuse to cooperate with the Nazis.

1639
01:43:10,187 --> 01:43:14,214
And to stop the Arrow Cross
from murdering.

Then march them off
to the safe house.

Come on.

01:43:35,646 --> 01:43:38,547
- What if they don't believe me?
- So they'll shoot you.

1646
01:43:39,082 --> 01:43:40,845

You, take that over there.

1648

Yes, you, go on.

01:43:48,592 --> 01:43:50,651

Work then.

all these workers to Buda.

- Wait a moment.
- Orders.

- Let me see your papers.
- I have papers.

- Go on.
- Ferenczy, from headquarters.

01:44:13,216 --> 01:44:15,446
All right. On your way.

You. You. Over there, you.

1659
01:44:26,963 --> 01:44:29,227
You gotta shoot them in the pants
to get work out of them.

- Come on.
- Ha, ha.

01:44:32,836 --> 01:44:37,500
- All right, keep working.
- You, Fodor, with them?

I'm not with them.

until we get to the house.

I save anyone I can,
including myself.

in the Danube,

kill the little Jewish children.

01:45:09,005 --> 01:45:12,202
- I saw.
- So how can you still believe in God?

- How can you still believe in man?
- You didn't answer my question.

It is beneath me
to discuss the Talmud with a tramp.

01:45:21,184 --> 01:45:24,017
Perhaps you would prefer to discuss
the Talmud with the fascists.

Where was your Talmud
when they shot the little children?

01:45:27,524 --> 01:45:32,757
Fodor, what you believe
and what I believe are different things.

1679
01:45:33,363 --> 01:45:38,494
This is what I believe in,
and it is all that they believe in.

1680

1865
01:57:34,484 --> 01:57:36,577

01:57:37,587 --> 01:57:39,612
Please.

1867
01:57:40,389 --> 01:57:43,847
Let's open your Scotch. I'm thirsty.

1868
01:57:55,605 --> 01:57:59,234
Shall we drink to...?
To honor. To duty.

1869
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:02,801
Can you still feel secure, colonel,

1870
01:58:02,979 --> 01:58:07,473
in continuing to carry out your orders
to murder helpless civilians?

1871
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:12,947
They give me orders.
"Get them to the camps."

1872
01:58:13,122 --> 01:58:15,784
Well, by God, I'll do it.
And I'll keep on doing it until...

1873
01:58:15,958 --> 01:58:19,257
Until Valhalla crashes down
around your head.

1874
01:58:19,428 --> 01:58:22,022
Not the twilight of the gods
but the death of monsters.

1875
01:58:22,431 --> 01:58:25,332
Shall we drink
to the death of monsters, Eichmann?

1876
01:58:25,501 --> 01:58:28,732
Get out of here, Wallenberg.
Your charm wears thin.

1877
01:58:28,905 --> 01:58:32,272
I cannot consider this conversation
as private. The Vatican and...

made payable to me personally,

01:59:02,805 --> 01:59:05,330

anywhere you want.

1885
01:59:06,142 --> 01:59:09,236
- And the others?
- They remain.

1886
01:59:10,279 --> 01:59:13,146

Well, the doctor's
coming right away.

1892
02:00:10,406 --> 02:00:13,671
You won't be riding that bicycle
of yours for a few days.

1893
02:00:13,843 --> 02:00:16,073
- I don't know. Why not?
- Are you sure you're all right?

1894
02:00:16,245 --> 02:00:17,439
Colonel Eichmann, please.

1895
02:00:17,613 --> 02:00:20,548
No, I'll, uh... I'll need it

- I'll tell you what I want.

02:00:53,316 --> 02:00:55,580
I want you
to start marching the Jews.

1905
02:00:55,751 --> 02:00:58,879
And you can march them
until they drop.

1906
02:00:59,055 --> 02:01:01,046
This time, I will tolerate no delay.

Did you get your head busted

Did you have to come to this country
illegally like me?

02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:41,428
I'm impressed.
That's why I sought you out.

1983
02:05:41,537 --> 02:05:43,266
Why should I do anything for you?

1984
02:05:43,672 --> 02:05:46,800
- Walde's doing fine by itself.
- Indeed it is.

1985
02:05:46,976 --> 02:05:50,275
But we are overlapping
in certain areas,

1986
02:05:50,446 --> 02:05:53,938

in particular.

we've saved with them?

1989

Hundreds. Nevertheless,
you and I are beginning to overlap.

1990
02:06:01,557 --> 02:06:03,548

for people carrying our passes

1991
02:06:03,726 --> 02:06:05,819
- and we're saving thousands.
- That's your claim.

That's the truth.

02:08:54,897 --> 02:08:57,195
There's no need, madam.

2030
02:08:57,533 --> 02:09:00,434
- Good night and good luck.
- Good night.

2031

2032
02:09:19,621 --> 02:09:22,021
- Yeah?
- Tell me something.

2033
02:09:23,158 --> 02:09:27,026
Do you ever miss those carefree
Scandinavian days?

2034
02:09:33,335 --> 02:09:35,269
Yes.

2035
02:09:36,772 --> 02:09:38,672
I don't.

2036
02:09:39,374 --> 02:09:41,535
Isn't it curious?

2037
02:09:42,377 --> 02:09:44,004
They're all a blur to me.

2038
02:09:44,379 --> 02:09:46,904
Full of contentment,

2039
02:09:48,951 --> 02:09:51,078
but it's as if they never touched me.

2040
02:09:52,588 --> 02:09:54,579
Perhaps nothing ever did before,
Raoul.

2041
02:09:56,425 --> 02:09:58,017
You found yourself here.

2042
02:10:02,231 --> 02:10:06,725
I'm sorry,
but I must not allow your obsession

2043
02:10:06,902 --> 02:10:09,132
to ruin what's left of my marriage.

2044
02:10:09,738 --> 02:10:12,866
It's 1:00 in the morning,
you needn't apologize for leaving.

2045
02:10:13,041 --> 02:10:15,032
Well, you have that sort of effect
on people.

2046
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:16,575
My secret weapon.

2047
02:10:18,947 --> 02:10:22,644
We hit rock bottom today, Per.

2048
02:10:24,186 --> 02:10:26,552
- Yes.
- Marches again.

Get some sleep.

2052
02:11:23,712 --> 02:11:26,681
Welcome to my sitting room.

2053
02:11:27,416 --> 02:11:29,407
Thank you.

2054
02:11:30,786 --> 02:11:34,950
I'm sure Mr. Anger imagines
all kinds of things,

2055
02:11:35,123 --> 02:11:36,715
seeing me here at this hour.

2056
02:11:37,225 --> 02:11:40,422
I promise to disabuse him
in the morning.

2057
02:11:42,097 --> 02:11:44,429
I came to tell you
that your life is in danger.

2058
02:11:44,599 --> 02:11:46,533
I know that.

2059
02:11:49,104 --> 02:11:51,732
Not only from Eichmann,

2060
02:11:51,907 --> 02:11:53,966
Szálasi also.

2061
02:11:54,443 --> 02:11:56,877
And I wanted you to know

2062
02:11:57,045 --> 02:12:01,880
that Gabor tried to stop the marches
from starting again.

2063
02:12:02,551 --> 02:12:06,578
Then you came here
to feed your husband's case?

2064
02:12:07,589 --> 02:12:09,750
You are a neutral witness.

2065
02:12:09,925 --> 02:12:13,326
You might be asked to testify.

2066
02:12:13,495 --> 02:12:15,861
But you could've told me that
on the phone.

2067
02:12:16,031 --> 02:12:21,025
Yes, but the climate is worsening,
as you predicted,

2068
02:12:22,237 --> 02:12:25,434
and I wanted to be sure
that I saw you again

2069
02:12:25,841 --> 02:12:28,810
to tell you these things directly.

2070
02:12:28,977 --> 02:12:30,410
What things, Lisl?

2071
02:12:30,579 --> 02:12:34,845
- That Gabor is not an evil man.
- Simply misguided.

2072
02:12:36,918 --> 02:12:39,216
I am still carrying our child.

2073
02:12:40,122 --> 02:12:41,248
I don't need reminding.

2074
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:44,420
- I was not admonishing you.
- Then what?

2075
02:12:45,427 --> 02:12:47,793
What other things, Lisl?

2076
02:12:50,098 --> 02:12:52,225
I am here...

2077
02:12:54,336 --> 02:12:58,067
...because it was impossible for me
not to be here.

2078
02:13:05,414 --> 02:13:07,177
You...

2079
02:13:08,683 --> 02:13:12,312
...are the most beautiful woman
I have ever known.

2080
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:18,521
And if I take one step towards you,

2081
02:13:18,794 --> 02:13:22,560
I will forget why I came here
in the first place.

2082
02:13:46,588 --> 02:13:48,647
I must leave.

2083
02:13:49,024 --> 02:13:50,651
Leave?

2084
02:13:51,827 --> 02:13:53,795
Is this not the safest place?

2085
02:13:56,498 --> 02:13:58,762
But the warmest.

2086
02:14:19,387 --> 02:14:22,720
Monsignor Rotha told me something
this afternoon

2087
02:14:22,891 --> 02:14:26,349
that moved me very deeply.

2088
02:14:27,095 --> 02:14:30,087
He said the Nazis' greatest victory

2089
02:14:30,265 --> 02:14:33,200
was convincing the Jews
that they were doomed,

2090
02:14:34,436 --> 02:14:39,499
but that you changed that
for thousands of them.

2091

about the real world?

We can try to stop this
only at the trains.

2200
02:25:10,104 --> 02:25:12,766
WOMAN: Please, help me.
- Drive on to the station.

2201
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:15,204
Mr. Wallenberg, please help me.

2202
02:25:19,914 --> 02:25:22,576
CROWD:
Help us. Save us.

2203
02:25:23,518 --> 02:25:25,110
Per,

2204
02:25:26,187 --> 02:25:31,250
what does our Christian faith
tell us about these Nazi scoundrels?

2205
02:25:33,027 --> 02:25:37,396
Who are they? What shaped them?

2206
02:25:39,167 --> 02:25:41,567
I am no theologian.

2207
02:25:41,669 --> 02:25:45,127
CROWD: Please, Mr. Wallenberg.
Save us. Help us.

2208
02:25:45,306 --> 02:25:50,471
Perhaps we are witnessing
the death of God himself.

2209
02:25:51,078 --> 02:25:52,102
CROWD:
Please.

2210
02:26:18,272 --> 02:26:20,502
Move! Move!

2211
02:26:27,882 --> 02:26:30,476
Keep moving. Keep moving.

2212
02:26:42,029 --> 02:26:44,520
Train is ready for you.

2213
02:26:45,099 --> 02:26:47,033
Let's go.

2214
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:54,665
Keep that line tight.

2215
02:27:00,848 --> 02:27:02,338
Move.

2216
02:27:10,424 --> 02:27:12,585
MAN:
Watch out where you're going.

2217
02:27:33,247 --> 02:27:35,977
Go on, we're going up ahead now.

2218
02:27:40,087 --> 02:27:41,748
Move it.

2219
02:27:41,989 --> 02:27:44,253
Don't fall behind.

2220
02:27:48,429 --> 02:27:51,364
- Come on, Jews.
- Come on.

2221
02:27:57,538 --> 02:27:59,529
Get away from that car.

2222
02:28:00,608 --> 02:28:02,667
Keep away from there.

2223
02:28:08,149 --> 02:28:10,413
Off the road. Off the road.

2224
02:28:15,089 --> 02:28:17,614
Let the car through.

2225
02:28:19,327 --> 02:28:21,192
Get away from the car.

2226
02:28:31,138 --> 02:28:33,629
The main thing is statistics.

2227
02:28:33,808 --> 02:28:37,505
Too many died after they got here
before we could load them.

2228
02:28:37,678 --> 02:28:40,670
DIETER: You, you have to take back
the pregnant women and the sick.

2229
02:28:40,781 --> 02:28:43,875
- My orders are otherwise, major.
MAN: Up, up, up. On your feet.

2230
02:28:44,051 --> 02:28:47,509
I want live bodies on the train.

2231
02:28:48,522 --> 02:28:50,717
- You, on the train.
SOLDIER: We're arguing whether Jews

2232
02:28:50,891 --> 02:28:53,883
should die on the train or on the road
to Budapest, what's the difference?

2233
02:28:54,061 --> 02:28:55,790
The useless ones don't go.

2234
02:28:55,963 --> 02:28:57,726
- Look at him.
- You heard what I said!

2235
02:28:57,898 --> 02:29:00,696
DIETER: Shoot them or hang them,
for all I care. The sick ones don't go.

2236
02:29:00,868 --> 02:29:02,927
I'll kill you all with my bare hands!

2237
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:05,129
Come on, you too.

2238
02:29:05,306 --> 02:29:06,637
You with the beard.

2239
02:29:06,807 --> 02:29:11,141
Perhaps we call Budapest, I'll get
a clarification from Minister Biner.

2240
02:29:11,312 --> 02:29:13,212
DIETER:
You do that.

2241
02:29:14,115 --> 02:29:18,279
How did we end up on the same side
with all the garbage of Europe?

2242
02:29:20,087 --> 02:29:21,952
Statistics.

2243
02:29:23,024 --> 02:29:24,423
Where is Teicholz?

2244
02:29:27,461 --> 02:29:30,055
- No, please. Please.
- Get on the train!

2245
02:29:32,767 --> 02:29:34,667
Out of the way.

2246
02:29:37,505 --> 02:29:40,531
Come on, move. Move. Come on.

2247
02:29:42,410 --> 02:29:44,810
Move forward.
Come on, on your feet.

2248
02:29:44,979 --> 02:29:47,846
Never mind all that.
Come on, move forward.

2249
02:29:48,015 --> 02:29:49,949
What are you doing?

2250
02:29:55,489 --> 02:29:59,550
Nobody touch the medicine.
It's not for you.

2251
02:30:01,162 --> 02:30:03,255
- Get away from here.
- Get back.

2252
02:30:06,167 --> 02:30:09,102
- Step back!
- Get out of here. Get away.

2253
02:30:09,537 --> 02:30:11,630
Step back or I'll shoot you.

2254
02:30:12,473 --> 02:30:15,203
RAOUL: Ferenczy.
PER: What are you going to do?

2255
02:30:15,376 --> 02:30:18,709
I'm not sure. Vilmos.

2256
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:22,206
Get me some whiskey, cigarettes
and big packets of money.

2257
02:30:22,383 --> 02:30:24,283
You want me with you?

2258
02:30:24,452 --> 02:30:28,047
No. You and Charles do everything
you can to stop the trains from leaving.

2259
02:30:28,222 --> 02:30:30,213
And write down the names
of people without passes.

2260
02:30:30,391 --> 02:30:34,122
Fill in the blanks
for the young and strong ones.

2261
02:30:44,605 --> 02:30:46,368
Wait for me, huh?

2262
02:30:47,041 --> 02:30:49,635
- Colonel Ferenczy.
- Oh, the Swedes.

2263
02:30:49,810 --> 02:30:51,744
What a nice reunion, colonel.

2264
02:30:51,912 --> 02:30:55,370
Christmas is upon us.
I thought we might celebrate early.

2265
02:30:55,549 --> 02:30:57,176
Celebrate?

2266
02:30:57,351 --> 02:31:01,811
To warm the hearts
of your splendid policemen, huh?

2267
02:31:01,989 --> 02:31:04,253
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Ha, ha.

2268
02:31:06,327 --> 02:31:10,127
So this fellow, this foreign office chap,
he asks,

2269
02:31:10,297 --> 02:31:14,256
"How can Hungarian Jews
becomes Swedes overnight?"

2270
02:31:14,869 --> 02:31:19,465
And I said, "Didn't you know,
the Swedes are the lost tribe of Israel?

2271
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:21,198
These Jews are going home."

2272
02:31:22,409 --> 02:31:25,276
Going home? That's a good one.

2273
02:31:25,446 --> 02:31:28,973
- Stockholm, the new Jerusalem, huh?
- Yes. Yes.

2274
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:33,484
I said, "It's been proven, by measuring
skulls and matching fingerprints,

2275
02:31:33,654 --> 02:31:36,248
the Swedes are descended
from King David.

2276
02:31:36,423 --> 02:31:37,447
[ALL CHUCKLING]

2277
02:31:37,625 --> 02:31:40,856
The Royal House of Sweden
has Jewish roots.

2278
02:31:41,595 --> 02:31:45,588
Our constitution is based
on the Ten Commandments."

2279
02:31:48,369 --> 02:31:53,204
And now for the real Christmas,
huh?

2280
02:31:55,943 --> 02:31:58,309
Dollars? American dollars?

2281
02:31:58,712 --> 02:32:00,111
What do you want from us?

2282
02:32:00,781 --> 02:32:02,408
You know what I want, colonel.

2283
02:32:04,451 --> 02:32:08,114
You all know what I want.

2284
02:32:14,962 --> 02:32:16,657
MAN:
Come on, move it.

2285
02:32:16,830 --> 02:32:20,095
Please, please.
Let me help with the boy.

2286
02:32:20,634 --> 02:32:22,295
- You come with me.
- Leave this to me.

2287
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:24,528
- I've got my orders.
- Leave the child alone.

2288
02:32:24,705 --> 02:32:27,265
Stop! There are people here
who are Swiss citizens.

2289
02:32:27,441 --> 02:32:28,465
Get them out of here!

2290
02:32:28,642 --> 02:32:30,610
There are many people here,
Swedish persons.

2291
02:32:30,778 --> 02:32:31,802
Close the doors.

2292
02:32:31,979 --> 02:32:35,710
Stop! Stop! Keep those doors open!

2293
02:32:35,883 --> 02:32:37,475
Stop!

2294
02:32:37,785 --> 02:32:40,618
Are there any
Swedish protected people here?

2295
02:32:40,721 --> 02:32:41,847
Take these.

2296
02:32:42,022 --> 02:32:45,389
If so, come forward at once.

2297
02:32:46,126 --> 02:32:48,094
You are in violation
of international law!

2298
02:32:48,262 --> 02:32:50,753
Let them get away with that?
Get those men out of here.

2299
02:32:50,931 --> 02:32:52,899
Take these. Pass them out.

2300
02:32:53,067 --> 02:32:54,659
- Those are ours.
- Stop!

2301
02:32:54,835 --> 02:32:56,427
- We have to move the train.
- Stay back.

2302
02:32:56,604 --> 02:32:59,266
I am the secretary
of the Swedish Legation.

2303
02:33:00,274 --> 02:33:04,472
If you have a pass or if you have
lost one, step forward at once.

2304
02:33:04,645 --> 02:33:07,478
Get off the trains at once.

2305
02:33:08,549 --> 02:33:10,107
Josef?

2306
02:33:10,284 --> 02:33:12,149
Mrs. Khan.

2307
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:14,287
Mrs. Khan of the legation.

2308
02:33:14,455 --> 02:33:16,252
- Vilmos.
- I'll take her.

2309
02:33:16,423 --> 02:33:18,755
- Take her to the car.
- Let me have him. Come on, my boy.

2310
02:33:18,926 --> 02:33:21,952
Please. He is very ill.

2311
02:33:22,129 --> 02:33:25,098
- Get him down.
- Anyone with a pass, step forward.

2312
02:33:27,768 --> 02:33:29,998
Take your filthy hands off him.

2313
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:32,502
Mr. Wallenberg is a diplomat.

2314
02:33:32,673 --> 02:33:34,470
Ferenczy, our agreement!

2315
02:33:34,642 --> 02:33:36,405
Stop. Leave him alone!

2316
02:33:36,577 --> 02:33:40,638
I have made an arrangement
with this man, sergeant.

2317
02:33:41,348 --> 02:33:43,782
- We have passes.
- Raise your hands.

2318
02:33:43,951 --> 02:33:46,181
- Raise your hands.
- What's a handful of yids to us?

2319
02:33:46,353 --> 02:33:48,218
RAOUL: Raise your hand
if you have a Swiss pass.

2320
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:51,790
It does not matter if you have lost it.
You are here in the ledger.

2321
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:54,484
You have the full protection
of the King of Sweden

2322
02:33:54,662 --> 02:33:55,959
and the Swiss Republic.

2323
02:33:56,897 --> 02:33:59,331
Oh, Mr. Schuarz,
I know you have a pass.

2324
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,163
Mr. And Mrs. Yultz.
Yes, yes. I gave you passes myself.

2325
02:34:03,337 --> 02:34:06,033
I remember. Hurry.
What is your name?

2326
02:34:06,206 --> 02:34:08,299
Caroline Takie.

2327
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:11,501
Yes, yes, yes.
Her name is in the book.

2328
02:34:11,679 --> 02:34:15,115
This Swede bribes you again,
eh, Ferenczy?

2329
02:34:15,783 --> 02:34:18,217
You'll get your share.

2330
02:34:18,385 --> 02:34:20,751
We'll give him 400 yids.

2331
02:34:20,921 --> 02:34:22,889
- He can't take all of them.
- Hurry.

2332
02:34:23,057 --> 02:34:25,548
- Rabbi. My friend Rabbi?
- Mandel.

2333
02:34:25,726 --> 02:34:28,718
- Rabbi Mandel. Yes, I know.
- Please, follow me. Please.

2334
02:34:28,896 --> 02:34:31,262
Yes, I know you have a pass.
You have sisters in Sweden.

2335
02:34:31,432 --> 02:34:33,332
Come on, Rabbi.

2336
02:34:34,168 --> 02:34:36,830
MAN:
We have our orders.

2337
02:34:37,004 --> 02:34:40,872
My family will be here.
My son, my daughter.

2338
02:34:40,974 --> 02:34:45,911
RAOUL: Yes, your children. Get up,
please. You are protected. Get up.

2339
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:48,514
These are the Rabbi's children.

2340
02:34:49,616 --> 02:34:51,083
Release this man, at once.

2341
02:34:51,685 --> 02:34:53,744
Is there anyone else?

2342
02:34:54,855 --> 02:34:56,550
- Anyone else, raise your hands?
- Me.

2343
02:34:56,724 --> 02:34:59,022
- Speak up.
- We are... We are here.

2344
02:34:59,193 --> 02:35:00,558
Bring the children.

2345
02:35:00,728 --> 02:35:05,722
I'm sorry. I can take only so many,
so I must take the young.

2346
02:35:06,834 --> 02:35:10,429
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you?

2347
02:35:11,071 --> 02:35:13,539
I pity you.

2348
02:35:14,274 --> 02:35:17,368
- Get back in line.
- Yes, dear lady, pity me.

2349
02:35:17,544 --> 02:35:22,038
Close the car doors.
The train is about to leave.

2350
02:35:22,516 --> 02:35:24,916
- Ferenczy!
FERENCZY: Yes?

2351
02:35:25,085 --> 02:35:26,450
Ferenczy, open those doors.

2352
02:35:27,388 --> 02:35:28,946
- Open them.
- I can't do that.

2353
02:35:29,123 --> 02:35:32,581
We have food and medical supplies
on the truck. You will distribute them.

2354
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:36,594
Per. Vilmos.

2355
02:35:37,965 --> 02:35:41,628
See that all our 400
are safely on the trucks.

2356
02:35:42,169 --> 02:35:44,501
WOMAN:
There is another car.

2357
02:35:44,671 --> 02:35:48,266
RAOUL:
Sonja, we'll find a doctor.

2358
02:35:48,809 --> 02:35:50,674
MAN 1:
How many will you take?

2359
02:35:50,844 --> 02:35:52,709
MAN 2: Get back on the train.
MAN 3: Come on.

2360
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:55,542
MAN 2:
Get the people on. Close the doors.

2361
02:35:55,716 --> 02:35:58,378
Get out, Swede!

2362
02:35:58,552 --> 02:36:01,146
Go home, Swede!

2363
02:36:01,755 --> 02:36:04,053
Move the train.

2364
02:36:04,291 --> 02:36:06,316
- Close the doors.
MAN 4: Close the doors.

2365
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:19,237
- Home before dark, as I promised.

03:06:13,565 --> 03:06:18,195
<i>However, nothing sustains us more</i>

2704
03:06:18,370 --> 03:06:22,101
<i>than your thought</i>
<i>that it is given to few men</i>

2705
03:06:22,274 --> 03:06:25,835
<i>to lead a life such as yours.</i>

2706
03:06:26,778 --> 03:06:30,544
<i>There is a room waiting for you</i>
<i>when you return.</i>

2707
03:06:32,718 --> 03:06:39,385
NARRATOR: <i>On January 17th, 1945,</i>
<i>Raoul Wallenberg vanished.</i>

2708
03:06:39,558 --> 03:06:43,551
<i>After repeated requests</i>
<i>for information as to his fate,</i>

2709
03:06:43,662 --> 03:06:45,630
<i>all of which were rebuffed,</i>

2710
03:06:45,797 --> 03:06:51,429
<i>the Soviet Union announced</i>
<i>that he had died in July, 1947.</i>

2711
03:06:51,603 --> 03:06:55,300
<i>No evidence was produced</i>
<i>to support their claims.</i>

2712
03:06:55,474 --> 03:06:58,637
<i>And over the years,</i>
<i>reports about him persist</i>

2713
03:06:58,810 --> 03:07:04,339
<i>from those who claimed to have spent</i>
<i>time with him in Soviet captivity.</i>

2714
03:07:04,516 --> 03:07:08,919
<i>I, Per Anger, was Raoul's colleague</i>
<i>for seven months in Budapest.</i>

2715
03:07:09,087 --> 03:07:13,683
<i>I believe to this day,</i>
<i>he still may be alive.</i>
