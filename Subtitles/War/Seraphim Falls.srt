All right, Danny, your turn.

544
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:04,909
Hit it round the edges,
nice and hard.

545
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,579
Watch your fingers.
Get your balance.

546
01:19:07,647 --> 01:19:09,548
Get your balance.
Put that leg over.

547
01:19:09,615 --> 01:19:11,149
Nice and hard now.

548
01:19:11,217 --> 01:19:12,884
Now you're getting it.

549
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,670
Now you got it.

550
01:19:16,538 --> 01:19:18,022
Now you got it.

551
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:19,858
(CHOPPING)

552
01:19:22,244 --> 01:19:23,912
It's not gonna bite you.

553
01:19:24,964 --> 01:19:26,464
(CHOPPING)

554
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:46,085
Danny, come here.

555
01:19:55,813 --> 01:19:57,062
Get off this land.

556
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,131
Ma'am, we have it
on good information

557
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,983
that this is the home
of Colonel Morsman Carver.

558
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:02,051
He's my husband.

559
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:03,418
Is he here, ma'am?

560
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,754
No. He's not here.

561
01:20:08,692 --> 01:20:10,493
Search the house, Lieutenant.

562
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,962
Yes, sir. House, march.

563
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:14,763
Show them the hard hand, boys.

564
01:20:21,455 --> 01:20:22,705
Check upstairs.

565
01:20:22,773 --> 01:20:24,406
The cellar's clear.

566
01:20:32,616 --> 01:20:34,050
Where's the Colonel, ma'am?

567
01:20:34,118 --> 01:20:35,085
(SPITS)

568
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:38,121
Mind yourself, Lieutenant.

569
01:20:41,358 --> 01:20:42,892
Where is he, ma'am?

570
01:20:45,363 --> 01:20:47,297
Fire the barns.
Leave the house.

571
01:20:47,364 --> 01:20:49,082
No! Stop!

572
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:51,101
Rose!
No.

573
01:20:51,236 --> 01:20:53,003
ROSE: No!
Colonel!

574
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,224
Where are your men, Colonel?

575
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:00,844
The war is over.
You know the war is over.

576
01:21:00,911 --> 01:21:02,546
(EXCLAIMING)

577
01:21:02,614 --> 01:21:03,780
Where are your men?

578
01:21:03,848 --> 01:21:05,165
I released them.

579
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:06,617
Months ago, I released them.

580
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:07,918
And the cannon?

581
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:11,104
Shattered all to hell.
Abandoned outside Atlanta.

582
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:13,824
Get your hands off me,
you Yankee scum.

583
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:17,411
No! My baby, please!

584
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,847
ROSE: Let go! Let go!

585
01:21:21,316 --> 01:21:22,600
No!

586
01:21:24,836 --> 01:21:27,254
(SCREAMING)
Rose! Let go of me!

587
01:21:27,322 --> 01:21:29,006
Danny, no!

588
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:31,175
Danny! Danny, come back...

589
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:38,783
Danny! Danny, come back!

590
01:21:41,837 --> 01:21:43,705
Oh, God.
Somebody, help me.

591
01:22:15,204 --> 01:22:16,889
You said the house was empty.

592
01:22:22,879 --> 01:22:24,279
You...

593
01:22:24,664 --> 01:22:26,865
You son of a bitch.

594
01:22:27,934 --> 01:22:30,352
God damn you to hell.

595
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:31,970
God damn you to hell.

596
01:22:38,544 --> 01:22:40,562
You said the house was empty!

597
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:43,332
They're Rebs, Captain.

598
01:23:02,587 --> 01:23:04,538
You burned that house.

599
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:07,273
And them in it.

600
01:23:09,977 --> 01:23:11,561
Your turn now.

601
01:23:14,348 --> 01:23:16,566
"For they that take the sword

602
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:21,137
"shall perish
with the sword."

603
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:25,275
(GRUNTS)

604
01:24:02,464 --> 01:24:04,432
Enough! Enough!

605
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:05,900
It's done.

606
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:12,823
(CHOKING)
It's done.

607
01:24:17,562 --> 01:24:21,415
Forty miles to Red Rock City.

608
01:24:21,483 --> 01:24:24,785
You head over that ridge,
you'll be all right.

609
01:24:28,657 --> 01:24:30,741
You keep coming after me,

610
01:24:32,611 --> 01:24:35,597
you ain't going to find
nothing but torment.

611
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:30,174
You will pay for that life,

612
01:27:31,242 --> 01:27:33,660
or you will pay with yours.

613
01:27:35,264 --> 01:27:37,848
I'm going to fill my skin

614
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:40,151
and water the horses,

615
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:41,569
and then I'll be leaving.

616
01:27:41,637 --> 01:27:43,488
That there's life.

617
01:27:44,656 --> 01:27:46,807
Nothing 'round here is free.

618
01:27:48,894 --> 01:27:50,761
Ain't got no gold.

619
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:55,517
You can look for yourself.

620
01:28:03,176 --> 01:28:05,460
How to value a man's life?

621
01:28:09,632 --> 01:28:10,966
How 'bout

622
01:28:12,218 --> 01:28:14,069
one for another?

623
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:20,942
The black one is good.

624
01:28:21,661 --> 01:28:23,595
Leave him.

625
01:28:23,597 --> 01:28:25,147
You may go.

626
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:36,003
"Blessed be the Lord,
my strength.

627
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:39,539
"He teaches my fingers to
fight and my hands to war."

628
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,327
Amen.

629
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:47,815
Come on.

630
01:30:23,801 --> 01:30:26,371
Leave me be, old man.

631
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:27,672
(CHUCKLES)

632
01:30:31,877 --> 01:30:33,611
That your horse?

633
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:34,845
No.

634
01:30:34,913 --> 01:30:36,047
(CLICKS)

635
01:30:37,383 --> 01:30:38,984
It's yours.

636
01:30:56,235 --> 01:30:58,269
Go as you wish.

637
01:30:58,337 --> 01:30:59,921
That which is yours

638
01:30:59,988 --> 01:31:02,073
will always return to you.

639
01:31:03,008 --> 01:31:04,642
That which you take

640
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,962
will always be taken from you.

641
01:31:20,443 --> 01:31:23,179
That's for the water,
not the horse.

642
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:08,469
A man could die out here
if he's not careful.

643
01:33:12,107 --> 01:33:13,574
I didn't see you come up.

644
01:33:13,642 --> 01:33:16,660
That's 'cause you keep
looking behind you.

645
01:33:20,549 --> 01:33:25,453
Perhaps you'd be interested in a little
ration of Madame Louise's Cure All.

646
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:37,064
'Course, some say it's the
demon rum in a fancy bottle,

647
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,885
but it'll cure what ails you.

648
01:33:44,723 --> 01:33:46,524
Thank you kindly.

649
01:33:47,493 --> 01:33:49,695
But I'm afraid

650
01:33:49,763 --> 01:33:52,380
ain't no bottle going to
sort out my troubles.

651
01:33:52,532 --> 01:33:54,400
You men,

652
01:33:54,467 --> 01:33:57,169
you always choosing
a gun over a remedy.

653
01:33:57,237 --> 01:34:00,155
It don't really much
matter what I choose.

654
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:03,659
Got no money either way.

655
01:34:03,726 --> 01:34:05,243
Oh, hell.

656
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:08,897
I never let that stand in
the way of making a deal.

657
01:34:11,301 --> 01:34:12,951
What's wrong
with that .44?

658
01:34:13,019 --> 01:34:14,536
Nothing.

659
01:34:15,889 --> 01:34:17,722
How old's the animal?

660
01:34:19,776 --> 01:34:21,560
I don't really know.

661
01:34:21,627 --> 01:34:23,345
Steal her, did you?

662
01:34:24,497 --> 01:34:25,981
Not exactly.

663
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,233
Spoken like a true sinner.

664
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:32,154
Well, hell, don't
matter much out here.

665
01:34:32,221 --> 01:34:35,708
Man's got to do what a
man's got to do, right?

666
01:34:36,577 --> 01:34:37,577
Yeah.

667
01:34:41,732 --> 01:34:44,233
I suppose we best fix you up.

668
01:34:47,237 --> 01:34:49,122
Cost you the horse.

669
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:02,602
I reckon I ain't getting
out of here, anyway.

670
01:35:02,669 --> 01:35:06,038
Hell, I'll even throw in
a bottle of the curative.

671
01:35:23,624 --> 01:35:24,891
Hey,

672
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:28,212
don't forget your curative.

673
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:15,053
Look at that sun long
enough, you go blind,

674
01:37:17,491 --> 01:37:19,091
or worse,

675
01:37:19,826 --> 01:37:21,059
mad.

676
01:37:26,866 --> 01:37:28,233
What the hell do you want?

677
01:37:28,302 --> 01:37:32,555
I'm just a humble peddler offering
a cure to an ailing world.

678
01:37:32,623 --> 01:37:34,573
I ain't looking for no cure.

679
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:37,193
Why, that's just
what your friend said.

680
01:37:37,195 --> 01:37:38,711
That what he's calling himself?

681
01:37:38,778 --> 01:37:40,862
What would you call him?

682
01:37:42,448 --> 01:37:46,402
Somebody who could use a
taste of that Colt of yourn.

683
01:37:49,589 --> 01:37:51,623
Tell you what, stranger.

684
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:57,114
I got three thirsty
animals over there.

685
01:37:57,181 --> 01:37:59,833
I'll trade you this here steel

686
01:38:00,902 --> 01:38:03,003
for that water you got.

687
01:38:25,426 --> 01:38:27,478
What do you say?

688
01:38:28,412 --> 01:38:30,313
Got us a deal?

689
01:38:31,866 --> 01:38:33,066
Yeah.

690
01:38:37,822 --> 01:38:39,740
Just the one shell?

691
01:38:39,807 --> 01:38:41,858
You looking for more?

692
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,981
I reckon not.

693
01:40:01,223 --> 01:40:03,008
Time was,

694
01:40:03,076 --> 01:40:05,510
you said your war was over.

695
01:40:05,578 --> 01:40:08,663
Only the dead can only
end a war, Captain.

696
01:40:45,235 --> 01:40:46,636
Go on,

697
01:40:47,705 --> 01:40:49,105
finish it.

698
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:20,955
I believe it's up to you, sir.

699
01:41:45,313 --> 01:41:46,447
Rose.

700
01:41:50,285 --> 01:41:51,601
Rose.

701
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:02,830
