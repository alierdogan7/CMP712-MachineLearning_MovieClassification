00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,002
The closest freshwater lake is here, Sir.

180
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,121
St. Andrew bay, about a mile inland.

181
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,757
Good. We'll get the mussels
and be back by sundown.

182
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,676
I want this ship close to shore,

183
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:35,011
somewhere the sub can't and won't dare go.

184
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,797

[Ring] T.A.O.

188
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:43,970
I want the all-clear for our landing party.

189
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:45,889
Anything on subsurface search?

190
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:47,474
Negative, Sir. All's quiet.

191
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:48,514
We can support the landing party

192
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,110
with the .50 cals and the 25-Mike-Mike.

193

At ease.

This is the finest messdecks afloat.

198
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,387
If you can dream it up,
our chefs can whip it up.

199
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,922
Mr. President.

200
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,841
Bernie Cowley, culinary
specialist second class.

201
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:24,394
I'm happy to prepare anything for you.

202
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,430
Gosh, um, I don't know.

203
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:28,815
What did you have for lunch?

204
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,934
Oh, you don't want my diet, Mr. President.

205
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,986
Nothing but grilled vegetables as of yet.

206
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,272
But for you, name it.

207
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:38,325
Well, uh, let me see.

208
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,359
Uh...

209
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,362
I got prime rib, chicken cordon bleu.

210
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:45,365
Well, it, uh, it all
sounds so... so very good.

211
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,200
I just... I don't know where to start.

212
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,703
Mr. President. Sorry to interrupt.

213
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,288
Uh, Lieutenant Mejia, ship's navigator.

214
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,089
We're honored to have you aboard, Sir.

215
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,208
Just wanted to tell you
I'll do whatever I can

216
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,377
to make this ride as smooth as possible.

217
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,045
Well...

218
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,715
Actually just came down here
to say hello to everyone.

219
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,850
Um...

220
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:11,191
I-I think we have to get to
that briefing now, don't we?

221
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:13,393
Yes, Sir.

222
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,133
I'm walking around a
ship full of 20-year-olds

223
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,302
who know exactly what
they're doing at all times,

224

on a mission to save a country
that's barely recognizable.

225
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,757
And me, Mr. President,

226
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,926
I can't figure out what to eat for lunch.

227
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,929
Sir, how many people did
you have working under you

228
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:52,182
when you were secretary of H.U.D?

229
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,267
I know where this is going, Master Chief,

230
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,269
but the last time I made a decision...

231
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,906
The last time you made a
decision was yesterday, Sir,

232
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,242
when you decided to move forward.

233
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,327
And I'll tell you this...

234
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,280
The Navy's been studying
leadership since 1775.

235
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:10,033
Between the captain, the X.O., and myself,

236
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,835
we have 67 years' experience.

237
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,953
Leaders aren't born. They're made.

238
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,791
And we all believe in you, Sir.

239
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,959
Just give yourself time.

[Exhales deeply]

241
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,970
I'd like to have a plan as to how

242
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:35,141
we'll engineer the spore
protein into the vaccine

243
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:37,193
once the mussels arrive.

244
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,729
I was thinking perhaps a stabilizer,

245
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,981
very much like the one that you used

246
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,700
to bind your D.N.A. to the virus.

247
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,069
Ah. The real reason I'm here.

248
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:49,289
You know that viruses don't
like to be tinkered with.

249
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:52,075
They'll loop out any added foreign genes,

250
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:53,493
and somehow, Niels,

251
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,546
you managed to sidestep
the recombination process.

252
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:59,883
Yeah, well, it was so long ago, you know,

253
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,335
and I tried so many.

254
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:05,338
I mean, honestly, Rachel,

255
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,090
who can remember these things?

256
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,509
You know that I took samples of your blood

257
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:10,760
while you were recovering.

258
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,011
You're not really gonna make me

interested is the chiralit...

around offering the cure,

is help finding these bounty hunters.

then what do these people have against you?

They're a cult, naturally
immune to the virus.

535
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,342
All right, Ray.

536
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:19,593
This is it.

537
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:22,963
So how are you supposed to
signal the bounty hunters?

538
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:32,556
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Come on, I hand this to you,

539
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,441
I'm on the next ride back to your ship

540
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:35,976
and you start the party without me.

541
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:37,444
You can't bench me now.

542
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:39,062
Watch me!

543
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:44,234
Now, I don't plan to lose this fight,

544
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,069
but this door opens, and it ain't me,

545
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:48,038
tell those assholes you shot the flare

546
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:49,573
and try to collect the bounty.

547
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:51,158
Bad move, Ray.

548
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,579
[Door rattling]

549
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:57,247
Hey! Come on!

550
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:03,587
[Panting]

551
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:06,256
All teams be aware, Ray is still on land.

552
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,175
I say again, Ray is still on land.

553
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:10,227
He's locked in the trailer.

554
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:22,572
[Static]

555
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:26,026
Tex: Guests of honor are arriving.

556
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:30,280
[Tires screech]

557
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:39,623
[Rapid gunfire, men yelling]

558
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:46,596
Come on, kids.

559
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,470
Hey, where's Cody?

560
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:56,473
He wanted to stay and fight.

561
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:59,359
And you let him? You let him?!

562
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,645
Captain, Cody wasn't on the RHIBs.

563
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:04,731
- Jake covered for him.
- Chandler: I'm Oscar Mike.

564
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:06,199
Gotta go find Cody.

565
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:18,995
[Radio chatter]

566
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:21,665
Captain is out of pocket. Keep an eye out.

567
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,000
Can we get a fix on
them? Can we triangulate?

568
00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:26,336
[Bullets ricochet] Cody!

569
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:32,392
Burk, I read two tangos
falling back up the road.

570
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:35,061
Burk: We'll try to capture them alive!

571
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:36,480
[Men shouting indistinctly]

572
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:37,597
Cody!

573
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,017
25 Mike-Mike has hostiles in range.

574
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,769
Kara: Batteries release mount 2-5-2.

575
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,988
Slattery: T.A.O., prepare
mount 5-1 for fire support.

576
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:46,606
Kara: Aye, Sir.

577
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,191
Cody!

578
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:57,784
[Bullets ricochet]

579
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:59,169
Uhh! [Thud]

580
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:01,371
Wolf: Clear to move, Captain.

581
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:04,424
Burk: Tangos captured. Copy that.

582
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,926
[Men shouting indistinctly]

583
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,545
Danny: Guys, I'm taking
heavy gunfire up here.

584
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,547
Hostiles are 20 yards north of my whiskey.

585
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,849
Give me a fire-control solution and engage.

586
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:15,218
Kara: Cobra team, stand
by for one round inbound.

587
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:31,735
[Gunfire continues]

588
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:33,620
[Bullets ricocheting]

589
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:36,289
[Exhales sharply] Can't find Cody anywhere.

590
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:38,325
Burk: Look in the cannery.
That's his go-to spot.

591
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:39,826
Kara: Surface, T.A.O.

592
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,912
Adjust 10 yards east. Fire one round.

593
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:44,247
[Whirs, blast]

594
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,758
[Gunfire continues]

595
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:01,147
Cody?

596
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:15,829
[Door creaks]

597
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,543
[Gun cocks]

598
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:31,795
Gotcha.

599
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:34,214
Bosses want you alive...

600
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,516
Unless you put up a fight.

601
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:38,802
Please?

602
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:40,854
Put up a fight.

603
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:45,859
[Click, squish] [Gasps]

604
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:47,694
[Groans softly]

605
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:48,945
[Gasps]

606
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:50,730
[Groans]

607
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,616
[Thud]

608
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,337
[Radio static] Tex: Tangos neutralized.

609
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,242
We have prisoners as requested.

610
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,758
Repeat, tango is neutralized.

611
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,427
[Static]

612
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,149
Find what you were looking for?

613
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:00,360
The mussels.

614
00:34:00,362 --> 00:34:03,530
Oh, y-yes. They were a tremendous help.

615
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:04,615
Thank you.

616
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,334
And I'm sorry to hear about the boy.

617
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:10,204
And what about Niels?

618
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:14,208
I think we're on the verge
of a real breakthrough.

619
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,212
Well, then don't let me slow you down.

620
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:25,435
Can't blame the captain
for what happened to Cody.

621
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:27,387
I can't blame anyone. That's the point.

622
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,856
- Hey.
- What?

623
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:30,724
What do you want from me?

624
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,863
Nothing.

625
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:37,114
Never mind.

626
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:39,233
Okay.

627
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,320
[Clank]

628
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,291
I was stationed in the
west bank for three years,

629
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:50,744
another two in gaza. [Panting]

630
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,830
Thought I'd seen everything.

631
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:57,668
Then this pandemic broke out.

632
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,587
And I thought,

633
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:04,675
you know, maybe now we
have this common enemy.

634
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:09,596
We even have this cure that
we want to give to people.

635
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:14,434
Maybe, just maybe, we'll
stop killing each other.

636
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:20,073
But nothing's changed.

637
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:23,160
It's all the same.

638
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,033
[Sighs]

639
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:32,119
Chandler: We captured three immunes.

640
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:33,787
They were all carrying these.

641
00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:39,676
You ever see any of
Ramsey's people use one?

642
00:35:39,712 --> 00:35:42,129
I didn't realize cell
towers were up and running.

643
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,430
They're not, Mr. President.

644
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:44,881
We haven't picked up a signal in months,

645
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,801
and none of these phones
have a single call or text.

646
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:50,520
But they were charged.
They're using them somehow.

647
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:53,807
You said they were trying to
set up a communication network.

648
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,560
- This must be it.
- Slattery: Our techs are on it.

649
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,312
Meantime, we're gonna
lean on our prisoners,

650
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,947
see what else we can get out of 'em.

651
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,901
This is good work.

652
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,538
But if we're gonna win
this war, we need a plan.

653
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,824
First order of business...

654
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,660
Show our fellow Americans
that we aren't the bad guys,

655
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:15,996
despite the lies that
Sean Ramsey's spreading.

656
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:18,915
Once in New Orleans, we
inoculate the survivors.

657
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,252
We make it clear that the
American government is back

658
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:24,221
and that we're on their side.

659
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:30,427
The survivors most likely
are living offshore on boats.

660
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,229
We need an evacuation plan

661
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:34,648
in case the Ramseys are closing in.

662
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:38,518
By now, those boats may have
exhausted their fuel supplies,

663
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,356
so I suggest that we stockpile
fuel from local stations...

664
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:46,994
[Helicopter blades whirring in distance]

665
00:36:57,456 --> 00:37:01,925
We got some intel on a
safe zone not far from here.

666
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:08,765
Could be a good place for you
and your people to resettle.

667
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:11,218
Helo's warming up.

668
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,438
I was gonna check it out.

669
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:16,723
Wanna take a ride?

670
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,233
I knew Cody was amped up to join the fight.

671
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,868
He never would have stayed behind

672
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,903
if I'd gone along like you said.

673
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,465
There's an old saying.

674
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:41,915
"Anyone can hold the helm
when the sea is calm."

675
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:47,587
Being a leader is not about being perfect.

676
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,843
It's about weathering
the storm and carrying on.

677
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:05,655
[Voice breaks] I just wanna go home.

678
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,524
I know, son.

679
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,994
[Inhales and exhales deeply]

680
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:13,780
We all do.

681
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:16,450
Feel better?

682
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:18,285
Yes. Thank you.

683
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,120
My arm was really bruising. [Chuckles]

684
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:23,423
You know, there was much
times on the <i>Vyerni</i>

685
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:26,543
when I thought about a moment like this.

686
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:29,129
Did you?

687
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,299
Well, I must admit, we're
quite a team, you and I.

688
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,768
A team with cause for celebration.

689
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:37,471
We solved our nebulizing problem.

690
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,772
Yes. Well, I mean,

691
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:41,274
we still need to find a factory somewhere

692
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,276
we can mass-produce the powder.

693
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:44,978
And we need planes, lots
of planes. [Rats squeaking]

694
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,614
You know, I always wanted
to get my pilot's license.

695
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:50,734
Actually, we don't have
need for any of that...

696
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,953
No planes,

697
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:54,154
no factories,

698
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,622
no powder even.

699
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:56,907
I don't understand.

700
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,625
How do you want to spread the vaccine?

701
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,627
Well, if you think about it,

702
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:03,046
you were able to kill 5 billion people

703
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,582
- simply by breathing.
- I...

704
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,801
So the key to transmission lies within you.

705
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:10,587
If I could teach healthy lungs

706
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,973
to hold and reproduce the cure

707
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:16,343
the same way yours do with the
virus, well, then I could...

708
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,829
You could make the cure contagious.

709
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,332
Of course, the trick would be

710
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,334
understanding just how your body does it,

711
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,753
to be able to compare
the D.N.A. sequence change

712
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,371
between yours and the primordial.

713
00:39:26,423 --> 00:39:27,673
[Rats squeak]

714
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,207
You have my blood samples.

715
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,959
I do. [Sets down box]

716
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:32,794
The problem is, is the virus.

717
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:36,381
It resides exclusively in
your lungs, as we both know.

718
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:38,550
That's the reason why it's so contagious.

719
00:39:38,602 --> 00:39:41,053
So, what do we do? You
wanna to take a biopsy?

720
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,387
No. No, no. No.

721
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,473
See, that wouldn't
work, because it's likely

722
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:46,692
in the deepest recesses of your lungs,

723
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:50,395
mixed in with thousands
of other innocuous viruses,

724
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,981
so what I'm gonna need to do is

725
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:55,400
just flush out the poisonous one.

726
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,970
- Flush it out? How?
- Well, you remember

727
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,422
those brilliant little D.N.A. scissors?

728
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:04,127
Well, they're not only
capable of adding a gene.

729
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:05,413
They can also remove one.

730
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:08,332
So I'm gonna undo what you did.

731
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,584
I'm gonna separate your gene

732
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,672
from the virus inside your body.

733
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,958
[Laughs] I'm sorry, but
that would never work.

734
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:19,677
[Gloves snap] Well, yes, actually it will,

735
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,713
if they have identical stability
sequences on either side,

736
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,932
and...

737
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,851
[Sighs deeply]

738
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:29,970
You gave me yours.

739
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:33,140
That would kill me.

740
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:34,558
The gene would be liberated,

741
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,894
and the virus would
explode out of your lungs

742
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:38,696
and into the rest of your body,

743
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,147
and, well...

744
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,116
[Chuckles]

745
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,869
There's just so much of it.

746
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:48,572
If you think I would just allow you to...

747
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:51,075
I mean, you are completely insane!

748
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:53,961
I've already done it, Niels.

749
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:57,415
The virus is doing its work as we speak.

750
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,426
[Equipment clatters]

751
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:09,760
[Niels grunting]

752
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,178
O'Connor: What's going on in there?

753
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,765
The people on this ship
will sleep better tonight,

754
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:17,268
knowing that it died with you.

755
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,769
Miller: Dr. Scott, are you all right?

756
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:20,237
I helped you.

757
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:21,906
Yes, you did.

758
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,445
- Miller: Dr. Scott!
- You're gonna help all of us.

759
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:28,946
[Gasping and gurgling]

760
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,952
[Gasping]
