1
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,700
One! One!

2
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,000
One, two, one!

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,800
<i>"Dear Mother.
I hope you are keeping well...</i>

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>and not worrying too much about me.</i>

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,100
<i>You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...</i>

6
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,800
<i>for they are collecting
such a force here...</i>

7
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,100
<i>that an attack would be insane.</i>

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,700
<i>The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.</i>

9
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...</i>

10
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
<i>ready to fight for their country...</i>

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,100
<i>as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.</i>

12
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,700
<i>But this time we must make it
a whole country...</i>

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,100
<i>for all who live here,
so that all can speak.</i>

14
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
<i>Before this war began...</i>

15
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,700
<i>many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.</i>

16
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,000
<i>Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.</i>

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,100
<i>We fight for men and women...</i>

18
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,100
<i>whose poetry is not yet written,
but which will presently...</i>

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,100
<i>be as enviable
and as renowned as any.</i>

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,300
<i>Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.</i>

21
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
<i>But we are not disheartened.</i>

22
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.</i>

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>They have made me captain,
of which I am enormously proud.</i>

24
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,600
<i>You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...</i>

25
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,500
<i>most of whom are older than I am.</i>

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,600
<i>Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.</i>

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>His words come home to me
like truth...</i>

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,200
<i>'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...</i>

29
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,500
<i>that the heart's blessing
can heal...</i>

30
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,700
<i>and that love
can overcome all odds. '</i>

31
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>My dearest love to Father.</i>

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
<i>Your son, Robert."</i>

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Charge!
Company, forward!

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,300
Charge!
Company, forward!

35
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,500
- Charge!
- Fire!

36
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,300
Fire!

37
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,300
Aim!

38
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Fire!

39
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Stand. Fire!

40
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
Steady, boys!

41
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,200
- Forward!
- Fire!

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,800
Forward, men!

43
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
For God's sake, come on!

44
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,200
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!

45
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
No! Forbes!

46
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,500
Forbes!

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,200
Charge!

48
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
Fire!

49
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
You all right there, Captain?

50
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Please! Not my leg!

51
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,800
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!

52
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Stop!

53
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
No! Wait!

54
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,100
- No!
- Hold on!

55
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
So it's your neck?

56
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,100
The surgeons are busy,
but I'll fix you up.

57
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,000
- Let me know if I hurt you.
- Stop!

58
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
Ah, this is nothing.

59
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,900
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?

60
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,500
I heard it from a friend
who's a dispatch rider...

61
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,800
who got it from one of Stanton's clerks
in the War Office.

62
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,900
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.

63
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,800
Gonna free the slaves.

64
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,500
- What?
- Maybe not in the border states...

65
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
but he will free some, anyway.

66
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,500
My God.

67
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,400
He said he would have done it sooner,
only he was waiting for a big vicfory...

68
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,600
which is, I guess, what this is.

69
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, my God!

70
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,900
Please don't cut anymore, please!

71
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,100
Please!

72
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,300
This might hurt you, Captain.
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Dashing.

74
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
- Robert.
- Thomas.

75
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,400
Captain Shaw.
I was so proud when I heard.

76
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,600
They had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.

77
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,400
- And Forbes?
- Impossible, as always.

78
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,700
He's here somewhere.

79
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
How about you?

80
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,000
Working for your father,
helping him with the resettlement...

81
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
for the Freedmen's Relief Association.

82
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,800
There's a shortage of housing.
Robert! Are you all right?

83
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Yes. I'm sorry.

84
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.

85
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,800
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch of slaves...

86
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,200
called them contraband
and put them in camps like cattle.

87
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,100
The War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.

88
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,500
Ot course they deserted.
So would I.

89
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,700
Robert. Governor,
you know my son Robert.

90
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,700
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Andrew.

91
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,200
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?

92
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,700
Mr. Douglass.

93
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
I understand you were at Antietam.

94
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,900
A great and a terrible day.

95
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,800
I could use your help.

96
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,400
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment of Negro soldiers.

97
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,400
No. It was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass...

98
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
We will offer pride and dignity...

99
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,100
to those who have known
only degradation.

100
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,000
- Colored soldiers. Just think of it.
- Wonderful.

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,700
I've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...

102
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,000
of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry.

103
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Thank you, Governor.
That's...

104
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,000
It's a wondertul idea.

105
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,100
Excuse me.

106
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,800
Well done, Shaw.

107
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,200
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.

108
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
What's the matter?
Too much punch?

109
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,700
I know how much you'd like to
make colonel, but a colored regiment?

110
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,700
You know how popular that would be?

111
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,500
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?

112
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,600
Hey, Robert.

113
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,400
What's wrong?

114
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,800
I'm gonna do it.

115
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
You're not serious.

116
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,700
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

117
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,300
And you?

118
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,600
Can you picture me
in charge of a regiment?

119
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,400
Picture me in charge of anything.

120
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I would be honored to have you.

121
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,100
Then you're an idiot.

122
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,900
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?

123
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,300
So it seems.

124
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,400
Then I am your first volunteer.

125
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,400
Present arms!

126
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,700
How do we look, Colonel?
We gonna whup the Secess'?

127
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,500
When do we get the blue suit?

128
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, the blue suit.

129
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,300
Ready to whip them Rebs.

130
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,100
When are we gonna get to fight?

131
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Are we really gonna get to fight
this time?

132
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,700
Attention!

133
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,600
Morning.

134
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Good morning, gentlemen.

135
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,400
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.

136
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,300
I am your commanding officer.

137
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,900
It is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.

138
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,700
It is my hope that the same courage...

139
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200
spirit and honor...

140
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,600
which has brought us together...

141
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,800
will one day restore this Union.

142
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
May God bless us all!

143
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,700
Form companies?

144
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,000
We will commence
with forming companies.

145
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Company officers, take charge.

146
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,300
You recruits will report
to your respective officers...

147
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,500
by the letter of your company
in alphabetical order...

148
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,100
which is in the top left-hand corner
of your muster sheet.

149
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,500
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.

150
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,000
Name's Searles. Thomas Searles.

151
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,700
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?

152
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,400
It's a collection of essays...
Fourier, Emerson...

153
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
all the transcendentalists.

154
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,800
It got pictures?

155
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
- Teach me?
- Yes, I'd be happy to.

156
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,900
Look at what's walking in here!

157
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
I'd rather have a hog
than a nigger.

158
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,100
- At least you could eat the hog!
- Getting dark mighty early around here.

159
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Show us a little dance,
nigger boys!

160
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Sergeant of the Guard,
post your sentry.

161
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Yes, sir!

162
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,900
Wait, no. That's my space, nigger.

163
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I sleep better close by the door.

164
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,800
I prefer a space
with more reading light.

165
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh, I like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.

166
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
I'd be happy to teach you.

167
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,800
It would be my pleasure.

168
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,500
Look, snowflake, I ain't got nothing
to learn from no house nigger.

169
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,000
I am a free man,
as was my father.

170
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,100
Good. Move your free black ass
before I bust it up.

171
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.

172
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,000
It's all right.

173
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll be fine over here.

174
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,100
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.

175
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,800
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.

176
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,500
Ain't no blue suit for the black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.

177
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,100
Well, we soldiers now.

178
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Where you from, field hand?

179
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,300
South Carolina.

180
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,700
You ought to know better, boy.

181
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,100
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.

182
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
What's your name?

183
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
I said what's your name, boy?

184
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,300
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?

185
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,300
He's mute.

186
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,300
You mean this child can't talk?

187
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,700
Hey, come over here, hon.

188
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?

189
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,300
What about you, buck?
Whereabouts you from?

190
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm from around Tennessee.

191
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,800
Ran away when I was 12 years old,
and I ain't never look back.

192
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,000
What you doing since then?

193
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,100
I run for president.

194
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
I didn't win though.

195
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Boy.

196
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,100
Major? Forbes.
That's you.

197
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,500
- Thomas.
- Hello.

198
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,000
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.

199
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
- Thomas Searles.
- Captain.

200
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,900
So how was your meal?

201
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,100
The remoulade was a trifle tart...

202
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,500
but the souffle for dessert
more than made up for it.

203
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,400
And your comrades?

204
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,300
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.

205
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,800
Major Forbes!

206
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,200
- A word, please.
- Oh, excuse me, Thomas.

207
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
Yes, Robert?

208
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,800
I won't permit
that kind of fraternization.

209
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,500
- It's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.

210
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,500
You're right, of course.

211
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,600
I've sent for help.

212
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,800
These men need a proper teacher.

213
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,300
For God's sake, you march like
a bunch of crippled old goats!

214
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,500
We're gonna be here day and night
till we get this right!

215
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,000
One, one. Company, halt.

216
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,100
About-face!

217
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,600
You are ugly Mexican-African
fucking whores!

218
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,100
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen!

219
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,700
Forward at the half step. March!

220
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,600
One! You half-wit black bastard.

221
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Is it true they cut your balls off
at birth?

222
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,200
I'll work on you
till I get you broken.

223
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
Company, halt!

224
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Do you not know your right
from your left?

225
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
No, sir.

226
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,300
How many here do not know
right from left?

227
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
Jesus, have pity.

228
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
This is your front!

229
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,800
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this...

230
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,200
Now you're learning, boy-o.

231
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,900
Company, forward march!

232
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,100
One!

233
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,800
- Two!
- One! Two!

234
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,200
You bloody Hindus, get it right!

235
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Stop. Start it again.
In each rank! Count!

236
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,700
Left. Left, right, left!

237
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,800
Right, forward, march!

238
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,100
Left. Get your goddamn hand
out of your pocket!

239
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,400
Bonny Prince Charlie!
Are you a gentleman?

240
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Are you a member of congress
or something?

241
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,300
Or are you the bloody
prince of Africa?

242
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't look at me!
Look straight ahead!

243
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
I'll heat your ass up, boy-o!

244
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,300
The Irish are not noted
for their fondness for the coloreds.

245
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
What about the uniforms?

246
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,800
Still no word.

247
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,700
Rifles?

248
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,200
See to it.

249
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,700
You're a big buck, aren't you?
You've got a lot to learn!

250
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
You haven't had a master like me!

251
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,800
<i>"Dear Mother.
The men learn very quickly.</i>

252
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,600
<i>Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.</i>

253
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
<i>They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...</i>

254
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,000
<i>and they restrain themselves.</i>

255
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
<i>But the moment they are dismissed
from drill...</i>

256
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,800
<i>every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible...</i>

257
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>and you would not know from the sound
of it that this is an army camp.</i>

258
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,700
<i>They must have learned this from long
hours of meaningless, inhuman work...</i>

259
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,500
<i>to set their minds free so quickly.</i>

260
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,800
<i>It gives them great energy.</i>

261
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,200
<i>There is no doubt
that we will leave this state...</i>

262
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
<i>as fine a regiment
as any that has marched.</i>

263
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
<i>As ever, your son, Robert."</i>

264
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,000
They've done it.

265
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,100
Assemble the men.

266
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Attention!

267
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,000
Attention!

268
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,300
Battalion!

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,900
In accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...

270
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,700
you men are advised...

271
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,300
that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.

272
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,400
It reads:

273
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
"Any Negro taken in arms...

274
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,200
against the Confederacy...

275
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,200
will immediately be returned
to a state of slavery.

276
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,300
Any Negro taken in Federal uniform...

277
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,500
will be summarily put to death.

278
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,600
Any white officer taken
in command of Negro troops...

279
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,900
shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...

280
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,500
and shall likewise be put to death."

281
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Full discharges will be granted
in the morning...

282
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,400
to all those who apply.

283
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,900
Dismissed.

284
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,100
It you're not here in the morning...

285
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,000
I understand.

286
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,100
Still want that blue suit, nigger?

287
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,800
- Good morning, Major.
- Sir! Formed and ready, sir.

288
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
How many are left?

289
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,400
Attention!

290
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,500
Battalion!

291
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,000
Glory hallelujah.

292
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
Company, halt!

293
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,200
You're not dismissed, boy-o!
Get up!

294
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,100
You'll fall out when I say
and not before. Understand? Get up!

295
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,200
Sergeant Major.

296
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,000
- Sir!
- At ease, Sergeant.

297
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,600
I have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcany.

298
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,500
I wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.

299
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,600
You disagree.

300
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,900
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?

301
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
We grew up together, yes.

302
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,500
Let him grow up some more.

303
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,400
- I see.
- Will that be all, sir?

304
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Dismissed.

305
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,900
.57 caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.

306
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,300
Sharts.

307
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,400
One, one, nine, one, one.

308
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,100
Can you handle that?

309
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,000
I can knock something down
with this.

310
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,400
Trip.

311
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,900
One, two, one, nine, two.

312
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,200
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.

313
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,300
One, two, one, eight, six.

314
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,700
- Jefterson.
- Yes, sir!

315
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Robert.

316
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,300
Finally.
There's a rumor going around...

317
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,900
that we're to be used
only for manual labor.

318
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,800
I can't believe the things we hear.

319
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,100
It's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to fight.

320
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
The men are living for that day.

321
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,800
I know I am.

322
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,500
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.

323
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,300
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.

324
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,800
For God's sake, come on!

325
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,000
- Good shot!
- Do that again!

326
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,800
Give him your weapon.
Do that again.

327
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,800
- One dime he can't do it.
- Dime on each of you!

328
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,200
That's a bet!
Go on, boy.

329
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,200
Go ahead, Sharts.

330
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,600
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nofhing!

331
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,700
Attention, company!

332
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,100
Attention, company!

333
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,500
As you were.

334
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,400
Front and center.

335
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
You are a good shot, Private.

336
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Thank you, sir.
Squirrel hunting.

337
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,800
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.

338
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,200
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,400
Reload.

340
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,800
Faster.

341
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,700
Faster.

342
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,300
Discharge your weapon.

343
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,600
Discharge your weapon.

344
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,800
Do it!

345
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,100
Now, do it again. Only this time,
I want it done quickly.

346
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,100
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.

347
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,600
Major Forbes, give me
your Colt revolver.

348
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
- What?
- Your gun.

349
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,400
Give it to me.

350
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Faster.

351
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,100
Reload.

352
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,100
Quickly. Faster!

353
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,700
Faster! Load.

354
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,000
Do it! Do it!

355
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,800
Teach them properly, Major.

356
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,100
Yes, sir.

357
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,700
Attention, company!

358
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,600
Ready!

359
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,100
Aim!

360
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Fire!

361
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,000
Good morning, Major.
You're up early.

362
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,100
I want to talk to you.

363
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,000
Certainly.

364
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,700
If you wouldn't mind
getting down from your horse.

365
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,800
- Better?
- Why do you treat the men this way?

366
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
How should I treat them?

367
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,000
Like men?

368
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,200
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?

369
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:07,300
He's not a very good soldier.
I'm getting these men ready for battle.

370
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,900
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.

371
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,400
They march well.
They're disciplined.

372
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,600
- No thanks to you.
- I beg your pardon?

373
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,200
You heard me.

374
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,200
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?

375
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,100
You seem to forget I know you
and so does Thomas.

376
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
If you don't believe in
what we're doing here...

377
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
maybe you shouldn't be part of it.

378
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,000
Part of what?

379
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,600
Huh?

380
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,200
Left, right! Little finger
along the seams of your trousers?

381
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,100
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.

382
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,400
It is my job...

383
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,300
to get these men ready.

384
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,000
And I will.

385
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,400
They have risked their lives to be here.
They have given up their freedom.

386
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,000
I owe them as much as they have given.
I owe them my freedom...

387
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,500
my life, if necessary.

388
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,400
Maybe so do you, Cabot.

389
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,900
I think you do.

390
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,300
Develop! En garde.

391
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,200
Thrust! Develop!

392
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,900
You're not at dancing school!
Take his head off!

393
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,500
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What have we here?

394
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,600
Bonny Prince Charlie
and his toy bayonet.

395
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,000
You're not reading now.
Go on. Get over!

396
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
- Now stab me.
- What?

397
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Stab me.

398
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,400
Come on. Stab! Not tickle.
Hit me!

399
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Come on! You prissy schoolgirl!

400
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
You're the worst soldier
in this company! Hit me!

401
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,500
No shame, son. Get up.

402
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,300
- I said get up!
- Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.

403
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,600
Sergeant, deal with that man.

404
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,100
I'll tell you a wee secret, son.
Learn to keep your mouth shut.

405
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Save it, son.
Save it.

406
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,300
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcany.

407
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,100
Robert.

408
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,100
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, it I may.

409
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,600
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...

410
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
must first get permission.

411
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,100
You understand, Private?

412
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,800
Yes, sir.

413
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,500
En garde! Thrust! Develop! Recover!

414
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,900
You better put some oomph
into that, boy-o!

415
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh, my, my, my.

416
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,300
Some things never change.

417
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,200
I guess the whole world
hate the nigger.

418
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,700
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here...

419
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,200
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?

420
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,400
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.

421
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,500
He a swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.

422
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,200
But he in the same boat
with us.

423
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,400
Secess' come, take him, kill him too.

424
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Huh. Not him.

425
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,000
He a swell.

426
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,700
He just a boy.

427
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,900
He a weak white boy.

428
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,700
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.

429
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Ain't that right, snowflake?

430
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,200
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point.

431
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Onliest reason he in charge
is 'cause his mommy and daddy fixed it.

432
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,900
Ain't that so?

433
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,900
You thought he was different,
didn't you?

434
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,800
Hmm?

435
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,800
What you think now?

436
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,600
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you?

437
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
You in the real school now, though,
ain't you?

438
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,300
What you gonna do? Cry?

439
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,100
Yeah. He sure enough learning now,
ain't he?

440
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,000
Attention, company!

441
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,500
Forward, march!
Right face.

442
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,900
Oh, shit.

443
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,100
Man say there's a farm,
ain't but two or three miles from here.

444
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,100
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.

445
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
She said, if he bring his friends,
she feed them too.

446
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,200
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, Buck?

447
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,600
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.

448
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,300
I'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.

449
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,200
Nigger, is you a old man or old woman?
I forget.

450
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,100
All right.

451
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Collard greens.

452
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,600
Corn bread.

453
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Come on. Dream.

454
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm waiting on you.

455
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,500
<i>"Dear Mother. News today
of the defeat at Fredericksburg.</i>

456
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,500
<i>If things continue to go badly,
I wonder if I might not end my days...</i>

457
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,700
<i>as an outlaw leader
of a band of fugitive slaves.</i>

458
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,900
<i>Try as I may,
I don 't know these men...</i>

459
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,600
<i>their music, their camaraderie...</i>

460
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
<i>which is different from ours.</i>

461
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,900
<i>I am placed in a position where,
if I were a man of real strength...</i>

462
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,000
<i>I might do a great deal.</i>

463
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,300
<i>But I am afraid I shall show
that I'm not of much account.</i>

464
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,900
<i>I don't want to stand in their way
because of my own weakness.</i>

465
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,400
<i>I miss Christmas on the Shaw Island
and the smell of the sea."</i>

466
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,700
It's Thomas.

467
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
I just wanted to say...

468
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
I wanted to say...

469
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,100
Merry Christmas, Robert.

470
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,800
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

471
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,500
You're Shaw, aren't you?
Merry Christmas.

472
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,400
Kendrick, division quartermaster.

473
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,800
This sorry piece of work is Haggis.

474
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,400
He writes vouchers.

475
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,300
Pleasure.

476
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,400
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, very well. Thank you.

477
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,500
That's all right. Brass are all up
to Division, planning the next disaster.

478
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,600
You're among friends.

479
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
How much longer do you figure
they'll last?

480
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,600
I hear they're deserting
ten at a time.

481
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh, you're misinformed.
We haven't had a single incident.

482
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,500
I figure the nigs never had it so good.

483
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,000
Three square a day,
a roof over their heads.

484
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,500
They gotta know nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am I right?

485
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes, of course.

486
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
It there's anything you need...

487
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
a bottle for the cold nights...

488
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,800
Actually, I put in a requisition
for shoes two weeks ago...

489
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,500
and I haven't heard anything.

490
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,800
Well, provisionally speaking...

491
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,100
we're extremely limited as to footwear.

492
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
That kind of item has to be reserved...

493
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,400
for those units
whose fighting readiness...

494
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,400
supersede yours.

495
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,700
You understand.

496
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,800
Yes, I understand.

497
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,300
- Excuse me.
- Stop by tomorrow.

498
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,200
I have got the most delicious
local jam. Myrtle berry, isn't it?

499
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,800
- Blueberry.
- Right, right.

500
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,500
Nice meeting you, Shaw.

501
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Twit.

502
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,700
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

503
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,700
We've caught a deserter.

504
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,400
Oh, Lordy, this is bad.

505
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,600
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?

506
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,100
Lt'll be all right...

507
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,900
won't it?

508
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,700
Re-form your ranks!

509
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,300
- Re-form your ranks!
- Form your ranks!

510
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,200
Fall in.
Quiet in the ranks.

511
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,900
Quiet in the ranks!

512
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,000
Untie his hands
and take off his coat.

513
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,800
The prisoner is in position, sir.

514
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,900
What is this?

515
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,900
The prisoner is to be flogged
before the entire regiment.

516
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,200
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.

517
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,600
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcany.
- At your pleasure, Colonel.

518
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,700
Never question my authority
in front of ofhers.

519
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,800
Well, I is sorry, massa.

520
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,900
You be the boss man now,
and all us chilluns must learn to obey.

521
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,100
Major Forbes, stand at attention!

522
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,900
Sergeant Mulcany.

523
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,800
You may commence.

524
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,500
Proceed.

525
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,300
Attention.

526
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,500
Mr. Rawlins.

527
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
This morning I...

528
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,700
It would be a great help
if I could talk to you...

529
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,000
about the men from time to time.

530
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,800
That's all.

531
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,100
Shoes, sir.

532
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,300
The men need shoes.

533
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,800
I know. I've been after
the quartermaster for some time.

534
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,700
Now, sir. Now.

535
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,100
The boy was off trying to find hisself
some shoes, Colonel.

536
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,200
He wants to fight...

537
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,700
same as the rest of us.

538
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
More, even.

539
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,300
All of the men, like this?

540
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,300
Yes, sir. Most of them.

541
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,800
Good atternoon, Colonel.

542
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,500
Change your mind about that bottle?

543
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,400
I want 600 pair of shoes
and 1,200 pair of socks...

544
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,900
and anything else
you've been holding out on us.

545
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,000
- You piece of rat filth.
- I'd love to help you.

546
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,800
- But we just don't have any.
- Not for niggers, you don't.

547
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,400
- Not for anybody.
- I see. Pity.

548
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,500
I'll just look and see
that you haven't misplaced them.

549
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,200
Son of a bitch!

550
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,400
- Damn it! You can't...
- Can't I?

551
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,500
I'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.

552
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers...

553
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,300
without proper shoes
because you think it's funny?

554
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,000
Where would that power come from?

555
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,100
All right. Calm down.

556
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,100
Look, have a drink.

557
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,100
Hey, you barefoot men!

558
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,400
Get over here!

559
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,200
Shoes!

560
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,100
Have a pair.

561
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,300
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.

562
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,300
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.

563
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,600
Steward, is there anything you need?

564
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,000
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.

565
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,100
Yes, sir. I will.

566
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,700
Shoulder arms!

567
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,800
Sir.

568
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,800
From the War Department.

569
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,200
Can anything be done?

570
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,000
- They've got families.
- I know.

571
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,700
We'll protest this
through channels later on.

572
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,400
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,100
Attention, battalion!

574
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,900
You men enlisted in this regiment...

575
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,900
on the understanding...

576
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,500
that you would be paid
the regular army wage...

577
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,400
of $13 a month.

578
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,700
This morning I have been notified...

579
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,100
that since you are a colored regiment,
you will be paid $10 a month.

580
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,600
That ain't fair.
They said 13.

581
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,000
Regiment, fall out
by company to receive pay.

582
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,400
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.

583
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,300
Ten dollar a lof of money.

584
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,100
Hey, pop, you titting to lay down
for this too?

585
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,400
Fall in!

586
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,500
Hey. Come on.
Where's your pride, now?

587
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,600
Make your mark right here.

588
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,200
I can write my name.

589
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,200
- Then do it.
- They gonna give us but ten?

590
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,100
You gonna go for that?

591
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,500
A colored soldier stop a bullet
just as good as a white one!

592
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,300
And for less money too!

593
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,800
Yeah! Uncle Abe got hisself
a real bargain here!

594
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,900
- What you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!

595
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,800
Make your mark.
Get your slave wages!

596
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,200
All you good colored boys,
sign up.

597
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,100
That's right. Tear it up!

598
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,000
Tear it up!

599
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,000
If you men will take no pay...

600
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,500
then none of us will.

601
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,800
Let's hear it for the colonel!

602
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,900
Attention, battalion!

603
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,400
Eyes right!

604
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,600
Eyes front!

605
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,800
Eyes...

606
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,400
right.

607
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Man, I forgot how hot
it was down here.

608
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,600
Welcome home, boy.

609
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,900
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.

610
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,500
It's all a memory
now that the North man come.

611
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,300
Now that we come.

612
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,400
Colonel Shaw?

613
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,700
Edward Pierce, special assignment
from Harper's Weekly.

614
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,300
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.

615
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,800
A million loyal readers want to know
what happens when the 54th sees action.

616
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,200
A million and one.

617
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,100
Well, you'll want to see this.

618
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,900
Attention, company!

619
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,600
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!

620
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,800
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment
was formed with the promise...

621
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,000
that only white ofticers
would be commissioned to lead it.

622
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,700
Nothing was mentioned, however,
about noncommissioned ofticers.

623
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,200
Therefore, in recognition ot initiative
taken not only for yourself...

624
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,500
but on behalf
of the entire regiment...

625
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,000
you are hereby awarded the rank
of sergeant major.

626
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,900
Congratulations.

627
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

628
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,300
Congratulations.

629
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,700
I ain't sure
I'm wanting this, Colonel.

630
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,000
I know exactly how you feel.

631
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,600
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!

632
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,200
That's right. Ain't no dream.

633
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,900
We run away slaves,
but we come back fightin' men.

634
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,600
Go tell your folks how kingdom come
in the year of jubilee!

635
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,700
Left! Up tight up there!

636
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,900
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands right out of the fields.

637
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,500
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.

638
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,800
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.

639
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,700
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.

640
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,000
Even talk like the buckra soldier.

641
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,500
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.

642
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,900
We were slaves in the field when
the Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.

643
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,700
How you like the army, contraband?

644
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,700
We love it.
We thank the Lord every day...

645
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,000
for the good vittles
and these beautiful clothes.

646
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,700
Tell true, old man.
This year, every day like Christmas.

647
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,700
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.

648
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,800
My country, 'tis of thee

649
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,900
Sweet land of liberty

650
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,300
Of thee I sing

651
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:13,600
Land where my father died

652
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,900
Land of the pilgrims' pride

653
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,600
From every mountainside

654
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,200
Let freedom ring

655
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,400
Splendid.

656
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,900
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation of your arrival.

657
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,000
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.

658
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,500
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.

659
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,100
Hired a group of New Englanders to teach
our colored how to read and write.

660
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,500
Just your sort of people,
I should think.

661
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Your regiment should enjoy
their stay here.

662
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,400
Yes, I'm sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.

663
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,800
Yes, well, can't promise you
much action.

664
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,900
Just having the coloreds around seems to
have scared the bejesus out of the Rebs.

665
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,200
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.

666
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,900
I'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.

667
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,000
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.

668
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,900
- It's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- A pleasure.

669
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,500
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.

670
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,300
- I know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.

671
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,300
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.

672
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,300
He's your brigade commander.

673
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,200
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.

674
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,300
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker from Kansas.

675
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,500
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.

676
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,500
You didn't think yours were the only
coloreds around, did you, Colonel?

677
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,900
I did actually.

678
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,100
Well, I'm sure they'll do just fine.
Have they seen any mischief?

679
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,500
No, sir.

680
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,400
I'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.

681
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,900
We'll be foraging for supplies.
I could use a hand.

682
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,100
That is, it you think
your men are up to it.

683
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,700
- They are indeed, sir.
- Good. Very good.

684
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,200
- A pleasure.
- Good night.

685
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,600
Beg to report, Colonel, sir.

686
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,900
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.

687
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,000
Very good, Corporal.
Pass the word along to "A" Company.

688
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,200
We'll be going into action
in the morning.

689
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,900
Very good, sir.

690
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,700
Your men march handsomely, Colonel.
My compliments.

691
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,100
Thank you, sir.

692
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,300
I am surprised at how well
you handle them.

693
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
See, I am from Kentucky originally.

694
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,300
We owned a few ourselves,
so it comes naturally to me.

695
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:46,100
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.

696
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,100
It is impossible
to imagine Boston with slaves.

697
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,100
Company, halt!

698
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,700
- Halt!
- Shoulder arms!

699
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,200
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.

700
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,000
Well, all right!
You hear that, boys?

701
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Let's clear her out!

702
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,000
What are you doing?

703
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,600
Liberating this town
in the name of the Republic.

704
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,300
The musket, Massa Colonel?
Never shoot it. Shoot now?

705
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,400
Yeah, I don't see why not.
Go ahead.

706
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,100
Shoot the lady, boys!

707
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,000
Don't shoot!
We ain't Secess' here!

708
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,500
That man is a civilian.

709
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,100
That man is Secess',
and Secess' is all the same, son.

710
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,700
Look around. You really think anybody's
gonna put these boys into real combat?

711
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,500
Do you?

712
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,200
They're little children, for God's sake.
They're little monkey children.

713
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,000
You just gotta know
how to control them.

714
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,000
Please, let go! Oh, God!

715
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,300
You see what I mean?
Children!

716
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,600
- Animal! Leave her alone!
- Hey, boy!

717
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,000
Take your hands oft the white lady!

718
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,400
That would not have been necessary
it that Secess' woman hadn't started it.

719
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,100
They'll never learn.

720
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,600
Secess' has got to be
swept away by the hand ot God...

721
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,100
like the Jews of old.

722
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,100
And now I'll have to burn this town.

723
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:53,000
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!

724
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,100
Tell your men to set torches
and prepare to fire the buildings.

725
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,100
I will not.

726
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,800
That is an order.

727
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,300
You will do it or face charges
for disobeying your superior officer.

728
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,100
It is an immoral order, and by articles
ot war I am not bound to obey it.

729
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,900
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...

730
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,900
after your men
are placed under my command.

731
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,700
First squad, second platoon.

732
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,600
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.

733
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,200
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!

734
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,300
Right face!

735
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,600
Forward march!

736
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,700
The colors, Sergeant Major.

737
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,600
Change the colors.

738
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,700
What you lookin' at,
biscuit eaters?

739
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,500
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?

740
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,400
You ain't nothin'!

741
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,900
<i>"Dear Father. I need your help.</i>

742
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,500
<i>Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...</i>

743
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,500
<i>that we are to be
used only for manual labor.</i>

744
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,500
<i>Morale is low.</i>

745
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,100
<i>The men 's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.</i>

746
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,700
<i>Why keep drilling if they're never given
the opportunity to prove themselves?"</i>

747
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,000
Attention!

748
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,900
<i>"I have written to Governor Andrew...</i>

749
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,400
<i>as well as to
the General Staff in Washington.</i>

750
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,000
<i>But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...</i>

751
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,200
<i>can have the desired effect.</i>

752
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,400
<i>I can think of no other course.</i>

753
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,800
<i>I am sure you both pray,
as I do...</i>

754
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,800
<i>that all this
has not been in vain."</i>

755
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,100
Look like we're goin' the wrong way.

756
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,500
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Buck up, boys!

757
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,700
Hey, buck up now! Come on!

758
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,700
Someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?

759
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,600
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?

760
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,400
Come on now. Cheer up! Hey!

761
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,300
- What'd you say, boy?
- "Boy"?

762
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,000
- Let me tell you...
- Shut up, Trip...

763
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,200
Would you get up off me, snowflake?

764
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,500
See, let me explain
something to you.

765
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,600
The way I figure, I figure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...

766
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,000
it you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...

767
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,400
and you let us head on up there
where the real fightin' is.

768
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,400
Them men dyin' up that road.

769
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:16,000
It wouldn't be nothin' but Rebs dying,
it they let the 54th in it.

770
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,500
- Listen...
- Hold it!

771
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,000
As you were, Trip! As you were!

772
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,600
You men move on.

773
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,400
Stripes on a nigger.
That's like tits on a bull.

774
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,400
You're lookin' at a higher rank,
Corporal. You'll obey and like it.

775
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,100
- Make me.
- I'll make you.

776
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,100
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Attention!

777
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.

778
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,700
- Ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, Sergeant?

779
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,700
It's just a soldiers' fight, sir.

780
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,400
- All right. You men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!

781
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,600
Move it!

782
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,100
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!

783
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:09,300
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.

784
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
Go strum a banjo, boy.

785
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,600
Come on.

786
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,900
I've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.

787
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,000
Thank you.

788
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,300
Yeah, button up that collar.

789
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,600
Suck in that gut.

790
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,700
Tuck in them big black lips.

791
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,500
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.

792
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,900
I don't have to listen to this.

793
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,100
Where you goin', boy?

794
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,900
- Let me by.
- Let you by?

795
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,200
Let you by?

796
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,600
Let me tell you something, boy.

797
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,500
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like 'em.

798
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,300
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.

799
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,100
But you ain't never
gonna be nothin' to him...

800
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,200
but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.

801
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,100
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.

802
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,700
What we gonna do about it?
Want to fight me, boy?

803
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Huh? What you gonna
do about it?

804
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,400
You want to fight me, don't you?
Don't you?

805
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,600
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!

806
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,200
Get your hands off me,
gravedigger.

807
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,600
Goddamn it. Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?

808
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,800
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers here.

809
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,100
So the white man give you
a couple of stripes...

810
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,500
next thing you know, you hollerin'
and orderin' everybody around...

811
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,100
like you the massa himself.

812
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,900
Nigger, you ain't nothin'
but the white man's dog.

813
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,800
And what are you?

814
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,600
So full of hate
you wanna fight everybody...

815
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,900
'cause you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.

816
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,400
That might not be livin',
but it sure ain't dyin'.

817
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,500
And dying's what these white boys
been doin' for goin' on three years now.

818
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,800
Dyin' by the thousands.
Dyin' for you, fool!

819
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,000
I know, 'cause I dug the graves.

820
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,200
And all the time I'm diggin',
I'm asking myself, "When?

821
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,300
When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?"

822
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,900
Time's comin' when
we're gonna have to ante up.

823
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,500
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!

824
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
You watch who you call a nigger.

825
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,700
It there's any niggers around here,
it's you.

826
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,400
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.

827
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,700
It you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.

828
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,100
You men go on back to business.

829
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,600
Ah, Shaw.

830
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,600
Sit down.

831
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,700
Well, Colonel,
what can I do for you?

832
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,300
You can give me and my regiment
a transter to combat command.

833
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,800
Couldn't do it, Colonel.

834
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,300
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.

835
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,700
May I sit?

836
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,500
Thank you. Major.

837
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
I've written a letter
to my father...

838
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,400
asking him to press Governor Andrew
and President Lincoln.

839
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,600
But I don't have to wait
for all that, do I?

840
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,600
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?

841
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,800
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?

842
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,100
Your foraging,
your depredations?

843
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:18,600
Yes, I've become quite a student
of your operations in this region.

844
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,500
Thirty-four mansions,
I think it was, pillaged and burned...

845
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,300
under Colonel Montgomery's expedition
of the Combahee.

846
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,100
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...

847
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,100
with payment to parties unknown...

848
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,600
except by you.

849
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,400
False quartermaster requisitions.
Major Forbes here has seen the copies.

850
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,200
Yes, indeed.

851
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,900
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.

852
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,800
Shall I go on?

853
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,300
Can you?

854
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,400
I can report you
to the War Department.

855
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,800
Oh, yes. I can do that.

856
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,000
Let you take your regiment
out to fight?

857
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:17,000
That's what you want, isn't it?
Show what they can do.

858
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,200
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?

859
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,900
When?

860
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,200
Just as soon as
I can write the orders.

861
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,500
Major.

862
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,300
Double-quick!

863
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,500
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!

864
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,400
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.

865
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,000
Form a firing line right here!

866
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:17,700
Front rank, kneel!

867
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,900
Steady, boys!

868
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,800
Firing by battalion!

869
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,600
Aim!

870
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,800
Charge!

871
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,600
Fire!

872
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:47,900
Cease fire! Recover!

873
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,700
Here they come!

874
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,900
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!

875
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,500
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!

876
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,700
- Ready!
- Ready!

877
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,100
- Aim!
- Aim!

878
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,300
Get ready. Get ready!

879
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,400
Fire!

880
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,300
- Reload!
- Reload!

881
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,300
Quickly!

882
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,200
- Fire at will!
- Fire at will!

883
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,400
Pour it in!

884
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,500
Charge!

885
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,100
Look out, boy! Look out!

886
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,500
Fire!

887
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,600
They're turnin' tail!

888
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,200
Run, you Rebs!

889
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,400
Deploy skirmishers, Captain.

890
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,800
Re-form your ranks!
Re-form your ranks!

891
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,800
Fall in! On the double!

892
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:49,100
- Form Company.
- Thomas!

893
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,100
How do, Colonel?

894
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,000
Hurts, doesn't it?

895
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,600
Well, I'm extremely jealous.

896
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,000
You'll be back in Boston before me,
sitting by the fire...

897
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,200
reading Hawthorne,
cup of decent coffee.

898
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,900
I'm not going back.

899
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:19,000
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.

900
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,700
Robert, promise me...

901
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,600
that you won't send me back.

902
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,700
Promise me!

903
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,900
All right. All right.

904
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,600
Colonel Shaw!

905
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,900
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?

906
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,300
Lee was turned back in Pennsylvania
at Gettysburg...

907
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,400
now Grant's taken Vicksburg,
and all on the Fourth of July.

908
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,300
- My God!
- Yeah!

909
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,000
It looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.

910
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,600
- So, how did they do?
- Splendid. Just splendid.

911
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,100
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.

912
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,200
Give me the details.
I'll wire it in.

913
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,300
I don't think we got
a prayer of making the paper.

914
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,400
I'll talk to you later
in your tent.

915
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,100
As you were.

916
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,700
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

917
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:01,300
You fought very well
yesterday, Trip.

918
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:05,800
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.

919
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,600
Yes, sir?

920
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,600
Yes, and I think you should bear
the regimental colors.

921
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,800
Well...

922
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,500
It's considered quite an honor.

923
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,500
Why not?

924
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
Well, I'm...

925
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,600
wantin' to say somethin', sir,
but I...

926
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,700
Go ahead.

927
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,500
All right. See...

928
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,500
I ain't fightin' this war
for you, sir.

929
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,500
I see.

930
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,000
I mean, what's the point?

931
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,100
Ain't nobody gonna win.
It's just gonna go on and on.

932
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,900
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.

933
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,800
Somebody's gonna win.

934
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,100
Who?

935
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,900
I mean, you get to go on back
to Boston to a big house and all that.

936
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,200
What about us?
What do we get?

937
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,400
Well, you won't get anything
if we lose.

938
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,200
What do you want to do?

939
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,400
I don't know, sir.

940
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,000
It stinks, I suppose.

941
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,900
Yeah, it stinks bad.

942
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,500
And we all covered up in it.
Ain't nobody clean.

943
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,100
Be nice to get clean though.

944
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,100
How do we do that?

945
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,700
We ante up and kick in, sir.

946
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,300
But I still don't
wanna carry your flag.

947
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
No one will ever take Charleston
without first...

948
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,900
silencing the forts
which protect its harbor.

949
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:32,100
And the first one that must
be taken is that, Fort Wagner.

950
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,000
Wagner mounts a ten-inch Columbiad...

951
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:39,600
three smoothbore 32-pounders...

952
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,900
a 42-pound Carronade...

953
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:46,900
a 10-inch Coast Mortar
and four 12-pound Howitzers...

954
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,300
plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.

955
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,700
As many of you gentlemen
may be aware...

956
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,900
for the last four days
our navy has weakened Wagner...

957
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,900
with a constant barrage.

958
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:01,300
Headquarters has determined a time
for our attack.

959
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:06,900
We will proceed with a direct
frontal assault tomorrow at dusk.

960
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,200
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.

961
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,800
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip of sand...

962
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:17,000
a natural defile, through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.

963
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,400
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...

964
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,700
long enough for reinforcements
to exploit the breach.

965
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:29,300
Needless to say, casualties
in the leading regiment may be extreme.

966
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,900
General Strong.

967
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,800
The 54th Massachusetts...

968
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,800
requests the honor of leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.

969
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,800
It's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?

970
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,800
Yes, sir.

971
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,100
You and your men
haven't slept for two days.

972
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,100
That's right, sir.

973
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,800
And you think they have the strength
to lead this charge?

974
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,100
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.

975
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,100
There's character.

976
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,100
There's strength of heart.

977
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,800
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.

978
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,900
We were a sight to see.

979
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,700
We'll be ready, sir.

980
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,900
When do you want us?

981
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:54,800
O Lord, O Lord

982
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,100
Lord, Lord, Lord

983
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,300
He packed in the animals
two by two

984
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,900
An ox, a camel and a kangaroo

985
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,500
Packed them in that ark so tight

986
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,600
I couldn't get no sleep that night

987
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,900
Grown-up sons
Shem and Ham

988
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,100
Tell me about God's master plan

989
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:24,000
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

990
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,400
- Tomorrow we goin' to battle.
- All right.

991
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:52,100
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the rifle in one hand...

992
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and the Good Book in the other.

993
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,600
- Yeah!
- Amen!

994
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:03,000
That if I should die
at the muzzle of the rifle...

995
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:07,800
die on water or on land...

996
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:13,000
I may know that You,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.

997
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,600
With Jesus!

998
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,800
And I have no fear. Amen.

999
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:26,300
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

1000
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,900
Lord, we stand before You
this evenin'...

1001
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,300
to say thank you.

1002
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,900
We thank You, Father,
for Your grace...

1003
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,300
and Your many blessings.

1004
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,700
Now, I run off...

1005
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,400
and left all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.

1006
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,500
So I'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father...

1007
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:06,300
to ask Your blessings
on all of us...

1008
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:11,000
so that if tomorrow
is our great getting-up mornin'...

1009
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,800
if tomorrow we have to meet
the Judgment Day...

1010
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,300
O Heavenly Father,
we want You to let our folks know...

1011
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,200
that we died facin' the enemy.

1012
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,500
We want 'em to know
that we went down standin' up...

1013
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,100
Yes, Lord!

1014
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,500
Among those that are fightin'
against our oppression!

1015
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:33,200
We want 'em to know, Heavenly Father,
that we died for freedom.

1016
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,100
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen!

1017
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,400
- Trip! Come on!
- No, I ain't...

1018
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,400
You better get
your butt up there, boy.

1019
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:01,100
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.

1020
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,700
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.

1021
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,600
Go on. Let it out.

1022
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:14,000
I ain't much
about no prayin' now.

1023
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,900
I ain't never had no family and...

1024
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,100
killed off my mama.

1025
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,300
This feels funny.

1026
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,300
- Come on.
- It's all right.

1027
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,100
Come on now.
You're doin' fine.

1028
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,500
Well, I just...

1029
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,400
You know, y'all's... y'all's...

1030
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,400
Y'all's the onliest family I got.

1031
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:01,200
Well, that's all right.

1032
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,600
And, uh...

1033
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:11,200
- I love the 54th.
- All right.

1034
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,300
Ain't much matter what happens tomorrow,
'cause we men, ain't we?

1035
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,100
- Yes, sir!
- Amen!

1036
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,700
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!

1037
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,200
Shit.

1038
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,600
All right.

1039
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:44,100
- Attention, company!

- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.

1046
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,200
I wonder if you might
do something for me.

1047
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:59,400
I have some letters here.
Personal things.

1048
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,000
Certainly, Colonel.

1049
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,400
Also, if I should fall...

1050
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,400

1051
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:15,400

1055

01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,700

1059
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,400

and carry on?

1060
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,200
I will.

1061
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,300
Huzzah!

1062
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,700

Take cover in the dunes!

1081
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,400
Take cover!

1082
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,400
Company commanders, we'll wait here
and advance under cover of darkness.
