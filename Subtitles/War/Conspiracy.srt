Joanna?

879

He's Carly's--?

880
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:58,330
No, no, he's not.

881
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:00,566
No. No.

882

You grow up in a town like Lago
and you marry the first guy--

883
01:00:06,506 --> 01:00:10,609
And he was no winner, either.

884
01:00:12,078 --> 01:00:14,446
He died when Carly was 2.

885
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:17,216
He drove head-on into a, uh, bar

886
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:18,617

a week's salary in.

887
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:22,021
And Rhodes?

888
01:00:24,657 --> 01:00:27,126
After Jerry died,

889
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,695
the only thing I had left
was unpaid bills.

890
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:32,698
The only family
I had in the world

891
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:33,999
was Carly and my brother,

892
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,268
Donnie, and he couldn't
hold on to a job

893
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:38,771
if it had a handle on it.

894
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:42,007
And then Rhodes came to town,

895
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:44,910
and he was rich,

896
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:47,746
and kind,

897
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:49,948
and smart,

898
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:53,285
and he courted me for months.

899
01:00:55,655 --> 01:00:56,689
After we started...

900
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:02,594
seeing each other,
he set me up in my own store,

901
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:06,231
and he was--
He was good to Carly and me.

902
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:08,033
He was so gentle.

903
01:01:10,537 --> 01:01:12,971
And then he decided
to make Lago his home,

904
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:16,575
and no one could believe
that a man like that

905
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:18,310
would want to stay here.

906
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:20,546
And he started to throw money
into everything,

907
01:01:20,547 --> 01:01:23,482
and he started
to rebuild the town.

908
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:26,685
And everyone felt safe.

909
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:29,955
Hell, I felt safe
for the first time in my life.

912

without him knowing about it.

who John Rhodes really was,

914
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:48,240
he had owned us,

915
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:50,409
and in a blink, there were
no more business owners,

916
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,478
there were just employees.

917
01:01:52,479 --> 01:01:54,013

918
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,047

that I can run

Yeah, they're just cheap slaves
