1
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:04,100
You have not heard? The Lord is the God that lasts forever, creator of the earth

2
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,300
He will not fail to be.

3
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,780
His understanding is not of men, that it is not.

4
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,560
In strengthens the powerful, and increases the power of the weak.

5
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,620
Even the use of force weak, men fall

6
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,120
But those who hope in the Lord

7
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Su fuerza renewed.

8
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,940
Expand their eagles like eagles, run and not faint.

9
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,720
They will walk and not be afraid.

10
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,770
Hold.

11
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,050
Hold on, let's get you out of here.

12
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,820
16 before

13
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,730
Desmond

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,730
Desmond

15
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,840
What?

16
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
Wait

17
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Pass me.

18
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Wait, I have something to tell you.

19
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
What thing Al?

20
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,770
A race to the top.

21
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,770
Hey cheater.

22
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,650
See you later.

23
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,940
- Hey

24
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
A hand?

25
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
I have it

26
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,850
Go stones.

27
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,250
- No, leave it.

28
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,020
What are they saying?

29
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,800
Children, steer clear of the cliff, dumb kids, do not play there.

30
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,300
Sanders are children, crazy like his father.

31
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,640
They dug the corner on Main Street

32
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,500
They put a sidewalk.

33
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,220
No longer recognize now.

34
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,400
And to you I no longer recognize you.

35
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,480
With my work I recognize when I go walking

36
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,220
It is as if he had died with you.

37
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,250
As if we had never existed

38
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,650
Well that's all I have for you today

39
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,960
Block it with your right Desmond

40
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,440
Alto me, you hear?

41
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,740
Because they are fighting?

42
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,380
- Since when they need a reason?

43
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Tom here ...

44
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,730
Very good enough, and they saw and possibly going to hit whoever wins

45
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,410
Tom.

46
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,930
No!

47
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,930
God!

48
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,970
Tom! Wake up, you hear me?

49
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,240
What the hell have you done?

50
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,640
- You can not hear me.

51
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,100
I'll get some ice.

52
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,060
Remove the basket.

53
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,060
I got it.

54
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,340
Al, Al you hear me?

55
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,680
When you hear me?

56
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,450
Al?

57
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,330
Our father, heaven, earth.

58
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,940
What did you do?

59
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,420
I'll hit you now know

60
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,970
I heard son?

61
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,960
- Sixth Commandment, Thou shalt not kill.

62
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,900
Desmond!

63
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,250
- Tom just please, a second peace for the child.

64
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,250
He has had enough.

65
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,640
Very well fill it with kisses, tell him that the world is a soft and gentle place.

66
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,920
When it will be fine.

67
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,300
I could have killed him.

68
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,660
- If you could.

69
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,730
The killing is the worst of all

70
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,700
Taking the life of another person is most degrading in the world

71
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,380
Nothing hurts more than his heart.

72
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,000
What the hell's going on.

73
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,730
You do not walk unless I say walk.

74
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,730
What the fuck is what happens!

75
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,860
- Mind your own business

76
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,540
I hate it.

77
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,320
Mom.

78
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,460
Because he hates us so much?

79
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,020
No, he does not hate us.

80
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,780
He hates himself, sometimes

81
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,740
Your father did not used to be like

82
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,580
I wish they had known as before the war.

83
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,010
15 years later

84
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,820
Desmond we sound like?

85
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Like a celestial choir of angels mom

86
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,760
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie especially in this place

87
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Well I never said that angels sang

88
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,860
What's going on out, Desmond?

89
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,610
Get him.

90
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,250
-And.

91
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,440
We'll call an ambulance.

92
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,370
- There is no time

93
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,010
Joshua, wake up, fast.

94
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,210
You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

95
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,180
What do we have?

96
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,810
It seems an artery can have scissors? - Yes doctor.

97
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,810
Put some pressure on, you put this tourniquet?

98
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,040
- Yes doctor.

99
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,320
Good job, you may have saved the life of this boy.

100
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,660
Stay with us, you'll be fine.

101
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,180
Yes, stay with me, you'll be fine

102
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,660
Medical examination is there, here's to donate blood.

103
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,540
You're good?

104
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,810
Oh no, it's not mine, I'm fine, thanks for asking Miss.

105
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,580
What do you need?

106
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,980
- My belt.

107
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,160
I put it to the boy the accident, my pants are not well without it.

108
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,410
Well, I have not your belt. - Yes, I know Miss is there in the boy.

109
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,530
Ok, I'm here to take blood.

110
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,330
- I'll give you mine.

111
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,720
Ok.

112
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,610
See that room with us, I'll call.

113
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,740
That, that room.

114
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,250
He had already sounded before blood sir?

115
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
- Dawson

116
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,140
My friends call me Dawson but never in the first time.

117
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,360
I always wanted to be a doctor but

118
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,480
I did not have much school.

119
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,540
I'm like my father.

120
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,890
Someone will pick you up?

121
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,930
- No miss, walk back.

122
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,930
Where do you live?

123
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,930
- Four Miss Hill.

124
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,610
It's far.

125
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,330
- Five to six miles, but short in the woods.

126
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,330
Seven out there.

127
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,540
Must much to like the forest.

128
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
- Yeah right.

129
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,480
Ok, put pressure there.

130
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,060
You're good?

131
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,060
- Yes.

132
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,680
Where will you also dressed and handsome?

133
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
- I met someone yesterday

134
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,440
A woman named Dorothy in the hospital, I'll marry her.

135
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
God Does she know?

136
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
- Not yet but by learning.

137
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Have you ever talked to a woman?

138
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
One that is not family?

139
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Tell her.

140
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,980
- Well then, come and give your brother a big hug.

141
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Take your dirty hands on me.

142
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,490
Wish me luck mom.

143
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,490
- Good luck.

144
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,650
Next, take a seat.

145
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,170
It has already donated blood before? - Yes Miss I've already done

146
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,610
You're the boy's belt.

147
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,250
- Desmond, if Miss.

148
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,250
Desmond Well, we can not take your blood two days.

149
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,250
That's fine because I want mine back

150
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,960
What about you? - My blood, I need it back.

151
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,080
Well not work that way, we can not only regresártela.

152
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,610
Well you have to, since you sting me with that needle my heart beats very fast.

153
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,900
Every time I think of you beats even faster

154
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,560
I had never heard that before, it's very corny.

155
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
- It is.

156
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,660
But how shy I am, I practiced all night.

157
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
It was not good?

158
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,320
- I did not say that.

159
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,690
What is the difference between an artery and a vein?

160
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,370
What are you talking about?

161
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,370
- The boy from the accident.

162
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,260
Spit blood arteries.

163
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,580
And veins?

164
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
bleed

165
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,960
I think you should practice your conversation boy and girl before coming

166
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Probably yes.

167
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll give you a book if you are interested.

168
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,170
About dating?

169
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,140
On blood.

170
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,570
Another medical question perhaps?

171
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,170
No, I was just thinking that you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen

172
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,370
It must be because you see me in the dark

173
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,300
No, just're beautiful

174
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,660
You need to see where we go.

175
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,980
Sorry, I did not think you care.

176
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
No wonder.

177
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,120
I thought you might like.

178
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
It could be if you had requested.

179
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,660
Viennese?

180
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,060
Why did not you tell us anything?

181
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,090
- Because I know they had said no, and I know that what I do is good

182
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,090
And what about your command?

183
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,090
Not kill in a war.

184
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,170
It protects many guys who leave the church.

185
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,810
There is a war, and need men, working in the newspaper did not save this country.

186
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,010
It looks like a movie star

187
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,010
My boy.

188
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,000
Nice uniform, good hand.

189
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,040
It reminds me of when is the uniform and went to France

190
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,720
You remember?

191
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
- Do not talk about - what?

192
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm just saying how good I looked in that uniform

193
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,690
You guys all seemed to think that.

194
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,920
Your mother I flirted with him

195
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,000
Not so good when you have a hole in the front of your jacket

196
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,060
A trigger input, on white.

197
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,000
Arty was wounded in the back, with all its organs and intestines outside front

198
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Unpleasant everywhere

199
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,060
She clung to his uniform for a moment

200
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:28,500
He was lucky to be dead not to have seen his bloody uniform

201
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,680
Get out of my sight.

202
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,650
What are you? Part mountain goat?

203
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,300
You're going to help Desmond? Or will you leave me stranded?

204
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,860
I'll help you but it will cost you.

205
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
- What.

206
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
A kiss.

207
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,010
That is pure blackmail.

208
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,250
- If Miss so, but still it will be.

209
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:06,210
Last step, I will hold you too.

210
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,850
Wait.

211
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,930
You're not going to slap me right? Why I'll fall and take you with me

212
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,930
Kiss me and find out

213
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,660
What?

214
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,080
I must enlist

215
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,010
I can not stay here while they're all going to fight for me.

216
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,920
If you can.

217
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
- I do not have to.

218
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,820
I'll be a doctor, I'll see how to save people not to kill

219
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,740
I have to go to work be late

220
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,210
Dorothy, Dorothy.

221
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,900
So you're going to ask me to marry you or what?

222
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,260
Well I still do not know'd want?

223
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Well, I would not know unless you ask.

224
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,760
Well I'm asking you.

225
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,640
With all my heart, will you marry me?

226
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,700
So yes, yes I will.

227
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,210
When?

228
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,210
- When you have your first permit

229
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,810
But I'm still mad at you right now

230
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,810
- Yes, OK.

231
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,380
OK te amo.

232
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,700
Mom said you came to see here. - Yes.

233
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,100
These three were my best friends.

234
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,740
I grew up with them.

235
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,840
I got into trouble with them I chased girls with them.

236
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,720
I enlisted with them.

237
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,760
Half of them is there

238
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,980
covered in dirt and grass eaten by worms

239
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,600
I do not want to have to visit my children here.

240
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,860
Dad, me and enlistment in the army

241
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,850
I could not have done differently dad way.

242
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,720
All else is doing.

243
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
- Leave all other

244
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:35,000
Everyone else someone like ... The imbeciles who went us

245
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,890
You know, the soldiers will leave because they can do that, you can not.

246
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,690
You have to sit and pray and do it all

247
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,580
I mean look at you you're doing right now

248
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,130
You may not be able to live with yourself if you go

249
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,130
No, I can not myself if I do not.

250
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,080
I'll be a doctor, that will be my way of service.

251
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,720
And there you are solving everything, but believe that this war will resolve you?

252
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Your ideas?

253
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,880
Well, I know it will be difficult

254
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,140
It will not be difficult, will be impossible.

255
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,060
You know, whatever you have put on the head will never get out of there does not work well

256
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,600
And if somehow survive do not know lucky you will not be giving thanks to God.

257
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,530
Come on boys in the legs, say goodbye to mom.

258
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,280
I almost forgot, take, it's mine.

259
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,730
Keep it right here where I am.

260
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,210
I love you.

261
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,120
Hey.

262
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,760
-I'm sorry friend.

263
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,100
Where are your keys

264
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,100
You want to look under my bed?

265
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,770
Look who's lost

266
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:09,280
Sit here, good elecion the mountains and lake.

267
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I'm Fuller

268
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
- Desmond Dawson

269
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,380
Tell a teacher, Naddie understand what it says

270
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,380
- That's because no one here can read.

271
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,000
Those testicles belong to a man who calls himself Holliwood

272
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,020
It would seem that belong to a smaller type

273
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,060
Hey, I just got these shoes

274
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,040
I'm Nolan, where are you? - Virginia.

275
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,090
Well you married your cousin?

276
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,090
Catch you.

277
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,290
That's Smithy there, brings the gun in his back.

278
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,290
As well you're doing better knucklehead

279
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,780
Hey, I'm not trying to embarrass you.

280
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,490
Smithy Kasinsky, cost to meet you.

281
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,900

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,860
As you said your name was? - Desmond Dawson

283
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,140
That's Tex Louis there, he thinks he's a cowboy type.

284
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,730
And Vito Vanelly may be small but it is a bulldog.

285
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,650
Hey

286
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,650

287
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,290
This guy here is Lucky Ford - Hey.

288
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,810
That's Walkey and Penny out there who are good at faking letters

289
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,100
Hey bájale your fat ok?

290
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
- Unless you want to put it right in your mouth.

291
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,940
Hey, you've got a good book it?

292
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,940
I think Lucky is a good book is also true Lucky?

293
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
It's good reading.

294
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,770
Attention!

295
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,330
Come on, get moving, let's get moving.

296
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,440
You are a very rare individual if you do not mind me saying so out name?

297
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,010
Andy Walker.

298
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,010
How long have you been dead son?

299
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,680
Mr?

300
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,420
- I'm not sir!

301
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Soy Srjento Hall o search.

302
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,920
Lord tells useless people.

303
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,620
Your name is Karl said?

304
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
- Walker, Sergeant.

305
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,580
- Well there is.

306
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,580
- If Sgt.

307
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,520
There is something wrong with your presentation out.

308
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,560
You can not identify, perhaps it is your hair?

309
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,300
It is the wart between his underwear?

310
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,410
I have a knife in my sergeant foot.

311
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,880
So of course, that is, the knife.

312
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,090
What's your name soldier.

313
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,280
Speedy Right

314
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,410
- Not your name is out idiot.

315
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,700
You know why?

316
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,180
- Because I have a knife in the foot.

317
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:08,820
Who put the knife out there?

318
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,400
- It was an accident Sergeant were playing well.

319
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,890
As I not put it there on purpose, who put the knife?

320
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,410
I did Sergeant, Corporal Krasinski

321
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,060
You are part Indian, what tribe you belong son?

322
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,560
I am Polish.

323
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,420
- I think it must have Cherokee blood in you or Molowny

324
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,060
-No sir.

325
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,040
You're contradicting?

326
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Your average ilk son of a bitch

327
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,980
- Sgt not.

328
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Let me see your war cry of Indian child.

329
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,210
-I do not...

330
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,250
What's your spirit animal?

331
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,380
You're a snake in the clouds - No Sgt.

332
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,170
You are a sheep duck? - No sergeant

333
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,850
You're a rhino dancing?

334
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,810
- No Sargento

335
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,580
You're contradicting out?

336
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,370
- No Sgt. - What?

337
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,800
From now on I will call boss, as a sign of great respect for your people

338
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,280
- Thank you Sgt.

339
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,250
These mocking or so are my son.

340
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,130
- I am sorry.

341
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,860
Name out?

342
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,600
- Desmond Dawson

343
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,180
I have seen corncobs with better appearance

344
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
They make me want to take off an ear out.

345
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,070
You can upload your own weight?

346
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,080
- If Sgt.

347
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
It must be easy for you then.

348
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Soldier

349
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,500
- Be sure to put away this man of strong winds

350
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,880
If Sgt.

351
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,450
jerk out

352
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,040
- Yes sir.

353
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,570
Lift your foot

354
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,570
- Higher.

355
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,570
Everybody out, now.

356
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,000
Muévanse.

357
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,980
I said get moving.

358
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,660
I'm just putting my uniform sir.

359
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,090
- Perhaps I asked him soldier?

360
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,020
- I do not remember Sgt.

361
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,690
I think any man who takes pride in its natural state

362
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,500
Surely you enjoy the breeze outside.

363
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,170
Now move your parts, parts out.

364
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,170
Move on.

365
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,900
Shew an act of competition

366
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,020
I could teach them to tie a height

367
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,880
But they could save their asses up.

368
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
So I decide to keep

369
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,000
Cape Loup, this is the rabbit hole

370
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,260
The rabbit hole goes.

371
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,730
Climb up the tree behind him.

372
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,180
Very good,

373
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Come on

374
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,340
Well Tex, do not hard to master.

375
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,490
Have you ever tied one Holliwood goat?

376
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,380
- No Sgt.

377
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,380
Have you ever seen the size of a goat?

378
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Well, it would have been unnatural.

379
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,720
If you do not breathe you die.

380
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,160
Congratulations genius, just 50 feet fall and you've broken your neck.

381
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,260
Brilliant, cabo Vito Binelli

382
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,260
You fool yourself strangled

383
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,920
You are a fan of De Niro,

384
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,140
- No sergeant.

385
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,170
If you were American higher would be.

386
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,420
I hope we have here, one for each boob?

387
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,880
Stop doing Nuos, and begins to make brassiere

388
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,370
That's so funny soldier?

389
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,370
'I could not know sergeant

390
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:18,880
Come on, we progress forward Misses

391
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,330
I want to see some fire here, show me some hostility.

392
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,160
Now down down we are going to leave to him.

393
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,660
Come on, move down, let me see we

394
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:35,530
I never said in twos effort going forward effort.

395
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,490
Let they're waiting, let's move your ass.

396
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,490
We will not surrender, we will try try.

397
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,560
Hey, you're okay.?

398
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,920
- If I am fine

399
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,300
What's wrong with them? Someone took his energy we get moving

400
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Move your back to finish line

401
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Hard, hard, move your back towards the end.

402
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,810
This is a personal gift from the government of the United States for each of you

403
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,330
Standard Rifle United States Army

404
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:39,260
30 caliber, semiautomatic shoulder weapon designed to

405
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,440
Bring death and destruction to the enemy.

406
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,490
This will be her lover, her Miss, his concubine.

407
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,040
Perhaps the only thing in your life that really come to love

408
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,450
Misses let's dance, take a lady.

409
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,760
He has not put his soul in front, I do not want to get shot today.

410
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,500
No matter how much you are tempted, put his gun next

411
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,080
Bring attention.

412
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,410
Problem out of corn.

413
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:21,450
Was there no one of his size, or color is the problem?

414
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,450
No Sgt.

415
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,960
If you told me not had to carry a weapon.

416
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,160
Come out people let me get this straight.

417
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,240
Sorry Sgt.

418
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,530
I can not touch a gun.

419
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,600
What exactly is the problem?

420
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
- No problem just a mistake.

421
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,240
I told them that I said that when he entered ...

422
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,640
- This is impossible

423
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Because it is impossible to know out?

424
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,570
- No sir. For the United States Army does not make mistakes.

425
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,120
There is a problem, you must be the problem.

426
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,500
I just should not have been sent to the company's weapons.

427
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,080
It is a seal sir.

428
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,770
You have an objective awareness, and you join the army?

429
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,770
Well no, no sir ...

430
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,850
My conscience is cooperative

431
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,620
You're kidding me Dawson?

432
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
- No sir I volunteer

433
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,000
I have no problem with using unorme and the flag and do my homework.

434
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,200
That's what I can not carry a gun, or take someone's life.

435
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
You do not kill, that is?

436
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
- Yes sir, that's

437
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I can not kill in war.

438
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,810
That is this is nature at war

439
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,160
Yes sir.

440
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,640
It's okay.

441
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,170
You have any other request of the United States Army?

442
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,080
Is there anything else we can do to make you feel comfortable with us?

443
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,090
He does not want, work on Saturdays sir.

444
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,640
I believe in the sacredness of the seventh day, and Saturday is my holy day.

445
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
It allows me to work that day

446
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,960
I do not think that means a problem, if you sergeant?

447
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,050
Simplementedebemos ask the enemy who does not encroach on the Sabbath

448
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,050
Because the place needs a prayer.

449
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,980
Okay, now we leave that clear

450
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,410
Now let me tell my requests.

451
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,490
They are not as complicated as you are very simple

452
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:33,290
While in our company, under my command, you acatarás my orders, period.

453
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,300
If I can not trust you here, I could not make it out.

454
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,360
I will put you in the first section eight, you can desecharte.

455
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,090
Piérdanse.

456
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,090
Gentlemen.

457
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,090
I want to know after Desmond Dawson

458
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,460
Cape does not believe in violence.

459
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,520
The practice no violence, not even like to touch a gun.

460
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,600
See Cape is a conscious objective

461
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,050
So I ask you, do not look for him to save them on the battlefield.

462
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,960
Because undoubtedly he will be busy fighting with his conscience

463
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,330
To help.

464
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,330
- Sergeant that's not true, Sergeant

465
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,330
You'd be!

466
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,800
I realize that some of you might have strong feelings about this

467
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,450
That's what we're fighting

468
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,180
Nuestrosderechos defend and protect

469
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,180
Our women and children.

470
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,500
Although the beliefs of the oacionar could die

471
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,700
So I hope that everyone in this company.

472
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,410
After Dawson give the respect it deserves

473
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,060
For the short time he will be with us.

474
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
I was clear?

475
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
- If Sgt.

476
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,940
Dawsy you got there?

477
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,300
Do you know what that is?

478
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,300
- It seems a little small.

479
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Half of the Bible for half a man.

480
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,300
Let SPICKY regrésale your Bible.

481
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
- I am not talking to you.

482
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,480
So you do not fight, you think you can be better than this?

483
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
- No.

484
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,640
If you were attacked?

485
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,460
Did you like that?

486
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,880
It says that you must put your other cheek is not it?

487
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,360
You see I do not think this is a matter of religion friends.

488
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,020
I think it's a matter of cowardice.

489
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,540
Simple and easy, is not Dawson?

490
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,260
You're a chicken is not it?

491
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,360
Come on, do something.

492
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,170
You see, I will give a free blow right there we go

493
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,640
Hit me, let Dawson

494
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
No?

495
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,660
What is this?

496
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,460
- Give me that!

497
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,460
It's quite a package.

498
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,980
Now this is the kind of package that deserves a real man.

499
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,820
Give me that Smithy

500
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,320
-Please

501
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,250
Please.

502
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,360
Please give it back Smithy

503
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,770
Please give it back Smithy

504
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,580
Hearing voices Dawson?

505
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,840
No sir

506
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,090
From what I understand have communication with God, is it?

507
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,090
Lord I'm not a crazy person

508
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,850
This is how you think it takes people like crazy?

509
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:18,850
I know I'm different, but not pretend to be someone I'm not, I am what I am.

510
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,930
It sounds lonely.

511
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,930
You are alone?

512
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,180
So do not hear voices?

513
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,520
- No sir, I pray to God

514
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,640
And I like to think he hears me, but it is not a conversation.

515
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,340
Since we're pretending to have at this time.

516
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,740
Faking out?

517
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,940
- Yes sir, I know you put me in section eight

518
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,890
For me out of the army but no, I will not

519
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,650
I just believe in what I believe.

520
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:58,450
Well, I'm trying to understand, it was God who told you you will not take a rifle?

521
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,320
God says thou shalt not kill.

522
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,490
That is one of the most important commandments

523
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,980
Most people take it, You shall not commit murder.

524
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,040
war are totally different circumstances

525
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:14,010
And Jesus said, and give you a new commandment

526
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,200
They love each other just as I love

527
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,980
It is the real demon with whom we are fighting, sure as a good Christian can see that.

528
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,960
I can see that, sir, that's why I joined.

529
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,220
But sorry, I'll carry no weapons.

530
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:38,610
Their religious beliefs are unique, but they do not entitled to dismissal

531
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,130
As is supposed to maintain discipline with a man in my community?

532
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:46,810
I do not know, but he is a conscious object capable of

533
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,020
Play a role as a combat medic

534
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
If you qualify in other areas where train.

535
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,040
Maybe we can do to stop this idea.

536
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,380
Well restríngelo the barrel and KP, if God throws you

537
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,120
You will throw him hell.

538
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,120
I want him out of here.

539
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,740
Dawson tubaria is a disgrace, it is a pig pen.

540
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,090
That was funny out?

541
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,420
- No sir Did you shit on your head?

542
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,420
- No sergeant

543
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,890
What they can not recognize, it is that the unit is as weak as its weakest member.

544
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,810
And if they do not learn this election, there will be this weekend passes.

545
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,260
All will be in KP

546
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,500
Now everyone ready for climbing 20 miles, come on!

547
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Come on!

548
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,130
Put your feet well, you do not start feeling sorry for yourself

549
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,010
It sickens me to feel sorry for themselves

550
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:07,120
Still do not know what it means to be tired, we go forward until dusk.

551
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,360
Hey, just, I'm trying to sleep.

552
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,890
Get behind me, out.

553
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,650
Why the hell are you still here?

554
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Above!

555
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,400
Where is Dawson?

556
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,380
This is not good for anyone.

557
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,380
- It sure is not what I joined

558
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,050
It is not because you joined.

559
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,930
It is the lives of each of the men here.

560
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,120
And your son, it's time to give up on this.

561
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,890
Ends, and you debístete and shut up.

562
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,930
Okay, Dawson no shame in this.

563
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
Let's move on.

564
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:14,080
In fact I have my duties, I am now KP so ...

565
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,800
I can not.

566
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,940
Okay Dawson

567
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,560
Cape Dawson

568
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,620
You can identify the men who beat you?

569
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,370
No Sgt.

570
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,700
He is saying that you can not recognize those who beat you?

571
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,960
I never said I was attacked Sgt.

572
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,560
But what the fuck are you saying Dawson?

573
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,560
You've left bruises while you slept?

574
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,340
I, I sleep very hard.

575
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,530
Very good.

576
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:05,210
And when they leave this weekend I want to put a hat.

577
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,100
I do not want to return well the cream.

578
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
A little cream for Sgt.

579
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,100
I have a show right now Smithy

580
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,660
He's on sangento experience?

581
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,810
You should ask your mom about that child.

582
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
Following.

583
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,540
Rest.

584
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,650
Cape Dawson

585
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,880
I'm afraid I can not authorize exit pass.

586
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,780
This is full of not completed training.

587
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,690
No sir, respectfully sir I did.

588
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,040
Expected this three weeks ago, I'm going to marry.

589
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,490
This afternoon.

590
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,170
It says here that you're not qualified for the rifle.

591
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,130
Well it not required to carry a rifle me Colonel ...

592
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:01,260
The colonel said it should be allowed to work as a doctor.

593
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:05,850
Whenever approved in all other areas of your workout

594
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,100
And he has not qualified in testing the rifle out.

595
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,140
Quite clear.

596
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,440
Show me you know how to handle a rifle.

597
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,480
And sign your departure.

598
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,160
Soldier Cannon.

599
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,080
- Mr.

600
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,600
Give the soldier his gun.

601
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,800
Do not touch that rifle sir.

602
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
I'm not asking you out.

603
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,620
That's an order from your commander.

604
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,530
Dawson holy God let this nonsense, and resignation.

605
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,820
He refuses to do so and have no choice

606
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,820
To ask for court martial.

607
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:56,060
And you spend the rest of the war in a military prison.

608
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,500
I can not sir.

609
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,210
The more you want to wait dear?

610
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,330
I think it has already been enough.

611
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,610
Sorry, sometimes men have cold feet

612
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,000
Some men could, but not my Desmond.

613
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,490
You probably think I'm a bastard

614
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,850
Who cares more rules than their men.

615
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,010
May l?

616
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,210
I believe in this book as much as any other man.

617
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,570
But like any other man fights with my conscience but.

618
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:29,770
What do you do when everything you value is under attack?

619
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,980
I do not know sir.

620
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,240
I can not answer these questions.

621
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,160
But I also feel that my values ​​are under attack.

622
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,160
I do not know why.

623
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,680
I do not care about your principles that the Japanese not

624
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,820
When you see a wounded soldier or attack you?

625
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,210
Hit him with your Bible?

626
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,800
I am ready to give my life for my men.

627
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,130
You do not always win just by giving your life.

628
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,730
Look, you're here because I do not want to see you in a cell.

629
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,330
Declare yourself guilty and have the mercy of the court, and you can go home to celebrate.

630
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,730
Let the brave men win this war

631
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,900
If I do not come, maybe her if

632
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,010
I was not allowed to call you.

633
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,130
I knew it was not your fault.

634
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,620
What have you.

635
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:45,210
I'm fine, it's fine just had a fight with the walls and lost.

636
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,810
They will send you to prison Desmond

637
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,760
There must be some other way.

638
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,800
I do not know what could be.

639
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,640
I have done everything I have asked me, except everything they've asked me.

640
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,640
And I'm going to court because I do not kill.

641
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,500
You tried, and nobody can say you did.

642
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,490
But you'll be safe in prison.

643
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,400
Perhaps no one - You can not take a girl and play around with it

644
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
You do not have to do it, just open your way out.

645
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,960
But I can not do that.

646
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,960
- This is pride, and foolishness.

647
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,960
Do not confuse your will with the Lord.

648
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,160
I am a proud fool.

649
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,780
Maybe I am a proud and silly.

650
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:50,100
But it will not hold me but I begin to believe what I believe.

651
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,740
Less if you could live with me.

652
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:57,770
I'll never be the man I want to do to your eyes.

653
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,090
I fell in love with you.

654
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,090
Because you're not like the others.

655
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,130
I need you to.

656
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,970
Do not think for a moment, you disappoint me

657
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,520
I will love you, no matter what.

658
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,100
I do not know what else to do.

659
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
He loses no matter what.

660
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,400
They want to plead guilty and disenroll from dishonorable.

661
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,970
Otherwise it will refuse insurance to prison

662
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,960
in any way be called a coward and can not live with that

663
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:00,850
Thanks Dorothy, if you talk to the

664
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,640
tell him we love him and we will pray for you two

665
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,810
I will, thanks bye.

666
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,410
I can help you sir?

667
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,410
I want to talk to the general.

668
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,580
No, without an appointment it would be impossible.

669
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:23,580
And if you would be kind enough to tell that Colonel Thomas Dawson wants to talk to him?

670
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,580
He is in a very important appointment.

671
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:30,920
I peel off with him in France, he was my captain.

672
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,570
Please Miss is vital.

673
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,840
You end up in a moment, you are safe as if nothing had happened

674
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,810
This is a hearing concerning after Desmond

675
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,780
For disobeying direct orders of his commander of his commander in chief

676
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,780
His defense Cape Hass

677
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,370
Cabo Hass

678
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:05,370
You want to submit a slogan of not guilty.

679
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:11,530
I thought you wanted out some kind of deal agreed

680
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,810
Yes sir, but changed his mind.

681
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:18,420
Just like that, he wants to proceed with a court martial.

682
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,730
Yes sir.

683
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,730
Well then put your hand out.

684
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:25,360
Forego.

685
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:33,290
Your Honor, Corporal deploys its morality as if it were some kind of

686
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:39,340
Badge of honor, he spends disobeying direct orders from their commanders.

687
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,450
When the best of our young people are sacrificing their lives.

688
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,240
You're good?

689
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,240
- and

690
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,440
They are still out? - Yes sir.

691
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,440
OK, take this in.

692
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,440
- I can not, strictly only military personnel.

693
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,560
Well, if you can not one of them will take you inside.

694
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,560
Not help, they are trying to involve him

695
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,560
There is only one question that military personnel need to make the accused.

696
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,050
You deny that disobeyed direct orders from Colonel?

697
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:13,400
Well, you did out?

698
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,090
- No sir I did not.

699
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,090
So because you are competing.

700
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:27,180
So why is it so important for you to deny a weapon to serve in a combat unit?

701
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,130
Since the Japanese attacked but Harbor, I took staff.

702
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,660
All he knew were angry, unaccommodating.

703
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,890
There were two men in my village.

704
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,800
Declared with biplane which committed suicide for being unable to serve.

705
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:55,580
I have a job in the firm and I could have taken but that's not right.

706
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:04,890
It is not right and that another man has to fight and die while I'm at home sitting safe

707
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,890
I need to serve.

708
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,000
I have the energy and passion to serve as a doctor,

709
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:17,010
right in the middle with the other boys no less danger alone ...

710
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:21,850
While everyone else is taking life I will be saving her

711
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:27,280
With the world also turning into 1000 pieces.

712
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,090
I do not dislike put some pieces back again.

713
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,920
Sorry sir you are not permitted.

714
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,920
- No, you do not understand my son is the defendant

715
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,300
I understand sir, but is not allowed

716
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,300
- I have information.

717
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,500
Thus it is indicating that the church can not doubt so.

718
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,530
What the hell's going on outside.

719
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,530
And Déjenlo.

720
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,060
This isa uniform war.

721
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,610
- What is Mr.

722
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:10,610
Lord need to show this with all respect.

723
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,290
- You're not miembrode the military, you can not be here sorry.

724
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,180
It is truly the way it works sir?

725
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,690
Fight for your country and give all of you and are over you.

726
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:27,000
The uniform is forgotten and you have no voice

727
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,530
You were released.

728
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,530
I was in Anabello Wood

729
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,020
Awarded times so I can see

730
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,920
I guess you're the father of the accused

731
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,920
- I am a master, Thomas Dawson

732
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,440
Then as a member of the military you know that there are laws here.

733
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,410
I know the law and that the law protects my son, and is marked in our constitution

734
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:52,380
And I believe in them as it does, and have fought to protect.

735
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,200
At least that's what I think he did because if it was not for that.

736
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,320
So I do not know what the hell is what I was doing Mr.

737
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,490
Thanks soldier Dawson let me see the letter

738

You must go.

740
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,100
The rights of the defendant are aware of an opponent and is protected

741
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:39,560
By Congress and can force you not resign these rights

742
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:44,810

Mr. withdraw the charges.

746
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Now this case is solved.

747
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:05,000
Cape Dawson are free to enter the hell of battle without a gun to protect you.

748
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:10,770
You can continue your duties, and merge as a combat medic

749
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,300
Where is it.

750
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,300

- Clear the way.

760
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,320
96, or what remains of them.

761
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,440
They are the ones we replace.

762
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:12,040
It sounds good to me, walking.

763
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,040
All clear sergeant.

764
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,820

01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,300
I'm the lieutenant mangl 96

766
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,300
We were assigned to you sir.

767
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,260
Ok, let's give these men a little space - Yes sir.

768
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,260
This is Sergeant Hall

769
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:45,940
Sit

770
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,940
who is Dawson?

771
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,260

You Dawson?

773
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,690
Erick shlelter

774
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,700
Your I and Peach here, are the only doctors we have in this area so

775
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
I guess we'll be working together

776
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:15,120
- They just out of line. - How is it?

777
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,850
I asked how?

778
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,260
Horrible

779
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,240
We try to go six times, and six times threw us out.

780
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,460
The last time there was nothing of the 96

781
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,620
- They are animals...

782
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,090
Stinky animals.

783
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:48,250
They do not care if they die, they want to die

784
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,250
They continue to you

785
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,250
And you never want to surrender.

786
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:54,450
Taking

787
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,900
Take this friend.

788
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:04,370
The Japanese deliberately targeted the wounded.

789
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,850
Lose all your medical symbols.

790
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,640
They have a prize for giving doctors.

791
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,400
Take your porthole.

792
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,620
Takes you a new helmet.

793
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,300
medium size and fits.

794
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,210
That is our goal, that cliff.

795
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:33,580
If we take maybe we get Hokinava

796
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:36,980
Now we get to Japan Okinawa

797
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,850
Take a breath, our friends in the Marina will warm them up for us

798
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,820
no one can survive that

799
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:13,360
oh but they can

800
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:36,130

- Right

802
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:55,170
Yes sir that's the back but in an assault, it's all different.

803
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,940
Soldiers, move!

804
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,600
It is blood.

805
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,600
Really?

806
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,380

Make way, take off the road.

810
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:17,580
Ron

811
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:18,280

812
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,280
Give it to Desmond

813
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,420
Oh shit

814
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,410
Resistan

815
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,120
Where the hell are they?

816
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,120
- I can not see them.

817
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,120
We need to get out.

818
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,500
They've given ,. Hand on that.

819
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,090
We'll get you out of here, come with me.

820
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,440
Continue forward.

821
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:23,930
Is that?

822
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,930
I do not know, just shoot.

823
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,560
Arise, let

824
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,380

You're good?

827
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,410
- I'm fine.

828
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,770
Come on, I have a friend, breathe.

You're okay, you're okay.

831
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,060
Just breathe, breathe.

832
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,860
I have you, I have.

833
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,600
Hey, give him some morphine and move.

834
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,680
Not lived a day.

835
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,680
Dr. No please, no, do not leave me.

836
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,680
Please do not leave me.

837
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,580
My children, my son.

838
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,580
Please do not leave me.

839
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:44,640
I will not go anywhere, I'll take you home. Okay?

840
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,640
I'll take you home.

841

Priority? He'll be dead before I get down.

848
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:31,370
He does not know it.

849
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,370
Lower him, okay?

850
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,370

I will take it.

854
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,970
They do not see us and we do not see.

855
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,640
I think they were not expecting.

856
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,640
Come on. Give me a hand.

857
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,460

01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,970
Connelly and Henry dead in the first 15 minutes, and nothing else.

911
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,960
Peterson, Papay.

912
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,080
- Stanford and Murphy

913
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,080

914
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,930
- Rollingstone

915
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:08,840
In peace the sons bury their fathers, in war fathers bury their children.

916
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,370
You can stop saying that crap?

917
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,730
Not help them.

918
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:22,160
If you understand that, not here.

919
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,640
- Hey...

920
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:27,890

You should look for a hole?

925
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,970
- Sounds good to me.

926
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:58,970
Put on your helmet.

927
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,440
You are about to commit?

928
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,300
I do not eat meat, help yourself.

929
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:19,260
Of course you do not eat meat.

930
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,180
-That's why they do not care

931
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,000
He not find it an option

932
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,620
Yes it is.

933
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:46,010
Do not say that.

934
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,610
I'd be happier with a man like me anyway

935
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,610
until you know if

936
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:54,820
I'm a imbesil Sometimes.?

937
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:56,820
Some?

938
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:01,250
Ok, ok

939
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:29,840
These Japanese are elusive.

940
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:33,160
I'll take the first watch, I'll rest.

941
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,560
No.

942
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:20,120
A bad dream.

943
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,120
almost scare me

944
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,410
-I could not do anything

945
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,410
-the rifles if

946
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,620
No bite

947
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,100
- Yes, he will do it.

948
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:57,640
This decision look to your around.

949
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,640
- It is not all there.

950
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,920
And the same men would be screaming for a weapon.

951
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,480
I would not be excited about that.

952
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:11,740
My father is a drunk.

953
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:18,570
I fight against it for many years but went on and on and turned bad.

954
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:23,840
At least you know, mine could be any of Tonga and do not mind said

955
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,770
So is your mother who raised you?

956
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:29,770
- I met her, but gave me to an orphanage when he was five.

957
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,770
I never saw her again.

958
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:35,700
Do not judge quickly.

959
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:40,360
Judging fast people can take to go wrong

960
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:54,540
My father used to hit me and my brother just because he felt sad.

961
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,020
I can handle that.

962
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,460
But when I did with my mother.

963
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,940
And it is enough just.

964
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,940
Did you hear me?

965
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,940
Forward pull the trigger

966
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,940
Detente.

967
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,020
But you did not kill him?

968
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,160
- In my heart I did.

969
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,860
And that's where I made my promise to God that I would not touch a gun again.

970
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:06,100
And you would no longer mine because you're crazy.

971
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,570
Move, bring in his men here

972
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:36,420
Retire, we stand down.

973
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,360
This is Sergeant asking support team six immediate help

974
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,360
Under 1.5

975
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,640
If I know where we are, but we do not expect much.

976
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,280
I ordered an artillery attack.

977
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,960

What are you going to do?

983
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,760
- Keep pressure on it.

984
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:36,980
I do not need it, give it to him, I'll be fine.

985
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,980
Go Go.

986
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,980

I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

991
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:27,410
You will feel a picket line.

992
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:32,090

What do you want from me?

1000
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:14,610
