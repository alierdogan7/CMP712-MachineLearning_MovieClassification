You'll be contagious

during which time, it is imperative

78
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:47,642

If they drink any small
amount and your saliva mixes,

Now, one important thing to mention...

114

you can only get the booster shot once,

115
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:27,972

116
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:33,041

spread the contagious cure...

down in exchange for pardons.

give us the best shot at that.

129

safer for us to stay put...

709
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:56,205
I would have stood by my decision.

710
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:58,123
I would have counted on that.

711
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:02,878
But I would have given you a
sterling character reference.

712
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,348
Of course, you wouldn't have needed mine.

713
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:09,108
You would have gotten 204 of those.

714
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,187
Great dress, by the way.
