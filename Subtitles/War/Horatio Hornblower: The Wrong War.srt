1
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:06,024
(<i>hooves clattering</i>)

2
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,839
Man:
Captain Pellew.

3
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:19,205
Come in, Sir.

4
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,843
My apologies
for requiring you

5
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:22,936
at such short notice.

6
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:24,002
Not at all, my lord.

7
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,346
Captain Pellew,
may I introduce

8
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,214
General the Baron
de Charette

9
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:33,086
commander in chief of
His Majesty King Louis'
army in exile.

10
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,482
The general is going
to invade France...

11
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,491
and we're going
to help him.

12
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:59,744
Once your ships
have carried us
across the channel

13
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,148
We shall raise
an army of the people

14
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,811
and march on Paris

15
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:08,324
to restore His most
Catholic Majesty
to the throne.

16
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,586
May I ask, Sir

17
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,458
how many men you
expect to raise

18
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,019
for this... army?

19
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:15,724
Within a matter of days

20
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:19,496
I shall have, uh, 10,000,
maybe 20,000 men in arms.

21
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,003
Then we shall move east

22
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,039
gathering more as we go.

23
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:27,566
Never doubt the loyatty
of the people, monsieur.

24
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,545
(<i>gasps</i>)

25
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:43,616
(<i>scissors snipping</i>)

26
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,556
I understand, sir, that in fact

27
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:54,400
arms have been raised against
the rebel government before.

28
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,234
Certainly, many times.

29
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,274
Without any success.

30
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,973
Captain Pellew

31
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,172
for five years
I have lived in exile

32
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:08,411
(<i>spews</i>):
While traitors have
laid waste to my country.

33
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:12,114
Well, now the nobility
of France is going home

34
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,625
and this time,
when my countrymen fight

35
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:19,184
we, their rightful leaders,
will lead them into battle.

36
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:23,995
Can I not take it, sir

37
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,695
that we have your support
in this great venture?

38
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,034
Hood:
Oh, yes, Baron

39
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:33,509
you can depend on Captain
Pellew's full support.

40
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:37,069
You have His Britannic
Majesty's word on it.

41
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,377
(<i>coughs</i>)

42
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,980
(<i>dog barks in background</i>)

43
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,252
(<i>coughs</i>)

44
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,963
How do I look?

45
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:02,096
The most startling
improvement, if I
may say so, sir.

46
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:15,143
(<i>panting</i>)

47
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,585
So with two shirts, hat,
breeches, buttons and buckles

48
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,145
the sum is £11

49
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:22,054
nine shillings
and threepence.

50
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,456
Ah.

51
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,291
Perhaps pinchbeck
instead of silver

52
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,352
for the shoe buckles?

53
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,762
That would make it,
um...

54
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,959
shall we say £11 even?

55
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,730
Very well, Mr. Collins.

56
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:37,672
Hood:
I assure you, the baron
is still a figurehead

57
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,971
amongst those
loyal to King Louis.

58
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,840
His name will
provide the spark

59
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,743
sets all northern
France afire.

60
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,338
But the royalist
force, my lord?

61
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,382
They're nothing more

62
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,247
than the remnants
of a defeated army.

63
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,343
A final cast
of the dice,
I grant you.

64
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,251
Indeed, sir,
and a desperate one.

65
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:54,517
Ah, you forget
what is at stake,
Sir Edward.

66
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,819
For the cost
of ferrying

67
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:57,257
General Charette
and his men

68
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:58,259
across the channel

69
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:01,559
we can put an end to
the war with France.

70
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:04,031
Surely, even in
your estimation

71
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:07,764
it's a trifling effort
for a place in history.

72
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:10,432
Yes, but if
the expedition
should fail, sir

73
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:12,099
what of the cost in lives?

74
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:14,973
Men die every day
this war continues.

75
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:16,307
When it's over

76
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,109
we may count costs
at our leisure.

77
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:22,709
(<i>man groaning</i>)

78
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,880
Make way.
Make way.

79
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,014
(<i>gasping</i>)

80
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,819
My lord, my lord.

81
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:29,620
Speak up, man!

82
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:30,751
The orders!

83
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:31,919
Well?

84
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,997
(<i>gasps</i>)

85
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,657
Gone, my lord.

86
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,223
Pox on them.

87
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:40,070
(<i>men whispering</i>)

88
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,935
My lord?

89
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:45,805
He was carrying a copy
of General Charette's plan

90
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,275
to the first lord.

91
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:49,938
Oh, my God.

92
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,981
What if they fall
into enemy hands?

93
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,538
Well, we do not
know that.

94
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:55,881
They may be at
the bottom of the Thames.

95
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,647
The thieves drunk
in a tavern.

96
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,848
Sir, what if they're not?

97
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:03,359
His Majesty's government
has decided

98
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:06,793
and they are not in the business
of changing their minds.

99
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:09,024
Should General Charette
know of this?

100
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,535
I don't believe there's
any need to trouble him.

101
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:16,299
What has passed here
will remain between ourselves.

102
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,136
Is that understood?

103
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,971
(<i>man gasping</i>)

104
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:21,806
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,779
However, since it
would not be politic

106
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,112
for King Louis to think

107
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:30,847
that we might have cast
his general ashore unaided

108
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,718
you will remain
on station

109
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,257
after the general
has disembarked.

110
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:37,122
And if worse comes to worst

111
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,061
you can provide him
with a means of escape.

112
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,722
As you wish, sir.

113
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,390
Very well.

114
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:46,060
You have your orders,
Captain Pellew.

115
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,262
Carry on, sir.

116
00:06:56,513 --> 00:07:00,381
(<i>hooves clattering past</i>)

117
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,542
Mr. Hornblower.

118
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:02,710
Sir.

119
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,481
Well, don't stand
there dawdling, sir.

120
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,784
We must return to Plymouth
as soon as possible.

121
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:14,786
(<i>gulls cawing</i>)

122
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,002
Man:
Go on.

123
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:57,536
Lay down your oars.

124
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:03,145
(<i>blowing boatswain whistles</i>)

125
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,011
Welcome aboard, sir.

126
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:11,610
A profitable meeting
at the admiratty,
I trust?

127
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,122
Quite satisfactory,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

128
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,626
Signal the ships <i>Dumbarton,</i>
<i>Sophia</i> and <i>Catherine</i>

129
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,424
and request the attendance
of their captains in one hour.

130
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:23,057
Mr. Hornblower, my compliments
to the senior officers.

131
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,124
I will see them
in my cabin in 20 minutes.

132
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,634
Aye, sir.

133
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,797
So, Mr. Hornblower,
what news?

134
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,307
I know no more than you,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

135
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,141
Well, I expect
we shall find out.

136
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,270
By the way, I think

137
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,042
you have a splash
of mud on your jacket.

138
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:40,514
Ah, ha-ha.

139
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,882
You look every inch
the new lieutenant,
Mr. Hornblower.

140
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,353
Long may it remain so.

141
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:52,586
(<i>general conversation</i>)

142
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,129
Gentlemen,
captain's compliments

143
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,825
and he will see all officers
in his cabin in 20 minutes.

144
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,094
Kennedy:
What? Who's this?

145
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:59,692
Gentlemen,
it appears

146
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,760
we have a stranger
in our midst.

147
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:04,204
No, no...
I'm mistaken.

148
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,674
It's Lieutenant
Hornblower

149
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,337
from top to toe
a new man.

150
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:11,505
(<i>ship's bell rings</i>)

151
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,515
And not a patch in sight.

152
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,518
Indeed it is,
acting Lieutenant Kennedy.

153
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,417
Gentlemen, it appears
that Mr. Hornblower

154
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,455
is now the standard

155
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,353
by which we must all
measure ourselves.

156
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,619
All right, all right,
that's enough.

157
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,092
Thank you, Mr. Bowles.

158
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:27,686
Styles:
Oi! Watch it.

159
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,725
What do you reckon

160
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,530
the orders will be,
then, eh?

161
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,195
Stay here
and take it easy.

162
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:36,966
Not unless
the captain's gone soft.

163
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,974
Naw. Pity, though.

164
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,977
I could just do
with another month
on fresh rations.

165
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,104
Maybe we'll be sent
to the Indies, eh?

166
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,112
How about that?

167
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,409
Palm trees, sunshine.

168
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:47,814
Tropical diseases.

169
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:49,978
Could be the Med again.

170
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,543
Have another go at them dagos.

171
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:52,610
Yeah, we
could go back

172
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,350
and give them
another pasting, easy.

173
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:55,550
Do it on our own,
too.

174
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,616
Leave the rest
of the fleet
in the channel.

175
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:03,588
Oi, fanny fearless,
missed a bit.

176
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,598
Where?

177
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,464
Behind you.

178
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:08,971
Where?

179
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:16,846
(<i>all laughing</i>)

180
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,612
Gentlemen,
as you are no doubt aware

181
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:24,346
I have lately returned from
a meeting with Admiral Hood.

182
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,254
Our orders are
to join the ships

183
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:30,190
<i>Catherine,</i>
<i>Dumbarton</i> and <i>Sophia</i>

184
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,091
and convey
a General Charette

185
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,459
together with forces

186
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,862
comprising of French
royalist troops

187
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,866
and British infantry

188
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,801
to the coast of France.

189
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,132
An invasion, sir?

190
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,467
Mr. Kennedy, four ships

191
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,838
could hardly constitute
an invasion, sir.

192
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,069
Then what is the point, sir?

193
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,110
The point, Mr. Bowles

194
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:49,736
is that we are at war, sir.

195
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,338
And when at war, we react
to an order without hesitation.

196
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,213
(<i>gulls cawing</i>)

197
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:59,312
Um... I understand, gentlemen

198
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,688
this plan may seem
somewhat... cavalier.

199
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,286
However, it is
the general's plan,
once landed

200
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,490
to raise an army
with which to march on Paris

201
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,000
and place King Louis
on the throne.

202
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,660
That would mean an end
to the war, sir.

203
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,727
I believe that is
the intention, Mr. Bracegirdle.

204
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:16,965
Sir, are we permitted
to know

205
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,837
where the general's troops
will be landing?

206
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,671
No, our destination
will remain secret

207
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,904
until we set sail,
and then there is no chance

208
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,038
of word reaching the French
until we arrive.

209
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,050
In the meantime,
I want all dispatch
in the loading

210
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,676
of the general's men
and supplies as soon

211
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:30,684
as they arrive.

212
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:31,742
Thank you, gentlemen.

213
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:36,325
(<i>officers murmuring</i>)

214
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:42,026
Perhaps next week we could
be toasting the downfall

215
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:44,191
of the French
Republic, sir.

216
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:45,894
Yes, Mr. Hornblower.

217
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,301
That is the plan, at least.

218
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,145
(<i>gulls cawing</i>)

219
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:03,013
Styles, let's get those bales
loaded as soon as possible.

220
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,629
Frogs?

221
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:17,257
What the bloody hell
are they doing here?

222
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:35,147
Well, what do you
make of them, Horatio?

223
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,152
They seem a little...

224
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,381
Hornblower:
Disorderly.

225
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:42,083
The word "shambles"
might be more appropriate.

226
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:46,595
(<i>playing</i>
<i>"The Girl I Left Behind"</i>)

227
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,796

229
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:10,284
Morning, gentlemen.

Major Edrington, 95th foot.

231
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,916
I've been told someone here

232
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,513
can see to the embarkation
of my men

233
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:15,523
onto the <i>Indefatigable.</i>

234
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:16,923
Lieutenant Hornblower.

235
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,927
Acting Lieutenant
Kennedy, sir.

236
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,519
I will see to it myself.

237
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:21,291
Excellent.

238
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,423
Your men look
very fine, Major.

239
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:25,364
Almost too good
for battle.

240
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,995
Really? I usually find
that the more able the officer

241
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:29,663
the better turned out the men.

242
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,832
Commanding officer:
Battalions...

243
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,466
At least in the army.

244
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,738

if you were to address me
as "my lord."

you will extend to them

Not these frogs, Styles.

00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:23,154
These are the good frogs.

347

A frog is a frog, sir.

And the only good frog
is a dead frog, sir.

This'll end badly,
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

Put the chicken back, Styles.

357
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,650
But, sir...

00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,956
Yes, sir.

360
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,586
(<i>knocking on door</i>)

361
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,393
Come.

362
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,866
Hornblower:
Report from the
quarterdeck, sir.

363
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,630
Wind still
from the north,
course steady.

364
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:08,829
Thank you, Mr. Hornblower.

365
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,006
Mr. Hornblower?

366
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,006
Sir?

367
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,976
A word, if you please.

368
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:23,044
How are the men taking to their
new traveling companions?

369
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,552
As one might expect, sir.

370
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,350
They have a few misgivings
about their presence

371
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:28,651
but nothing untoward.

372
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,624
Misgivings?
What kind of misgivings?

373
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,593
I think they have
a little difficutty

374
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,721
in seeing the general's
troops as allies

375
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,322
when only yesterday
any Frenchman was the enemy.

376
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,697
You have made it clear

377
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,429
they must give the general
their full support?

378
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:41,731
Oh, yes, sir, very clear.

379
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,666
Good, good.

380
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,077
And yourself?

381
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:54,481
What do you, um, think of the
general and, uh, his plan?

382
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:59,414
I think he is bold, sir.

383
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,716
Bold?

384
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,223
Is that all?

385
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,988
Without knowing either the
general or his plan in detail

386
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:08,189
I wouldn't presume
to judge, sir.

387
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,562
Oh, a prudent enough answer.

388
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,831
There is also some speculation
about our destination, sir.

389
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:17,134
What would you say
if I were to tell you

390
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,606
we were heading
for the coast of Brittany?

391
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:23,076
What would be
your guess then?

392
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:26,046
In that case, I would say
Quiberon Bay, sir.

393
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:28,083
Would you?

394
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,617
Why?

395
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:33,451
From my recollection, Quiberon
affords a good landing.

396
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,285
It is the logical choice.

397
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:37,325
Your deduction is correct.

398
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:42,396
Let us pray, Mr. Hornblower

399
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,060
that the French Republicans
don't share your logic.

400
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,626
Otherwise, Quiberon Bay
may not be

401
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,138
such a welcoming spot
after all.

402
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:13,689
(<i>man shouts orders</i>)

403
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:23,198
We have to stop the artillery
of the republic here

404
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:26,537
from moving against us
through Muzillac

405
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,272
west to Quiberon, here.

406
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:35,576
<i>Alors,</i>
le Colonel Moncoutant

407
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:38,017
he will lead
a group of men

408
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:42,285
to take control of the bridge
at Muzillac, here.

409
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:44,952
Le colonel is, uh,
Marquis du Muzillac.

410
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:48,190
He's, um, the, uh,
the lord of that village

411
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:50,698
so he knows the region
very well.

412
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:51,630
Oh, you must be glad

413
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,531
to be returning home
to Muzillac, Colonel.

414
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:55,229
No doubt the people
will welcome you.

415
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,398
Most of them will,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

416
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:00,806
Some will be sorry to see me

417
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:03,936
but I shall be glad
of the encounter.

418
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,247
Um, Colonel Moncoutant
requires the company
of infantry

419
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,255
to secure or destroy
the bridge at Muzillac.

420
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:15,551
Major Edrington?

421
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:18,593
I believe my men
are up to the task, Captain.

422
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,561
Monsieur, I protest;
as Lord of Muzillac

423
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,393
the honor of defending the
bridge should fall to my men.

424
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:25,831
With respect, Colonel,
your men have not seen action

425
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,391
for several years, whereas...

426
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:30,267
Do you question the competence
of our French troops, Major?

427
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,466
Merely their lack
of recent experience.

428
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,974
So you do question them.
<i>Non!</i>

429
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:36,273
I will not allow it!

430
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:38,609
Gentlemen, surely we
are all allies here.

431
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,740
As long as our campaign
is successful

432
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,374
we will all share
the honors.

433
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:44,646
Charette:
Monsieur Hornblower is right.

434
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,280
To restore the king,
that is our only concern.

435
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,290
As you wish, Colonel.

436
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,565
May I suggest, Colonel,
that one of my officers

437
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,159
act as liaison
between yourself
and Lord Edrington.

438
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:03,569
You seem to have a grasp of
the situation, Mr. Hornblower.

439
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:07,575
Perhaps you'd like
to volunteer?

440
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:10,476
Yes, sir.

441
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:11,604
(<i>sailors chatting</i>)

442
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,184
(<i>French troops conversing</i>)

443
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:26,122
We'll be taking
two 12-pounders

444
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:28,356
and enough powder
to destroy a bridge.

445
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,557
Uh, what size is
the bridge, sir?

446
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,601
Well, I'd imagine
it's a bit bigger

447
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,101
than the river,
Matthews.

448
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,829
Sir?

449
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:40,075
Uh, never mind.

450
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:41,838
Um, take ten extra
powder casks to be sure.

451
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,310
Aye aye, sir.

452
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:45,313
Styles:
Begging your pardon,
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

453
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,144
Why can't the French
use their own cannon?

454
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:48,308
Styles.

455
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,011
It might have escaped
your notice, Styles

456
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:52,212
but General Charette's
troops don't have
any cannon.

457
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:54,984
Well, I don't mind letting
them take ours, sir.

458
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:57,787
Yesterday you were
prepared to hang a man
for taking a chicken

459
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,953
but today, you're willing
to give him our guns.

460
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:00,996
Very generous.

461
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:03,293
Decided the French
are all right after all

462
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:05,299
have you, Styles?

463
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,426
No.

464
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:11,769
Your men are reluctant
to go ashore with us?

465
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,434
On the contrary, sir,
they're all quite eager.

466
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,704
I am happy
to hear it.

467
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,678
With the help
of your men

468
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:20,044
I hope to see
my home restored

469
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:22,709
to something of
its former glory.

470
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:24,844
They will do everything
in their power, sir.

471
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,151
I think you are
a stranger to my country

472
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,918
Mr. Hornblower.

473
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:34,929
You cannot imagine
what these republicans
are capable of.

474
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:37,898
There is no place
they would not defile.

475
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,265
Nothing they would
not besmirch.

476
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:43,669
Let us hope
your fears are unfounded.

477
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:44,899
Hmm.

478
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:47,169
You do not know
these people.

479
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:50,234
They are barbarians.

480
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:56,046
But order will be restored,
monsieur, you may depend on it.

481
00:25:56,118 --> 00:25:59,610
(<i>ship's bell rings</i>)

482
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:14,731
Captain, landing beach
in sight, sir.

483
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:15,827
Very good, Mr. Bowles.

484
00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:16,996
All hands shorten sail.

485
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,801
Aye aye, sir.

486
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:22,207
All hands, shorten sail!

487
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:24,745
(<i>whistle blows</i>)

488
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:26,747
Mr. Hornblower,
the beach is in sight.

489
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,612
Prepare to disembark,
if you please.

490
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,584
Aye aye, sir.

491
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:33,146
Mr. Hornblower.

492
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:34,154
Sir?

493
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:35,815
You will be
on foreign soil

494
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,188
the enemy
all around.

495
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,954
Be on your guard,
take care.

496
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,360
And do not assume
a situation is safe

497
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,399
until you can convince
yourself that it is so.

498
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:45,398
I will keep it
in mind, sir.

499
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,399
Good.

500
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:49,403
I trust you will not abandon your
prudence of yesterday.

501
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,631
No, no, sir, I will not.

502
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:53,332
Carry on, Mr. Hornblower.

503
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:05,414
You are, uh, concerned
for his safety, Captain.

504
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:09,753
I am concerned for
the safety of all
my men, General.

505
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:13,261
But the, uh, lieutenant
in particular, huh?

506
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:15,592
He's one of my
best officers.

507
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:18,360
And despite his
lack of years, I...

508
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,629
I would regret
his loss.

509
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,138
Then let me
reassure you.

510
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:26,231
I am confident
that within a few days

511
00:27:26,308 --> 00:27:28,503
the whole of France
will be behind us.

512
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:30,602
And then your young lieutenant

513
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,239
will be able
to tell his grandchildren

514
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:36,580
how he helped restore
the flag of King Louis

515
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,210
to its rightful place

516
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:42,917
to fly once more
over the sacred soil of France.

517
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:49,196
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

518
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:51,129

<i>Vive le roi!</i>

Man 1:
Company, fall in!

520
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:56,996
Fall in on the right!

521
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,404
Man 2:
Number two company,
over here!

522
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,144
Man:
Forward, right!

(<i>all grunting</i>)

525
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,269
Archie, so,
how does it feel

526
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,873
to be back on this side
of the channel?

527
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,975
Better with a pistol
and cannon to hand.

528
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,077
We're going to need
some kind of transport

529
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,180
to get the guns
and powder to the bridge.

530
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:50,885
I'll see what Colonel
Moncoutant has in mind.

531
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:58,123
<i>Fait attention!</i>
<i>Idiots!</i>

<i>Vous etes fou!</i>

533
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,873
He worries more about that
machine than anything else.

534
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:13,039
At this rate, it will be the only
thing to reach Muzillac.

535
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:15,379
Are your men ready to move,
Mr. Hornblower?

536
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,213
Yes, my lord, save
for our cannon.

537
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:20,221
By god, if that's any of ours, I'll
have them flogged.

538
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,348
Those are the French
troops, I believe.

539
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,614
It would be.

540
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,285
What do they think
they're here for?

541
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,625
Gentlemen, you are ready
to advance?

542
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:29,789
<i>My</i> men are ready, sir.

543
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:30,854
What are you saying?

544
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,366
Colonel, I believe
we still require

545
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:33,492
transport for our cannon.

546
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,594
That is already taken care of.

547
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,137
When you are ready,
we will proceed.

548
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:44,611
Muzillac awaits, gentlemen.

549
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:50,285
(<i>man coughs</i>)

550
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:51,683
This stuff bloody stinks.

551
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,983
Least they could have done
was clear out.

552
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:56,047
Styles, let's have
less griping there.

553
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,087
Just be glad
you're not

554
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:01,755
carrying those cannons
all the way to the village.

555
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,401
From acting lieutenant
to commander of a dung cart

556
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:10,938
in no more than a step.

557
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:12,667
My career's looking up.

558
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:14,333
Mr. Hornblower
as you and I are

559
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:15,808
the senior
British officers

560
00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:17,742
I think we should
advance together.

561
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,110
(<i>horse snorts</i>)

562
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:20,975
Come, sir.

563
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,414
Unless you prefer
the dung cart?

564
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:35,094
(<i>grunts</i>)

565
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:38,122
(<i>groans in frustration</i>)

566
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,403
I see now why you
chose the navy.

567
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,672
All men and supplies
ashore, sir.

568
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:50,734
All boats returned.

569
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:52,074
Thank you,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

570
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:53,614
Signal all ships
to make sail.

571
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:54,614
Aye aye, sir.

572
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:55,615
Mr. Bowles!

573
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:56,616
Sir.

574
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:57,652
Set course for
Quiberon, please.

575
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,651
Aye aye, sir.

576
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,119
Pellew:
We shall head west

577
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,952
to land General Charette's
main force.

578
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,620
(<i>coughing</i>)

579
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:48,562
Course, Mr. Bowles?

580
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:49,899
West by north,
sir.

581
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:52,030
Be there by noon
with this wind, sir.

582
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,075
Could've been sent for us.

583
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:57,404
Perhaps.

584
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,174
When we get to Quiberon,
Mr. Bowles

585
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,943
I want you to heave to
as close in shore as possible.

586
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:05,111
Once unloading is complete, we
shall remain there on station.

587
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:06,620
Remain, sir? I thought...

588
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,986
The <i>Sophia, Dumbarton</i>
and <i>Catherine</i>

589
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:14,051
will return home to England,
but we...

590
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,323
we stay.

591
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,726
Well, Mr. Hornblower,
there is our objective.

592
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,632
Do you think you can hold it?

593
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:57,171
We must... either hold it
or destroy it.

594
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,264
General Charette
is counting on us.

595
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:00,831
Well, in that case...

596
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,723
Major Edrington,
you will find a ford

597
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,996
half a league upstream
beyond the village.

598
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:29,502
You will station your men
there in due course.

599
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:31,835
I only hope we're up to it,
Colonel.

600
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,479
Mr. Kennedy, have the men
set up the cannon

601
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,848
to cover the southern approach.

602
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,443
We'll see about setting
the gunpowder

603
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,851
when I return from the village.

604
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,890
Aye aye, Mr. Hornblower.

605
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:53,021
You heard, Matthews.

606
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:54,083
Aye aye, sir.

607
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:17,216
Quiberon Bay, sir.

608
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:20,311
Very good,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

609
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:22,481
Take us in shore
and heave to.

610
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:23,546
Aye aye, sir.

611
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,593
(<i>whistles</i>)

612
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:32,196
Now my people
will welcome me home.

613
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:33,598
<i>En avant.</i>

614
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:48,942

617
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:11,304
a signal
from the <i>Catherine.</i>

618
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:13,933
They are ready to begin
disembarking the troops.

619
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,271
Very good,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

620
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:16,571
Make our own
preparations.

621
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:17,612
Aye aye, sir.

622
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:26,818
General, I would deem it a favor

623
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:29,015
if you would allow
one of my officers

624
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,253
to accompany you ashore
to send back regular reports.

625
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:34,460
Reports?

626
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:35,461
Yes.

627
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,964
Admiral Lord Hood
has ordered that we remain here

628
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,660
until your progress is assured.

629
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:41,930
But, why?

630
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:44,369
I believe the admiral wishes us
to remain here

631
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,838
as a place of retreat

632
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,740
in case you meet heavier
resistance than anticipated.

633
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,938
Very well, Sir Edward.

634
00:35:52,013 --> 00:35:54,846
I thank you for your honesty.

635
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:57,043
But, uh, I can assure you

636
00:35:57,118 --> 00:36:01,077
these reports,
they will carry only good news.

637
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,350
I pray so, sir.

638
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,519
(<i>softly</i>):
I pray so.

00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,194

He says he is the mayor.

649
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,762
You are the linen merchant.

650
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,927
Your business is underwear.

651
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:23,766
Not any longer, monsieur.

652
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:25,032
And by authority of...

00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,596
Authority?

654
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:27,972
You have no authority.

You regret?

659
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:39,516
I want the people brought
out here to welcome me home.

660

You have no right

669

to arrest them.

670
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:58,192
They have done nothing.

No right?

By what right have you
destroyed my home?

They had no practical use.

683
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,175
They were used as fuel
for the fires.

He can do us no harm.

717
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:44,856
All is well.

718
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,809
<i>Je suis le marquis.</i>

719
00:42:00,882 --> 00:42:02,179
<i>Il faut m'obeir.</i>

720
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:04,976
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

721
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:07,146
French troops:
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

722
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:13,352
Mademoiselle,
take these children away.

723
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:16,659
Thank you, monsieur.

724
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,062
Uh... thank you.

725
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:24,368
I take it the welcoming
ceremony is now over.

726
00:42:41,856 --> 00:42:43,517
(<i>people cheering</i>)

727
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:49,991
You see,
Monsieur Bowles

728
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:52,055
the people, they are
happy to see us.

729
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:53,464
Aye, sir.

730
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:56,401
I had thought to meet more
resistance than this.

731
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:59,872
The Republicans, they have
no stomach to fight.

732
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:01,135
(<i>men grunting</i>)

733
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:13,815
That's right...
bit more, Styles.

734
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:18,022
That's three barrels
placed, sir.

735
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:18,956
This'll be
the fourth.

736
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:20,085
I reckon that'll
be enough

737
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:21,822
to bring this down
when the time comes.

738
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:23,659
I think we'll put
two more barrels

739
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,631
over the side here,
just to be sure.

740
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,429
Matthews:
Begging your
pardon, sir

741
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:30,994
But, uh, if the enemy's
expected from that side

742
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,233
and when we blow
the bridge up

743
00:43:33,307 --> 00:43:35,332
we're going to be
that side.

744
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,674
How do we get back
to the beach?

745
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:38,769
We don't.

746
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:40,746
We hold this position
at all costs.

747
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:42,339
Surrounded by frogs
and no escape.

748
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:43,406
Styles.

749
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:45,145
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

750
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:47,653
There's more than bloody frogs
down here, sir.

751
00:43:47,722 --> 00:43:48,882
(<i>chuckling</i>)

752
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:50,287
Carry on then.

753
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:51,325
Yes, sir.

754
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,561
Archie.

755
00:43:57,632 --> 00:44:00,795
Hmm? Yes?

756
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,062
I think
I'll go and see

757
00:44:02,136 --> 00:44:04,604
how Major Edrington
is faring at the ford.

758
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:05,832
Will you take charge?

759
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:09,502
Yes, yes, of course.

760
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:12,341
Matthews is right,
though, Horatio.

761
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:14,813
If we have to blow up
the bridge

762
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:16,349
we will be cut off.

763
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:18,578
I know.

764
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:21,121
A fine thing, to die
in someone else's war.

765
00:44:29,464 --> 00:44:31,694
(<i>drum playing drill</i>)

766
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:44,472
Edrington:
S'arnt, send pickets
at front and flank

767
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:46,775
and across the river
to act as lookouts.

768
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:49,681
Man:
Very well, my lord.

769
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,115
My lord,
is everything well?

770
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:52,618
Well?

771
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,279
Look at this place,
Mr. Hornblower.

772
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:55,845
No artillery would
dare to cross here

773
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:56,912
and if they tried

774
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,959
my mama could
beat them off
with her parasol.

775
00:44:59,026 --> 00:45:00,653
They may send
infantry as well.

776
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:01,786
They may.

777
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:03,626
But to be plain,
my greatest fear

778
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:05,962
is that the enemy will ignore this
place attogether

779
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,398
and concentrate on the bridge.

780
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:08,526
And if they
should cross...

781
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:09,570
You do not
trust my men.

782
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:11,366
I do not doubt your men

783
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:13,339
but I have no confidence
that the frogs

784
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:15,034
would stand firm
and support you.

785
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:16,804
I see, but
General Charette...

786
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:18,209
General Charette isn't here.

787
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:20,645
Our commanding officer
is Colonel Moncoutant.

788
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:22,478
And from his earlier exhibition

789
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,576
it is clear that whatever
his rank, he is no soldier.

790
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:29,419
Never underestimate the
enemy, Mr. Hornblower

791
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,684
but never overestimate an ally

792
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:32,885
particularly one who is
caught up in his own affairs.

793
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,689
Better go and
report to him.

794
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:36,093
See what he's up to.

795
00:45:48,643 --> 00:45:49,940
(<i>whistles loudly</i>)

796
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:54,437
I think this is a good place
to make camp, monsieur Bowles.

797
00:45:54,515 --> 00:45:57,678
The men, they can rest
and tomorrow...

798
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:59,982
Tomorrow we
take Quiberon.

799

<i>On y va!</i>

800
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:05,857
Oh, damn this animal.

801
00:46:05,927 --> 00:46:07,690
What it needs
is a rudder.

802
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:10,663
Just show it
who's master,
Mr. Hornblower.

803
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:13,890
I don't need to, it knows.

804
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:16,300

(<i>bell tolling</i>)

806
00:46:29,483 --> 00:46:31,883
I've heard it said
that the guillotine

807
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:34,148
is as effective
at subduing trouble

808
00:46:34,222 --> 00:46:35,689
as an army
of 5,000 men.

809
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:37,724
I do not think it
would take 5,000 men

810
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:38,986
to subdue these people.

811
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,119
By the look of it,
a handful could do it.

812
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:43,686
<i>Vous avez vos ordres, allez.</i>

813
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:47,364

<i>Vite!</i>

Ah, <i>messieurs.</i>

823
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:24,230
Just the men I need.

824
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:26,398
Gentlemen... I trust
I will have the pleasure

825
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:28,032
of your company
at dinner tonight.

826
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,669
At dinner?

827
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:32,406
We look forward
to it, Colonel.

828
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,175
Excellent,
shall we say 8:00?

829
00:47:36,183 --> 00:47:37,616
Come, Mr. Hornblower.

830
00:47:37,685 --> 00:47:39,585
Our men will be
expecting us.

831
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:41,815
There is nothing
we can do here.

832
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:52,398
(<i>ship's bell rings</i>)

833
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:56,501
Message from Mr. Bowles, sir.

834
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,696
Well?

835
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,899
General Charette
has made camp for the night.

836
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:01,202
Has he met
any resistance?

837
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:02,207
No, sir.

838
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,005
That's good, surely?

839
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:06,672
Yes, but why
is it so easy?

840
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:10,046
The Republicans could have put
out lines of defense anywhere.

841
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,155
Unless...

842
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:16,689
Unless what, sir?

843
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:18,725
Mr. Bracegirdle,
have you wondered why it is

844
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:20,385
we have been ordered
to remain here?

845
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:22,122
I had assumed it was to provide

846
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:24,255
a place of retreat
for General Charette

847
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:26,732
should circumstances
have turned against him.

848
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:29,634
Aye, but only one ship when it
took four to bring him here?

849
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:33,572
So if General Charette
is indeed forced to retreat...

850
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,074
it is not expected
he will return

851
00:48:35,142 --> 00:48:37,576
with more than a quarter
of the men he set out with.

852
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,772
The mathematics of defeat,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

853
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:50,722
Moncoutant:
You see, gentlemen,
a republic...

854
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,759
a country run by peasants

855
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:56,160
is a contradiction
of all the natural laws.

856
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,697
Observe, if you will

857
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:01,030
how my house has suffered
during my absence.

858
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:02,763
The peasants could not
look after it

859
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:05,465
because they have no breeding
and thus no intelligence.

860
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:08,804
Entrust them with fine furniture,
paintings

861
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:12,778
they see only firewood.

862
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:17,250
They probably used my best
brandy to ignite the blaze.

863
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:19,843
(<i>all laugh</i>)

864
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,753
Forgive me, sir,
but I have always
held it true

865
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:26,623
that any man may better himself,
however humble his situation.

866
00:49:26,694 --> 00:49:27,888
But to what purpose?

867
00:49:27,962 --> 00:49:31,159
Monsieur, I remember
I once had a horse

868
00:49:31,232 --> 00:49:33,223
which, uh, for amusement

869
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,861
I taught to count off
the days of the week.

870
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:38,962
Did this make him a scholar?

871
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,166
Naturally,
it remained a horse.

872
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:42,436
(<i>laughter</i>)

873
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,171
And so with the peasant.

874
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:45,177
Surely, Colonel

875
00:49:45,246 --> 00:49:46,474
given a chance to learn...

876
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,538
You know, Monsieur Hornblower

877
00:49:48,616 --> 00:49:52,074
I think you are a revolutionary
at heart yourself.

878
00:49:52,153 --> 00:49:54,713
Indeed I am not, sir.

879
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:57,758
I began to suspect it in the
square this afternoon, actually.

880
00:49:57,825 --> 00:49:59,258
I take offense at that, sir.

881
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:03,194
But I tease you, of course.

882
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:06,893
But, monsieur, my country
is the farce you see today

883
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,562
precisely because certain
good souls, like yourself

884
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:13,732
believe they can teach
the peasant to think.

885
00:50:13,808 --> 00:50:19,303
Major Edrington, like myself,
you hold aristocratic title.

886
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,109
Surely you will support
me in this?

887
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:24,276
Colonel... you have
obviously given the matter

888
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:25,716
more thought than I.

889
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,117
However, you may be assured

890
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:29,918
that I thank God daily
for the good fortune of my birth

891
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,754
for I am certain I would have
made a miserable peasant.

892
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:36,024
(<i>quiet laughter</i>)

893
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:39,691
Mariette, <i>viens ici.</i>

894
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:40,825
<i>Viens.</i>

895
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:42,027
Take this woman.

896
00:50:42,102 --> 00:50:43,330
She is a peasant.

897
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:44,962
She works in my house

898
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:46,836
as her mother
did before her.

899
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,875
But in the days
of the republic

900
00:50:48,943 --> 00:50:50,433
they made her
a teacher.

901
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:53,537
Was this simple creature
put on this earth

902
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:55,138
to teach grammar,
huh?

903
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:57,684
It's much better
to leave her free

904
00:50:57,751 --> 00:50:59,616
to do what she
does best, huh?

905
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:00,949
<i>Je suis peut-etre</i>
<i>un payesan</i>

906
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:02,352
<i>mais je ne suis pas</i>
<i>an animal.</i>

907
00:51:02,423 --> 00:51:04,323
Ah, she says she
is not an animal.

908
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:06,951
There is no need
to translate her words, sir.

909
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:10,758
I understood her French, as she
clearly understood your English.

910
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:12,162
Have a care, Mr. Hornblower.

911
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,724
So it is self-evident, sir,
she cannot be as ignorant

912
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:16,360
as you are so anxious
to make her.

913
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:20,271
Once again, monsieur,
I hear the rebel in you.

914
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:25,301
Then you mistake yourself
again, sir, for I am no rebel.

915
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:26,710
I hope I am a gentleman

916
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,408
and that I will always treat
any woman with respect.

917
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:30,677
Enough!

918
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:31,718
<i>Allez!</i>

919
00:51:31,785 --> 00:51:33,116
I will not argue

920
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:36,679
with a common sailor
in the British navy.

921
00:51:36,757 --> 00:51:39,988
Before you slight a common
sailor, sir, may I remind you

922
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,585
that the British Navy
and its common sailors

923
00:51:42,663 --> 00:51:45,097
have conveyed
your grace's person thus far

924
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:47,963
without incident
or injury.

925
00:51:48,035 --> 00:51:50,162
Good night, gentlemen.

926
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:01,510
Now... where is our dessert?

927
00:52:01,582 --> 00:52:04,142
(<i>laughter</i>)

928
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:18,930
Ma'amselle...

929
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:21,797
I beg your pardon.

930
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:25,828
So, we are no more
than the animals.

931
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:29,307
I assure you, ma'amselle,
it is not a view I share

932
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:31,640
nor would wish
to hear expressed.

933
00:52:31,712 --> 00:52:34,579
You have been kind.

934
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,878
Once again,
you have tried to help me.

935
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,511
I did no more than
my conscience dictated.

936
00:52:39,587 --> 00:52:44,581
But now, I am afraid there is
nothing more you can do for me.

937
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:48,458
Ma'amselle...

938
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:50,087
at least allow me
to escort you home.

939
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:52,894
There is no need
to trouble yourself.

940
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,958
I assure you
it is no trouble.

941
00:52:57,338 --> 00:52:59,829
It would be
a pleasure.

942
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:01,135
Very well.

943
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,175
Thank you.

944
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:20,088
Today I think
there is only one lord
and master in France.

945
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,286
Ma'amselle?

946
00:53:21,362 --> 00:53:23,353
That machine.

947
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,059
For Moncoutant
or the Republicans,
it is the same.

948
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:30,501
Does he think he will
make us love him this way?

949
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,836
I am afraid I am not privy
to the colonel's plans.

950
00:53:33,907 --> 00:53:36,171
Then what are
you doing here?

951
00:53:36,243 --> 00:53:39,076
I'm here to do
my duty.

952
00:53:39,146 --> 00:53:41,512
And what is that,
your duty?

953
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:45,245
We will hold the bridge,
until we are told to leave.

954
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,914
Or until you are forced
to leave.

(<i>men laughing</i>)

957
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:03,895
So, the children have
an unexpected holiday.

958
00:54:03,971 --> 00:54:06,201
I'm sure once the colonel
is more settled...

959
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:09,538
For 20 years, I lived
like a dumb farm animal.

960
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,511
I have no desire to
live like that again.

961
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:13,511
Nor will you.

962
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,481
I will not
let it happen.

963
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:17,642
You have my word on it.

964
00:54:17,718 --> 00:54:22,018
I accept your
kindness, monsieur,
but not your word.

965
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,250
You do not know what
you are talking about.

966
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:26,224
Ma'amselle,
whilst I am here

967
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:28,784
you will come
to no harm,
I swear it.

968
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:30,159
And when you are gone?

969
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,095
You do not know me,
ma'amselle.

970
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:35,567
If you knew me,
you would not be
so quick to doubt me.

971
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:40,738
It is not you I doubt.

972
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:41,797
It is this place.

973
00:54:45,412 --> 00:54:47,004
I will protect you.

I do not think
they'll be back.

But at least allow me

984
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:29,581
to protect you
from them.

01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:40,259
Aye aye, sir.

1073
01:00:43,637 --> 01:00:45,502
Man:
<i>A mon signal!</i>

1074
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:46,539
<i>Feu!</i>

1075
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:51,807
(<i>shouting</i>)

1076
01:01:32,552 --> 01:01:34,349
Archie.

1077
01:01:34,421 --> 01:01:35,979
No sign of
their artillery?

1078
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:37,353
Not yet.

1079
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:42,160
I think I'll go to see
the major at the ford.

1080
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:44,688
Horatio?

1081
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,931
When they started shooting...

1082
01:01:50,003 --> 01:01:51,231
I panicked.

1083
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:53,704
I knew I was doing it,
but I couldn't stop myself.

1084
01:01:53,773 --> 01:01:55,673
It was the suddenness
of it, you see.

1085
01:01:55,742 --> 01:01:57,710
I think it was the same
for all of us.

1086
01:01:57,777 --> 01:01:59,972
But an officer...

1087
01:02:00,046 --> 01:02:02,913
even an acting lieutenant,
has no business to panic.

1088
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:05,417
Archie, you have nothing
to fear from the enemy.

1089
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:08,545
They mean to kill us, Horatio.

1090
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:10,613
Aye, of course they do.

1091
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:14,426
But their powder's
no threat to us.

1092
01:02:14,494 --> 01:02:18,726
From this distance,
they'd be hard pressed
to hit a barn door.

1093
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:20,265
If you can just stay calm

1094
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,358
and keep yourself
out of their sights

1095
01:02:22,435 --> 01:02:24,130
they cannot possibly touch you.

1096
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:29,542
All right.

1097
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,915
(<i>yelling</i>)

1098
01:02:41,988 --> 01:02:44,422
(<i>groans</i>)

1099
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:46,550
General!

1100
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:50,362
We are finished,
Mr. Bowles.

1101
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,397
Not yet, sir.

1102
01:02:51,464 --> 01:02:53,557
Save yourself if you can.

1103
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:56,659
This is not your country,
Mr. Bowles.

1104
01:02:56,736 --> 01:02:59,170
You should not
have to die here.

1105
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:30,258
Careful, Mr. Hornblower.

1106
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:33,033
We have a few wasps here
who are anxious to sting.

1107
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:34,767
So I see, my lord.

1108
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:37,105
Do you have any indication
of their number?

1109
01:03:37,177 --> 01:03:39,407
Hard to tell; they atter
their position constantly.

1110
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:40,912
It is the same
at the bridge.

1111
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:43,779
I have little time
for an enemy that
daren't show its face.

1112
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,045
What can they hope to
gain by such a display?

1113
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:48,383
Perhaps you should inform
Colonel Moncoutant.

1114
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:50,218
By all means,
if you can distract him

1115
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,985
from his concerns
at the village.

1116
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:54,959
Your own concerns
there last night...

1117
01:03:55,028 --> 01:03:57,588
I trust they
were concluded
satisfactorily?

1118
01:03:57,664 --> 01:04:01,395
Why... yes,
thank you, my lord.

1119
01:04:03,737 --> 01:04:06,069
I will talk
to the colonel.

1120
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:07,106
Mr. Hornblower?

1121
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:09,765
If you should speak to him

1122
01:04:09,843 --> 01:04:13,370
I think a little more diplomacy
wouldn't go amiss.

1123
01:04:13,446 --> 01:04:14,572
Yes, my lord.

1124
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,821
The shore party
have returned, sir.

1125
01:04:27,894 --> 01:04:29,657
Well, Mr. Bracegirdle?

1126
01:04:29,729 --> 01:04:31,424
They failed
to make contact

1127
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:33,432
with general
Charette's camp.

1128
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:42,674
It is as we suspected, then?

1129
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:46,075
All men are believed
lost, sir.

1130
01:04:48,615 --> 01:04:50,207
(<i>groans softly</i>)

1131
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:56,986
I stand before you a man
accused, Mr. Bracegirdle.

1132
01:04:57,057 --> 01:04:58,183
Accused, sir?

1133
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,088
By whom?

1134
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:00,558
By my own self.

1135
01:05:00,627 --> 01:05:01,594
I knew.

1136
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:07,261
I believed this campaign
was a forlorn hope

1137
01:05:07,334 --> 01:05:10,394
and yet I held my tongue.

1138
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:12,496
For what reason, sir?

1139
01:05:12,572 --> 01:05:14,199
I was ordered
to remain silent.

1140
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:18,304
Then the responsibility
does not lie with you, sir.

1141
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:20,278
It is with those
who gave the order.

1142
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:22,747
In principle, perhaps,
but what of...

1143
01:05:22,816 --> 01:05:24,374
conscience, Mr. Bracegirdle?

1144
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:26,749
And what of my order
to remain here?

1145
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,378
Must I also follow that?

1146
01:05:28,455 --> 01:05:30,821
For if I do, it is certain
more lives will be lost.

1147
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:35,227
Now that the republican forces
have defeated Charette

1148
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:38,696
surely they will turn
next to Muzillac.

1149
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:43,294
Do I disobey my order...

1150
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,598
or do I stay here

1151
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:47,037
and wait for the dead
to return?

1152
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:51,709
The mathematics of defeat.

1153
01:05:51,778 --> 01:05:53,507
Indeed.

1154
01:05:58,485 --> 01:06:03,013
A hateful equation...

1155
01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:04,681
and I do not have the answer.

1156
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:12,724
(<i>no voice</i>)

1157
01:06:18,772 --> 01:06:20,399
Yes, I got him.

1158
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:21,405
Up a bit.

1159
01:06:21,474 --> 01:06:22,498
There we go.

1160
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:23,803
A bit more.

1161
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:25,941
Let it go.

1162
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:30,316
Stand back.

1163
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:36,316
(<i>screaming</i>)

1164
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:39,191
Gotcha!

1165
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:41,659
Gotcha, you frog!

1166
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:43,396
(<i>chokes</i>)

1167
01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:49,734
Belay firing!

1168
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:51,100
Don't waste the powder.

1169
01:06:57,944 --> 01:07:00,276
Jean Fabier, you
have been found guitty

1170
01:07:00,346 --> 01:07:01,677
of sedition and treason

1171
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:03,477
and have been
sentenced to death

1172
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,381
by order
of the lord of Muzillac.

1173
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:07,386
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

1174
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:13,117
Woman:
<i>Non, non,</i>
<i>non, non, non!</i>

1175
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:14,820
<i>Non, non.</i>

1176
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:15,861
<i>Non.</i>

1177
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:21,259
Mr. Hornblower, should
you not be at the bridge?

1178
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:23,598
Colonel, the enemy continues
to put out sporadic fire.

1179
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,365
But there is no sign
of their artillery.

1180
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:26,871
Afraid to show themselves.

1181
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,601
Well, I would expect no more.

1182
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:30,199
Thank you, Mr. Hornblower.

1183
01:07:30,276 --> 01:07:31,174
Sir, may I suggest

1184
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,337
that you accompany me
back to the bridge?

1185
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:35,278
I have no doubt
we would all benefit

1186
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:37,077
from your assessment
of the enemy.

1187
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:39,618
Thank you for your invitation,
Mr. Hornblower

1188
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:43,019
but as you can see, I am
rather preoccupied at present.

1189
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:44,056
(<i>drum roll begins</i>)

1190
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:54,926
(<i>woman sobs</i>)

1191
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:58,493
Sir, I must strongly advise that
you come to the bridge at once.

1192
01:07:58,571 --> 01:07:59,503
The enemy, sir...

1193
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:00,504
Name?

1194
01:08:00,573 --> 01:08:02,404
What is this man's name?

1195
01:08:02,475 --> 01:08:03,942
Hornblower:
Sir, I cannot understand

1196
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:06,001
why you persist
with these executions

1197
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,946
when the enemy remains
at large and unaccounted for.

1198
01:08:09,015 --> 01:08:10,482
Enough, Mr. Hornblower.

1199
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,609
As you see, I have
business here in town.

1200
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:14,380
If you wish to scout
for the enemy

1201
01:08:14,454 --> 01:08:15,944
I will not prevent you.

1202
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:18,422
But I remind you,
I am your commanding officer

1203
01:08:18,491 --> 01:08:20,118
and in my experience,
it is proper

1204
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,820
to greet the absence
of an enemy

1205
01:08:21,895 --> 01:08:23,157
as good news.

1206
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:24,560
Good day, monsieur.

1207
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:25,598
Name?

1208
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:38,610
Prepare to set sail,
Mr. Bracegirdle

1209
01:08:38,678 --> 01:08:40,077
before we lose the wind.

1210
01:08:40,146 --> 01:08:42,171
For Muzillac, sir?

1211
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:44,682
Aye aye, sir.

1212
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:47,879
What of Mr. Bowles, sir?

1213
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:50,923
We must assume him lost
with the others.

1214
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:55,289
All hands to make sail!

1215
01:08:57,764 --> 01:09:02,792
(<i>speaking French</i>)

1216
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,117
(<i>groans</i>)

1217
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:39,604
(<i>men speaking French nearby</i>)

1218
01:09:56,689 --> 01:10:00,921
(<i>man yells in French</i>)

1219
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:11,066
So you want a fight then, eh?

1220
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:13,605
Is that what you want?

1221
01:10:13,673 --> 01:10:15,766
Keep your head
or you will lose it.

1222
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,173
Is that understood?

1223
01:10:17,243 --> 01:10:18,733
Do you understand,
Oldroyd?

1224
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:22,648
Good man.

1225
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:36,926
As idle as a painted ship
upon a painted ocean.

1226
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:38,793
Sir?

1227
01:10:38,865 --> 01:10:44,997
We have no wind,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

1228
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:47,198
We are becalmed.

1229
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,866
Call away the boats,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

1230
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:53,538
Call away the boats.

1231
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:03,981
S'arnt Major, form
a platoon of skirmishes

1232
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:05,319
to cross the river.

1233
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:07,655
It's time we smoked these
wasps out of their nest.

1234
01:11:07,727 --> 01:11:08,694
Yes, my lord.

1235
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:08,079
Platoon hatt!

1236
01:12:08,154 --> 01:12:10,384
Right face!

1237
01:12:19,799 --> 01:12:22,461
Rear rank, present.

1238
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:25,537
Rear rank, fire!

1239
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,622
(<i>softly</i>):
Artillery...

1240
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:52,394
Number one!

1241
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,094
Number two!

1242
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,475
Number three!

1243
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:34,801
How far have we come,
Mr. Bracegirdle?

1244
01:13:34,874 --> 01:13:36,501
Perhaps three
miles, sir.

1245
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:45,807
We'll get to Muzillac
if I have to row there myself.

1246
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:53,671
Platoon.

1247
01:13:53,742 --> 01:13:54,731
Attention!

1248
01:13:56,444 --> 01:13:57,502
How many, S'arnt Major?

1249
01:13:57,579 --> 01:13:59,342
18, sir.

1250
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:00,381
Eighteen?

1251
01:14:01,449 --> 01:14:02,677
Is that all?

1252
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:05,845
Then where in god's name
are the rest of them?

1253
01:14:07,055 --> 01:14:08,920
Man:
<i>Vive le roi.</i>

1254
01:14:14,629 --> 01:14:17,063
(<i>whispering</i>):
Mariette! It's me, Horatio.

1255
01:14:17,132 --> 01:14:19,123
(<i>man wailing</i>)

1256
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,792
<i>Viens.</i>

1257
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:28,104
(<i>drum roll outside</i>)

1258
01:14:28,176 --> 01:14:29,370
(<i>guillotine blade slices</i>)

1259
01:14:30,712 --> 01:14:32,771
<i>... Completement fou.</i>

1260
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:34,075
Have you not seen...

1261
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:37,141
have you not seen what is
happening in the square?

1262
01:14:37,218 --> 01:14:38,651
I needed to see you.

1263
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,915
Just now they
killed the baker.

1264
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:45,085
He is guitty of no more
than selling stale bread.

1265
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,287
Surely you can see how
dangerous Moncoutant is.

1266
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:49,922
He's still my
commanding officer.

1267
01:14:49,998 --> 01:14:52,523
As an officer,
you obey him.

1268
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,230
But as a man, you
know what he is,
do you not?

1269
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:03,738
Mariette, I have
to ask you something.

1270
01:15:05,747 --> 01:15:06,805
Before we came here

1271
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,644
did you see any
enemy soldiers

1272
01:15:08,716 --> 01:15:10,411
passing through
the village?

1273
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:13,784
Which enemy soldiers
did you have in mind?

1274
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,379
The Royalists
or the Republicans?

1275
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:16,788
Mariette, please.

1276
01:15:16,858 --> 01:15:18,223
No.

1277
01:15:18,293 --> 01:15:19,351
You come here

1278
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:21,486
knowing nothing
about me or this place.

1279
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:24,088
And you dare to ask me
to betray my own people.

1280
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:26,463
Your silence could mean
more bloodshed, not less.

1281
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:28,502
If you mean those butchers,
I am glad of it.

1282
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,935
It was not them
I was thinking of.

1283
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:31,130
If my men are
not prepared...

1284
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:34,539
You yourself could die.

1285
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:38,773
(<i>drum roll</i>)

1286
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:41,042
(<i>guillotine slices</i>)

1287
01:15:41,116 --> 01:15:44,017
The Republicans came,
three days ago.

1288
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:47,816
Now please go.

1289
01:15:47,889 --> 01:15:49,049
You cannot win here.

1290
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:51,684
Take your men and leave now

1291
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:53,750
while you still can.

1292
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:00,935
Horatio.

1293
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,307
I have lost too many people
without saying good-bye.

1294
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:26,119
I will come back
and take you away
from here

1295
01:16:26,194 --> 01:16:27,627
if that's what you want.

1296
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:39,232
Now go.

1297
01:16:46,681 --> 01:16:47,978
(<i>guillotine slices</i>)

1298
01:16:54,722 --> 01:16:55,950
(<i>yells</i>)

1299
01:17:03,998 --> 01:17:05,590
Bring forth the next man.

1300
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,628
(<i>villagers murmuring</i>)

1301
01:17:11,306 --> 01:17:12,273
Moncoutant:
Name?

1302
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,069
(<i>man mutters name</i>)

1303
01:17:14,142 --> 01:17:17,270
Moncoutant:
You have been found guitty
of sedition and treason

1304
01:17:17,345 --> 01:17:19,074
and have been sentenced
to death

1305
01:17:19,147 --> 01:17:20,876
by order
of the lord of Muzillac.

1306
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:21,938
<i>Vive le roi.</i>

1307
01:17:22,016 --> 01:17:23,483
(<i>men muttering in French</i>)

1308
01:17:34,596 --> 01:17:35,927
(<i>guillotine slices</i>)

1309
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,505
I knew we should have
went to the Indies.

1310
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:51,910
I told you before:
Yellow fever, typhoid.

1311
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,777
Much better off here, eh?

1312
01:17:56,884 --> 01:17:59,284
(<i>drum beating a march</i>)

1313
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:00,286
Sir.

1314
01:18:00,355 --> 01:18:04,189
Have a look at this.

1315
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:06,693
Look out for the lobsters.

1316
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:08,251
(<i>all chuckling</i>)

1317
01:18:10,031 --> 01:18:10,998
Oi, Oldroyd.

1318
01:18:28,483 --> 01:18:30,474
(<i>cheering</i>)

1319
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:43,459
I think we have been made
fools of, Mr. Hornblower.

1320
01:18:43,531 --> 01:18:46,432
There is no army here,
just a handful of frogs
making idle sport.

1321
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,026
I'm convinced the army
is massed to the north, my lord.

1322
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:50,365
We're facing the wrong way.

1323
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:51,735
Did you speak to the colonel
of this?

1324
01:18:51,806 --> 01:18:53,899
The colonel?

1325
01:18:53,975 --> 01:18:55,875
The village...
it's just butchery.

1326
01:18:55,943 --> 01:18:57,740
I see.

1327
01:18:57,812 --> 01:19:01,441
In that case, I suggest we look
to ourselves for command.

1328
01:19:01,516 --> 01:19:03,814
I think we have no choice,
my lord.

1329
01:19:08,856 --> 01:19:10,380
Pellew:
Come on, men!

1330
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:11,425
Pull!

1331
01:19:11,492 --> 01:19:12,959
(<i>men grunting, groaning</i>)

1332
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:17,623
Pull! Pull!

1333
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:19,929
Hey, hey!

1334
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:27,130
Pull!

1335
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:33,310
Pull! Pull!

1336
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:53,995
There.

1337
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,274
This expedition becomes
more ill-fated

1338
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:07,246
by the moment, Mr. Hornblower.

1339
01:20:20,561 --> 01:20:22,188
(<i>men yelling</i>)

1340
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:27,598
Quickly now, bring those in.

1341
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:35,201
I don't reckon they'll
be back in a hurry.

1342
01:20:35,276 --> 01:20:36,504
Better off
without them.

1343
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:45,976
My lord, it seems
the emigres have
had enough.

1344
01:20:46,053 --> 01:20:47,850
They may lack discipline,
Mr. Kennedy

1345
01:20:47,922 --> 01:20:49,321
but those men
are no cowards.

1346
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,221
They are going to defend
the village.

1347
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:52,554
Will it hold,
my lord?

1348
01:20:52,627 --> 01:20:54,060
It might,
for a while.

1349
01:20:54,128 --> 01:20:56,619
Mr. Hornblower is there now,
organizing their defenses.

1350
01:20:56,697 --> 01:20:58,187
But as the commanding
officer here

1351
01:20:58,266 --> 01:21:00,826
I think there is little more
we can do for these people.

1352
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:02,164
You wish to retreat?

1353
01:21:02,236 --> 01:21:05,069
I do, though it gives me
no pleasure to say it.

1354
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:07,539
We will take up
a defensive position
across the river.

1355
01:21:07,608 --> 01:21:09,200
Ready your men
to blow the bridge.

1356
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:09,971
At once, my lord.

1357
01:21:10,044 --> 01:21:10,976
Good.

1358
01:21:11,045 --> 01:21:12,637
What of Mr. Hornblower,
my lord?

1359
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:16,513
We will give him
as long as we can.

1360
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:17,516
Let us hope

1361
01:21:17,585 --> 01:21:19,519
he does not abandon
his customary caution.

1362
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:25,216
Bring it in!

1363
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:26,851
Quickly now!

1364
01:21:30,364 --> 01:21:33,094
(<i>man shouting orders</i>
<i>in French</i>)

1365
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,540

01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:47,374
<i>Non, laissez-moi!</i>

1368
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:48,415
Colonel!

1369
01:21:49,617 --> 01:21:50,641
Colonel!

1370
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:52,208
What?

1371
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:54,254
The enemy is massing
on the edge of town.

1372
01:21:54,322 --> 01:21:56,256
Your men, they need you, sir.

1373
01:21:58,459 --> 01:22:01,257
(<i>angrily</i>):
Very well.

1374
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:02,819
<i>Allons-y!</i>

1375
01:22:09,136 --> 01:22:10,865
<i>Bon.</i>

1376
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:15,732
Uh, do we take
the cannon, sir?

1377
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,038
No, it would
take too long.

1378
01:22:17,111 --> 01:22:18,703
We spike them
and then fall back.

1379
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:19,905
Aye aye, sir.

1380
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:22,711
Mr. Kennedy, sir,
what do we do

1381
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:23,943
if the frogs
get to the bridge?

1382
01:22:24,018 --> 01:22:26,077
You heard the major:
We blow it up.

1383
01:22:26,153 --> 01:22:27,142
Right, sir,
and then what?

1384
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:30,384
Then, Styles,
we withdraw to the beach

1385
01:22:30,458 --> 01:22:33,052
and, uh, we hope for the best.

1386
01:22:39,033 --> 01:22:40,933
(<i>drums beating</i>)

1387
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:04,958
(<i>yells</i>):
<i>Feu!</i>

1388
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:27,514
We've spiked
the guns, sir

1389
01:23:27,582 --> 01:23:30,050
and we've blown
the trunnions off
for good measure.

1390
01:23:30,117 --> 01:23:31,550
Well done, Matthews.

1391
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:33,211
Edrington:
Mr. Kennedy

1392
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:34,276
is the powder primed?

1393
01:23:34,355 --> 01:23:35,379
It is, sir.

1394
01:23:35,456 --> 01:23:37,651
Then lay the fuse, if you will.

1395
01:23:37,725 --> 01:23:39,989
Aye aye, sir.

1396
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:41,688
Lay the fuse.

(<i>shouting, screaming</i>)

1398
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:49,128
Colonel,
we must withdraw.

1399
01:23:49,203 --> 01:23:51,000
Moncoutant:
We need more men.

1400
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:53,040
Send for Major
Edrington's troops.

1401
01:23:53,107 --> 01:23:54,267
Colonel,
our cause is lost!

1402
01:23:54,342 --> 01:23:55,172
You must withdraw!

1403
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:57,904
I know you do not
like me, Mr. Hornblower

1404
01:23:57,979 --> 01:23:59,503
but this is my country.

1405
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,842
Your fight may
be over

1406
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:03,349
but mine cannot be
so quickly abandoned.

1407
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,351
I have left here
once already.

1408
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:06,909
I will not
leave again!

1409
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:18,394

1414
01:24:43,591 --> 01:24:45,525
we have a wind!

1415
01:24:45,593 --> 01:24:47,493
Lay on your oars!

(<i>sailors groaning,</i>

01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:04,930
Aye aye, sir.

1426
01:26:11,312 --> 01:26:14,770
I believe we are
of the same mind,
Mr. Kennedy.

1427
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:18,307
Perhaps we might
give it a few moments
more, my lord.

1428
01:26:18,385 --> 01:26:22,151
I daresay Mr. Hornblower
will surprise us yet.

1429
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:25,021
Aye, sir.

1430
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:26,059
If he is alive.

1431
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:27,526
(<i>mob yelling angrily</i>)

1432
01:26:27,595 --> 01:26:29,825
(<i>Moncoutant screaming</i>)

1433
01:26:53,554 --> 01:26:54,521
<i>Vite!</i>

1434
01:26:59,493 --> 01:27:01,757
You can climb down,
no one will see you.

1435
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,456
Do you suppose
for one minute

1436
01:27:03,531 --> 01:27:05,658
I would leave this
place without you?

1437
01:27:05,733 --> 01:27:07,098
Hurry!

1438
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:09,432
Come with me.

1439
01:27:09,503 --> 01:27:10,595
<i>C'est la folie.</i>

1440
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:12,138
I won't leave
without you.

1441
01:27:12,206 --> 01:27:14,231
(<i>banging on door</i>)

1442
01:27:14,308 --> 01:27:15,297
All right, go on.

1443
01:27:15,376 --> 01:27:16,434
Man:
<i>Ouvre la porte!</i>

1444
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:18,842
<i>Ouvre la porte!</i>

1445
01:27:18,913 --> 01:27:22,076
(<i>banging on door</i>)

1446
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:29,119
Come on!

1447
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,823
Jump!

1448
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:37,659
(<i>cries out</i>)

1449
01:27:37,731 --> 01:27:40,291
Ooh, <i>mon pied</i>!

1450
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:41,299
Are you all right?

1451
01:27:41,368 --> 01:27:42,300
<i>Ca va.</i>

1452
01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:43,427
Come on.

1453
01:27:43,504 --> 01:27:44,528
Let me help you.

1454
01:27:44,605 --> 01:27:45,697
One, two, three.

1455
01:27:52,847 --> 01:27:54,371
(<i>grunting</i>)

1456
01:27:57,718 --> 01:28:01,347
(<i>screaming</i>):
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

1457
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:05,790
(<i>wild cheering</i>)

1458
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:42,021
Styles:
Sir, we've not got
much time left.

1459
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:47,931
Let me do that, sir.

1460
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:25,036
(<i>scattered shooting;</i>
<i>men yelling</i>)

1461
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,647
Make ready!

1462
01:29:39,053 --> 01:29:39,985
Horatio.

1463
01:29:40,054 --> 01:29:41,043
Edrington:
Present!

1464
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:42,452
Hold your fire!

1465
01:29:48,195 --> 01:29:49,355
(<i>cries out</i>)

1466
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:53,559
Give covering fire.

1467
01:29:53,634 --> 01:29:55,101
Fire!

1468
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:04,267
(<i>sobbing wildly</i>)

1469
01:30:04,345 --> 01:30:05,972
(<i>howling</i>):
No!

1470
01:30:07,581 --> 01:30:09,708
Edrington:
Mr. Kennedy!

1471
01:30:09,783 --> 01:30:12,149
(<i>weeping</i>)

1472
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:16,246
Kennedy:
Horatio.

1473
01:30:18,859 --> 01:30:19,951
It's no good,
Horatio.

1474
01:30:20,027 --> 01:30:21,255
She's gone.

1475
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:23,922
Come on.
Come on.

1476
01:30:49,256 --> 01:30:51,986
Edrington:
Well, that should hold them
for a while, at least.

1477
01:30:52,059 --> 01:30:54,118
Mr. Kennedy, we will retreat
to the beach

1478
01:30:54,194 --> 01:30:55,684
and make our stand
from there.

1479
01:30:55,763 --> 01:30:56,821
Aye, my lord.

1480
01:30:56,897 --> 01:30:58,489
March the men off,
S'arnt Major.

1481
01:30:58,565 --> 01:30:59,725
Sergeant:
Shoulder arms!

1482
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,732
Mr. Kennedy.

1483
01:31:00,801 --> 01:31:02,894
Sergeant:
Left turn!

1484
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,062
Quick march!

1485
01:31:04,138 --> 01:31:07,073
Just look after him, will you?

1486
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:09,041
Of course.

1487
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:24,757
Come, Horatio.

1488
01:31:24,825 --> 01:31:26,793
You did
all you could.

1489
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:59,855
(<i>drums beating slow march</i>)

1490
01:32:23,117 --> 01:32:26,484
First company... hatt!

1491
01:32:26,553 --> 01:32:27,485
Styles:
Phew!

1492
01:32:27,554 --> 01:32:29,385
That's lovely, that is.

1493
01:32:29,456 --> 01:32:31,219
Oldroyd:
Well, take your pick:

1494
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:33,316
The devil or the deep blue sea.

1495
01:32:33,393 --> 01:32:34,951
Edrington:
S'arnt, form the men up.

1496
01:32:35,028 --> 01:32:36,256
Colors to the rear.

1497
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:38,389
Sergeant:
Very well, sir.

1498
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,425
Battalion will form line.

1499
01:32:42,503 --> 01:32:44,767
Five sections on the right.

1500
01:32:44,838 --> 01:32:46,100
Right way!

1501
01:32:46,173 --> 01:32:47,231
March!

1502
01:32:52,412 --> 01:32:54,937
I believe our old
friends are upon us.

1503
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:00,208
Bowles:
Ahoy!

1504
01:33:09,863 --> 01:33:12,331
One more step and
I'll see you in hell.

1505
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:13,866
Man:
Not that frog.

1506
01:33:13,934 --> 01:33:17,665
That frog is
a good frog.

1507
01:33:17,738 --> 01:33:19,535
Man:
Bowlesy!

1508
01:33:19,606 --> 01:33:21,403
(<i>men cheer</i>)

1509
01:33:21,475 --> 01:33:23,306
Man:
Good to see you.

1510
01:33:23,377 --> 01:33:24,309
Mr. Bowles.

1511
01:33:24,378 --> 01:33:25,606
(<i>chuckling</i>)

1512
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,241
I thought to see you
gentlemen in Paris by now.

1513
01:33:30,317 --> 01:33:33,150
Welcome back,
Mr. Bowles.

1514
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,312
Front rank, make ready!

1515
01:33:41,228 --> 01:33:42,923
Sergeant:
Front rank, kneel!

1516
01:33:49,236 --> 01:33:50,635
No one fancies
a swim then, eh?

1517
01:33:54,575 --> 01:33:56,406
Present!

1518
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,074
Fire!

1519
01:34:03,217 --> 01:34:05,048
(<i>men shouting, screaming</i>)

1520
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:10,919
Oldroyd:
It's the <i>Indy</i>!

1521
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:16,327
Atternate guns,
fire!

1522
01:34:18,932 --> 01:34:20,524
(<i>horse neighs</i>)

1523
01:34:34,248 --> 01:34:36,739
(<i>cheering</i>)

1524
01:34:40,387 --> 01:34:43,049
I think we are well done
with this place, Mr. Hornblower.

1525
01:34:46,193 --> 01:34:48,525
Aye, my lord.

1526
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:51,758
Well done, indeed.

1527
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:55,929
My lord.

1528
01:34:56,003 --> 01:34:57,231
Where's your coat, Mr. Bowles?

1529
01:34:57,304 --> 01:34:59,067
Welcome back,
Mr. Hornblower

1530
01:34:59,139 --> 01:35:00,367
Mr. Kennedy.

1531
01:35:04,945 --> 01:35:06,310
Mr. Hornblower!

1532
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,972
Your report in my cabin,
if you please.

1533
01:35:08,048 --> 01:35:08,844
Aye aye, sir.

1534
01:35:23,897 --> 01:35:26,832
Sir, I must report
the loss of six men

1535
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,801
and two cannon
from the ship's company.

1536
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:33,033
Not to mention
our French allies.

1537
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:36,141
Yes, sir.

1538
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:42,076
If a captain loses
his ship, Mr. Hornblower

1539
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:44,242
he must face a court-martial

1540
01:35:44,318 --> 01:35:47,378
whatever the circumstances
of his defeat.

1541
01:35:47,454 --> 01:35:48,386
Yes, sir.

1542
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:50,150
And he must defend himself

1543
01:35:50,223 --> 01:35:53,124
and his reputation,
do I make myself clear?

1544
01:35:53,193 --> 01:35:54,160
Yes, sir.

1545
01:35:57,531 --> 01:35:59,260
Well, man?

1546
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:01,062
Well?

1547
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:05,866
Sir, I have
nothing to say.

1548
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:10,873
The cannons were lost.

1549
01:36:10,944 --> 01:36:13,003
The men died.

1550
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:16,747
And the royalist
cause...

1551
01:36:21,922 --> 01:36:23,981
A failure then...

1552
01:36:24,057 --> 01:36:27,549
like the rest of this
miserable expedition

1553
01:36:27,627 --> 01:36:29,094
we've been engaged upon.

1554
01:36:29,162 --> 01:36:32,131
Yes, Mr. Hornblower.

1555
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:33,894
I include myself.

1556
01:36:42,509 --> 01:36:44,067
What were we
doing there, sir?

1557
01:36:48,648 --> 01:36:50,445
We were not wanted.

1558
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:58,381
We brought nothing but...

1559
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:02,189
destruction...

1560
01:37:02,262 --> 01:37:04,025
death...

1561
01:37:04,097 --> 01:37:05,962
and defeat.

1562
01:37:11,037 --> 01:37:14,302
Forgive me, sir.

1563
01:37:14,374 --> 01:37:16,342
It's all right,
Mr. Hornblower.

1564
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,207
It's all right.

1565
01:37:20,547 --> 01:37:22,014
Oh, come on, man,
look at you.

1566
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:23,481
Look at your new uniform.

1567
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:24,915
What a sorry state.

1568
01:37:24,985 --> 01:37:27,852
Hardly the image we've
come to expect, is it?

1569
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:30,651
Hmm?

1570
01:37:30,724 --> 01:37:31,713
No, sir.

1571
01:37:35,128 --> 01:37:37,460
When we put on this
uniform, Mr. Hornblower

1572
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:40,227
we entered into a life
of adventure and adversity

1573
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:44,396
but above all,
a life of duty.

1574
01:37:44,471 --> 01:37:48,874
A duty to our people,
our king, our country

1575
01:37:48,942 --> 01:37:51,775
but also,
a duty to our men.

1576
01:37:51,845 --> 01:37:54,541
We must always be

1577
01:37:54,614 --> 01:37:57,674
a source of inspiration
to them, Mr. Hornblower.

1578
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,844
And whatever
may befall us...

1579
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,320
whatever...

1580
01:38:02,389 --> 01:38:04,323
we must never forget

1581
01:38:04,391 --> 01:38:08,122
we are officers
in His Majesty's Navy.

1582
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:12,023
Indeed, sir.

1583
01:38:14,334 --> 01:38:16,427
I am glad to see you
safe, Mr. Hornblower.

1584
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,402
And I to be back, sir.
