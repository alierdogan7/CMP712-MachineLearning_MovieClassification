00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,889
THE SOIL OF BURMA IS RED,

15
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,537
AND SO ARE ITS ROCKS...

16
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:16,967
<i>The war ended long ago,</i>

17
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:23,706
<i>but it left indelibly</i>
<i>sad stories in our hearts.</i>

18
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,288
<i>What follows is one such story</i>

19
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,287
<i>that happened to our company.</i>

20
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,896
<i>It's a story</i>
<i>we shall never forget.</i>

21
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,732
<i>By July of 1945,</i>

22
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:44,462
<i>the tides of war had turned</i>
<i>against Japan even in Burma.</i>

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,588
<i>Our company retreated</i>
<i>from one mountain to the next.</i>

24
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,692
<i>We wanted to reach</i>
<i>the border somehow</i>

25
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,055
<i>and cross over into Thailand.</i>

26
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,091
Why don't we sing?

27
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:41,886
Singing is meant
for times like these.

28
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,164
Mizushima...

29
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,070
play your harp.

30
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:31,474
<i>A night in late autumn</i>

31
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:41,187
<i>The solitary traveler</i>

32
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:55,528
<i>Looks up at the sky</i>

33
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:05,376
<i>With a desolate heart</i>

34
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:19,820
<i>His beloved hometown</i>

35
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,066
<i>His parents dear</i>

36
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:41,844
<i>The path of his dreams</i>

37
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:47,609
<i>Is one that leads back home</i>

38
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:50,382
<i>We often sang.</i>

39
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:56,054
<i>Our captain had graduated</i>
<i>from music school</i>

40
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:59,722
<i>and eagerly taught us</i>
<i>the basics of choral singing.</i>

41
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:07,237
<i>Those songs lifted our spirits</i>
<i>in times of sorrow and pain.</i>

42
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:10,341
<i>In our company,</i>

43
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:15,107
<i>we had a special harp</i>
<i>fashioned after one used in Burma.</i>

44
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,882
<i>PFC Mizushima</i>
<i>learned how to play it.</i>

45
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:24,256
<i>He'd never studied music,</i>

46
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:28,155
<i>but he had a natural gift</i>
<i>and quickly mastered it.</i>

47
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,563
<i>He composed wonderful</i>
<i>accompaniments and variations</i>

48
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,395
<i>and played along as we sang.</i>

49
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:07,831
- Kobayashi, watch these.
- All right.

50
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:18,511
PFC Mizushima reporiting.
I'm leaving now to scout ahead.

51
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:22,479
- Thanks.
- I'll signal on the harp, as usual.

52
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:27,677
I'll play "Danger" if I see anything,
"All Clear" if it's okay to advance.

53
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:33,455
You look better like that
than in uniform.

54
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,687
He looks Burmese.

55
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:40,890
You should settle down here.
The natives would love you.

56
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,632
Me Burmese.

57
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,000
Burma nice country.

58
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,911
What's taking him so long?

59
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,152
Shall we send out
a second scout?

60
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:19,288
- The harp!
- Mizushima's playing the harp.

61
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,331
Which tune is it?

62
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:25,198
You still can't tell?
It's the "All Clear."

63
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:28,705
I always confuse them.

64
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,843
Sarge has a tin ear, huh?

65
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,545
Move out!

66
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,644
- What happened?
- Did a fox cast a spell on you?

67
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,873
- Some thieves cornered me.
- Thieves?

68
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,746
What did they take?

69
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:15,751
What could they take?
All he had on was a <i>longyi.</i>

70
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:19,722
- They took my <i>longyi!</i>
- And wrapped you in banana leaves?

71
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:23,954
They gave me these.
They had quite a few.

72
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,268
They held me up and asked me to
exchange the <i>longyi</i> for banana leaves.

73
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,597
What a polite holdup!

74
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:34,741
You look even better
in those leaves.

75
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:38,776
With a gold collar,
you'd look just like a cannibal.

76
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:43,549
A banana waist cloth
keeps you cool.

77
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,085
<i>Our greatest worry was food.</i>

78
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:55,660
<i>Enemy paratroopers</i>
<i>had laid traps in the villages,</i>

79
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,024
<i>so we couldn't afford</i>
<i>to be careless.</i>

80
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,734
Where's the village chief?

81
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:14,843
<i>Through distant clouds</i>
<i>the snows of the Himalayas glisten</i>

82
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,748
<i>We bathe ourselves</i>
<i>in its melted waters</i>

83
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:26,154
<i>Somewhere afar</i>
<i>your hidden spirit</i>

84
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,297
<i>Soothes with those waters</i>
<i>this burning heart</i>

85
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:39,539
Can you see the Himalayas?

86
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,904
Not from here.

87
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:48,204
The sutras and tradition tell us

88
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,483
that the Himalayas
are the home of the soul.

89
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:59,755
We long to see them,
even if just once.

90
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,345
Your playing has gotten
very good recently.

91
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,984
Not at all.

92
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:31,991
You should just settle here and play.
You've always said you love Burma.

93
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,223
I want to go home to Japan.

94
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,592
Japan...

95
00:12:55,416 --> 00:13:00,012
Your hospitality was quite unexpected.
We thank you.

96
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,123
We'll sing a song of gratitude.

97
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:09,988
"Setting Sail," first verse.

98
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,776
I knew it was
too good to be true.

99
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,966
- Stay put!
- The ammo boxes!

100
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,834
Nobody move.

101
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:54,200
Is it the British?

102
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:06,885
Sing! They're forming
a line in the woods.

103
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:12,883
We'll make them think
we don't know they're there.

104
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,584
Get ready for action
as we sing.

105
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:25,095
<i>Blossoms fall in my jade cup</i>

106
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:32,142
<i>The moon is reflected</i>
<i>in my sweet wine</i>

107
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:40,048
<i>Lost in thoughts</i>
<i>of peace and order</i>

108
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:46,693
<i>I look down</i>
<i>on the fields of glory</i>

109
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:53,594
<i>Rising toward the far hill</i>

110
00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:01,975
<i>Five stalwart youths</i>
<i>in high spirits</i>

111
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,078
Clap your hands!

112
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,146
Laugh!

113
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,355
They could attack
at any moment.

114
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,485
Night's falling.

115
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:23,595
We need to keep them off guard.
Laugh and clap your hands!

116
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,203
What about the ammo boxes?

117
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:34,431
One shot
and they'll all explode.

118
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:01,225
One shot and we'll be
blown to pieces.

119
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,794
O merciful Buddha...

120
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:29,946
False alarm.
They're not the enemy.

121
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,777
Wait!

122
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:34,576
Listen.
The song's in English.

123
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:36,094
<i>That night, we learned that the war</i>
<i>had ended three days earlier.</i>

124
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:40,072
<i>We gave up our arms.</i>

125
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,704
We have surrendered.

126
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:17,534
Not only us,

127
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:20,042
but our country as well.

128
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:24,846
I'm not sure
what to make of this.

129
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:31,355
We don't know where we'll be taken,
what we'll have to do,

130
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,992
or even if we'll be
allowed to live.

131
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:40,558
All of Japan has been
heavily bombed.

132
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:44,798
Many are dead.
Many are homeless and starving.

133
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,804
Our country is in ruins,

134
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:52,342
while we're imprisoned
thousands of miles away.

135
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,976
All we can do now
is watch and wait.

136
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:04,620
It's no use fighting our fate.

137
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,289
Far better to accept it like men

138
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:14,229
and wait for the day
when we can rise again as a nation.

139
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:20,573
Up until now,
we've lived and died together.

140
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:26,410
Now we must
share this fate together too.

141
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:33,177
If we die here in Burma,

142
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:36,017
we'll die together.

143
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:43,154
But if by chance
we're able to return home,

144
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,364
we'll do so together,
leaving no man behind.

145
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,167
We'll rebuild our country.

146
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:57,302
That's all I can say for now.

147
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:28,003
What's Mudon like?

148
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:31,171
So we're finally going
to the Mudon prison camp.

149
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:34,108
- Good thing, too!
- What's so good about it?

150
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:37,408
You think they'll kill us all?

151
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,580
Are you serious?

152
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:41,583
So what's Mudon like?

153
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:44,018
How should I know?

154
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:47,187
- Where's Mizushima?
- Here.

155
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,789
The captain's calling you.

156
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:55,997
A Japanese unit has been
holding out on a mountain.

157
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:01,196
The British have laid siege to it
for the past three days.

158
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:05,976
I've asked them
to let one of us go

159
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,740
and talk our men
into surrendering.

160
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:13,284
I don't want a single man
to die needlessly.

161
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,351
That's the mountain there.

162
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:25,222
What do you say?
Will you go?

163
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:28,663
It's a half day's trek by foot.

164
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,428
I'll go, sir.

165
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:36,131
I'm not sure what to do,
but I'll proceed as necessary.

166
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,037
Thank you.

167
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:42,041
The rest of us
will go south to Mudon.

168
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:45,542
Join us once you've completed
your mission.

169
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,511
It'll be tough to walk
the 200 miles to Mudon alone,

170
00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:52,351
but the British
have assured you safe passage.

171
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:57,160
I'll proceed to Mudon
once I've fulfilled my duty.

172
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:36,789
Very well. Persuade them to surrender.
But you only have 30 minutes.

173
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,487
We won't wait any longer.

174
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:14,900
What happened?
They suddenly stopped.

175
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:17,501
Must be having
their afternoon tea.

176
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:37,684
- Son of a bitch!
- Wait! He's Japanese!

177
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:32,772
- Careful!
- How'd you get here?

178
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,777
- Well done!
- Where'd you come from?

179
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,975
Where's your commander?

180
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:49,925
<i>Hey, what's this?</i>

181
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,462
<i>We can use every man</i>
<i>we can get at a time like this!</i>

182
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,292
<i>Stand at attention!</i>

183
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,403
I'm Mizushima from Inouye Company.
I'm here on a mission.

184
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,732
What? You're a messenger?

185
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:04,569
The Japanese army
has surrendered.

186
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:09,441
Furither resistance is useless.
Please surrender as quickly as -

187
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:12,516
Shut up!
How dare you!

188
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:15,552
Surrendering is an insult
to those who've died!

189
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:17,882
Unlike your unit,
we're not filthy cowards!

190
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:21,322
We'll fight to the death!
- What good are you then?

191
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,690
Live, endure, work
for your country!

192
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,626
For our country?

193
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,664
How dare you!

194
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,302
How does surrendering
help our country?

195
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,902
No one here wants to live
with that humiliation!

196
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,342
As long as nobody surrenders,
how can Japan lose?

197
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,279
That's right!

198
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:52,147
A coward like you
can't be Japanese.

199
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:53,985
Leave!
- I refuse!

200
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:58,130
Not until you reconsider.

201
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:01,129
You'll die if you stay.
Aren't you afraid?

202
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,461
I don't want to die
meaninglessly.

203
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:07,502
Dying in battle
is meaningless?

204
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:11,336
It doesn't serve Japan
or its people or yourself.

205
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:14,138
It's meaningless.
- How dare you!

206
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:19,450
- A harp? What's the big idea?
- I use it to signal.

207
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,813
Captain, you're responsible
for these men's lives.

208
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:29,586
If they die in vain,
the blame will be yours.

209
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:33,789
Who will apologize to their families
and to the people of Japan?

210
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:40,271
Very well.
I'll ask the men.

211
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:53,418
<i>- Nakai, what about you?</i>
<i>- I'll fight to the end, sir.</i>

212
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:55,382
<i>And the rest of you?</i>

213
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:58,456
How's it really gonna turn out?

214
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,785
Just as I said.

215
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,828
If only we had time
to discuss it calmly.

216
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,891
Unforitunately, time's almost up.

217
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,700
Please decide
in the next three minutes!

218
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:24,948
It's unanimous:
We'll fight to the death!

219
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:33,048
I'll ask the British

220
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,387
to give me more time.

221
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:38,826
- You're afraid of dying!
- Coward!

222
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:43,729
- I'm not a coward!
- Should we be taken prisoner?

223
00:32:43,936 --> 00:32:45,597
Go home alone!

224
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,706
Very well.

225
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,936
I don't have time
to argue with you.

226
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:06,785
What are you doing?

227
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,724
We'll never surrender!

228
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:24,309
My captain said not to let
a single man die needlessly!

229
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,346
You'll pay for this,
you son of a bitch!

230
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,651
MUDON

231
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,051
It's awful quiet.

232
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,662
Old lady, glad you made it!
And in the rain!

233
00:37:42,868 --> 00:37:45,393
It's her livelihood.

234
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:50,570
Old lady, let's trade.
What do you have today?

235
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:54,874
That stupid Indian soldier.

236
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,981
Firing blanks to scare me.

237
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,109
A raw recruit, I'll bet.

238
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,755
How can he not know my face?

239
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,522
How about a molasses bar
for this broom?

240
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,525
That's a broom?

241
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:13,996
I made it out of palm leaves.

242
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:18,128
You're a clever fellow.
Okay, it's a trade.

243
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,774
I made
this bamboo flute yesterday.

244
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:25,569
It sounds really nice.
Trade for some bananas?

245
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,712
Okay, trade.

246
00:38:27,913 --> 00:38:32,179
I don't want this monkey you gave me.
Can I trade it for food?

247
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:36,582
No, that's a naughty monkey.

248
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:38,882
I won't take it back.

249
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:42,322
I'll trade these new socks
for shrimp paste.

250
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,257
Okay, trade.

251
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:50,030
- Is that stuff good?
- Tastes like our salted fish guts.

252
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,797
Old lady...

253
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,533
did you ask about
what we discussed?

254
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,540
You forgot again, didn't you?
It's hopeless.

255
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:03,579
We can't get information.
We have to rely on you.

256
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:05,750
It's no use getting angry.

257
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:09,179
Please don't forget this time.

258
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:12,255
The wounded Japanese
brought to the Mudon hospital -

259
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,086
were they really captured
on Triangle Mountain?

260
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:20,061
And if so, was there
a man from another unit?

261
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:23,435
And is he okay?
Just ask that much.

262
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:29,505
I'm going to the hospital
in a few days for some trading.

263
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,437
I'll ask about it.

264
00:39:31,644 --> 00:39:34,135
- We'll pay what we can.
- Don't forget.

265
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:36,712
Don't forget, please!

266
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,383
I understand.

267
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:43,887
Thank you.
Good-bye.

268
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,716
She's kind,

269
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,689
but completely unreliable.

270
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:51,192
I wonder what happened to him.

271
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:53,262
It's been over ten days.

272
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:56,227
I should have gone myself.

273
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,906
<i>- Don't feed the monkey now.</i>
<i>- It's hungry.</i>

274
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:07,374
<i>That's the rice I saved.</i>
<i>I was going to feed it tomorrow.</i>

275
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,810
<i>What? Yesterday</i>
<i>you gave it my share!</i>

276
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:13,041
<i>- Go to sleep!</i>
<i>- I smell sake.</i>

277
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:15,220
Would you all shut up?

278
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:20,317
We haven't even begun to taste
the suffering of defeat yet.

279
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:27,989
We ought to be grateful
that we're just locked up here.

280
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:39,067
What do you say?

281
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:41,542
Let's starit
our rehearsals tomorrow.

282
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:47,080
<i>The shrike sings</i>
<i>on a withered branch</i>

283
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:51,150
<i>While we beat the straw</i>

284
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:57,719
Okada, take this.

285
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:05,067
<i>It's all as it was last year</i>

286
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:10,468
<i>But something is missing</i>

287
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,839
<i>The chop, chop, chop</i>
<i>of my brother's ax</i>

288
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:22,151
- They're singing with us.
- They come every day.

289
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,950
Sarge, you don't
sing so well, do you?

290
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:29,684
I'm probably
the worst in the unit.

291
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:33,626
- So you know you're bad?
- I guess.

292
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,632
That monk's here again.

293
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:46,004
People always give him offerings.
He rakes it in here.

294
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:27,780
Fall in!

295
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,079
Double file, forward!

296
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:03,381
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

297
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:07,183
- Kinda looks like Mizushima.
- Looks exactly like him!

298
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:09,724
Mizushima?

299
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,455
Mizushima!

300
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,698
Stop fooling around.
You'll scare him.

301
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:59,904
<i>Taking shelter from the rain?</i>

302
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,375
Hello, old lady!

303
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:05,015
What are you doing here?

304
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:10,280
This is my house.

305
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,582
So this is where you live!

306
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,491
Did you ask for us?

307
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:21,662
Yes, this time
I remembered to ask.

308
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,035
What happened to Mizushima?

309
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:26,033
Mizushima?

310
00:44:26,238 --> 00:44:29,674
I mean,
what did they tell you?

311
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,608
Calm down and I'll tell you
everything they told me.

312
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:38,540
You know the hospital,
the soldier -

313
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,514
Just give us the gist.
This squall's going to pass.

314
00:44:42,855 --> 00:44:49,055
They said they were
on Triangle Mountain.

315
00:44:53,031 --> 00:44:58,799
There was a man
from another unit.

316
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:05,670
They were all running around,
bullets flying everywhere,

317
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:11,682
so he probably died there.

318
00:45:11,884 --> 00:45:14,011
So he's dead after all.

319
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:16,346
He died in battle.

320
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:30,691
That's the same kind
that monk had.

321
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:35,465
Did you meet the monk too?

322
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:41,708
This is the brother
of the monk's bird.

323
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:47,978
My husband spent
all day yesterday in the woods

324
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:51,280
and caught five parrots.

325
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:57,929
The monk came along
and asked him for directions.

326
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,896
My husband gave him a parrot

327
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,091
to earn a favorable rebirith.

328
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,399
He sold three.
Only this one is left.

329
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,943
Old lady...

330
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,009
will you sell me that bird?

331
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:19,177
It's a very cute bird.

332
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:28,587
This is thanks
for all the information.

333
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:33,122
This is for you too.

334
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,626
Thank you.

335
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,162
Go ahead. Take the bird.

336
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:52,717
This bird can learn
Burmese, Japanese -

337
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:55,250
anything you want to teach it.

338
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,179
<i>That was the end</i>
<i>of our hopes for Mizushima.</i>

339
00:47:00,525 --> 00:47:03,392
<i>We couldn't learn any details.</i>

340
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:07,053
<i>We didn't even have a way</i>
<i>to search for his remains.</i>

341
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:11,466
<i>We could only believe</i>
<i>he had died in battle.</i>

342
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:35,579
It's been five days already.

343
00:48:37,656 --> 00:48:40,989
Can't you see
that whatever you do is futile?

344
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:45,027
The armies of Britain and Japan

345
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,563
can come and fight all they wish.

346
00:48:49,034 --> 00:48:51,764
