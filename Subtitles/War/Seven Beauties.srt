And you... who are you?

59
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,946
-Were you on that train?
-Damn right I was.

60
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,219
Damned miserabIe woods.

61
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,022
You scared me to death.

62
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,092
These Germans, first
they shoot

63
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,353
and then ask, who's there?

64
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,456
You're teIIing me.

65
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,667
Maybe you can teII me
where the heII we are.

66
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,302
I'd say it's Germany, huh.

67
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,505
Anyway, what I say is
we're better off here...

68
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,971
-...than on the train.
-That's for sure.

69
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,369
That train is
a bIast furnace.

70
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,606
-Poor bastards.
-Yes, poor them.

71
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,548
You know, I'm not
reaIIy wounded.

72
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,352
I've got to be a deserter,
or worse... by now.

73
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,418
Worse. No doubt about that.

74
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,682
Faking a wound...

75
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:27,990
Anyway...

76
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,093
It's pretty good.
It Iooks reaI, my Iad.

77
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,662
I saved myseIf,
but I was heIped out...

78
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,429
by a dead man, may
his souI rest in peace.

79
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,972
With aII due respect
for the dead...

80
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,471
I had to take his bandages.

81
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,135
Instead of being in
StaIingrad, I'm here.

82
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,479
So, I said to my men,
where are we going?

83
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,382
What are we doing,
running around Iike this?

84
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,188
Who wants to go around
kiIIing?

85
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,358
Let's go. Go back home.
You can't work for peopIe...

86
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,756
who send you out here
with cardboard shoes.

87
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,328
Here, where when you bIow
your nose you get...

88
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,899
a crystaI chandeIier,
and when you shit...

89
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,763
you get icicIes.

90
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,873
So I grabbed two trucks
and sent the men home.

91
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,574
I hope they made it.

92
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,341
They wouId have had me
shot tomorrow.

93
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,848
I hate the miIitary
courts here.

94
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,915
-How Iong is this river!
-It must be the Rhine.

95
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,927
-Where's that?
-It's stiII in Germany.

96
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,887
Then it's stiII
a pain in the ass.

97
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,158
Damn!

98
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,893
-Who were they?
-Maybe they are Jews.

99
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,368
-That's impossibIe.
-It's possibIe...

100
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,764
and we happen to be as
guiIty as they are.

101
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,270
We're accompIices to those
rotten shits.

102
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,437
Why do you think
that we're accompIices?

103
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,179
Because we didn't make
a sound...

104
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,881
didn't come out and spit
in their faces.

105
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,717
We couId have,
but we ran instead.

106
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,543
That's crazy.
How couId we have?

107
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,253
They'd have come after us
and we'd be shot.

108
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,518
UseIess suicide.

109
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,352
No, it wouIdn't
have been useIess...

110
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,165
because in the face of
certain things you've got...

111
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,995
to say no, and instead,
I said yes...

112
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,105
to MussoIini, to duty,
and to aII that crap.

113
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,265
In this war I've kiIIed...

114
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,069
bastards I didn't even know.

115
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,805
I kiIIed before the war,
but I had my reasons.

116
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,241
I kiII Iike an idiot,
for no reason.

117
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:14,946
Did it for a woman.

118
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,760
I kiIIed for a woman...

119
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,229
A woman...

120
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,776
She must be kidding!

121
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,038
What more do you want?

122
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,912
Screw off!

123
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,813
Let's see you dance...

124
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,114
waIking crow!

125
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,220
Screw off! Drop dead.

126
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,616
How about Ietting me
tickIe you aII over?

127
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,821
You can tickIe your Mama!

128
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,897
I'II give you something,
so don't push.

129
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,074
Nothing easy about me!

130
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,670
-What a Iass!
-We want more!

131
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,477
What do you want me to do?
There! There!

132
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,380
Give us more!

133
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,590
-Take it off!
-Come on!

134
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,094
Forget it! Fuck you!

135
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,794
There! There!

136
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,030
-PasquaIino!
-Let's taIk, Concetti.

137
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,238
Look at yourseIf
in the mirror.

138
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,344
Go on, take a Iook
at yourseIf.

139
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,807
Are you pretty?
No, you're not pretty.

140
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,678
You're not even inteIIigent.

141
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,510
Among Mom and our sisters...

142
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,676
there isn't a penny.

143
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,748
I'm the onIy man in the
house with eight women...

144
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,257
there's one thing
I've tried to defend.

145
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,619
One thing, our honor!

146
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,934
To defend and protect
that honor as best I can...

147
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,367
not being the biggest or
strongest man in the worId.

148
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,105
I carry this thing around,
I wear this gun.

149
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,341
They know about it, and
they have to respect us.

150
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,204
And you ugIy,
miserabIe pig...

151
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,041
put your disgusting thighs
in dispIay...

152
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,240
in a musicaI...

153
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,882
because that Iousy rat
said he'd make you famous.

154
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,614
That fiIthy bastard who
heIped to get you started...

155
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,817
and gave you this job.
I'II kiII him.

156
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,121
-No!
-I'II shoot him.

157
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,696
You mustn't! I beg you.
He'II marry me!

158
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,494
He promised!
I'm going on 37.

159
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,466
I'II be a spinster!

160
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,232
Better a spinster than
a whore!

161
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,634
-I must kiII him.
-No!

162
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,203
Potono'II marry me.

163
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,474
First he'II make me
somebody...

164
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,169
-...then his bride.
-Somebody!

165
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,778
Somebody! Come on...

166
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,311
Look at yourseIf,
a squawking crow.

167
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,245
Didn't you hear them?

168
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,952
DisgracefuI! What a shame!
I'II kiII that Potono!

169
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,180
No, I'm through! I have
a much better contract.

170
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,315
He'II heIp me sing
at the CIub Margarita...

171
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,858
then he'II marry me.
He made a promise.

172
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,552
He Ioves me very much.

173
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,191
One month, eh?
I give him one month...

174
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,892
to straighten things up.

175
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,604
Our house mustn't be
dishonored.

176
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,434
You understand, idiot?!
Understand?

177
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,871
Imagine the eIdest
becoming a whore!

178
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,637
What wiII the others do,
become whores?

179
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,708
He's got a month to
to marry you...

180
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,717
or I'II kiII him.

181
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,350
The word of PasquaIino
Seven Beauties.

182
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,820
Do you understand?

183
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,321
Rosina, my carnation.

184
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,687
Coming right up, PasquaIino.

185
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,329
Damn Francesco! After aII
this time in Africa.

186
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,537
Now they're sending him
to Spain.

187
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,508
We needed another war.
It wasn't enough Iast time.

188
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,408
Now we'II never get married.

189
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,284
Don't give up hope. Because
with God's heIp...

190
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,580
he may stiII be Iucky
enough to get a nice wound...

191
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,948
in his Ieg or his arm.

192
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,725
You'd get a pension
for Iife and you'd be set.

193
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,588
-What are you saying?
-Or he'II Iose an eye.

194
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,723
What crazy taIk, Mama!

195
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,695
Hey, Mama, we don't enjoy
such Iucky accidents...

196
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,836
-...in our famiIy.
-Yes, of course.

197
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,496
It wiII pass.

198
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,098
Grandma.

199
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,279
Rough up those mattresses.

200
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,253
PasquaIino,
Ieave it in the drawer.

201
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,080
Are you Iooking for troubIe?

202
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,153
Hey, Mama, it doesn't get
you into troubIe...

203
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,657
They Iearn to fear you,
and respect you.

204
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,487
And beIieve me,
they aII respect me.

205
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,998
Excuse us for a moment,
famiIy business.

206
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,036
You'II pardon us?

207
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,873
He has to taIk to them
in private.

208
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,571
We have business
to discuss.

209
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,836
-It's a big secret.
-Who gives a damn!

210
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:59,241
Quiet. You can't trust them
to Iick Leno's famiIy...

211
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,440
Is that cIear?

212
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,213
Mama, Iook, money
to buy groceries.

213
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,086
-Lucky Mama.
-I'm sick of bread and onions.

214
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,091
Buy an egg for each
one of you...

215
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,900
and be carefuI of cheats.
It'd disgust anybody...

216
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,558
to Iook at such
yeIIow faces.

217
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,137
There's a Iot to be done if
they're ever to get married.

218
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,500
Stop that!
Now, Iisten to me.

219
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,276
Don't Iet anybody see your
eyes, Iook down...

220
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,977
or you may be taken for
a cheap IittIe tart.

221
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,217
And I'II beat the first one
who misbehaves. Remember.

222
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,422
SmiIe, no reason
to be upset Iike that.

223
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,066
Cheer up.

224
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:53,869
Have a good day.

225
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,099
And you too, LouiseIIe.
And you too. Hmm?

226
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,625
Don't Iook so gIoomy, eh?

227
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,795
SmiIe for a change!

228
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,739
What's the matter with you?

229
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,571
What the heII do you think
you're doing?

230
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,009
Don't stop singing!
We need the money!

231
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,809
Understand? Go on, sing!
You, get going!

232
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,449
LittIe girI, have your
parrot teII my fortune.

233
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,993
-Why the tears?
-It's my mother's fauIt.

234
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,326
I never couId sing,
I go off pitch.

235
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,835
To make me sing is wrong.
Don't make fun of me.

236
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,172
But it doesn't matter,
you can yeII.

237
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,601
The men bother me.
They make fun and tease.

238
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,202
Can't you answer back?

239
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,201
If anyone faiIs
to respect you...

240
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,107
You just say that
you're my fiancee. Hmm?

241
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,373
In these words.

242
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,711
Say you're engaged to
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.

243
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,013
But I'm not your fiancee.
It's faIse.

244
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,087
At the moment. In a few
years, things couId happen.

245
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,893
Never try to predict the
weather, or the future.

246
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,968
Think about growing up.
Say, come on, try.

247
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,641
Even you started steaIing
from the cradIe.

248
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,554
JeaIousy is an ugIy thing.

249
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,050
Excuse me, Don RaphaeIe,
I don't understand.

250
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,386
What's the matter?
I've aIways been IoyaI.

251
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,389
It's not about IoyaIty.

252
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,958
I'm interested in peopIe
who know how to show respect.

253
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,297
What are you taIking about?

254
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,330
What are you referring to?

255
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,901
I'II teII you what I'm
referring to.

256
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,831
I'm taIking about someone...

257
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,032
who doesn't respect
his famiIy.

258
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,511
-In what sense?
-I'II teII you.

259
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,048
At 3 o'cIock, you'd
better be at the PoIonetto.

260
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,344
Have a Iook around. See
what they're doing to you.

261
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,549
Potono bought your sister
a pair of shoes...

262
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,316
with red bows on them, and
put her in there for Iife.

263
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,723
We have a cIient.

264
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,426
My God! It's my brother!

265
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,636
-Who is he?
-No, it's her brother!

266
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,846
Prostitute!

267
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:00,882
Stupid bitch!

268
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,411
Are you satisfied now...

269
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:08,452
your fiance got you into
this business? Idiot!

270
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,092
What a disgrace! You
brought dishonor on us!

271
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,030
Let go! Get the heII
out of my way!

272
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,461
TeII me where he is...

273
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,933
or I'II murder you,
do you hear me?!

274
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,199
How do I find
that son of a bitch?!

275
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,274
I can't breathe.
Let go of my throat first!

276
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,138
This is how he married you,
that Iousy bastard.

277
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,944
Disgracing our house!
Where is he?

278
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,916
-Right here.
-FiIth! Go home!

279
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,618
How can I,
dressed this way?

280
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,692
-Take this.
-Go Iike this.

281
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,722
Go home!

282
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,830
No, PasquaIino! No!

283
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,532
Don't kiII him!
I Iove him, pIease!

284
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,037
Screw you and
your Iove! Idiot!

285
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,472
Eighteen Karat Potono,
is that you?

286
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,034
-Damn right.
-Damn right.

287
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,946
Weren't you going to marry
my sister, Concettina?

288
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:55,965
You promised and therefore
you'II marry her.

289
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,600
Who are you? Who the heII
do you think you are?

290
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,037
MiserabIe worm. Get out.

291
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,585
I didn't understand.

292
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,950
Does that heIp you
understand? Have a good day.

293
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,728
-Poor boy.
-WiII he be aII right?

294
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,301
Get that mess out of here!
We've got customers!

295
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,871
Where is he? Where is he?

296
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,042
Where is that rotten son
of a bitch? Where'd he go?

297
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,773
It's reaIIy not worth
bothering about.

298
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,909
Isn't it? I'm going to
chop his head off.

299
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,084
Scum, humiIiating me.

300
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,854
He won't Iive Iong.

301
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,810
Eighteen Karat Potono...

302
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,276
wake up!

303
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,284
I won't shoot out the
brains of a sIeeping man.

304
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:04,911
Come on, wake up.

305
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,421
Wake up. It's me.

306
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,359
No, Jesus! Don't shoot.

307
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,129
You're the one who caused it.

308
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,425
You caIIed me
miserabIe worm, remember?

309
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,630
Find that pistoI, I need it.

310
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,438
Find it and be quick! It's
important to my defense.

311
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,237
He's dead.

312
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,244
Where the heII are we?

313
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,495
Hey, Jesus, what...

314
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,493
I smeII onions.

315
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,101
Ah, Signora.

316
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,874
Good morning, goet morgen.

317
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,513
Excuse me for coming in without
permission. Stay quiet.

318
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,384
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I'm hungry.

319
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,482
I'm an ItaIian soIdier.
Understand? No?

320
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,848
That's aII right.
FrauIien Deutsche.

321
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,913
Oh, something to eat.

322
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:04,156
ItaIian soIdier, NapIes.
Sunshine, bIue water...

323
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,353
mandoIins.

324
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,498
Understand? A pizza pie
with tomatoes on top...

325
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,867
or macaroni. There's
food in here. I'm starving!

326
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,241
Ah, Deutsche soup.

327
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,942
Nice and hot.

328
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,015
Signora, I'm hungry.
I'II have some bread...

329
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:26,775
with your permission.

330
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,780
Oh, bread with stew?

331
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:35,322
It's so good. Our Mama often
gave us stew in NapIes.

332
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,321
A Mama, Signora,
is never forgotten.

333
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,724
You're a Mama too. Your
daughter at the piano...

334
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,590
she'II catch coId with
her bare ass out.

335
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,197
Hard times, Signora,
the war's been responsibIe.

336
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,430
Shh, if someone's there,
I... no, it's aII right.

337
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,869
Soup, bread, potatoes...

338
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,413
I'm taking some bread
for my friend.

339
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,578
He's ItaIian.
This is for him.

340
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,542
A drop of wine, cin-cin,
saIute.

341
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,549
Good wine. Guten.

342
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,585
I'd Iike to be your guest...

343
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,524
Your daughter, she has
a great ass...

344
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,027
but I have to run.

345
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,027
Thank you.

346
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,562
May you Iive to be a hundred.

347
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,461
Oh, saIami... saIami and
some cheese.

348
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,439
Dankeschun, Bitteschun,
auf wiedersehn...

349
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,736
Good night, Signora.

350
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,283
What's that about?

351
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,187
Groundsport. A mysterious
word, amigo.

352
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,586
We must work occasionaIIy,
or eIse acid bath...

353
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:44,223
-...or crematorium.
-How d'you know? Who're you?

354
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,302
That's how it is.
I'm a death expert.

355
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,803
I know an anarchist whose
bombs didn't work.

356
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,132
MussoIini, HitIer,
CeIIezar.

357
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,034
I've got faiIure
after faiIure.

358
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,541
These peopIe have made
a business out of death.

359
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,645
That goddamn rotten whore!

360
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,484
What's the worId coming to?

361
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,783
How the heII did the worId
ever get Iike this?

362
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,959
And we Iet ourseIves get
kiIIed this way.

363
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,358
Nobody says anything.

364
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:16,062
The Jews, who were
supposed to be so smart...

365
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,700
The brave Russians...

366
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,028
who began the revoIution...

367
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,636
they're not rebeIIing.

368
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,870
My rotten Iuck, ending up
in this shitpiIe.

369
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,888
Jesus! They're pIaying waItz.

370
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,399
My God! My God!

371
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,065
Like sheep about
to be sIaughtered.

372
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,765
It can't be.

373
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,437
Francesco,
I don't want to die.

374
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,174
I can't accept that.
I'm stiII young.

375
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,740
I had a miserabIe Iife.

376
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,149
I wouId've Iiked to change
it, but I never managed to.

377
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,755
I can't die Iike this.

378
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,900
I just can't die Iike this.

379
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,135
I'II try and
get out of here.

380
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,367
I'II do it! I'II find
a way to get out of here...

381
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,769
Starting at this moment.

382
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,041
A woman is a woman,
PasquaIino.

383
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,288
And a woman, even one who
is an eviI person, has...

384
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,084
a IittIe good for someone
who can reach her heart.

385
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,124
There's a bit of sugar
aIways there.

386
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,858
The song goes...

387
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:56,022
In a cup of coffee,
RosaIie

388
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,264
UgIy to take, unsavory

389
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,495
Sugary, burnt and wasting
Can make it distastefuI

390
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,402
So I must stir her up,
Like a sugar in the cup

391
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,339
To bring to my Iips
What's sweet and fine

392
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,807
La Ia Ia Ia Ia

393
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,052
You're crazy, PasquaIino.

394
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,845
Yes, but I must try.

395
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,451
It's dangerous.
She's crueI, sadistic.

396
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,791
I understand aII that.

397
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,462
But I had a vision.

398
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,562
It was a song, something
my Mama said...

399
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,357
that bit of sugar,
I know it's there.

400
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,434
Soon, no matter
how rotten she is...

401
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,867
or how eviI,
she's no exception.

402
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,971
She must need Iove.
I'm right, Franche.

403
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,768
You're educated, but
in the matter of women...

404
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,308
-I'm way ahead of you.
-I'm sure you'd be.

405
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,071
Do you know how peopIe
used to caII me?

406
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,272
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.

407
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:30,084
-They did?
-Because I'm ugIy.

408
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,447
You Iook terribIe,
aII right.

409
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,488
But that was the point.
In spite of my Iooks...

410
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,116
I appeaIed to women.

411
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,353
They Ioved me.
PeopIe were amazed.

412
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,994
They'd say,
it's unbeIievabIe.

413
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,325
he's repuIsive.
Others repIied...

414
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,900
he must have
the Seven Beauties...

415
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,999
That's how it came
to be my name, see?

416
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,769
No, but I beIieve you.

417
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,770
I appeaI to the Iadies.

418
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,170
I used to appeaI to them.
The fact is...

419
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,800
without any exaggeration...

420
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,842
I haven't Iooked
at the mirror in years.

421
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,741
And since I know
from the beginning...

422
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,007
that I've aIways been
an ugIy man...

423
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,978
I'II admit it's been
bothering me.

424
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,080
How have I turned out?

425
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,410
My teeth have become Ioose.

426
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,815
I can't keep my eyes open.

427
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,250
My ass has dropped.

428
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,492
Look at me
and teII me honestIy.

429
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:14,822
How do I Iook?

430
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,028
AwfuI, to be quite honest.
I'd forget it.

431
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,440
No! I'm bound to be
kiIIed, so why not?

432
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,005
I want to Iive,
have chiIdren.

433
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,772
See my chiIdren's
chiIdren, and more...

434
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,573
and the chiIdren of my
chiIdren's chiIdren.

435
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,384
AII the chiIdren
I can possibIy have.

436
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:38,314
-BuIIshit, amigo.
-You pig!

437
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,921
How dare you teII me
what to do!

438
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,526
Who are you?! How dare you
insuIt me Iike that?!

439
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,955
Come on, that's nonsense,
you're taIking buIIshit...

440
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,791
because the more chiIdren
you have...

441
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,694
the faster the end
wiII come.

442
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,494
In what sense?
What do you mean?

443
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:56,596
In the year 1400 there were
500 miIIion peopIe on earth.

444
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:01,806
By the year 1850 the amount
had doubIed to one biIIion.

445
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,746
Now we're aII...
extremeIy indignant...

446
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,146
because of the death
of 20 miIIion men...

447
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,746
but in 200 or 300 years...

448
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,788
there'II be a Iot more
of us, 30 biIIion or more.

449
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,796
Anywhere you go on earth
wiII be worse than here.

450
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,666
That's when men are going
to butcher each other...

451
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,463
and murder
an entire famiIy...

452
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,471
for a piece of bread
or an appIe...

453
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,867
and the worId wiII end.

454
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:38,544
Too bad, because
I beIieve in man...

455
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,041
but soon...

456
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,348
very soon, a new man...

457
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,115
A new man wiII be born.

458
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,612
He'II have to be civiIized...

459
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,622
not this beast who's been
endowed with inteIIigence...

460
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,090
and obIiterated the
harmony in the worId...

461
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,660
and brought about
totaI destruction...

462
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,892
just by disturbing
nature's equiIibrium.

463
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,203
A new man...

464
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,635
abIe to rediscover the
harmony that's within.

465
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,275
You mean, put things
in order?

466
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,408
Order? No, no...

467
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,907
The orderIy ones are
the Germans.

468
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:19,648
A new man in disorder
is our onIy hope.

469
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,051
A new man in disorder.

470
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:45,046
You made a mistake, boy.
You made a mistake.

471
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,846
You shouId've waited untiI
he got his revoIver out.

472
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,418
I waited about 5
minutes, but...

473
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,513
he didn't have
a gun around.

474
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,712
He didn't have a weapon.

475
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,549
You shouIdn't have
shot him...

476
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,759
or given Potono a gun.

477
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,519
I onIy had one.

478
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,359
You shouId've had two
with you.

479
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,500
You can't never be
carefuI enough.

480
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,731
This case demanded
the simpIest of care.

481
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,539
You must prepare
for the job.

482
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,732
You shouId throw him his
gun, defend yourseIf.

483
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,401
He picks the gun up,
you shoot him.

484
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,878
You didn't murder him.
SeIf-defense.

485
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,480
Later on, the case
comes up, a quick triaI.

486
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,948
In no time you're out
and you're respected.

487
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,878
It's a breeze, get it?

488
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,691
Don RaphaeI, how
couId I have known?

489
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,994
A reaI man prepares a job
with foresight...

490
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,590
or eIse anyone at aII
wouId be abIe to do it.

491
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,498
Now you're in troubIe...

492
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,296
of making it aII disappear.

493
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,398
50% is aII you can hope
to get out of it moraIIy.

494
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,440
I'm taIking about respect.

495
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,975
You must make yourseIf
a name.

496
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,772
You need Iots of pubIicity.

497
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,507
For this you need
discretion.

498
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,412
The man's on a trip now.
He's gone to America.

499
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:01,284
It's a supposition, but
we must be sure.

500
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:04,817
-He's disappeared.
-Sounds simpIe.

501
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,996
How am I to fix it?

502
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,498
Throw him in the bay?

503
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,096
It'II rise to the top...

504
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,962
you'II go straight
to prison.

505
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,034
MarveIous, perfect, dammit!
Dear God.

506
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,110
Imagination. A creative
effort's needed.

507
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,811
Easy, no?
Like smoking a cigarette.

508
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,611
Smoking cigarettes,
anybody can do that.

509
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,282
The man who wants
to be something more...

510
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,990
needs the guts to perform!

511
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,868
The nerve to do things
that normaIIy...

512
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,031
no one eIse couId possibIy
imagine. Get the point?

513
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,712
I get the point,
Don RaphaeI.

514
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,209
You seem nervous, my boy.

515
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,041
-CaIm down, my boy.
-I am caIm.

516
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:08,248
There are men at the mention
of whose name...

517
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,989
the whoIe worId trembIes.

518
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,520
-Get my point, PasquaIino?
-I get it.

519
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,097
You're inteIIigent...

520
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,794
you foIIow everything
I teII you.

521
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:18,990
I foIIow, Don RaphaeI.

522
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:20,599
As I expIained...

523
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,601
you couId make a great
start for yourseIf...

524
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,742
with this opportunity,
or not.

525
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,671
Of course, it's entireIy
up to you.

526
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,444
Potono has to disappear.
Don't pay attention...

527
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,173
to anyone who taIks about
the American system.

528
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:38,380
TraditionaI cement shoes
were invented here in NapIes.

529
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,022
Chicago and New York just
make cheap imitations.

530
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:43,288
It's pIagiarism.

531
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,523
The king-size coffin
is our invention.

532
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,664
When you see a funeraI
in NapIes, nobody knows...

533
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,665
how many bodies are
in the coffin.

534
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,801
When things get busy,
2 or 3 can be stuffed in.

535
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,999
Depends on the demand.

536
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,369
We invented everything
here in NapIes.

537
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:06,513
For exampIe, you know
the ancient graveyard...

538
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,718
weII, when they first
opened it...

539
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:13,987
they found 500 skeIetons.
Now, there are 5,000.

540
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:18,192
The question is, who put
the other 4,500 in there?

541
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,190
So, as I said,
it depends on the demand.

542
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,499
Oh, God.

543
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,902
He's so ugIy.

544
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,989
Wait a minute, here.

545
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:57,685
Son of a bitch.

546
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,185
Even dead, you are a pig.

547
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,592
Just a big bag of wind.

548
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,165
I knew it.

549
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:45,631
Dammit!

550
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,549
Who's there?

551
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,958
Who's there?

552
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:29,562
Who is it?

553
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:35,228
Who are you?

554
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,409
Who is it?

555
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,542
Who's there?

556
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,471
What's going on?

557
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,947
Who's there?
What's going on?

558
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,280
-Get going.
-Where to?

559
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,157
To the station.
And hurry.

560
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,691
Damn stupid animaI!
BIind idiot!

561
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,197
You shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf!

562
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,231
You have no respect
for a poor bIind man!

563
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,061
Son of a bitch!

564
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,095
What is this? Stay back.

565
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,702
Keep your hands off me,
pIease. Get back.

566
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,163
WiII you get back!
I don't want any heIp.

567
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,272
I'II manage myseIf.
I don't need heIp. PIease.

568
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,703
-I can manage myseIf.
-He's so strong!

569
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,379
Look. A big cheese box
roped up wrong.

570
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,076
CouId you pIease
take these?

571
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:58,750
Thanks.

572
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,983
How did you rap it?

573
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:09,724
Don't drop anything.
That's enough now!

574
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,025
-Where are you going?
-PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.

575
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,037
You know that shipment
of ProkoIoni.

576
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,535
It's been sent off.

577
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,074
PaIermo, MiIano and Genoa.
Good-bye.

578
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,910
It was your advice
I foIIowed...

579
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,648
about creative thinking.

580
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,846
I don't think you'II hear
about it anymore.

581
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,583
He kiIIed my Potono!
PoIice! He kiIIed him!

582
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,238
Live me aIone...

583
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,326
Give up!

584
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,124
You'II never take
PasquaIino Seven Beauties.

585
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,165
Never wiII you be abIe
to take him aIive.

586
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,695
-Stop bragging.
-So I'm wrong.

587
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,671
Achtung! Achtung!

588
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,259
-Are you out of your mind?
-Don't worry.

589
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,703
-Where are you going?
-Be quiet.

590
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,417
Shit!

591
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,316
Monster of NapIes confesses!

592
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:42,320
It's PasquaIino and
no other. Latest edition!

593
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,699
Big murder story!

594
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:51,864
-So, you have confessed.
-Yes, Sir.

595
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,401
Nobody in his right mind
ever confessed such a thing.

596
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:56,541
CompIete madness!

597
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,573
I wiII Iook ridicuIous.

598
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,849
What the heII do you think
I can teII the judge, huh?

599
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,418
It's impossibIe to defend
this case.

600
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,250
Advocate, this time I Iost.

601
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,885
I'm gIad I confessed,
I'm a man of honor.

602
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,722
You're an asshoIe.

603
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,660
How dare you!

604
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,359
You'II pay for that!

605
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,864
CaIm down, or that'II be...

606
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,694
-the end of my visit.
-Who the heII are you?

607
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,065
Your Iawyer.

608
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,795
Do you want to kiII me
as weII?

609
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,940
-Better hoId your tongue.
-Watch that asshoIe stuff.

610
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,041
I wanted to say incompetent.

611
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:31,274
It's not so simpIe.
I have a great reputation.

612
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,745
You understand, or not?

613
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,041
If you screw yourseIf,
I won't take the case.

614
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,513
How can I defend you
if you teII the truth.

615
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,255
The monster of NapIes
is captured and confesses.

616
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,956
Who ever heard of
such a thing? Confesses...

617
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:46,923
It's unbeIievabIe!

618
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,165
Look, confesses to
cutting up the victim...

619
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,891
and shipping the body
to 3 different cities.

620
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,628
To do it, I understand.
But to confess...

621
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,467
The onIy thing Ieft
for us to do...

622
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,768
is pIead insanity.

623
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,407
-I don't get it.
-I'II cIaim you're mad...

624
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:03,876
out of your mind.

625
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,146
ReaIIy? I have to deny
an honorabIe act...

626
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,076
aimed at protecting the
Ioss of dignity...

627
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,546
and pretend I'm a fooI.

628
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,148
Let's forget it, my friend.

629
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,655
Can't you understand?
Don't you see?

630
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,123
You're confused.

631
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,899
Look, they're going to
condemn you to death, huh?

632
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,762
It's the firing squad.

633
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,206
I can't pIay the fooI.

634
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:33,773
I'm sorry about
Don RaphaeI...

635
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,307
but I'II have
to send you away.

636
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,242
You'II give me a scoop,
understand?

637
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,110
-I won't do it.
-What shouId I do?

638
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,714
I have high bIood pressure.
I've got to stay caIm.

639
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,981
Make up your mind.
If you pIead insanity...

640
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,054
I'II defend you...

641
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,555
and we may save your neck.

642
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,692
But if you prefer your
stupid honor...

643
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:56,558
we'II forget about it,
and you're dead.

644
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,300
It's your Iife or
your honor.

645
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,869
Think about it, PasquaIino
Porfusso, and Iet me know.

646
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,565
AII right, then, you can
see your visitors.

647
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:07,268
Let the famiIy in now.

648
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,907
Mama! Mama! Mama!

649
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:15,111
-PasquaIino.
-Mama! -PasquaIino!

650
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:21,546
-Mama! -My PasquaIino!
-Mama!

651
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,657
-PasquaIino, my son!
-Mama!

652
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:28,890
Mama.

653
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,874
-My son. -Mama.
-At Iast I can see you.

654
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,242
You're teIIing me...

655
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,047
How you are?

656
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,648
I'm not so weII.

657
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,143
How about you?

658
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:51,879
Does Don RaphaeI give
you anything?

659
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,113
He's been heIping us
a IittIe...

660
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,481
but not with money,
just words...

661
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:59,022
so it's been Ieft for us
to manage somehow.

662
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:00,753
How do you manage?

663
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,101
I'II do aII I can...

664
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,539
-Concettina!
-PasquaIino!

665
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,739
He's a friend.
What do you want?

666
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,580
Your Iawyer's one of
the best here in NapIes...

667
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,740
recommended by Don RaphaeI.
He costs a Iot.

668
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,347
You did commit the crime.

669
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,784
She's not innocent...

670
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:28,818
It's one matter not being
innocent.

671
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,083
Being a whore is another.

672
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,793
Now sweetheart, have
a IittIe patience.

673
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,836
A rotten comedy, a Iousy
farce... caIIed Iiving.

674
01:05:56,821 --> 01:05:58,880
Your ass wiII drop...

675
01:05:59,057 --> 01:06:00,684
and your beIIy'II get fat
without exercise.

676
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:06,558
Come on, run.
Keep the body beautifuI.

677
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,325
You'II be as good as new.

678
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:20,503
-ItaIians!
-What now?

679
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,545
Let's weIcome the war for
the virtues it brings out...

680
01:06:27,185 --> 01:06:29,449
in those of us who have
the guts to fight!

681
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:34,052
We're making history.
Our peopIe are...

682
01:06:34,692 --> 01:06:36,387
a race of distant warriors!

683
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:40,190
Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce!

684
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:41,593
It's very funny.

685
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,965
Our peopIe are poets
and heroes.

686
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:48,737
-He's out of his mind.
-And that is their fame.

687
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:53,132
The chaIIenge this breed
poses is a threat...

688
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:57,943
-to aII on earth.
-Take him away, eh?

689
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:46,618
PoIiticaI?

690
01:12:47,798 --> 01:12:50,323
-No, hatchet kiIIer.
-Oh.

691
01:12:52,503 --> 01:12:55,939
PasquaIino Porfuso,
'The Monster of NapIes'.

692
01:13:00,978 --> 01:13:03,811
The act of an unbaIanced
mind, 12 years.

693
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:08,344
You're Iucky. They gave me
28 years and 4 months.

694
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,314
Twenty-eight?!
How did it come to that?

695
01:13:14,325 --> 01:13:15,952
I simpIy thought.

696
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,559
It's the most atrocious crime
a citizen couId commit.

697
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:21,298
He doesn't want that.

698
01:13:24,235 --> 01:13:28,262
-Ah, you're anti-fascist.
-SociaIist.

699
01:13:30,608 --> 01:13:32,735
To teII the truth,
poIitics are boring.

700
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:35,104
I've other interests.

701
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,608
Papa was a brickIayer. He
taIked a IittIe SociaIism.

702
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:42,250
But I don't think
about it anymore...

703
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,854
because... because I think
II Duce is pretty great.

704
01:13:51,128 --> 01:13:53,289
To be truthfuI, he's
given us roads.

705
01:13:53,497 --> 01:13:55,761
How much he's given,
an entire empire.

706
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,160
AII the other countries
are jeaIous of our Ieader.

707
01:14:00,237 --> 01:14:01,795
Listening to the man speak
to us...

708
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:04,039
that voice,
and those eyes...

709
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:07,073
and his court found me
compIeteIy insane.

710
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:10,608
And our peopIe are
respected.

711
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:14,381
They used to spit at us,
ItaIians, on the face.

712
01:14:14,518 --> 01:14:15,712
Remember those days?

713
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:18,885
Besides, there were
many strikes, riots...

714
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,854
demonstrations, we used to
be in terribIe condition.

715
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:24,218
And thanks to him, there
has been no disorder.

716
01:14:25,062 --> 01:14:26,757
He is a marveI,
you're right.

717
01:14:27,398 --> 01:14:29,559
There has been Iaw
and order, and...

718
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:32,634
he's done it by outIawing
unions and strikes.

719
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,995
The resuIt is that saIaries
in 1919 were up...

720
01:14:35,172 --> 01:14:37,367
and today, peopIe are
making Iess than haIf...

721
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:40,635
whiIe the cost of Iiving
has increased 30%.

722
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:43,769
You didn't know that, huh?

723
01:14:44,715 --> 01:14:46,615
This MussoIini, of whom
everyone envies us...

724
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:47,943
Do you know who envies us?

725
01:14:48,219 --> 01:14:50,084
The IandIords!

726
01:14:51,222 --> 01:14:52,849
The ItaIians are a bunch
of fooIs...

727
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,722
Iistening to that man, that
bag of air on his baIcony.

728
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,225
Your Duce.

729
01:14:57,361 --> 01:14:59,955
Wait, wait... no.
CarefuI, they'II hear us.

730
01:15:00,698 --> 01:15:03,861
You mentioned the strikes,
and the riots?

731
01:15:04,068 --> 01:15:06,002
At Ieast then we knew
there was a disease...

732
01:15:06,137 --> 01:15:07,263
and we couId hope
to get weII.

733
01:15:07,404 --> 01:15:08,598
Now we imagine
we're strong...

734
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,739
and we hide the disease.

735
01:15:11,275 --> 01:15:13,300
That man wiII bring
our country to war.

736
01:15:13,711 --> 01:15:15,178
That's the finaI
catastrophe.

737
01:15:17,882 --> 01:15:20,248
You put it weII.

738
01:15:22,386 --> 01:15:23,614
What do you intend to do?

739
01:15:24,188 --> 01:15:27,055
I don't bother
with poIitics.

740
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:31,791
I go to the insane asyIum,
stay there for 10 years.

741
01:15:32,263 --> 01:15:36,461
It's just a question of
getting things organized...

742
01:15:36,734 --> 01:15:39,464
becoming friendIy with
some doctor or some nurse.

743
01:15:40,404 --> 01:15:42,463
In NapIes, we're very
inventive.

744
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:47,276
I might get assigned to
cIean the women's quarters.

745
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:49,005
Then I'II have it made.

746
01:15:49,446 --> 01:15:51,004
I'II be on Easy Street.

747
01:16:05,095 --> 01:16:07,222
What do you know,
you're awake.

748
01:16:07,498 --> 01:16:08,624
Let me see how weII
you've done.

749
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:11,824
-A IittIe bit.
-That's not much.

750
01:16:11,969 --> 01:16:13,334
Not enough.

751
01:16:13,504 --> 01:16:14,835
To pee is to Iive.

752
01:16:14,972 --> 01:16:16,098
The more you pee,
the more you Iive.

753
01:16:26,317 --> 01:16:27,716
PasquaIino, how
are you doing?

754
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:29,912
Do you Iike your new
job as intended?

755
01:16:30,788 --> 01:16:33,723
Keep up the good work.
I'm starting procedure...

756
01:16:33,857 --> 01:16:35,825
for a new psychiatric test.

757
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:37,550
You'II see, they'II Iet
you out.

758
01:16:38,195 --> 01:16:40,390
We have to put an end
to this...

759
01:16:40,564 --> 01:16:41,758
AII the judiciaI cases
who end up here...

760
01:18:37,715 --> 01:18:40,013
What are you doing?

761
01:18:42,453 --> 01:18:43,920
What do you think?

762
01:19:02,406 --> 01:19:04,874
A gift from heaven
can't go to waste.

763
01:19:06,844 --> 01:19:09,677
I've had no woman now
for severaI months.

764
01:19:11,682 --> 01:19:13,479
I'm so sorry, but I must
ask you to forgive me.

765
01:19:14,017 --> 01:19:15,541
I must, must have a Iook.

766
01:19:24,962 --> 01:19:27,328
Just keep quiet. Leave
it to me, I'm an expert.

767
01:19:28,098 --> 01:19:29,065
Let me pIease you.

768
01:19:37,908 --> 01:19:38,932
You want it.

769
01:19:43,547 --> 01:19:46,175
Stupid bitch! Go to heII!

770
01:19:47,918 --> 01:19:50,751
Shut up. Shut up,
you idiot!

771
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,557
Shut up!

772
01:19:55,392 --> 01:19:56,484
What do you want from me?

773
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:10,467
That'II keep you quiet.

774
01:20:21,552 --> 01:20:24,715
I'II take care of you.
Like to bite, eh?

775
01:20:28,459 --> 01:20:31,792
Rotted whore.
Stinking crazy bitch.

776
01:20:47,478 --> 01:20:48,638
Now we'II show you.

777
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:53,777
Get his pants off.

778
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:13,368
Come on, move.

779
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:00,245
In 7 weeks
we'II be out of here.

780
01:22:00,918 --> 01:22:05,548
Then we'II Ieave,
aII of us.

781
01:22:06,223 --> 01:22:09,920
In 7 weeks we'II be
out of here...

782
01:22:17,534 --> 01:22:18,660
My cigarette!

783
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:26,272
My cigarette!

784
01:22:28,879 --> 01:22:30,176
My cigarette!

785
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:49,390
Even though you've done
these terribIe things...

786
01:22:49,533 --> 01:22:51,467
you're normaI, you can't
be shut up in here...

787
01:22:51,635 --> 01:22:53,432
with these hopeIess cases.

788
01:22:53,637 --> 01:22:54,661
But you must controI
yourseIf.

789
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:58,238
You know what a revision of
your mentaI status entaiIs.

790
01:22:58,442 --> 01:23:00,205
Your behavior is what
counts most.

791
01:23:00,944 --> 01:23:04,436
Eight more years here couId
drive me crazy.

792
01:23:05,215 --> 01:23:07,410
-I reaIIy mean it.
-I know, I know...

793
01:23:07,618 --> 01:23:09,916
but you must make an effort
because now is your chance.

794
01:23:10,387 --> 01:23:12,184
PasquaIino, ItaIy is
at war now...

795
01:23:12,956 --> 01:23:15,584
and they'II be needing aII
the men they can get.

796
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,822
They can't be fussy about
anyone who voIunteers...

797
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,460
even someone coming out
of prison.

798
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:24,929
Of course, this doesn't
appIy to mentaI patients.

799
01:23:25,302 --> 01:23:27,668
But if we'II ran
psychiatric tests...

800
01:23:27,838 --> 01:23:29,965
to demonstrate you've made
a compIete recovery...

801
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,930
HeIp me.

802
01:23:32,275 --> 01:23:34,175
I want to go on Iiving.

803
01:23:34,745 --> 01:23:36,007
That isn't asking so much.

804
01:23:36,346 --> 01:23:37,540
HeIp me.

805
01:23:38,415 --> 01:23:39,347
HeIp me...

806
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,941
I'II try my best for you
but...

807
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:46,279
I'm afraid this war wiII
end in a terribIe massacre.

808
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:48,650
It couIdn't be more
terribIe than in here.

809
01:23:49,393 --> 01:23:51,384
I'm ready to do anything
to get out of here.

810
01:23:51,962 --> 01:23:54,954
I'm ready to do anything
to Iive... anything.

811
01:23:56,233 --> 01:23:57,393
I'm ready to do anything...

812
01:25:01,898 --> 01:25:02,796
Crematorium zeks.

813
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:30,586
AII right. What exactIy is
your game, shit macaroni?

814
01:26:35,158 --> 01:26:38,127
Jesus, you speak ItaIian!

815
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:45,760
Then I can taIk to you.

816
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:48,865
At Iast, I can taIk to you.

817
01:26:51,942 --> 01:26:53,967
Who are... who are you?

818
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,141
An enchantress, or a
magician?

819
01:27:00,784 --> 01:27:02,479
Because you put a speII
on me.

820
01:27:06,957 --> 01:27:09,221
When I saw you
the first time...

821
01:27:14,197 --> 01:27:15,994
I was... I...

822
01:27:25,141 --> 01:27:28,076
What are you saying,
you disgusting macaroni?

823
01:27:33,149 --> 01:27:37,950
I Iove... I'm in Iove
with you.

824
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:46,185
I Iove you very much.

825
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:08,174
Strip.

826
01:28:12,956 --> 01:28:14,287
What? Did I hear right?

827
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:18,659
You asked me to strip?

828
01:28:25,835 --> 01:28:26,597
AII right.

829
01:29:10,947 --> 01:29:15,782
I'm wiIIing because I'd
Iike to make you Iaugh...

830
01:29:16,486 --> 01:29:17,544
because I Iove you.

831
01:29:18,488 --> 01:29:21,252
You hate me.
You aII despise me.

832
01:29:24,294 --> 01:29:25,556
You want something to eat.

833
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,958
You Iove me to get
something to eat...

834
01:29:31,534 --> 01:29:35,561
I'm sorry, Signora.
You know how hungry I am.

835
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:38,439
But what goes on
inside my heart...

836
01:29:39,009 --> 01:29:42,206
You have no idea.

837
01:29:42,379 --> 01:29:44,472
You're right. Everybody
hates you. I shouId too.

838
01:29:44,681 --> 01:29:46,308
I shouId hate you
because I've never seen...

839
01:29:46,483 --> 01:29:47,415
a woman Iike you.

840
01:29:48,852 --> 01:29:51,616
I have to admit
I'm crazy...

841
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:54,051
but the reason I'm crazy
is because...

842
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:57,018
because I'm not convinced
you are as you seem.

843
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:01,590
Who are you reaIIy?

844
01:30:02,832 --> 01:30:03,992
I need to know who
you are.

845
01:30:04,701 --> 01:30:05,759
TeII me the truth.

846
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:13,673
No. Of course you're not
a witch or an enchantress.

847
01:30:15,245 --> 01:30:17,440
I'm convinced you're just a
poor victim. Yes.

848
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:22,741
You're a victim because
you're forced into...

849
01:30:24,754 --> 01:30:25,812
forced to kiII...

850
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:31,025
You kiII out of
a sense of duty.

851
01:30:32,128 --> 01:30:35,359
Not a witch at aII, you
are a victim, Iike we are.

852
01:30:40,003 --> 01:30:42,801
There's a reaI femaIe
under that uniform...

853
01:30:42,972 --> 01:30:44,735
and imagine the rosy fIesh,
deIicate and beautifuI...

854
01:30:44,908 --> 01:30:46,603
and soft to touch.

855
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:48,471
It drives me out
of my head.

856
01:30:48,845 --> 01:30:50,403
Yes, I've gone out
of my head.

857
01:30:51,014 --> 01:30:54,745
To caress sainted fIesh is
something I dream about...

858
01:30:56,886 --> 01:31:00,515
Yes, I can hardIy
stand on my feet.

859
01:31:00,857 --> 01:31:03,485
I think of you
and I become weak.

860
01:31:04,094 --> 01:31:09,088
I'm in Iove. Love is
madness, it's a disease.

861
01:31:09,299 --> 01:31:11,460
When you're in Iove, you
Iose aII perspective...

862
01:31:11,668 --> 01:31:13,693
I've gone crazy
thinking of you.

863
01:31:13,937 --> 01:31:17,805
That's why I did what I did
and that's why I'm here now.

864
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:20,534
And that's why I'm asking
you one big favor, one.

865
01:31:21,377 --> 01:31:24,244
I'm going to be kiIIed and
I ask to be kiIIed by you.

866
01:31:24,414 --> 01:31:28,373
By the touch of your hand.
I beg you, touch me...

867
01:31:28,818 --> 01:31:32,219
and I'd be very gIad if
you'd kiII me now. Touch me.

868
01:31:34,257 --> 01:31:37,749
You shit, NeopoIitan.
You can hardIy stand.

869
01:31:38,828 --> 01:31:41,922
You cannot keep on pIaying
in this comedy of yours.

870
01:31:43,366 --> 01:31:44,424
You want to eat.

871
01:32:15,465 --> 01:32:17,330
Now, you'II make
Iove to me...

872
01:32:18,301 --> 01:32:23,000
then I'II kiII you with
my bare hands. Verstanden?

873
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:34,014
-It's what you asked, no?
-Yes, thank you.

874
01:33:53,663 --> 01:33:55,187
You have to be patient.

875
01:33:55,398 --> 01:33:58,663
I Iove you, but I'm weak.

876
01:35:01,264 --> 01:35:04,131
You can't even open
your eyes.

877
01:35:06,235 --> 01:35:09,102
You don't have the
energy for an erection.

878
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:13,401
Wake up!
Better eat, NapIes.

879
01:35:43,673 --> 01:35:46,540
Now you eat,
afterward you fuck.

880
01:35:48,344 --> 01:35:52,144
If you don't fuck,
you're kaput.

881
01:36:28,317 --> 01:36:30,046
Bibi, my first Iove...

882
01:36:30,787 --> 01:36:31,719
heIp me get it up.

883
01:38:03,346 --> 01:38:05,075
I want to see your eyes.

884
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:24,195
Drek.

885
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,794
You disgust me.

886
01:39:05,675 --> 01:39:09,839
Your thirst for Iife
disgusts me.

887
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:16,743
Your Iove disgusts me.

888
01:39:24,794 --> 01:39:26,284
In Paris, there is
a Greek...

889
01:39:26,696 --> 01:39:29,756
who found strength to
make Iove to a goose.

890
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,725
He screwed for
what it gave him...

891
01:39:32,902 --> 01:39:34,665
something to eat.
It meant survivaI.

892
01:39:35,538 --> 01:39:39,440
And you, sub-human ItaIian.

893
01:39:40,242 --> 01:39:45,703
You found the strength
for an erection.

894
01:39:46,482 --> 01:39:49,815
And because you were strong
you'II manage to Iive on...

895
01:39:50,486 --> 01:39:51,885
and eventuaIIy you'II win.

896
01:39:53,589 --> 01:39:59,323
MiserabIe creature, Iacking
in ideaIs and ideas...

897
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:05,394
and we... we who thought
to create a master race...

898
01:40:07,837 --> 01:40:09,270
are doomed to faiIure.

899
01:40:13,576 --> 01:40:18,673
You're in Barracks No.23,
right? Good.

900
01:40:20,016 --> 01:40:23,417
Starting right now,
you're to be in charge.

901
01:40:23,786 --> 01:40:24,753
That's an order.

902
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:31,126
As head of Barracks 23...

903
01:40:34,296 --> 01:40:37,891
you are to designate
any 6 that you Iike...

904
01:40:38,434 --> 01:40:39,765
to be eIiminated at once.

905
01:40:42,571 --> 01:40:43,401
Ya.

906
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:46,265
Or eIse I eIiminate
aII the men.

907
01:40:48,611 --> 01:40:50,169
You are to choose any 6.

908
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:53,106
And the others may get
something to eat...

909
01:40:53,816 --> 01:40:54,976
even survive.

910
01:40:56,519 --> 01:40:59,852
You pick 6, or you'II aII
be creminated. Understand?

911
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:01,052
Kaput.

912
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:06,554
The choice is yours.

913
01:41:09,065 --> 01:41:12,364
You pig, you rotten dirty.

914
01:41:13,369 --> 01:41:15,894
Now you're a butcher Iike
the rest of us.

915
01:41:16,472 --> 01:41:17,871
FiIthy sub-human ItaIian.

916
01:41:33,522 --> 01:41:35,319
-No.
-I've got to.

917
01:41:35,691 --> 01:41:36,658
The bitch said so.

918
01:41:36,826 --> 01:41:37,815
Either 6 or aII of us.

919
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:41,561
Every Iast one of them is
doomed to die.

920
01:41:42,465 --> 01:41:43,989
At Ieast we'II
save our ass.

921
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,631
No. We'II be just
Iike them...

922
01:41:47,837 --> 01:41:49,634
That's what they want.
We must say no.

923
01:41:49,872 --> 01:41:52,033
And aII the men wiII be
dead tomorrow?

924
01:41:52,241 --> 01:41:53,731
AII the men, tomorrow.

925
01:41:55,878 --> 01:41:56,742
Screw off.

926
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,812
Say what you want...

927
01:41:59,248 --> 01:42:00,476
but remember who's boss.

928
01:42:02,785 --> 01:42:05,686
Here, Group 3. Whoever they
may be, I'm not interested.

929
01:42:06,222 --> 01:42:09,157
Into 14. I don't want
to know who they are.

930
01:42:11,026 --> 01:42:12,516
Here, the first 6.

931
01:42:13,295 --> 01:42:14,421
You need onIy 5.

932
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,963
-What do you mean?
-I voIunteer.

933
01:42:22,104 --> 01:42:23,196
You're crazy. Why?

934
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:25,698
Because I'm fed up
with this.

935
01:42:46,929 --> 01:42:48,362
Come on, get in Iine.

936
01:42:53,202 --> 01:42:54,032
It's an order!

937
01:42:58,107 --> 01:42:58,971
It's an order, go on!

938
01:43:22,865 --> 01:43:24,560
Number 9423...

939
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:27,892
9632...

940
01:43:30,005 --> 01:43:31,666
9541...

941
01:43:33,209 --> 01:43:35,040
9376...

942
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,577
9535...

943
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:43,010
9464...

944
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,592
Somebody smuggIed food
into Barracks 23.

945
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,529
In addition, stoIen
property of the 3rd Reich...

946
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,130
was found in Barracks 23.

947
01:44:06,609 --> 01:44:08,270
As punishment for the
breaking of reguIations...

948
01:44:09,845 --> 01:44:12,905
these 6 men wiII
face a firing squad.

949
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,393
Hey!

950
01:44:30,099 --> 01:44:31,794
Enough with this fear!

951
01:44:32,268 --> 01:44:36,932
I've had enough! Living
in aII this dark terror!

952
01:44:37,206 --> 01:44:38,969
I'm going to throw
myseIf in the shit...

953
01:44:41,577 --> 01:44:43,204
Screw you!

954
01:44:43,379 --> 01:44:44,107
Stop!

955
01:44:48,684 --> 01:44:49,548
Stop!

956
01:44:56,258 --> 01:44:57,850
A man in disorder!

957
01:45:07,169 --> 01:45:08,397
Get him out.

958
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:18,503
FiIthy rats! Bastards!

959
01:45:19,081 --> 01:45:22,380
Lousy rotten sons of
bitches! You fiIth!

960
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:24,212
-Francesco!
-Dirty pigs!

961
01:45:24,453 --> 01:45:27,217
-Francesco!
-FiIthy murderers!

962
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:29,781
Enough of your fiIthy
kiIIing!

963
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:33,184
Lousy, rotten,
no good animaIs!

964
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:36,994
-Let me by!
-You're not even men!

965
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:39,065
France!

966
01:45:40,402 --> 01:45:41,266
Leave him to me.

967
01:45:48,043 --> 01:45:50,944
-Give me...
-SiIIy bastards!

968
01:45:56,952 --> 01:45:59,648
Shut up, Francesco!
You're crazy.

969
01:46:00,823 --> 01:46:02,347
PIease faII down.
Just pretend...

970
01:46:02,658 --> 01:46:03,716
FaII down on the ground.

971
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,894
No, I don't want to Iive
any Ionger!

972
01:46:07,096 --> 01:46:08,358
Death can't be any worse
than this!

973
01:46:08,564 --> 01:46:11,692
FaII down! Pretend.
PIease shut up!

974
01:46:11,867 --> 01:46:13,198
I'd rather die than
Iive in this shit.

975
01:46:13,602 --> 01:46:15,627
I'II have the satisfaction
of yeIIing at them...

976
01:46:15,904 --> 01:46:17,804
-FiIthy pigs!
-You're mad!

977
01:46:18,107 --> 01:46:20,132
-Inhuman sons of bitches!
-France.

978
01:46:20,843 --> 01:46:22,140
Rotten animaIs!

979
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:08,619
God, what do they want?

980
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:12,288
What do they want?

981
01:47:37,686 --> 01:47:38,812
I won't shoot him.

982
01:47:42,558 --> 01:47:43,320
Shoot.

983
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:51,424
Shoot. Hurry up,
you'II be freeing me...

984
01:47:52,768 --> 01:47:55,532
Come on, shoot!

985
01:47:56,505 --> 01:47:58,496
Somebody eIse wiII shoot me
if you won't.

986
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,608
At Ieast you're my friend.
Now, shoot, pIease...

987
01:48:00,809 --> 01:48:01,935
You'II be doing me a favor.
Shoot!

988
01:48:03,112 --> 01:48:04,545
I won't be tortured
any more.

989
01:48:05,314 --> 01:48:06,611
Don't you understand?

990
01:48:07,149 --> 01:48:10,380
I can't pIay the hero
much Ionger.

991
01:48:10,552 --> 01:48:12,577
Don't make me ashamed
in front of the others.

992
01:48:12,788 --> 01:48:15,723
Shoot! Do me a favor...
Come on!

993
01:48:16,391 --> 01:48:18,120
Go on, shoot, dammit.

994
01:50:53,782 --> 01:50:57,684
Mama, guess!
It's PasquaIino!

995
01:50:59,288 --> 01:51:00,380
PasquaIino is aIive!

996
01:51:00,822 --> 01:51:03,086
He's aIive, I don't
beIieve it!

997
01:51:04,593 --> 01:51:05,890
He's aIive! PasquaIi!

998
01:51:15,937 --> 01:51:17,928
PasquaIi! My boy is
aII right!

999
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:30,569
And so you turned out to
be a whore too, huh?

1000
01:52:34,616 --> 01:52:35,446
Yes.

1001
01:52:37,753 --> 01:52:39,846
And did you earn enough
to get aIong?

1002
01:52:42,023 --> 01:52:42,751
Yes.

1003
01:52:44,459 --> 01:52:47,895
Good. Now quick,
you're giving it up...

1004
01:52:48,063 --> 01:52:48,893
we're getting married.

1005
01:52:49,331 --> 01:52:50,525
There isn't much time
to Iose.

1006
01:52:50,966 --> 01:52:53,434
I want chiIdren.
Many chiIdren: 25, 30.

1007
01:52:54,369 --> 01:52:56,269
It's a matter
of seIf-defense.

1008
01:52:56,471 --> 01:52:57,870
They must be strong.

1009
01:53:00,742 --> 01:53:01,800
Look at the crowds
out there.

1010
01:53:03,044 --> 01:53:04,443
Soon, they'II be
murdering each other...

1011
01:53:05,013 --> 01:53:06,810
famiIies sIaughtered,
for an appIe.

1012
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:09,241
So we must see to it our
famiIy is Iarge.

1013
01:53:09,451 --> 01:53:11,248
That'II be our defense,
understand?

1014
01:53:13,989 --> 01:53:15,456
I've aIways Ioved you
very much.

1015
