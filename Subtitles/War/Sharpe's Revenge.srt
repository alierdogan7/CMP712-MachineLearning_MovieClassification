1
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,270
Dépêchez-vous avec la malle.

2
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,310
Tenez mon cheval, voulez-vous?

3
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,670
(Coughing)

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,550
Merci, mon ami.

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,590
Mon général.

6
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,150
Réveille.

7
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,430
Richard, you're shaking.

8
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,990
Am I?

9
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,030
What's the matter?

10
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,070
(Sighs)

11
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,110
I'm going into battle today.

12
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,110
And I'm getting older.

13
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,110
You weren't old last night.

14
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,030
Where are we? It was dark when I arrived.

15
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,110
Behind that hill is the town of Toulouse.

16
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,710
Toulouse is the last town loyal to Napoleon.

17
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,110
If we take Toulouse,

18
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,630
Boney has to pack his bags and head for Paris.

19
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,150
And Paris will take everything that's valuable
and send him on his way.

20
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,190
You mean the war will be over?

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,430
If we take Toulouse.

22
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,430
And to take Toulouse,

23
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,470
we have to take that hill.

24
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,510
The war will be over!

25
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,510
We can go home,

26
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,550
buy a town house.

27
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,590
No, a country house.

28
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,270
Maybe both.

29
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,750
Both? And where do we get the money?

30
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,790
There's a lot of numbers here, Richard.

31
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,830
Let's see.

32
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,630
10,000 guineas.

33
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,870
And that piece of paper

34
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,110
gives you power of attorney over it all.

35
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,380
Which means you have complete control
over my money.

36
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,630
To do with it as you will.

37
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,830
You present that piece of paper at the premises

38
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,150
of Messrs Adam Hopkinson & Son,
Adelaide Street, London,

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,470
And they will give you 10.000 guineas.

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,590
You don't mean to die on me, Richard, do you?

41
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,950
Oh!

42
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,990
Dear Jane.

43
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,910
Richard?

44
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,030
If you love me enough
to leave me all your money,

45
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,580
you must love me enough
to make me a promise.

46
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,870
Do you?

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,710
It depends on the promise.

48
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,630
Promise this will be your last battle.

49
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,750
It bloody will be if I'm not careful.

50
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,350
Be serious, Richard.

51
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,830
Promise me that after this battle
you will ask Wellington to send you home.

52
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,110
Could do worse. I'm as tired
of these bloody battles as you are, Jane.

53
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,150
I want to go home.

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,750
Put my feet up.

55
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,630
We'll be so happy.

56
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,670
Yes,

57
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,710
we will.

58
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,150
Promise me you'll come straight back to me.

59
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,150
Break that promise, Richard,

60
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,910
and I promise
I'll be on the first boat back to England,

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,950
and you will never hear from me again.

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,950
I can't let that happen.

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,710
It would break my heart.

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,750
Would it?

65
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,350
Yes, it would.

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,190
You'd get all my money.

67
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,910
Colonel Ross?

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,950
SERGEANT MAJOR: Quiet in the ranks!

69
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,030
Oh, damn, damn, damn!

70
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,190
Five years I worked my fingers to the bone
for Wellington, cracking his codes and ciphers.

71
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,270
I beg him for a brigade, he gives me a brigade.

72
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,150
What am I to do with my brigade? I am
to support Colonel Wigram's brigade, Sharpe.

73
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,190
Colonel Wigram!

74
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,870
(Explosion)

75
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,550
Well, Ross?

76
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,630
Wellington wants you to take that hill,
and I hate you for it.

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,790
What are you grinning at, Sharpe?
Think I can't do it?

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,350
- What time is it, Ross?
- It's nine.

79
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,430
I shall be on top of that hill by noon.

80
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,710
- Sergeant major?
- Sir.

81
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,790
- Brigade will prepare to move off.
- Sir.

82
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,830
(Frederickson laughs)

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,990
Wigram's well connected, sir.

84
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,110
Wellington had to give him a chance.

85
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,150
You think he ain't up to it, Sharpe?

86
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,350
Why else would he send you in close support,
sir?

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,190
Did the communiqué say "close support",
Sharpe?

88
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,310
That's the way I read the order, sir.

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,390
Wellington wants you to give
very close support, sir.

90
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,860
Artillery! Covering fire.

91
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,070
SERGEANT MAJOR: Over here, lads.

92
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,430
On the double.

93
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,350
Come on,

94
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,420
be brave. Now.

95
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,540
SERGEANT MAJOR: Come over the top.

96
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,190
SERGEANT MAJOR: Come on.

97
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,110
Be firm now.

98
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,390
Sound the recall!

99
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,470
WIGRAM: Get back.

100
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,950
Guarding the Colors!

101
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,350
(Cheering)

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,950
Come on. Lads.

103
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,220
Let the buggers through.

104
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,310
I'll have you flogged! I'll have you flogged!

105
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,230
What are you staring at. Sharpe?
Bloody cowards ran away.

106
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,310
A bad workman always blames his tools.

107
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,510
Not my fault, Ross.

108
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,550
You did your best, Wigram.

109
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,110
Skirmishers!

110
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,670
Piper, play me a tune.

111
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,550
Général.

112
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,070
Distant bagpipes

113
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,430
(Knock at door)

114
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,910
Lady Spindacre to see you, ma'am.

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,950
(Sobs) Oh, Molly!

116
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,990
Oh, there, there!

117
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,030
You mustn't distress yourself.

118
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,950
He's in no danger, Jane.
Colonel Wigram is with him.

119
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,430
He's not worth the worry.

120
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,470
No soldier is.

121
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,510
What would I do without him?

122
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,630
I thought the same about my Reginald.

123
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,670
See, men are all the same.

124
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,790
You marry them,
you make a good home for them,

125
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,510
but as soon as your back is turned,
they're off to battle,

126
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,350
and before you can say Jack Robinson,
they're dead as doornails.

127
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,110
(Sighs)

128
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,150
My Reginald was no loss, though.

129
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,150
He didn't deserve me.

130
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,630
No. I married him a captain,
made him a major within a month,

131
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,670
and what does he do?

132
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,110
Gets himself killed by a common dragoon
at Vitoria.

133
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,630
(Gasps)

134
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,430
A wrinkle.

135
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,470
Well, it'll have to go.

136
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,710
Look at me, Jane.

137
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,750
Poor widow with a wrinkle.

138
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,870
Nothing except Colonel Wigram
between me and the poorhouse.

139
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,870
Or the whorehouse...

140
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,550
Why. What lovely notepaper.

141
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,950
JANE: That makes it worse.

142
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,350
Richard said if he was to fall in battle,

143
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,590
I was to take that paper to London,
and draw out his money.

144
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,590
It’s a power of attorney

145
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,630
Power of attorney?

146
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,230
Over a substantial sum?

147
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,470
10,000 guineas.

148
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,310
Richard, be careful!

149
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,110
See the breastworks?

150
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,990
Gunpowder'll weaken them.

151
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,110
See if you can get the grappling irons in.

152
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,750
Then open the gate

153
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,350
and let us into the fort.

154
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,000
Pint of rum for the first man
to get their grapnels in.

155
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,030
What do you say, Hobbes?

156
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,740
(Soldier screams)

157
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,710
Pint of rum, Hobbes!

158
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,510
WIGRAM: Close the ranks!

159
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,670
ROSS: Steady, lads. Steady, steady.

160
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,110
WIGRAM: Close the ranks!

161
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,270
Keep it tight, keep it tight!

162
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,110
Steady, boys.

163
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,430
Sharpe, open that gate.

164
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,110
Open the damn gate!

165
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,350
SERGEANT MAJOR: Everybody. Up the hill.

166
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,110
Come on, Hobbes!

167
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,350
I'll have that pint of rum for you, Hobbes.

168
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,350
Come on!

169
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,750
(Explosion)

170
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,790
We're in.

171
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,150
Steady. Close the ranks!

172
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,670
Ross

173
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,750
ROSS: Keep 'em moving, Wigram.
Keep the buggers moving!

174
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,790
Go on!

175
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,950
ROSS: Come on, you blighters!

176
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,390
Pick up the Colors!

177
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,430
Pick up the Colors!

178
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,140
What do you mean, coming on a battlefield
with your buttons not done up? Eh?

179
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,190
Come on. You follow me.

180
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,230
Follow me!

181
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,510
Go through.

182
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,910
Commandant Maillot!

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,950
Commandant.

184
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,870
You'll be needing this.

185
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,590
Get up. Get up!

186
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,510
Pick up your glasses.

187
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,790
Now crawl back to Calvet.

188
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,150
(Screams)

189
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,190
CALVET: Repliez-vous.

190
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,230
Repliez-vous.

191
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,190
Repliez-vous!

192
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,040
Stop firing. Cease firing!

193
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,110
Well done, lads.

194
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,150
See if you can find some brandy.

195
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,750
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Me, too.

196
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,110
- Pat?
- Sir?

197
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,430
- Tell Jane the battle's won.
- Yes, sir!

198
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,080
- I'm coming home.
ROSS: Splendid work. Sharpe.

199
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,190
- Are you all right, sir?
- Oh. It's a scratch.

200
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,470
Just a scratch. I intend to celebrate
tomorrow night with a good bottle of claret.

201
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,790
I want you to do me the honor
of dining with me.

202
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,180
Bring your beautiful wife. Sharpe.

203
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,230
Sir.

204
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,270
Oh,

205
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,820
you'd better bring that filly of yours, Wigram.

206
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,110
- What's her name?
- Lady Spindacre, sir.

207
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,710
The merry widow, yes.

208
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,590
Be sure and bring your wife, Sharpe.

209
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,510
Beauty...

210
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,510
...and the beast.

211
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,470
What did you say, sir?

212
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,630
Steady on, Sharpe. Just a jest.

213
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,150
Wigram merely meant
you're not as pretty as your wife.

214
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,670
Absolutely.

215
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,380
What I meant is that Sharpe
is not as well-bred as his wife.

216
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,180
Some women prefer the rough to the smooth.

217
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,740
They enjoy having themselves degraded.

218
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,510
Your next move, Sharpe,

219
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,190
is to slap my face.

220
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,070
(Clears throat) Who is to be your second, sir?

221
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,270
You're a damn fool, Sharpe. Wellington
hears about this, you'll be on the first ship home.

222
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,430
Exactly what I promised my wife, sir.

223
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,470
Best I stay here tonight.

224
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,830
Tell Jane you gave me some billet duties.

225
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,900
Very good.

226
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,950
(Gasps)

227
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,600
Pistols at dawn, sir.

228
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,870
(Groans)

229
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,030
Never mind, Sharpe.
That gives us 12 hours drinking. Come along.

230
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,750
(Laughter and music)

231
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,590
The spoils of war.

232
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,630
I've finished fighting, Frederickson.

233
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,790
WOMAN: Come on. Darling. Over 'ere. Eh?

234
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,790
I'm going home.

235
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,830
I feel the same.

236
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,830
I would like to be finished too.

237
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,230
But first, I must have what you have.

238
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,070
What's that?

239
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,110
Marriage and money.

240
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,390
Or money and marriage.

241
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,660
You have both, Sharpe.

242
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,710
Which comes first?

243
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,750
Luck.

244
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,790
Luck comes first.

245
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,830
I'm going to need more than luck.

246
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,430
The only way to make a beautiful woman
blind to all this

247
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,470
is to entice her with golden guineas.

248
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,510
Oh!

249
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,830
You don't need gold to entice them.
What did you do when you were young?

250
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,190
Dirty old sod!

251
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,590
See?

252
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,630
Getting old, Sharpe.

253
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,910
The old dazzler isn't what it used to be.

254
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,310
I need a good woman.
A woman who'll let me take my time.

255
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,350
Yeah.

256
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,910
I've got a woman like that.

257
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,950
And I mean to keep her.

258
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,630
That was why Toulouse was my last battle.

259
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,670
No.

260
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,990
Your last battle is in six hours' time,

261
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,790
with Colonel Wigram.

262
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,790
Merci.

263
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,830
(Sighs)

264
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,070
Le Général Calvet m'a dit
que c'étaient vos derniers jours parmi nous.

265
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,630
- Camier! Hoche!
- À vos ordres.

266
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,740
Challon...

267
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,790
(Knock at door)

268
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,790
- Lady Spindacre.
- Oh, Jane!

269
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,030
(Sighs)

270
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,070
Have I lost him?

271
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,110
Lost him?

272
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,150
All the others are returned.

273
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,190
Oh!

274
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,230
You weren't told?

275
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,670
Major Sharpe is well.

276
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,270
Oh, Molly!

277
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,070
And preparing to fight a duel.

278
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,350
A duel?

279
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,580
What happened?

280
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,110
Colonel Wigram made a gallant remark
about your beauty,

281
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,470
which Major Sharpe misunderstood,

282
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,510
and called Wigram out.

283
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,060
No!

284
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,350
He promised me.

285
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,390
He gave me his word!

286
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,350
And broke it. The brute!

287
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,110
What can I do?

288
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,350
Teach him a lesson.

289
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,350
You told him if he fought again,
you'd be on the next boat from Bordeaux.

290
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,310
Now, bad enough he should break his word.
Now, don't you break yours.

291
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,150
There's a ship sailing at three,

292
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,870
and we can be on it.

293
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,470
We?

294
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,310
Oh, my dear Jane, you're my best friend.

295
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,110
You don't think I'd let you down?

296
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,950
Now, pack your bags,
and your power of attorney,

297
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,150
and in three days from now, we'll be in London.

298
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,700
Oh, I don't know, Molly.

299
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,950
How can I leave Richard without a word?

300
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,990
You're not leaving him,

301
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,310
you're teaching him a lesson.

302
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,230
And while he's busy learning his lesson,

303
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,070
we'll be in Bond Street,
buying you some dresses

304
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,430
that'll break his heart when he sees you next.

305
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,390
(Whispers) My fellow likes to fire last.

306
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,950
Shoot, damn you. Shoot!

307
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,230
He likes them to sweat a little.

308
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,710
What if I was to say I was sorry, Sharpe?

309
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,470
ROSS: Don't shoot. Sharpe.

310
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,550
You won't want to shoot him.
Not when you hear my news.

311
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,590
- What news?
- The war's over.

312
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,430
Wellington's won. We've won, Sharpe.

313
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,110
God!

314
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,110
I hope what you said is true, Ross,

315
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,310
because if it's not,
I'll go back there and I'll shoot him in the head.

316
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,470
Might've been better
if he'd shot you in the head, Sharpe.

317
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,830
There's no point beating about the bush.
Your wife found out about the duel.

318
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,030
What?

319
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,550
Yes, she's leaving for Bordeaux,
taking a ship for England.

320
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,510
(Groaning)

321
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,550
Oh, stop your whining, Wigram!

322
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,710
You won't die from a bullet up the bum.

323
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,470
You might spend the rest of your life
scratching your arse,

324
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,710
but that's what we're all going to do now.

325
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,750
- Now this war is over.
- He shot me in the arse, Ross!

326
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,990
Don't go on, Wigram.

327
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,670
What the devil are you doing here?

328
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,540
Major Sharpe, this is a warrant
summoning you to a court of inquiry

329
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,790
under the joint jurisdiction
of the British and French authorities.

330
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,790
Oh, don't be a silly sod!
It wasn't much of a bloody duel.

331
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,070
It's nothing to do with dueling.

332
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,550
What the devil has it got to do with?

333
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,590
Last night,

334
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
ten miles outside Toulouse,

335
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,510
somebody stole a coach containing the treasure
of the former emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte.

336
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,550
Two men were killed.

337
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,910
So? What's it got to do with me?

338
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,430
Where were you last night?

339
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,150
I don't know. I was drunk. Blind drunk.
Like every other officer in the British army.

340
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,070
- He was with me.
- All night?

341
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,070
This is a sensitive issue. Sharpe.

342
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,990
Treasure worth more than
a million gold sovereigns.

343
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,430
Lord Wellington's French allies claim it's theirs,

344
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,190
And they have evidence you took it.

345
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,190
I’m sorry. Sharpe.

346
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,190
Am I under arrest?

347
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,270
Lord Wellington wants... proof,
so he's set up a tribunal of inquiry.

348
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,110
If it finds there is a case against you,
you go to a court martial.

349
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,350
If the court martial finds against you...

350
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,230
...you'll be shot.

351
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,390
Who's in charge of this tribunal?

352
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,510
Colonel Wigram.

353
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,110
(Groans)

354
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,350
You wish to withdraw all of it?

355
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,350
All of it.

356
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,390
10,000 guineas!

357
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,070
It's a very large sum, if I may say so, Mrs. Sharpe.

358
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,110
Are you sure that you want it all?

359
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,150
She's quite sure.

360
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,190
Very well.

361
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,790
If you will sign the bottom of the page.

362
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,270
How would you like to be paid
the sum specified?

363
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,870
Notes, coins, bonds. Makes no matter.

364
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,870
We'd like it in this bag.

365
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,870
Oh, no, no, no, no!

366
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,870
No. That's quite impossible.

367
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,500
We do not have such large sums
on the premises,

368
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,430
but it shall be with you by noon. Ma'am.

369
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,430
Please be sure it's sent over on time.

370
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,470
Carruthers has your address.

371
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm happy to have been of service to you,
Mrs. Sharpe.

372
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,390
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

373
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,830
- Carruthers?
- Yes. Sir?

374
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,830
Put a letter in the post to Major Sharpe.

375
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,950
Tell him his wife has closed the account.

376
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,990
(Gavel bangs)

377
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,190
The purpose of this tribunal
is to enquire into the disappearance

378
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,470
of the personal treasury
of the late emperor, Napoleon I,

379
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,470
whose property now belongs by law
to His Most Catholic Majesty,

380
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,830
Louis XVIII, King of France.

381
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,230
Monsieur Roland represents the interests
of the new French administration.

382
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,990
Major Sharpe,

383
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,550
as there appears to be a prima-facie case
against you as perpetrator of this crime.

384
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,790
You may wish to appoint a lawyer.

385
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,790
Just get on with it.

386
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
I shall speak for Major Sharpe, sir.

387
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,270
Don't be a damned fool.
What do you know about the law?

388
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,590
The court recognizes that Captain Frederickson
will hold a watching brief for Major Sharpe.

389
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,190
Proceed, Monsieur Roland.

390
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,230
In December last year,

391
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,670
the emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte,

392
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,540
was persuaded
to contemplate the possibility of defeat.

393
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,180
His private treasury was packed in wagons.

394
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,580
And a permanent escort provided

395
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,030
under a hand-picked officer,

396
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,070
Colonel Maillot.

397
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,390
Two weeks ago, after the fall of Toulouse,

398
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,710
this treasury fell under the overall command
of a new officer,

399
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,750
a Major Ducos.

400
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,790
Ducos

401
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,470
May I take a moment of your time,
Monsieur Roland?

402
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,310
Where is Major Ducos and Colonel Maillot
at this moment in time, sir?

403
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,070
Major Ducos is missing and presumed dead
at the hands of Major Sharpe.

404
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,790
Colonel Maillot is at his home in Normandy.

405
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,830
Why is Colonel Maillot not here?

406
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,270
He was not willing
to travel into British-held territory.

407
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,910
But he has sent me this sworn deposition.

408
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,910
The script, sir - why is it so shaky?

409
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,830
Colonel Maillot was wounded
in the attack on the train.

410
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,270
He lost two fingers on his right hand.

411
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,030
- Did you see him write it, sir?
- No.

412
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,470
But it tallies with the evidence at the scene.

413
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,710
I bend two fingers.

414
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,480
Tie a bandage about it.

415
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,580
Voilá.

416
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,630
Anyone could have written that statement.

417
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,350
If this tribunal of inquiry
finds against Major Sharpe,

418
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,430
he will be court-martialed for murder.

419
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,630
You cannot shoot a man
with no more evidence than a scrap of paper,

420
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,670
which looks as if a spider has crawled all over it.

421
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,030
Habeas corpus.

422
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,230
Produce the body.

423
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,510
I want to see Colonel Maillot in this court.

424
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,870
Habeas corpus?

425
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,230
A fellow in the field artillery
gave me a law book to wipe my arse with.

426
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,670
But I read it instead.

427
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,110
I think, Monsieur Roland, we must insist

428
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,740
on Colonel Maillot appearing before this tribunal.

429
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,300
I will fetch him here myself,

430
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,350
but it will take two weeks.

431
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,150
Just one last question.

432
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,910
Why should Major Sharpe,

433
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,350
a rich man, want to rob the treasury?

434
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,470
WIGRAM: He was a rich man.

435
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,910
Major Sharpe's wife withdrew all his money
from Messrs Adam Hopkinson & Son

436
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,460
in London a week ago.

437
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,310
And... er how do you know this?

438
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,630
We intercepted a letter
from Messrs Hopkinson & Son

439
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,350
to Major Sharpe.

440
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,550
WIGRAM: This tribunal is now adjourned.

441
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,670
Major Sharpe will be confined to quarters
in the barracks at Bordeaux.

442
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,550
(Groans)

443
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,220
Oh, Molly, I'm so glad you went back
and bought this.

444
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,350
I wanted it so much when we saw it yesterday,

445
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,390
but it seemed so expensive.

446
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,070
How much do I owe you?

447
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,910
Good grief, girl, it's a gift.

448
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,150
No, Molly, I insist.

449
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,430
Oh, well. Three guineas.

450
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,470
Hmm.

451
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,350
But you must stop me the next time.

452
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,740
My dear Jane, it's your money.

453
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,630
You must learn to spend it
without looking over your shoulder.

454
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,550
No, Molly, I must mind my money.

455
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,150
I'm glad your friend found me this town house.

456
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,110
I'm very happy with it, but the rent is very high,

457
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
and we're spending so much.

458
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,430
And besides. Richard will be here soon.

459
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,590
Major Sharpe?

460
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,590
But, Jane, how?

461
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,550
He's sure to follow me,
as soon as Wellington gives him leave.

462
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,030
(Knock at door)

463
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,070
Come.

464
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,870
A Lord Rossendale, ma'am, from Horse Guards.

465
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,520
He says he must see you most urgent.

466
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,550
Shall I tell him to wait?

467
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,590
No. Show him in, Sarah.

468
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,750
Mrs. Sharpe.

469
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,630
I'm sorry to intrude upon you, madam.

470
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,310
I would not have done so
were it not a most urgent matter.

471
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,100
I regret to say that your husband. Major Sharpe.
Has been arrested.

472
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,150
Arrested?

473
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,460
On what charge?

474
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,180
Making away with the treasure
of the late Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.

475
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,110
But my husband's a rich man.
Why should he do such a thing?

476
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,150
He's done worse, ma'am.

477
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,700
He murdered two men while taking it,
and mutilated...

478
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,670
Beg pardon. Ma'am. But it was bad.

479
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,870
He is in custody now,
and will most certainly be court-martialed.

480
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,670
Perhaps I should have broken the news
more gently?

481
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,390
Nonsense.
You were cruel to be kind, Lord Rossendale.

482
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,710
Major Sharpe has made her most miserable.

483
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,150
Brute!
Doesn't deserve a beautiful woman like this.

484
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,190
Shall I lay her on the couch?

485
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,230
No, take her to her bedroom.

486
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,550
- (Gasps) Don't let her drop.
- Don't worry, I have a good hold of her.

487
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,190
Smelling salts. Smelling salts, you stupid girl!

488
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,020
I shall have to leave you for a moment,
Lord Rossendale.

489
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,550
That girl will never find the smelling salts.

490
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,310
Be so good, Lord Rossendale,
as to take one of her hands and stroke it gently,

491
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,350
to restore the circulation of the blood.

492
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,590
Why, yes, of course.

493
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,750
She's taken every penny out of the account.

494
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,710
Why should she want it all?

495
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,510
Hats.

496
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,550
Hats cost a devil, I'm told.

497
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,710
Then she'd better buy a black one, with a veil.

498
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,190
They're going to shoot me, aren't they?

499
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,790
Yes, of course.

500
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,140
I've got to get out of here,
find this Maillot, find out the truth.

501
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,470
That's not a problem.

502
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,190
I gave the provosts a guinea

503
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,230
to get themselves some rum.

504
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,670
And human nature being what it is,

505
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,110
one little drop led to another little drop.

506
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,150
And...

507
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,350
(Clatter in other room)

508
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,390
After you, gentlemen.

509
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,870
DUCOS: Challon.

510
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,870
Romand, Hubert! Avec moi!

511
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,710
I can't understand it, Pat.

512
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,310
Why has she not written me
to tell me what's happening?

513
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,710
More than likely, she has written to you,
but how would a letter find us out here?

514
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,870
I want you to leave for England immediately.

515
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,110
I want you to give this letter to Jane personally.

516
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,950
Should I not know what's in it?

517
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,070
It says I'm sorry I broke my promise to her,
Patrick.

518
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,110
The rest of it's between a man and his wife.

519
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,550
I'll be back as soon as I can.

520
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,550
Where will I find you?

521
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,990
Maillot's place in Normandy.
It'll take me and Frederickson

522
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,390
a few weeks to get there.

523
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,830
Traveling mostly at night.

524
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,270
You'll find us.

525
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,870
Paris.

526
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,340
Paris!

527
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,310
SHARPE: Normandy. We're nearly there.

528
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,310
Get down!

529
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,110
Merde!

530
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,910
(Dogs bark)

531
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,430
Lucille?

532
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,830
Henri!

533
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,950
MAN’S VOICE: Major Sharpe, Major Sharpe!

534
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,190
Major Sharpe!

535
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,230
Henri!

536
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,230
Why not speak English, like the other night?

537
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,270
You're mistaken, ma'am.

538
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,590
We were not here the other night.

539
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,750
My name is Sharpe.

540
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,390
Major Sharpe.

541
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,230
Curse!

542
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,430
He let you live. Be sure I won't be so soft!

543
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,470
SHARPE: Help me!

544
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,510
Help him!

545
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,550
Get him on the table!

546
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,030
What did you use?

547
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,070
Nails. He shot my brother.

548
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,720
I assure you, Madame, he did not!

549
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,750
I heard his name called - Sharpe.

550
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,910
You were tricked. We were all tricked!

551
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,950
Boil some water, quickly!

552
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,510
Oh, cursed!

553
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,230
Escaped?

554
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,270
The provosts will pursue him.

555
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,820
What will happen when they find him?

556
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,150
Perhaps you should sit.

557
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,950
Oh, John,

558
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,560
what am I to do?

559
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,230
Hold on.

560
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,030
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

561
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,460
Hold him fast.

562
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,910
Argh!

563
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,430
Got it.

564
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,070
(Fizzing)

565
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,430
Help me dress the leg.

566
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,190
I'll do it.

567
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,020
Let him sleep now.

568
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,030
Madame, I don't even know your name.

569
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,510
Lucille Dubert.

570
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,830
I thought your name was Maillot.

571
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,750
No.

572
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,790
Madame Lucille Dubert.

573
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,550
You are very beautiful.

574
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,070
Are you married, Madame Dubert?

575
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,110
No, I’m a widow.

576
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,720
You British made me a widow on the battlefield.

577
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,350
At Talavera.

578
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,390
I'm sorry.

579
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,790
And er...

580
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,830
would you like to be married again?

581
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,070
Married! I hadn't thought of it.

582
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,830
When my husband died, I didn't think
I'd find happiness with another man.

583
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,350
And now?

584
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,030
No, maybe

585
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,030
I'm ready to think about it again.

586
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,910
That will be all, Rudge.

587
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,150
You may be off too, Sarah.

588
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,190
Thanks, ma'am.

589
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,350
To you.

590
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,350
Me?

591
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,870
To you.

592
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,350
You at least have a wonderful future, Jane.
You're a rich woman.

593
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,510
When I first saw you.

594
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,310
I thought
you were the most beautiful woman in London.

595
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,310
But wealthy too...
Society will open its arms to you.

596
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,350
What good is that to me?

597
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,350
I'm still his wife,

598
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,230
for better or for worse.

599
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,950
Believe me, Jane, it was for worse.

600
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,950
You are a wife now.

601
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,260
You will be a widow soon.

602
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,550
Don't say that.

603
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,150
I'm sorry, Jane. I'm stating a simple truth.

604
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,870
When they catch your husband.
They will shoot him.

605
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,870
Nothing you or I can do or say will stop that.

606
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,910
You must go.

607
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,560
You mustn't speak of my husband like that.

608
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,100
Major Sharpe has become a murderer, Jane.

609
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,150
He's not the man you married.

610
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,590
He's become a monster
who mutilates the men he murders.

611
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,630
Don't leave me!

612
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,190
I'm not leaving you, Jane.

613
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,150
Jane...

614
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,870
Major Sharpe is still the same.

615
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,950
He has a wife, hasn't he?

616
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,990
How do you know?

617
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,030
He called it out in his sleep.

618
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,070
Jane.

619
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,110
He must love her a lot.

620
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,150
Love her?

621
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,590
If he does, he's a fool.

622
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,990
(Clears throat)

623
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,990
She left him.

624
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,430
You have good sight.

625
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,430
Most men your age need spectacles.

626
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,470
Not me.

627
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,510
I'm not that old.

628
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,230
You're so vain.

629
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,110
You were wearing these
before you broke the glass.

630
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,110
These are not my spectacles.

631
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,470
They belong to a bad piece of work.

632
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,910
A French major by the name of Ducos.

633
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,110
Ducos?

634
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,470
You know the name?

635
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,710
My brother cursed his name. I remember.

636
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,750
Ducos has made Sharpe a thief.

637
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,750
And now he has made him a murderer.

638
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,070
We have to find him.

639
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,030
"Monsieur Juliot, Paris."

640
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,070
He made these.

641
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,540
Surely this Ducos would go back

642
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,590
to get another pair?

643
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,390
Look after Major Sharpe for me.

644
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,430
And when I get back,

645
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,630
I should have something to say to you.

646
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,670
Something to say to me?

647
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,380
And what do I say to Major Sharpe
when he wakes up and finds you've gone?

648
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,830
Tell him he is to be best man.

649
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,190
You will remember that? Au revoir.

650
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,430
Best man...

651
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,820
Good man, better man...

652
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,940
Best man...

653
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,830
Oh, merde!

654
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,110
Happy?

655
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,150
I love you.

656
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,950
I love my house. I love my life.

657
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,430
Miss Jane!

658
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,470
Harper!

659
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,310
Harper's here!

660
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,550
Jane!

661
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,990
I have a letter from your husband, Miss Jane.

662
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,950
Miss Jane...

663
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,990
Sarah!

664
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,510
Xavier?

665
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,630
You startled me, Major Sharpe.

666
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,110
How long have I been here, ma'am?

667
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,270
Ten days.

668
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,710
Have you been here every night?

669
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,750
Mm-hm.

670
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,790
Who is Xavier, ma'am?

671
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,390
My husband.

672
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,040
My late husband.

673
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,230
(Footsteps)

674
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,910
(Dog barks)

675
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,390
What are you doing in my house?

676
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,750
Who are you?

677
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,630
Apologies, Madame.

678
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,430
Major Salmon.

679
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,300
I'm here on the orders of the authorities,
searching for Major Sharpe.

680
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,390
I am alone.

681
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,190
We'd like to make sure of that, Madame.

682
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,230
He could be in hiding.

683
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,270
Major Salmon,

684
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,550
I am the mistress of this house.

685
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,870
I dust and clean every room

686
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,910
every day.

687
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,430
Do you think I wouldn't know
if there were a man hiding in my house?

688
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,980
If you say so. Madame Maillot.

689
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,030
We um...

690
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,590
came here because we were worried about you.

691
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,190
After all,

692
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,500
Major Sharpe...

693
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,310
...murdered your brother.

694
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,510
Then surely this is the last place

695
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,550
where he would hide.

696
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,790
Madame.

697
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,020
(Galloping)

698
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,110
Thank you.

699
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,310
You have a soft heart, but hard hands, ma'am.

700
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,830
Have you no servants?

701
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,150
What would I pay them with, Major Sharpe?

702
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,710
The Revolution took everything but the roof.

703
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,870
Napoleon took the rest,

704
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,990
including my brother... and my husband.

705
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,270
I'm sorry, ma'am.

706
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,310
I make do.

707
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,230
But there are certain tasks
that are too much for me.

708
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,230
It helps sometimes
to have a man about the house.

709
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,710
Captain Frederickson will help you
while we're here.

710
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,590
He has gone to Paris.

711
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,750
Paris?

712
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,550
He's gone to see the man
who makes Major Ducos' spectacles.

713
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,510
He said I should take care of you
until he comes back.

714
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,070
You're doing that very well, ma'am.

715
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,710
Did he say anything else?

716
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,750
Yes!

717
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,670
I think Captain Frederickson
asked me to marry him.

718
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,950
He's a fine man.

719
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,990
He's a hero.

720
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,030
Like you.

721
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,070
Like my husband.

722
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,190
Heroes have short lives.

723
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,750
What is the matter, dearest?

724
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,070
Look what the morning post just brought.

725
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,870
It's a letter from Richard.

726
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,830
I can't bear it, John.

727
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,390
He asks after my health most tenderly.

728
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,550
And then, almost as an afterthought,
tells me his troubles.

729
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,590
This is Sunday.

730
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,190
There is no post.

731
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,590
As I thought. I locked this door last night.

732
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,950
So how did the letter get into this room?

733
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,510
He's been here!

734
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,830
In our bedroom!

735
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,830
Harper was here.

736
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,270
(Running water)

737
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,820
Voilá.

738
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,710
- Monsieur?
- J'arrive.

739
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,950
Dans rue de Richelieu.

740
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,190
Gaston.

741
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,270
I make lenses for the world, monsieur.

742
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,030
I am Captain Frederickson.
I served with Wellington's army.

743
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,270
I too would have been a soldier,

744
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,920
but for my eyes.

745
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,670
But now the war is over, we are friends,
n'est-ce pas?

746
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,870
Just so. That is what brings me here.

747
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,910
During the war,
I was taken prisoner by a Major Ducos.

748
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,060
Ah.

749
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,030
These are his spectacles.

750
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,190
He had two pairs. One of which he loaned to me

751
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,230
while I was his prisoner.

752
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,270
Hmm...

753
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,310
Major Ducos?

754
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,990
You know him?

755
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,540
Perhaps you might tell me where I may find him.

756
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,150
I would like to thank him for his kindness to me.

757
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,230
I... I have not seen him for a... for a year.

758
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,270
It is strange.

759
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,710
These are very special prescriptions,
and only recently

760
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,870
a Count Poniatowski of Naples
ordered such a pair.

761
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,910
Exactement.

762
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,750
Count Poniatowski?

763
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,190
Of Naples.

764
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,990
Thank you, Monsieur Juliot.

765
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,630
Richard?

766
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,420
Are you hungry, Richard?

767
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,230
I'm starving.

768
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,990
What is your favorite French dish?

769
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,750
Er...

770
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,750
coq au vin.

771
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,550
Because it's the only one you know?

772
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,590
No,

773
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,710
I like it cos it's got wine in it.

774
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,310
It's got chicken in it too.

775
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,950
I'll get the wine, you get the chicken.

776
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,950
You will take us to Major Sharpe,

777
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,910
and Major Sharpe will take us to the treasure.

778
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,230
How the devil can he do that
when Ducos has it?

779
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,710
Convince me.

780
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,470
Do you think if Major Sharpe and myself
had the imperial treasure,

781
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,510
I would waste my time in a shop

782
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,550
that makes spectacles?

783
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,390
You are convincing me.

784
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,270
A toast.

785
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,310
What shall we drink to?

786
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,310
To the death of Napoleon.

787
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,310
Oh, you don't know?

788
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,350
But then, how could you?

789
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,390
Know what?

790
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,430
Napoleon is gone.

791
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,950
He's in exile in Elba.

792
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,070
I can't believe it.

793
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,270
Then the war...

794
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,830
...the war is truly over.

795
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,230
(Sighs) What shall I do?

796
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,830
You have to go home.

797
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,910
Until my innocence is proven, I have no home.

798
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,950
To peace, then.

799
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,070
To peace

800
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,830
(Sighs) Peace.

801
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,830
I've never known it before.

802
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,270
I seem to have spent all my life
soldiering, fighting.

803
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,390
Never really thinking about the war finishing,

804
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,860
and what I'd do, where I'd go.

805
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,070
These past few weeks,

806
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,110
being here with you,

807
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,760
helping on the farm, it's been good.

808
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,430
You've been very kind to me.

809
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,950
I feel like I'm...

810
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,990
Your wife will be waiting for you.

811
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,700
Yes, I suppose she will.

812
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,070
Good night, Richard.

813
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,390
Good night, ma'am.

814
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,910
(Sighs)

815
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,670
(Footsteps)

816
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,110
(Sighs)

817
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,990
Best I sleep in the barn, ma'am.

818
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,710
(Cowbells)

819
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,750
(Bleating)

820
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,700
Psst.

821
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,790
- It's me.
- Pat?

822
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,440
I've only just got back.

823
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,310
Let me have it, Pat. Let me have her letter.

824
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,750
Jeez, I looked everywhere for her, so I did.

825
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,550
Damn it, let me have her letter, Pat!

826
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,670
There is no letter.

827
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,950
When found her she didn't want to see me...

828
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,190
Where is she?

829
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,470
She's in London.

830
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,870
She's well. She's staying with her friend,
Lady Molly something or other.

831
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,790
- Who else?
- They're being looked after by Lord Rossendale.

832
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,870
We, he'll be a friend off Lady Molly's...

833
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,670
Tell me the truth, Pat...

834
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,190
Is my wife...

835
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,430
Is Lord Rossendale... Damn it! Are they lovers?

836
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,190
Yes or no?

837
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,390
No.

838
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,430
Good God, no.

839
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,030
Nothing like that. Sir. Nothing.

840
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,070
You're a damn poor liar.

841
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,990
But you're a damn good friend, Patrick Harper.

842
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,790
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

843
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,310
The door was hocked.

844
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,630
MAN: Dans le jardin d'mon père,
les lilas ont fleuri

845
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,230
Dans le jardin d'mon père

846
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,670
Les lilas ont fleuri

847
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,710
Tous les oiseaux du monde

848
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,750
Viennent y faire leur nids

849
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,310
GROUP: Auprès de ma blonde,
qu'il fait bon, fait bon, fait bon

850
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,270
Auprès de ma blonde, qu'il fait bon dormir

851
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,790
Auprès de ma blonde

852
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,390
Qu'il fait bon, fait bon, fait bon

853
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,100
Auprès de ma blonde, qu'il fait bon dormir

854
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,310
(All cheer)

855
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,870
What do you say to my plan?

856
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,910
We join forces, go to Naples,

857
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,390
and destroy Ducos?

858
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,430
Just like that?

859
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,790
We cross the frontier into a foreign country,

860
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,630
and fight Ducos
and the devil knows how many men?

861
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,990
I only wish to recover the treasure.

862
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,350
You. However,
need to save yourself from execution.

863
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,350
You have no choice.

864
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,630
Who's in command of this expedition?

865
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,190
How many generals do you see in the room?

866
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,230
None. Calvet.

867
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,270
It's like the French Revolution.

868
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,990
All men are equal, each man on his own merit.

869
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,030
We have the most merit.

870
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,500
- So you say.
- H do say.

871
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,470
What you need in Naples are skirmishers,
snipers, small-arms experts.

872
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,220
We've three such experts -
me, Captain Frederickson

873
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,270
And Sergeant Harper.

874
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:05,480
So, which one of you equals is in command?

875
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,550
- I am.
- What do you say to that, Captain Frederickson?

876
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,030
Major Sharpe is in command, General.

877
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,550
CALVET: How shall I divide the cheese?

878
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,990
By merit or by rank?
Who gets the biggest piece?

879
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,830
- You do.
- Because I am a general.

880
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,870
No, because bloody hate cheese

881
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,790
(Sighs)

882
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,660
Can I have a few words with you, Frederickson?

883
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,710
Official business, Major Sharpe?

884
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,750
Private business,

885
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,790
between me and you.

886
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,830
Save your breath.

887
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,590
For God's sake, Frederickson!
We've been friends for five years.

888
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,790
We were friends. That's all over now.

889
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,830
So, if you'll excuse me, sir...

890
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,270
For God's sake!
You think I set out to get myself shot?

891
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,790
Didn't you?

892
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,670
No, I didn't! I stepped into her sights.

893
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,990
Damn you, Sharpe! God damn you!

894
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,030
How many women do you want?

895
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,070
- William...
- I hope she breaks your bloody heart.

896
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,990
I will come back.

897
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,990
I'll be here.

898
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,430
Lady Molly Spindacre, ma'am.

899
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,590
Oh, Molly, I'm so glad to see you!

900
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,870
I got your letter. I came straight here.

901
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,260
Damn expensive journey,
I don't mind telling you.

902
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,820
- I'll make it up to you, I promise.
- Don't mention it.

903
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,870
What are friends for?

904
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,630
Now, tell me what's the matter.

905
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,070
Molly,

906
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,110
I'm so frightened!

907
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,150
Richard has escaped,

908
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,310
and is footloose somewhere in France,

909
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,350
sending his men to attack me!

910
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,110
We must leave England.

911
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,310
Leave England? For where?

912
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,350
America.

913
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,390
John has helped me invest my money there,
in cotton

914
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,710
And shaves.

915
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,550
We need money.

916
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,350
You have money. Lots of money.

917
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,590
We do, and we don't.

918
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,990
Most of our money is tied up in these projects.

919
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,990
And John had such bad luck with cards
before he met me.

920
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,030
It's a long story, Molly.

921
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,350
I need about 200 guineas.

922
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,070
Jane!

923
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,510
I haven't got two guineas!

924
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,350
Well, can't we take some things to Bond Street,
get our money back?

925
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,870
Take things back to Bond Street?

926
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,910
Don't be such a fool, Jane.

927
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,670
Buying jewelery is one thing,
selling it back is another.

928
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,590
But John said! Oh, I don't know what to believe.

929
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,950
I'll tell you what you can believe, Jane.

930
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,070
You're the laugh of London.

931
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,310
Rossendale's a reckless gambler,

932
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,310
and if you don't give him up,
you'll go down with him.

933
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,590
Molly, you're my best friend.

934
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,710
What will I do?

935
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,750
Do as I do

936
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,510
Dry your tears, make up your face,

937
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,030
wear your hair high, and your dress cut low.

938
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,670
Drop Rossendale.

939
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,710
What do you think I am, Molly?

940
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,350
A wh...

941
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,790
A whore? That's the word you're looking for.

942
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,190
I'm a whore, Jane.

943
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,430
An honest one. You are dishonest.

944
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,030
I just tell lies to the men in my life.

945
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,030
You lie to yourself.

946
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,580
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

947
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,150
Your money's run out.
I'm going back to France, to Colonel Wigram.

948
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,780
I've been away a long time.
It'll be hard work getting him back.

949
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,430
Hair high,

950
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,710
how dresses.

951
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,990
Laugh like a lady, and make love like a whore.

952
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,870
What will happen to me?

953
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,190
Oh, don't worry.
You have a better bust than mine,

954
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,430
and a much stronger stomach.

955
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,230
CALVET: That is where
Ducos and his men are hiding out.

956
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,550
We are here. We march around the bay.

957
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,590
No, across the bay

958
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,240
We'll steal two boats. We can attack tonight.

959
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,270
In Russia, I ate my own corporal.

960
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,910
Disgusting.

961
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,790
(Woman hums)

962
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,910
(Laughter)

963
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,950
(Music box plays)

964
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,990
(Giggling)

965
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,070
(Hums)

966
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,270
Dai.

967
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,830
(Tuts)

968
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,670
(Gasps)

969
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,660
(Gasps)

970
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,710
Salope!

971
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,150
(Pants)

972
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,430
CHALLON: Calvet.

973
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,470
MAN: Oh là là!

974
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,820
CHALLON: Allez. Dépêchez-vous.

975
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,870
Venez vite.

976
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,110
MAN: Allez... De la poudre...

977
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,150
Ugh!

978
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,150
CHALLON: Allez plus vite.

979
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,110
MAN: On est prêt. Là.
CHALLON: Dépêchez-vous.

980
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:54,470
CALVET: Those ruins are like rabbit warrens.
Four men could hold off an army.

981
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,510
How many has he got?

982
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,550
Let's find out.

983
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,230
Look, can you get your men
to take these bloody white cross belts off?

984
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,620
- They stand out a mile.
- Remove their belts?

985
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,670
These are the Imperial Guard, my friend.

986
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,990
They have worn these belts
in every one of Bonaparte's battlefields,

987
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,230
from Austerlitz to Borodino.
They would sooner take off their skins.

988
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,270
Very well.

989
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,310
But you'll let us go up there first.

990
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,230
Soon as you hear a shot, you'll attack.

991
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,550
Frederickson, take the left.

992
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,590
Harper, you take the right.

993
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,510
En avant!

994
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,110
Marche!

995
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,750
(Click)

996
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,430
Get down!

997
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,190
Good shooting, Sharpe.

998
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,310
He stepped into my sights.

999
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,750
Yes, but you could have missed.

1000
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,110
CHALLON: Merde. Remettez-moi ça sur la table.

1001
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,670
Allez. Remettez ça.

1002
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,630
Par ici!

1003
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,910
Take me to Ducos.

1004
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,950
Présent...

1005
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,710
Feu!

1006
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,830
Par ici.

1007
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,870
SHARPE: Harper.

1008
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,950
MAN: La porte, la porte!

1009
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,750
MAN: Oh, merde!

1010
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,660
Ducos! Where’s Ducos?

1011
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,390
The gold, Gaston, the gold!

1012
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,110
Mon général!

1013
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,150
The bastard's gone to get help.

1014
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,590
(Crashing)

1015
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,350
Ducos

1016
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,390
The war is over, Sharpe.

1017
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,790
Apparently, not for you.

1018
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,150
Let me offer you a choice.

1019
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,070
You can die up there, or you can die down here.

1020
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,790
If you make me come up for you,

1021
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,830
you will die very slowly,

1022
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,870
And very painfully.

1023
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,790
If you come down here. With your hands up.

1024
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,110
I'll shoot you like a soldier.

1025
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,470
You have my word.

1026
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,470
Your word?

1027
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,630
I give you my word before General Calvet,
with whom I have no quarrel.

1028
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,670
You're a damn liar, Ducos!

1029
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,950
I say the same. You would shoot me too?

1030
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,990
Why would you spare my life?

1031
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,030
Why indeed?

1032
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,070
Well,

1033
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,110
you will have to take your chance.

1034
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,110
Gentlemen, you have two minutes to surrender.

1035
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,430
(Sighs)

1036
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,910
What about this grasshopper gun?

1037
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,950
It won't stop 100 men, spread out on all sides.

1038
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,390
Spread out on all sides...

1039
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,150
That's it.

1040
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,190
Frederickson?

1041
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,660
Fix me some powder charges.

1042
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,820
For grapeshot?

1043
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,270
Not grapeshot. Gold.

1044
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,630
Non.

1045
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,550
Make a choice Calvet-
you lose this box of gold, or you lose the lot.

1046
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,550
Frederickson, you man the gun.

1047
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,870
Harper, let's finish that bastard off,
once and for all.

1048
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,230
Soldati, avanti!

1049
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,670
(Gunshot)

1050
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,230
SOLDIER: È oro!

1051
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,190
Lasciate tutto questo!

1052
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,790
Siamo ricchi.

1053
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,950
Fire the next one away from the boats.

1054
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,230
(All shout excitedly)

1055
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,990
Vigliacchi!

1056
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:08,590
MAN: Andiamo! Dai, dai! Qua!

1057
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:11,830
Tonate indietro!

1058
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,150
Did I get him?

1059
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,910
Don't worry, he's done for.

1060
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,430
Allez.

1061
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,950
Fait attention!

1062
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,950
Allez.

1063
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,550
Ça y est. C'est bon.

1064
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,940
(All groan)

1065
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,030
I came for the gold, and I got the gold.

1066
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,310
What did you come for, Major Sharpe?

1067
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,270
For my name,

1068
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,270
and for revenge.

1069
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,110
Ducos is dead. You have your revenge.

1070
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,910
Am I misunderstanding something,
Sergeant Harper?

1071
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,430
Ducos was only half his revenge, sir.

1072
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,110
Cherchez la femme?

1073
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,150
The other half is a woman?

1074
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,590
Now you have it

1075
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,630
Boats at the ready, sir.

1076
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,310
Forget this other woman.

1077
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:50,510
Forget your revenge.

1078
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,030
I saw the way Madame Maillot looked at you
back at her château.

1079
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,230
I already have a wife.

1080
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,230
No, you don't.

1081
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,270
Not any more.

1082
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,630
Order.

1083
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,670
This tribunal is now in session.

1084
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,670
Major Sharpe, you may stand.

1085
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,030
I adjourned this tribunal some three months ago

1086
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,580
to allow Colonel Maillot to give testimony.

1087
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,950
In the meantime, Major Sharpe escaped

1088
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,030
and murdered Colonel Maillot.

1089
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,270
I will now send him for court martial.

1090
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:42,150
I have no doubt the penalty will be death.

1091
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:45,750
Monsieur Roland,
is there anything you'd wish to add?

1092
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,430
With the deepest respect, Colonel Wigram,

1093
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:54,710
I must tell you that there is not a word of truth

1094
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,750
in the case against Major Sharpe.

1095
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,950
What's he saying?

1096
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,790
(Murmuring)

1097
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,990
Silence! What the devil do you mean by this,
Monsieur Roland?

1098
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:11,590
This is the sworn testimony
of General Maurice Calvet,

1099
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:16,390
the general who commanded Major Ducos
to take the imperial treasure to Paris.

1100
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,510
This statement was given in my presence
two nights ago.

1101
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:25,030
This testimony makes it clear

1102
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:29,510
that this tribunal has no choice
but to discharge Major Sharpe

1103
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,510
without a stain on his character.

1104
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,830
MAN: Well said.

1105
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,430
What about the murder of Colonel Maillot?

1106
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,470
There was one witness to that murder,
Colonel Wigram -

1107
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,510
Colonel Maillot's sister,

1108
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,510
Madame Lucille Dubert.

1109
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,510
She is in this court today,

1110
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,510
and she is prepared
to testify to the innocence of Major Sharpe.

1111
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:08,670
(Gavel bangs)

1112
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,590
Do you wish to hear her testimony,
or do you take my word?

1113
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,660
Yes, yes!

1114
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,990
Before you adjourn this tribunal, sir,

1115
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,030
I am instructed
by His Majesty King Louis Philippe

1116
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:29,310
to say that France withdraws all charges
against Major Sharpe,

1117
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,910
and expresses her deep regret

1118
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,070
for any damage that might have been done

1119
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,860
to the good name of this good officer.

1120
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,790
(Murmurs of assent)

1121
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,790
(Gavel bangs)

1122
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,830
This tribunal...

1123
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,060
...finds there is no case against Major Sharpe.

1124
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,110
Accordingly, I...

1125
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,150
I am closing the proceedings.

1126
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,750
Congratulations! Congratulations!

1127
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,790
Major, congratulations. Wonderful news.

1128
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,030
- Oh, what wonderful news.
- Terrific.

1129
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,070
Terrific.

1130
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,750
Good shooting, Frederickson.

1131
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,400
They stepped into my sights.

1132
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,230
You could've missed.

1133
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,910
Where to now, William?

1134
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,110
Home.

1135
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,150
Become a lawyer.

1136
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,190
Barrack-room lawyer?

1137
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,230
No,

1138
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,230
bedroom lawyer

1139
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,270
In five years' time,
every rich widow in Westphalia

1140
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,310
will come to me if she has difficulties with her will.

1141
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,630
Your woman is waiting for you, Richard.

1142
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,430
(Woman laughs)

1143
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,670
Come on.

1144
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,710
We're going home.

1145
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,670
MAN: Congratulations, Sharpe... Well done...

1146
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,430
(Screams)

1147
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,470
(Wind whistles)

1148
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,550
There's nobody there, Jane.

1149
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,670
(Sighs) Nobody at all.

1150
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,830
(Sighs)

1151
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,270
What's the matter?

1152
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,870
I had a letter from Molly this morning.

1153
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,830
Richard has cleared his name.

1154
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,830
He's free to come home.

1155
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,830
He'll have his revenge on us, John.

1156
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,150
Will you go

1157
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,190
Or will you...

1158
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:22,230
This time tomorrow, you will be in England.

1159
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,750
I'll be back.

1160
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,140
I know

1161
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:36,500
Would this moment last for ever?

1162
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,160
Kiss me now

1163
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:42,520
And leave me never

1164
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:48,510
Oh, farewell
