1
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,100
TO BE OR NOT TO BE

2
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:34,685
<i>Lubinski, Kubinski...</i>

3
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:38,393
<i>Lominski, Rozanski and Poznanski.</i>

4
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,794
<i>We're in Warsaw, the capital of Poland.</i>

5
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,748
<i>It's August, 1939. Europe is still at peace.</i>

6
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:50,358
<i>At the moment, life in Warsaw
is going on as normally as ever.</i>

7
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,718
<i>But suddenly,
something seems to have happened.</i>

8
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,938
<i>Are those Poles seeing a ghost?
Why does this car suddenly stop?</i>

9
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,175
<i>Everybody seems to be staring
in one direction.</i>

10
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,293
<i>People seem to be frightened,
even terrified. Some flabbergasted.</i>

11
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,797
<i>Can it be true? It must be true. No doubt.</i>

12
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,971
<i>The man with the little mustache,
Adolf Hitler.</i>

13
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,243
<i>Adolf Hitler in Warsaw
when the two countries are still at peace...</i>

14
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:11,608
<i>and all by himself?</i>

15
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>He seems strangely unconcerned
by all the excitement he's causing.</i>

16
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:19,245
<i>Is he by any chance interested
in Mr. Maslowski's delicatessen?</i>

17
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:21,993
<i>That's impossible! He's a vegetarian.</i>

18
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:24,969
<i>And yet,
he doesn't always stick to his diet.</i>

19
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:29,338
<i>Sometimes he swallows whole countries.
Does he want to eat up Poland, too?</i>

20
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,590
<i>Anyhow, how did he get here?
What happened?</i>

21
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:37,114
<i>It all started in the General Headquarters
of the Gestapo in Berlin.</i>

22
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:43,511
Heil Hitler.

23
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:48,422
Heil Hitler!
- Colonel, we have Wilhelm Coetze here.

24
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:50,072
If you'd like to look into his record.

25
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,743
I hope he'll talk!
- He'd better.

26
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,975
Send him in.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,735
Wilhelm Coetze!

28
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,585
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

29
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:11,925
And now, Wilhelm, I understand
you want a little tank to play with.

30
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,891
Yes, my father promised me one
if I got a good report card.

31
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,157
But our Fuhrer
heard about your report card...

32
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,492
and decided to give you
just what you want.

33
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,652
Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

34
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,028
You are going to tell your father
who gave it to you, aren't you, Wilhelm?

35
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,406
Sure, our Fuhrer.

36
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:33,637
And then maybe he will like the Fuhrer
a little better, won't he?

37
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:34,604
Sure.

38
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:39,025
He doesn't like him now, does he?
- No, he doesn't.

39
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:44,448
And sometimes he even says funny things
about him, doesn't he?

40
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,823
Well, he said they named a brandy
after Napoleon...

41
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,979
and they made a herring out of Bismarck.

42
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:52,337
And Hitler's going to end up as...
- A piece of cheese.

43
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,660
- Yes.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:57,002
How did you know?
- Well, it's a natural thought.

45
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,029
A natural thought?!

46
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:02,196
I hope you don't misunderstand.
I always, that is...

47
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,453
You see, Colonel,
I hope you don't doubt my...

48
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:07,729
Heil Hitler!

49
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:13,558
The Fuhrer!

50
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,398
Heil Hitler!

51
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,817
Heil Hitler!

52
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,664
Heil myself.

53
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,291
That's not in the script!

54
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:29,448
But, Mr. Dobosh, please.
- That's not in the script, Mr. Bronski.

55
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,869
But it'll get a laugh.
- I don't want a laugh here.

56
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:33,943
How many times have I told you
not to add any lines?

57
00:04:34,053 --> 00:04:35,925
I want...
- You want my opinion, Mr. Dobosh?

58
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:37,610
No Mr. Greenberg, I don't
want your opinion.

59
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,290
All right, then let me give you my reaction.

60
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,003
A laugh is nothing to be sneezed at.

61
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:44,027
Mr. Greenberg, I hired you as an actor,
not as a writer. Understand?

62
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:45,836
No. What does the script say?

63
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,642
I make an entrance.
- And what do you say?

64
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,310
Nothing.
- Then say nothing.

65
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:55,713
Here am I sitting, waiting for my scene,
all eager to go...

66
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:58,645
and I have to wait and wait
to be driven out of my mood...

67
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:02,313
just because two little actors in the cast
want to enlarge their parts.

68
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:05,028
Mr. Rawitch, what you are, I wouldn't eat.

69
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:07,300
How dare you call me a ham!

70
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,854
Folks, I want everybody
to understand this.

71
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:13,402
This is a serious play,
a realistic drama...

72
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:14,923
Good morning, Dobosh.
- Good morning.

73
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,438
How do you like my dress?
- Very good. Very good.

74
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:18,859
It is a document of Nazi...

75
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,298
Is that what you're wearing
in the concentration camp?

76
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,071
Don't you think it's pretty?
- That's just it.

77
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,625
Well, why not?
I think it's a tremendous contrast.

78
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:29,165
Think of me being flogged in the darkness.
I scream, the lights go on...

79
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:31,588
and the audience sees me on the floor
in this gorgeous dress.

80
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,767
That's a terrific laugh.
- That's right, Greenberg.

81
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:35,171
You keep out of this!

82
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,062
That a great star, an artist,
could be so inartistic.

83
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,426
You must be out of your mind!

84
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,411
What do you mean by talking to my wife
like that? How dare you!

85
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm sorry. I lost my temper.

86
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,655
Sweetheart, the dress stinks.

87
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,877
You're only afraid
I'm running away with the scene.

88
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:50,521
I afraid? Why should I be?

89
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,503
Of course not.
You're the best actor in the world.

90
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,978
Everybody knows that, even you.
- Don't be a prima donna.

91
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:58,647
Any chance to take the spotlight away
from me, it's ridiculous how you grab it.

92
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,397
Whenever I start a story, you finish it.

93
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:01,992
Should if I go on a
diet, you lose the weight.

94
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,496
If I have a cold, you cough.

95
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:06,381
And if we should ever have a baby,
I'm not so sure I'd be the mother.

96
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,028
I'm satisfied to be the father.

97
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,910
Mr. Dobosh, look,
if you'll just give me a chance...

98
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,154
Who made you up?
- I did, Mr. Dobosh.

99
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:18,455
What's wrong with it?
- I don't know. It's not convincing.

100
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,648
To me, he's just a man
with a little mustache.

101
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:21,785
But so was Hitler.

102
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,359
Wait, it's not just the mustache.
It's... I don't know.

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,925
I just can't smell Hitler in him.
- I can.

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,476
I know! I know!

105
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,591
That picture!
That's what he should look like!

106
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,884
But that picture was taken of me.

107
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,001
Then the picture's wrong, too.

108
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:48,939
Now, see here, Mr. Dobosh,
I'm a nobody and I have to take a lot.

109
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:52,643
But I know I look like Hitler,
and I'm going to prove it right now.

110
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:55,599
I'm going out on the street
and see what happens.

111
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:03,188
<i>And that's how Adolf Hitler
came to Warsaw in August, 1939.</i>

112
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,103
May I have your autograph, Mr. Bronski?

113
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:12,042
Bronski?
- Why, certainly.

114
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,500
Jospeh Tura i Maria Tura
in "Hamlet"

115
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,285
I know it would get a laugh.

116
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,424
Then Dobosh said to me,
"Bronski, you're going to play Hitler."

117
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,455
I thought that was the real start
of my career.

118
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:40,072
Don't worry, Bronski.
They can't keep real talent down forever.

119
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,008
And the day will come
when you'll play Shylock.

120
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:44,123
The Rialto scene.

121
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:47,741
Shakespeare must have thought of me
when he wrote this. It's me.

122
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,530
"Have I not eyes? Have I not hands...

123
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:54,678
"organs, senses, dimensions,
affections, passions?

124
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:59,145
"Fed with the same food,
hurt with the same weapons...

125
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,546
"subject to the same diseases.

126
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:03,967
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?

127
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:06,572
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

128
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,123
"if you poison us,...
do we not die?"

129
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:13,300
You'd move them to tears.

130
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,430
Instead, I have to carry a spear.

131
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,189
That's all we do, carry a spear.

132
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:19,949
Carry a spear in the first act,
and in the second act.

133
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,064
Carry Rawitch off the scene in the last act.

134
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,788
How I'd love to drop that ham
right in the center of the stage.

135
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:26,309
Would get a terrific laugh.

136
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,789
Hello, this is Mr. Tura.

137
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:39,236
Will you please order me a salami and
cheese sandwich and a glass of beer.

138
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:41,366
Right away, please. Thank you.

139
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,867
The audience is a little cool tonight.
- Not to me.

140
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:48,236
I know I'm giving a rotten performance.
I always do when we quarrel.

141
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:51,021
Say something nice.
- You faker.

142
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,838
I watched your scene with Polonius.
You were never better.

143
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,559
I'd give you a kiss right now,
but I'm afraid I'll ruin my makeup.

144
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:58,800
Darling, you were right this morning.

145
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:02,471
I felt so rotten after the rehearsal,
I went to Dobosh and told him...

146
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:04,611
when he advertises the new play
to put your name first.

147
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:08,784
Did you, darling? That's sweet of you.
But I really don't care.

148
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,973
That's what Dobosh said,
so we left it as it was.

149
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,579
But, darling,
you know how I feel about you.

150
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,095
Why I'd even...

151
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,879
Flowers?
- Aren't they beautiful?

152
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:23,421
Don't be casual. Who sent them?

153
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,772
I don't know. There was no card.

154
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:27,629
No card again? That's three nights
in succession. Who is he?

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,110
I'm sure this has nothing to do
with me personally.

156
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,457
This man probably loves theater,
an art fanatic.

157
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,548
Someone sitting in the gallery
night after night...

158
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,048
Just one of those poor boys
who can't afford a ticket...

159
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,611
but inherited a lot of flowers
and is trying to get rid of them.

160
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:40,889
Three nights in a row.

161
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,122
Even Shakespeare couldn't see Hamlet
three nights in succession.

162
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:47,375
You forget you're playing Hamlet.
- That's right.

163
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:49,198
Mr. Tura on stage!

164
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,377
Maria, darling,
I'm going into my big scene.

165
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,648
Joseph, sweetheart,
I swear I don't know who it is.

166
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,236
Thanks, darling.

167
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:03,786
It's true, Anna, I don't know who it is.

168
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:05,609
But I'm positive who it might be.

169
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:08,216
You mean that young aviator?
- Yes, he's very young.

170
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:11,289
He's in the second row again.
He gets better-looking every night.

171
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,500
Don't misunderstand me.

172
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,725
I love my husband dearly, and why not?

173
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:15,854
He's wonderful.

174
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,550
Only he gets so unreasonable,
so upset about little things.

175
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:20,989
Like the little thing in the second row.

176
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,104
Waiting for an answer.

177
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:43,539
"Lt. Stanislav Sobinski."
I was right, it is a young aviator.

178
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,798
Is he suffering very much?
- Yes, he had to break his silence.

179
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,713
He couldn't bear it any longer?
- No, he couldn't.

180
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:52,550
Poor little thing.
- He's just a mere boy.

181
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,483
Oh, no. - What's he want
you to do, adopt him?

182
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,933
He's dying to see me,
even if it's just for a minute.

183
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:03,496
Of course I won't. Definitely not.
Yet, I don't like to be rude to him.

184
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:07,052
I think it's a mistake to ignore people
who admire one and buy the tickets...

185
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,613
Darling, don't waste any more time
with excuses.

186
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,245
If you want to see him,
see him while he's still young.

187
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,949
Yes, I think I owe it to my public.

188
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,514
Dear Lieutenant...
Wait till you see him, Anna.

189
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:23,781
Unfortunately my time
is completely taken up.

190
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:27,490
But if you insist on seeing me,
come back to my dressing room...

191
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:31,484
when Hamlet goes into his soliloquy,
"To be or not to be."

192
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,427
How does it sound?
- Safe.

193
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,597
"O heavy burden!"

194
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,194
"I hear him coming.!

195
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,974
"Let's withdraw, my lord."

196
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:16,025
"To be, or not to be.."

197
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:17,542
"That is..."

198
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:20,956
"That is the question."

199
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,312
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer"

200
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,215
"The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

201
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,135
"Or to take arms..."

202
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,802
Thank you, Mrs. Tura, for receiving me.

203
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:42,809
If you knew how I was looking forward
to this moment...

204
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,723
And now you're probably disappointed.
- Mrs. Tura.

205
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,857
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

206
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:52,786
So you are the gentleman that sent me
those lovely flowers. Thank you.

207
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:56,972
Somehow, I pictured you quite differently
as a dignified old gentleman.

208
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,410
And now I see you...

209
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,141
I wonder if it was the right thing
to ask you back here.

210
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,117
You see, I never see strangers
in my dressing room.

211
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:06,670
But you are no stranger to me.
I've seen you in everything you've played.

212
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:09,326
I'll never forget how I laughed
when I saw you as Kiki.

213
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:11,539
Some people thought I was funny.

214
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:14,355
But you certainly weren't funny
when you played Lady Macbeth.

215
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,943
Thank you.
- I was really scared of you that night.

216
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:19,675
Of poor little me? I wouldn't hurt a fly.

217
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:22,672
Or a goldfish. By the way, how is he?

218
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,673
Who? - The goldfish.

219
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:27,719
What goldfish?
- The one you're so attached to.

220
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:29,805
You see, I read all your interviews.

221
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,660
Oh, yes, of course.

222
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:36,203
When I saw that picture of you
at the farm, behind the plough...

223
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,462
By the way, where was that?
- In The Chronicle.

224
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,253
No, I mean, where is the farm?

225
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:44,127
No, I think we've talked
much too much about me.

226
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:45,892
Tell me about yourself.

227
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,592
There isn't much to tell.
I just fly a bomber.

228
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,274
How perfectly thrilling.

229
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:54,585
I don't know about its being thrilling,
but it's quite a bomber.

230
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:57,815
You may not believe it, but I can drop
three tons of dynamite in two minutes.

231
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,141
Really?
- Does that interest you?

232
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:01,602
It certainly does.

233
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,362
I don't want to overstep myself,
but I'll take a chance.

234
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,072
Would you permit me
to show you my plane?

235
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,944
Maybe.
- When shall I call for you?

236
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:09,829
Tomorrow at 2:00 at my home.

237
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,015
No, I'd better meet you
right at the airport.

238
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:14,096
Goodbye.

239
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:20,529
I hope you forgive me
if I acted a little clumsy...

240
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,932
but this is the first time
I ever met an actress.

241
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,885
Lieutenant, this is the first time
I've ever met a man...

242
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:29,173
who could drop three tons of dynamite
in two minutes. Bye.

243
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:30,990
Bye.

244
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:36,667
Tomorrow at 2:00,
I'm gonna look down on Warsaw.

245
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,738
He's gonna take me up
10,000 feet in the air.

246
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,480
There's nothing wrong in that, is there?

247
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,313
No, not at all.
As long as Tura doesn't find out.

248
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,349
After all, what a husband doesn't know
won't hurt his wife.

249
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:05,783
It happened.

250
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,620
What every actor dreads.

251
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,300
What, darling? What?

252
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:13,455
Someone walked out on me.

253
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,109
Tell me, Maria, am I losing my grip?

254
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:20,767
Of course not, darling. I'm so sorry.

255
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,474
But he walked out on me.

256
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,467
Maybe he didn't feel well.
Maybe he had to leave.

257
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,191
Maybe he had a sudden heart attack.

258
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:30,699
I hope so.
- lf he stayed, he might have died.

259
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:34,321
Maybe he's dead already.
Darling, you're so comforting.

260
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:46,901
What's going on?
- Hitler's speaking to the Reichstag.

261
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,491
How do you do, Mr. Dobosh?
- How do you do, Doctor?

262
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,415
This is Dr. Voyawski
from the Foreign Office.

263
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:01,711
How do you do, gentlemen?

264
00:16:02,284 --> 00:16:03,801
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

265
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,642
The government feels it would be unwise
to go on with this play.

266
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:08,215
What?

267
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,247
You mean, we cannot open tonight?

268
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,399
I'm afraid that's what it comes down to.
- But why?

269
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:18,942
We all have a right to know.
- I know the play has artistic value.

270
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,155
It has much more than that.

271
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,360
That's exactly what the government
is afraid of.

272
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:24,896
It might offend Hitler.

273
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,021
Well, wouldn't that be too bad.

274
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,277
Have you ever read what he says
about us? Do you ever listen to him?

275
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:33,628
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but the order is final.

276
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,860
Joseph Tura and Maria Tura
GESTAPO

277
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,820
CHANGE OF PROGRAM
Tonight "HAMLET"

278
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:58,358
"To be, or not to be."

279
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,052
"That is..."

280
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:04,096
"That is the question!"

281
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:07,244
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind"

282
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:11,665
"To suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune..."

283
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:18,275
Anna, I'd like to speak to
Mrs. Tura alone.

284
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,245
Now look, Stanislav, I usually
tell my maid when to leave the room.

285
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:28,140
I have so much to tell you.
When we're in the plane, we can't talk.

286
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,181
When we're in the tearoom,
we can't do anything but talk.

287
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:34,214
When we're in the dressing room,
we must be very careful of my makeup.

288
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,048
You know, Maria,
the other day in the plane...

289
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:42,703
you didn't think I was watching
but I saw you looking at me.

290
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:45,659
It was a very sympathetic look, I thought.

291
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,355
I had the feeling you like me.
Was I wrong?

292
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,799
No, not at all, Stanislav.

293
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:53,860
Tell me, Maria. Be
frank. You still like me?

294
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,209
Well, of course.

295
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,619
You still like me, huh?
You think you'll always like me?

296
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:00,550
I don't see any reason why not.

297
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,583
That's wonderful.

298
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,890
What are we going to do
with your husband?

299
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,285
What?
- We must tell him, of course.

300
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,770
Tell him what?

301
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:12,523
That we love each other,
that we're mad about each other.

302
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,617
He has no right to stand in our way.

303
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,062
I'm sure he'll realize the situation.
So will Mr. Dobosh.

304
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,114
Dobosh? Where does he come in?
- You don't want to stay on the stage?

305
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,803
I wouldn't let you.
You're tired of it, anyway.

306
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:26,506
You want to live a quiet life.
You said so in The Chronicle.

307
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,433
Darling, you're really
going to enjoy that farm now.

308
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:32,089
You won't have to use that plough.
I'll buy you a tractor.

309
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:34,121
I'll build a swimming pool
for your goldfish.

310
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,563
You're really a darling...

311
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,815
but you don't realize
that I'm a married woman.

312
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:39,162
That's why I must talk to your husband.

313
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:40,527
But I love my husband.

314
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,563
No, you don't.

315
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:46,328
You're just decent, you're kind,
and you feel sorry for him.

316
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:48,793
Now, don't you worry.
It's a situation between men.

317
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:50,620
I'll wait here for him.

318
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,408
Stanislav, you must listen to me.

319
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,974
This is probably all my fault,
but you must understand that l...

320
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:56,431
Mrs. Tura!
- Stay out, Anna.

321
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:57,892
Mrs. Tura, it's war!

322
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:06,209
"Without any declaration of war...

323
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:09,385
"German troops crossed our border
at several points this evening."

324
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,496
Without a word of warning.

325
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,858
They'll pay before they're through.
We'll gonna fight them.

326
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,594
War. It's really war.

327
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,947
People are going to kill each
other and be killed.

328
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:22,950
Stanislav...

329
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:24,584
Goodbye, Maria.

330
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:30,352
Maria! Have you heard?
- Yes, it's war.

331
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:31,997
It seems impossible. It's incredible.

332
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,126
Does the audience know yet?
- No, I have to make an anouncement.

333
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:36,553
It's a conspiracy. That's it!
A foul conspiracy!

334
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:38,955
It's worse than that. It's a crime!
- You're absolutely right.

335
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,834
Walking out on me for the second time.

336
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,463
What are you talking about?
- Don't you understand? It's war!

337
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:46,114
It's an air alarm!

338
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:55,667
Close the window!
Hurry up, to the basement. Quick!

339
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,939
Anyway, we don't have to worry
about the Nazi play anymore.

340
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,140
The Nazis themselves are putting on
the show now. A much bigger one.

341
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,748
There's no censor to stop them.

342
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:52,575
<i>Unhappy Poland.</i>

343
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:56,728
<i>Attacked without a word of warning
by a ruthless conqueror.</i>

344
00:20:56,891 --> 00:21:00,505
<i>Warsaw destroyed
for the sake of destruction.</i>

345
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,569
<i>The curtain had fallen
on the Polish drama.</i>

346
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,911
<i>A tragedy with no relief in sight.</i>

347
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:11,117
<i>There was a Nazi tank
against every Polish hope...</i>

348
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,056
<i>and the people were
stunned and helpless.</i>

349
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,708
There was no censor to stop them.

350
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:09,419
"If you prick us,
do we not bleed?

351
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:13,147
"If you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

352
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:17,231
"If you poison us,
do we not die?"

353
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:21,921
What a Shylock you would have been.

354
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:25,585
All I had to do was to carry a spear.

355
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:29,145
I wonder if we'll ever
carry a spear again.

356
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:31,260
Let's hope so.

357
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,382
<i>But a new spirit had come over
the people of Poland.</i>

358
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:39,810
<i>Hate and more hate
was the answer to the Nazi terror.</i>

359
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,536
<i>Rebellion against suppression.</i>

360
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,001
<i>Determination to fight at any moment,
anywhere, everywhere.</i>

361
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,286
<i>The battle was on. "V."</i>

362
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:49,994
<i>"V" for "victory!"</i>

363
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:52,365
<i>Down with the Nazis!
Down with Hitler!</i>

364
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:54,605
<i>The Warsaw underground striking back...</i>

365
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,667
<i>sabotage, destruction.</i>

366
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,581
<i>But the real fight for Polish freedom
was led somewhere in England.</i>

367
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:04,553
<i>Young men of Poland
avenging their country...</i>

368
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,257
<i>the Polish squadron of the RAF.</i>

369
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:40,208
Well, it's gratifying to see that
you still keep your sense of humor.

370
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:42,781
We are even much funnier over Berlin.

371
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,855
I only wish that I were young enough
to do for our country what you're doing.

372
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:50,016
Come on, Professor. One of your
radio speeches is worth 10,000 bombs.

373
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,818
When do we hear you again,
Professor Siletsky?

374
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:55,376
I'm afraid it might be
quite some time.

375
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,081
Why? What's the matter?

376
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,675
Nothing. I just happen to be going
on a little trip.

377
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,386
And anybody that buys a return ticket
these days is decidedly an optimist.

378
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,439
You are going
on a secret mission, Professor?

379
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:08,987
I see it's no use.
You boys are too clever for me.

380
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:11,327
Now I know. He's going
to Berlin to call on Hitler.

381
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:17,122
Not exactly. And I certainly hope that
Hitler doesn't call on me.

382
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:21,380
Well gentlemen, thank you for
honoring me with an excellent dinner.

383
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,423
Professor, are you going to Warsaw?
- That would be risking your neck.

384
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:27,046
After all, you boys risk your lives
every day, don't you?

385
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,417
So you are going to Warsaw.

386
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:32,088
Gentlemen, please, I
can't tell you any more.

387
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,927
I'm sorry that I even mentioned it.

388
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:35,780
But you didn't.
- We got it out of you.

389
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,740
After all, if I can't trust you,
whom can I trust?

390
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,362
And I know it will be buried right here.

391
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:45,191
Warsaw.

392
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:48,965
I'd give my soul to be there
for just one hour to see my mother.

393
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,278
If she's still alive.

394
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:53,593
I only wish it were possible
for me to find out.

395
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,119
Could you find out, please? My mother...

396
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,103
I understand exactly how you feel.
But you must realize...

397
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:01,779
I cannot possibly jeopardize
the purpose of my trip.

398
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,528
Why don't you tell me
where I can reach your people...

399
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:07,019
and I'll try my best?

400
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:15,011
Professor Siletsky? - Yes.

401
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,804
My people are fortunately
out of Poland...

402
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,448
but there is someone in Warsaw.

403
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,455
A lady? - Yes.

404
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:27,172
It's a very confidential matter.
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell her...

405
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,340
But don't tell her husband.

406
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,534
Now, I know exactly what to tell her.

407
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:34,540
Just say, "To be or not to be."
She knows.

408
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:36,615
A code message?

409
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,836
What's the name of the lady?

410
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,657
It's Maria Tura.
- Just a moment. I'll write it down.

411
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,571
What did you say the name was?

412
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:49,682
Maria Tura.
- T-U-R-A. That's right?

413
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,564
Don't tell me you've never
heard of Maria Tura?

414
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,179
Why? Should I?

415
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,500
Well, you lived in Warsaw...

416
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,791
Yes, of course. The name is familiar.

417
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,180
She's quite well-known.

418
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,132
Well-known? She's famous.
- Yes, indeed.

419
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,500
Here, it's the name of my brother.

420
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,350
I don't know if you
can read the writing.

421
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,140
MILITARY INTELIGENCE
V

422
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,170
- All right.
- Lieutenant.

423
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:26,088
- How do you do, sir?
- Gen. Armstrong.

424
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,751
Major Cunningham.
- How do you do?

425
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,613
Now what did you want
to see me about, Lieutenant?

426
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:32,192
I was thinking about coming here
for a couple of days.

427
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:35,378
I'm probably doing an injustice
to an important man.

428
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:36,520
Whom do you suspect?

429
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,464
You see, sir, the other night...

430
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,443
Professor Siletsky was addressing us
at the camp...

431
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,261
and I mentioned the name of Maria Tura
and he'd never heard of her.

432
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:44,440
Neither have I.

433
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:46,667
But he's supposed to be
a Pole who lived in Warsaw.

434
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:48,412
She's the most famous
actress in Warsaw.

435
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,886
Young man, there are lots of people
who are not interested in the theater.

436
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,695
In matter fact, there's only
one actress I ever heard of.

437
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:57,195
And I certainly hope
I'll never hear from her again.

438
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:00,630
Sir, Maria Tura's more than an actress.
She's an institution.

439
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,632
You couldn't buy a newspaper
without reading about her.

440
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,471
You can't buy a package of cigarettes
without her picture inside.

441
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:06,813
They name soap after her.

442
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:09,911
You couldn't move around in Warsaw
without popping into her.

443
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:12,881
I thought it was my duty to tell you
before the professor leaves.

444
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:15,555
He left already, didn't he?
- Yes, he was due in Sweden yesterday.

445
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,900
Just a minute.
How'd you know he was leaving?

446
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,475
He told us.
- Told you what?

447
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,938
That he was going to Warsaw.
- That seems incredible.

448
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:25,285
After all, we were all Poles together,
nobody saw anything wrong in it.

449
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:27,703
Otherwise, the boys wouldn't
give him the addresses.

450
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,758
What addresses?
- Of the relatives in Warsaw.

451
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,672
He took them?
- Yes, sir.

452
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,443
How could he do such a thing?

453
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:35,409
If they fall into the hands
of the Gestapo...

454
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,711
they can take reprisals
against all the families.

455
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,662
When does Professor Siletsky
get to Warsaw?

456
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:42,027
He probably took the boat
today for Lithuania.

457
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,969
And from Lithuania, that's uncertain.
I shall say, three or four days, sir.

458
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:47,678
How long will it take you
to fly to Warsaw?

459
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,590
About ...six or seven hours, sir.

460
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,995
You mind waiting outside a minute?
- Yes, sir.

461
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:57,702
I hate to believe it.

462
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:00,487
So do I, sir. We can't take any chances.

463
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:04,129
The fellow came here with
the highest recommendations possible.

464
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:05,988
And we checked again and again, sir.

465
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:09,129
This man is carrying instructions
to the underground in Warsaw.

466
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:10,478
If he delivers them...

467
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,374
to the Gestapo
instead of the underground...

468
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:14,503
it means, not only the death
of hundreds of people...

469
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,428
but the destruction of our organization
in Eastern Europe.

470
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,631
Of course. But I hate to condemn a man
on such vague evidence.

471
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,902
We're not condemning him.

472
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,091
When Siletsky told those fliers of his trip
to Warsaw, he wrote his own sentence.

473
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:29,785
Of course, he may be just a fool.

474
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:31,543
Then he's just as dangerous.

475
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,172
And I know Siletsky. He's no fool.

476
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,695
Well, sir, what are your orders?

477
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,368
Call in the young man.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:44,919
<i>Now look here, Lieutenant...</i>

479
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,703
<i>as soon as you get to Warsaw...</i>

480
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,639
<i>go to Sztaluga 's bookstore...</i>

481
00:28:48,787 --> 00:28:50,163
<i>and give him our instructions.</i>

482
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:52,634
<i>Sztaluga will then inform
the underground.</i>

483
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,480
<i>But if someone happens to be in the store,
don't mention anything.</i>

484
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:59,547
<i>Just ask for a copy
of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.</i>

485
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:02,829
<i>And put Siletsky's picture on Page 105.</i>

486
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,969
<i>Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.</i>

487
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:33,918
Ten minutes.
- All right.

488
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,258
Halt!

489
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:03,470
Too bad we missed him.

490
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:36,771
Good evening.
- Good evening.

491
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:39,657
Have you by any chance
Anna Karenina by Tolstoy?

492
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:42,136
I think I have.

493
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:46,164
Yes.

494
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:48,881
Here it is.

495
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,980
How much is it?
- 20 zloty.

496
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:04,778
That's much too expensive, I'm sorry.

497
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:06,723
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

498
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:13,591
We'll take these stamps.
- How much?

499
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,485
Eight zloty 75.

500
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,436
Goodbye, gentlemen. Come again.

501
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,500
<i>Professor Alexander Siletzki
- arrives in two days.</i>

502
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,060
<i>Monitor Railway station.
Gestapo cannot reach-otherwise</i>

503
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,300
<i>catastrophe. Take in
contact as soon as possible.</i>

504
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:41,496
Yes, can I help you gentlemen?

505
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:45,171
We are looking for Mrs. Maria Tura.
- I am Mrs. Tura.

506
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,530
You have to come along with us.

507
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,621
I haven't done anything.
Why do they want me?

508
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:51,204
Just come along. Let's go.

509
00:35:26,462 --> 00:35:28,009
205, 206.

510
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:31,899
Mrs. Tura is here, sir.

511
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:34,471
Yes, sir.

512
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:37,673
Let her wait in 206.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:09,476
Good evening, Mrs. Tura.

514
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:11,635
Good evening.
- I'm Professor Siletsky.

515
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,351
It's a great pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Tura.

516
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:17,056
Won't you sit down?

517
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:24,866
Cigarette?
- Thank you.

518
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:32,295
I really must apologize for the manner
in which you were brought here.

519
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:34,719
When a man wants to see a lady
so badly...

520
00:36:34,722 --> 00:36:37,795
he backs up his invitation with bane.
It's rather flattering.

521
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:39,030
That's very well put.

522
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,975
As a matter of fact, I'm not responsible
for your being brought here at all.

523
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,310
There's a charming young
man in England...

524
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,492
Gave me a message for you.

525
00:36:47,064 --> 00:36:48,266
A rather strange message.

526
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:50,493
"To be or not to be."

527
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,148
You, no doubt know
its deeper meaning.

528
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,777
Yes, I have a vague idea.

529
00:36:54,851 --> 00:36:55,954
I really...

530
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,663
Will you forgive me, please?

531
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:05,401
Hello? Yes?

532
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,914
How do you do,
Colonel Ehrhardt?

533
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:12,053
Yes, the trip was a little bumpy...

534
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:14,933
but I'm certainly glad that you sent
that plane to Sweden. Otherwise...

535
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:17,629
Whenever you wish, of course.

536
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,100
10:00 tomorrow morning
at Gestapo Headquarters

537
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,340
unless I hear from you tonight.

538
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:23,764
Very well.

539
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:25,479
I'm looking forward
to making your acquaintance.

540
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:27,911
Goodbye, Colonel.

541
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,313
I'm sorry.
- Well, I won't keep you any longer.

542
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,812
Thank you for the charming message.

543
00:37:33,053 --> 00:37:36,472
- Mrs. Tura, you're an actress, aren't you?
- Yes.

544
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,598
Naturally, in the theater it's important
that you choose the right part.

545
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:40,777
Very.

546
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,878
But in real life, it's even more important
that you choose the right side.

547
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,023
The right side?

548
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:49,209
What is the right side?

549
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,469
The winning side.

550
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:53,708
I don't quite understand.

551
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:56,763
Here in Warsaw, there are a lot of people...

552
00:37:56,745 --> 00:37:58,559
that we know very well
and a lot of people...

553
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:01,562
that we don't know quite so well and
would like to know a great deal better.

554
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:03,612
That's where you can help us, Mrs. Tura.

555
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:06,995
You want me to be a spy?

556
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:09,588
Now, come, that's rather a crude word.

557
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:11,861
I once played a spy,
it was a great success.

558
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,585
I had wonderful notices.
It was really an exciting part.

559
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:16,735
Wouldn't it be exciting
to play it in real life?

560
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:19,504
I got shot in the last act.
I suppose that happens to most spies.

561
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,228
My dear Mrs. Tura,
we would never dream of

562
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:24,273
subjecting anybody as
charming as you to danger.

563
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,968
All you'd have to do
would be to entertain a little.

564
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,178
For instance, invite certain people...

565
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:32,369
I can see myself giving a great banquet
in my one-room mansion.

566
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:34,381
Of course, they took my lovely
apartment away from me.

567
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:36,975
I assure you that can be
very easily remedied.

568
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:39,245
Life could be made...

569
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,624
very comfortable for
you again, Mrs. Tura.

570
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,017
Well. What do you say?

571
00:38:46,798 --> 00:38:50,592
Naturally, it's all very attractive
and tempting.

572
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,637
But what are we going to do
about my conscience?

573
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,343
We've simply got to convince you
that you're going to serve the right cause.

574
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:59,740
I wonder if you really know
what Nazism stands for.

575
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,313
I have a slight idea.

576
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:04,513
In the final analysis, all we're trying to do
is create a happy world.

577
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,297
People who don't want to be happy
have no place in this happy world.

578
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,415
That makes sense.

579
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,581
We're not brutal,
we're not monsters.

580
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:13,661
Tell me...do I look like a monster?

581
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,328
Of course not, Professor.

582
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:18,687
You say that as though
you really meant it.

583
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:21,090
I do.
- We're just like other people.

584
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,664
We love to sing, we love to dance...

585
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,943
We admire beautiful women.

586
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:29,409
We're human. And sometimes...

587
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:32,673
- very human.
- I'm convinced of that.

588
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:37,369
Why don't you stay here for dinner?
I can imagine nothing more charming.

589
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:41,468
And before the evening is over,
I'm sure you'll say, "Heil Hitler."

590
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:44,153
I would like to accept your invitation,

591
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:47,177
but just as you want to represent
the Nazi case in the very best light...

592
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:51,033
I would like to represent the Polish case
in a more suitable dress.

593
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:54,007
I understand perfectly.
Please don't let me wait too long.

594
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,328
Au revoir.
- Just a moment.

595
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,441
I'm looking forward to it.
- So am I.

596
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:04,744
This lady is permitted to leave.
- Yes, sir.

597
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,259
This is a very difficult place to get in,
but it's much more difficult to get out.

598
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:13,046
I'm terribly frightened
and terribly thrilled.

599
00:40:13,053 --> 00:40:14,092
Bye.
- Bye.

600
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:47,071
"To be or not to be."

601
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:03,093
I'm feeling much better.

602
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:05,871
I'm glad at that.
Who are you? How did you get here?

603
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:08,915
Parachute. I jumped from a plane.

604
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:11,966
Right into my bed?
How did you get into my apartment?

605
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,950
Your wife...
Isn't she back? I'm getting worried.

606
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,683
You're worried? I'm worried!

607
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,328
Not so loud, you
might endanger all of us.

608
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,064
After all, we're all in the same boat.
- Oh, the same boat?

609
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:23,948
Then let me ask you something
as one sailor to another:

610
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:27,178
What ill-wind blew you
into my slippers?

611
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,116
Siletsky is here!
- What?!

612
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,590
At the Hotel "Europe".
Just when I came to

613
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:32,685
the book store, they took me to him.

614
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:34,609
What'd you do at the book store?
- I warned them against Siletsky!

615
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,785
Siletsky here. Then everything's over.

616
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:38,107
There's still one little chance,
Siletsky hasn't seen the Gestapo.

617
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,366
Well, not untill morning.
- We have to get to him.

618
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:42,942
That's impossible. It's like an
armed camp. Soldiers everywhere.

619
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:44,200
Why did he send for you?
Does he know I'm here?

620
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,249
No, but believe or not, he wants
me to become a Nazi spy.

621
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,061
Who wants you to become a Nazi spy?
- Siletsky.

622
00:42:48,113 --> 00:42:49,538
Who is Siletsky?
- A spy!

623
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:51,044
And who is he?
- Lieutenant Sobinski.

624
00:42:51,137 --> 00:42:51,891
What are you doing here?

625
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:54,510
What does that matter?
Don't you understand? Siletsky's here.

626
00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:56,548
It's unbelievable!

627
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,801
I come home to find a man
in the same boat with me...

628
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,516
and my wife says,
"What does it matter?"

629
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,355
But Mr. Tura, it's a zero hour.

630
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:05,197
You simply don't want me to waste time
giving you a long explanation.

631
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:07,249
No, but I think a husband is
entitled to an inkling.

632
00:43:07,258 --> 00:43:09,994
All right. Siletsky wants me to have
dinner with him...

633
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:12,080
and if we don't get another idea,
I hate to think but,

634
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:14,675
maybe I'll have to kill him myself,
because only I can get to him.

635
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:16,074
You see, this all wouldn't
have happened

636
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:17,738
if Lieutenant arrived
before Siletsky.

637
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:20,660
But they sent a plane for Siletsky,
so he arrived before the Lieutenant.

638
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:22,130
Now, is that clear?
- No.

639
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:24,151
So, You're gonna have dinner with him?
That's our only chance!

640
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:24,947
Wait a minute.

641
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:27,498
I'll decide with whom my wife has dinner
and whom she'll kill.

642
00:43:27,484 --> 00:43:28,829
Don't you realize, Poland's at stake?

643
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,174
Have you no patriotism?

644
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:31,609
Now, listen you...

645
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:33,876
First, you walk out of my soliloquy,
and then you walk into my slippers.

646
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,671
And now you question my patriotism.

647
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:38,123
I'm a good Pole.
I love my country and my slippers!

648
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:40,260
I hope your country comes first.
- So do I!

649
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:42,171
This is an emergency...
- Look...

650
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:43,968
I don't know much about
the whole thing,

651
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,274
but is this Siletsky a
real danger to Poland?

652
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:48,110
A catastrophe!
- He must be taken care of.

653
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:50,457
And he will be taken care of.
- Who's going to do it?

654
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,360
I'm going to do it.
- But how? - Where?

655
00:43:53,394 --> 00:43:56,402
I'm going to meet Herr Siletsky
at Gestapo Headquarters.

656
00:43:57,209 --> 00:44:00,379
And after I've killed him,
I hope you tell me what it was all about.

657
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:12,400
It took a bit longer than I thought,
I wonder if the effect was worth it.

658
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:15,127
I'm willing to die for our
Fuhrer at any moment.

659
00:44:15,635 --> 00:44:18,865
Except for the next few hours.
- Thank you, Professor.

660
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:22,832
The last time I wore this gown...
It seems like ages.

661
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:25,729
And I haven't seen such food.
Caviar, it still exists.

662
00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:28,004
Yes. On the winning side.

663
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:31,304
I must admit, you put some very
convincing arguments on this table.

664
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:33,993
It's nice being here, Professor.

665
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,394
I ordered a buffet. We don't want to be
interrupted by orderlies.

666
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,496
Naturally. After all, this isn't a fair State.

667
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:44,076
The best thing is to start
your training as an agent...

668
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:45,481
with a glass of champagne.

669
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,602
Shall we drink to a Blitzkrieg?

670
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:52,557
I prefer a slow encirclement.

671
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,639
You know, Professor,
I'm a little scared of you.

672
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:01,559
But why? You shouldn't be.

673
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,592
Maybe not. Maybe there's something
very gentle under that beard of yours.

674
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:08,980
I think you might have a boyish quality,
and yet I don't know.

675
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:12,070
Why don't you find out?
- I will.

676
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:20,029
Here, write your name
and I'll tell you everything about you.

677
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:22,542
The first time I saw
my husband's handwriting...

678
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:24,328
was on the marriage certificate,
then it was too late.

679
00:45:24,392 --> 00:45:26,777
If you prefer... I'm
taking an awful chance.

680
00:45:26,878 --> 00:45:29,673
But remember, if a fortune-teller
wants to stay in business...

681
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:32,504
she must only tell her client
what he really wants to hear.

682
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:43,714
Professor, if I'd known you made an "S"
like that, I wouldn't have come here.

683
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:47,476
You're a very determined man.
- Yes. Very.

684
00:45:48,935 --> 00:45:51,282
But you have great charm, yes.

685
00:45:53,054 --> 00:45:55,748
I only hope you live up
to that "Y," Professor.

686
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:57,176
You'll see.

687
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:08,661
Heil Hitler.

688
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:10,970
Heil Hitler.

689
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:20,405
Heil Hitler.

690
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:22,410
I am Capt. Muhm,
Colonel Ehrhardt's staff.

691
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:25,165
Please, come in.

692
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:28,547
Just a moment.

693
00:46:38,147 --> 00:46:40,926
I'm sorry, there's been
a change in Colonel Ehrhardt's plans.

694
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:42,239
He'd like to see you immediately.

695
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,508
Yes, of course.

696
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:46,768
I'll be with you in a minute.

697
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:53,157
I'm so sorry.
- Don't tell me you have to leave.

698
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:54,792
Yes, but I'll make it as quickly as possible.

699
00:46:55,118 --> 00:46:58,358
That's terrible. I came up here
with such doubts in my mind...

700
00:46:58,343 --> 00:47:01,075
and now you're going to leave me here
just as the cause is getting me.

701
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:18,111
I won't be long.

702
00:47:18,817 --> 00:47:21,493
Gestapo is so busy these days,
I'm sure they'll be glad to get rid of me.

703
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,389
I'm so sorry.
- Well, it can't be helped.

704
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:28,487
Just a moment.
What's your name?

705
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:31,583
Mrs. Tura.
- Whom were you visiting?

706
00:48:31,697 --> 00:48:33,341
Professor Siletsky.

707
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:36,975
I'm sorry. Professor
left no instructions.

708
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:38,171
You'll have to wait until
he comes back.

709
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:39,439
But that's impossible.

710
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:40,911
Sorry. There is nothing I can do about it.

711
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:42,810
206. - Yes, sir.

712
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,440
Yes, sir.

713
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,198
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

714
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:38,090
Wait one moment, I'll announce you
to Colonel Ehrhardt.

715
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:38,817
Thank you very much.

716
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,033
Goodbye, Colonel.

717
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,210
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

718
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,358
Isn't this the gentleman
from England, Captain?

719
00:49:46,425 --> 00:49:49,082
Yes, General. - It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Professor.

720
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:50,892
A very great pleasure.

721
00:49:51,216 --> 00:49:54,094
You certainly fooled the English,
didn't you?

722
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,300
The British lion will drink his tea...

723
00:49:57,455 --> 00:49:59,954
from saucers made in Germany.

724
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:09,589
<i>Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

725
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,602
How did he ever become a general?

726
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:16,625
He's Göring's brother-in-law.

727
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,875
I'll announce you to the Colonel.
- Thank you.

728
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,806
He brought the papers with him.

729
00:50:26,975 --> 00:50:28,846
Now remember.
Who were his helpers in England?

730
00:50:28,954 --> 00:50:30,778
Soon as you find out call me,
I'll do the rest. - All right.

731
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:33,127
Now look Tura, you're playing for our lives.
- I know.

732
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,219
I'm going to do the impossible.
I'm going to surpass myself.

733
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:40,174
Don't. Take it easy and don't draw out
the scene please. Come on, let's go.

734
00:50:40,657 --> 00:50:43,313
I hate to leave the fate of my country
in the hands of a ham.

735
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:47,617
Send him in.

736
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,745
Professor, please.
- Thank you.

737
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:55,798
<i>Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

738
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,564
Professor Siletsky, I'm glad to see you.

739
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:00,612
And I'm glad to see you, too.

740
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,342
Sit down, please.
- Thank you very much.

741
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:04,464
I can't tell you how delighted
we are to have you.

742
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:06,658
May I say, my dear Colonel,
that it's good

743
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,578
to breathe the air of
the Gestapo again.

744
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:12,080
You know, you're quiet famous
in London, Colonel.

745
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:14,650
They call you
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.

746
00:51:14,702 --> 00:51:18,467
Yes. We do the concentrating,
and the Poles do the camping.

747
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:24,254
Yes, indeed. Well, here's the report...

748
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,491
and that's the end
of the underground movement.

749
00:51:27,894 --> 00:51:29,311
Let's see this.

750
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:31,493
Excellent. Excellent.

751
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:33,970
They're as good as dead.

752
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:40,053
I assume, there are no supplementary
documents still at the hotel.

753
00:51:40,393 --> 00:51:43,302
No, that covers everything.
- Good.

754
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:46,389
And I'm sending the duplicate to Berlin
the first thing in the morning.

755
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,819
The duplicate?
Yes, of course, the duplicate.

756
00:51:51,011 --> 00:51:55,004
If you ask me, it's a lot of red tape.
But since they want it, well, all right.

757
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,267
Naturally. You know, Professor...

758
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:59,823
Warsaw is a dangerous place these days.

759
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:03,029
But I suppose you have the papers
in the hotel safe?

760
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:06,849
No, they're locked in my trunk.
The whole hotel is a safe.

761
00:52:06,986 --> 00:52:09,544
Yes, of course. Naturally.

762
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,419
I want to get the machinery started
on this report right away.

763
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:14,054
I'll be back in a moment.
- Very well.

764
00:52:19,295 --> 00:52:22,539
All right, I'll get this wrapped up.
- No. He still has papers in his trunk.

765
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:24,048
Papers in his trunk?

766
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:25,901
I'll kill that dirty dog any how.

767
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,776
How are we going to
get into his hotel?

768
00:52:28,764 --> 00:52:30,704
Get back there and keep him there.
We'll try to figure something out.

769
00:52:30,701 --> 00:52:31,340
Alright.

770
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,016
Colonel, is there anything else
you want to ask me?

771
00:52:40,065 --> 00:52:41,864
Lots. Sit down, Professor.

772
00:52:42,073 --> 00:52:44,198
There are many things
I want to ask you.

773
00:52:45,883 --> 00:52:46,856
So many things.

774
00:52:47,075 --> 00:52:49,735
Anything you want to know,
I'd only be too happy to oblige.

775
00:52:49,721 --> 00:52:50,382
Thank you.

776
00:52:54,194 --> 00:52:56,375
So they call me
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt?

777
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:01,558
Yes. You know, Professor...

778
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:03,067
there's something I
wanted to ask you.

779
00:53:03,064 --> 00:53:04,034
Yes?

780
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,249
That's the way it is.
A thousand questions on your mind...

781
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,728
yet you can't think of anything to ask.

782
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:15,302
But it will crystallize.

783
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:18,109
Maybe there's something
you like to ask me?

784
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:20,497
No, I can't think of anything, Colonel.

785
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,605
So they call me
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.

786
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:34,657
Well. Excuse me a minute,
I'll be right back.

787
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,727
I'm running out of dialogue.
- We got it.

788
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,024
Here, check this gun.
Put it in your pocket.

789
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,293
Now, you take him
back to the hotel.

790
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:48,275
As soon as you're in his room,
hit his head with the butt of the gun.

791
00:53:48,409 --> 00:53:50,757
Then, take his keys, open his
trunk and burn the papers.

792
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:54,284
And then you shoot him.
- All right. Just a minute.

793
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:56,072
What'll happen to me? They'll kill me.

794
00:53:56,228 --> 00:53:58,864
We're going to keep our fingers crossed.
- Good.

795
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:00,514
Wait a minute.

796
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,550
You go to the hotel
and I'll cross my fingers.

797
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:04,119
Here, think of something else.

798
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,878
So they really call me
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt?

799
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:13,714
Colonel, unless there's something urgent,
I'd like to relax a little.

800
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:18,033
Relax? Oh, Mrs. Tura.

801
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,287
Tell me, how is Mrs. Tura?
Sit down, Professor.

802
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:24,799
You see, my Gestapo men
are very efficient.

803
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:28,590
I simply thought she might be
of some value to us as an agent.

804
00:54:28,684 --> 00:54:31,031
And besides that,
she's very good company.

805
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,071
Very good company?

806
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,892
Colonel, if you'd like to meet Mrs. Tura,
I'd be glad to introduce you.

807
00:54:37,176 --> 00:54:38,657
Well, thank you.

808
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:40,731
And if you should happen
to take a liking to the lady...

809
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:42,548
Maybe you'll even put in
a good word for me?

810
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:44,346
I'd be delighted.

811
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:47,441
Well, thank you.
Thank you.

812
00:54:48,293 --> 00:54:51,776
Tell me, hasn't she a husband?
- Yes, but what does it matter?

813
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,043
Yes, what does it?

814
00:54:53,363 --> 00:54:57,316
By the way, I believe her husband
is that great Polish actor...

815
00:54:57,384 --> 00:54:59,231
Joseph Tura.
Of course, you've heard of him?

816
00:54:59,387 --> 00:55:00,804
No, I haven't.

817
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,207
As a matter of fact, I never even heard
of Maria Tura before, either.

818
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,106
You didn't?
Then how did you get in touch with her?

819
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:09,610
It's rather a delicate story.

820
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:12,406
There's a young Polish flier in England.

821
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,569
I think his name is Sobinski.

822
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,476
Asked me to deliver a
message to her.

823
00:55:17,476 --> 00:55:19,629
Well, that's very interesting.

824
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:20,517
What was the message?

825
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,837
I had to swear to this young Romeo
not to tell the husband.

826
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:25,759
That gives you a rough idea
of the message.

827
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:27,014
Yes.

828
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:30,765
It is a little rough.
- Seems they have a secret love code.

829
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:35,543
Am I boring you?
- No, I find it very interesting.

830
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:38,792
This young flier gave me the message,
and I couldn't make head nor tail of it...

831
00:55:38,775 --> 00:55:41,862
and neither will you. But Mrs. Tura
seemed to understand it perfectly.

832
00:55:41,847 --> 00:55:43,704
Well, what was the message?

833
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:47,223
"To be or not to be."
- To be...

834
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,970
To be or not to be!
- Colonel, it's nothing alarming.

835
00:55:51,972 --> 00:55:53,940
It's only Shakespeare.
- That's what you think.

836
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:56,310
Professor Siletsky, you amaze me.

837
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:59,503
You, a Gestapo man, bringing a message
to a Polish woman from the enemy.

838
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,295
And when I say enemy,
I mean enemy!

839
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:04,751
You think they had a romance?

840
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:07,589
I couldn't swear to it,
but I don't doubt it. Do you?

841
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:11,002
No! And I'm going to find out
if I have to mobilize the whole Gestapo.

842
00:56:11,074 --> 00:56:13,032
But, Colonel, I don't understand...

843
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:16,258
suppose these two did have a romance,
that's nothing you have to worry about.

844
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,686
The only person that has to worry
is the husband. That's all.

845
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:21,715
And that's enough!
I'm going to arrest this Maria Tura.

846
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:32,644
I guess you're right, Professor.
I've been with the Gestapo so long...

847
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:35,010
I get suspicious of everyone.
- And so do I.

848
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:41,019
So they call me
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.

849
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:46,969
Coming back to Mrs. Tura.
- Let's forget about her.

850
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,831
There's nothing mysterious about her,
she's just a cheap, little...

851
00:56:51,117 --> 00:56:52,416
I think I know what you mean.

852
00:56:54,396 --> 00:56:56,027
Then I don't have to say it, do I?

853
00:57:00,306 --> 00:57:03,001
Do you mind if I'm repetitious,
Colonel Ehrhardt?

854
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,943
Why? No, not at all.

855
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:07,132
As I said before, Colonel Ehrhardt...

856
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:10,738
the only one that has to worry
about all this is the lady's husband.

857
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:15,198
That great Polish actor,
Joseph Tura.

858
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:19,007
Well, that's none of my concern.
- But it should be, Mr. Tura.

859
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:20,990
Raise your hands.
Quickly, please.

860
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,338
Did you ever play a corpse, Mr. Tura?

861
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,546
What?

862
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:27,287
You're going to be one
unless you do exactly as I say.

863
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:30,306
Get to the door and tell your friends
to clear away from there.

864
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:31,556
I won't do it.

865
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,799
Turn around.

866
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:35,889
Get over there and face that wall.

867
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,750
Now, stay there.

868
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:45,481
Sure you won't change your mind?

869
00:57:46,157 --> 00:57:47,715
I'll give you one more chance.

870
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,815
Farewell, Mr. Tura.

871
00:57:52,657 --> 00:57:54,366
Long live Poland!

872
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:01,200
- What happened?
- I don't know, he must have gone out.

873
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:47,379
There he is!

874
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,666
Get him!

875
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,809
Get backstage. Raise the curtain.

876
00:59:35,279 --> 00:59:36,923
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

877
00:59:37,256 --> 00:59:40,166
Professor Siletsky?
- Professor Siletsky isn't here.

878
00:59:40,397 --> 00:59:43,058
You expect him back?
- Yes, certainly.

879
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:45,779
Do you mind if I wait here
for the Professor?

880
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:47,257
No, not at all.

881
00:59:47,433 --> 00:59:48,472
Thank you.

882
01:00:14,805 --> 01:00:18,289
Good night, Professor Siletsky.
- Good night.

883
01:00:25,106 --> 01:00:27,670
Good night, Professor.
- Good night.

884
01:00:41,106 --> 01:00:43,421
Professor Siletsky?
- Yes?

885
01:00:43,675 --> 01:00:45,417
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

886
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:47,979
I'm Capt. Schultz
of Colonel Ehrhardt's staff.

887
01:00:48,024 --> 01:00:50,459
Well, I'm glad to meet you, Captain.

888
01:00:51,154 --> 01:00:53,209
Mrs. Tura.

889
01:00:56,842 --> 01:00:59,060
I thought you had left, madame.

890
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:01,744
You forgot to leave word for me
to get out...

891
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:03,558
But now I don't regret
that I've waited.

892
01:01:04,142 --> 01:01:06,456
And how is Professor Siletsky?

893
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:10,640
Dead. Absolutely dead.

894
01:01:11,628 --> 01:01:13,420
I had to take care of some business.

895
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,701
How about a glass of champagne?

896
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,185
No, thank you. I don't drink.

897
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,565
Cigarette?
- Thank you. I don't smoke.

898
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,887
Just like our Fuhrer.
- Yes.

899
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:24,541
Well, Captain, I'm terribly sorry
to have kept you waiting.

900
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:28,076
I tried to entertain the Captain,
but he seems to be the suspicious type.

901
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:30,467
I admit I was a little surprised
when I came in.

902
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:31,840
And I don't blame you.

903
01:01:32,115 --> 01:01:35,469
Here the whole Gestapo has been working
for a long time, day and night...

904
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,799
trying to find out every little thing
about everybody...

905
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,010
and I arrive, and in a few hours

906
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,023
I find the most attractive lady in town.

907
01:01:42,195 --> 01:01:43,872
You didn't know madame before?

908
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:47,800
Well, no. Not exactly.
But the explanation is very simple.

909
01:01:48,243 --> 01:01:51,283
I just asked Mrs. Tura here
to deliver a message.

910
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:54,292
- Isn't that right?
- Yes. Yes!

911
01:01:55,013 --> 01:01:58,659
There's a young flier,
a very good friend of the Turas...

912
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:01,808
and particularly of Mrs. Tura.
Isn't that right?

913
01:02:02,027 --> 01:02:05,080
Yes. But he's no particular
friend of mine.

914
01:02:05,134 --> 01:02:08,963
Nevertheless, a friend.
It was a code message.

915
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:10,137
Code message?

916
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:13,445
Mrs. Tura has nothing to hide
from the Gestapo...

917
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:16,139
but she has one
tiny little secret.

918
01:02:18,753 --> 01:02:20,597
If her husband ever found out,
he would murder her.

919
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:24,535
By the way, he is that great
Polish actor, Joseph Tura.

920
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:26,946
You've probably heard of him?
- No, I haven't.

921
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,972
Professor, Colonel Ehrhardt...

922
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:32,452
Yes. I'm going to meet him promptly,
10:00 tomorrow morning.

923
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,667
There has been a change
in the Colonel's plans.

924
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:36,082
You're not going to take him away?

925
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:39,456
I'm sorry. But the Colonel is
expecting the Professor now.

926
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,421
Those are my orders.

927
01:02:42,368 --> 01:02:43,224
Now...

928
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:49,191
Well, it looks like I'll have to go.
Excuse me a moment.

929
01:02:55,884 --> 01:02:57,708
Sweetheart.

930
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:00,829
Darling.

931
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:04,421
Open the trunk.
Burn all the papers.

932
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:07,884
All right. What did you do with Siletsky?
- What did you do with Sobinski?

933
01:03:08,058 --> 01:03:10,208
That's unimportant now,
don't you realize...

934
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:11,726
you're going into the hands
of the Gestapo?

935
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,881
Yes, the scene is
loaded with dynamite.

936
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,679
One little slip and I'm a dead man.

937
01:03:16,267 --> 01:03:18,993
You know I'm never any good
unless I have my peace of mind.

938
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:22,388
Maria, be honest, be frank.
I've got to know.

939
01:03:23,164 --> 01:03:24,985
Did you tell that fellow
to walk out of my soliloquy?

940
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:28,348
Sweetheart, darling, I love you.

941
01:03:28,813 --> 01:03:31,651
Don't you know that? Don't you feel it?
If anything happened to you...

942
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:32,474
You think I can do it?

943
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:35,117
You're a great actor.
Nobody can play it but you.

944
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,044
You can, and you will do it.

945
01:03:37,419 --> 01:03:38,653
Goodbye, darling.

946
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,695
Goodbye.

947
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,113
If I shouldn't come back,

948
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,753
I forgive what happened
between you and Sobinski.

949
01:03:48,513 --> 01:03:50,082
But if I come back,
it's a different matter.

950
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:01,049
Yes?
- Heil Hitler.

951
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,186
Heil Hitler.
- Professor Siletsky is here.

952
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:03,953
Have him come in.

953
01:04:04,943 --> 01:04:06,999
Didn't you understand what I told you?

954
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,538
Did you arrest him? Why not?
You have no proof?

955
01:04:10,865 --> 01:04:14,576
Now, that's a fine excuse. Arrest him, too.
Whenever in doubt, arrest him.

956
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:17,876
How many times do I have to tell you,
arrest him? Heil Hitler.

957
01:04:17,963 --> 01:04:19,920
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

958
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:21,511
Professor, at last we meet.

959
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:24,063
Please make yourself at home.
Won't you take off your coat?

960
01:04:24,116 --> 01:04:25,430
Thank you. Thank you.

961
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:26,896
Colonel Ehrhardt...

962
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:31,864
I can't tell you how happy I am
to breathe the air of the Gestapo again.

963
01:04:32,038 --> 01:04:35,453
Thank you very much.
Cigarette, cigar, glass of brandy?

964
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:36,653
No, thank you.

965
01:04:36,724 --> 01:04:39,054
There was a sudden change
in my schedule.

966
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:40,786
Confidentially, big news.

967
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:44,062
A very old friend of yours is coming
to Warsaw. The Fuhrer.

968
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:47,072
I know you will be delighted
to see the Fuhrer again.

969
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,867
Who wouldn't?
- That's right.

970
01:04:50,225 --> 01:04:52,508
How long since you've
seen him, Professor?

971
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,288
Too long. Much too long.
- Of course.

972
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:00,623
Tell me, is Berchtesgarden
really as beautiful as they say it is?

973
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,252
Yes, I think I can say
that without any risk.

974
01:05:04,553 --> 01:05:07,085
But it isn't the architecture
or the landscaping...

975
01:05:07,259 --> 01:05:10,646
it's the presence of the Fuhrer
that lends the real beauty to the place.

976
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:15,168
Naturally. Well, what news
you bring from London?

977
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:20,005
London? Oh, yes, London.
Colonel, you're quiet famous in London.

978
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,145
You know what they call you?
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.

979
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:24,690
They do, do they?

980
01:05:26,675 --> 01:05:29,336
So they call me
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt.

981
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:33,862
I thought you would react just that way.

982
01:05:35,301 --> 01:05:37,553
Well, Professor,
let's have your information.

983
01:05:38,842 --> 01:05:41,751
I think I can stand
a glass of brandy, after all.

984
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,297
Certainly. Brandy.

985
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:48,342
That makes me think of a very funny story
which is going all over Warsaw.

986
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:51,892
A story about our Fuhrer.
Now, how does it go?

987
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,659
Yes. They named a brandy after Napoleon.

988
01:05:55,774 --> 01:05:57,548
They made a herring out of Bismarck.

989
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,291
And the Fuhrer's going to end up
as a piece of cheese.

990
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:05,963
Don't you think it's funny?

991
01:06:06,552 --> 01:06:08,360
No. Neither would the Fuhrer.

992
01:06:09,959 --> 01:06:13,411
I don't believe Adolf Hitler
will go down in history as a delicatessen.

993
01:06:13,543 --> 01:06:17,280
Professor, I was only joking,
just repeating what I heard.

994
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,106
After all, I'll never...
Please don't misunderstand me.

995
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,881
See, I'm loyal. Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

996
01:06:23,402 --> 01:06:26,160
Professor, do you intend to tell
the Fuhrer about this?

997
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,876
Why should I ruin you?
- Of course, that's very nice.

998
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:31,559
I can promise you the Fuhrer
will never hear it from my lips.

999
01:06:31,873 --> 01:06:33,977
My word of honor.
- Thank you.

1000
01:06:34,684 --> 01:06:38,514
Please, Professor, if you'd be so kind,
what about the underground movement?

1001
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:41,139
What exactly are your plans?
- You want to know?

1002
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:42,397
Yes, if you don't mind.

1003
01:06:43,056 --> 01:06:47,557
I have the key in my hand,
all I have to find is the lock.

1004
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,638
It's better having the lock than the key.
How does it sound?

1005
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,518
Promising. Most promising.

1006
01:06:52,063 --> 01:06:54,942
But tell me, what exactly
do you intend to do?

1007
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:58,217
Well, let's get down to details.
- Yes, if you please.

1008
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:00,893
There are no details. At least, not yet.

1009
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:02,565
The important thing is...

1010
01:07:02,673 --> 01:07:05,111
I have the name of the leader
of the whole underground movement.

1011
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:08,992
lf we play our cards right and carefully...
- I understand.

1012
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:11,893
If you watch the shepherd,
you're bound to find the flock.

1013
01:07:12,023 --> 01:07:14,587
What's the name of the shepherd?
- Boguslaw Revanski.

1014
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:17,768
Send Capt. Schultz in.

1015
01:07:19,891 --> 01:07:22,358
So, they call me
"Concentration Camp" Ehrhardt?

1016
01:07:27,738 --> 01:07:29,924
Capt. Schultz,
there's a man in this town...

1017
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:31,571
What's his name?
- Revanski.

1018
01:07:31,683 --> 01:07:33,425
You mean, Bogoslov Revanski?
- Yes.

1019
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:35,340
You don't have to worry about him.
- What?

1020
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:36,620
We shot him two days ago.

1021
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,846
Revanski shot? I refuse to believe it.

1022
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:41,050
Don't you realize
whom you shot, Capt. Schultz?

1023
01:07:41,097 --> 01:07:43,596
I risked mz life to get the key man
of the underground movement...

1024
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,634
and just when we were ready...
It's sabotage!

1025
01:07:46,725 --> 01:07:47,925
I resent that, Professor.

1026
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:48,950
Why did you shoot him?

1027
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:53,764
We have proof that this man was telling
some outrageous stories about the Fuhrer.

1028
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:56,014
That's no reason to shoot him.
- I agree with you.

1029
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:57,195
At least not right away.

1030
01:07:57,734 --> 01:07:59,430
So, you shot Revanski like that.

1031
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:01,176
Would it have been better
to look him over first?

1032
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:03,370
Why don't we look over people
before we shoot them?

1033
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:06,348
I'm sorry, but you signed
the order of execution yourself.

1034
01:08:06,353 --> 01:08:08,246
Oh, well, I sign so
many every day.

1035
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:10,479
I can't rely on my own people anymore.

1036
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:13,176
Please, Colonel, maybe we can
still save the situation.

1037
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:16,116
There's one other man.
A possibility. A good possibility.

1038
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,007
Maximilian Pietrowski.

1039
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:20,597
Maximilian Pietrowski?

1040
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:23,042
Don't tell me you...

1041
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:25,573
Yes.

1042
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:29,490
Colonel, all I can say is, you can't
have your cake and shoot it, too.

1043
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,563
It can't be done.

1044
01:08:30,657 --> 01:08:33,891
If they hear about this in England,
they'll give you the Victoria Cross.

1045
01:08:33,895 --> 01:08:35,845
I resent that, Professor.
- That's all, Schultz.

1046
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:37,099
Yes, sir.

1047
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:47,827
I didn't like the way Capt. Schultz
shifted the responsibility back to you.

1048
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:50,056
Neither did I. You know,
there's always something wrong

1049
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:52,263
with a man who doesn't drink,
doesn't smoke, or eat meat.

1050
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:54,821
You mean our Fuhrer?
- No, please, Professor.

1051
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:56,517
I hope you won't...
- Why should I ruin you again?

1052
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:57,769
Thank you so much.

1053
01:08:57,901 --> 01:09:00,638
I suppose you want to go back
as soon as possible to London.

1054
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:04,197
London? Yes, certainly.
- When did you plan to leave?

1055
01:09:04,294 --> 01:09:06,081
I'd like to get out as
soon as possible.

1056
01:09:06,056 --> 01:09:08,350
Under the circumstances,
that's best thing.

1057
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,458
We have a plane leaving
on Thursday for Sweden.

1058
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,492
I'll make a reservation for you.
- That's fine.

1059
01:09:12,502 --> 01:09:14,276
You better make that two
reservations. - Two?

1060
01:09:14,425 --> 01:09:16,557
See, my trip was successful
in one respect.

1061
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:17,727
I made a discovery.

1062
01:09:17,747 --> 01:09:19,228
A certain Mrs. Tura.

1063
01:09:19,427 --> 01:09:21,807
She'll be the most valuable assistant
in London I've ever had.

1064
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,811
Frankly, I don't believe
in women agents.

1065
01:09:23,824 --> 01:09:25,824
But you'll change your mind
if you meet Mrs. Tura.

1066
01:09:25,837 --> 01:09:27,514
Why don't you? Form
your own opinion.

1067
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:28,737
If you say "no," it's no.

1068
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:30,169
Alright. I'll call you at the hotel.

1069
01:09:30,183 --> 01:09:32,183
What was the lady's name?
- Mrs. Tura.

1070
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:36,445
Her husband is that great
Polish actor, Joseph Tura.

1071
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,387
You've probably heard of him?
- Yes.

1072
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:41,400
As in matter of fact, I saw him on the stage

1073
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:43,215
when I was in Warsaw,
once before the War.

1074
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:43,950
Really?

1075
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:46,552
What he did to Shakespeare,
we are doing now to Poland.

1076
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:49,831
Goodbye, Colonel.
- Goodbye, Professor.

1077
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,540
Group leader Ehrhardt
1941. Tuesday, 16. December

1078
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,300
10:30 Maria Tura

1079
01:10:07,438 --> 01:10:10,198
I'm Colonel Ehrhardt.
Will you sit down, please?

1080
01:10:11,887 --> 01:10:14,602
Mrs. Tura, I sent for you.
- And I'm very grateful.

1081
01:10:14,592 --> 01:10:17,981
I can't make up my mind. Yes,
it sounds very intriguing and exciting...

1082
01:10:17,989 --> 01:10:20,553
Mrs. Tura, I have bad news for you.

1083
01:10:20,686 --> 01:10:22,611
Well, naturally, If you don't think
I'm the right person...

1084
01:10:22,601 --> 01:10:24,773
it will be disappointing,
but the cause must come first.

1085
01:10:24,806 --> 01:10:28,388
No, Mrs. Tura. It isn't that.
Prepare yourself for a shock.

1086
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:30,488
Professor Siletsky is dead.

1087
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,283
Dead?
- Murdered.

1088
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:40,040
I can't believe it. It can't be.

1089
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:43,886
When did this happen?
- We haven't found out yet.

1090
01:10:43,918 --> 01:10:46,039
I only got the report just now.

1091
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:49,927
Was it at the hotel? - No. He was
evidently trapped somewhere.

1092
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:52,521
The Fuhrer has just arrived in Warsaw.

1093
01:10:52,523 --> 01:10:54,648
The men are planning a great
reception for him tonight.

1094
01:10:54,652 --> 01:10:56,426
A kind of performance by the soldiers.

1095
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:59,874
They opened the Theatre Polski.
They tried to arrange some scenery.

1096
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:03,285
One of the props broke and out fell
the body of Professor Siletsky.

1097
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:06,227
Who could have done such a thing?
Do you have any idea?

1098
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:07,421
We are pretty certain.

1099
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:10,786
You see, the bullet found in his body
came from a British service revolver.

1100
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:13,303
Yesterday, the British landed
someone here by parachute.

1101
01:11:13,331 --> 01:11:15,672
So the only mystery left is,
where is this man?

1102
01:11:15,786 --> 01:11:17,391
Believe me, we're going to get him.

1103
01:11:17,543 --> 01:11:20,237
Well, I hope so.
- My poor Professor.

1104
01:11:20,838 --> 01:11:22,763
I had an appointment with him
this afternoon.

1105
01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:23,964
He was due here any minute.

1106
01:11:25,465 --> 01:11:28,517
Thank you very much. I won't take up
any more of your time. Goodbye.

1107
01:11:28,503 --> 01:11:31,640
Mrs. Tura, I want you to know
that your ties with us are not broken.

1108
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:34,732
After all, you might be very valuable to us.
- Thank you.

1109
01:11:34,867 --> 01:11:38,449
It doesn't have to be London.
I might have something here in Warsaw.

1110
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:40,559
Colonel, whatever you decide,
if you want me...

1111
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:42,431
Naturally, I would have to know you
a little better.

1112
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:45,606
That is my duty
and if I may say, my pleasure.

1113
01:11:45,674 --> 01:11:47,011
That's nice of you, Colonel.

1114
01:11:46,995 --> 01:11:49,148
But at the moment...
- It doesn't have to be today.

1115
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:52,331
When you feel a little better,
maybe we can have dinner together.

1116
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,174
Why don't you let me know?
- I will.

1117
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,358
And don't take it too hard,
little woman.

1118
01:11:57,029 --> 01:11:59,181
I'll try not to.
- That's the spirit.

1119
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:06,263
Mrs. Tura seems to be rather upset.

1120
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:09,667
Naturally, it's very unfortunate
what happened to Siletsky.

1121
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,335
After all, he died for the Fuhrer.
- Naturally.

1122
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:17,630
Hello. Good morning,
Professor Siletsky. I have...

1123
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:24,999
You will be a little late.

1124
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:27,189
Yes.

1125
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:30,341
Yes, I understand.

1126
01:12:39,252 --> 01:12:41,912
Will you please announce me
to Professor Siletsky?

1127
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:46,498
The Professor left quite a while ago.
- He did? Thank you.

1128
01:12:51,203 --> 01:12:52,620
Was Tura here?
- Yeah.

1129
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:54,531
Did he say anything?
- No, he just rushed in...

1130
01:12:54,515 --> 01:12:56,252
punched me in the jaw,
and rushed out.

1131
01:13:19,156 --> 01:13:21,809
Dobosh, you know what happened?
- Yes. It's all right, Joseph just left.

1132
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:23,154
What do you mean?
- Well, he had some trouble.

1133
01:13:23,176 --> 01:13:24,554
Somebody must have grabbed his beard.

1134
01:13:24,544 --> 01:13:26,880
Don't worry, I fixed it up and
gave him an extra beard.

1135
01:13:26,887 --> 01:13:28,500
Just in case. You never can't
tell with Tura.

1136
01:13:28,757 --> 01:13:30,714
He's lost. They found the body in
the theater. They know everything.

1137
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:32,228
What?! - What did you say?

1138
01:13:32,216 --> 01:13:33,667
Who opened the theater?
- The Nazis.

1139
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:36,231
Who gave them the key?
- You idiot you, you shut up!

1140
01:13:36,259 --> 01:13:39,425
They're gonna kill him.
You've got to do something. Help him.

1141
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:40,686
Rawitch, do something.

1142
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:44,630
Everything is all right.

1143
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,877
The Professor is here.
- We will be delighted.

1144
01:13:50,738 --> 01:13:52,349
Professor, please.

1145
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,397
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. How is the Professor?

1146
01:13:57,426 --> 01:13:59,991
- Fine, thank you. How is the Colonel?
- Excellent. May I?

1147
01:14:00,164 --> 01:14:02,891
Tell me, Colonel, what was
your impression of Mrs. Tura?

1148
01:14:02,956 --> 01:14:05,136
Wonderful.
- I'm glad you feel that way.

1149
01:14:05,123 --> 01:14:05,920
Yes, indeed.

1150
01:14:06,194 --> 01:14:09,944
This is Capt. Mueller and Lt. Brundt
of our Special Investigation Squad.

1151
01:14:09,927 --> 01:14:11,605
Or what we call the Hotfoot Department.

1152
01:14:11,673 --> 01:14:13,545
How do you do?
- It's a pleasure.

1153
01:14:13,609 --> 01:14:15,633
How do u do? - How do u do?
It's a pleasure, I'm sure.

1154
01:14:15,654 --> 01:14:18,472
Professor, I think we should
have a good talk before you leave.

1155
01:14:18,473 --> 01:14:20,182
I have to take up a few things
with these gentlemen.

1156
01:14:20,187 --> 01:14:22,519
Would you mind stepping into
my living room?

1157
01:15:23,555 --> 01:15:25,363
He should have cracked by now.

1158
01:15:25,615 --> 01:15:28,243
Give him a little time.
Let him enjoy his goose pimples.

1159
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:32,316
Colonel, do you really prefer
this procedure to our usual methods?

1160
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:35,908
I would say with intellectuals,
the mental approach is more effective...

1161
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:36,984
and much quicker.

1162
01:15:37,011 --> 01:15:39,639
But if he shouldn't turn out
to be an intellectual?

1163
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,206
Then we try a little physical culture.

1164
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:49,454
I don't want to hurry you,
but do you think it will be much longer?

1165
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,638
Did you get bored?
- No, I tried to open up a conversation...

1166
01:15:53,641 --> 01:15:56,139
with your friend in there,
but he seems to be dead.

1167
01:15:56,495 --> 01:15:59,059
No. Really. Let's go and see.

1168
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:04,133
It looks like murder.

1169
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:08,476
If I'm wrong, Colonel,
please correct me.

1170
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:12,548
There seems to be a slight resemblance
between me and your late friend.

1171
01:16:12,696 --> 01:16:16,099
Has that struck you, too?
- Definitely.

1172
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,023
I have a terrible suspicion
that one of us must be an impostor.

1173
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,201
Now that you mention it,
I think you're right.

1174
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:26,014
Now, just for fun, Colonel, which one of
us do you think is the impostor?

1175
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:28,695
I hope you won't
consider it impolite, Professor...

1176
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:32,503
but there's a general feeling in this room
that it's you. Please forgive me.

1177
01:16:32,508 --> 01:16:34,314
Certainly. You mind if I play detective?

1178
01:16:34,315 --> 01:16:36,121
Go right ahead, Professor Siletsky.

1179
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:37,290
Thank you.

1180
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:42,911
Edmondson's London.
- The real Siletsky came from London.

1181
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:44,109
The suit was bought in London.

1182
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:46,830
You think it looks bad for me?
- Terrible.

1183
01:16:49,488 --> 01:16:51,100
His watch is still running.

1184
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:55,503
Which means he was killed, since the real
Professor Siletsky arrived in...

1185
01:16:55,776 --> 01:16:58,177
This really looks bad for me.
I'm liable to get shot.

1186
01:16:58,189 --> 01:16:59,662
There's a distinct possibility.

1187
01:16:59,978 --> 01:17:02,705
There's no doubt
there was a definite purpose.

1188
01:17:03,013 --> 01:17:06,040
He wanted to look like me...
- Or you wanted to look like him.

1189
01:17:06,634 --> 01:17:07,993
That's right.

1190
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:12,481
Our hair is cut alike and even the shape
of our beards is somewhat similar.

1191
01:17:12,483 --> 01:17:14,132
Not similar. Exactly alike.

1192
01:17:14,345 --> 01:17:16,908
How long did you know each other?
- I just meet him here.

1193
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:18,440
Now you're lying. Plain lying.

1194
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:20,122
You must have observed him
for several months.

1195
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:21,863
It takes that long to grow
a beard of that kind.

1196
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:26,096
Very good, Schultz.
- Excellent, Schultz.

1197
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:28,492
Except you forget
I may be wearing a false beard.

1198
01:17:31,545 --> 01:17:32,680
Very funny.

1199
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,530
No, Professor. I'll tell
you a better story.

1200
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,661
Maybe he is wearing a false beard.
- I hardly think so.

1201
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:40,856
Why don't you convince yourself?
Why don't you pull his beard?

1202
01:17:51,274 --> 01:17:53,524
I can't do it.
- No, you can't.

1203
01:17:53,778 --> 01:17:58,020
Too sensitive. You can murder a man,
kill in cold blood...

1204
01:17:58,134 --> 01:18:00,288
but you cannot pull a man's beard!

1205
01:18:02,856 --> 01:18:04,274
I can't believe it.

1206
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:10,483
Schultz! How dare you put me in
this position? I can't rely on anybody.

1207
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:13,810
You gave the order yourself...
- Shifting the responsibility on me again?

1208
01:18:13,843 --> 01:18:16,191
That's all, Schultz. Bye-bye, gentlemen.

1209
01:18:20,084 --> 01:18:23,948
Professor, I don't know how to apologize.
- You were only doing your duty.

1210
01:18:23,972 --> 01:18:26,975
If there's a slightest doubt in your mind,
why don't you pull my beard?

1211
01:18:27,168 --> 01:18:30,619
Please, Professor. No.
- Come on. Just once.

1212
01:18:30,648 --> 01:18:33,916
Don't rub it in. I assure you,
I never believed it for one minute...

1213
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:36,773
but this Schultz...
And, Professor, if you see the Fuhrer...

1214
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:38,018
You'd appreciate it if I didn't tell him.

1215
01:18:38,036 --> 01:18:39,930
I won't tell.
- Thank you so much.

1216
01:18:40,001 --> 01:18:43,863
Now, the important thing is to get you
to London as quickly as possible.

1217
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:47,484
With Mrs. Tura? - Of course.
Anything you say, Professor.

1218
01:18:47,574 --> 01:18:50,170
Get me the airport.
- Where's Colonel Ehrhardt's office?

1219
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:59,264
Heil Hitler. Colonel Ehrhardt?
- Yes, sir.

1220
01:18:59,357 --> 01:19:01,672
I'm in charge of the
Fuhrer's Safety Squad.

1221
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,305
I ride with the Fuhrer this morning,
and in one hour...

1222
01:19:04,338 --> 01:19:07,347
I uncover a plot against his life.
Can't I rely on anyone?

1223
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:08,873
But, General...
- Arrest this man.

1224
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:10,600
No, General.
- This man's an imposter.

1225
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:13,533
Are you crazy?
- He is Professor Siletsky!

1226
01:19:18,267 --> 01:19:20,926
Well? What do you have
to say for yourself now?

1227
01:19:21,243 --> 01:19:24,067
Here is a man with a beard,
and you didn't even pull it.

1228
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:26,555
I never saw a more gross neglected duty
in my life.

1229
01:19:26,665 --> 01:19:28,850
General...
- I've no confidence in you anymore.

1230
01:19:28,835 --> 01:19:30,382
I'm taking charge of
this case myself.

1231
01:19:30,495 --> 01:19:34,292
There will be a reorganization here,
and your head will not be spared.

1232
01:19:34,324 --> 01:19:35,623
And furthermore...!

1233
01:19:35,654 --> 01:19:38,581
General, may I remind you of your
appointment with the Fuhrer?

1234
01:19:38,865 --> 01:19:41,428
Yes. You'll hear from me.

1235
01:19:41,435 --> 01:19:42,765
Take him out!

1236
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:47,595
Piece of cheese?

1237
01:19:53,882 --> 01:19:55,482
Schultz!

1238
01:19:58,441 --> 01:20:00,074
I had a plane arranged and everything.

1239
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:02,559
But Mr. Rawitch had a
burning desire to act again.

1240
01:20:02,647 --> 01:20:04,519
When Mr. Rawitch acts,
someone has to suffer.

1241
01:20:04,852 --> 01:20:07,953
Please, Mr. Tura. Forgive me
for trying to save your life.

1242
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,850
Who really bust the whole thing up?
If you hadn't been so stupid...

1243
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:12,379
and jealous of your wife.
- I hope it's true.

1244
01:20:12,368 --> 01:20:13,819
But it isn't.
- We'll talk about that later.

1245
01:20:21,201 --> 01:20:22,748
Friends...
- Romans and countrymen.

1246
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:25,034
We know you want to play Mark Antony,
but that doesn't help us.

1247
01:20:27,036 --> 01:20:28,843
In 24 hours, they'll know everything.

1248
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,375
Then we're caught like rats in a trap.

1249
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:35,517
Just a moment. Hitler, of course,
will be sitting in the royal box tonight.

1250
01:20:36,324 --> 01:20:39,046
You remember two years ago,
we played Murder in The Opera House?

1251
01:20:39,174 --> 01:20:41,633
It was a flop.
- It might be again.

1252
01:20:42,107 --> 01:20:43,943
But we have to take the chance
to get out of here.

1253
01:20:44,575 --> 01:20:46,118
The situation is very similar.

1254
01:20:46,298 --> 01:20:48,886
There'll be soldiers in the
corridor guarding Hitler's box.

1255
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:51,916
If we can get them away
for just one second...

1256
01:20:52,457 --> 01:20:55,515
That means we need a confusion,
a commotion among the Gestapo.

1257
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:58,149
I have started a commotion
on every Gestapo man I've met.

1258
01:20:58,156 --> 01:20:59,836
No, we can't use you.
There'll be no ladies.

1259
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:01,870
But... - Greenberg?

1260
01:21:04,784 --> 01:21:06,298
Yes, Mr. Dobosh?

1261
01:21:06,702 --> 01:21:10,251
If we can manage that Greenberg
suddenly pops up among the Nazis...

1262
01:21:10,216 --> 01:21:12,801
It'll get a terrific laugh.
- No, it won't.

1263
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:16,231
Greenberg, you always wanted to play
an important part.

1264
01:21:16,465 --> 01:21:20,621
What do I have to do, Mr. Dobosh?
- lf you don't play it right, we're all lost.

1265
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:24,490
And if you do play it right,
I still can't guarantee anything.

1266
01:21:25,022 --> 01:21:28,224
What do I have to do?
- All right, let's rehearse.

1267
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,783
How does it look?
- Excellent.

1268
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:38,597
Sobinski, it's time to go.

1269
01:21:40,852 --> 01:21:41,753
I'm ready.

1270
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:44,235
Let's see.

1271
01:21:48,562 --> 01:21:50,932
Looks all right.
- Yes. He looks very good.

1272
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:55,733
I'll pick you up about 9:00.
- Oh, darling. Goodbye.

1273
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,627
If anything should go wrong,
if you shouldn't come back...

1274
01:22:00,611 --> 01:22:03,528
Then Sobinski won't come back either.
- Goodbye, darling.

1275
01:22:08,419 --> 01:22:10,767
I guess you want to say goodbye.
Go ahead.

1276
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,883
This may be the last time
we'll see each other.

1277
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,636
I can only say it was wonderful
knowing you, Maria.

1278
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,252
Goodbye, Mrs. Tura.
- Goodbye, Mr. Sobinski.

1279
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,139
Heil the Fuhrer.
- Heil.

1280
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:04,748
How did you get here?
- I was born here.

1281
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:08,214
What made you decide to die here?
- Him.

1282
01:25:09,429 --> 01:25:12,784
What do you want from the Fuhrer?
- What does he want from us?

1283
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:16,607
What does he want from Poland?
Why all this? Why? Why?

1284
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:20,081
"Aren't we human? Have we not eyes?
Have we not hands...

1285
01:25:20,084 --> 01:25:23,438
"organs, senses, dimensions,
affections, passions?

1286
01:25:23,615 --> 01:25:26,591
"fed with the same food,
hurt with the same weapons...

1287
01:25:26,702 --> 01:25:30,407
"subject to the same diseases,
healed by the same means...

1288
01:25:30,393 --> 01:25:33,190
"cooled and warmed
by the same winter and summer."

1289
01:25:34,471 --> 01:25:37,002
"If you prick us,
do we not bleed?

1290
01:25:37,302 --> 01:25:39,737
"if you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

1291
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:43,200
"if you poison us,
do we not die?

1292
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:46,620
"if you wrong us, shall
we not revenge?"

1293
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,116
Lieutenants Lange and Schneider.
- Yes, sir.

1294
01:25:50,302 --> 01:25:52,769
Take charge of him and bring him to my
headquarters. I want to question him.

1295
01:25:58,256 --> 01:26:01,643
Men, I don't want a word to leak out
about this incredible incident.

1296
01:26:01,798 --> 01:26:03,984
Who's in charge here?
- I am, sir.

1297
01:26:04,094 --> 01:26:05,575
How could this have happened?

1298
01:26:05,753 --> 01:26:07,740
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know. That's just it.

1299
01:26:07,892 --> 01:26:09,473
That's how you safeguard our Fuhrer.

1300
01:26:10,475 --> 01:26:13,830
My Fuhrer, it is my duty
to advise you to leave immediately.

1301
01:26:39,686 --> 01:26:43,483
To the airport. We have to make a stop
on the way. I'll tell you where.

1302
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:52,408
Greenberg, he always wanted
to play Shylock.

1303
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:54,604
And he got his chance at last.

1304
01:26:55,108 --> 01:26:56,915
And he'll play it again.

1305
01:26:57,335 --> 01:27:00,081
Not in the corridor, but on the stage
of the Polski theater.

1306
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:09,903
The railroad station.
- The underground is still alive.

1307
01:27:14,088 --> 01:27:18,275
Yes. We saved the underground.
Bronski, now we belong to history.

1308
01:27:18,464 --> 01:27:21,288
They might even erect a monument to us.
- They will.

1309
01:27:21,722 --> 01:27:24,384
I can see myself sitting on a horse
for the next century.

1310
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:25,992
Yes, and sometimes when...

1311
01:27:31,676 --> 01:27:33,449
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1312
01:27:33,723 --> 01:27:37,522
I am such a nervous wreck,
I'm imagining things.

1313
01:27:37,616 --> 01:27:40,938
Imagining what? - For a moment
I thought you were wearing a mustache.

1314
01:27:40,908 --> 01:27:43,440
I am.
- No, you're not.

1315
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,044
Are you crazy?

1316
01:27:46,922 --> 01:27:49,931
Where's my mustache?
This is a catastrophe. We've got to find it.

1317
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:52,009
I can't get out without it.
I've got to get Maria.

1318
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:53,730
What did you do with it?
- My mustache!

1319
01:27:53,857 --> 01:27:55,338
We got to find it.

1320
01:28:02,305 --> 01:28:03,765
Good evening, Mrs. Tura.

1321
01:28:06,338 --> 01:28:08,153
I suppose you're surprised to see us?

1322
01:28:08,309 --> 01:28:11,414
I'm delighted, gentlemen,
but unfortunately I have an appointment.

1323
01:28:11,463 --> 01:28:13,335
We have several things
we want to find out.

1324
01:28:13,378 --> 01:28:15,303
Couldn't I see you tomorrow
at your office?

1325
01:28:15,397 --> 01:28:20,060
No, I'm sorry. It is very urgent.
The Colonel and I were talking things over.

1326
01:28:20,355 --> 01:28:23,589
Mrs. Tura, we consider you a women
of enormous appeal.

1327
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:26,233
Thank you. But what's so very urgent
about that?

1328
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,601
It struck me as rather peculiar
why anybody like you could be...

1329
01:28:29,654 --> 01:28:32,029
- attracted to Professor Siletsky.

1330
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,404
You never can tell
about those things.

1331
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,777
For instance, you're
attractive yourself.

1332
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,034
Perhaps my taste is a little peculiar.

1333
01:28:39,116 --> 01:28:41,638
But I haven't Professor Siletsky's
distinguished beard.

1334
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:44,531
That's what fascinated you so much.
- Yes, it did intrigue me.

1335
01:28:44,534 --> 01:28:47,854
Brought out the child in me.
I always felt like pulling it, but I didn't.

1336
01:28:47,908 --> 01:28:50,649
What do you mean by that?
- It was a false beard, you know that.

1337
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:53,204
He fooled me and he certainly
fooled you, Colonel.

1338
01:28:53,586 --> 01:28:54,655
How do you know all this?

1339
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,859
Gen. Von Seidelman.
- What do you know about him?

1340
01:28:57,849 --> 01:29:01,138
He asked me to his office,
and I had to answer a million questions.

1341
01:29:01,131 --> 01:29:02,865
He thanked me for
the information and...

1342
01:29:03,287 --> 01:29:05,245
Gentlemen, do you by any chance
suspect me?

1343
01:29:05,421 --> 01:29:07,962
Mrs. Tura...
- General thought everything was all right.

1344
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:10,951
If Gen. Von Seidelman
thinks it's all right, then it is all right.

1345
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:15,300
What are you trying to get me into now?
- Colonel, it was your own idea.

1346
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:17,424
Shifting the responsibility on me again.

1347
01:29:17,448 --> 01:29:19,041
Good night, Schultz.
- Good night, Colonel.

1348
01:29:22,507 --> 01:29:25,094
This Schultz! Oh, Mrs. Tura, I'm so sorry.

1349
01:29:25,074 --> 01:29:26,961
I don't like to be impolite,
but I have an appointment.

1350
01:29:26,977 --> 01:29:28,112
Alright. I'll drive you there.

1351
01:29:28,099 --> 01:29:29,807
You don't understand. Someone is coming.

1352
01:29:30,521 --> 01:29:32,398
Someone is coming here?
- lf he should find you...

1353
01:29:32,878 --> 01:29:35,887
I am here on official business.
There is nothing to worry about.

1354
01:29:35,914 --> 01:29:38,737
Mrs. Tura, consider yourself
in the arms of the Gestapo.

1355
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,776
Colonel, I'm a married woman.
- But you're expecting someone.

1356
01:29:41,847 --> 01:29:44,314
- Now I have to stay here.
- But, Colonel...

1357
01:29:44,302 --> 01:29:46,834
I have to protect your husband.

1358
01:29:52,296 --> 01:29:55,943
No, Colonel, you mustn't do this.
- Mrs. Tura, I'll give you a bracelet.

1359
01:29:55,926 --> 01:29:58,940
I confiscated a beautiful one today.
- I don't want a bracelet.

1360
01:29:58,949 --> 01:30:01,005
I can make life worth living for you.

1361
01:30:01,035 --> 01:30:04,323
I can give you extra butter rations.
I'll give you three eggs a week.

1362
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,424
I don't want any eggs.
Colonel, please go.

1363
01:30:13,514 --> 01:30:14,455
Maria?

1364
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:29,014
Why didn't you tell me?
- How could I? Don't you understand?

1365
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:30,516
Haven't you any tact?

1366
01:30:30,805 --> 01:30:33,206
My Fuhrer!

1367
01:30:46,857 --> 01:30:48,404
Schultz!

1368
01:30:59,732 --> 01:31:03,314
Gentlemen, the Fuhrer wants to talk
to both of you himself.

1369
01:31:03,402 --> 01:31:05,869
The Lieutenant will take the control.

1370
01:31:11,021 --> 01:31:12,914
Yes, mein Fuhrer.
- Jump.

1371
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,627
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

1372
01:31:17,423 --> 01:31:19,230
Two very obliging fellows.

1373
01:31:19,837 --> 01:31:20,797
Now let's go to England.

1374
01:31:48,308 --> 01:31:50,493
First it was Hess, now it's him.

1375
01:31:52,906 --> 01:31:55,600
Everybody, a nice smile. Thank you.

1376
01:31:56,906 --> 01:32:00,487
And you, Mr. Tura. You played
the real hero in this amazing play.

1377
01:32:01,865 --> 01:32:05,987
I did my best and I was very ably
assisted by my colleagues.

1378
01:32:06,695 --> 01:32:09,824
Thank you, my friends,
for everything you did.

1379
01:32:10,082 --> 01:32:12,300
As little as it may have been.

1380
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,989
I am sure England
will want to show its gratitude.

1381
01:32:16,205 --> 01:32:18,158
What do you desire most, Mr. Tura?

1382
01:32:18,567 --> 01:32:21,165
Well, l...
- He wants to play Hamlet.

1383
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,286
After all, we are in the country
of William Shakespeare...

1384
01:32:24,276 --> 01:32:25,921
He wants to play Hamlet.

1385
01:32:27,638 --> 01:32:30,712
"Than is my deed
to my most painted word.

1386
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:34,036
"O heavy burden!"

1387
01:32:34,844 --> 01:32:37,981
"I hear him coming.
Let's withdraw, my Lord."

1388
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:19,321
"To be or not to be."

1389
01:33:21,068 --> 01:33:22,387
"That is..."
