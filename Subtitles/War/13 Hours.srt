Hey, I brought
these 17 guys, okay?

1216
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:35,123
But I do think these

1217
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,965
assholes, they were
trying to steal our cars.

1218
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:39,661
They were the dudes who were
supposed to take point.

1219
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,262
Yeah.

1220
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,598

We need to come in.

You know that thing
where the initial assault

1256
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,515
is just a ploy to draw people
in for the real attack?

Hey. Hey.
They're coming back!

adding reinforcements.

No Ambo.

They're still here.

01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,539
I think we got
hostiles everywhere.

The fire has just
got to be cover.

1285

They have control of the compound.
Why else leave so fast?

body through the streets.

Maybe he's 17 Feb.

Maybe he's friendly.
Maybe he's saying

1351
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:58,967
go the other way.
Go the other way.

I want you on Building D.

1536
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,732
Building A, Tanto, Boon.
Building B, DS guys, that's your territory.

1537
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:26,166
Oz, Tower 1. Zombieland.

1538
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:28,435
Let's go. Hit it.

1539
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:31,672
Move!

1540
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:33,554
KRIS: Let's go!
Let's go! Let's hustle up!

1541
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:46,186
OZ: Rone, I got the tower!
Getting up on C!

1542
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:12,039
They're just
the local shepherds.

1543
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,323
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

1544
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:10,571
Hey, what's going on?

1545
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:13,173
We got a neighbor at the gate
complaining about our lights.

1546
01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:15,175
What, does he think we're
having a pool party?

1547
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:16,610
He says the lights are bad.
They're going to find you.

1548
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:18,712
"They"?

1549
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:21,234
How the fuck does he know who
"they" are? Ask him.

1550
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:25,552
He's already gone.

1551
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:29,289
KRIS: <i>Guys, we really need to do
something about these lights.</i>

1552
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,557
We've got to shut
all these lights down.

1553
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:34,394
TYRONE: <i>Hey, guys, keep your
IRs pointed up for the gunship</i>

1554
01:25:35,431 --> 01:25:37,698
<i>that's hopefully
fucking coming.</i>

1555
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,367
Time for stealth
has passed.

1556
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:42,289
Viper, keep the perimeter
floodlights on.

1557
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:43,904
Shut off the interiors.

1558
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:47,307
Roger that. Roger that.
Come on, come on.

1559
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:50,744
In Iraq, we had Black Hawks to
get us out of shit like this.

1560
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,680
Yeah. Well,
here we got nothing and no one.

1561
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:55,782
Kill the interior lights!

1562
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:58,224
<i>We're lit fucking targets up here.</i>
I'm trying, man.

1563
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:01,689
Hello.

1564
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:05,659
Surreal.

1565
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:06,860
Different world.

1566
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:15,737
Who's this?

1567
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,174
Amahl, are those cars coming
from the neighbor's house?

1568
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:24,711
Hey! Where the fuck
are they going?

1569
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:31,852
Guys, we just lost
all our Libyan security.

1570
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,720
Does it seem

1571
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,355
like everybody knows what's
going on around here but us?

1572
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,890
That's for sure.

1573
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:39,660
Strobe's on, marking our position
for the Predator.

1574
01:26:39,662 --> 01:26:41,295
I hate to
break it to you,

1575
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:43,730
but I don't think we're
getting any gunships.

1576
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:47,334
Oh. Hell no. Air support?
That'd be too easy.

1577
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:50,804
TIG: <i>Viper, turn off
these goddamn interiors</i>

1578
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:51,872
or I'm gonna shoot
them out myself!

1579
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:53,574
I'm working on it.

<i>Work with me.</i>

01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,276
Fuck.
<i>Come on.</i>

01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,205
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)

1583
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:01,321
Sorry, guys.
I'm just a bit nervous.

1584
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,417
Wow. Thank you.

1585
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:06,987
BOON: Rone, which way
you think they're coming?

1586
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:09,523
When they come, they're
coming through Zombieland.

1587
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:19,700
That's strange.
That cop slowed down, then sped back up.

1588
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:21,942
KRIS: <i>I feel like I'm in
a fucking horror movie.</i>

1589
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:26,940
Chef?
Yeah?

1590
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:28,942
Put that down
right there.

1591
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,777
You go downstairs, make sure
everybody in this building's safe.

1592
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:31,779
CHEF: Got it.

1593
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:36,383
TYRONE: Oz? This is where
we make our stand!

1594
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:40,787
It's dark out there.
BOON: Hey, Rone,

1595
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:43,690
we're going to Building B.
It's better vantage.

1596
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:44,858
Get those DS guys
off of there.

1597
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,394
State!

1598
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,876
I want you to go down and protect
Building C from the ground.

1599
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:06,980
OZ: Guys, let's set sectors of
fire with overlapping coverage.

1600
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:09,283
Tig, I can use you
over here on Tower 3.

1601
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:10,918
Oz, what do you got?

1602
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:16,657
OZ: I got a couple
of local shepherds walking.

1603
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:19,726
KRIS: Hey, State, we got this.
Lot of acreage out there.

1604
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,428
Get on your NODs.
Copy that.

1605
01:28:24,033 --> 01:28:27,334
Hey, Chief. Are we expecting any
friendlies to set up a perimeter?

1606
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:29,836
CHIEF: <i>Uh... Not that
I know of. Why?</i>

1607
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,772
KRIS: 'Cause we got cars
amassing, east side.

1608
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,473
In the parking lot
out by that house

1609
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,409
where the teenagers are that
throw the M-80s over the yard.

1610

<i>Then I guess it
could be poker night.</i>

1611
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,613
Just hold on.

1612
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:42,683
Hey. I got two
cop cars pulling in.

1613
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:45,819
KRIS: Chief, are we expecting
any of Benghazi's finest anytime soon?

1614
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:46,820
CHIEF: <i>Let me
check on it. Hold on.</i>

1615
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:47,822
Yeah. Take your time.

1616
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:50,424
Alan, check
the perimeter.

1617
01:28:50,426 --> 01:28:52,226
Call Benghazi police
and see if that's them.

1618
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:56,275
KRIS: <i>Chief, these cops? I bet
you they work for the bad guys.</i>

1619
01:28:57,366 --> 01:28:59,733
Does this look
like 17 Feb to you?

1620
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:01,835
Dude, how can
you fucking tell?

1621
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:04,237
They're all bad guys
until they're not.

1623
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,610
BOON: And there go
the cop cars.

1624
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:11,978
I got movement.
You see this, guys?

1625
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,547
Yeah, I see it.

TYRONE: <i>Boon,

1627
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,616
I got unknowns moving
to the parking lot.

1628
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:17,718
Fifteen Tangos.

1629
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,353
I gotta call you back.

1630
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:21,395

TYRONE: <i>Oz?</i>

1632

OZ: All right.
I got five more guys

1633
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,994
right behind them
little shepherds.

1634
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:31,064
One of them's got something slung.
I can't see what it is.

TYRONE: <i>Everyone's got
weapons in Benghazi.</i>

Until you see a weapon
in someone's hands,

1637
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:35,736
you do not fire.

1638
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:36,837
I don't want anybody
going to prison.

01:29:36,839 --> 01:29:38,004
Roger that.

Oh, yeah, they're coming in now.
Come on.

1643
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:01,094
Chief, if we're
expecting any friendlies,

1644
01:30:01,096 --> 01:30:02,796
I need to know
that information now.

1645

I have no confirmation.

What do I do?

2207
02:04:59,059 --> 02:05:00,625
