1
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,755
(Distant gunshot)

2
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,960
(Explosion)

3
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,377
(Speaks Turkish)

4
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,343
(Yells indistinctly)

5
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,259
ALL: Allahu Ekber!

6
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,752
Allahu Ekber!

7
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,001
ALL: Allahu Ekber!

8
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,086
(Barks command)

9
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,755
(Man screams)

10
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,794
(Issues command)

11
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,710
(All cheer)

12
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,757
I think we're close, mate.

13
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,843
I think we're very close.

14
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,505
(Horse whinnies)

15
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,505
(Grunts)

16
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,086
(Laughs)

17
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,548
(Laughs)

18
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,136
(Dog barks)

19
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,797
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,253
Told you there was
water there, didn't I?

21
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,503
Told you. (Laughs)

22
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,676
(Dog barks)

23
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,006
Lizzie?

24
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,798
Everything alright?

25
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,544
(Forced laugh)
Arthur's worn through

26
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,089
the toe of his boot again.

27
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,676
What does he do?

28
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:22,839
(Laughs)

29
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,339
The boys are all in bed.

30
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,836
They're waiting for you
to read to them.

31
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,881
- I'm bone-tired, Lizzie.
- Oh, come on.

32
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,753
You know this is their
favourite time of the day.

33
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,761
'Prince Hussain
called to the man

34
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,923
and asked him why the carpet
he wished to sell

35
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,669
was so expensive,

36
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,760
saying, "It must be made
of something

37
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,047
quite extraordinary."

38
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,252
The Merchant replied,

39
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,673
“My Prince,
your amazement will be

40
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,215
all the greater when I tell
you that it is enchanted.

41
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,542
Whoever sits on this carpet,
closes his eyes

42
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,750
and says the magic word
'Tangu'

43
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,674
may be transported through
the air in an instant.

44
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,677
Wherever his heart
desires to be."'

45
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,673
I hit water at 15 feet.

46
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,385
Bit brackish
but good pressure.

47
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,672
With water we'll be able to

48
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,260
put stock
in that valley block.

49
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,048
They didn't even
wipe the mud off it.

50
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,218
It's been four years, Liz.

51
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,756
You're so clever.

52
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,047
You can find water

53
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,341
but you can't even find
your own children.

54
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,881
Why can't you find them?

55
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,843
(Sobs)

56
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,005
You lost them!

57
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,672
(Soldiers shout)

58
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,301
Come on, Art!

59
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,260
You won't win any medals
up there, mate!

60
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,093
Yeah, it's two hours
back to Rainbow,

61
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,551
we've got to get a wriggle on!

62
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,135
- You got that?
- Yeah.

63
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,093
I reckon I got it by now, Dad.

64
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,630
Arthur...

65
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,550
Look after me brothers and
keep me bloody head down.

66
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,714
I know.

67
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,794
(All cheer)

68
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,506
- Love you, Dad
- See you, Dad!

69
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,252
(Dog barks)

70
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,089
Lizzie?

71
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,089
Lizzie!

72
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,006
(Dog continues barking)

73
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,214
Lizzie?!

74
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,672
Lizzie!

75
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:32,839
Lizzie!

76
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,046
(Shovel scrapes against dirt)

77
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,800
You understand,
in all conscience,

78
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,545
I could not bury your wife
in consecrated ground

79
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,261
if I thought she had taken
her own life.

80
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,424
Consecrated ground is
his promise to the faithful.

81
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,670
She fell in and drowned,
so your conscience is clear.

82
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,635
Three sons killed.

83
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,048
That was quite an ordeal
for Eliza.

84
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,386
As the book of Job teaches us,

85
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,128
God sets these trials
for a reason.

86
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,094
Many families in the district
have made similar sacrifices

87
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,256
for king and country.

88
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,420
You know, you have a gall
coming in here,

89
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,634
making demands.

90
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,549
You haven't stepped inside
this place for four years,

91
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,591
you haven't been
to confession,

92
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,301
you're all but lost to God.

93
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,714
Yes.

94
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,211
And you and God can feed me
to the pigs for all I care.

95
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,505
But you knew this woman.

96
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,172
She was here every Sunday.

97
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,136
I've dug the grave,
I made the coffin,

98
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,093
all I'm asking you to do
is say some words

99
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,334
and throw some dirt.

100
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,217
That cart of yours...

101
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,758
...would make a useful
benefaction for our community.

102
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,218
An offering to God.

103
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,670
Well, He might <i>as</i> well
take that too.

104
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,214
(Dog barks)

105
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,672
I'll find them, love.

106
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,299
I'll find them and I'll bring
them home to you.

107
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,673
(Shovel scrapes against dirt)

108
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,297
Nearly there.

109
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,214
Thank you.

110
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,923
Not now. Later.
Thank you.

111
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:25,256
Major Hasan Bey to see
Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes

112
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,254
- at the War Graves.
- We know who he is, mate.

113
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,005
Righto.

114
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,465
Four years ago
they'd have given me a VC

115
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,130
for shooting that bastard.

116
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,593
Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes,

117
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,052
may I present Major Hasan Bey.

118
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,510
Major Bey was commander of...

119
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,627
Just Major Hasan.

120
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,627
- Bey just means Mister.
- Yes. Indeed.

121
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,173
Mr. Bey gave you boys hell
at Lonesome Pine, Sir.

122
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,795
We all know who Major Hasan
is, Lieutenant. Thank you.

123
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,881
Merhaba.
Hosh geldieniz.

124
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,378
Hosh Bulduek.
Turkce biliormusunuz?

125
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,547
Ah...

126
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,797
English?

127
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,715
I see you have finally taken
the Peninsula.

128
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,880
Yes.

129
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,176
Lost the battle, won the war.

130
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,339
Well, Sergeant Tucker here

131
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,460
will show you to
your accommodations.

132
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,086
Perhaps once you've refreshed
we could meet in my tent?

133
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,926
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

134
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,424
While I'm here, I thought
I'd make myself useful.

135
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,544
If you have any horses
that need any work,

136
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,919
I might go for a little ride.

137
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,636
Preferably something
with a bit of pep.

138
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,336
Ah, Sergeant Tucker,
acquaint Lieutenant Greeves

139
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,335
with Widowmaker.

140
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,710
She could use a workout.

141
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,959
With pleasure, Sir.

142
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,552
Now, we've already
started work in this area,

143
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,795
in the Nek down to Hill 971.

144
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,170
I assume they briefed
you fully at the war office.

145
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,636
We would appreciate your help
locating our dead.

146
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,343
Your dead?

147
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,426
Lost over 10,000 ANZACS
here on Gallipoli

148
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,544
and still don't know
where half of them are.

149
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,135
Some were buried properly

150
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,469
but a lot of the graves
have been lost, overgrown

151
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,756
or washed away,
or their crosses were pilfered

152
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,627
for firewood
after we evacuated.

153
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,797
Retreated.

154
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,464
You were here?

155
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,130
First Light Horse.

156
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,627
What do you need of me?

157
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,752
Well, the land has changed,

158
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,752
but you know the area
better than anyone.

159
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,172
I was hoping you could help us

160
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,511
locate the companies
we lost track of.

161
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,547
We can start in the morning.

162
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,130
(sighs)

163
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,128
We lost 70,000 men.

164
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,843
Here.

165
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,460
At Çanakkale.

166
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,837
For me, this place
is one big grave.

167
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:43,091
I don't know what you chaps
were belly-aching about.

168
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,302
This is a veritable
Garden of Eden.

169
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:54,509
If your troops had taken
this hill on the first day,

170
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,218
we would have been finished.

171
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,709
How close did we get?

172
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,422
There.

173
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,209
There you go, Sir.
Your Garden of Eden.

174
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,796
Joshua?
Where are the boys?

175
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:02,545
Ed, Henry, let's go home.

176
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,714
Run!

177
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,797
Come on, Ed!

178
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:26,839
<i>Boys?</i>

179
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,672
Boys?!

180
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,590
Art! Ahhh!

181
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,630
Ed!

182
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,839
Get down!

183
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,880
(All moan)

184
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,048
It's alright, boys.
It's alright.

185
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,962
Good on you, Art, for not
leaving your brothers behind.

186
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,551
Hey, Ed, what's
the magic word?

187
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,214
The one that
makes the carpet fly?

188
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,880
- Tonga?
- Tangu, you wombat.

189
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,047
That's it - Tangu.

190
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,966
Come on, cuddle up.
Get tight, close your eyes.

191
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,175
Ed's peeping, Dad.

192
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,464
Ed, close your eyes.

193
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,677
It only works
if your eyes are closed.

194
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:31,136
Alright, boys, let's get
out of here. All together.

195
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,127
ALL: Tangu!

196
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,760
(indistinct shouting)

197
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,377
Bugger off, the pair of you.

198
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,968
Go away. No.

199
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,801
- No?
- No.

200
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:23,840
Anything you want
my mama can make.

201
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,255
Hot water, no Germans.

202
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,501
No. Clear off.

203
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,922
Beautiful hotel.

204
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:29,339
Best room.

205
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,835
I'm going to Gallipoli.

206
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,835
- How do I get to Gallipoli?
- Huh?

207
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,255
I want to go to Gallipoli.

208
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,797
(Speaks Turkish)

209
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:37,385
- Mister? Mister?
- Gallipoli.

210
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,719
(Speaks Turkish)

211
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,585
Come to our hotel.

212
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,836
Beautiful hotel.
Beautiful view.

213
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,302
Anything you want,
my anne can make.

214
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,966
Maybe you can help me.
I'm going to Gallipoli.

215
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,130
No, you're not.

216
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,923
No-one goes there
without a permit.

217
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:54,044
You'll have to go to
the British War Office

218
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,419
- in Sultanahmet.
- Where?

219
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,340
- Sultanahmet. We go!
- Old city.

220
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:01,338
And... I'd keep an eye
on your bag if I were you.

221
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,801

Hello.

I, uh... I need a room.

234
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,840
You're from England?

235
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,005
No.

236
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,468
No, I'm from Australia.

Um, I'm sorry,
Orhan has made a mistake.

238
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,801
We have no rooms.

239
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:24,171
Your son dragged me halfway
across this wretched city.

240
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,340
Ah, no, no, no, no.
The boy was right.

241
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,086
Our best room is now vacant,
Mister...?

242
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,334
Connor.
Joshua Connor.

243
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,798
You are most welcome,
Mr. Connor.

244
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,960
The room is up the stairs.

245
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,381
Breakfast is at eight.

246
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,298
Would you like for her
to bring the tea?

247
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,509
Uh, no.
No, thanks.

248
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,128
But your son did mention
there might be some hot water.

249
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,718
Ah, it is shameful to lie.

250
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,551
You are a spoilt mother's boy.

251
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,170
Oh, no, it's alright. I must
have just misunderstood.

252
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,506
Please, please.
It is his duty.

253
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,756
Thank you very much.

254
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,297
This your room.

255
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,545
You seem to know
where everything is.

256
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,136
How about tomorrow you take me
to the War Office?

257
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,252
- I'll pay you.
- Yes, you will.

258
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:24,214
(Knock on door)

259
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:32,211
Towels for you, Mr. Connor.

260
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,677
I am preparing you a hot bath
down the hall.

261
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,044
It will take some time.

262
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,464
My son is no liar.

263
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,631
He seems
a very resourceful boy.

264
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,503
He is.
Very resourceful.

265
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:43,877
You have children?

266
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,926
Yes.

267
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,589
Three sons.

268
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,961
(Prayers chanted in distance)

269
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,090
What are they selling?

270
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,712
They're not selling anything,
Mr. Connor.

271
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:01,959
It's a call to prayer.

272
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,511
Your guide book
is out of date.

273
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,172
I didn't come here
to sightsee.

274
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,169
You should see the
Blue Mosque, at least.

275
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,464
Even in my 'wretched city'

276
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,881
it is a beautiful place
to find God.

277
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,594
I didn't come here
for him either.

278
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:24,925
I'm on my way to Gallipoli.

279
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:28,464
You mean Çanakkale.

280
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,003
There is nothing there
but ghosts.

281
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,011
My son, he cannot help you
tomorrow.

282
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,172
He is needed here.

283
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,420
Have your bath and come back.

284
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,467
I regret to inform you

285
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,587
we do not issue civilians
travel permits to Dardanelles.

286
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,881
It remains a very sensitive
military zone.

287
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,674
In fact, our friends the
Greeks have made things

288
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:26,839
even more complicated

289
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,131
by invading
Turkey's western coast.

290
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,220
It'll be some time before
we bring order to this chaos.

291
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,710
Arthur, Henry and Edward
Connor.

292
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,006
All served
in the 7th AIF Battalion.

293
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,547
They all enlisted together.

294
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,005
And they died together.
All killed in the one day.

295
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:54,507
August 7th... 1915,
at Lone Pine.

296
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,967
Yes. We do have
the Imperial Graves Unit

297
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,801
on the Peninsula as we speak.

298
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:05,215
They have a formidable task
ahead of them.

299
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,380
You must understand,

300
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,468
these men on Gallipoli,
they are experts.

301
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:11,587
All I need from you is a
piece of paper and a stamp

302
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,756
saying that I can go there.

303
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,627
I simply couldn't, Mr. Connor,

304
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,423
even if that
were my inclination.

305
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,010
I can find them.

306
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,878
How could you possibly hope
to do that?

307
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,510
Do you know what the army
used to do

308
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,218
with the rank and file dead

309
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,677
after Waterloo, Crimea,
Khartoum?

310
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:33,420
They would dig
an enormous bloody pit

311
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:36,876
and rake the whole lot in
with a few handfuls of lime.

312
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,836
No names.
Horse, mules and the men.

313
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,585
All turned into fertilizer.

314
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:46,757
This is the first war
anyone has given a damn.

315
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:53,043
My boys should be buried
at home,

316
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,965
beside their mother.

317
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,506
Go home, Mr. Connor.

318
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,461
(Shouting and chanting)

319
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:53,714
Come.

320
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,917
You have buildings like this
where you come from?

321
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,301
...but he didn't give up.

322
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,045
He kept on fighting
for three days.

323
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,927
I told you my son had work
to do here, Mr. Connor.

324
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:52,919
- Oh, I...
- He's ten!

325
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,794
What would you expect him
to say?

326
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,545
Keep it.
It's our secret.

327
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,837
(Laughter, piano plays)

328
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,552
(Hens cluck)

329
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,548
(Speaks Turkish)

330
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,631
- Good morning.
- Mr. Connor.

331
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,297
Would you like some breakfast?

332
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,464
Please.

333
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,926
I-I'm sorry, I don't
understand.

334
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,380
What's he saying?

335
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,131
Uh... my father hopes
you enjoy your breakfast.

336
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,667
Would you happen to have a...
a boiled egg?

337
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,171
(Omer speaks Turkish chant)

338
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,302
(Orhan repeats Turkish chant)

339
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,252
(Hens cluck)

340
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,135
Thank you.

341
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:47,590
English?

342
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,551
Ah.

343
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,335
Um... your wife,
he's asking where she is.

344
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,551
She's dead.

345
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,297
And your sons?

346
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,382
AYSHE: Without papers,
you cannot go to Gallipoli.

347
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,173
Take the ferry
to the town of Chanak,

348
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,464
then find a fisherman.

349
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:25,666
If you pay him enough, he'll
sail you across the straits.

350
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,886
He'll have no need
for British permits.

351
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,219
Thank you.

352
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,048
(Speaks Turkish)

353
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,585
Mr. Joshua!

354
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,837
Please, you find my Baba
in Çanakkale.

355
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,007
Tell him he must come home.
Anne needs him.

356
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,256
- This is your father?
- Mm-hm.

357
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,800
- Who's the man in the hotel?
- My uncle.

358
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,755
I'll have a look.

359
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,964
You bring him home!

360
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,503
(Soft clattering)

361
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,966
HUGHES: So, what were you
doing before the war?

362
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,381
HASAN: This is
the Ottoman Empire.

363
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,673
There was no 'before the war'.

364
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,626
In another life,
I was an architect.

365
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,003
I was a civil engineer.

366
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,834
Sir?
Are we expecting company?

367
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,585
Whoever they are,
bring them to my tent.

368
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:48,212
Sergeant, grab a couple of
blokes and go with Lt Greeves.

369
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,427
Sir.

370
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,048
(Echoing screams)

371
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,590
(Gunshot, screaming)

372
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,961
(Hooves thud, horses neigh)

373
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,381
Mr. Connor, I'm at a loss.

374
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,717
You walk off your farm,

375
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:13,959
you turn up unannounced

376
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:16,006
in this place of horrors...
and for what?

377
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,799
Gallipoli is eight square
miles of collapsed trenches,

378
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,419
bomb craters, barbed wire,

379
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,419
and more unexploded
grenades and shells

380
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,260
than there are pebbles
on that beach.

381
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,718
It is not safe.

382
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,882
I know what date
my sons were killed.

383
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,092
At Lone Pine.

384
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,136
There's a map,
and the last entry

385
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,048
in his diary is August 7th.

386
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,636
Rest assured,
I aim to put a name

387
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,252
next to every man out there,

388
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,877
including your sons.

389
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,798
I'm sorry, but you can't stay.

390
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:49,252
Tucker, escort Mr. Connor
back to his boat.

391
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,585
Your sons.

392
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:10,258
DAWSON: Sir, dinner.
- Come in, Dawson.

393
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,878
Wrap your laughin' gear
around that, sir.

394
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,549
Yum-yum, pig's bum, eh?

395
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:18,170
DAWSON: Sir.
- Hm.

396
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,340
Something you might want
to see.

397
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,880
Damn.

398
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,085
Want me to arrest him, sir?

399
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,676
And then what?

400
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:41,008
Take some food down to him.
And a blanket.

401
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:59,217
(Distant conversations)

402
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,834
- Not swimming?
- No.

403
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,256
What are you doing
with your farmer?

404
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:30,094
There's a supply ship back
to Constantinople in two days.

405
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,132
Maybe we could help him
until then.

406
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,003
You know what the chances
of finding his boys are.

407
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,253
We have the day
they were killed.

408
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,547
I know the area.

409
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,136
Yeah, we both know it,
but why change everything

410
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,298
for one father
who can't say put?

411
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:48,217
Because he's the only father
who came looking.

412
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:57,260
Sergeant!

413
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:00,009
Change of plan.

414
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,460
CONNOR: Who's the Turk?

415
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,506
<i>Hasan the assassin.</i>

416
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,627
Saw us land, saw us off.

417
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,798
That dog wiped out
half my battalion.

418
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,876
He would've killed your boys.
We're all best friends now.

419
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,128
I get to serve him breakfast
every morning.

420
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,052
Don't worry, Mr. Connor.
Abdul's, not ours.

421
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,004
This was our front line here.

422
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:42,086
You were there. Machine gun
here, machine gun here.

423
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,300
And one more there.

424
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:49,634
We could see you.
So many blue eyes.

425
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,844
Mashallah.

426
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,928
HASAN: It is very lucky
in Turkey to have blue eyes.

427
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:57,511
Everywhere, except here.

428
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:00,629
(Grunting, explosions)

429
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,131
(Gunshots)

430
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,381
(Distant shouts)

431
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,470
OFFICER: Listen up, boys!
Listen up!

432
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,756
We got to move up
that left flank!

433
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:19,300
Keep your heads low,
push forward! Now!

434
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:21,920
Stick up the nose
of these jokers!

435
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:24,761
We're gonna take
the trench tonight!

436
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:27,003
(Whistle blows, men shout)

437
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:31,084
(Explosions, men scream)

438
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,836
(Gunshots)

439
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,961
(Projectile whooshes)

440
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:44,544
(Explosions and gunfire)

441
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,511
(Men scream, grenade blasts)

442
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,843
TUCKER:
They're throwing rocks, boys!

443
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,426
They're out of ammo!

444
00:45:58,542 --> 00:46:01,091
Let's get into the bastards!

445
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,551
SOLDIER: All as one!

446
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,341
Let's do it.
Let's do it, come on!

447
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:09,088
(Men scream)

448
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:10,926
(Explosions)

449
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:15,468
You came in from two sides -
here and here.

450
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,256
(Men scream)

451
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,549
HASAN: We built a roof
to protect us from shell fire.

452
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:25,591
Instead we made a trap
for ourselves.

453
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:29,087
(Shouting and grunting)

454
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:35,750
Inside it was bayonets,
knives, hands, teeth.

455
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,674
It was so dark and close,

456
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,045
we did not see
who it was we struck.

457
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,886
(Grunting and snarling)

458
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,048
(Distant shouting)

459
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,760
(Screaming)

460
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,594
(Grunting)

461
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,917
(Men shout)

462
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:08,669
HASAN: Three days.

463
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,044
We only stopped

464
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,966
because we could not climb
over the bodies.

465
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,302
(Grunting)

466
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,715
(Screams)

467
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,547
(Gunshot)

468
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,343
(Rifle cocks)

469
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,086
(Gunshots)

470
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:40,421
(Distant screaming and
shouting)

471
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,048
As long as Allah
make me breathe,

472
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,465
let me see nothing
like these days again.

473
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,630
(Boom!)

474
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,669
(Boom!)

475
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,840
(Explosions continue)

476
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:11,136
(Gunfire)

477
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,795
(Gunfire)

478
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,548
(Boom!)

479
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,465
(Grunts)

480
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:33,209
HENRY: Are you alright, Artie?
ARTHUR: Bugger off, you two!

481
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,585
Leave me!

482
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:38,713
HENRY: Yeah, righto, mate!
Whatever you reckon!

483
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,177
(Arthur screams)

484
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:47,512
ARTHUR: Leave me!

485
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:48,797
(Arthur pants)

486
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:51,887
(Gunshots)
- No!

487
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,378
No!

488
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,923
(Rapid gunfire)
- (Arthur screams)

489
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:03,545
(Screaming)

490
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:06,546
(Arthur pants)
(Edward screams)

491
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:16,170
(Sobbing, screaming)

492
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:18,920
(Men groan and wail)

493
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,504
(Throaty wail)

494
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,544
(Sobs softly)

495
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,594
(Men wail and sob)

496
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:51,296
(Distant explosions)

497
00:49:55,708 --> 00:50:00,464
(Edward wails)

498
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:15,717
(Breathes deeply)

499
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:27,671
(Sobs softly)

500
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:36,047
(Wind gusts)

501
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:52,385
They're right here.

502
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,302
(Scraping and digging)

503
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,797
Sir.

504
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:43,215
It's your son. Edward.

505
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,844
No, I wouldn't.

506
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:13,544
The bastards executed him.

507
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:17,467
He gave the order
not to take prisoners.

508
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,757
He killed the sick,
he shot the wounded.

509
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,219
One shot through the head,
that's how they did it.

510
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,212
Especially him.
He killed your son.

511
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,301
He gave them no chance,
that's what he did.

512
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:30,135
HUGHES: Stop him!

513
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,048
I said stop him!

514
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,386
(Shouts angrily)

515
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,130
- Steady on, Sergeant.
- You killed my sons!

516
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,959
You sent them, Mr. Connor.
You invaded us.

517
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:45,053
Take him away.
Put him under guard.

518
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,093
I'm most terribly sorry.

519
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:57,135
He has two more sons.
We should keep looking.

520
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:05,052
War's over, Sergeant.

521
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:18,297
HUGHES: We found Henry.
- Lying beside him.

522
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:23,719
How on God's earth
did you know they'd be there?

523
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,881
But you haven't
found Arthur yet.

524
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,002
HUGHES: No, we combed
the area thoroughly.

525
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,174
Well, he wouldn't leave his
brothers, so he must be there.

526
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:34,421
We'll give Henry and Edward
a proper burial tomorrow.

527
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,920
I promised their mother
I would... find them and...

528
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,922
...and bring them home.

529
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,626
This is their home now.
It's not enemy ground anymore.

530
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,876
They're among friends,

531
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,752
probably the closest
they ever had.

532
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,798
Leave 'em,
they always will be.

533
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:54,964
Take 'em back,

534
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:57,632
they're just a couple of
dead blokes in the cemetery.

535
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,219
She wanted them buried
in consecrated ground.

536
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,052
How much blood do you need
for it to be holy?

537
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,590
You know we lost
over 2,000 men

538
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,301
in those four days
at Lone Pine?

539
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,843
The Turks lost 7,000.

540
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,302
We didn't take
too many prisoners either.

541
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,045
I don't know

He sailed through the night

he cried, "My son.

My son.

for my outburst.

There is a Persian saying -
may you outlive your children.

It sounds like a blessing,

560
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,385
but it is the worst curse

562
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:50,094
I had this list

This is your family name.

If this is your son,
he was taken prisoner.

00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:04,344
He did not die here.
He left Çanakkale. Alive.

No. I have finished helping.

Mr. Connor,
do you have your passport?

596
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:59,421
You were specifically ordered
not to go to Gallipoli.

597

I'm not in your army.

598

All I need to know is the name
of the prison camp

599
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:06,343
they sent my son to.

01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,460
If your son did not return
home,

601
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,792
the sad reality is,
he's deceased.

602
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,885
This was the Ottoman Empire,

603
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,423
one of the largest empires
the world has ever known,

604
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:20,215

where the prison camps were
incidentally,

609
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,802
the Turks and the Greeks
are turning the place

610
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:32,760

would you like us to start

You said the prison camps
were in Anatolia?

614
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,881
Who would have those records?
The Turk army?

615
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,924

They're all gone.

would he not simply come home?

Your army must have records?
Please, I'm at a dead end.

643
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:05,710
Then now
we are in the same place.

644
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,506
I told you,
I cannot help anymore.

645

Perhaps if you were to follow
20 paces behind,

659
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,294
then there would be no shame.

How do you find it
underground?

667
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,219
Well, there's the trick.
You have to feel it.

668
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,086
And you feel it every time?

669
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,711
No.
I have dug a lot of wells

670
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,756
that just turned out
to be holes.

Orhan asked me
to find your husband.

674
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,344
I hate this photograph.

675
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,382
Turgut is a musician,
never a soldier.

676
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,594
How long were you married?

677
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,672
I am married.

678
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,794
12 years.

679
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:04,295
My mother had arranged for me
to marry someone else.

680
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:06,715
But my father fought her.

681
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,799
He told her, 'Why would we
want our daughter

682
01:06:10,917 --> 01:06:12,510
to be as miserable as us?'

683
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:18,966
It is not easy
to marry for love here.

684
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:21,256
Maybe my mother was right.

685
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:22,547
Turgut was mad.

686
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:25,170
Bills to the roof not paid,
music all hours,

687
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:27,670

689
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,923
I wish my mother
had arranged my marriage.

690
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:39,589
You did not love your wife?

691
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:43,292
Oh, I adored her.

692
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,215
I was just so bad at courting,

693
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,212
I think she only married me
out of impatience.

694
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,677
(Chuckles) But it was happy.

695
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:54,422
Very. Until the boys were
lost.

696
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,339
It's good to know
where they are.

697
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,301
Not lost or nameless anymore.

698
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:06,712
I was told my oldest son
was taken prisoner.

699
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,756
So he's alive?

700
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,343
I don't know.

701
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,880
But you have hope.

702
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,630

Take care,
your fate is in there.

709
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,425
It is a silly peasant game.
You have to drink it first.

710
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:23,219
Now we wait.

711
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:30,629
We decide everything here
by coffee. Business, holidays.

712
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,755
- Even our husbands.
- And that works?

713
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,845
When two families
come together

714
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,130
to arrange a marriage,

715
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,877
the young girl
serves them coffee.

716
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,594
If it is sweet,
she approves of the match.

717
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,676
If it is bitter, go away.

718
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,882
The more sugar,
the deeper the love.

719
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:08,922
(Scoffs)
It is all peasant nonsense.

720
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,377
(Hens cluck)

721
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,593
- (Grunts)
- (Shouts)

722
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,176
(Cries)

723
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,339
Stay here.

724
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,005
(Cries)

725
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:01,884
Stop! Stop, you fool!
This is not your business!

726
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,881
This is what you want?
The enemy?

727
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,219
It has nothing to do with him!

728
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,667
My brother was a fool!
You disgrace our family!

729
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:21,299
Go! Go, you have to leave now!

730
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:23,840
You've offended his honour,
he'll not forgive this!

731
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:26,256
- He hit you!
- I hit him!

732
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,922
You see,
you understand nothing.

733
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:29,339
You will never understand!

734
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,381
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

735
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,128
Yes. Yes, you and your sons
and your armies,

736
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,627
all doing the right thing!

737
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,548
All you did was rob Orhan
of a father

738
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,419
and left me with choices
like this!

739
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,510
Then, please, let me help.

740
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,719
Ha, so now you will rescue us.

741
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,006
I didn't mean it like that,
I raised three boys.

742
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,217
And where are they now?!

743
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:52,967
This is not your world.
Go home, Mr. Connor!

744
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:17,631
You don't need to go. She gets
angry with me all the time.

745
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:52,087
(Grunting)

746
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:04,381
JEMAL: You would make a good
ambassador, Connor Bey.

747
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:10,921
You know him? This man
has dishonoured my family!

748
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:13,670
My orders are to take him
to Major Hasan.

749
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:14,839
Come here, Connor.

750
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:18,167
First we will teach him a
lesson about honour.

751
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,760
All four of you?

752
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,630
Come on.

753
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:43,671
JEMAL: I found your son's name
on a list of wounded.

754
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,875
They take him from Çanakkale
to a camp in Afyon.

755
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,503
After Afyon we don't know.
Winters are hard.

756
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,423
What, you mean he died there?

757
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:55,376
(Scoffs) No more records.
We are Ottoman, not German.

758
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,470
Tomorrow you will be on a
boat, back to Australia.

759
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:01,052
Jemal and I will travel east,
to Ankara.

760
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:04,296
Mustafa Kemal is gathering
a Nationalist army there.

761
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:06,090
We must pass through Afyon.

762
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:09,132
I will ask if anyone
remembers your son.

763
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,797
Could he still be in Afyon?

764
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:12,794
No.

765
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:16,171
As a soldier, as a father,

766
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:19,296
I tell you,
it is past praying.

767
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,215
ALL: Mustafa Kemal!

768
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:35,507
- Who's he toasting?
- Turkey's future.

769
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:39,209
(Jemal sings in Turkish)

770
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:59,467
(All join in singing)

771
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,672
HASAN: Look at him.

772
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:43,716
He is the worst sergeant
in the whole Ottoman Army.

773
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:46,382
Three times I have saved
this man's life.

774
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,969
- Never once in battle.
- (Chuckles)

775
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:50,585
Look at him, like a peacock

776
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,881
with big moustache
and gold buttons.

777
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,799
'I love my wife,
I love my children,

778
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:58,261
I have a big stick
up my arsehole.'

779
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,377
(Laughs)

780
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,550
Tonight, we kill this man
with lion's milk.

781
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:07,045
JEMAL: Serefe. Forget.
- Serefe.

782
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:09,295
- Serefe.
- (Speaks Turkish)

783
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:11,419
(Singing continues)

784
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,844
(Cheering)

785
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,960
(Chuckling)

786
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:24,756
First Australian I met-
not to shoot at, to talk to -

787
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,219
Was a thief - at Lone Pine.

788
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:30,007
This man waves a white cloth,

789
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:33,550
calls out and walks straight
across no-man's land.

790
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,135
He is carrying something.

791
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,177
1,000 guns are on him.
2,000 eyes. But he walks.

792
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:46,049
He reaches us and drops one
of our wounded into our hands.

793
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:51,167
We shared a cigarette
and he walked back.

794
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,128
- No-one shot him?
- I should have.

795
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,504
It's only when he got back
I realised

796
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,298
he had stolen my cigarettes.

797
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:01,760
And my lighter.

798
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:05,300
(Both chuckle)

799
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:13,090
AYSHE: Mr. Connor.

800
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,382
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
If I could pick up my bag.

801
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,923
Of course.
Orhan put it in your room.

802
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:25,045
I wish to apologise
for all I said.

803
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:28,296
I was angry.
I meant none of it.

804
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:30,795
I'm the one
who should be apologising.

805
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:33,841
You're right, I did fill their
heads with heroic nonsense.

806
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,710
God and king and country.

807
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:38,712
It was my job to steer my boys
to manhood.

808
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,506
And I failed them.

809
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:44,209
I measure a man by how
much he loves his children,

810
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:46,176
not by what the world
has done to them.

811
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,585
They'll be here for me
in the morning.

812
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,876
Well...

813
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,844
You can't travel
on an empty stomach.

814
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:13,171
♪ SOFT ROMANTIC PIANO

Mr. Connor! Good morning.
Come down here, please.

821
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:58,469
We've a very long walk
to the dock.

822
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:02,463
Lieutenant, if you'd be so
kind as to go down to the dock

823
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:07,293
and speak to the captain and
make sure he holds that boat.

824
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,135
Thank you.

825
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:13,175
CONNOR: I saw him, I saw
him clearly. He's not dead.

826
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,841
- You cannot go back.
- No.

827
01:22:15,958 --> 01:22:17,710

BRINDLEY: Connor!

828
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:20,210
Come on.

829
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,960
Kick that damn door in!

830
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,256
(Man grunts, door crashes)

831
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,627
Connor!

832
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:31,670
Go up over the roof.
You can get to the city wall.

833

836
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:41,922
BRINDLEY: Connor?

837
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,252
Upstairs!
Quickly!

838
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:52,211
Be careful of the tiles.

839
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:57,510
SOLDIER: On the roof!

840
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,799

He's alive, I know he is.

844

846
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:22,469
Ambassador, what part
of the Ottoman Empire

847
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:23,675
did Australia get?

848
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,715
It wasn't about land for us.

849
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,426
Always it's about land.

850
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:31,672
We don't need any more land.
We fought for a principle.

851
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:34,170
You fight, you die,
you get nothing.

852
01:24:34,292 --> 01:24:35,760
JEMAL: Good principle.

853
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:51,961
- A weapon, yes?
- In the right hands.

854
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:55,257
JEMAL: Yeah?
- It's a game, called cricket.

855
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:57,753
JEMAL: Cricket?
- Yeah, it's a cricket bat.

856
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,424
- You play?
- Yeah. Well, everybody plays.

857
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:02,419
Yeah, you need a ball
and that's the bat.

858
01:25:02,542 --> 01:25:03,589
Show us.

859
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:06,760
- You need a lot of space.
- Yeah.

860
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:15,177
CONNOR: So the idea
is you have the ball

861
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:17,010
and you bowl it
with a straight arm

862
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:18,502
and you try and
hit the wicket.

863
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:22,131
- Straight arm?
- Straight arm.

864
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,672
Ready?

865
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,468
(Laughter)

866
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,802
That's the way.
Straight arm.

867
01:25:31,917 --> 01:25:34,716
Englishers, always with rules.

868
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:40,549

870
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:46,131
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick.

871
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:02,334
The Greeks are deeper inland
than I thought.

872
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:05,052
They terrorise the people
and burn the towns.

873
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:10,094
We used to be one country,
now we are constantly at war.

874

if you don't know where it is.

894
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:35,466
(Jemal says prayers)

895
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,752
(Says prayer)

896
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,460
(Grunting)

897
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,927
(Gunshot, screaming)

898
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:53,840
(Bang!)

899
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:06,296
(Distant screaming and
shouting)

900
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,086
(Gunshots)

901
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,878
HASAN: Our horses need rest.

902
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,636
- Raki?
- Ouzo.

903
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:01,377
Same mother.

904
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:04,630
To Jemal.

905
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:10,960
It is a miracle Allah
turned a blind eye so long.

906
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,795
I will ride with you
as far as Afyon.

907
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,424
Joshua! Where are you going?
Afyon is this way.

908
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:25,209
He's here.

909
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,334
Arthur!

910
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:39,668
Arthur!

911
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:41,009
Joshua?
Come.

912
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,543
Arthur?

913
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:11,626
Art.

914
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,501
Dad.

915
01:33:28,958 --> 01:33:29,959
Son.

916
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:40,334
You're here?

917
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,501
Yes.

918
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:46,043
Yes.

919
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,460
Time to come home.

920
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:12,047
I'm not coming back.
None of us are.

921
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,668
They're dead.

922
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,675
I know.

923
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,543
How's Mum?

924
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,377
She's with your brothers.

925
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,551
You told me to take care
of them.

926
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:47,252
You said, 'Look after
your brothers'. I didn't.

927
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,968
Henry had his face shot off.

928
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:56,669
One minute he was there
and then he just... wasn't.

929
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:59,045
Ed bled out for hours.

930
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:02,171
(Moans)

931
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:10,342
(Moans)

932
01:35:38,042 --> 01:35:40,136
- Artie.
- Hey.

933
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,377
I want Mum.

934
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:50,459
Hold on.

935
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:54,344
Someone will come for us.

936
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:55,960
I'm a gut shot rabbit.

937
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:03,134
Artie.

938
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,927
Yes, mate.

939
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:10,426
I can't shoot myself.

940
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:13,801
They won't let me into heaven.

941
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:18,549
- You can't ask me.
- You have to do it.

942
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:19,668
No.

943
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:23,547
You're my brother.

944
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:23,385
Climb onto the carpet, mate.

945
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,335
Let's get out of here.

946
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,093
Take me home, Artie.

947
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:39,427
It only works
if you close your eyes.

948
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,172
I love you.

949
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:00,842
Tangu.

950
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:19,879
(Wails)

951
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:25,959
I killed them.

952
01:38:28,042 --> 01:38:29,885
They can't come home.

953
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,172
So...

954
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:35,294
You see?

955
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:40,177
It's alright to leave me here.

956
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,504
I didn't lift a finger
to stop any of you.

957
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:51,507
I killed your brothers
the day I waved you off.

958
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:56,961
Arthur...
your brothers live on in you.

959
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,797
You must go.

960
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:03,673
It's too dangerous here.

961
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:07,136
He's right, Joshua.
The Greek soldiers are here.

962
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,627
I must leave now.

963
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,752
(Shouting)

964
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:27,010
(Shouts in Greek)

965
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:28,752
How do I thank you?

966
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:30,252
Teshekullar.

967
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:34,844
Teshekullar, Hasan Bey.

968
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:37,962
(Shouting and gunfire
in the distance)

969
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:48,258
Tell your son
when he's well...

970
01:39:48,375 --> 01:39:50,594
Tell him he still owes me
a packet of cigarettes.

971
01:39:52,042 --> 01:39:53,635
And one lighter.

972
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:05,171
(Shouting in Greek)

973
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:06,669
(Screaming and shouting)

974
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:09,796
- Arthur!
- Dad! This way!

975
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,084
(Shellfire)

976
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:19,958
(Gunfire)

977
01:40:32,167 --> 01:40:34,135
(Speaks Greek)

978
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,878
(Shouts in Greek)

979
01:41:01,167 --> 01:41:02,510
Give us a hand.

980
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,218
This'll take you
across the valley.

981
01:41:09,333 --> 01:41:10,710
Once you pass the village,

982
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:12,881
head north towards the coast
and follow it.

983
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:16,044
I'm not leaving without you.

984
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:18,544
(Shell explodes in the
distance)

985
01:41:19,833 --> 01:41:22,256
I've buried your mother.
I've buried your brothers.

986
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,878
If you're not coming with me
I have nowhere to go.

987
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:32,802
Either we leave here together
or we'll die here... together.

988
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:36,631
(Shell explodes nearby)

989
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:47,676
Is it cold?

990
01:41:47,792 --> 01:41:49,920
No.
It's freezing.

991
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,673
When we finish here,

992
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:34,545
why don't we see if we can
find some fresh clothes?

993
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:39,713
Righto.
Sounds good.

994
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:46,254
'You want room, clean sheets,
hot water...'

995
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:49,049
No Germans.
'..no Germans.'

996
01:42:49,167 --> 01:42:50,168
(Gasps)

997
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:54,800
Joshua Bey!
You came back for me!

998
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:59,086
Welcome back, Mr. Connor.
Is this your son?

999
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:00,209
Arthur.

1000
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:05,167
Orhan... help me show Arthur
our second-best room.

1001
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:15,589
She's outside.

1002
01:43:57,667 --> 01:43:58,668
Mr. Connor.

1003
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:05,002
You speak Turkish
like a villager.

1004
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,627
Am I welcome here?

1005
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,252
All are welcome here.

1006
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:13,503
You don't seem surprised
that I'm back.

1007
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:16,549
It was in your coffee,
weeks ago before you left.

1008
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,136
I told you.
Everything is in the coffee.
