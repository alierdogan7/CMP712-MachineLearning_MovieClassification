1
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,911
It smells mame.

2
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,877
The first time she stood there.

3
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,559
I wanted to prove...

4
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,672
that "early American"...

5
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,997
deserved his little-loved son.

6
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,834
Mom, she is still alive.

7
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,717
That is our rich competitors.

8
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,913
And it is us.

9
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,994
Nothing to be convulsed with laughter.

10
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,395
- Times are tough.
- That's why...

11
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,913
we will imagine an ideal society...

12
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,475
a utopia for the 21st century.

13
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,591
An article on cosmetic surgery?

14
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,677
The naked woman can boost sales.

15
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,717
Let us focus on...

16
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,435
what the future holds good.

17
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,151
Biotechnology, space race.

18
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,199
- Positive thinking.
- From an old pessimist.

19
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,672
As you see.

20
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,871
People need to breathe.

21
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,229
I'm not that old.

22
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,194
Then the Middle East for Obama.

23
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,595
I leave that to the London office.

24
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,991
What else? Ah yes...

25
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,796
The daughter of deported...

26
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,956
against the state and the SNCF.

27
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,559
She won?

28
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,078
Yes. Chirac's speech at the Vel d'Hiv...

29
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,874
- Has borne fruit.
- On what?

30
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,913
Het Vel d'Hiv.

31
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,913
How do you spell that?

32
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,750
- You're <i>kidding.
-</i> What happened?

33
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,070
In July 1942...

34
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,271
16 and July 17, 1942...

35
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,311
13,000 Jews were arrested.

36
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,192
Especially women and children.

37
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,470
8000 have been parked in the Velodrome.

38
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,954
A horror.

39
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,310
The Superdome in New Orleans...

40
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,159
- A thousand times worse.
- At least.

41
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,229
Afterwards, they were sent
in the camps.

42
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,159
You're well informed.

43
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,431
Time Magazine...

44
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,234
I was entitled to half a sheet.

45
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,795
So now I want 10 pages.

46
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,472
Ten? I can not, Julia.

47
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,875
Our readers love the story.

48
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,196
Most are unaware of this history.

49
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,230
Young apologize.

50
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,518
So an old indoor velodrome?

51
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,358
Very beautiful. Where is it?

52
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,028
- Shaved 50 years ago.
- Photos?

53
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,673
Not precisely.

54
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,950
10,000 people crammed...

55
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,276
no bed, no toilets and little water.

56
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,675
- And not an image.
- There is one.

57
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,236
Buses in front of the entrance. That's it.

58
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,759
It's weird.

59
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,958
The Nazis filmed everything.

60
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,354
It is well known.

61
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,235
Mike...

62
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,669
There were the French.

63
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,752
A street like others.

64
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,712
No trace of the past.

65
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,672
There is a plaque, bld. Grenelle...

66
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,952
and a statue quai de Grenelle.

67
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,276
But the entrance to the Vel d'Hiv was good here?

68
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,437
My God, where will we?

69
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
At Pitchipoï, they say.

70
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,197
No, Beaune-la-Rolande.

71
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,279
Those attending will be released Pithiviers.

72
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,074
Believe what you want...

73
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,118
but ultimately to Germany or Poland.

74
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,915
Finally, wherever you go...

75
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,032
is the same, here we go again.

76
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,231
You see this ring?

77
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,239
It contains poison.

78
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,792
Nobody tells me when I die.

79
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,188
Person.

80
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,111
It is not dangerous to your age?

81
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,953
I will do an amniocentesis.

82
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,639
You can have a miscarriage.

83
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,831
Or be mowed down by a bus.

84
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,439
Why are you doing this?

85
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,634
You have suffered enough.

86
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,998
Because I feel it.

87
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,915
And if Bertrand supports me, that's okay.

88
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,838
Yes, if you support...

89
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,874
It does not tell him anything, dirty diapers...

90
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,116
and sleepless nights.

91
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,151
You're too old.

92
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,069
Thank you. It helps a lot.

93
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,999
Then this story apartment?

94
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,270
They have stolen?

95
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,993
No, like the Marais...

96
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,918
the Lower East Side.

97
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,078
Jewish immigrants were renting.

98
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,510
Bertrand thinks what?

99
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,269
I have not had the courage to tell him.

100
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,513
You are New Yorker and a fighter.

101
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,517
25 years in France will not change anything.

102
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,638
Do what you gotta do.

103
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,159
Easy to say.

104
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,875
Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski.

105
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,753
Executed at Auschwitz in 1942.

106
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,678
Not Sarah or Michael...

107
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,599
on any list of prisoners...

108
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,870
Poland or Drancy.

109
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,078
They had to flee.

110
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,673
You're a stubborn.

111
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,393
You would not do?

112
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,670
They can be anywhere.

113
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,233
They may be alive.

114
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,353
You want them to make room?

115
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,913
Why not?

116
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,109
Do not wake the sleeping cat.

117
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,152
My stepfather.

118
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,148
I'm sure they knew it.

119
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,157
They told you that?

120
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,276
I do not know how to ask them.

121
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,753
It's very simple:

122
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,471
Call them and ask them.

123
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,994
We will put the video online.

124
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,037
Nice speech,
that person will return.

125
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,516
His words made noise at the time.

126
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,995
Your article is amazing, Julia.

127
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,193
Say that it happened right in Paris.

128
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,116
It is to vomit.

129
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,357
What would you have done?

130
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,512
How?

131
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,039
How do you know...

132
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,992
what you have done?

133
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,430
I watched it on TV...

134
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,200
as civilian casualties in Iraq.

135
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,913
Please, Mike.

136
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,875
- What it makes?
- No idea.

137
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,474
Mom? Who's that?

138
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,432
I try to find it.
I'll tell you.

139
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,871
You'd think if it was serious?

140
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,114
Of course, my angel.

141
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,831
Do not worry.

142
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,715
You're there. I tried
to join you.

143
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,279
I cut my phone.

144
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,550
- I'm glad to see you.
- Me too.

145
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,354
Bertrand phoned.
He is worried.

146
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,788
What is it?

147
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,192
You did?

148
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,277
You have to talk to him.

149
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,156
We miss them too.

150
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,876
- I should come more often.
- Yes.

151
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,275
So you found?

152
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,877
An idiot would have found on the Internet.

153
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,230
There are five Rainsferd in Brooklyn.

154
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,556
To you find the right one.

155
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,795
What are you gonna find?

156
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,479
I do not know.

157
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,034
Someone.

158
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,828
I am looking for Sarah or Richard Rainsferd.

159
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,632
Not know.

160
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,119
Thank you.

161
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,914
I am looking for Richard and Sarah Rainsferd.

162
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,190
No Richard or Sarah here.

163
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,834
And in your family?

164
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,076
No, I'm sorry.

165
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,359
Sorry, you are
Richard Rainsferd?

166
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,388
Bob Rainsferd.

167
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,274
Do you know Sarah or Richard?

168
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,669
No, sorry.

169
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,268
Thank you.

170
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,788
Now, we'll...

171
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,228
You want?

172
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,159
I am looking for Ms. Rainsferd, but...

173
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,590
My mother is out.
You're a friend?

174
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,470
No, I know people
his family.

175
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,110
- In Europe?
- Yes, Europe.

176
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,912
You live in Manhattan?

177
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,634
In Paris. But I grew up here.

178
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,389
Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.

179
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,955
- Your mother said that?
- She speaks of Rome.

180
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,559
Excuse me.

181
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,076
We'll be there all day.

182
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,432
The nurse from my father.

183
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,597
It will not be long.

184
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,631
Is he ill? Sorry.

185
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,115
Mom is very strong.

186
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,914
She cheers up everyone.

187
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,356
It's her. I'll help.

188
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:10,152
That was in 1966.

189
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,756
Surely a tire that exploded.

190
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,999
The truck driver said
she swerved...

191
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,555
and he could not avoid it.

192
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,549
I met Richard two years later.

193
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,956
At first he did not remarry.

194
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,434
It was as if...

195
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,597
he wanted to be the husband of Sarah.

196
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,633
But years have passed...

197
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,274
and he eventually changed his mind.

198
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,279
And that's it.

199
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,832
Their son lives in Italy.

200
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,795
A son?

201
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,157
William, my half-brother.

202
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,157
He was nine years...

203
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,189
when Sarah had her accident.

204
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,557
Then, it was difficult.

205
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,519
But I like high
my own son.

206
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,393
I taught him to love Italy...

207
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,273
to eat pasta.

208
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,390
And he met a woman...

209
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,712
the village where I was born.

210
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,399
He never returned.

211
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,353
He lives in Florence now.

212
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,711
It did him good from here...

213
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,912
and rebuild his life in Europe.

214
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,073
It is the nurse. I go there.

215
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,674
Can I see your husband?

216
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,677
I do not know if it
a good idea...

217
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,589
to revisit all those things.

218
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,752
He is very ill.

219
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,435
I understand.

220
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,517
And his son?

221
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:33,199
Mom, answer me.
You have a lover?

222
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,233
Of course not.

223
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,953
But you'll leave Dad.

224
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,071
I never said that.
He told you that?

225
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,589
No, but why...

226
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,314
you're gone suddenly
Florence?

227
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,359
My darling...

228
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,154
It's much more complicated.

229
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,636
I go tomorrow...

230
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,398
and we'll talk.

231
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,751
And the baby...
You should have told me.

232
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,919
That concerns me too.

233
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,680
I know, I'm sorry.

234
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,957
- You do not want this baby?
- I say that.

235
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,959
I wish I had
a little brother.

236
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,833
Or sister.

237
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,637
But I will not change
its layers.

238
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,031
I love you, choupinette.

239
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,671
What do you drink?

240
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,836
Water, it will be perfect.

241
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,031
You want dinner?

242
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,396
Just drink something.

243
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,832
Water and a glass of Brunello.

244
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:21,518
You are a journalist. I investigated.

245
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,714
And write on
Tuscan cuisine.

246
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,317
My book is responsible for...

247
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,393
those extra pounds that I can not lose.

248
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,272
What can I do for you?

249
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,950
You're too young...

250
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,037
to have known my mother.

251
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,231
I am family Tézac.

252
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,959
- Who?
- The Tézac.

253
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,151
Sorry, I do not say anything.

254
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,277
They have taken...

255
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,630
Apartment rue de Saintonge...

256
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,717
after the family
Your mother...

257
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,153
My stepfather,
Edward Tézac was there...

258
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,516
when they found your uncle Michael.

259
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,830
I have no uncle.

260
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,518
The brother of your mother.

261
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,551
She had no brother.

262
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,910
Rue de Saintonge tells me nothing.

263
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,715
Maybe you
the wrong person.

264
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,717
Your mother's name Sarah?

265
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,434
Yes, Sarah Rainsferd.

266
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,517
And before that Sarah Dufaure.

267
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,518
And Starzynski, it means nothing to you?

268
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,632
Starzynski? No.

269
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,314
You made this trip for nothing.

270
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,233
Sorry.

271
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,398
There must be another Sarah.

272
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,275
What did you tell the son of...

273
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,152
You recognize?

274
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,838
It is impossible. Not...

275
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,951
There is a little resemblance, but...

276
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,152
This is not my mother.

277
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,752
Are you sure?

278
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,669
Yes, I'm sure.

279
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,310
My mother was not...

280
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,917
Jewish.

281
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,914
You want what?
You came to say...

282
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,997
that my mother had another name?

283
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,795
She was a victim
of this tragedy?

284
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,831
Sorry. I'm
Did you know.

285
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,516
It's madness.
My mother was French.

286
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,473
Sarah Dufaure.
She had no brother.

287
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,072
She never lived in Paris.

288
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,475
- You're wrong.
- Let me...

289
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,079
tell you everything.

290
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,555
No, I do not know.

291
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,478
This is important.

292
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,593
Let me be clear.

293
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,360
I do not want to talk about that.

294
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,435
And I do not want to see you again.

295
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,359
Please do not call me.

296
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,957
Enjoy your stay in Florence.

297
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,959
- Hello, Dad.
- William...

298
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,360
You should not be
with your family?

299
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,869
No, my place is here.

300
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,554
You saw this reporter, right?

301
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,789
One that tells the story silly.

302
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,670
Sit down, William.

303
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,832
- I'll help you.
- Sit down.

304
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:33,638
You mean all this is true?

305
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,513
Yes?

306
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,549
I remember...

307
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,277
the first time I saw your mother.

308
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,478
It was in a dance hall in Manhattan.

309
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,034
I noticed two things.

310
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,274
The first...

311
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,876
It was the most beautiful woman...

312
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,989
I had never seen.

313
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,398
The second...

314
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,317
Behind his smile...

315
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,636
she seemed to hide something.

316
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,791
We spent a good time.

317
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,036
But I guess...

318
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,238
she felt uncomfortable.

319
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,912
It was the saddest person...

320
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,354
I had never met.

321
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,394
I tried to erase this sadness.

322
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:27,512
But it was impossible.

323
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,471
It was not an accident.

324
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,478
His accident...

325
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,317
was not an accident.

326
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,274
You mean she killed herself?

327
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,674
- Papa!
- Listen...

328
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,755
She was increasingly depressed.

329
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,515
All drugs, alcohol...

330
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,553
As if she had a shadow in her...

331
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,194
who never stopped growing.

332
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,959
You want some?

333
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,836
- You do not say anything?
- No. Continues.

334
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,114
We had terrible fights...

335
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,352
about your identity.

336
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,672
What you had...

337
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,871
or ought not to know.

338
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,311
It was agreed on anything.

339
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,676
She had taken precautions.

340
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,996
Just after you were born...

341
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,839
she left the hospital...

342
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,951
for you to be baptized at the church.

343
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:03,676
I left work for the ceremony.

344
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:07,319
For her, if you were Jewish...

345
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,238
your life was in danger.

346
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,119
It's...

347
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,314
irrational, of course...

348
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,717
Everything is there.

349
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,871
What's this?

350
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,190
We never talked about...

351
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,870
but she wanted this.

352
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,155
Why do not you tell me?

353
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,070
Why you waited...

354
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,158
I have fifty?

355
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,197
I had no strength.

356
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,636
My whole life is a lie.

357
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,191
William, my boy...

358
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,517
You are what happened to me better.

359
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,913
We are all products of our history.

360
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:17,315
Yours is in these pages.

361
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,430
Go, my son. Do not be afraid.

362
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,350
What is it?

363
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,389
William?

364
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,199
Julia?

365
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,554
Sorry.

366
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,399
Even in France,
we shake hands.

367
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:14,309
- What's your name, princess?
- Lucy.

368
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,800
Nice to meet you, Lucy.

369
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:22,350
It's a tourist trap.

370
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,756
But I had often
here with my mother.

371
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,511
The sight fascinated her.

372
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,673
So...

373
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:34,475
You live here long?

374
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:37,197
About a year.

375
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,590
You are left?

376
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:48,594
Sorry, I did not want to be indiscreet.

377
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,233
- You've chosen?
- A hot chocolate.

378
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,753
The Dufaure have kept everything.

379
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,877
It's incredible.

380
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,991
They have been so happy...

381
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,679
meet you.

382
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,031
Was mutual.

383
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,958
I realized with these books...

384
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,435
I did not know my mother.

385
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,995
I knew his face...

386
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,509
her smile, her perfume.

387
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,270
But I knew nothing of her.

388
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:27,513
His doubts, his fears, his dreams.

389
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,191
And here I am: 40 years later...

390
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,391
trying to make his acquaintance.

391
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,271
Thank you for coming.

392
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,519
After Italy, I was very depressed.

393
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,628
It was a selfish...

394
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,876
pry into the lives of others...

395
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,752
to stir memories...

396
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,791
and even judge people.

397
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,358
By what right?

398
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,355
So: thank you.

399
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,674
No, I thank you.

400
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:07,519
Thanks to you, my father died in peace.

401
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,558
- And now?
- I do not know.

402
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,954
Weird, I needed to come back.

403
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,799
But I feel like a stranger.

404
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,557
France influenced me the most
I thought.

405
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,636
Perhaps I will return to Paris.

406
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,668
My eldest daughter does not like it here.

407
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,359
And I want the little...

408
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:38,074
way his father when he sees fit.

409
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,668
She is adorable

410
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,632
your little Lucy.

411
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:46,917
Lucy is the name of the giraffe.

412
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,311
Her name then how?

413
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,879
Sarah.

414
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,919
Excuse me.

415
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,269
It is I who am sorry.

416
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,833
Thank you.
