00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,333
THE FUHRER'S TABLE

2
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,625
MUNICH, NOVEMBER 8, 1939

3
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,292
We welcome our Fuhrer
with three cheers

4
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,375
- Sieg
- Heil!

5
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,625
I give the floor to the Fuhrer

6
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,542
Fellow party comrades!

7
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,667
Fellow Germans!

8
00:04:55,833 --> 00:05:02,708
I have come to you
for only a few hours,

9
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,167
to evoke in your midst

10
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:10,792
the memory of a day

11
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,333
FOG! AIRPLANE UNABLE TO START!

12
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,917
which was of great importance for us,

13
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,500
for our movement,
and for the German people

14
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:26,625
If, during the four years
from 1919 to 1923,

15
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,917
the National Socialist Movement
was able to grow to such an extent

16
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,625
that it succeeded, for the first time,

17
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:38,542
in mobilising the entire nation
in a stirring event,

18
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,833
then this was due to the general state
Germany found itself in.

19
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,542
KONSTANZ, LAKE CONSTANCE

20
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,417
A terrible catastrophe
had befallen our country and our people.

21
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,083
What forced Germany to succumb
at the time

22
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,625
were the lies of our adversaries.

23
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,375
GERMAN-SWISS BORDER

24
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,917
The lies told by the same men
who are lying again today.

25
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:01,500
However, everyone must understand
that they are not sacrificing any more

26
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,792
than all the others
sacrificed before them

27
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,542
We are also aware

28
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,792
of how much
destiny has assisted us

29
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,958
and enabled us to do so much.

30
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:19,125
It let us forge our plans in the right way

31
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,958
and blessed their successful outcome.

32
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,625
Hello!

33
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,458
Where are you going?

34
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,292
I'm looking for an old friend

35
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,667
Feuchtelhuber
of the Konstanz Folklore Society

36
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,417
I used to be a member there

37
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,417
None of us know
whether they will suffer

38
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,583
What our women sacrifice
to bear the nation's children,

39
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,500
our men sacrifice
by defending the country

40
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,333
We National Socialists
have always been fighters

41
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,917
Now the great moment has come
to prove ourselves as fighters

42
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:14,792
No one but us can be victorious.

43
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,542
That Mr. Churchill doesn't think so,

44
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,833
I shall put down to his old age.

45
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,792
Others didn't believe it either.

46
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,500
They will be told by Churchill,
by Chamberlain...

47
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,458
Why are you wearing that badge?

48
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,792
Out of support

49
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,792
The Red Front
is an illegal organisation

50
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:54,833
...if we hadn't been
drawn into it by England.

51
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,625
England boosted its power
through agitation and incitement.

52
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,292
REICH SECURITY MAIN OFFICE

53
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,958
Heinrich, I'd like to join
my wife at the opera

54
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,792
The Reichsfuhrer wants our new figures

55
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,417
submitted to him
for the big meeting tomorrow

56
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,708
What's complicated
about listing all detained lunatics?

57
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,042
The clerical task isn't complicated

58
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,375
But we need to decide
whether to include church institutions

59
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:22,000
No exceptions
This reflects the Reichsfuhrer's wishes

60
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,708
The priests will make a fuss

61
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,500
They'll calm down again

62
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,833
I'd propose to Himmler
that we proceed step by step

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,375
First

64
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:32,667
Not now, Bauer!

65
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,417
An attempt on the Fuhrer's life in Munich

66
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,583
A bomb

67
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,792
Half the roof is said to have caved in

68
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,417
First MG squad, take position!

69
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,375
Second MG squad, take position!

70
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,125
Alight!

71
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,042
Move!

72
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,333
- Move!
- Line formation!

73
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,958
Line up!

74
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,500
- Here's the list
- Thank you

75
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,500
Heil Hitler!

76
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:01,958
My name is Eberle,

77
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,417
I'm the Local Party Leader here
At your service

78
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,583
Heil Hitler

79
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,000
All relatives of one Georg Elser,

80
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,958
last known address Turkenstrase 59
in Munich, to report to the square

81
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,583
What has Georgie done?

82
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,417
You instruct my men

83
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,000
But the Elsers are harmless

84
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,292
That's an order!

85
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:21,833
Yes, sir!

86
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,667
Is this the lot of them?

87
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,542
Yes, Major,

88
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,833
including his former fiancee,
Elsa Stephan

89
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,417
The whole lot to Berlin for questioning!

90
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,792
Come!

91
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,167
How dare you?

92
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,458
- Let go!
- Don't, Elsa, or they'll take them, too

93
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,625
I'll bring them to your mother

94
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,542
These are the corrected lunatic asylum
statistics that we're re-submitting

95
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,875
- Including the church ones?
- Yes The gentlemen are waiting

96
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,542
Gentlemen, we cannot afford
to make a mistake now,

97
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,000
not even the slightest

98
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,000
Halt!

99
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,958
Heil Hitler, Mr Elser

100
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,333
Heil Hitler

101
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,500
Good day

102
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,708
Or good day, if you prefer that

103
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,292
My name is Nebe

104
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,250
Head of Criminal Police
I'm in charge of your case

105
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,542
This is the head of the Gestapo,
Oberfuhrer Muller

106
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,917
Elser

107
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,958
How do you think
your wicked assassination attempt ended?

108
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,833
We mourn the death of seven innocent
people for which you are responsible

109
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,417
Seven men and women,

110
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,583
including a waitress,
married with two children

111
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,583
A marching band flautist, leaving behind
a wife and teenage daughter

112
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,250
What did these people do to you?

113
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:17,375
Who gave you the right to kill them?

114
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,708
Don't you have anything to say
to the relatives?

115
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,708
Not a single word?

116
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,958
Do you think the Fuhrer is dead?

117
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,375
You think you succeeded?

118
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,083
The Fuhrer is alive

119
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,667
He left the Burgerbraukeller
13 minutes before the explosion

120
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,500
Your assassination attempt failed

121
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,875
You were carrying bomb schematics
when you were arrested

122
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,417
You spent a lot of time
at the Burgerbraukeller

123
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,083
Take off your trousers

124
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,000
I want to see your knees

125
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,750
Off with your trousers!

126
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,333
I want to see your knees

127
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
Elser

128
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm now giving you your only chance
to own up to everything

129
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,042
You think you know everything already
Shoot me and get it over with

130
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,375
We're not there yet by a long way

131
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,750
Let's start right at the beginning

132
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,333
Name? Date of birth?

133
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,875
KONSTANZ, LAKE CONSTANCE 1932

134
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,792
Where we gather

135
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,458
Under the linden trees

136
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,292
A t eventide

137
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,250
Where we gather

138
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,333
Under the linden trees

139
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,042
A t eventide

140
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:58,875
Many hours we've spent here together

141
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:02,125
Sitting in a...

142
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,292
You know you'll have to make up
for your attack

143
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,833
Do you love me?

144
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,125
You never commit, do you?

145
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,958
You know I like spending time with you

146
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,708
And what about Bruni?

147
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,708
Nothing She's having fun too

148
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,917
I'll leave if you want

149
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,000
Are you crazy?

150
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,917
I hope no one died

151
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,917
That stupid old drunkard

152
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,583
Your father? Is he dead?

153
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,708
He sold another two fields,
our best land

154
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,375
Now I'm supposed
to sort things out at home

155
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,583
The Messerschmitt is worth two

156
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,792
Georgie Elser is back

157
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,042
- Hi, Lore How's the leg?
- Same as always

158
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,750
Will you stay with your folks now?

159
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,458
Looks like it

160
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,083
They need you urgently

161
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:53,417
You have to register within 48 hours,
that's now the law

162
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,542
I won't stay longer than four weeks

163
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,625
- Still
- All you can think of is supervising

164
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,083
Hi, Elmar

165
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,500
My dad says
Lore shouldn't act like a big shot,

166
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,833
she's with a Jew from Heidenheim

167
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,750
Who turned you
into a moron all of a sudden?

168
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,542
There, you better
give me a hand with this

169
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,333
Good day

170
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,375
Are there soldiers
at the Konstanz border crossing?

171
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,583
Customs officers, that's enough

172
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,875
What's in the box? Show me

173
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,958
There's no show today

174
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,167
Mother?

175
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,042
Georg

176
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,833
At last

177
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,500
Come here, my boy

178
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,917
- Thank you for coming
- Where is he?

179
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,500
Come on, no stopping

180
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,083
Leave the cider alone

181
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,333
Damn it!

182
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,083
Keep the blade straight!

183
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:37,000
If I'm supposed to help you,
stop the boozing

184
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,000
You little shit!
That cider was expensive!

185
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,667
I never booze and I'm still alive

186
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:54,833
I don't like repeating myself

187
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,458
Name? Date of birth?

188
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,708
Name? Date of birth?

189
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,250
Name? Date of birth?

190
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,125
Name?

191
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,458
Date of birth?

192
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,542
Name? Date of birth?

193
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,833
Name? Date of birth?

194
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,083
Name? Date of birth?

195
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,625
Name? Date of birth?

196
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:07,167
Name? Date of birth?

197
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,958
Name? Date of birth?

198
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,917
Again:

199
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,917
Name? Date of birth?

200
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,958
Kiss my ass

201
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,958
I can't hear you

202
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,125
Kiss my ass!

203
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:50,667
Send this to Baumann I want him
to order this weed killer from IG Farben

204
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,167
Very well, Oberfuhrer

205
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,500
I know this breed from the Swabian Hills

206
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,042
They'd rather
be beaten to death than give in

207
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,417
Shall I tell this to the Reichsfuhrer SS?

208
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,958
There's this breed
from the Swabian Hills

209
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,042
That guy is merely a puppet

210
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,292
Just look at his physiognomy,

211
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,542
his eyes

212
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,417
He's not some naive idiot
The man knows what he wants

213
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:18,792
He may be a country boy, but he's
not lacking ideological conviction

214
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,875
And the evidence is overwhelming

215
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,958
The Fuhrer doesn't want evidence,
he wants a written confession

216
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,083
Goebbels needs it for the press

217
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,792
I'll pull out every one of his teeth
to make him sign if I have to

218
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,667
You saw that he won't budge

219
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,792
Are you telling me
how to do my job now?

220
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,583
Your lot should have
known about this sooner

221
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,542
Now where is that list
of the arrested relatives?

222
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:15,167
I'm asking myself how an ethnic German
can hate our Fuhrer so much

223
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,292
to carry out such a despicable attack

224
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,500
And on November 8th, of all days

225
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,917
Now look who's joining us, Elser

226
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,583
Come in!

227
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,792
Evening all

228
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,792
- Ernst, a beer and a kirsch!
- Beer and a kirsch, coming up

229
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,792
No Erich has had enough
Two orange sodas, please

230
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:34,083
What's it going to be, Erich?
Soda or the usual?

231
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,250
The usual, you dumbass!

232
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,708
Thank you

233
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,542
Shall we get some fresh air?

234
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,583
That's Elsa

235
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,458
She's married

236
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,500
Those are the best ones

237
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,583
This seat is taken, Eberle

238
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,708
We found another dead hare
in a sling today

239
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,625
In the woods, near the ltzeIsberg

240
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,542
- That's above my field
- Piss off, Eberle

241
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:58,542
I'll give you a good kicking
if the poaching doesn't stop

242
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,500
The dance is called a tango
It's from South America

243
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:10,458
It's very close, almost sinful

244
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,958
Watch

245
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,042
One

246
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:45,333
One, two, tango step

247
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,500
One, two

248
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,375
Something like that

249
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,417
I'm Georgie Elser

250
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,167
You're Elsa, aren't you?

251
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,750
I'm going back to my Erich

252
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,000
Hans, a round, time to celebrate!

253
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,042
So, what was the percentage?

254
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:14,333
The NSDAP is the biggest party
in the Reichstag with 44%

255
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,833
Come, Lore Let's go

256
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,875
The Reds lost
What do you say now?

257
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,458
There you go

258
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,708
- Come on, let's go
- No, I'll finish my drink

259
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:29,875
There you go

260
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
To our Fuhrer Sieg Heil!

261
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,125
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!

262
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,542
- Quiet, we're playing cards!
- Hang on

263
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,917
We'll have no shouting here

264
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,250
- Who's shouting here?
- Calm down

265
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,667
Stay calm

266
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,792
Calm down Let's stay calm

267
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,958
Schurr, you'll be the first
to be strung up once we seize power

268
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,417
And you'll be shot after the revolution

269
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,750
Idiots

270
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,667
You've been to Konstanz
and Switzerland?

271
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:15,208
- Yes
- Did you go to the cinema there?

272
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:27,542
I saw a picture of Jacqueline Wells
in a magazine

273
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:32,083
She's so beautiful
in "Tarzan the Fearless"

274
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:42,292
They say she's wearing
hardly anything in that film

275
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,458
That would interest you, of course

276
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,833
Just die, you bastards!
Sons of bitches!

277
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:16,667
Why did you leave?

278
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,625
You've been fighting
with the Nazis for years For what?

279
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,958
Musician! Go home and pray

280
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,292
Dirty pacifist!

281
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,292
- So what?
- Shut up!

282
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,375
You're a coward?

283
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,792
Yes, maybe I am a coward,

284
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,125
because violence
has never achieved anything

285
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:55,042
Elser, now tell your girl here
why you did this

286
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Did you do this, Georg?

287
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,875
Elsa

288
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:16,875
Take her away

289
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,708
Where are they taking her?

290
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,708
That's entirely up to you

291
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,458
Our Father who art in heaven,

292
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,708
hallowed be thy name

293
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,917
Thy kingdom come Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven

294
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,625
Give us this day our daily bread,

295
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:11,667
and forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us,

296
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,083
and lead us not into temptation,

297
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,458
but deliver us from evil

298
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,375
For thine is the kingdom,

299
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,792
and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever

300
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,375
Amen

301
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,042
- Elsa
- Yes?

302
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,833
She has nothing to do with this

303
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,167
Will you guarantee
she won't be harmed?

304
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,333
She's not important to us
if we have a confession from you

305
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,625
If not, it's a different matter

306
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,583
My word as an officer

307
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,667
That means nothing to me

308
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,833
I can't offer more

309
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:07,417
All right then It was me

310
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,667
My name is Elser, Johann Georg

311
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,292
Born 4th January, 1903

312
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,250
Let's begin

313
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,917
Party membership?

314
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,083
None

315
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,208
And this?

316
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,375
My Red Front badge

317
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:36,833
But I was never
a Communist Party member

318
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,167
- Red Front
- Red Front

319
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,500
Good that you're with us

320
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:08,750
WORKERS VOTE KPD

321
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,250
- Josef!
- What?

322
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,417
The H

323
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,708
- What?
- The H

324
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:19,750
- Shit!
- Add it!

325
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,417
- Or the Browns will say we're idiots
- Come on!

326
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,375
Watch out!

327
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,625
Shit!

328
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,542
Stop! Halt!
Site security!

329
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,667
"I joined the Konstanz
Folklore Society"

330
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,583
Just for the companionship?

331
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,667
I didn't join to pick up girls

332
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,542
You can meet girls anywhere

333
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,458
And before you ask, I wasn't close
to any girl from the society

334
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,500
Of course there was the occasional

335
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:36,250
Why don't you just admit
you're a communist?

336
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:39,750
No, I thought it was enough to vote KPD

337
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm sure you were involved
in demonstrations, handing out flyers

338
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,625
No I didn't even attend meetings

339
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,208
It's highly unlikely an apolitical person

340
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,667
would plan and carry out
an attack on such a huge scale

341
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,708
I was a free human being

342
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,458
Meaning?

343
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,417
You have to do what's right

344
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,042
If humanity isn't free,
everything dies with it

345
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,292
Am I allowed to write one last letter?

346
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:19,250
Please, just a few lines
to my fiancee and my mother

347
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,708
Take him away

348
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,000
MUNICH ASSASSIN CAPTURED

349
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:35,083
ASSASSIN CAPTURED

350
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:52,958
That small-time carpenter is trying to
hoodwink us, claiming he acted alone

351
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,417
Just one man can't construct
such a powerful bomb

352
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:59,583
Elser insists he carried out
the attack on his own

353
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,167
- There's no evidence
- We won't let criminals call us liars!

354
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:08,250
The Fuhrer wants us to get him to talk
by any means necessary

355
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:09,667
He must say who's behind it

356
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:16,583
Obergruppenfuhrer, it's becoming clear
no one else is pulling the strings here

357
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:23,083
You might trigger the Fuhrer's reaction
for being soft and failing when it counts

358
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,167
We don't believe a word of it

359
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,583
What?

360
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,958
"For 30 nights, I waited until I got
locked in to the Burgerbraukeller

361
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,167
"I wrapped a rag around
the rear part of the drill

362
00:45:56,333 --> 00:46:01,458
"I benefited from the lavatories
automatically flushing every 10 minutes

363
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,000
"I used the sound to conceal my work,

364
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:07,708
then waited another 10 minutes
for the flushing to start again "

365
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:08,875
Correct

366
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:12,000
A lowly craftsman like you
couldn't build a bomb like that

367
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:14,042
Who supplied your material?

368
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,750
For the last time,
who were you working for?

369
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,083
All right, I'll tell you

370
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:27,125
We only have two telephones
in the village

371
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:29,042
Churchill called me at the dairy

372
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,542
The mayor's office
would have been a bad idea

373
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,375
Churchill called and said,

374
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:37,708
"Elser, build a bomb to blow up Hitler
for me, we can't do it on our own "

375
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,417
I can't tell you what didn't happen

376
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,792
Just give me pen and paper
and I'll prove it to you!

377
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,583
18, 20

378
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,208
I'm out

379
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,750
- Three
- I'm out

380
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:25,083
I'll go for diamonds if you don't mind

381
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:28,917
- Heil Hitler, everyone
- Heil Hitler

382
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:30,500
Hi

383
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:34,000
Ah, I see, voluntary disbanding

384
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,167
Very sensible

385
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:39,542
But if you think that the strike fund
will disappear with you,

386
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,625
you've got another thing coming

387
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,917
Listen up, national comrades

388
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,833
How about attending
the Gauleiter's rally in Heidenheim later

389
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,083
instead of playing cards at the pub?

390
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:53,208
Heil Hitler and good day

391
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,958
- Heil Hitler
- Good day

392
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,750
Ernst, the usual combo

393
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,250
Coming up

394
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,250
Tell your Gauleiter
there was another hare caught in a sling

395
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:06,750
You can do whatever you like

396
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,292
But don't complain if it hurts

397
00:48:16,292 --> 00:48:17,792
That was Elsa

398
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:24,458
But let me tell you, Eberle,
she won't talk back any time soon

399
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:43,875
Elsa?

400
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:52,083
- Elsa?
- Leave me alone

401
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,958
- Why?
- I don't want you to see me like this

402
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,417
What about Erich?

403
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:40,833
He'll get drunk at the pub
The children are asleep

404
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:52,875
You

405
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:21,708
It's different with you

406
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:24,708
Do you know that?

407
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,833
When will you be going back
to Konstanz?

408
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,917
If the instrument maker pays
for the maple wood, we could make it

409
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,500
Yes, Georg, God willing

410
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:23,167
If not, the marshals
will come take our house away

411
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,625
Where do we go then?

412
00:51:24,792 --> 00:51:26,875
I don't know

413
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,375
I might move in with Elsa

414
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:31,667
You shouldn't fool around
with married women

415
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,458
There's no fooling around

416
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,125
Erich is asking for a lodger
because he's hard up

417
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:40,000
You're not fooling me
No one around here has any money

418
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,708
You want to be near that woman

419
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:44,667
She has a bastard child and you too

420
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:47,667
Don't get carried away, mother
I'm a bastard myself

421
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:49,958
But your father married me

422
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:53,292
Elsa made her daughter
legitimate too So what?

423
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:55,792
You left Mathilde with your child

424
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,500
Is that the done thing?

425
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,542
I don't care what the done thing is

426
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:02,250
If two people aren't right together,
it's misery

427
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:04,333
Just look at you and father

428
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,125
You'll see what this leads to,

429
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:11,833
always doing exactly the opposite
of God's plan

430
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,500
Where else could they be?

431
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,708
We'll find them, don't you worry

432
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,625
- Halt! Gruppenfuhrer, you'll go there!
- Yes, sir!

433
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:20,625
Georg, I need your help
Eberle is after me

434
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:21,792
Why?

435
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:25,375
After their last rally,
the Nazis arrested all party members

436
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:27,292
Come in

437
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,708
- I knew I'd find you here
- Put your hands up

438
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:38,583
What have we here?

439
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,333
We only have orders
to go after party members,

440
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,583
but soon it'll be the rest
of your Bolshevik scum

441
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,875
Take him away

442
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,875
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:53,583
Is he one of them too?

444
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,625
He's just a big-mouthed musician

445
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,167
Go inside
This is none of your business

446
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:07,500
All right, then Let's go

447
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:33,458
WITH THE STURMER AGAINST JUDAH

448
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:43,833
HARVEST FESTIVAL 1934

449
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:49,875
Flim-fum, church scum

450
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:51,792
Flim-fum, church scum

451
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,833
The Fuhrer blows up the churches

452
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,958
And all the priests will be strung up

453
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,583
Like your saviour on the cross

454
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,792
Flim-fum, church scum

455
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:02,250
Beat it, you dirty scoundrels!

456
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:03,625
Leave it, Leonhard!

457
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:13,417
Now they're even blasting things
on the Lord's day

458
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,958
OK? Well, go on

459
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,250
Hello, hello

460
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,542
Stand closer together

461
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,125
NSDAP CINEMA
SHOWING THE SHEPHERDS' RUN

462
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:05,083
- Alfred!
- Eberle!

463
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,750
Good that you could make it
Have you eaten?

464
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,417
When does it start?

465
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,125
It's about to start

466
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,292
Listen up, everyone! The screening
will start in five minutes' time

467
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,500
First come, first served

468
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,333
Let's go then

469
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:25,708
One after another

470
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,083
Like a farmer eating dumplings

471
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,125
No, no, Elmar
You have to get in line too

472
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,500
Leonhard

473
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,125
We saved you a space

474
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:45,375
I took part in the Shepherds' Run
Maybe I'm in the film

475
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,708
There's free beer and a sausage stew

476
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:52,000
We only have turnip at home,
but we're decent people

477
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:54,667
So?

478
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,333
You'll have to decide, son

479
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,875
National comrades, I'll keep it short

480
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:13,333
I know you're more excited about the film

481
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,375
than Eberle's speech

482
00:57:16,542 --> 00:57:19,625
However, today
we witness once again

483
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:22,917
how the Fuhrer brings us
technological progress

484
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:25,708
Even the most remote parts
of the German Reich

485
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,958
will see wealth and comfort

486
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:30,250
That's right Bravo!

487
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:33,583
Within three years,
we will all have our own radio set,

488
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,208
connecting us to modern times

489
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,500
I promise you,

490
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:43,500
all of the village's streets
will be paved and lit

491
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,292
This is progress

492
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:52,417
This is our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler

493
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:54,000
- Sieg
- Heil!

494
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:02,958
And now, our wonderful Shepherds' Run
as a motion picture

495
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,125
Please

496
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:58,542
Georgie

497
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:03,333
You're lucky you can still
move freely in the village

498
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,583
You claim to have organised
your own gunpowder plates

499
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,042
Where exactly did you get them from?

500
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:50,208
Before deciding
on the actual details of my plan,

501
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:53,833
I used my position at the steel works

502
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,667
to steal a total of 250 pieces
of pressed gunpowder

503
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:01,000
How do you know
it was exactly 250 pieces?

504
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:02,792
I counted them

505
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:04,500
Who else knew about this?

506
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:08,417
Nobody The theft was not
discovered by the company

507
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:12,958
I wrapped the powder in paper
and hid it in my wardrobe at home

508
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,875
And the dynamite?

509
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:18,583
I stole it from the quarry at night

510
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:22,708
What was the name of your boss?

511
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,250
I can't remember

512
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:28,667
I only met the man three or four times

513
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,875
If you don't talk,
they can have you shot,

514
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,875
any time, up there in the yard

515
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,917
It's true
I'm not covering up for anyone

516
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:43,000
Do you really think
we won't uncover everything?

517
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:45,250
No, Mr Nebe, I don't

518
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:48,125
That's why I'm
completely honest with you

519
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,375
And?

520
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:26,875
We inquire about a monumental attack
and the Swiss send this

521
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:29,958
"The proprietor describes Elser
as hard-working"

522
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:34,542
"It was noted he often left work
to go swimming in the afternoons"

523
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:38,292
"He more than made up
for the missing time in the evenings"

524
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:41,125
"We have no knowledge
of Elser's acquaintances"

525
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,500
Take your hands off your face!

526
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:07,375
Dot, dot, comma, swish,

527
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:10,375
makes a face round like a dish

528
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:11,833
What about the hair?

529
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,333
What about the ears?

530
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:25,000
Iris!

531
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,708
I found something!

532
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,875
The marshals will come on Monday
We'll have to leave our home

533
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:41,750
I sometimes wonder
how it would be with you

534
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,500
You and me together

535
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,333
You could play in an orchestra

536
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:49,625
Maybe in Switzerland

537
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:52,708
Or in America, they pay more there

538
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,167
Are you serious about me, Georgie?

539
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This might be the first time
I'm serious about anyone

540
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,958
I'm pregnant again

541
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:19,250
Don't The children mustn't find out
They talk a lot at home

542
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,625
I think it's your child

543
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:26,292
But I haven't always been able
to fend off Erich

544
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:30,417
I prayed for the Lord to take the child,
regardless of whether it's yours or his

545
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,125
You mustn't say that, Elsa

546
01:03:32,917 --> 01:03:35,292
Who will feed the child?

547
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,583
Why can't they let us be how we want?

548
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,500
You have to get a divorce

549
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,333
Am I supposed to move in with you,
now that they're taking your home?

550
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,917
Where will you live now?

551
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:28,292
Uncle! Mummy says
you'll sleep in our basement

552
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:30,167
I'm not your uncle I'm Georgie

553
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:34,667
Are you going to paint faces
and protect me from the bogeyman?

554
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:39,542
If he comes, I'll get my accordion
and play so terribly that he runs away

555
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,667
Mummy, Georgie is here

556
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:51,000
And, very important:
no female visitors Understood?

557
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:54,375
Your reputation isn't the best,
but I must protect mine

558
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,958
That's why I won't tolerate anything

559
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:07,000
So it's free board and lodging
until the furniture is finished,

560
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,458
and then 20 a month

561
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:10,833
Sign it

562
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,458
So this is it

563
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:24,625
There's a mattress in the other room
that you can have

564
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:28,750
I'll clean the window for you, Georgie
To make it brighter

565
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,958
My wife doesn't clean for lodgers

566
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,625
First we need to oil the hinges

567
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:37,375
If you can't pay

568
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:40,875
or you breach the contract,
you'll have to move out

569
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:44,167
- Understood?
- I'll always find work

570
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:50,958
Come on! Beat it!

571
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:18,292
I'M THE BIGGEST PIG AROUND
AS I MlX WITH JEWS IN TOWN

572
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:20,292
But, Lore

573
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:22,542
What's all this about?

574
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,333
You can join her if you like

575
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:33,208
Get lost!

576
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,292
It's not my birthday

577
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:53,667
I bet they wear this in Ulm,
or even in Stuttgart

578
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,208
You're crazy

579
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:00,417
Thank you

580
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:05,792
Shall I take it up like this?
Or maybe even shorter?

581
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:06,958
Shorter is nice

582
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,833
But don't wear it
when Erich's around

583
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,333
Don't worry, it's just for you

584
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:16,042
What's wrong?

585
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:21,417
They sat Lore in the square
with a sign round her neck

586
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,000
Because of her boyfriend?

587
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:25,750
Poor thing

588
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:28,583
But there's nothing we can do

589
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,792
It's getting worse and worse

590
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:51,958
Elsa

591
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:21,833
It's Schurr!

592
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,958
I can't be seen with people

593
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,708
Come on in Hurry

594
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:07,625
After the Heuberg concentration camp
they sent us to work at satellite camps

595
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:10,583
There was at least one death every week

596
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,750
- Where are you working now?
- At the steel works

597
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:19,708
I get out every two weeks for
good behaviour, but mustn't see anyone

598
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:21,083
Gosh!

599
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:27,500
And you? Out of work,
being at home at this time?

600
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:30,417
Self-employed
But it's hard, not being a Nazi

601
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,625
The steel works are hiring

602
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:35,542
But be careful
They toe the party line

603
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:38,625
There

604
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,042
You do realise we fed a camp inmate?

605
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,542
If the Gestapo come
I'll tell the pricks it's my bread

606
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:51,292
- I do what I want with it
- But you're living in our home

607
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:54,042
If the Gestapo come, we're all in for it

608
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,500
You didn't need
so many fuses to detonate the bomb

609
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:05,583
Correct I knew two or three
gunpowder plates would suffice

610
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:08,833
But I thought the extra ones
would increase the explosion

611
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,042
Why two clockworks in the bomb?

612
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:15,542
I didn't want to rely on just one
clockwork for my plan to succeed

613
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:18,125
Matching the 12 combs (B)
of cogwheel (A),

614
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:22,417
I was able to set each clock
with its run-time of 14 days

615
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:24,792
144 hours or 6 days in advance,

616
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:28,583
accurate within 15 minutes,
to the time of the explosion, 21:20,

617
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,417
and activate it

618
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:33,625
All of 13 minutes were missing

619
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:38,333
How did you build the detonator?

620
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,000
The block with the three inserted
and sharpened nails (N)

621
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:46,167
hits the bolt (U), on which it has been
loosely set, before the spring (

622
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:50,458
The tips (W) then hit
the cartridges opposite,

623
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,750
thus igniting through the impact
on the cartridge primers

624
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:58,208
the blasting caps Y,
inserted at a short distance from them

625
01:10:59,208 --> 01:11:00,583
The charge detonates

626
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,167
And?

627
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,917
This ignition head requires
a pressure of 35 kilopond

628
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,833
The spring is set to 40 kilopond
Everything matches exactly

629
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,875
This Elser works intuitively
and very accurately

630
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:27,667
Everybody knows
you need pressure to detonate

631
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:30,333
Elser must have had instructions

632
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,000
Technically, he conceived and built
the bomb all on his own

633
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:38,667
If you know all the parameters,
you don't need any help or instructions

634
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:41,125
This man knows what he's talking about

635
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:43,667
10, 15, 20

636
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,292
Come here Get lost! Beat it!

637
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,583
You're hurting me

638
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,167
You're hurting me!

639
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,167
OUR GREETING:
"HEIL HITLER!"

640
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:23,708
Josef!

641
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,958
What's the big secret they're hiding?

642
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,208
I'm not sure yet, it might be
moulds for ignition heads

643
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,625
Do you think you can
earn your money talking?

644
01:12:36,542 --> 01:12:39,875
Any contact with
the forced labourers is prohibited

645
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:45,833
Workers of the world, unite!

646
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,292
This is Radio Moscow in German
on 25m short-wave

647
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:55,042
On April26, 1937,

648
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:58,250
Adolf Hitler ordered his Condor Legion

649
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,208
to bomb the Spanish town of Guernica

650
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:04,792
Never before
has such a devastating attack

651
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,958
on a civilian target area
been witnessed

652
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:13,333
At least 260 people were shot,
torn to pieces or burned to death

653
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:17,667
Guernica's destruction is a violation of
international law and an important step

654
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:25,708
I've had it with this wretched scum

655
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:30,083
Why do they all follow this gangster?

656
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,708
They're the master race now
They think the Nazis make it better

657
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,458
Nothing's better

658
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,500
GERMAN TANKS

659
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:03,417
German domination in the air

660
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:07,750
is not just due to the outstanding
aviators of the Luftwaffe,

661
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:11,792
but also to the tremendous contributions
of the aviation industry

662
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:26,750
As Fuhrer and Chancellor
of the German nation and the Reich,

663
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:29,792
I hereby announce to German history

664
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:34,583
the accession of my homeland
to the German Reich

665
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,500
Sieg Heil!

666
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:54,292
JEWS NOT WELCOME
VILLAGE OF KONIGSBRONN

667
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,292
They want war

668
01:14:57,458 --> 01:15:00,417
It'll be brutal
They're building tanks as piecework

669
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,792
Maybe it'll be like Bohemia and Moravia

670
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:05,542
With Hitler attacking
England and France?

671
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:08,125
We'll all die and the country with us

672
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:10,000
I'm a forced labourer, Georgie

673
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:11,833
We really ought to do something

674
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,208
But what?
Blow up the Special Unit?

675
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,625
That would only mean dead workers
and the Nazis would carry on

676
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:21,958
We have to do something else,
and soon

677
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,833
Soon and radical

678
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,458
Attack the leadership

679
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,292
You'll need guns or dynamite

680
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:33,167
There's dynamite up in the quarry
and detonators here in the factory

681
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:38,042
- Someone has to stop this madness
- Yes, but not you or me or us

682
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:41,708
Hitler must be stopped
by other countries, by generals

683
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,667
We're not strong enough, Georg

684
01:15:44,292 --> 01:15:46,542
We can't wait till it's too late

685
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,208
It has to happen

686
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,667
What's wrong?

687
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,542
I can't stand you
doing it with this drunkard

688
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,750
There's nothing I can do

689
01:16:44,042 --> 01:16:45,167
You filthy whore!

690
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,625
You slut!

691
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,042
Just one more, you swine,
just one more

692
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,250
I'll kill you

693
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:03,750
I'll kill you, both of you

694
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,708
Both of you

695
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:14,042
Elsa?

696
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,792
How's the child?

697
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:23,125
- It's kicking
- Thank God

698
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:25,958
What happens now?

699
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,167
This here is over
Just come with me

700
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,917
Where to? To your mother?

701
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,167
So we all go to heaven?

702
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,875
There's no room for me there

703
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:44,458
I now work piece rate
It's better money

704
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:47,458
It'll be enough
if I repair furniture on the side

705
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:51,042
There are cheap flats
in Heidenheim now

706
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,292
Only for Labour Front workers

707
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,542
Not for you

708
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,833
BURGERBRAU ADDRESS
THE FUHRER SPEAKS!

709
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:43,458
THE FUHRER SPEAKS

710
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,958
TIMETABLE

711
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:33,917
MUNICH 1938

712
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:39,208
We've checked everything

713
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:23,750
A talented worker such as yourself
should be a staunch National Socialist

714
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:27,042
It's obvious that the Nazis
don't support the people

715
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:30,375
Today, a carpenter's hourly wage
is 68 Pfennigs

716
01:21:30,542 --> 01:21:33,042
In 1929 it was 1 Mark and 5

717
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:37,792
You're not trying to tell us that our
Fuhrer isn't looking after workers

718
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,125
Hitler is bad for Germany

719
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:43,625
- Have you gone completely insane?
- It's true though

720
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:46,542
He's sending dissenters
to concentration camps

721
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:50,708
And the Jews are being robbed and
tortured just because of their faith

722
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,500
To cleanse the population

723
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,583
Your blitzkrieg was a brutal attack

724
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:57,667
Poland will be annihilated,
Hitler will incorporate it

725
01:21:57,833 --> 01:21:59,292
That's the law of the strongest

726
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,375
It's always been like this

727
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,250
Do you really think
there'll be no consequences?

728
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:09,000
France and England
declared war on us on September 3rd

729
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:13,208
Soon, a terrible fire will steamroll
Germany and destroy everything

730
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,625
Endless amounts of blood will be shed

731
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:18,208
Then the bombs will drop on us, too

732
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:21,542
Can't you see what's happening?

733
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:24,917
You're suffering from paranoia

734
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,917
And what about the victims?

735
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:29,500
Hitler always talks about destiny

736
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:33,292
So you National Socialists, too,
must have a higher law

737
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:35,292
And it states, "thou shalt not kill"

738
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:40,250
That's rich, coming from someone
who murdered eight innocent people

739
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:44,917
Yes, you heard right

740
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:48,417
Last night,
the injured Schmeidel died as well

741
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,333
I only wanted to prevent
even more bloodshed

742
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,792
I knew it would not just hit
the highest ranks

743
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,667
But it had to be done

744
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:09,208
All right, take this down

745
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:13,458
The considerations I undertook

746
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:19,750
led to the conclusion
that conditions in Germany

747
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:27,083
could only be changed by extinguishing
the current leadership

748
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,917
I said the highest ranks

749
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,625
Very well, the highest ranks, then

750
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:33,375
By this, I mean

751
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:38,458
By this, I mean Hitler
and all the government

752
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:40,292
I am the sole perpetrator

753
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:44,792
I procured the necessary means
for the attack on my own

754
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:48,667
I was working entirely alone

755
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,417
Correct

756
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:54,833
And, funnily enough,
nobody would have joined me

757
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,083
You will regret this, Elser

758
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:15,458
Miss Secretary,
may I ask you something?

759
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,958
You're not allowed

760
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:19,625
I know you're not wholly unmoved

761
01:24:19,792 --> 01:24:20,917
Please

762
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:28,667
I would be grateful if you could
pass on my condolences to the relatives,

763
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:30,750
my heartfelt condolences

764
01:24:30,917 --> 01:24:32,958
I think about them all day

765
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:39,500
And, if possible, tell Elsa and my family
that I'm well at the moment

766
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,333
And that I'm praying
for the Lord to protect them

767
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,917
And that I accept
sole responsibility for everything

768
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,542
Could you pass that on, please?

769
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:59,167
You can't get any more out of him
than the truth

770
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:03,167
We make the truth

771
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,083
You're not normally so soft

772
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,542
It's from the file Put it away
You didn't get it from me

773
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:35,042
That'll do for today

774
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:38,042
Take him away

775
01:25:38,792 --> 01:25:40,417
Thank you

776
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,875
And, what did you have, a boy?

777
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,958
A boy He's ours

778
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,250
I can see it

779
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,625
I already told Erich
he'll be called Georg

780
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:28,292
He was shouting

781
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:31,083
But I signed the midwife's certificate

782
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:53,083
- You get some rest now
- Stay

783
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,958
Erich has gone drinking

784
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:57,250
I have to get to work, Elsa

785
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,333
The prisoner to the left, please,
with the gentlemen at the table

786
01:28:39,792 --> 01:28:41,792
The Oberfuhrer on the left, please

787
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:47,667
If the prisoner could point
to the schematic, please

788
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:50,833
And if the Oberfuhrer
could bend down a little, please

789
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,750
You stated the Fuhrer was bad
for Germany

790
01:29:03,917 --> 01:29:04,917
That's right

791
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:08,792
Heil Hitler! Heil the Fuhrer!

792
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:12,458
Our Fuhrer made Germany great
and will lead us on to glory

793
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:16,167
He is the greatest leader
and won't die until our destiny is fulfilled

794
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:18,792
What is a worm like you
to do with such a man?

795
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:21,542
What lunatic has controlled you,
you imbecile?

796
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:24,542
It's like I said

797
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:49,208
The Fuhrer demands to know
who instigated this fool to act

798
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:52,042
Have him hypnotised,
drug him, I don't care

799
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:55,875
Use any means that our scientists
have been working on

800
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:58,833
The Fuhrer wants to know who set it up

801
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,625
He wants to know who's behind this

802
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:03,667
His patience has run out

803
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:22,042
I could stay with my mother
for a while after the divorce

804
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,083
What do you think?

805
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,333
She'll have the children
There's work in Esslingen

806
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,083
You can come down
from Munich on weekends

807
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:39,708
I must know
if you really want this, Georgie

808
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:43,458
I love you

809
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,375
Elsa

810
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:50,500
The boy

811
01:33:01,167 --> 01:33:02,625
Georgie!

812
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:05,208
Georgie

813
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,833
So you're off to Munich

814
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,958
Without a goodbye, just like that

815
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:17,042
Don't move

816
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,875
So you do have something in Munich

817
01:33:32,042 --> 01:33:33,458
And it's decided?

818
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:36,500
It's just for a short while

819
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:39,000
I love you, Georgie,
but I have no choice

820
01:33:40,167 --> 01:33:42,500
I can take a lot,
but the children are hungry

821
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:45,042
I'd give you money,
but I need it for Munich

822
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:49,750
Elsa, wait for me. Be faithful to me

823
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,667
I've got something planned

824
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:56,000
I can't tell you what,
but it's vital, and it'll be fine

825
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:00,167
I want to marry you when it's all over

826
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:03,458
We'll move to Switzerland
with the children

827
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,208
Think of the dancing

828
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:06,958
It's not about dreams

829
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,083
It's about life, Georgie

830
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:13,958
I know you left women before me

831
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:19,583
Then I'll just have to be
a single mother forever

832
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:42,583
I can't hear what you're saying

833
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,583
Tell us the names

834
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:48,792
The names

835
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:51,750
No

836
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:11,125
The name!
Who provided the cartridges?

837
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,958
Who supplied the explosives?

838
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,250
I can't hear you

839
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:21,833
You bastard!

840
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:28,667
The names, Elser! Tell us the names!

841
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:31,667
Heil! Heil! Heil!

842
01:35:31,833 --> 01:35:33,208
I did it on my own

843
01:35:34,417 --> 01:35:36,542
Nobody helped me

844
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:48,500
I shall try and atone

845
01:35:48,667 --> 01:35:52,750
for the bad things that I have done

846
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,833
By doing what?

847
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,500
And how?

848
01:35:58,958 --> 01:36:01,250
By trying to

849
01:36:03,417 --> 01:36:06,208
By trying to integrate myself into

850
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:11,833
the national community
and work within it

851
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:14,958
Would you be able to?

852
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,833
I changed my conviction

853
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:25,417
Because you were arrested

854
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,667
No

855
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:33,708
I'm certain
my plan would have succeeded,

856
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:37,417
if my conviction had been right

857
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:41,667
Since it hasn't succeeded,

858
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,375
I'm convinced
it wasn't meant to succeed

859
01:36:47,542 --> 01:36:50,375
and that my conviction was wrong

860
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,625
Take him away

861
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,875
Can I see a priest?

862
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:08,292
No

"The former SS Gruppenfuhrer and

Nebe was executed a few days ago

Did you hear me? Nebe's dead

At Plotzensee

881
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:44,667
- How do you know?
- From the new inmates, as usual

882
01:41:46,042 --> 01:41:49,375
They strung up Nebe? Why?

883
01:41:49,542 --> 01:41:54,292
He designated policemen for Stauffenberg
to arrest all ministers after the coup

884
01:41:56,708 --> 01:42:00,500
So much for the great show trial
that Goebbels wanted to put on for you

885
01:42:01,417 --> 01:42:04,208
It'll soon be over for me, too

886
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:06,792
At least you got
a few more years out of them

887
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:13,083
If only I knew what happened to Elsa

888
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:16,167
You keep asking about that woman
How should I know?

889
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:18,250
With so many people dying

890
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:20,875
She's not necessarily dead

891
01:42:21,667 --> 01:42:24,375
She might be alive,
imprisoned somewhere

01:42:26,542 --> 01:42:27,958
There's also good news

893
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,792
The College of Music for the Disabled
has accepted me

894
01:42:31,958 --> 01:42:33,750
I'll learn how to sing now

895
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,375
Viennese songs for zither

896
01:42:39,542 --> 01:42:43,583
As a little thank-you for recommending
I try the College of Music

897
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:52,292
You were young

898
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,667
I was young

899
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:58,542
Now it's all gone

900
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,792
Only the memories

901
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:10,125
Are all that carries on

902
01:43:10,292 --> 01:43:12,542
You were pretty

903
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:14,958
I was smart

904
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:19,417
And so in love

905
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:24,125
Think back to the places

906
01:43:24,292 --> 01:43:27,958
To the sweetest faces

907
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:33,333
Just because there 's nothing
you can place above

908
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:42,375
Franz, you know about these things

909
01:43:42,542 --> 01:43:44,958
What's quicker:

910
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:49,042
gas, hanging,
or being shot in the neck?

911
01:43:54,958 --> 01:43:57,000
I've been waiting for so long

912
01:43:58,542 --> 01:44:01,125
It might as well be over quickly

913
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,333
hallowed be thy name

914
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,292
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

915
01:44:08,417 --> 01:44:10,833
on earth as it is in heaven

916
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,708
Give us this day our daily bread,

917
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:15,000
and forgive us our trespasses

918
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:17,583
The English reduced Dresden to rubble

919
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:20,000
Not one building is left standing

920
01:44:20,167 --> 01:44:22,792
One hundred thousand civilians
killed in one night

921
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:24,167
For thine is the kingdom

922
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:25,750
Praying is pointless

923
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:27,917
God is in America or in Moscow
He won't hear you

924
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:34,083
How can one man fail as horribly as I?

925
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Prisoner Elser,

926
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:41,708
for interrogation!

927
01:45:05,667 --> 01:45:09,292
During one of the next terror attacks
on Munich or the Dachau area,

928
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:11,292
Elser will allegedly
suffer a fatal accident

929
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:18,542
I therefore ask you to secretly liquidate
Elser when this situation arises

930
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:25,083
Make sure that only very few specially
selected personnel know about this

931
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:29,000
The incident report filed to me
should read along the lines of:

932
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:31,625
"On ( ), following
the terror attack on ( ),

933
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:35,500
"special prisoner Elser,
among others, was fatally injured "

934
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:39,000
You must destroy this letter once
you have taken note and carried this out

935
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:11,625
A FEW DAYS LATER,
ON APRIL 29, 1945,

936
01:46:11,792 --> 01:46:13,833
THE DACHAU CONCENTRATION CAMP
WAS LIBERATED

937
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,625
STARTED BY HITLER,

938
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:19,125
THE SECOND WORLD WAR
CLAIMED AT LEAST 55 MILLION LIVES

939
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:23,375
IT TOOK DECADES FOR GERMANY

940
01:46:23,542 --> 01:46:26,500
TO RECOGNISE GEORG ELSER
AS A RESISTANCE FIGHTER

941
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:30,000
FOLLOWING HER DIVORCE,

942
01:46:30,167 --> 01:46:32,958
ELSA WAS MARRIED
TWO MORE TIMES

943
01:46:33,125 --> 01:46:35,708
SHE DIED IN WIESENSTEIG
ON OCTOBER 11, 1994

944
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:39,000
SHE NEVER GOT OVER GEORG ELSER,
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE

945
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:07,417
13 MINUTES

946
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,417
THIS FILM WAS BASED
ON HISTORICAL EVENTS

947
01:49:17,583 --> 01:49:19,417
SOME SCENES FROM
GEORG ELSER'S PERSONAL LIFE

948
01:49:19,583 --> 01:49:20,917
WERE FICTIONALISED
