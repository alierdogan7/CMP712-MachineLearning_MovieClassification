00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,836
BOMBARDIERS.

20
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:29,272
MAJOR ROBERTS,
WHAT ABOUT AMMUNITION?

21
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:30,673
NO AMMUNITION.

22
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:33,442
ARE WE TAKING
BOMBSIGHTS, SIR?

23
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,745
WE'RE FERRYING THEM
FULLY EQUIPPED

24
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,481

PILOTS, CHECK WITH
MAINTENANCE ON THAT.

26
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,452
HARPER,
YOU'LL CHECK OURS.

27
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:44,287
THAT'S IT.

28
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:47,189
THE CREWS DON'T KNOW
THE DESTINATION,

29
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:49,459
SO KEEP IT QUIET.

30
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,894
HOW ABOUT PHONING
OUR WIVES?

31
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:53,796

00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,769
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT
INTEREST YOU, McMARTIN.

35
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:04,008
YES, SIR.

36
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,075

00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,762
PUT A NEW MAGNETO

42
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:29,298
THEY DIDN'T TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

43
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,435
THEY DIDN'T, HUH?

44
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,771
CAN YOU KEEP
A SECRET?

45
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:35,839
YES, SIR.

46
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,675
THAT'S GOOD!

47
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,543
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON,

00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,979

HI.

52
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,152
GLAD YOU'RE
WITH US, CHESTER.

53
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:51,187
I'VE WANTED
TO GET ON A FLYING FORTRESS

54
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,959
EVER SINCE
RADIO SCHOOL.

55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,260
WHEN WAS THAT?

56
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,128
THREE MONTHS
AGO, SIR.

57
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,997
TURN HIM OVER
TO PETERSON, SERGEANT.

58
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,100
HE CAN LOOK OVER
THE RADIO SET.

59
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,204
YES, SIR.

60
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,673
PETERSON'S
INSIDE, SON.

61
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,574
MUST BE A BIG FLIGHT--
NINE FORTRESSES.

62
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:13,711
SO THEY SAY.

63
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:16,579
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

64
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,249
CAN YOU
KEEP A SECRET?

65
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,786
YES, SIR.

66
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,220
THAT'S GOOD.

67
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:30,093
HELLO.

68
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:32,129
ARE YOU THE NEW GUNNER?

69
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,298
NO, SECOND RADIO.

70
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,599
I'M WEINBERG,
SECOND ENGINEER.

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,900
I'M CHESTER.
GLAD TO KNOW YOU.

72
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,969
IS THAT WHAT SHE'S
CALLED, MARY-ANN?

73
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,072
YES. BEST SHIP
IN THE OUTFIT.

74
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,176
PETERSON, HERE'S
YOUR NEW RADIO.

75
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:47,712
HOW ARE YOU?

76
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,280
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND.

77
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,419
ARE YOU THE CREW CHIEF?

78
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,920
YEAH,
MY NAME'S WHITE.

79
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,990
ARE YOU THE NEW GUNNER?

80
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,491
YEAH.
JOE WINOCKI.

81
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,160
PUT YOUR STUFF INSIDE.

82
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,927
YOU'RE LUCKY.

83
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,428
OUR GUNNER'S
ON FURLOUGH.

84
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:07,097
I WOULDN'T SAY
I'M LUCKY.

85
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,696
LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING'S O.K.

86
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,564
HOW ABOUT THE COFFEE
AND SANDWICHES?

87
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,532
GOT THEM.

88
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,168
I WISH WE HAD
EXTRA OXYGEN.

89
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,837
ALREADY INSIDE
THE PLANE.

90
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,438
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

91
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,306
SIX BOTTLES.

92
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,575
GOT AN EXTRA ENGINE?

93
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,509
ALMOST ENOUGH PARTS
FOR ONE.

94
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,079
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY WIFE.

95
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,347
SHE SHOULD
BE HERE.

96
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,181
WINOCKI?

97
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,684
HE'S OUR NEW GUNNER.

98
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,552
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON.

99
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,821
DON'T I KNOW YOU,
SERGEANT?

100
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,122
I THINK SO, SIR.

101
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,390
YOU WERE AT
RANDOLPH FIELD?

102
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,159
2 1/2 YEARS AGO.

103
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,495
WHILE I WAS
INSTRUCTING THERE?

104
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,397
OH, I REMEMBER--

105
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,032
I THINK
YOU REMEMBER.

106
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,700
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?

107
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,102
NOT NOW, NO.

108
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,208
I GUESS THAT
NEW RADIO MAN

109
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,946
IS A GOOD KID.

110
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,847
YEAH.

111
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,248
WE'RE GETTING THEM

112
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,851
RIGHT OFF
THE BOTTLE NOW.

113
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,453
HOW OLD
IS YOUR KID?

114
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,421
21.

115
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,022
WHERE'S HE
STATIONED?

116
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,591
CLARK FIELD, MANILA.

117
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,460
JUST GOT A BOOST.

118
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,462
IF HE GETS
ANOTHER BAR,

119
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,430
YOU'LL NEED
A BIGGER HAT.

120
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,566
IMAGINE ME SALUTING
MY OWN KID.

121
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,601
YOU'D PIN HIS EARS DOWN
IF HE DIDN'T TAKE IT.

122
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,206
EXCUSE ME, SIR,

123
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,007
MY MOTHER WOULD LIKE
TO MEET YOU.

124
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,911
SURE.

125
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,757
MOTHER, THIS IS
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON.

126
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,426
HOW DO YOU DO?

127
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,228
MIGHTY NICE OF YOU
TO SEE US OFF.

128
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,200
I WANTED TO MEET YOU

129
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,468
BECAUSE I WONDERED
WHAT KIND--

130
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,970
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

131
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,407
HE'LL BE
LOOKING AFTER ME.

132
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,242
THAT'S HOW
A BOMBER CREW FUNCTIONS.

133
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,745
DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

134
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,948
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
CHESTER.

135
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,682
IT'S A ROUTINE FLIGHT.

136
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,751
THANKS.

137
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,952
GOOD-BYE.

138
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,320
GOOD-BYE.

139
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,993
I'LL WRITE
TO YOU, MOM,

140
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,361
SO YOU'LL KNOW
WHERE I AM.

141
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,063
DID YOU BRING THIS
FOR ME?

142
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,133
OH.

143
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,173
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, MOM.

144
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,975
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

145
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,412
GOOD-BYE, SON.

146
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,847
GOOD-BYE, MOM.

147
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,619
SEEN MRS. QUINCANNON?

148
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,185
NO.

149
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,887
I GUESS
I'VE BEEN DITCHED.

150
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,524
GET ABOARD,
CHESTER.

151
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,127
IRISH!

152
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:24,997
IRISH!

153
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,866
ABOUT TIME,
MRS. QUINCANNON.

154
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,468
WHAT HAPPENED?

155
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:30,102
FLAT TIRE.

156
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,071
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH
I WOULDN'T MAKE IT.

157
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,675
I COULDN'T
BRING MICHAEL.

158
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,242
HE SENT YOU THIS--

159
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,645
AND THIS.

160
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,014
THANK YOU.

161
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,516
COULDN'T I
STOW AWAY?

162
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,385
I'D GET
COURT-MARTIALED.

163
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,519
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

164
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,587
WE'LL TAKE
THAT HONEYMOON.

165
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,622
I REMEMBER
EVERY HONEYMOON WE DIDN'T HAVE,

166
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,392
EVEN THE FIRST ONE.

167
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,427
YOU HAVEN'T
GOT MUCH CHANCE

168
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,962
TO BE BORED WITH ME.

169
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,830
I NEVER GET BORED
WITH YOU, IRISH.

170
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,500
IT'S BEEN FUN.

171
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,001
I GUESS I'M LUCKY.

172
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,637
ME, TOO.

173
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,340
IRISH,
YOU'LL REMEMBER

174
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,142
TO WEAR YOUR RUBBERS
IN THE RAIN?

175
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,212
SURE I WILL.

176
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,680
I'LL BE WAITING.

177
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,020
SO LONG, KID.

178
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,194
BETTER STOW THIS
OVER THERE, SERGEANT.

179
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,696
YES, SIR.

180
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,531
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

181
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,533
GET THAT LADDER ABOARD,
WILL YOU, WEINBERG?

182
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,536
O.K.

183
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:53,486
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

184
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,321
YOU NEVER KNOW

00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:05,598
YES.

190
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,734
CONTROLS?

191
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:07,267

WE NEED

201
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,700

204
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,615
TAKEOFF INSTRUCTIONS
FOR FLIGHT OF 9 B-17s.

205
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:59,652
SIR, IS THIS
A LOCAL FLIGHT?

206
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:01,388
NO.

207
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,357
O.K. TO TAXI UP
TO NORTH END OF RAMP.

208
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,028

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,167
ROBERTS TO FLIGHT.

212
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,668

LET'S GO.

217
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:15,824
LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL
RUN ALL RIGHT.

218
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,058
THANK YOU, SIR.

219
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,126
CHECK THE
TAIL WHEEL, ROBBIE.

220
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,495
YES, SIR.

221
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:24,499
I'M GOING
UPSTAIRS.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,200
O.K.

223
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:27,801
DON'T
GET US LOST.

224
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,077
WANT ANY HELP
RUNNING THIS THING?

225
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:38,680
HI, TOMMY.
HOW'S MONK?

226
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,215
KNEE-DEEP IN MAPS.

227
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:49,290
LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT YOUR DATE.

228
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:51,360
WATCH OUT, TOMMY.

229
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:54,095
HE'LL BE
YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.

230
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:57,165
SUSAN WON'T MARRY
BENEATH HERSELF.

231
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,833
YOU CAN'T
MAKE ME MAD.

232
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,436
TAKE A LAST LOOK.

233
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:11,280
GOOD-BYE,
SAN FRANCISCO.

234
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:13,747
HELLO, HONOLULU.

235
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:16,818
THERE'S THE GOLDEN GATE.

236
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:20,422
SAN FRANCISCO'S
A BIG TOWN.

237
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:22,858
STRICTLY
A ONE-WHISTLE STOP.

238
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:25,692
THERE'S ONLY
ONE CITY IN THE USA--

239
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:28,196
AND THAT'S NEW YORK.

240
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:30,032
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH CALIFORNIA?

241
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:30,532
CALIFORNIA?

242
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,467
THE SUN SHINES AND
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.

243
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:35,805
NEW YORK'S
NO DIFFERENT.

244
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,673
MY SISTER'S TRIED
TO LEAVE BROOKLYN

245
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,643
FOR 40 YEARS.

246
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:42,311
BROOKLYN
AIN'T NEW YORK.

247
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,479
ONCE YOU CROSS
BROOKLYN BRIDGE,

248
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,615
YOU'VE LEFT
THIS WORLD.

249
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:49,517
I KNEW SOMEONE WHO
CROSSED IT IN 1929.

250
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:53,556
AIN'T HEARD
FROM HIM SINCE.

251
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:54,790
I'LL TAKE
MINNEAPOLIS.

252
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,725
MINNEAPOLIS! THAT AIN'T
YOUR HOME TOWN.

253
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:00,862
THE HAYSEED'S
STILL IN YOUR HAIR.

254
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:04,031
YEAH. BUT I CAN STILL
MILK A COW.

255
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,302
I'LL GET MINE
OUT OF A BOTTLE.

256
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:10,204
THAT'S THE CLOSEST
I'LL GET TO A COW.

257
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,208
YOU'RE HANDY
WITH THE BULL.

258
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,244
WE'RE SURE LUCKY.

259
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,079
WHY?

260
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,647
THIS WHOLE TRIP.

261
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,915
WHAT ABOUT IT?

262
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,049
A MILLION FELLOWS

263
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,852
WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO BE HERE.

264
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:24,620
WHY?

265
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:26,389
NOT JUST THIS FLIGHT,

266
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,391
BUT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

267
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,827
HOW FAR DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL GET

268
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:35,564
AS AN ENLISTED MAN?

269
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,300
LOOK AT THE TRAINING
YOU GET.

270
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:41,803
IF YOU DON'T GO THROUGH
FLYING SCHOOL,

271
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:44,039
YOU DON'T RATE.

272
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,242
WHAT ARE YOU
IN IT FOR?

273
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:48,611
I'M GETTING OUT
NEXT MONTH.

274
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:50,146
YOU'RE GETTING OUT?

275
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:51,180
YEP.

276
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,448
WELL, I'M NOT.

277
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:55,217
STICK TO WHAT
YOU BELIEVE IN.

278
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:57,553
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

279
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:00,422
WHAT'LL YOU BE
IN 20 YEARS, SERGEANT,

280
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:02,558
A BRIGADIER?

281
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:05,060
NO, BUT MY BOY IS.

282
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:07,196
WE LIKE THE AIR CORPS.

283
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:10,198
STAY IN THE BOX, SON,
AND KEEP ON PITCHING.

284
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:13,769
YEAH.

285
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,438
COMING UP
FORWARD, KID?

286
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:23,179
YEAH.

287
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,780
KEEP RIGHT ON PITCHING.

288
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,098
EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT?

289
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,499
FINE.

290
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,168
COFFEE, CAPTAIN?

291
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,502
PLEASE.

292
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,808
THANKS, SERGEANT.

293
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,176
YES, SIR.

294
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:58,814
YOU WANT
SOME COFFEE, WINOCKI?

295
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:00,517
NO, THANKS.

296
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,085
HOW'S IT GOING?

297
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,419
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

298
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,088
I WANT TO TALK
WITH YOU.

299
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,891
CAN I TALK, TOO?

300
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:08,291
SURE.

301
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,193
I WANT TO GET THINGS
STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

302
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:14,897
I'M STRAIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

303
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,368
I KNOW WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU.

304
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:21,136
YOU WANTED TO FLY,
DIDN'T YOU?

305
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,206
WHO DOESN'T?

306
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,208
YOU BLEW YOUR CHANCE.

307
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,110
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK.

308
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,945
NO, YOU COULDN'T
MAKE IT.

309
00:18:28,946 --> 00:18:30,814
WHEN THE GOING
GOT TOUGH--

310
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,516
YOU THREW ME UP
FOR GRABS.

311
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,618
RUNNING INTO
DRISCOLL'S PLANE WAS AN ACCIDENT--

312
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:39,255
FOR WHICH YOU WASHED ME
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.

313
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,694
THE BOARD
WASHED YOU OUT.

314
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:46,430
ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION.

315
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:47,797
YOU LACKED FLYING ABILITY,

316
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:49,599
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
ELIMINATED SOONER.

317
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,135
NOBODY HOLDS YOU
RESPONSIBLE

318
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:52,802
FOR DRISCOLL'S DEATH.

319
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,371
EXCEPT YOU.

320
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,506
NOT ME EITHER.

321
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,574
TWO OTHER MEN ON THIS SHIP
WASHED OUT AS PILOTS--

322
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:03,179
McMARTIN'S A BOMBARDIER,
HAUSER'S A NAVIGATOR.

323
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:04,981
THEY'RE BOTH GOOD.

324
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,250
YOU'RE A GOOD GUNNER.

325
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:09,285
WE NEED YOU, JUST LIKE
WE NEED THE WHOLE GANG.

326
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,955
IT TAKES ALL OF US
TO MAKE THIS SHIP FUNCTION.

327
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:15,526
WE"" ALL
"" BELONG TO THIS AIRPLANE.

328
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:18,794
EVERY MAN RELIES
ON EVERY OTHER MAN TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

329
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:22,066
YOU'VE PLAYED
FOOTBALL, WINOCKI.

330
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,001
YOU'LL PLAY BALL
WITH US,

331
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,802
OR I'LL HAVE TO
GET RID OF YOU.

332
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:30,974
NICE SPEECH,
BUT MY ENLISTMENT RUNS OUT SOON.

333
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:34,778
YOU'RE QUITTING, HUH?

334
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,146
YES, SIR.

335
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:38,916
THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE,

336
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:41,885
BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU'RE STILL IN THE ARMY.

337
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:44,855
YES, SIR.

338
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:47,557
I'M SORRY FOR YOU,
WINOCKI.

339
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:49,260
ANYTHING ELSE?

340
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,660
THAT'S ALL.

341
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,968
PETERSON, IF YOU
WANT ENTERTAINMENT,

342
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:59,369
TUNE IN ON THE BROADCAST
FREQUENCIES.

343
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,872

00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,206
HEY, THEY
AIN'T KIDDING.

546
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,942
DID YOU SEE
THAT BUMBLEBEE?

547
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:21,591
LOCK THEM.

548
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,925
LOCKED.

549
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,752
CHECK THE TANKS

550
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:52,388
AND SEE
IF THEY'VE BEEN HIT.

551
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:54,790
YES, SIR.

552
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:06,202
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME ALONE.

553
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:07,069
ALL RIGHT.

554
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,471
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

555
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:09,539
I OWE YOU ONE.

556
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,308
HOW FAR WOULD YOU
HAVE GOTTEN?

557
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:15,444
THEY'D HAVE
CUT YOU DOWN OUT THERE.

558
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,847
INSTEAD, YOU DID.

559
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:20,615
A FEW SHOTS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE

560
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:24,253
COULD HAVE
SET THIS SHIP AFIRE.

561
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:27,389
WINOCKI, STOP TRYING
TO PROVE SOMETHING.

562
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:29,959
MY JOB IS TAILGUNNER.

563
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,694
WHAT'S YOURS? LECTURING?

564
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:34,629
NO, MY JOB IS TO KEEP
THIS THING FLYING.

565
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:45,975
O5564 TO HICKAM FIELD.

566
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,048
05564 TO HICKAM FIELD.

567
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:53,116
SHUT OFF YOUR RADIO!

568
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:54,951
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

569
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:57,854
JUST CLEARED FIELD--
HAVE TO COME NOW.

570
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:01,057
O.K. CALL JUST BEFORE
YOU ARRIVE.

571
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:03,959
ROGER.

572
00:33:29,787 --> 00:33:31,522
PILOT TO CREW,

573
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,223
LOOK AT PEARL HARBOR.

574
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:36,158
IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL
WANT TO REMEMBER.

575
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:46,703
DAMN THEM.

576
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:47,571
DAMN THEM!

577
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:50,673
NOW AIN'T YOU GLAD YOU'RE
GETTING OUT OF THE ARMY?

578
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,309
05564 TO HICKAM.

579
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,411
APPROACHING FIELD
FROM THE SOUTH FOR LANDING.

580
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:31,648
CAN'T GIVE YOU LIGHTS.

581
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,583
ROGER.

582
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:34,585
TAKE THE WEST SIDE.

583
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,887
WATCH FOR BOMB CRATERS.

584
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,256
GOOD LUCK.

585
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:40,124
ROGER.
PILOT TO CREW,

586
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,260
FASTEN YOUR
SAFETY BELTS--

587
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,927
MIGHT BE
A ROUGH LANDING.

588
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,364
ALL SET.

589
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:48,632
ALL CHECKED
FOR LANDING.

590
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,734
GIVE ME FULL FLAPS.

591
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,236
FLAPS COMING DOWN.

592
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,143
LANDING LIGHTS.

593
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:00,544
LIGHTS.

594
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,813
AIR SPEED, 110.

595
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:05,081
100.

596
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:43,915
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON,
SIR.

597
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,884
HOW ARE YOU,
CAPTAIN?

598
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:48,586
YOU WERE TOLD
TO STAY PUT.

599
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:51,688
WE WERE BEING
SHOT AT BY SNIPERS.

600
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,226
WE DIDN'T WANT TO
LOSE THE AIRPLANE.

601
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:58,597
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

602
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:01,432
WE'VE GOT OUR
TROUBLES HERE, TOO.

603
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:02,734
YES, SIR.

604
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:05,569
THEY CERTAINLY
DID A COMPLETE JOB.

605
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:08,706
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE P-40s?

606
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:11,708
THREE VEGETABLE TRUCKS
ARRIVED FROM HONOLULU.

607
00:37:12,278 --> 00:37:15,080
WHEN THE FIRST JAP
PLANES SHOWED,

608
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:18,282
THE TRUCKS SMASHED
THE TAILS OFF EVERY SHIP ON LINE.

609
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:23,488
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS McMARTIN?

610
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:24,823
ME, SIR.

611
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:27,591
YOU'RE WANTED
AT THE HOSPITAL.

612
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:29,194
MY SISTER?

613
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:32,163
SHE ASKED FOR WILLIAMS
AND QUINCANNON, TOO.

614
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,867
WE WANT YOUR SHIP
SERVICED IMMEDIATELY.

615
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:38,170
ANY REPAIRS NEEDED?

616
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:40,939
THERE'S A WHEEL
TO BE CHECKED.

617
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,442
THESE MEN WILL HELP.

618
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:46,243
SERGEANT, YOU HEARD
THE COLONEL.

619
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,080
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?

620
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:49,915
WHO'S YOUR NAVIGATOR?

621
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,316
LIEUTENANT HAUSER.

622
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:53,819
I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU.

623
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,821
BEG YOUR PARDON,
SIR.

624
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:57,022
HELLO, SERGEANT.

625
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:59,891
DID THEY ATTACK
CLARK FIELD, MANILA?

626
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:02,360
MY BOY'S THERE.

627
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,163
YES, THEY HIT IT.

628
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:06,931
HIT EVERYTHING
IN THE PACIFIC--

629
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,968
GUAM, WAKE, MIDWAY.

630
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:10,936
I REMEMBER YOUR BOY.

631
00:38:10,937 --> 00:38:12,505
HE'S A
FIRST LIEUTENANT,

632
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:13,105
FLIGHT COMMANDER.

633
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:15,974
HE'S A GOOD PILOT THEN.
DON'T WORRY.

634
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,844
THANK YOU, SIR.

635
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:21,546
FELLOWS,
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

636
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:26,486
MISS McMARTIN?

637
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:29,087
RIGHT DOWN
THAT WAY.

638
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,692
I CAN'T SEE.

639
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:35,393
IT'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

640
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:39,564
BUT I CAN'T SEE.

641
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,033
I CAN'T SEE.

642
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:42,034
LIEUTENANT McMARTIN,

643
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:44,836
YOU CAN ONLY STAY
A FEW MINUTES.

644
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:48,473
SURE.

645
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,886
SUE.

646
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,057
HELLO, KID.

647
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:06,858
WHY, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU BOYS.

648
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:12,264
I WAS KIND OF SCARED,

649
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:14,567
ACTED LIKE A NINNY.

650
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,536
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU HAD A FLAT TIRE

651
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,607
OR COULDN'T FIND THE PLACE.

652
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,780
OH, TOMMY, BILL,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

653
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:33,485
GOD, IT HURTS WHEN I CRY.

654
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:36,621
DON'T, SUE.

655
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:40,159
I WANTED TO
TELL YOU ABOUT...

656
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:46,364
I GUESS
I'M KIND OF TIRED.

657
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:48,968
HE'LL TELL YOU.

658
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,103
WHO?

659
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:52,571
TEX. TEX RAIDER.

660
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:55,776
DON'T GET MAD ANYMORE.

661
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:56,810
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

662
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,779
HE TRIED GETTING ME
OUT OF THE CAR, BUT...

663
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:04,482
I GUESS HE'D
BETTER TELL YOU.

664
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:06,319
SURE.

665
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,088
WILL YOU COME
IN THE MORNING?

666
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,224
YOU BET.

667
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:16,195
GOOD NIGHT.

668
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,205
SERGEANT, WHERE CAN WE
FIND LIEUTENANT RAIDER?

669
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,208
THIS WAY.

670
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,326
RAIDER.

671
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:47,660
RAIDER.

672
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:49,596
OH, HELLO,
TOMMY.

673
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:51,131
HOW ARE YOU,
BILL?

674
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,799
I GUESS
I WENT TO SLEEP.

675
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,836
WE JUST CAME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

676
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:59,938
SUPPOSE YOU DO
A LITTLE EXPLAINING.

677
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,008
WHAT IS THIS,
THE THIRD DEGREE?

678
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:05,779
SHE SAID IT
WASN'T HIS FAULT.

679
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,148
IT WAS MY FAULT.

680
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:10,150
I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN HER OUT OF THE CAR.

681
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,620
I BOUGHT IT
FOR THE PARTY.

682
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:15,522
WE WERE
STARTING OUT

683
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:18,324
WHEN THE FIRST
PLANES CAME OVER.

684
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,927
UP EARLY, WEREN'T YOU?

685
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:22,129
RAIDER, GO AHEAD.

686
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,131
WE SPOTTED
THE PLANES AND HEARD THE BOMBS.

687
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,235
I TOLD SUSAN
TO HOP OUT AND GET UNDER COVER.

688
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:33,440
GO ON.

689
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:36,342
A TRUCK BLOCKED
THE ROAD AHEAD OF US.

690
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,080
IT WAS A DELIVERY TRUCK
FROM HONOLULU.

691
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:44,350
I THOUGHT
THE DRIVER HAD BEEN HIT.

692
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,653
THEN THERE WAS
AN EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF ME.

693
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:50,624
THERE WAS A JAP
BEHIND THE WHEEL WITH A SHOTGUN.

694
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,393
I HIT HIM
AND MOVED THE TRUCK.

695
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,430
WAS SUSAN
ALL RIGHT THEN?

696
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,632
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE MADE HER GET OUT.

697
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:04,205
SHE TOOK THE WHEEL

698
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:07,273
AND DROVE
ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARD THE HANGAR.

699
00:42:08,644 --> 00:42:11,377
HOW DID SHE
GET HURT THEN?

700
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,480
MACHINE GUN.

701
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:16,282
A SOLDIER WAS KILLED
SAVING HER.

702
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:18,085
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

703
00:42:18,086 --> 00:42:20,620
YOU'RE NOT HURT ANY.

704
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,424
NOW LISTEN,
WAIT A MINUTE!

705
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:25,292
IF I STAY HERE, I'LL...

706
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,261
YOU GUYS
DON'T THINK--

707
00:42:27,262 --> 00:42:29,629
SEE YOU.

708
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:48,015
YOU WANTED TO
SEE ME, COLONEL?

709
00:42:48,016 --> 00:42:50,618
HOW IS YOUR SISTER,
McMARTIN?

710
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:51,819
PRETTY WEAK, SIR.

711
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,755
THE SURGEON SAYS
IT'S HARD TO TELL YET.

712
00:42:55,123 --> 00:42:57,891
I'M GOING OVER
IN THE MORNING.

713
00:42:58,694 --> 00:42:59,894
I'M AFRAID NOT.

714
00:42:59,895 --> 00:43:02,996
THIS PLANE LEAVES
BEFORE DAYLIGHT FOR MANILA.

715
00:43:03,098 --> 00:43:06,333
WE'RE SAFE HERE,
BUT THE PHILIPPINES ARE IN BAD SHAPE.

716
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:10,337
WE'RE SENDING
AS MANY B-17s AS POSSIBLE.

717
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:12,340
WHERE DO WE REFUEL?

718
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,073
WAKE ISLAND.

719
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:15,910
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'LL FIND THERE.

720
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,612
YOU GOT
THE CHARTS THERE?

721
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:19,881
YES, SIR.

722
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:22,683
HOW DID THE ENGINES
REV UP, SERGEANT?

723
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,919
NUMBER-THREE ENGINE'S
A LITTLE ROUGH.

724
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,021
WE'LL OVERHAUL IT
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

725
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,358
WE'RE TAKING OFF
IN TWO HOURS.

726
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,193
YOU'LL SEE THAT SON
OF YOURS SOON.

727
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,064
MANILA? WE'LL HAVE
THAT ENGINE RUNNING  IN 90 MINUTES.

728
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,468
WE'LL MAKE IT
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

729
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,037
TAKE OFF WHENEVER
YOU'RE READY.

730
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:45,139
TELL YOUR PASSENGER
I'LL HAVE PAPERS FOR HIM.

731
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:46,341
WHAT PASSENGER?

732
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:48,243
MANILA
NEEDS A PILOT.

733
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:50,945
YOU'RE TAKING ONE
ALONG--

734
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,650
HE'S ONE
OF THREE FIGHTERS

735
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:58,453
THAT GOT
OFF THE GROUND THIS MORNING.

736
00:43:58,454 --> 00:44:01,588
KNOCKED OFF
FOUR JAPS BEFORE THEY SHOT HIM DOWN.

737
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:03,926
GOOD LUCK AGAIN.

738
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,427
THANK YOU, SIR.

739
00:44:09,332 --> 00:44:12,366
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO FELLOWS
TALKED OUT OF TURN.

740
00:44:13,336 --> 00:44:16,270
GO AND RUSTLE UP SOME GRUB
FOR THE CREW.

741
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:19,841
YES, SIR.

742
00:45:01,818 --> 00:45:02,418
JAVA, LIEUTENANT?

743
00:45:02,419 --> 00:45:05,321
NO. YOU MUST HAVE
A PLANTATION IN BRAZIL.

744
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,089
MAYBE YOU'LL
WANT SOME LATER.

745
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,458
IS THIS HERE
WAKE ISLAND?

746
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,327
YEAH.

747
00:45:11,328 --> 00:45:12,395
HOW FAR IS IT?

748
00:45:12,396 --> 00:45:14,997
IT'S ABOUT 2,300 MILES
FROM HONOLULU.

749
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:17,698
WE'RE LANDING
ON THAT DOT?

750
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,001
YEAH.

751
00:45:19,002 --> 00:45:22,036
I WISH THERE WAS
SOME TRAFFIC SIGNS AROUND,

752
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:25,341
LIKE NUMBERS
AND STREETS.

753
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:28,276
THEY CALL THEM
LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES.

754
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,579
THEY'RE JUST
LIKE SIGNS?

755
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,481
YEAH, IF THE WIND
DOESN'T CHANGE THEM.

756
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,885
LIEUTENANT,
HOW ARE WE DOING?

757
00:45:36,886 --> 00:45:39,687
YOU'RE THE FIFTH GUY
TO ASK THAT.

758
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:43,159
WE'LL HIT WAKE
ALL RIGHT.

759
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,893
YES, SIR.
I WAS JUST ASKING.

760
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:55,971
TIME TO RELIEVE THE KID,
MINNESOTA.

761
00:45:56,306 --> 00:45:58,573
O.K.

762
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,546
WANT ANYTHING,
LIEUTENANT?

763
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:06,414
I'D LIKE TO GET OUT
OF THIS BOXCAR.

764
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:10,385
MARY-ANN
AIN'T NO BOXCAR.

765
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,821
MARY-ANN?

766
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:14,689
THERE AIN'T A BETTER
AIRPLANE AROUND.

767
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:17,826
MAYBE, IF YOU
MEAN BOMBERS.

768
00:46:17,995 --> 00:46:18,761
ANY AIRPLANE.

769
00:46:18,762 --> 00:46:21,596
I'LL TAKE A
PURSUIT SHIP FOR MINE.

770
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,766
YOU CAN TAKE PURSUIT--

771
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:26,134
YES, SIR.

772
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,810
THAT'S MY LAST APPLE.

773
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:36,278
DON'T LEAVE IT
LAYING AROUND.

774
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:39,147
THERE'S A PURSUIT PILOT
BACK THERE.

775
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:56,432
HOW ARE WE DOING?

776
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:59,400
EVERY 15 MINUTES
SOMEBODY COMES DOWN HERE

777
00:47:00,037 --> 00:47:03,038
TO FIND OUT IF I'LL
GET THIS AIRPLANE LOST!

778
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:05,041
I'M GETTING SICK OF--

779
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,576
I'M SORRY, SERGEANT.

780
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:09,345
I'M A LITTLE ON EDGE.

781
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:10,547
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

782
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:13,649
THAT'S HOW YOUR
OLD MAN WOULD HAVE TOLD ME OFF.

783
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,121
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

784
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:20,189
HOW ARE
WE DOING?

785
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,991
WE'LL HIT WAKE
RIGHT ON THE NOSE.

786
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,595
SURE WE WILL, SIR.

787
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:38,907
WHAT IF THE JAPS
TAKE WAKE ISLAND

788
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,510
BEFORE WE GET THERE?

789
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:43,546
I WISH YOU'D CONTROL
THAT IMAGINATION OF YOURS.

790
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:47,084
WE'RE NOT AT WAR.

791
00:47:47,085 --> 00:47:48,552
WE'RE NOT?

792
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:49,486
IT HASN'T
BEEN DECLARED.

793
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:52,588
THEM JAPS, THEY SMEAR
PEARL HARBOR, SMACK MANILA,

794
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,459
RAID WAKE, GUAM,
AND MIDWAY,

795
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,961
AND STILL
THERE AIN'T NO WAR.

796
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,797
THEY SEND SOME GENTS
TO WASHINGTON

797
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,933
WITH AN OLIVE WREATH
FOR THE PRESIDENT.

798
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:08,537
YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL UNCLE SAM GETS MAD.

799
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:12,741
I THINK I'LL GET
SLIGHTLY ANNOYED IN THE MEANTIME.

800
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:17,379
I DIDN'T
EXPECT IT OF YOU.

801
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:20,617
[BEEP-BEEP-BEEP]

802
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:23,619
MESSAGE COMING THROUGH, SIR,
AND GOOD NEWS.

803
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,223
[BEEP-BEEP-BEEP]

804
00:48:30,328 --> 00:48:32,862
THANKS, PETERSON.

805
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:37,600
HEY, YOU GUYS,
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

806
00:48:43,374 --> 00:48:45,408
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

807
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:47,612
SHE MUST BE O.K., HUH?

808
00:48:47,613 --> 00:48:48,979
SURE, SHE IS.

809
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,148
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

810
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:51,782
ME, TOO.

811
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:54,284
BETTER SHOW IT
TO OUR PASSENGER.

812
00:48:54,285 --> 00:48:57,053
THE POOR GUY
MUST BE WORRYING.

813
00:48:57,288 --> 00:48:58,388
LET HIM WORRY.

814
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:00,457
AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE TOUGH?

815
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:03,159
I HAVEN'T
KICKED HIM YET.

816
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:05,095
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

817
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:06,530
WELL, MAYBE I AM.

818
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:09,699
PETERSON, ASK
LIEUTENANT RAIDER TO COME UP FRONT.

819
00:49:11,136 --> 00:49:13,337
LOOK, STAY OUT
OF ARGUMENTS.

820
00:49:13,338 --> 00:49:14,171
WE DIDN'T START THEM.

821
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:17,540
THE GUY HAS BEEN
SHOOTING OFF HIS FACE AGAINST BIG AIRPLANES.

822
00:49:19,578 --> 00:49:22,278
HE DOESN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER.

823
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:23,414
JUST QUIT ARGUING.

824
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:25,149
YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF.

825
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,984
O.K., CAPTAIN.

826
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:28,753
SOMEBODY
WANTED TO SEE ME?

827
00:49:28,754 --> 00:49:31,554
YEAH, WE GOT
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

828
00:49:32,924 --> 00:49:35,526
BOY, THAT IS
GOOD NEWS.

829
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:37,862
OH, SHE'S
A SWELL KID.

830
00:49:37,863 --> 00:49:40,797
TEX, WE WERE ALL
PRETTY UPSET LAST NIGHT.

831
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:45,067
IF WE SAID ANYTHING
OUT OF LINE...

832
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:47,705
OH, FORGET IT.

833
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:49,374
WE'VE HAD OUR ARGUMENTS

834
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:52,409
ABOUT THESE BIG BOMBERS
AND YOUR PEASHOOTERS.

835
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:56,045
FORGET IT. IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF OPINION.

836
00:49:57,383 --> 00:50:00,250
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
YESTERDAY AT HICKAM?

837
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,521
AN AWFUL MESS.
WE WEREN'T READY.

838
00:50:04,623 --> 00:50:07,058
HOW GOOD
ARE THOSE JAPS?

839
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:09,926
THEY'RE GOOD
WHEN THEY GOT THE EDGE.

840
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:13,563
THEY DON'T LIKE
AN EVEN FIGHT.

841
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:16,733
WE HEARD YOU DID
A SWELL JOB.

842
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:20,370
HOW COME ALL THEIR
CARRIERS GOT AWAY?

843
00:50:21,173 --> 00:50:23,974
WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET A BOMBER OFF.

844
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:27,312
IT'S NOT
THE BOMBER'S FAULT!

845
00:50:27,313 --> 00:50:30,280
YOU'RE AWFUL TOUCHY
ABOUT THESE CRATES.

846
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:33,383
HOLD IT!
GO AHEAD, MONK.

847
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:36,453
THE WIND'S SHIFTED.
YOU BETTER MAKE IT 244.

848
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:40,491
O.K., 244.

849
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:43,061
THAT'S A NEW
FLIGHT CONTROL?

850
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:45,996
YEAH,
IT'S BETTER THAN THE OLD TYPE.

851
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:49,367
WHY DON'T YOU
FLY HER?

852
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:52,236
NO, LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S FLYING HERSELF.

853
00:50:52,672 --> 00:50:54,773
SHE IS NOW,
YEAH.

854
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:56,474
SHE'S NOT FLYING FAST.

855
00:50:56,475 --> 00:50:59,409
SHE'LL OUTFLY YOUR
PURSUIT SHIPS UP HIGH.

856
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:03,013
WHAT WILL A
P-40 DO AT 30,000?

857
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:06,650
WE'D RUN AWAY
AND HIDE ON YOU.

858
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:10,287
IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE,
I'LL PROVE SOMETHING, O.K.?

859
00:51:13,092 --> 00:51:14,092
GO AHEAD.

860
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:17,027
JUST THREE MINUTES
AND NO INTERRUPTIONS.

861
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:20,130
THE NAVIGATOR
GAVE YOU A COURSE.

862
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:23,233
YOU TURN A KNOB,
YOU'RE ON IT.

863
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:26,837
THAT GADGET'S ALMOST
AS GOOD AS YOUR BOMBSIGHT.

864
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:31,008
YOU CALL THE SIGHT
"THE BRAIN."

865
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,111
THIS IS A
MECHANICAL BRAIN, TOO.

866
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:37,214
IT'S DOING
THE THINKING NOW.

867
00:51:37,216 --> 00:51:39,284
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT IT?

868
00:51:39,285 --> 00:51:42,387
THEY'LL GIVE COMMISSIONS
TO THESE MECHANICAL BRAINS

869
00:51:43,523 --> 00:51:45,357
IN THE BOMBERS.

870
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:47,692
THEY'LL TURN OUT
BOMBER PILOTS

871
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:49,828
ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE.

872
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:50,929
WE PURSUIT PILOTS

873
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,031
WILL SEE THESE MECHANIZED
FREIGHT TRAINS COMING.

874
00:51:54,634 --> 00:51:57,701
YOU TELL THAT THING,
"DROP A LOAD ON THE ENEMY."

875
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:02,873
"YES, SIR, I'LL TELL
CAPTAIN BOMBSIGHT NOW."

876
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:05,511
"WHERE'S YOUR PILOTS?"

877
00:52:05,512 --> 00:52:08,413
"ON THE GROUND.
WE DON'T NEED THEM."

878
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:10,882
VERY FUNNY.

879
00:52:10,883 --> 00:52:13,884
SERIOUSLY, THESE
BIG CRATES ARE ALL RIGHT.

880
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:17,522
I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT IN ANY AIRPLANE

881
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:21,692
THAT MORE THAN ONE MAN
CAN RIDE IN.

882
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:25,796
I DON'T WANT TO DEPEND
ON OTHER GUYS.

883
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:28,867
IN A PURSUIT SHIP,

884
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:32,003
YOU DON'T WAIT FOR ORDERS
FROM A GUY WHO CAN'T FLY

885
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:37,043
THEY CALL A BOMBARDIER.

886
00:52:37,044 --> 00:52:39,744
"WHERE TO?"
SAYS THE IRISHMAN.

887
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:42,413
YOU SAY, "GO A FEW BLOCKS,

888
00:52:42,615 --> 00:52:45,516
THROW AN EGG
OUT THE WINDOW, AND RUN."

889
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:49,620
I WOULDN'T FLY THIS
IF THEY MADE ME A BRIGADIER.

890
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:54,060
RADIO TO PILOT.

891
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:56,995
THE PRESIDENT'S
ON THE SHORT WAVE, SIR.

892
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,465
GET BELOW AND GRAB
SOME HEADPHONES.

893
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,534
TAKE THAT
PURSUIT PILOT WITH YOU.

894
00:53:04,237 --> 00:53:05,905
DO I HAVE TO?

895
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:08,740
DROP HIM OUT
IF YOU GET A CHANCE.

896
00:53:11,912 --> 00:53:15,013
[PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT]
THE ATTACK YESTERDAY

897
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:17,584
ON THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS

898
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:19,151
HAS CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE

899
00:53:19,152 --> 00:53:22,220
TO AMERICAN NAVAL
AND MILITARY FORCES.

900
00:53:23,557 --> 00:53:26,691
I REGRET TO TELL YOU
THAT MANY AMERICAN LIVES

901
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:31,163
HAVE BEEN LOST.

902
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:33,766
BUT ALWAYS
WILL OUR WHOLE NATION

903
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:37,002
REMEMBER THE CHARACTER
OF THE ONSLAUGHT AGAINST US.

904
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,509
[APPLAUSE]

905
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,111
I HOPE HE SAYS
SOMETHING

906
00:53:45,112 --> 00:53:46,812
ABOUT
THE PHILIPPINES.

907
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:49,015
MY BOY'S
AT CLARK FIELD.

908
00:53:49,016 --> 00:53:51,950
NO MATTER HOW LONG
IT MAY TAKE US

909
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,154
TO OVERCOME THIS
PREMEDITATED INVASION,

910
00:53:57,858 --> 00:54:01,026
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS MIGHT,

911
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:04,596
WILL WIN THROUGH
TO ABSOLUTE VICTORY.

912
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,467
[APPLAUSE]

913
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:13,540
WE WILL NOT ONLY

914
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,242
DEFEND OURSELVES
TO THE UTTERMOST,

915
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:19,110
BUT WILL MAKE IT
VERY CERTAIN

916
00:54:20,414 --> 00:54:23,282
THAT THIS
FORM OF TREACHERY

917
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:26,385
SHALL NEVER AGAIN
ENDANGER US.

918
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:29,488
WITH CONFIDENCE
IN OUR ARMED FORCES,

919
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:33,892
WITH THE UNBOUNDING
DETERMINATION OF OUR PEOPLE,

920
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,331
WE WILL GAIN
THE INEVITABLE TRIUMPH,

921
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:43,670
SO HELP US GOD.

922
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:46,572
I ASK THAT
THE CONGRESS DECLARE

923
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:51,310
A STATE OF WAR.

924
00:54:51,879 --> 00:54:54,313
[APPLAUSE]

925
00:55:37,058 --> 00:55:39,925
PICK UP ANYTHING
FROM WAKE ISLAND?

926
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:53,407
PILOT
TO NAVIGATOR.

927
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:55,809
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, MONK?

928
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,811
GO ANOTHER 10 MINUTES
AND THEN TURN EAST.

929
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,282
O.K.

930
00:56:30,945 --> 00:56:32,780
THERE SHE IS,
DEAD AHEAD.

931
00:56:32,781 --> 00:56:34,481
GOOD GUESSING,
MONK.

932
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:36,184
AW, SHUT UP.

933
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,351
MAGELLAN!

934
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,187
PILOT TO CREW,
WAKE ISLAND AHEAD.

935
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,723
HEY, WAKE ISLAND
IN SIGHT!

936
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:45,292
BOY, WHAT A NAVIGATOR!

937
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,028
THERE'S NOTHING HERE
BUT MARINES.

938
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:56,531
WHERE DID YOU
GUYS COME FROM?

939
00:57:56,532 --> 00:57:57,899
HICKAM FIELD.

940
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,701
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?

941
00:57:59,702 --> 00:58:00,968
MANILA.

942
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:03,570
GANGWAY, MEN, COMING IN.

943
00:58:05,407 --> 00:58:08,208
I'M MAJOR DANIELS,
COMMANDING.

944
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:08,843
QUINCANNON.

945
00:58:08,844 --> 00:58:11,912
MEET LIEUTENANTS WILLIAMS,
McMARTIN, AND RAIDER.

946
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,516
THIS IS LIEUTENANT HAUSER,
OUR NAVIGATOR.

947
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:17,551
GOT TO PUT HIM
IN A GLASS CASE IN A MUSEUM.

948
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:19,287
GOOD JOB,
HAUSER.

949
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,922
THE ISLAND
LOOKED GOOD TO ME.

950
00:58:20,923 --> 00:58:21,390
ME, TOO!

951
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:24,458
IT LOOKS BETTER
THAN ANY TIME SINCE MONDAY.

952
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,593
YOU MEAN
SUNDAY, SIR.

953
00:58:25,594 --> 00:58:28,862
[MAJOR DANIELS]
YOU'VE CROSSED  THE DATE LINE.

954
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:30,332
HE'S A PURSUIT PILOT.

955
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:32,467
THEY DON'T
GET AROUND VERY MUCH.

956
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:35,336
COULD WE BUNK DOWN
FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS?

957
00:58:35,871 --> 00:58:38,506
IN 6 HOURS, YOU'LL
BE 5 1/2 HOURS OUT OF HERE.

958
00:58:38,507 --> 00:58:41,042
WITH OUR BEACONS,
THE JAPS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT!

959
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:44,077
MY ORDERS
ARE TO GET YOU OUT IN 20 MINUTES.

960
00:58:44,213 --> 00:58:45,213
20 MINUTES?

961
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:46,981
THAT'S RIGHT.

962
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,817
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
SERGEANT?

963
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:50,718
WE'RE HALFWAY
TO MANILA NOW.

964
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:53,554
WE'LL MAKE IT
THE REST OF THE WAY.

965
00:58:53,923 --> 00:58:55,357
I COULD USE
SOME HELP.

966
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:57,359
TAKE ALL THE MEN
YOU NEED.

967
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,428
YOU FIVE MEN
COME WITH ME,

968
00:58:59,429 --> 00:59:01,330
I WANT THE COWLING
OFF THE ENGINE.

969
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:04,032
OUR AIR FORCE COMMANDER,
MAJOR BAGLEY,

970
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:05,300
WANTS TO SEE YOU.

971
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:07,668
YES, SIR.

972
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:17,079
THEY GOT
THE ARIZONA?

973
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,214
YES, HICKAM FIELD
WAS HIT AS BAD AS PEARL HARBOR.

974
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:23,485
WE GOT PRACTICALLY
NOTHING OFF THE GROUND.

975
00:59:23,486 --> 00:59:26,421
I'VE STUDIED ALL THE WARS
OF HISTORY, GENTLEMEN.

976
00:59:26,422 --> 00:59:29,556
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS
ANY DIRTY TREACHERY LIKE THAT.

977
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,760
HOW MANY AIRPLANES
HAVE YOU GOT?

978
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:34,062
A WEEK AGO,
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

979
00:59:34,063 --> 00:59:37,064
A FEW DAYS AGO,
THEY FLEW IN 12 FIGHTERS.

980
00:59:37,566 --> 00:59:38,300
EIGHT WERE DESTROYED

981
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:40,135
ON THE GROUND
FOLLOWING PATROL.

982
00:59:40,136 --> 00:59:41,669
ONLY FOUR LEFT?

983
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:42,570
ONLY TWO.

984
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:44,707
ONE OF THOSE CAN'T FLY.

985
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,675
THOSE FOUR GRUMMANS
TOOK ON 60 NIPS TODAY.

986
00:59:49,112 --> 00:59:50,479
SHOT DOWN PLENTY.

987
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,280
HOGAN AND INGERSOLL
GOT THEIRS.

988
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,985
I THINK YOU KNEW THEM.

989
00:59:55,986 --> 00:59:57,152
YEAH. YEAH.
YEAH.

990
00:59:57,153 --> 00:59:59,954
I SUPPOSE THE JAPS
WILL BE BACK.

991
01:00:00,123 --> 01:00:02,224
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

992
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:03,726
WE GOT A LAD

993
01:00:03,727 --> 01:00:06,661
WHO WILL TAKE THEM ALL ON
SINGLE-HANDED!

994
01:00:07,163 --> 01:00:08,564
LIEUTENANT ROSE.

995
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:09,865
BUDDY ROSE?

996
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:11,133
YOU GUYS
REMEMBER ROSE.

997
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:13,201
EVERYBODY KIDDED HIM
ABOUT HIS SIZE,

998
01:00:13,202 --> 01:00:16,038
A LITTLE BITTY SQUIRT
ABOUT THAT HIGH.

999
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:16,872
WE KNEW HIM.

1000
01:00:16,873 --> 01:00:18,373
I'D LIKE TO SALUTE HIM.

1001
01:00:18,374 --> 01:00:20,009
COULD WE TALK TO HIM?

1002
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,943
HE NEEDS REST.

1003
01:00:20,944 --> 01:00:23,879
WE MAY HAVE TO
ROUST HIM OUT ANY MINUTE.

1004
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,948
AND HE HASN'T HAD
MUCH OF A CHANCE TO SLEEP.

1005
01:00:27,484 --> 01:00:29,919
SHIP'S READY, SIR.

1006
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,153
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.

1007
01:00:31,154 --> 01:00:32,321
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

1008
01:00:32,322 --> 01:00:34,122
GO OUT AND BLAST THE JAPS.

1009
01:00:34,123 --> 01:00:35,991
TEACH THEM
THAT TREACHERY CAN'T WIN,

1010
01:00:35,992 --> 01:00:38,960
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
OF A HEAD START IT HAS.

1011
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:40,996
YOU YOUNG FELLOWS
WILL DO THAT.

1012
01:00:40,997 --> 01:00:43,966
WE'RE ONLY FIGHTING
A DELAYING ACTION HERE.

1013
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:45,200
YOU CAN'T HOLD OUT?

1014
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:48,002
MY 400 MARINES
ARE FIGHTING MAD.

1015
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:50,905
SOME JAP TAIL FEATHERS
WILL BE FLYING.

1016
01:00:51,408 --> 01:00:54,276
MAJOR BAGLEY,
CAN'T WE FLY YOU OUT?

1017
01:00:54,611 --> 01:00:57,412
YOU AND THE REST
OF THE WOUNDED?

1018
01:00:57,414 --> 01:00:58,881
NO, I'M NOT WORTH

1019
01:00:58,882 --> 01:01:00,416
MY WEIGHT IN GASOLINE.

1020
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,684
ME OR ANYBODY ELSE.

1021
01:01:01,685 --> 01:01:04,187
THEY NEED YOUR SHIP
IN MANILA.

1022
01:01:04,188 --> 01:01:05,555
GET IT THERE.

1023
01:01:05,556 --> 01:01:06,222
YES, SIR.

1024
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:08,058
IF YOU SEE
GENERAL MacARTHUR,

1025
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:10,959
TELL HIM NO MATTER WHAT
THE NEWS IS...

1026
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,262
WE'LL BE PITCHING
TILL THEY STRIKE US OUT.

1027
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:15,965
YES, SIR, WE WILL.

1028
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,500
I'LL SEE YOU ALL.

1029
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:19,069
SEE YOU, MAJOR.

1030
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,470
GOOD LUCK.

1031
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:30,513
SHOULD WE
TAKE HIM WITH US?

1032
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:33,482
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE
THIS ISLAND OF PARADISE,

1033
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,986
NO MATTER WHAT.

1034
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:37,854
HERE'S ONE
FOR THE WIFE.

1035
01:01:37,855 --> 01:01:39,788
AND ONE
FOR THE KID.

1036
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:41,524
DON'T LOSE THEM,
SOLDIER.

1037
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:42,358
DON'T WORRY.

1038
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:45,460
I WANTED TO LEAVE
A LETTER FOR  THE CLIPPER.

1039
01:01:45,863 --> 01:01:46,997
SHE GOT AWAY
YESTERDAY.

1040
01:01:46,998 --> 01:01:49,965
THE CREW WANTED
TO STAY HERE AND FIGHT.

1041
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,535
TAKE CARE
OF THIS ONE.

1042
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:52,936
O.K.

1043
01:01:52,937 --> 01:01:55,505
WE DON'T WANT
TRIPOLI TO GET HURT.

1044
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:58,008
HE AIN'T NO PEDIGREE,
BUT HE CAN FIGHT.

1045
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:00,710
HE'D TACKLE A JAP
THREE TIMES HIS SIZE.

1046
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:03,046
I WISH I COULD,
BUT I CAN'T.

1047
01:02:03,047 --> 01:02:05,782
JUST GIVE HIM TO
THE MARINES IN MANILA.

1048
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:06,182
BUT...

1049
01:02:06,183 --> 01:02:09,151
COME ON.
YOU GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

1050
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:10,253
IT'S AGAINST
REGULATIONS, PAL.

1051
01:02:10,254 --> 01:02:12,789
I CAN'T TAKE
THAT DOG ALONG.

1052
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,557
YOU COULD
GET ME BUSTED.

1053
01:02:13,558 --> 01:02:16,491
HE'S TRAINED, TOO.
DO YOU LIKE MR. MOTO?

1054
01:02:17,094 --> 01:02:19,228
[ARF ARF]

1055
01:02:19,229 --> 01:02:21,330
AIN'T THAT CUTE,
WINOCKI?

1056
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:22,966
HE'S SMART,
ALL RIGHT.

1057
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:23,733
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1058
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:26,536
GEE, I'D LIKE TO,
HONEST, BUT...

1059
01:02:26,737 --> 01:02:29,539
AW, GEE, HERE GOES
MY PROMOTION.

1060
01:02:30,374 --> 01:02:31,841
THAT'S A GOOD FELLA.

1061
01:02:31,842 --> 01:02:34,477
DUCK.
HERE THEY COME.

1062
01:02:36,914 --> 01:02:37,747
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

1063
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:40,650
ANYTHING WE CAN
DO FOR YOU IN MANILA?

1064
01:02:40,985 --> 01:02:43,719
YOU MIGHT SEND US
MORE JAPS.

1065
01:02:44,254 --> 01:02:46,722
GOOD LUCK, MEN.

1066
01:03:17,122 --> 01:03:18,555
CAN'T YOU SLEEP?

1067
01:03:18,556 --> 01:03:21,591
NO, I KEEP THINKING
OF THOSE MARINES ON WAKE.

1068
01:03:23,294 --> 01:03:26,096
THEY HAVEN'T

01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:12,960
HIS NAME IS TRIPOLI.

1244
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,695
FEED HIM GOOD.

1245
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:16,430
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1246
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:18,931
CALLAHAN. THANKS!

1247
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:25,139
YOU ALL READY
UP THERE?

1248
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,574
ALL READY.

1249
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:27,608
LET HER GO!

1250
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,676
WATCH IT.

1251
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,478
STEADY.

1252
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:31,846
KEEP HER LEVEL.

1253
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,581
NOW TURN HER,
FELLOWS.

1254
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,949
TURN HER.

1255
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,453
MAKE IT SNAPPY.

1256
01:12:43,725 --> 01:12:46,193
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

1257
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,569
TAKE STRAIN ON.

1258
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,004
TAKE IT AWAY.

1259
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:06,514
THAT'S THE SITUATION,
AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW.

1260
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,549
THE FACT IS, WE'VE
TAKEN AN AWFUL LICKING

1261
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,052
BECAUSE WE WERE
CAUGHT ON THE GROUND.

1262
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:13,454
THEY'VE OUTNUMBERED US
TEN TO ONE.

1263
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,190
YET, EVERY TIME WE'VE BEEN
UP AGAINST THEM,

1264
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:17,992
THEY'VE LOST FIVE
TO OUR ONE.

1265
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,961
IF WE WERE NEAR EQUAL,
WE COULD LICK THEM.

1266
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,799
WE'LL KEEP FIGHTING
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT.

1267
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,401
TILL WE CAN GET
ENOUGH AIRPLANES

1268
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,936
TO BLAST THEM
OFF THE EARTH.

1269
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:29,971
HOW LONG SINCE
YOU'VE SLEPT, CAPTAIN?

1270
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,173
WE HAVEN'T HAD
MUCH TIME FOR THAT.

1271
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,643
THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS
CONTINUOUS FLYING.

1272
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,678
YOU'VE DONE
A GOOD JOB.

1273
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:37,913
I'VE GOT
A GOOD CREW.

1274
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,481
I BELIEVE IT.

1275
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:40,248
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1276
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,149
WHAT DID YOU
FIND, MORAN?

1277
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,951
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN INVASION FLEET.

1278
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,019
WHAT'S IN IT?

1279
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,988
THEY'VE GOT
SOME DESTROYERS WITH THEM.

1280
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:49,625
WHERE?

1281
01:13:49,626 --> 01:13:51,627
THEY'RE
ABOUT 40 MILES OFF LINGAYEN.

1282
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:54,095
I DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH TIME TO WAIT.

1283
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,765
THE SKY SUDDENLY
GOT FULL OF ZEROS.

1284
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,099
SO I HEADED
FOR HOME.

1285
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,601
HERE'S THE POSITION
AND COURSE.

1286
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,470
A FLIGHT OF B-17s
COULD WORK, SIR.

1287
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,539
WE HAVEN'T GOT
A FLIGHT OF B-17s.

1288
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,176
WE'VE GOT ONE B-17
LOADING UP NOW.

1289
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:09,445
YES, SIR.
WANT TO TACKLE IT?

1290
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:12,113
STUDY THIS FIRST,
DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.

1291
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,650
MORAN WILL GIVE YOU
ALL THE DOPE.

1292
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:16,318
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
ONE THING MORE.

1293
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,420
I TOLD OUR CREW CHIEF
I'D FIND OUT ABOUT HIS SON,

1294
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:22,391
DANNY WHITE.

1295
01:14:22,392 --> 01:14:24,193
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?

1296
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:26,462
HE WAS KILLED
THE FIRST DAY.

1297
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:27,829
THAT'S A SHAME.

1298
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,165
GIVE THESE TO ROBBIE.

1299
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:31,966
I'VE KNOWN HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

1300
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:33,435
HOW DID IT
HAPPEN, SIR?

1301
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:36,471
CAPTAIN ANDERSON CAN
TELL YOU MORE THAN I CAN.

1302
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,541
HE SAW THE WHOLE THING.

1303
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,943
YES, SIR.

1304
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:03,597
FIND OUT
ANYTHING, SIR?

1305
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:19,248
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

1306
01:15:19,249 --> 01:15:21,350
HE WAS TRYING
TO TAKE OFF.

1307
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:24,220
BEFORE HE COULD GET
HIS WHEELS OFF THE GROUND,

1308
01:15:24,221 --> 01:15:27,422
THEY HIT THE RUNWAY
IN FRONT OF HIM WITH A BIG ONE.

1309
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,960
DIDN'T EVEN
GET INTO THE AIR.

1310
01:15:38,502 --> 01:15:41,369
IT'S NOT MUCH
TO SHOW FOR 20 YEARS,

1311
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:44,874
IS IT, SIR?

1312
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:47,408
[AIR RAID SIREN]

1313
01:15:57,187 --> 01:15:58,320
GET THAT AIRPLANE UP!

1314
01:15:58,321 --> 01:16:00,757
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT,
LET'S GO.

1315
01:16:00,758 --> 01:16:03,124
YES, SIR.

1316
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:04,461
CLOSE THE BOMB BAY.

1317
01:16:04,462 --> 01:16:05,695
HOW MANY LOADED?

1318
01:16:05,696 --> 01:16:07,297
THREE, SIR.
ALL BIG ONES.

1319
01:16:07,298 --> 01:16:09,098
YES.
THOUSAND POUNDERS?

1320
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:11,433
GOOD.

1321
01:16:23,447 --> 01:16:26,248
LET'S GET THIS THING
OUT OF HERE!

1322
01:16:33,056 --> 01:16:35,491
TAKE IT AWAY.

1323
01:16:47,972 --> 01:16:49,306
DOORS ARE CLOSED.

1324
01:16:49,307 --> 01:16:51,906
EVERYTHING ALL SET, SIR.

1325
01:17:52,504 --> 01:17:54,871
WHEELS UP.

1326
01:17:55,073 --> 01:17:55,739
WHEELS UP.

1327
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,908
MONK, WHAT DO
YOU MAKE IT?

1328
01:17:57,909 --> 01:17:59,577
331, IRISH.

1329
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:01,944
O.K., 331.

1330
01:18:09,654 --> 01:18:12,189
BETTER PUT ON
YOUR CHUTE, ROBBIE.

1331
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:14,557
YES, SIR.

1332
01:18:43,488 --> 01:18:44,722
NAVIGATOR TO PILOT.

1333
01:18:44,723 --> 01:18:47,324
WE'RE ABOUT 30 MILES
OFF THE COAST.

1334
01:18:47,325 --> 01:18:49,760
BETTER GET OFF,
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

1335
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:52,295
O.K., GOING DOWN.

1336
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:23,726
FIGHTERS!

1337
01:19:25,397 --> 01:19:26,164
PILOT TO CREW,

1338
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:28,967
THERE'S A FLOCK
OF ZEROS AHEAD AT 2:00.

1339
01:19:28,968 --> 01:19:31,668
ABOUT 3,000 FEET
ABOVE US.

1340
01:19:34,339 --> 01:19:36,240
THERE'S ANOTHER
BUNCH AT 10:00!

1341
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:37,441
TAKE YOUR TIME.

1342
01:19:37,442 --> 01:19:40,243
SING OUT IF THEY
GET ON HER TAIL.

1343
01:19:40,578 --> 01:19:41,612
MAKE IT COUNT.

1344
01:19:41,613 --> 01:19:44,414
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO GET EVEN FOR.

1345
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,257
HERE THEY COME!

1346
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:06,269
COMING OVER!

1347
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,788
THEY BREAK UP
IN PIECES!

1348
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:36,300
WINOCKI,
ONE AT 9:00 COMING DOWN.

1349
01:20:40,072 --> 01:20:42,506
COMING OVER!

1350
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:56,120
GREAT!

1351
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:11,435
TAKE IT LEFT!

1352
01:21:12,171 --> 01:21:14,471
RIGHT!

1353
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:24,982
HEY, JOE,
FRIED JAP GOING DOWN!

1354
01:21:36,729 --> 01:21:38,563
GAS LINE ON TWO.

1355
01:21:38,564 --> 01:21:41,065
GAS LINE ON TWO.

1356
01:21:46,472 --> 01:21:48,073
OIL LINE'S BURNING.

1357
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:50,674
WE'LL HAVE TO BAIL OUT.

1358
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,277
PILOT TO CREW--

1359
01:21:52,278 --> 01:21:54,379
[MACHINE GUN FIRE]

1360
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,580
YOU HURT, IRISH?

1361
01:21:55,581 --> 01:21:58,482
YEAH.
PILOT TO CREW, ABANDON SHIP.

1362
01:22:01,387 --> 01:22:03,822

1363
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:08,326
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

1364
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,101
TOMMY, GET RID
OF YOUR SITE.

1365
01:22:16,102 --> 01:22:18,771
YOU AND MONK
GO OUT THE BOMB BAY.

1366
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:20,405
I'LL USE
THE ESCAPE HATCH.

1367
01:22:20,406 --> 01:22:22,908
THEY'LL HAVE TO DRAG
THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN

1368
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:23,742
TO GET THIS.

1369
01:22:23,743 --> 01:22:25,077
OPEN THE ESCAPE HATCH,

1370
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:27,579
I'LL THROW IT OUT.

1371
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:35,455

1372
01:22:35,456 --> 01:22:37,822
GET OUT!

1373
01:22:41,995 --> 01:22:44,963
YOU'RE 20 MILES
NORTHWEST OF THE FIELD.

1374
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:45,831
GET OUT!

1375
01:22:45,832 --> 01:22:48,467
GO AHEAD,

1377
01:22:51,472 --> 01:22:53,339
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

1378
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,974
GO ON.
ALL RIGHT, KID.

1379
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:09,288

1380
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:11,157
GO AHEAD.
I'M COMING.

1381
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:13,458
O.K.

1382
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:53,266
05564 TO CLARK FIELD.

1383
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:55,801

THERE, SIR!
ONE ENGINE'S BURNING!

1385
01:23:58,372 --> 01:23:59,672
GET YOUR WHEELS DOWN!

1386
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:01,708
CAN'T DO IT,
GEAR'S JAMMED.

1387
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:04,276
IT WON'T COME DOWN!

1388
01:24:48,055 --> 01:24:48,855
WELL.

1389
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:51,591
I JUST LOOKED
AT THAT B-17.

1390
01:24:51,593 --> 01:24:53,427
COUNTED OVER
100 BULLET HOLES.

1391
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:55,929
TWO MOTORS HIT,
PROPS ARE BENT,

1392
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,565
CONTROLS IN A MESS,
WHEELS DAMAGED,

1393
01:24:58,566 --> 01:25:00,267

ARE PUNCTURED,

1394
01:25:00,268 --> 01:25:01,101
ONE WING TIP GONE.

1395
01:25:01,102 --> 01:25:04,270
I DON'T SEE HOW
SHE WAS BROUGHT DOWN IN ONE PIECE.

1396
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,707
IF WE HAD 10 DAYS

1397
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,209
AND PLENTY
OF SPARE PARTS,

1398
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,044
WE MIGHT MAKE HER
FLY AGAIN.

1399
01:25:11,045 --> 01:25:13,647
I DON'T KNOW THAT
WE'LL HAVE 24 HOURS.

1400
01:25:13,648 --> 01:25:15,749
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL
WRITE HER OFF.

1401
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:16,983
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL DESTROY HER.

1402
01:25:16,984 --> 01:25:19,653
NO FIRES TONIGHT,
THEY'LL HIT US AGAIN.

1403
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:21,955
JOE, SEND OUT
A DEMOLITION SQUAD

1404
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:23,490
IN THE MORNING.

1405
01:25:23,491 --> 01:25:24,358
SO LONG.

1406
01:25:24,359 --> 01:25:25,092
WHAT ABOUT THE CREW?

1407
01:25:25,093 --> 01:25:27,727
THE CREW GOT BACK
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

1408
01:25:27,728 --> 01:25:29,229
THEY'RE OVER
AT THE HOSPITAL.

1409
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:31,365
QUINCANNON ASKED
TO SEE THEM.

1410
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:33,732
HOW'S HE?

1411
01:25:34,002 --> 01:25:36,170
THAT'S TOO BAD.

1412
01:25:36,171 --> 01:25:38,471
YEAH.

1413
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:10,269
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1414
01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:13,239
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT RIFLE, TEX?

1415
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,845
I PICKED UP TOO MANY SLUGS.

1416
01:26:17,846 --> 01:26:19,947
I'M A FOOT SOLDIER NOW.

1417
01:26:19,948 --> 01:26:22,616
THEY FINALLY
GOT HIM WHERE HE BELONGS.

1418
01:26:22,617 --> 01:26:23,450
THEY WERE AFRAID

1419
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:26,452
HE WOULDN'T
LEAVE ANY JAPS TO SURRENDER.

1420
01:26:29,858 --> 01:26:30,557
WINOCKI.

1421
01:26:30,558 --> 01:26:33,326
THEY SAID
YOU BROUGHT HER IN.

1422
01:26:33,428 --> 01:26:34,294
HE DID, SIR.

1423
01:26:34,295 --> 01:26:35,796
SHE CAME IN
HERSELF.

1424
01:26:35,797 --> 01:26:37,832
I JUST
SAT THERE.

1425
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:40,234
IT WAS A GOOD JOB.

1426
01:26:40,235 --> 01:26:42,836
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
HUH?

1427
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:44,672
SHE'S...

1428
01:26:44,673 --> 01:26:47,373
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T SHE?

1429
01:26:50,546 --> 01:26:51,479
ROBBIE.

1430
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,980
YES, SIR?

1431
01:26:52,981 --> 01:26:54,982
SHE'LL FLY AGAIN?

1432
01:26:54,983 --> 01:26:56,016
SURE.

1433
01:26:56,017 --> 01:26:58,785
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER, ROBBIE?

1434
01:26:59,221 --> 01:27:02,021
OH, UH...PROPS,
GEAR, WING TIP.

1435
01:27:04,326 --> 01:27:04,959
JUST A TIP?

1436
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,728
WHAT'S A WING TIP?
A FEW DAYS.

1437
01:27:07,863 --> 01:27:09,330
TWO DAYS?

1438
01:27:09,331 --> 01:27:10,565
YES, SIR.

1439
01:27:10,566 --> 01:27:13,233
BUT SHE
WILL FLY AGAIN.

1440
01:27:13,636 --> 01:27:15,202
YEAH.

1441
01:27:15,203 --> 01:27:16,371
THAT'S FINE.

1442
01:27:16,372 --> 01:27:19,105
GET AS MANY MEN
AS YOU NEED.

1443
01:27:19,775 --> 01:27:22,609
THE COLONEL WILL
GIVE THEM TO YOU.

1444
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:26,112
I'LL GET CLEARANCE,
WE'LL LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

1445
01:27:26,548 --> 01:27:28,650
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY.

1446
01:27:28,651 --> 01:27:29,451
NURSE!

1447
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:31,953
EASY.
EASY, IRISH.

1448
01:27:31,954 --> 01:27:33,321
GET THE DOCTOR.

1449
01:27:33,322 --> 01:27:35,956
NO, THE DOCTOR CAN'T GO.

1450
01:27:37,058 --> 01:27:39,460
REGULATIONS.

1451
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:44,331
BESIDES, WE ALREADY GOT
ONE PASSENGER.

1452
01:27:46,635 --> 01:27:49,436
IS HE HERE,
THAT PURSUIT PILOT?

1453
01:27:51,073 --> 01:27:52,840
HERE, SIR.

1454
01:27:52,841 --> 01:27:55,442
O.K., START THEM, BILL.

1455
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:01,149
SURE, IRISH.

1456
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:03,684
EVERYBODY IN, CHIEF?

1457
01:28:04,353 --> 01:28:05,820
ALL IN, SIR.

1458
01:28:05,821 --> 01:28:07,422
DOORS CLOSED?

1459
01:28:07,423 --> 01:28:08,924
YES, SIR.

1460
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:11,325
HERE WE GO.

1461
01:28:15,064 --> 01:28:16,097
LOCK THEM.

1462
01:28:16,098 --> 01:28:17,699
LOCKED.

1463
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,100
WHEELS UP.

1464
01:28:20,636 --> 01:28:21,937
COMING UP.

1465
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:24,939
SOUND LIKE THEY'RE RUNNING
ALL RIGHT, ROBBIE?

1466
01:28:25,775 --> 01:28:27,209
YES, SIR.

1467
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,844
PILOT TO NAVIGATOR.

1468
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,679
GO AHEAD.

1469
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,412
MONK...

1470
01:28:31,413 --> 01:28:33,348
MONK, WHAT'S OUR COURSE?

1471
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:35,317
DUE EAST, SKIPPER.

1472
01:28:35,318 --> 01:28:36,117
THAT'S...

1473
01:28:36,118 --> 01:28:38,886
THAT'S RIGHT
INTO THE SUNRISE.

1474
01:28:39,656 --> 01:28:41,389
RIGHT INTO THE...

1475
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,958
THE SUNRISE.

1476
01:28:42,959 --> 01:28:45,459
OVER HERE, MAJOR.

1477
01:28:53,469 --> 01:28:55,970
THAT'S ALL, BOYS.

1478
01:29:01,077 --> 01:29:03,846
WELL, LET'S
GET GOING, FELLOWS.

1479
01:29:03,847 --> 01:29:06,380
WE GOT A LOT TO DO.

1480
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:20,529
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CORPORAL?

1481
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,330
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

1482
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:24,265
ME AND THE SQUAD THINKERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

1483
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:25,233
WHAT?

1484
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:28,270
WE WAS DETAILED TO BURN
THEM BUSTED AIRPLANES.

1485
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:29,605
DID YOU BURN THEM?

1486
01:29:29,606 --> 01:29:32,007
THEM JAPS ARE STEALING
THEM, SIR.

1487
01:29:32,008 --> 01:29:34,109
DON'T TALK NONSENSE.
THOSE ARE SNIPERS.

1488
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,878
THEY'RE NOT STEALING
AIRPLANES.

1489
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:38,314
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

1490
01:29:38,315 --> 01:29:39,081
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT.

1491
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:41,883
YOU HAD TO DEMOLISH
FIVE B-17s.

1492
01:29:42,552 --> 01:29:43,485
YES, SIR.

1493
01:29:43,486 --> 01:29:44,453
WHAT IS IT?

1494
01:29:44,454 --> 01:29:45,487
THEY'RE MISSING.

1495
01:29:45,488 --> 01:29:47,556
PARTS OF THEM?

1496
01:29:47,557 --> 01:29:48,757
YES, SIR.

1497
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:50,426
THERE'S A WRECKED B-17.

1498
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:52,828
THE ONE THEY CALL
THE MARY-ANN.

1499
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:54,496
HAVE YOU BURNED IT?

1500
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:55,531
NO, SIR.

1501
01:29:55,532 --> 01:29:56,165
WHY NOT?

1502
01:29:56,166 --> 01:29:58,234
I WANTED TO
MAKE A REPORT.

1503
01:29:58,235 --> 01:29:59,868
WELL, NOW,
GO BURN IT.

1504
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:02,237
YES, SIR.

1505
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,643
WHAT WAS HE
TALKING ABOUT?

1506
01:30:07,644 --> 01:30:09,845
I DON'T KNOW.
I BETTER LOOK.

1507
01:30:09,846 --> 01:30:12,380
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

1508
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,391
THERE'S WHAT
WE'RE MISSING.

1509
01:30:22,392 --> 01:30:23,993
HOW'S IT COMING,
CHIEF?

1510
01:30:23,994 --> 01:30:25,061
ALL RIGHT.

1511
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:27,063
ALL RIGHT, WEINBERG, LOWER AWAY.

1512
01:30:27,064 --> 01:30:29,898
HEY, SARGE,
ARE THE GUNS LOADED?

1513
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:30,934
SURE THEY ARE.

1514
01:30:30,935 --> 01:30:32,368
ANY BOMBS IN?

1515
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:33,202
NO.

1516
01:30:33,203 --> 01:30:34,070
GET DOWN.

1517
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:35,204
GET AWAY
FROM ME.

1518
01:30:35,205 --> 01:30:37,006
WE'RE GOING TO
BURN THIS.

1519
01:30:37,007 --> 01:30:39,942
YOU GUYS
GET THE LIVE AMMUNITION OUT.

1520
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:42,178
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

1521
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:44,714
YOU'RE BURNING
THIS PLANE?

1522
01:30:44,715 --> 01:30:46,315
THE COLONEL SAID
TO BURN IT.

1523
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:47,684
GET YOUR STUFF
OUT.

1524
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:50,352
BOYS, BRING IN
THE GAS.

1525
01:30:50,354 --> 01:30:52,955
GET THIS GASOLINE AWAY.

1526
01:30:53,423 --> 01:30:54,991
HEY, BUTCH!

1527
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,092
WEINBERG!

1528
01:30:56,093 --> 01:30:58,861
I THOUGHT YOU
WAS IN JERSEY.

1529
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:00,529
I WISHED I WAS.

1530
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,365
DON'T BURN IT.

1531
01:31:02,366 --> 01:31:03,933
I GOT ORDERS.

1532
01:31:03,934 --> 01:31:05,034
WEINBERG...

1533
01:31:05,035 --> 01:31:07,870
GET HIM AWAY
BEFORE HE GETS HURT.

1534
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,874
ORDERS IS ORDERS.

1535
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:12,041
FROM WHO?

1536
01:31:12,042 --> 01:31:13,342
THE C.O.

1537
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:15,612
TELL THE C.O. TO...

1538
01:31:15,613 --> 01:31:17,714
LOOK AT THIS AIRPLANE.

1539
01:31:17,715 --> 01:31:19,683
I'M LOOKING AT IT.

1540
01:31:19,684 --> 01:31:22,618
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BURN THIS AIRPLANE.

1541
01:31:22,653 --> 01:31:24,187
SHE'LL BE
AS GOOD AS NEW.

1542
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:24,754
BETTER, SIR.

1543
01:31:24,755 --> 01:31:27,557
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
ON HER ALL NIGHT.

1544
01:31:27,558 --> 01:31:30,393
WE'LL HAVE HER
FLYING IN 24 HOURS.

1545
01:31:31,294 --> 01:31:34,095
OUR JOB IS TO
DESTROY EVERYTHING

1546
01:31:34,264 --> 01:31:37,098
THAT WILL BE USEFUL
TO THOSE JAPS.

1547
01:31:37,968 --> 01:31:40,602
WE CAN'T
MOVE ANY GAS.

1548
01:31:40,638 --> 01:31:42,005
GET SOME DRUMS.

1549
01:31:42,006 --> 01:31:44,873
YOU CAN'T
GET THAT READY IN TIME.

1550
01:31:45,075 --> 01:31:46,643
BOMBSIGHT STILL
IN THIS AIRPLANE?

1551
01:31:46,644 --> 01:31:49,012
YES, SIR.
THE ONE WE BORROWED.

1552
01:31:49,013 --> 01:31:50,780
WE WON'T LET THEM
TAKE IT.

1553
01:31:50,781 --> 01:31:51,448
GIVE US
A CHANCE.

1554
01:31:51,449 --> 01:31:54,184
I'VE BEEN IN
THE ARMY OVER 20 YEARS.

1555
01:31:54,185 --> 01:31:55,785
THIS IS
MY FIRST FAVOR.

1556
01:31:55,786 --> 01:31:58,854
WE'LL BURN HER
OURSELVES IF WE CAN'T MAKE IT.

1557
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:00,224
YOU'RE CRAZY.

1558
01:32:00,225 --> 01:32:03,192
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF THE JAPS COME?

1559
01:32:03,827 --> 01:32:04,728
YES, SIR.

1560
01:32:04,729 --> 01:32:05,762
YOU'LL BURN IT?

1561
01:32:05,763 --> 01:32:07,097
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.

1562
01:32:07,098 --> 01:32:09,299
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

1563
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,501
FORGET IT, CORPORAL.

1564
01:32:11,502 --> 01:32:13,737
THANK YOU, SIR.

1565
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:16,672
THAT OBSERVATION
PLANE IS READY TO GO.

1566
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:19,309
WE'LL NEED
A GUNNER.

1567
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:22,144
I'LL NEED A GUNNER
FOR A FEW HOURS.

1568
01:32:23,514 --> 01:32:24,949
I CAN GO.

1569
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,316
WAIT A MINUTE.

1570
01:32:26,317 --> 01:32:28,485
I'D RATHER GO, SIR.

1571
01:32:28,486 --> 01:32:30,020
GO AHEAD.

1572
01:32:30,021 --> 01:32:31,188
YES, SIR.

1573
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:33,423
THAT KID'S
AWFULLY GREEN.

1574
01:32:33,424 --> 01:32:35,625
GIVE US A HAND!

1575
01:32:35,626 --> 01:32:37,894
O.K.

1576
01:32:54,946 --> 01:32:57,947
LEAVING THE
MARY-ANN IS BAD LUCK.

1577
01:32:58,016 --> 01:33:00,150
SWING IT
AROUND WIDE.

1578
01:33:00,151 --> 01:33:02,652
PUT SOME MUSCLE.

1579
01:33:10,028 --> 01:33:12,597
WHERE'D YOU FIND
THAT LITTLE BEAST?

1580
01:33:12,598 --> 01:33:15,232
BEAST?
HE'S A MARINE CORPS DOG.

1581
01:33:15,233 --> 01:33:17,200
I KNOW.
HIYA, MOTO.

1582
01:33:17,201 --> 01:33:19,502
[ARF]

1583
01:33:19,671 --> 01:33:21,204
MOTO, CUT IT OUT!

1584
01:33:21,205 --> 01:33:23,307
GET HIM AWAY,
SERGEANT!

1585
01:33:23,308 --> 01:33:26,075
I'D RATHER NOT
GET HYDROPHOBIA.

1586
01:33:26,344 --> 01:33:27,512
HIS NAME AIN'T MOTO.

1587
01:33:27,513 --> 01:33:28,946
HIS NAME IS TRIPOLI.

1588
01:33:28,947 --> 01:33:29,346
WHAT!

1589
01:33:29,347 --> 01:33:32,049
MAYBE HE DON'T LIKE
BEING CALLED MOTO.

1590
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:32,550
[ARF]

1591
01:33:32,551 --> 01:33:35,351
THAT'S IT.
CUTE TRICK, AIN'T IT?

1592
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,388
YEAH, VERY CUTE.

1593
01:33:43,094 --> 01:33:44,428
HOW'S IT GOING,
RAIDER?

1594
01:33:44,429 --> 01:33:45,830
THEY'RE WITHDRAWING
TO BATAAN.

1595
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:48,598
I THOUGHT IF I CAME
