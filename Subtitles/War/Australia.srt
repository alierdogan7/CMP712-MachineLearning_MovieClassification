Actually, your husband's
a pretty good bloke.

Yes, well, he certainly knows
how to choose his employees.

- Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.

- Lady, I'm not an employee.
- <i>[Scoffs] Really?</i>

- No.

Him being
such a good bloke and all, hmm?

195
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,878
I'm driving you out there because he
promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.

196
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,008
- What, to buy?
- No, you goose. To drove.

- Everything I own...

00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,193
I can fit in my saddlebag,
which is the way I like it.

202
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:41,064
Oh! Yes, well, it's all-
all very "outback adventure," isn't it?

203

- I'm not saying it's for everyone.
- No.

204
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,701
Definitely not for everyone.

205
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,707

You know, land, luggage, other people.

<i>Makes them feel secure.</i>
<i>But all that can be taken away.</i>

207
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,215
And in the end, the only thing
you really own is, uh-

208
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:58,410
