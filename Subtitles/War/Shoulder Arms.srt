00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:07,050
SHOULDER ARMS

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,850
The awkward squad.

3
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,200
"Put those feet in."

4
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,450
Over there.

5
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,850
The enemy.

6
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,750
A quiet lunch.

7
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,450
"Make yourself
at home."

8
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,850
Later.

9
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,250
Changing quard.

10
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,750
"The password --
<i>'It's wet'.</i>"

11
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,250
News from home.

12
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,950
"This must be yours."

13
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,350
"To the day!"

14
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,680
Bed time.

15
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,850
"Stop rocking
the boat!"

16
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,150
Morning.

17
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,680
"Over the top in
fifteen minutes!"

18
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,050
The captured trench.

19
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,500
13 not so unlucky.

20
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,350
"How did you capture
thirteen?"

21
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,950
"I surrounded them."

22
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,550
Poor France.

23
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,250
Two of a kind.

24
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:12,050
A call for volunteers.

25
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,850
"You may never return."

26
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,610
Within the enemy's lines

27
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,550
More heroic work.

28
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,272
"Parle-vous Francais?"

29
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,350
"Me American soldier."

30
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,150
Arrested for aiding
the Allies.

31
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,350
The Kaiser visits
the front.

32
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,700
"Where's the officer?"

33
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,970
"Don't lie -- he's there!"

34
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,350
"We will discuss
your case later."

35
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,630
His pal captured
again.

36
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,390
Prompt action.

37
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,550
"Pay attention to
the war!"

38
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,550
The capture.

39
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,750
Word to the Allies.

40
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,350
Bringing home
the bacon.

41
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:05,150
Peace on earth --
good will
to all mankind.

42
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:38,050
