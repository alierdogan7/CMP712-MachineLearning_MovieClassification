00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,723
Bonjour, madame.

00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,042
Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.

3
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,396
Vive l'Amerique.

4
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,814
Vive la France.

5
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,441
Vive le President Roosevelt.

6
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,168
Vive Le General de Gaulle.

7
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,425
Vive le Radio City Music Hall.

8
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,724
Vive Les Folies Bergere.

9
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:10,273
SAM: First time I saw him,
we'd stopped off in a little town

10
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,401
in the mountains of Southern France.

11
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,570
Up north, at the time,
they were liberating Paris.

12
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,139
That was the big war, the glamour war.

13
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,577
The one they were taking all the pictures
of and writing all the words about.

14
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,663
But we had our own war,

15
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:28,233
And they weren't writing many words
or taking many pictures.

16
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,128
We'd landed near Saint-Tropez.

17
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,902
There wasn't much
resistance on the beaches,

18
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,967
not at all like the day
we got to Sicily or Salerno, or...

19
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,320
Oh, yeah, Anzio.

20
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,807
We started north, and once in a while
the Germans loped over an 88,

21
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,705
and once in a while somebody was killed.

22
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,004
Sometimes it was a friend.

23
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,616
He was one of a truckload of replacements,

24
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,369
and at ﬁrst they looked
like any bunch of new guys...

25
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,972
Too young, too clean and too polished.

26
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:09,224
And they all looked scared...

27
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,318
Except him.

28
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,004
He wasn't scared.

29
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:16,381
He was the kind of a guy you'd notice.

30
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:18,341
You know, take any group of guys,

31
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,177
there's always one that stands out.

32
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,824
(WEAPON FIRING)

33
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,083
Attention!

34
00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,353
Any of you guys know
how to operate a radio?

35
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:32,205
Yes, sir. I do, sir.

36
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,588
Okay, the rest of you guys
can knock it off.

37
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:40,864
What's your name, soldier?

38
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:43,467
Technician 5th grade Britt Harris, sir.

39
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,036
Let's see your Form 20.

40
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,353
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:57,860
Uh-huh.

42
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,301
Graduate of Culver Military Academy,
attended Virginia Military Institute,

43
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,887
Penn State, Colgate and Cornell.

44
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,723
I never met a guy who
went to four colleges before.

45
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,951
How come you're not an officer?

46
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:12,187
Uh, it's rather difficult to explain, sir.

47
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,334
Try.

48
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,543
I wanted to serve with the men, sir.

49
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,799
Would you like to try that again?

50
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,451
Well, there are a few people
I wanted to prove a few things to, sir.

51
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,662
You got anxious a little late.

52
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,706
You been in the Army eight months,
we've been overseas 20 months.

53
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,355
I was deferred, sir, because of my job.

54
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:38,780
Yeah, "General Manager of the Harris
Woolen Mills, Newark, New Jersey."

55
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,633
You're named Harris and the mill's
named Harris. Coincidence, huh?

56
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,531
My father, sir.

57
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,304
That's pretty smart
of you to pick an old man

58
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,056
who owns a textile mill.

59
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,533
Only one?

60
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,043
Four, sir.

61
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,480
My old man was in business, too.

62
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,274
Ran a little candy store in New York.

63
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:59,609
123rd Street, near 8th Avenue.

64
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:04,431
He used to ask me to help him out once
in a while when he had a run on bubble gum.

65
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:08,302
You run that radio right,
and we'll get along fine.

66
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,434
If you don't, I'll boot your tail up
around your neck.

67
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:12,539
Comprenez?

68
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,640
Yes, sir.

69
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,544
Wait around here and I'll check you in
with the room clerk.

70
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,046
Does the, uh, Lieutenant
wish me to carry these, sir?

71
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,491
The Lieutenant wishes for you to knock off
that stateside chicken!

72
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,279
SAM: I needed someone to do Wiley's job.

73
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,082
He was one of the men
we left behind on the beach.

74
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,272
All right, dream boy, up and at 'em!

75
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:38,982
Come on, I got a new radio operator.

76
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,025
Check him in.

78
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,152
The artillery makes the replacements.

79
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,629
Why don't you let the artillery
make the repl...

80
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,155
They make 'em. Why don't you let them?

81
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,740
I mean, you know how the old man...

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,492
Shut your big, fat mouth
and grab a pencil. Come on!

(SIGHS)

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,246
That's not a nice way to talk,
you know that.

85
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,707
Not a nice way to talk for someone
who was just made an officer

86
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,684
and a gentleman, sir.

87
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,443
This guy's from Newark, too.
Do you know him?

88
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,691
Ho, ho.

89
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:08,553
No, I... Well, we're not exactly
buddy-buddies, but I know about him.

90
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,680
Yes, sir, "Corporal Britt Harris.

91
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,059
"Army serial no. 33170247."

92
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,853
You've got yourself a real doozy
this time, Lieutenant.

93
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,105
Would you like to explain that, Corporal?

94
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,231
You mean a "doozy"?

95
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:21,316
Mm-hmm.

96
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,361
Well, a doozy,
in this case, is a celebrity.

97
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:28,031
I mean, Mr. Britt Harris was quite
a celebrity up around our way.

98
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,383
It seems

99
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,410
that a member of the draft board,
of Harris' draft board,

100
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,765
just happened to be working in a factory
that Harris just happened to be running.

101
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:39,793
He tried to bribe him,
he gave him a Chevrolet.

102
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,169
I would've held out for a Cadillac.

103
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,612
Naturally.

104
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,381
What then... What happened then?

105
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,950
Well, he had to enlist. In a hurry.

106
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,611
Huh.

107
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:51,012
Thanks, Corporal.

108
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,472
You're welcome.

109
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,557
Oh, uh... Corporal,

110
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,977
you will keep this to yourself, won't you?

111
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,422
Tear out the fingernails, sir.
Tear out the fingernails.

112
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:04,676
And a very sanitary measure
it would be, too.

113
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:08,468
Don't worry about me, Sam, Lieutenant, sir.
You know me, sir.

114
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:09,906
Big mouth!

115
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,575

but I'd like to borrow your eggs.

00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:14,744

but I kept an eye on him.

00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,341
You see, in our outﬁt we had to get along.

123
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,260
We were a forward observation team.

SAM: Hey, Harris.

128
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,040
Bye-bye.

129
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,363
What are those?

130
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,573
Les oeufs.

131
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:53,199
Did you pay for them?

132
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,410
No, sir. That woman gave them to me.

133
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,557
Why?

134
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:00,774
I don't know why, sir,
but women are always giving me things.

135
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,232
Let me see now, that'll be one for Rogers,

136
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:08,214
one for Harmer,

137
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,383
one for Breglio,

138
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,885
and one for...

139
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,428
No, two for me.

140
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,722
I keep forgetting I'm an officer now.

141
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,183
Yeah, that about leaves
one for you, right?

142
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:19,455
Right.

143
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,147
SAM: I guess I gave him
a rough time, all right.

144
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,774
Partly because I didn't trust him,

145
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:28,878
and partly because he was
born rich and handsome,

146
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,838
and I was born poor and not handsome.

147
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,268
You guys met Harris yet?

148
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:38,369
Uh-huh.

149
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:39,595
Yeah.

150
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,647
I understand he got sort of held up
getting in the army.

151
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,980
We had a couple of dry runs today.
He's pretty good with a radio.

152
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:50,924

It's those replacements.
They went into that other orchard.

158
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,649
I thought everybody knew
that place was loaded with mines!

159
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:09,843
It was marked! I know it was marked!

160
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,802

don't move an inch,
you'll touch off some more mines!

Oh, God, Mama!

173
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,453
You, stop! Hold it there!

174

Don't move, you'll touch off more mines!

a bearing on my clothes.

SAM: One was dead, two had lost legs,
ﬁve were hospital cases.

178
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,695
You're quite a guy, Corporal.

179
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,038
Yes, sir, a real live hero.

180
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:27,458
You want me to pin the medal on you now,
or you wanna wait for the General to do it?

181
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,379
Well, I figured speed was essential, sir.

182
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,110
You ever hear of a little gadget
called a mine detector?

183
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,278
Answer me.

184
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,362
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,073
Didn't you hear me holler for you
to stop when you went in there?

186
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,283
Oh, no, sir.

187
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,885
That's too bad.

188
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:46,956
You got a razor blade in your gear?

189
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,082
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:49,834
Then use it to cut off your stripes,

191
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,561
Private Harris.

192
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,597
'Morning, sir.

193
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:03,723
'Morning, Sam.

194
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,417
Find yourself a place to sit.

195
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,984
I'm, uh, not going to try to persuade you

196
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,257
not to yank this man's stripes,

197
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:20,281
but I thought maybe you'd fill me in
on just what happened.

198
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,658
Nothing much happened, Colonel.

199
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:26,309
It's just that I hollered at him to stop
and he didn't obey orders. That's all.

200
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,730
I can recall a couple times
when you didn't hear an order.

201
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,504
I wouldn't have gone in there. Would you?

202
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,777
You kiddin'? We got too much sense.

203
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,107
Yeah.

204
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,530
You know, I can't quite figure this kid.

205
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:44,247
Maybe you don't have to. No, thanks.

206
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,183
Sam, don't ride the man so hard.

207
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,911
He can't help that he went to college.

208
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:52,563
I was going to put him up for a citation.

209
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:53,648
Oh, don't worry.

210
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:56,693
You'll get plenty of chances
to give this guy a medal.

211
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,010
Sam, um...

212
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,699
How many days have
you and your men been under fire?

213
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,783
Altogether?

214
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,993
Yeah, altogether.

215
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,436
188, 89.

216
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,581
You familiar with the French Riviera?

217
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:12,649
Only what I've read in
the National Geographic.

218
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,878
Well, I'm told that, um...

219
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:19,048
Big hotels are fixed so that
you turn on a water faucet

220
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:21,301
and you get either Cognac or Champagne.

221
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,969
Now that, uh, probably isn't true,

222
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,015
but suppose you and your men go down
there and make a 24-hour investigation.

223
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,662
Yes, sir.

224
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,168
(CHUCKLES)

225
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,330
SAM: An hour later we were
halfway to Nice.

226
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,482
That's the kind of a war it was.

227
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,210
Some people call it
the Champagne Campaign.

228
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,036
Nobody who was there will ever forget

229
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,184
the way the French Riviera
was that season.

230
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,899
The Army had made it a rest area.

231
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:56,686
There'd never been one like it
before and never would be again.

232
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:00,631
They shipped in oranges from North Africa,

233
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,733
eggs from Sweden, steaks from Argentina.

234
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:06,325
The Champagne and Cognac
were already there...

235
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,766
So were some of the girls,

236
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:13,086
but others came by bus,
by foot and by plane.

237
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,959
Oh, there were all kinds of girls.

238
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,028
The hotels were luxurious, all right,

239
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,381
but it wasn't quite like the Colonel said.

240
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,741
You had to go all the way
out to the terrace

241
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,094
to get the Cognac and the Champagne.

242
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:35,142
You can forget how beautiful
a beautiful woman can be,

243
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:40,192
but it doesn't take long
to refresh your memory.

244
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,739
I saw what they meant
by the French Riviera.

245
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,723
After a few hours, I got tired

246
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:36,060
of looking at 10,000 other men
wearing the same suit I was

247
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,812
and doing the same things I was.

248
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:41,291
I left the guys at a bistro
and just took off in the jeep.

249
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,242
Bienvenue, Americain!

250
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,368
Bravo, les Americains!

251
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,494
Ah!

252
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:55,204
Bienvenue, les Americains. Bienvenue!

253
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:56,977
Soyez bienvenu!

254
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:09,986
WITH FRENCH ACCENT:
You are the first American I have seen.

255
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:12,680
I have been thinking

256
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,558
that I must give something
to my first American...

257
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,752
Something I like very much.

258
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,252
BOY: Four...

259
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,354
Cinq, five...

260
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,735
Six, six...

261
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,595
Sept, huit... Sept...

262
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,368
- Sev... Sev...
- Sept...

263
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,349
- Sept, seven...
- Seven...

264
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,623
SAM: I try now to remember
what I thought in that ﬁrst moment...

265
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,354
That she was beautiful, I guess.

266
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,855
BOTH: Quatre, four...

267
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,274
That I wanted very much to speak to her.

268
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:07,047
- Cinq...
- Cinq, five...

269
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,554
Six, six...

270
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,053
Sept, seven...

271
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,261
Huit.

272
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,515
Oh, non, non, non.

273
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,358
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

274
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,965
Uh, mademoiselle, um...

275
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,443
Je suis American.

276
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:34,574
Uh, yes, I know.

277
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,365
You speak English.

278
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:40,793
My mother sometimes says
I speak it perpetually.

279
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,829
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

280
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,402
Lieutenant Sam Loggins.

281
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,004
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

282
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,090
Oh...

283
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,939
I don't understand.

284
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:10,064
He does not know you mean him to keep it.

285
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,925
He has never had a gift before, I think.

286
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,777
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

287
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:22,460
Uh, Lieutenant Sam Loggins,
Jean-Francois Duvan.

288
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,873
Merci bien, monsieur.

289
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,711
You're welcome.

290
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,281
And now I must go. I am very late.

291
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,099
Thank you again and goodbye.

292
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,848
I know Jean-Francois' name,
but I don't know yours.

293
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,705
Oh, I am Monique Blair.

294
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,728
Your English is very good.

295
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,834
I am an American.

296
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,938
You're kidding!
Then why do you talk like that?

297
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,316
Well, I was born in Paris.
I have always lived in France.

298
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,678
And you've never been home...
Uh, to the United States, I mean?

299
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,451
France is my home.

300
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,824
Miss, whatever it is she's
cooking in there smells awful good.

301
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,368
What do you call it?

302
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,186
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Poulpe.

303
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,439
It... It tastes very good, too.

304
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,653
Uh, come, I...
I will introduce you to the madame.

305
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:33,673
Ah, bonjour!

306
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,799
Bonjour.

307
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:36,651
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

308
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,919
That looks good.

309
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,672
Mmm, that's wonderful.

310
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,566
What do they call this?

311
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,418
Uh, uh... Poulpe.

312
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,428
What's it mean?

313
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,715
Octopus.

314
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:02,410
(LAUGHING)

315
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,370
My father felt the same way.

316
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,871
He loved poulpe.

317
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,956
Very nice.

318
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:08,057
(GIGGLING)

319
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,626
(STAMMERS)
Can't you recommend something else?

320
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,855
Uh... The small sardines,
fried crisp in butter.

321
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,110
Could you, uh...

322
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,300
Could you stay and...

323
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,993
Have some with me?

324
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,988
Please?

325
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,132
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

326
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,635
Thank you, ma'am.

327
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,990
Does she give Brandy
to everybody on the house?

328
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,159
- (SNICKERS)
- Madame is French.

329
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,853
It is unlikely that she
has ever done so before,

330
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,064
or that she ever will again.

331
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:49,598
Now...

332
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:53,311
Tell me what happened
after your father died.

333
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,615
Well, I hung around New York for a while,

334
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,343
then I realized that
all the guys I grew up with

335
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,787
were either drafted or in jail.

336
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,574
So I went back to Los Angeles.

337
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,169
Then one day, Mr. Bolling called me
in his office and he said, uh...

338
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:13,130
"Sam, take a look at the new letterheads."

339
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:15,691
So I looked at them and I said,
"They look fine."

340
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,418
And then I saw it.

341
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,760
The letterhead said,
"Bolling and Loggins, Constructionists."

342
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,134
He made me a partner just like that.

343
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,387
And what did you do then?

344
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,481
Well, I thanked him.

345
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,211
You thanked him,

346
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,405
making your voice very deep,

347
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:39,485
then you

348
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,033
excused yourself,

349
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,948
and you went into your own office,

350
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:45,825
closed the door,

351
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,954
and you wept.

352
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,393
You wept because

353
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:54,271
Mr. Fred Bolling is such a good man.

354
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:56,419
Well, to tell you the truth,

355
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,338
I never mentioned this before,
but that's exactly what I did.

356
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:02,554
I wept.

357
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,846
How did you guess that?

358
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,552
Oh, I did not guess.

359
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:08,802
I think

360
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,308
Americans are

361
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,894
ashamed when they feel tenderness.

362
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:15,977
You know, my father once told me...

363
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,045
"Monique, you cannot judge a man,

364
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,692
"by what he says

365
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:21,987
"unless you see his face."

366
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,027
Your father was a very wise man.

367
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:26,387
Oh, yes,

368
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,471
he was,

369
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,539
very wise indeed.

370
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:32,376
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

371
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:40,296
What'd she say?

372
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,590
Uh, oh, ah...

373
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:43,925
She said that

374
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,557
she loved having the Americans here.

375
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,492
Thank you.

376
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:50,060
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

377
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,356
Uh, she wishes you

378
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:01,025
very much good luck.

379
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,758
For me, it will be very bad luck
unless I go home now.

380
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:06,326
My mother will worry.

381
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:12,224
Think I could see you again?

382
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,747
I can get another pass next weekend.

383
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,337
I cannot see you again.

384
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,753
You cannot or you will not?

385
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,587
Will not.

386
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,426
Well, I guess that wraps it up then.

387
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,262
I like you, Sam.

388
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:36,189
I think you are a very good American.

389
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:38,608
But you won't see me again.

390
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,443
I won't see you again.

391
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:46,008
Well, I don't usually
press my luck, but, uh,

392
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,551
if you change your mind,

393
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:50,450
around 8:00 next Saturday night,
I'll be here.

394
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:52,056
Goodbye, Sam.

395
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,703
And thank you again.

396
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:55,102
SAM: When we got back,
it was still the same old war.

397
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,206
It was funny. Some days we drank
Champagne, courtesy of the French,

398
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:02,526
and some days we ate dirt,
courtesy of the Germans.

399
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:06,255
Our objective that morning was a ridge

400
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:08,278
that overlooked a valley
held by the Germans.

401
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,678
The valley was only ﬁve kilometers
from the pass leading into Italy,

402
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,372
but it was a very valuable
piece of real estate.

403
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,353
Intelligence ﬁgured the Jerries
had moved off the ridge,

404
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,501
but intelligence couldn't be sure.

405
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,792
So it was our job to ﬁnd out.

406
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:18,827
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.

407
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:19,928
Fire mission. Over.

408
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,190
You got 'em?

409
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,518
Sugar 3, this is Sugar 7.

410
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:27,836
From Checkpoint 8.

411
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,671
From Checkpoint 8.

412
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:31,068
Azimuth 4000.

413
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:32,991
Azimuth 4000.

414
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,619
SAM: Right 5-0. Drop 2-0.

415
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:38,781
Right 5-0. Drop 2-0.

416
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:41,416
A concrete bunker. Fire for effect.

417
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:42,789
BRITT: Concrete bunker.

418
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,120
Fire for effect. Over.

419
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,714
Here they come.

420
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,201
Duck!

421
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:00,803
(WEAPON FIRING)

422
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:16,910
Okay, that's it.

423
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:19,697
End of mission. Area covered. Out.

424
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,499
There goes our radio.
We're gonna have to wait for support.

425
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,584
(WEAPON FIRING)

426
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:49,685
Duck!

427
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,756
SAM: Then they started paying us back.

428
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,733
We couldn't move in any direction.

429
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,760
We were locked in.

430
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,033
(EXPLOSION)

431
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,740
They got guns, too.

432
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:08,542
I ﬁgured maybe we had ﬁve minutes to live,

433
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,627
give or take a little.

434
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:58,004
You're quite a guy, Harris.

435
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,756
Pretty fancy dancin'.

436
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:05,452
You like your stripes back,
I'll get 'em back for you.

437
00:29:05,552 --> 00:29:06,895
Thanks.

438
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:10,916
Next time we're on a pass together,
I'll buy you a beer.

439
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,768
Thanks, Lieutenant.

440
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,608
It's nothing, Sergeant.

441
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,034
SAM: That night, we took over the bunker,

442
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,787
we started to zero in
on the valley with our howitzers.

443
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,117
We blasted them whenever we saw them.

444
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,544
But the thing is,
we almost never saw them.

445
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,335
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

446
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,261
(WHISTLES)

447
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,813
Peek-a-boo.

448
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:54,626
Hi, Lieutenant.

449
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,170
I'm your new radio operator.
Anderson, Roy.

450
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,613
Hey, Britt.

451
00:29:58,855 --> 00:29:59,856
Hi.

452
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:01,984
You guys know each other?

453
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,929
Sure. We just about got our tails
blown off together. Didn't we, Britt?

454
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:07,014
Yeah.

455
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,140
How's that?

456
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,742
We're in the same bunch of replacements.

457
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,895
Remember that night all those guys went
into that minefield and got blown to hell?

458
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:17,750
Me and old Britt were in there
getting a helmet full of apples.

459
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,945
Okay, Anderson, get on over to the billet.

460
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:24,281
Rustle yourself up a spot to lie down in.

461
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,741
Right you are, Lieutenant.

462
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,684
Take it easy, Britt.

463
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,774
So you'd already explored
the orchard, huh?

464
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,006
You knew pretty much where the mines were.

465
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,858
Uh, well, I wasn't sure.

466
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:47,909
I figured you wouldn't pull a bonehead trick
like that without an angle.

467
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,251
If you'd told me about it,
I wouldn't have yanked your stripes.

468
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,380
But then I guess nobody
would have thought of you as a hero.

469
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:58,582
Did somebody?

470
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,252
You know something?

471
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,489
I can't figure you.
Every time I think I've got you zeroed in,

472
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,182
I gotta figure out another bracket.

473
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,194
SAM: On Saturday night, I was early.

474
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:27,657
I don't know why,
but I really expected her to come.

475
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,072
Anyway, she didn't show.

477
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:43,944
Can I have the check, please?

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

479
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:48,886
Eh, Colette!

480
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:55,851
No, thank you.

481
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:01,604
Lieutenant.

482
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:03,314
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,116
Come, sit down.

484
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:09,285
Let me buy a fellow American a drink.

485
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,556
It's been a long time
since I've had the privilege.

486
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:15,205
You're very kind, but, uh,
I'm sort of in a hurry.

487
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,581
Please.

488
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,151
Beside, I've had enough
to drink for one night.

489
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,820
I thought all American soldiers
drink as much as they can.

490
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,155
As quickly as they can.

491
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:29,598
Some do.

492
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,429
I would, too, if I were a soldier.

493
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,137
You, uh, were waiting for someone.

494
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:37,726
A girl?

495
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,083
If you'll excuse me now,
I have other plans.

496
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:41,918
What other plans,

497
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:43,645
if you don't mind my asking?

498
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,446
No, I don't mind you asking.

499
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,075
Sit down, Sam.

500
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,154
I'm Monique's mother, of course.

501
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:59,728
It was, uh, rather rude of me
to pretend to be otherwise, wasn't it?

502
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,205
Yes, it was.

503
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,291
Are you always so honest?

504
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,167
No, not really.

505
00:33:07,377 --> 00:33:09,696
You ever been
out of the States before, Sam?

506
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,924
No. Well, once, I went to Catalina Island.

507
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:15,619
You like living in Los Angeles?

508
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,746
You're in the construction business.

509
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:19,623
Is there much money in that?

510
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:21,166
Mrs. Blair...

511
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,210
I'm not asking for your daughter's
hand in marriage.

512
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,063
I just wanted to spend
an evening with her.

513
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:27,881
Did you sail from New York?

514
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:28,924
Mm-hmm.

515
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,402
I remember the morning I left.

516
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,658
The sun was shining
and there was just a little haze.

517
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:38,099
That was 20 years ago.

518
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,200
Leaving,

519
00:33:39,492 --> 00:33:41,460
that's what I remember best.

520
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:45,106
I remember there were
some very nice gray ladies.

521
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,709
They gave each of us a cup of coffee

522
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,257
and then word came to board ship,

523
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,406
and each and every one of us stooped down

524
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:56,259
and placed the cup next to his right foot.

525
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,644
And then as the ship
pulled out of the dock,

526
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:04,985
I looked down and saw all of these cups.

527
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:10,407
Some guy behind me said
they looked like rows of tombstones,

528
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,110
and maybe some of them were.

529
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,805
Come on, Sam.

530
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:19,033
Monique's waiting dinner for us.

531
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,936
How do you feel about riding in a jeep?

532
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:27,732
Well, it's one of the several experiences
I promised myself before I die.

533
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:28,833
Uh!

534
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,799
Another is jumping out of a parachute.

535
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,947
No, dear, you jump out of a plane.

536
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:36,015
You hold on to the parachute.

537
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,878
SAM: It was quite a place they lived in.

538
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:50,380
We had a home-cooked meal,

539
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,949
and after dinner,
Monique took me on a tour.

540
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:58,617
During the occupation,

541
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,163
Mama and I each had
an hour alone in this room

542
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,786
every day.

543
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:06,688
Uh, hers was from 3:00 to 4:00
in the afternoon,

544
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,758
and mine was
from 9:00 to 10:00 in the morning.

545
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,151
It's a lovely room.

546
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,298
Yes.

547
00:35:15,505 --> 00:35:17,198
What is this, Monique?

548
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,283
(LAUGHS)

549
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,602
It is a piece of brown bread.

550
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,808
An old family relic?

551
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,146
No.

552
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:28,168
No. There... There was one week

553
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:30,521
when there were 30 of us in the villa...

554
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,025
Mostly refugee children, like...
Like Jean-Francois, remember?

555
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,494
And we had only brown bread
and water to drink.

556
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:43,872
My father said that when the time came
that we had enough again,

557
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:47,921
and there would be such a time, he said,

558
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:51,834
I must not forget
what it is like to be hungry.

559
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,112
So you kept it.

560
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:57,213
Mm-hmm.

561
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,384
Your father must have been quite a guy.

562
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:03,136
When did he die?

563
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:06,352
About two years ago.

564
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,730
I miss him very much.

565
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,611
I'm sure you do.

566
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,755
Sam...

567
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,256
Oh, I've got to run.

568
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,425
I've got to get back to the outfit.
I'm on the midnight shift.

569
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:18,468
Oh.

570
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:20,178
Now that the Germans are gone,

571
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,701
I keep thinking that the war is over.

572
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:24,908
Is it bad?

573
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,768
No, it's been worse,

574
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,604
but it's always bad
when somebody's shooting at you.

575
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:31,272
You be careful, now.

576
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,921
I am the most careful girl in these parts.

577
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,671
Return soon.

578
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:41,049
It has been most pleasant.

579
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:42,884
It was wonderful.

580
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:44,887
Uh, Monique...

581
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:48,766
In America, we have a custom
called a good-night kiss.

582
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:52,019
It is the custom in many countries.

583
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,024
May I kiss you?

584
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:56,906
I should like you to.

585
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:04,914
Good night.

586
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,478
SAM: I had never seen the moon so bright.

587
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,439
Right then, I could've KO'd Joe Louis,

588
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:15,008
hit a homer for the Giants
and climbed an Alp.

589
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,950
I lived for my passes.

590
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,493
We went on a picnic.

591
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:27,036
There was fried chicken, all right,

592
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:30,891
and also pâté de foie-gras sandwiches,
and a view.

593
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:33,710
I'd heard it's the most beautiful
in the world.

594
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,902
I'll buy that.

595
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:37,005
We went pedal-pushing.

596
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:39,233
It's for kids, you know, like me.

597
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:42,594
I made a deal with the Mess Sergeant.

598
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,762
I gave him my liquor ration,

599
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:47,162
and he gave me, well,
a lot more food than it was worth.

600
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,003
I did them in at poker,

601
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,086
and Mrs. Blair murdered me at chess.

602
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:09,183
And then there was
that night in the garden.

603
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,026
I know one thing,
you are not very much for flowers,

604
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:18,147
but in here I planted
these American beauties.

605
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,490
But it is not time for a goodnight kiss.

606
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,415
Mm-hmm, but in America,
some people just don't wait.

607
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:34,729
If they feel like kissing, they kiss.

608
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,002
Kiss, kiss, kiss all the time.

609
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:39,297
That's how I feel

610
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,836
with you.

611
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:49,969
Monique,

612
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,913
remember the day we met

613
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,515
at Madame Brieux's,

614
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:55,375
and she said something to me in French

615
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,210
and I asked you what she said?

616
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,154
And you told me that
she wished me much luck?

617
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,907
Yes, I... I remember.

618
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:05,785
Well, that wasn't what she said.

619
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,199
No.

620
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,370
I consulted an expert
and found out what she really said was,

621
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,540
she wished for me a great love.

622
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,289
Now, that was quite a thing
for her to say because,

623
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,440
well,

624
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,276
I'm not much of a catch.

625
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:24,153
As a matter of fact,
nobody ever tried to catch me,

626
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:27,097
and I've never tried
to catch anybody either.

627
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:29,384
Well...

628
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,559
What I'm trying to say is that

629
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:36,474
I love you, Monique.

630
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:38,397
I love you very much.

631
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:46,697
But you don't love me.

632
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:49,237
No, Sam.

633
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,156
Well...

634
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:54,416
You can't win 'em all.

635
00:39:55,118 --> 00:39:56,415
Sam,

636
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:59,422
when I came home that first afternoon,

637
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,608
I said to my mother...

638
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,131
"I have met a very nice American

639
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,863
"from Los Angeles, California.

640
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:09,282
"A lieutenant," I said.

641
00:40:09,382 --> 00:40:11,760
"And it would be my dearest wish

642
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:14,521
"that he would like me,

643
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,856
"and that he want me

644
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,808
"as a friend."

645
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,357
I still wish that.

646
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:24,356
I'll settle for that for now.

647
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:29,611
Mmm, that love-at-first-sight routine
rarely happens anyway,

648
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,620
and we've got time.

649
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:34,491
I'll try to make you love me,

650
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,185
and I hope you will.

651
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,287
No, Sam. There is no such hope.

652
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:43,254
You... You can't stop me from trying.

653
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,759
I can stop seeing you.

654
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,341
I will.

655
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,226
That's fine.

656
00:40:59,682 --> 00:41:01,793
I always say, "If you're going
to kick a guy in the teeth,

657
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,736
"be sure to use both feet."

658
00:41:05,688 --> 00:41:07,632
It is for you that I have said that.

659
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:08,904
Thanks a lot.

660
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,402
Sam!

661
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:12,528
Sam.

662
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:14,555
I was just shoving off.

663
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:15,932
Sam, I was listening.

664
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,832
Well, good for you. It will save
a lot of time, a lot of trouble.

665
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:21,712
Come in.

666
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:24,708
Come in, Sam.

667
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,667
Please.

668
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:53,365
Uh, sit down, Sam, please.

669
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,211
I have had something to tell you

670
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:09,044
ever since that first afternoon.

671
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,512
I did not because

672
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:14,382
I did not see any point to it then.

673
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,636
No, that...

674
00:42:19,428 --> 00:42:21,055
That is not true.

675
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,892
I did not because

676
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,811
I liked you.

677
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:28,441
Uh, I still do,

678
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:31,065
but...

679
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,238
I... I

680
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:35,411
know how Americans

681
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,363
feel about some things.

682
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:40,825
I have read and

683
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:44,121
I know the way so many
of the soldiers talk.

684
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:47,648
I...

685
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:49,295
I have told you

686
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:52,111
that my father

687
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:53,963
was a very great man.

688
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,016
Believe me, he was.

689
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:09,191
He was also a negro.

690
00:43:25,578 --> 00:43:26,795
I guess

691
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,022
"nigger" is

692
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:31,422
one of the first words
you learn in America, isn't it?

693
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,474
Good... Goodbye, Sam.

694
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:55,650
Monique's father was a rare man.

695
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:04,242
I've never known another like him.

696
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:15,838
This picture was taken
a year before he died.

697
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,857
Fred was a poor boy

698
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:30,310
from Georgia.

699
00:44:31,227 --> 00:44:33,355
His mother took in washing

700
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:36,361
and he never knew his father.

701
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,777
But he ran errands,

702
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,178
he swept floors,

703
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,407
he dug ditches to get through
Hampton Institute.

704
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:48,707
And at 35, he was president of
an insurance company in Philadelphia.

705
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:59,221
I was a public health nurse
in West Virginia.

706
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,593
When I went back home to Philadelphia,

707
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:07,480
I met him for the first time
at a welfare conference.

708
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:11,396
I fell in love with him

709
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:14,521
and married him.

710
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:18,070
I didn't care what color his skin was.

711
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:20,989
He was the finest,

712
00:45:21,527 --> 00:45:24,246
dearest man I've ever known in my life.

713
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,717
When the time came,

714
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:44,805

717
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,062
"There are ways," I said.

722
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,703

724
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,378

726
00:46:21,003 --> 00:46:23,097
"It is the will of God."

727
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:29,478

Why do you say that?

894
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:34,488
Because I know him, and I know
he knows all the angles.

895
00:59:34,588 --> 00:59:35,947
That is a good trait, I think.

896
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:39,017
Maybe, if you don't play poker
with him too often.

897
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,412
It was a beautiful evening

898
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,764
and night

899
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,398
and sunrise.

900
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:47,184
Thank you.

901
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,211
You're welcome, Monique.

902
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:50,337
Good night.

903
00:59:50,437 --> 00:59:51,438
Sam...

904
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,113
Thank you for coming back.

905
00:59:58,486 --> 00:59:59,487
Will...

906
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:02,457
Will you tell Britt about me?

907
01:00:05,493 --> 01:00:06,995
I'll tell him.

908
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:22,994
Sam?

909
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:24,037
Uh-huh?

910
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:26,206
What are you going
to do when the war's over?

911
01:00:26,306 --> 01:00:28,650
Probably go back to Los Angeles.

912
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,627
Why don't you come and work with me?

913
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:31,711
Huh.

914
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:32,754
You think we'd get along?

915
01:00:32,854 --> 01:00:33,855
Great.

916
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:36,383
Just so long as we know who's the boss.

917
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:37,484
You.

918
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:43,990
Sam...

919
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:48,544
How serious are you about Monique?

920
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,957
What do you mean?

921
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,547
Well, um...

922
01:00:55,669 --> 01:00:57,342
Uh, how serious?

923
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:01,140
We're just good friends.

924
01:01:02,217 --> 01:01:03,514
That all?

925
01:01:05,136 --> 01:01:06,513
That's all.

926
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:12,857
I like her a lot, Sam.

927
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:17,402
I like her a lot.

928
01:01:20,026 --> 01:01:21,528
I believe you.

929
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:25,140
You want to go with me
next time we get a pass?

930
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,559
Her mother cooks up some pretty fair chow.

931
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:28,831
Great.

932
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:34,291
She asked me to tell you something, Britt.

933
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,719
She asked me to tell you that

934
01:01:38,712 --> 01:01:40,714
her father was a negro.

935
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:47,766

937
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,455
SAM: That's the way it was.

938
01:02:09,576 --> 01:02:11,686
You'd think the war was over and wham,

939
01:02:11,786 --> 01:02:13,834
it started all over again.

940
01:02:14,414 --> 01:02:16,416
And this time it didn't stop.

941
01:02:17,459 --> 01:02:20,008
Three days later,
they were still sending them in.

(COUGHING)

943
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:05,089
Britt.

944
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:22,340
Sam, I'd love to sneak up behind 'em
and see what's going on.

945
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,818
You can't see anything from here.

946
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:28,847
You know, there's one spot
where you can see the whole works from...

947
01:03:28,947 --> 01:03:30,244
Checkpoint 30.

948
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,558
That's the town hall tower.

949
01:03:31,658 --> 01:03:32,875
Yeah.

950
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:36,021
And you can bet it ain't well-manned.

951
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:37,897
This is too good a target for us.

953
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,344
You know, I'll bet a couple
of guys could get in there.

01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:53,180

Don't they ever run out?

I sure would like to take a whack at it.

959
01:04:03,356 --> 01:04:05,901
Samuel, what's the first
thing you learned...

960
01:04:06,025 --> 01:04:08,928
The very first thing you learned
in basic training?

961
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:10,138
Never to volunteer for anything.

962
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:11,410
Right.

963
01:04:11,823 --> 01:04:14,042
I still think we could do it.

964
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,331
"We" could do it?

965
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,398
You don't think I'd be idiot enough
to go alone?

966
01:04:20,498 --> 01:04:21,691
Sam, you don't seem to understand...

967
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,668
Here, cocktail hour.

(EXPLOSION)

969
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,728
Did he go for the town hall idea,
or did he think we were nuts?

970
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:44,672
No, he didn't think we were nuts.
He said he'd pass it on to headquarters.

971
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:45,799
Well, that's the end of that.

972

If you want to bury something in the army,

973
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:49,302
all you do is you send it
through channels in triplicate.

974
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:51,012
He didn't take away
our overnight pass, though?

975
01:04:51,112 --> 01:04:52,639
He wouldn't dare. (LAUGHS)

Oh, uh, Britt...

01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:01,940
I've seen you in action, comrade,
and I just wanted you to know

979
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,920
that Monique is a very nice girl,
and she bruises easily. I know.

980
01:05:07,754 --> 01:05:11,241
You're not going to believe this, Sam,
but before I put on this Buster Brown outfit,

981
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:14,828
I went out with a couple of nice girls
and never had any complaints.

982
01:05:14,928 --> 01:05:17,022
- Allez?
- Allons!

983
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:25,797
SAM: And he was wonderful
with her, of course.

984
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:27,549
He even knew all about flowers.

985
01:05:27,649 --> 01:05:32,137
They liked the same books, the same music,
and they spoke the same language... French.

986
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:34,205
They both liked Picasso and...

987
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:36,599
There was one other thing...

988
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,768
She was in love with him.

989
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,791
I didn't know about him.

990
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:43,628
I never knew about him.

almost every pass together

992
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:56,077
and it was always the same...

993
01:05:56,177 --> 01:05:58,726
There were the two of them, and me.

of a wine drinker,

Oh, Sam,

1010
01:06:47,145 --> 01:06:48,922
you should not drink chablis that way.

1011
01:06:49,022 --> 01:06:51,650
It is a tender wine.
It must be sipped only.

Huh.

Sam, I think you're familiar
with the term "love."

with the poetry.

this was going to happen!

or not, that's beside the point.

01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,944
Besides, I've got a little money
going for me.

1072
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:47,012
I've got a trust fund.
So maybe we'll even settle here.

1073
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:48,465
I don't know.

1074
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:54,895
When, Sergeant?

1075
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:58,416
You know how the Army is, Sam.

1076
01:12:58,516 --> 01:13:01,294
There's a right way
and there's a wrong way.

1077
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:02,520
When?

1078
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,301
The Chaplain, the Colonel,
everything in triplicate,

1079
01:13:08,401 --> 01:13:10,052
right through channels.

1080
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,904
I suggest that you begin today.

1081
01:13:13,114 --> 01:13:16,038
Sam, I was going to ask you
to be my best man.

1082
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:18,540
I'd be delighted.

1083
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:22,086
Sammy, don't you trust me?

1084
01:13:28,254 --> 01:13:30,256
I just remembered I forgot something.

1085
01:13:36,303 --> 01:13:37,850
Congratulations.

1086
01:13:38,097 --> 01:13:39,440
Thanks.

1087
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:51,928
Hello, Sam.

1088
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,746
Good morning, dear.

1089
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:57,871
For me?

1090
01:14:19,096 --> 01:14:20,473
Did you make him ask her?

1091
01:14:22,141 --> 01:14:23,313
Oh, no.

1092
01:14:25,144 --> 01:14:27,192
What... What do you think, Sammy?

1093
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,490
Well, I'm not exactly neutral.

1094
01:14:31,025 --> 01:14:32,493
No, you're not.

1095
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,780
It won't be easy for them,

1096
01:14:36,322 --> 01:14:38,074
even at best.

1097
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:42,662
You know what I bet?
I bet everything turns out just dandy.

1098
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:45,915
Maybe.

1099
01:14:46,624 --> 01:14:48,217
I hope that's true.

1100
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:50,928
Monique...

1101
01:14:51,337 --> 01:14:54,181
Well, I've protected her, and I'm

1102
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,558
not sure I was right.

1103
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,453
Britt is handsome,

1104
01:14:59,553 --> 01:15:00,975
charming.

1105
01:15:01,222 --> 01:15:03,475
My daughter loves him.

1106
01:15:05,184 --> 01:15:06,185
When he...

1107
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:10,398
Came to me this morning
with those great eyes

1108
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,677
that must have got him so much
and saved him so much.

1109
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:15,778
Mm-hmm.

1110
01:15:16,028 --> 01:15:17,905
He told me that he loved her

1111
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,157
and wanted to marry her.

1112
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,452
Well, I said what I said.

1113
01:15:27,081 --> 01:15:29,675
Now, go wish her
all the happiness there is.

1114
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:37,759
(DOOR CLOSES)

1115
01:15:47,768 --> 01:15:48,940
Howdy.

1116
01:15:50,104 --> 01:15:51,964
I was hoping you would come.

1117
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:54,842
I thought I'd better report in
and see how you are.

1118
01:15:54,942 --> 01:15:58,037
(STAMMERING)
Uh, did Britt tell you... Tell you?

1119
01:15:58,904 --> 01:16:01,932
Oh, he was blabbering about
love and marriage and all that stuff.

1120
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:05,144
I didn't quite understand
what he was talking about.

1121
01:16:05,244 --> 01:16:06,687
I am very happy.

1122
01:16:06,787 --> 01:16:08,164
That's good.

1123
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:09,290
I am in love.

1124
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,860
I guess that's about all anybody can ask.

1125
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,928
It is a very great deal.

1126
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,490
And there is even more.

1127
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,908
Oh, there couldn't be.

1128
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:20,260
Yes.

1129
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:24,438
That first night,

1130
01:16:24,763 --> 01:16:26,390
uh, when he was here,

1131
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:28,397
we went into the garden

1132
01:16:29,435 --> 01:16:31,062
and he looked at me, and

1133
01:16:31,437 --> 01:16:32,859
he said...

1134
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:35,491
"Sam has told me about your father.

1135
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,198
"You must be very proud of him."

1136
01:16:40,613 --> 01:16:43,457
You can see, can you not,
that I worship Britt?

1137
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:48,496
I think you've got it all taped,
all buttoned up.

1138
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,964
You approve then?

1139
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:57,863
Well, I wouldn't want to get this around,

1140
01:16:57,963 --> 01:16:59,949
(WHISPERING)
but I'm puttin' in for best man.

1141
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:01,742
You think I got a chance?

1142
01:17:01,842 --> 01:17:02,827
Oh!

1143
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:05,555
I shall speak to the man in charge.

1144
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:16,590
Hey, Sam, I thought
you weren't coming back.

1145
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,987
I'm back.

1146
01:17:18,943 --> 01:17:19,927
Britt?

1147
01:17:20,027 --> 01:17:21,028
Hmm?

1148
01:17:21,695 --> 01:17:23,055
You're not kiddin' this time, are you?

1149
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:25,249
You're not just foolin' around?

1150
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,997
Sam, I'm in love with the girl.

1151
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:29,332
Okay.

1152
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,647
There's just one thing worries me.

1153
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,999
What's that?

1154
01:17:33,123 --> 01:17:35,568
I haven't got a thing
to wear for this wedding.

1155
01:17:35,668 --> 01:17:36,669
(LAUGHS)

1156
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:52,856
SAM: He got the marriage application
the next day.

1157
01:17:56,522 --> 01:17:58,900
A month passed and then another,

1158
01:17:59,233 --> 01:18:00,926
and the Germans kept pouring them in,

1159
01:18:01,026 --> 01:18:03,512
and every week,
a few more men were killed.

1160
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,848
But there was still
no word on the mission.

1161
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:08,201
Finally, the old man sent for me.

1162
01:18:12,663 --> 01:18:14,006
Hi, Lieutenant.

1163
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:19,695
He'll be with you in just a minute.
He just got back from regiment.

1164
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,115
Havin' a little conference with the staff,
you see. Take a load off, Lieutenant.

1165
01:18:23,215 --> 01:18:24,888
Thank you, Corporal.

1166
01:18:26,385 --> 01:18:27,386
1725...

1167
01:18:27,886 --> 01:18:29,288
Tell me, uh...

1168
01:18:29,388 --> 01:18:31,790
How's the pride of Newark, New Jersey
making out?

1169
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,710
He's turning out to be
a damn fine soldier.

1170
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:35,902
Yeah?

1171
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,398
You know what General Grant always said.

1172
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:41,363
No, what did General Grant "always said"?

1173
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:43,177
I don't know. He just, uh...

1174
01:18:43,277 --> 01:18:45,095
(LAUGHS) He said somethin'.

1175
01:18:45,195 --> 01:18:47,765
By the way, how's our boy's
marriage application coming along?

1176
01:18:47,865 --> 01:18:50,744
It's been in the works
for over two months now.

1177
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:53,833
Are you kiddin'? He picked those papers
up here about three weeks ago.

1178
01:18:54,204 --> 01:18:57,003
He just never brought 'em back.
I don't know.

1179
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,150
Wait a minute.

1180
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,153
Oh, yeah. Hey, listen, I, uh,
I mentioned that to him about,

1181
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:03,656
uh, a couple of days ago.
You know what he said?

1182
01:19:03,756 --> 01:19:05,532
He said the whole thing was a gag.

1183
01:19:05,632 --> 01:19:07,409
It was just a big gag.

1184
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,637
(LAUGHING) He's a character.

1185
01:19:09,762 --> 01:19:11,372
You know what I figured?
I mean, personally,

1186
01:19:11,472 --> 01:19:13,374
I figure that some French mama

1187
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:15,101
put the squeeze on our boy, you know,

1188
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:17,878
but he, uh, he smoothed himself out of it.

1189
01:19:17,978 --> 01:19:19,505
You know him, he's quite a smoother.

1190
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:21,278
Oh, he is quite a smoother.

1191
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:26,070
Sam, regimental headquarters
approved your plan.

1192
01:19:27,946 --> 01:19:30,349
You haven't changed your mind, have you?

1193
01:19:30,449 --> 01:19:31,475
No, sir.

1194
01:19:31,575 --> 01:19:32,576
All right.

1195
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:37,481
Sam, I think you know everybody.

1196
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,024
Yes, sir. Hi, Sam.

1197
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:41,694
Hour is 0300 at hill 209.

1198
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:43,195
I'll personally see you off.

1199
01:19:43,295 --> 01:19:46,031
When you get to town hall,
set up an OP and check in

1200
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:47,449
and report all activity while en route.

1201
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:48,534
Yes, sir.

1202
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:51,036
Now, Captain Harrison
will brief you on net operation.

1203
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:54,060
You won't follow
any regular radio procedure.

1204
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:55,853
FDC will be alerted.

1205
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,628
Two men will monitor the net
at all times for your signals.

1206
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:03,403
Now, when you reach the tower,
switch on your radio and say...

1207
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:05,384
"Established."

1208
01:20:05,484 --> 01:20:06,468
Any questions?

1209
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,553
No, sir.

1210
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:08,595
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1211
01:20:08,695 --> 01:20:10,322
Anything else?

1212
01:20:10,948 --> 01:20:13,267
Well, I guess that about covers it.

1213
01:20:13,367 --> 01:20:15,165
Thank you, gentlemen.

1214
01:20:25,379 --> 01:20:27,614
Sir, does this mean
our passes are cancelled?

1215
01:20:27,714 --> 01:20:29,716
Yeah, I'm afraid it does.

1216
01:20:30,509 --> 01:20:34,663
Well, sir, it's important that Sergeant Harris
and I get into town for a little while.

1217
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,874
It's, um, personal and it's...

1218
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:38,375
It's pretty important, sir.

1219
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:40,352
But I promise to get us back by 0100.

1220
01:20:40,811 --> 01:20:42,313
I guarantee it.

1221
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:46,425
All right, Sam. You wouldn't ask if it
weren't important. Permission granted.

1222
01:20:46,525 --> 01:20:49,870
I'll pick you and the Sergeant up
at your billet at 0200.

1223
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,367
Yes, sir.

1224
01:20:55,701 --> 01:20:57,874
(HUMMING)

1225
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:02,775
Lieutenant Sam? Yeah.

1226
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:04,127
Any news?

1227
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:05,881
Yeah, we've got it.

1228
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:08,572
Tonight's the night. Hour is 0300.

1229
01:21:08,672 --> 01:21:10,324
Well, that cancels our soufflés.

1230
01:21:10,424 --> 01:21:13,052
No, but we've got to be back by 0100.

1231
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:15,308
Well, I'll shake a leg.

1232
01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:18,374
It would've been nice if your papers
had come through.

1233
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,292
Yeah, that would've been great.

1234
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:23,837
I went by headquarters this morning
and they told me it takes a lot of time.

1235
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:25,464
Well, you know how it is.

1236
01:21:25,564 --> 01:21:29,410
You know, I sometimes think the Army
doesn't want people to get married.

1237
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:33,660
The ladies expect you, gentlemen.

1238
01:21:34,573 --> 01:21:36,450
Beautiful, you're beautiful.

1239
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,144
I couldn't get you a mink coat
or a bag of diamonds today

1240
01:21:39,244 --> 01:21:41,397
'cause they didn't have any in the PX,
so I got you these.

1241
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,024
- Oh, that's sweet of you, Britt.
- Well, I'm a very sweet fellow.

1242
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:46,151
- MRS. BLAIR: How are you, Sammy?
- He's not feeling well at all.

1243
01:21:46,251 --> 01:21:47,820
All the way down the hill,
he didn't say a word.

1244
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,198
But I have a feeling that that chocolate
soufflé with those black-market eggs

1245
01:21:51,298 --> 01:21:55,223
- is going to clear up his mind beautifully.
- You touch her, and I'll kill you.

1246
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:05,778
Tell her.

1247
01:22:09,942 --> 01:22:12,845
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

1248
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:14,822
I talked to Corporal Lindsay today.

1249
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,144
He's not much
of a conversationalist, is he?

1250
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:21,587
Tell her!

1251
01:22:23,121 --> 01:22:25,107
You really want me to, Lieutenant?

1252
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,401
Like you thought it over real hard?

1253
01:22:27,501 --> 01:22:28,878

1254
01:22:30,587 --> 01:22:31,634

01:22:32,256 --> 01:22:33,473
Monique.

1256
01:22:41,807 --> 01:22:43,855
Uh, I guess...

1257
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,029
I guess what Sam means is

1258
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,941
I'm not going to marry you, Monique.

1259
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:53,860
That's about it, I guess.

1260
01:23:02,327 --> 01:23:04,796
You never even planned to, did you?

1261
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:09,459
You scum.

1262
01:23:10,002 --> 01:23:12,404
I don't like that word, coming from you.

1263
01:23:12,504 --> 01:23:14,256
Get out of my house.

1264

1265
01:23:17,968 --> 01:23:20,287
On several occasions,
I've been engaged to marry,

1266
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:24,108
and on several occasions I've been not
engaged to marry, if you follow me.

1267
01:23:25,642 --> 01:23:29,363
And a lot of these girls I wouldn't
take to a country club, but

01:23:29,855 --> 01:23:32,859
with the exception of your daughter,
Mrs. Blair,

1269
01:23:33,025 --> 01:23:35,073
all of them were white.

01:23:40,824 --> 01:23:42,226

1272
01:23:42,326 --> 01:23:44,203

I'll find her.

1280

Captain, Captain,
it was I who rescued her.

1281
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,560
I was coming home slowly,
taking my leisure

1282
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,395
because it is so beautiful an evening,

1283
01:25:08,495 --> 01:25:10,230
then I saw the girl running fast.

1284
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,441
At first, I think she's going
to a rendezvous,

1285
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,651
but then I recognize she's trying to jump.

1286
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:17,971
I was very close behind her,
but below are many rocks...

1291
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:38,800

When I saw Monique's face,

when I left her mother at the villa

1297
01:26:44,883 --> 01:26:46,726
or when I got back.

1298
01:26:55,227 --> 01:26:56,900
Now, any questions?

1299
01:26:57,062 --> 01:26:58,255
No, sir.

01:26:58,355 --> 01:27:01,404
I'm gonna have to take
your sidearm and your rifle.

Sir?

If you don't have weapons,
you'll hide instead of trying to shoot.

1303

Now, you can carry your knives.

but I'm going to kill you.

Sam, I'm not proud of what I did.

01:28:23,315 --> 01:28:24,817
I apologize.

Or maybe I'll say,
"He stepped on a mine, sir. It was awful."

they found your body,

01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:55,517

1388

One of those, uh, secret organizations

1389
01:35:57,643 --> 01:35:59,504
where they give you a secret handshake,

1390

and then they

1391
01:36:01,898 --> 01:36:05,534
bend you over and then paddle
your fanny till you can't sit down.

1392
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:11,996
Well, I happened to overhear two of
my fraternity brothers talking one night.

1393
01:36:12,283 --> 01:36:14,519
They were talking about me. One said...

1394

"Gee, that Britt.
Hmm, boy, he's got everything.

And then... And then the other one said...

1400
01:36:28,257 --> 01:36:31,511
"Yeah, that Britt, he's got everything,
except one thing.

1401

"He hasn't any character."

I see something I want,

1414
01:37:07,463 --> 01:37:08,931
I ask myself...

1415
01:37:10,049 --> 01:37:12,643
"What do I have to say to get it?"

1416
01:37:15,138 --> 01:37:16,685

Plug in, Sergeant.

you're crazy.

1422
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:40,104
You ain't going nowhere, buddy.
You're staying right here with me.

and the chances are awful slim,

1432
01:38:09,609 --> 01:38:11,886

or what was left of me.

1486
01:44:03,754 --> 01:44:06,553
I was in the hospital in Paris
for seven months.

1487
01:44:07,758 --> 01:44:12,184
When I got out, I had $4,967 in back pay,

1488
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:15,934
and I was one of the displaced.

1489
01:44:18,519 --> 01:44:21,739
I'd had two letters from Monique
while I was in the hospital.

1490
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:23,990
"Dear friend," the ﬁrst one began.

1491
01:44:24,108 --> 01:44:25,885
"I think of you often."

1492
01:44:25,985 --> 01:44:29,346
And at the end, she added,
almost as an afterthought,

1493
01:44:29,446 --> 01:44:32,141
"I have met a soldier
named Harmer in Nice.

1494
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:34,685
"He said that Britt Harris was dead."

1495

That was all.

1496
01:44:36,912 --> 01:44:39,290
I was glad she could write it like that.

1497
01:44:39,832 --> 01:44:42,255
The second letter was also short.

1498
01:44:42,626 --> 01:44:45,675
It merely said that her mother
had died the week of VE Day.

1499
01:44:46,922 --> 01:44:48,866
I didn't answer the letters. I...

1500
01:44:48,966 --> 01:44:51,139
I didn't really know what to say.

1501
01:45:00,185 --> 01:45:02,563
And then one afternoon
as I took my ﬁrst sip

1502
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:05,341
of what must have been my 2,000th beer,

1503
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:08,820
I saw myself in the ring
the glass left on the table.

1504
01:45:08,986 --> 01:45:11,388
I realized then that I'd known
guys like me

01:45:11,488 --> 01:45:13,474
left over from the ﬁrst war.

1506
01:45:13,574 --> 01:45:15,768
They got shot up
at the Battle of the Meuse

1507
01:45:15,868 --> 01:45:19,168
and spent the next 20 years
brooding about it. I'd had it.

1508
01:45:23,876 --> 01:45:26,904
I went to the American Express
and sent a cable to my partner...

1509

"Reporting back three weeks from today.

1510

"Meantime, taking small
sentimental journey."

01:46:26,063 --> 01:46:27,565
Yes, you have.

1520
01:46:32,403 --> 01:46:34,030
And you have lost one arm.

1521
01:46:35,739 --> 01:46:38,434
So I have. I've never even missed it.

1522
01:46:38,534 --> 01:46:40,912
But one is enough for anybody, and beside,

a brand new one.

No.

1526
01:46:55,467 --> 01:46:57,094
I will find her.

I remind them of something
my mother told me.

01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:14,196
She said,

1538
01:48:14,296 --> 01:48:17,516

has some kind of a burden,
