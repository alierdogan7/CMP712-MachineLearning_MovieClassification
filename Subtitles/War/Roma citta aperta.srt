<i>The events and characters

<i>Any resemblance to

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,157

"The Voice of London."

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,188
Jesus.

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,396
I'm coming, I'm coming.

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,360
- The engineer, Giorgio Manfredi?
- He's not here.

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,112
- Where is he?
- We don't know...

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,192
- he doesn't always sleep at home.
- Where does he go?

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,273
I don't know. One can imagine,
a young single man...

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,750
- Right. Which is his room?
- Over there.

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,433
Search the house.

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,718
Many people visit him?

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,836
Nobody's come around
for some time.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,194
Of course.

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,435
- How many more guests do you have?
- Two.

20
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,270
- Where is the telephone?
- End of the hall.

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,159
Stop, I'll answer it.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,908
Yes, hello?

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,479
Is Giorgio there?

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,077
Yes, Manfredi.
Who am I talking to?

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,309
I'm a friend of the engineer.

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,311
- What friend?
- Who am I talking to?

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,430
- It was a woman. Who was she?
- How do I know? Could I see her?

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,750
- Have you found anything?
- No, nothing.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,991
- What about this door?
- It leads to the terrace.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,275
Ah, the terrace.

31
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,998
Calm down, would you?

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,194
- Who lives there?
- It's the Spanish Embassy.

33
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,238
The city will be divided
into 14 zones,

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,960
the Schrueder Plan
that we have already applied

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,633
in various European cities

36
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,475
allows for scientific regrouping
of large masses of men,

37
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,312
using the same forces.

38
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,074
Come in.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,031
N.C.O. Babber has communicated

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,714
that they haven't found
the person they were looking for.

41
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,869
Doesn't surprise me.

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,033
If you say, I'll tell them
to bring in the girl and landlady.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,634
No, it's not necessary, thank you.

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,038
Bad news?

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,111
Someone didn't turn up
for an appointment.

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,633
Anyone important?

47
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,355
I hope so.

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,514
Do you know them?

49
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,079
No. Who are they?

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,391
He says his name's Manfredi,
an engineer.

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,151
Manfredi?

52
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,799
This man's already on file.

53
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,916
Seems he's one of the heads
of the military command

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,672
of the National
Liberation Committee.

55
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,798
I've got reason to believe
beyond a doubt it's him.

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,110
But how did you catch him?

57
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,113
I found him here,
on this table.

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,392
Every night I take
a very long walk

59
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,677
through the streets of Rome,
without leaving my office.

60
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,400
I love this photographic genre

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,710
that catches people
almost by surprise.

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,519
You find some
very interesting people.

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,511
Not long ago, case in point,

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,752
I remember they came to
my knowledge Mr. Manfredi

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,276
and his little friend;
I said to myself:

66
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,036
I've seen this man
somewhere before.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,559
Take a good look

68
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,073
at this group.

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,158
Second on the right.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,311
They sent me these photos
from Berlin,

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,639
and I don't think
I'm mistaken, am I?

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,276
You're right. It's him.
It's the same person.

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,556
What a nuisance.
Sorry.

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,755
Don't worry about it.

75
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,114
What's all that racket?

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,829
Excuse me, Major. We've started
to interrogate the professor.

77
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,348
Good, but get them to shut up.

78
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,236
- How these Italians scream.
- Right.

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,077
Who is the girl?

80
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,674
Marina, an chorus girl.

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,028
Yes, I know her.
I've seen her. Charming.

82
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,553
Very charming.

83
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,754
Slow down. Take it easy.

84
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,868
But, what's happening?

85
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,270
Can't you see?
They're looting the bakery.

86
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,193
- What's your business in this?
- Unfortunately, I'm on duty.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,555
- I feel helpless.
- I know, when refugees arrive.

88
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,678
He's got no shame.
He even had little cakes.

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,673
- That's a good one.
- Even dared to say he had no flour.

90
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,478
Why don't you join us?

91
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,712
I'm the sexton.
If I do, I'll go to hell.

92
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,916
Give me that.
You can eat it in heaven.

93
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,718
Hands off!

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,639
This is an offense.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,392
What do I do, die of hunger?

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,948
Officer! Help!

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,276
Go to hell, you creep.

98
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,429
I'll go with you.

99
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,712
- We're here.
- Thanks.

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,280
Your welcome.
Want me to take you up?

101
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,878
Here, it's lighter this way.

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,669
I really shouldn't, but I've
been hungry so long.

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,198
Mrs. Pina, what do you think,

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,476
do you think those Americans
will get here after all?

105
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,634
Looks like it.

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,278
- Mrs. Pina. Got anything?
- Come on, leave me alone.

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,396
How dare you,
in my presence?

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,675
You've got no manners.

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,118
It's better not to take any notice.
See you later.

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,349
Goodbye.

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,475
Who are you looking for?

112
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,917
Does Francesco the printer
live here?

113
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,719
- Yes, but he's not in.
- Do you know where he's gone?

114
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,711
How do I know?
Off on some job.

115
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,838
- Excuse me, who are you?
- You're excused. What's it to you?

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,911
I understand you are Mrs. Pina.

117
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,274
How do you know?

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,351
Francesco always talked about you.

119
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,397
- But you are...
- A friend.

120
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,869
How stupid, I took you
for a cop.

121
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,359
Tell me. What do you want?

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,557
- I should go into Francesco's.
- I'll get the key and open up.

123
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,511
Sorry, I had trouble finding it.

124
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,148
Come in.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,673
- Please.
- Thanks.

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,074
The place is dirty
and a mess.

127
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,391
I understand.
Do you know Don Pietro?

128
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,313
Parish priest of San Clemente.
I want to talk to him.

129
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,914
- I'll get him if you want.
- No, not you.

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,310
- Then I'll send my boy.
- Yes, that'll be better.

131
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,993
- Wait here for me.
- Thanks.

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,999
Marcello! Marcello!

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,598
Marcello!

134
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,669
- What do you want?
- Come down a moment.

135
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,716
I can't.

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,791
You've got to get Don Pietro.
Look lively.

137
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,952
- I got a lot of things to do.
- I'm telling you, come down now.

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,877
I told you many times, don't play
with Remoleto. He's trouble.

139
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,996
- Go and get Don Pietro.
- And what do I say?

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,196
Tell him to come right away.

141
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,512
And don't get lost on the way.

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,789
He's gone.
Don Pietro won't be long.

143
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,915
Thank you.

144
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,071
We looted the bakery this morning.

145
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,070
Oh, yeah?

146
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,073
- Second one this week.
- Why did the women go?

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,237
Some know why they do it,

148
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,068
but most get
more punches than rolls.

149
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,239
This morning one of them got
a pair of shoes and some scales.

150
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,868
I'd like to know who
stole my stockings.

151
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,674
Excuse me.

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,592
I'm sure...
Hey, engineer!

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,432
- Good morning, Laura.
- Good morning, why are you here?

154
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,477
- Have you come to see me?
- Yes, that's it.

155
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,029
I met this man on the stairs
and let him in. I thought...

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,191
- You could've told me.
- Well, no big deal.

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,316
It doesn't matter.
I only wanted to ask a favor.

158
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,629
I'll get changed.

159
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,597
You're okay as you are.

160
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,717
You see Marina, don't you?

161
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,074
Yes, after lunch, in the theater.

162
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,629
Please tell her I wont be able
to see her the next few days.

163
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,598
- If I can, I'll phone her.
- Very well. At the theater?

164
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,193
Not at the theater, no.

165
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,396
Bye, nice to meet you.

166
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,388
- Does she live with you?
- She's my sister.

167
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,835
- Oh, your sister.
- You're shocked, huh?

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,434
Who knows how many lies
she's told you?

169
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,113
Who knows where she said she lives?

170
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,159
She's ashamed of us because
she says she's an artist

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,914
and we're just plain workers
but I wouldn't change for her.

172
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,308
I understand.

173
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,471
Not that she's bad, just stupid.

174
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,758
But what do you know
about Laureta?

175
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,875
Sorry, I'm prying.

176
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,794
No, Laureta is a good friend
of a girl I know.

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,518
- Who, Marina?
- Do you know her?

178
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,591
Since she was born.

179
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,830
Her mother was the caretaker
at Tiburtina Street,

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,070
where my dad had
a scrap metal business.

181
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,629
You could say she and Laureta
grew up together.

182
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,315
But, please don't say
anything to Marina

183
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,789
about what I told you,
I beg you.

184
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,757
No, don't fret,
I won't be seeing her again.

185
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,433
- Why not?
- I don't know why,

186
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,036
but I've got a feeling
it's got to end.

187
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,318
- Have you known her long?
- Yeah, about four months.

188
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,516
I'd just come to Rome
and she usually had lunch

189
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,069
in a little trattoria
near the Spanish Steps.

190
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,595
One day a siren went off,
every body ran for it,

191
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,275
and we were left alone.
She laughed, wasn't afraid at all.

192
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,717
- And you fell in love.
- Yeah, it happens.

193
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,552
Yeah, it happens.

194
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,512
But she's not the woman for me.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,151
Maybe if I'd met her
before I lived on Tiburtina.

196
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,909
What's that got to do with it?

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,469
A woman can change,
especially if she's in love.

198
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,392
Who says she's in love?

199
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,391
Why wouldn't she be?

200
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,518
God, I haven't even asked if
you want a coffee. Want one?

201
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,113
- Don't bother.
- Please.

202
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,078
It'll only take a moment.
I'll do it right now.

203
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,409
I call it coffee just to
call it something.

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,319
Careful, Don Pietro.

205
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,353
It's you. What a miracle
seeing you in church.

206
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,476
I've come because
my mother sent me.

207
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,870
She's done well.
It won't do you any harm.

208
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,476
Don. Pietro, let me finish.
You've got come to our house now.

209
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,551
- It's important.
- What is it?

210
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,597
I don't know,
it's a mystery to me

211
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,910
but I think there's someone
in Francesco's place.

212
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,035
Very well, let's go.

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,273
Gilberto!

214
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,038
Listen. Agostino's coming now.

215
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,834
Meanwhile, you're referee.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,991
And above all,
behave yourselves, alright?

217
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,549
Come here.

218
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,831
Why not come to church more often?

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,150
How can one waste time in church
at a time like this?

220
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,673
But, what are you saying?

221
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,558
Maybe you don't understand,

222
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,917
but we've got to close ranks
against the common enemy.

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,877
Tell me who told you
these things.

224
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,679
- Remoleto.
- Remoleto told you.

225
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,229
Don Pietro, please don't
tell anyone.

226
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,832
Here comes 'Purgatory'.

227
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,838
Don Pietro.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,309
- What have you brought.
- I've been shopping.

229
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,994
Have you spent all the coupons?

230
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,149
Not a one.

231
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,673
Why so much bread?

232
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,559
I don't know.
There was some party...

233
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,233
I don't know what party.

234
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,992
Neither did the baker.

235
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,310
Well, I've got to go now.

236
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,119
- What party was that?
- I don't get it.

237
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,236
Let's hope my mother
has found out.

238
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,789
That's it.

239
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,875
It didn't turn out well,
but at least it's hot.

240
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,238
- Drink it quick.
- Thank you.

241
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,152
Francesco tells me
you're getting married.

242
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,108
A belated marriage, you understand,
me in this condition.

243
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,113
We'd set the date ages ago,
but then, for one reason

244
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,874
or another it got delayed.
But this time it's for sure.

245
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,473
- When?
- Tomorrow.

246
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,312
Then I must give you a gift.

247
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,074
For God's sake, ours is
a wartime marriage.

248
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,151
We'll go to Don. Pietro
and that's that.

249
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,309
You're having a church wedding?

250
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,109
Yes. Francesco didn't want to,
but I said:

251
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,919
better if Don Pietro marries us,
who's at least one of us,

252
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,878
instead of a fascist collaborator
in the court, don't you think?

253
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,917
If you put it that way, yes.

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,755
Truth is, I believe in God.

255
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,478
Tell me, what are you
doing now, working?

256
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,428
I was working in the Breda factory,
but they fired us.

257
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,990
The Germans are taking everything.

258
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,958
That'll be Don Pietro. I'll open up.

259
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,758
- Good morning, Don Pietro.
- Good morning.

260
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,476
Well, excuse me. I'm off.

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,270
- Thanks for coming.
- Don't mention it.

262
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,596
- Well, what are you doing?
- Who's there?

263
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,513
Who's there? What do you care?
Go get some water. Move it!

264
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,038
- I've got to talk to you.
- Come in.

265
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,269
There's more than 500
in the mountains at Taglio Cotto.

266
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,749
The group's ready and waiting.
You can't abandon them.

267
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,559
The time's set for 6 this
afternoon on Burgino Bridge.

268
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,678
One of them is coming.
It's better I don't go because

269
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,149
I'm on file and
now the curfew

270
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,151
starts at 5.

271
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,069
- Right. I'll go.
- I knew you would.

272
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,310
- What's the message.
- It's not a message,

273
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,074
it's about a sum of money
from the military command.

274
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,954
Am I asking too much?

275
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,756
No, for what they're sacrificing
it's even too little.

276
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,672
How will I recognize him?

277
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,991
He'll stop on the bridge
and whistle "Morning in Florence".

278
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,798
But of course, you don't know it.

279
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,076
- Well, no. How does it go?
- Like this...

280
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,510
It's common, yes.
Everybody sings it.

281
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,230
- Good day, reverend.
- Good day.

282
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,355
What do you want?

283
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,960
You don't have a San Antonio Abad,
by any chance?

284
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,873
Sorry, we did some time ago,
but they don't sell well.

285
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,072
I can offer you a San Roque.

286
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,072
Thanks, not interested.

287
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,993
Not interested in a saint
like San Roque?

288
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,475
Come with me.

289
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,711
Here it is, it's great work.

290
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,756
Alright, we'll see.

291
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,269
I'm off then, okay?

292
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,908
Yes, don't forget the piece
for Chiuraci.

293
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,354
I'll give you a good price.

294
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,194
I should talk to Francesco.

295
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,590
The man with
the tight shoes sent me.

296
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,279
Wait a moment.

297
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,476
Come in, reverend.
They're waiting for you.

298
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,958
Go down the stairs.

299
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,558
- Ah, you're Don Pietro.
- Hello.

300
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,596
What's happened?

301
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,479
Nothing serious, thank God,
but it could have.

302
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,915
The SS were at
Manfredi's place tonight.

303
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,911
We already know that,
but where is he?

304
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,195
- At your place.
- My place?

305
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,669
Yes, Pina opened up.
He'll stay a few days.

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,797
They gave me this note for you.

307
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,758
I wanted him to got to San Giovanni
and San Paolo with the passionists.

308
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,434
It would've been safer, but he
didn't want to be out of things.

309
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,592
But now it's more dangerous
than working while you're on file.

310
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,389
I know, reverend, but we're few
and if he's in a convent...

311
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,436
I understand.

312
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,875
Excuse me. Don Pietro,
it's our leader.

313
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,519
Pleasure to meet you.

314
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,591
The pleasure's mine.
I've heard a lot about you.

315
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,753
Yes, a shame for
my modesty and my health.

316
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,718
You've done a lot for us.
I'm grateful.

317
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,838
It's my duty to help
those in need. That's it.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,479
Like to come over here?

319
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,113
Here, reverend.

320
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,637
Manfredi had told me
it's about a sum of money.

321
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,189
They're books, but there's
not much to read.

322
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,995
- They're all the same?
- A thousand pages.

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,831
- A million.
- Exactly.

324
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,830
- Who is it?
- Marina. It's me. Open up.

325
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,220
Hi.

326
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:08,418
Guess who I saw this morning.

327
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:11,259
- How should I know?
- Manfredi. He came to see me.

328
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,380
- To see you? Where?
- At my place.

329
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,938
Why did he go to your house?
What did he want?

330
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:18,295
He asked me to tell you
that for a few days

331
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,608
he won't be seeing you
and that he'll phone if he can.

332
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,813
- Nothing else?
- No.

333
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:25,131
He didn't explain?

334
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,330
No. I tell you.
I didn't ask either.

335
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,006
He caught me in my dressing gown
and rollers, imagine.

336
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:33,918
Aren't you going to change?
You're on next.

337
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:41,274
- How did he know where you live?
- How did he know?

338
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:43,034
You must have told him.

339
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,759
I never told him.

340
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:47,387
What do you want me to say?
I didn't tell him.

341
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,355
I don't like people knowing
where I live.

342
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:54,422
By the way, Marina,
I can't stay in that place.

343
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:56,663
If you don't mind,
I'll come and stay at your place

344
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,787
until I find a room.

345
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,417
Sure, whenever you like.
I've told you many times.

346
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:02,816
You're an angel.

347
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,298
- What are you looking for?
- A cigarette.

348
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,691
- I'll get it for you.
- Okay, okay.

349
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,533
Thanks.

350
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,735
- What time did you see him?
- See who?

351
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:18,852
Giorgio.

352
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:22,083
It was really early.
I still wasn't dressed.

353
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:24,244
5 minutes.

354
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,850
I don't get it.
Are you in love with him, or not?

355
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,324
He's friendly, no denying.

356
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:32,842
Do me a favor and
don't get involved.

357
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:34,597
Me? As long as you're happy.

358
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:39,676
- Are you sick?
- It's nothing.

359
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:42,115
Marina, not again?

360
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,747
- You know the harm it does.
- Rubbish.

361
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:48,830
So many things do us harm,
but we still keep doing them.

362
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:51,582
Coming.

363
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,538
- How are you?
- Fine, how about you?

364
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,742
How lovely you are this afternoon.
But you're always so elegant.

365
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:03,974
- Well, I'm off.
- Laureta.

366
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:07,020
Snap out of it, or the director
will be on to you.

367
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:09,410
- Excuse me, I'm on.
- Yes, dear.

368
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,017
- Have you got it?
- Yes.

369
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:13,891
You're wonderful.

370
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,196
He doesn't have a schedule.
He comes and goes, in and out.

371
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:32,320
In these times,

372
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:35,518
when you shouldn't
stick your neck out,

373
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,830
- his is all the way out.
- He's got his reasons.

374
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,249
- Good ones, we trust.
- Agostino, you shock me.

375
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:43,675
Give me a break.

376
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,615
You think I don't know
that little riot at the bakery

377
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:49,315
- was organized by you?
- Me?

378
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:51,414
Yes, you.
You think I'm an fool?

379
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:53,044
I see and hear everything,

380
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:56,612
and I know if you keep up this
fanaticism, anything could happen.

381
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,512
- We hope not.
- We hope.

382
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,610
- Cabbage soup.
- Yes, I can smell it.

383
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,381
What's the time?
Curfew starts at 5.

384
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,333
Let's see.
It 4.30.

385
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:09,225
- Right then, I've gotta go.
- You want to leave a message?

386
00:24:09,392 --> 00:24:11,648
No, I just wanted to talk
to Don Pietro, but never mind.

387
00:24:11,812 --> 00:24:14,102
I'll see him tomorrow,
before the wedding.

388
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:15,614
Here he is at last.

389
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:20,342
- Good afternoon, Don Pietro.
- Good afternoon, Pina.

390
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,897
I've told you a thousand times
not to cook on the heater.

391
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,364
And eating as well.

392
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:30,412
- Whatever you wish,...
- Agostino, don't answer back.

393
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,862
but we have to decide,
light the heater or the stove.

394
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:38,710
Always books. We don't have
money to buy food,

395
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:40,090
and he has to buy books.

396
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,674
Don't touch. I have to take them
to the priest at San Lorenzo.

397
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,964
You're going out again?
But curfew is in 20 minutes.

398
00:24:46,132 --> 00:24:48,829
Doesn't matter. Doctors and
priests can move about.

399
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,173
Midwives, too.

400
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:54,541
I read it; in the dark,
it's easier for women

401
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,248
to get pregnant.
With so much crime about.

402
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:59,929
Don Pietro, I came for confession.

403
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:03,660
How can we do that?
I've got to go now.

404
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:07,074
All right, I'll come with you.
We can do it on the way.

405
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,419
- Give me the package. I'll take it.
- No, no.

406
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:10,923
A priest carrying a package?

407
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,417
Don't make me laugh.
It's light as a feather.

408
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:18,101
Come on, it's getting late.
Hurry, come with me.

409
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:20,403
- See you tomorrow, Agostino.
- And relax, okay?

410
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:22,986
If this war isn't over soon,
I'll go crazy.

411
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,115
- Are you the priest?
- Yes.

412
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:43,020
- Don Pietro Pelegrini?
- Yes.

413
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:44,733
I'd like to talk to you.

414
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,265
Wait a moment.

415
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,429
- I'll go then.
- Yes.

416
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:58,142
Well, you'd better...

417
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,587
- wait for me over there.
- Yes, alright.

418
00:26:15,722 --> 00:26:16,782
Go in.

419
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:19,926
Go outside a moment.

420
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:23,726
Please.

421
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:27,184
As you please.

422
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:47,976
From Don Severio de Visita,

423
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:50,755
the priest for Nottuno.

424
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:06,427
Don't think I'm a coward,

425
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,843
but I can't take any more.

426
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,853
Don't let it get you down,
I'll try to help her.

427
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,791
Where are you from?

428
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:24,640
From Casino. It's hell.

429
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,948
What did that man want?
Leave it. Who was he?

430
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:37,924
Someone wanting information.

431
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,636
When I see one of them...

432
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,308
It's been so long since I confessed
I'm almost ashamed.

433
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:47,287
- No.
- Let me speak.

434
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:49,353
I know I've live badly,

435
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,650
done so many things
I shouldn't have.

436
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:56,138
But you think I'm ashamed to go
to the altar in this state.

437
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,956
But you can't understand,
Don Pietro.

438
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,410
There are things you do
without thinking,

439
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,633
without the impression
you're doing anything wrong.

440
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:07,006
I was so in love
and he is so good,

441
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:08,516
so brave.

442
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,398
I've often thought he could
find someone better than me.

443
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,290
Yes, a younger woman,

444
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:17,497
and not a widow with a boy almost
grown and no means of support

445
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:20,017
because I've had to sell
it all to survive,

446
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:23,186
to just keep going
and it's worse every day.

447
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:27,163
Who'll help us forget
all this suffering,

448
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,560
this anxiety and fear?

449
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:32,769
Maybe Christ doesn't see us.

450
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:37,180
So many have asked me that, Pina.

451
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,672
Christ doesn't see us?

452
00:28:39,155 --> 00:28:42,074
But are we sure we don't
deserve this punishment?

453
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:46,131
Are we so certain we've always
lived according to God's laws?

454
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:50,256
First one only thinks of
changing life, improving things.

455
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:53,707
Later, when things don't go so well,
one becomes desperate and asks:

456
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:56,916
Maybe God isn't watching?
Maybe He has no mercy on us?

457
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:00,075
Yes, God has mercy on us,

458
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:03,447
but we have so many things
to forgive,

459
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,740
so must know how to pray
and forgive others.

460
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:10,222
You're right, but how?
Because, when..

461
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:14,111
I see someone like those over there
I want to jab them in the face.

462
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:17,042
Sure, you're right...
But, what things you make me say!

463
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,205
Give me the package,
I can't allow myself this now.

464
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,256
- Good afternoon, Pina.
- Good afternoon, Don Pietro.

465
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,312
I wanted a connection.

466
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:02,201
The Germans had taken her
boyfriend to the station.

467
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:04,643
I'll take care of her,
I told him.

468
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,804
She had a pair of tits on her.

469
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:10,212
Halt! Hands up!

470
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:12,828
Got your pass?

471
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:16,753
Printer.

472
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:20,405
- Printer?
- Yes, check my papers.

473
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:24,457
- Alright. Go home, and fast.
- Thank you.

474
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,486
Goodnight, captain.
Thank you.

475
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,754
Don't forget, I'll pick you up
tomorrow. Sleep tight.

476
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:04,105
Francesco, you frightened me.

477
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,501
I'm a bit late because
he insisted on taking me home.

478
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,636
Nothing bad happened, okay?

479
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,281
Hey, Francesco!

480
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:19,537
- Everything went well, eh?
- This time, yes.

481
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,839
The boss and old Nanina
were magnificent.

482
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,251
Know who came back this morning
and searched the house?

483
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:26,669
They wasted their time.
There was nothing.

484
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,811
Don Pietro told me
Pina opened up.

485
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:31,269
- Yes, she's been very kind.
- What do you think?

486
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:32,764
You're doing well marrying her.

487
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:36,261
At first, she took me for a cop
and treated me very badly.

488
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:37,429
I can imagine.

489
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:40,783
- Know Don Pietro has met Gino?
- Yeah? I'm glad.

490
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:43,192
- Has he told you about my business?
- He's worried.

491
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:44,933
He had to meet up with
the Old Man.

492
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:46,139
When did he arrive?

493
00:31:46,306 --> 00:31:48,231
Last night,
but you mustn't see him.

494
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:51,943
Gino said you have to break contact
with the center for a while.

495
00:31:52,674 --> 00:31:55,688
He's right, but there's too much
work to just hang around.

496
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:58,104
I don't understand how they
fished me out.

497
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,648
I've got to find out
what they really know about me.

498
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:05,446
We'll try, but it's hard to get
information from the police station.

499
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,718
We're hoping Don Pietro's met up
with our friend from Italia Corsi.

500
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:11,210
We hope so.

501
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:17,172
I brought you the paper.

502
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,118
It's come out well, hasn't it?

503
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,544
- How many copies?
- 12,000.

504
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:28,332
That'll be Pina.

505
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,733
Hi, how are you?

506
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,069
- I'm worried about Marcello.
- What's he done?

507
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:37,601
- Gone missing.
- Missing?

508
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,580
Yes. I've looked all over
the building and he's not here.

509
00:32:39,744 --> 00:32:41,554
- He'll be with Remoleto.
- No way, he's not upstairs.

510
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,529
And Otelo, the son of the Sicilian,
Mrs. Tergel,

511
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:44,610
isn't upstairs either.

512
00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:47,268
- What have they gotten into?
- I'm afraid that they've gone out.

513
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:49,172
At this hour, with the curfew?

514
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,535
Bravo! I'm proud of you all.

515
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,643
Hurry up, guys.

516
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:36,237
Let's wait for the others.

517
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,061
- Good night.
- Bye.

518
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,439
I'll kill you.
Where have you been?

519
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,594
If I had a father like that...

520
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:09,970
Your mother's son!
What time is this to come home?

521
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,725
We'd better go in one by one.

522
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:22,467
You're right. You go first.

523
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:24,957
Here you are, you rascals.
They're back.

524
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,225
Little rogues.

525
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:29,918
You'll be the death of me!

526
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:33,983
I'll go and see what
Marcello has to say.

527
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,127
- Look how they've come home.
- Where have you been?

528
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,977
- With Remoleto.
- Not true. Nobody was upstairs.

529
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:39,912
- We were below.
- Below where?

530
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,811
I'm going to kill them.

531
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,567
Little bastards.

532
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,333
Calm down.

533
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,750
I can't take any more.
They driving me mad.

534
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,613
They're just boys.

535
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:55,834
Shut up for once. Can't anyone
get some peace in this damn house.

536
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,450
I work all day.

537
00:34:57,586 --> 00:34:59,468
- Yeah, some job.
- What did you say?

538
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:01,128
Speak up, speak your mind.

539
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,013
- Better you went to bed.
- Why?

540
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:04,702
Can't I speak in my own house?

541
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,390
This is my house, and if you want
to talk, do it in your room.

542
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:07,848
I pay for the kitchen too.

543
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:09,127
Shut up, Laureta.

544
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:10,986
I'm sick of living among workers.

545
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,334
Then get out, who's stopping you?

546
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:14,357
How come you're always fighting?

547
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:15,442
This is the last time, I assure you.

548
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,289
If she doesn't go,
one day or another...

549
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:22,329
Sister, the oven.

550
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:25,839
The Holy Virgin! It'll have burnt.
All because of that hysterical...

551
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:27,296
Come here.

552
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,144
It's a surprise. My sister

553
00:35:31,348 --> 00:35:33,873
is baking a cake for tomorrow,

554
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,427
for the wedding.

555
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,504
You're not...
going to argue at the last moment?

556
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:39,409
No.

557
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:42,049
Because we're going to put on
a big spread.

558
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:46,397
- Grandad is happy.
- Let's go to bed.

559
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,528
- Good night.
- Turn out the light, please.

560
00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:55,115
- We did well, didn't we?
- Yes, but you never take me.

561
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,239
- Sure, because you're a woman.
- And women...

562
00:35:57,379 --> 00:35:58,829
can't be brave?

563
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,928
Yeah, sure they can,
but Remoleto says women

564
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:04,695
always bring problems.

565
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,115
He's caught us.

566
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,194
Can't you sleep?

567
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,313
Not yet.

568
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,670
Where did your friend
Remoleto take you all?

569
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,478
I can't say.

570
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,114
Not even to me?

571
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,675
No, it's a secret.

572
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,990
Then you're right
not to tell anyone.

573
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,228
Good night.

574
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,750
Hey.

575
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,309
What's up?

576
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,593
Is it true that from tomorrow
I can call you Dad?

577
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,836
- If you like.
- Yeah, I love you.

578
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,269
What's the matter?

579
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,036
I had a fight with my sister.

580
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,078
- Again?
- She wants to leave.

581
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,115
She said she's not even
coming to our wedding.

582
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,910
It's just things people say.

583
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,152
No, she was serious.
She's packing her bags.

584
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,437
She'll change her mind tomorrow.

585
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,360
- I'm tired.
- Don't cry.

586
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,112
I'm so tired.

587
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,555
Come on, let's go inside.

588
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,392
Giorgio's in there, I don't want to.

589
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,232
What does it matter? He's a friend.

590
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,516
I know, but I've wanted
to talk to you for some time.

591
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,749
What about?

592
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,912
Come, let's sit on the stairs.

593
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,069
Like when we first talked,
remember?

594
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,199
Sure I do. You had the nerve to
bang on my door in such a rage.

595
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,989
No wonder. You'd decided to
hammer some nails...

596
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,232
and knocked down my mirror,
though it didn't break.

597
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,078
"Who do you think you are,
King of the Universe?

598
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,397
I didn't like you at all.

599
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,073
You were living here 2 months

600
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,390
and when we passed each other
you never said hello.

601
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,318
2 years have gone by.

602
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,395
How far it seems,
how different everything is.

603
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,028
- Though we were already at war.
- Yes.

604
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,348
Everybody thought
it was going to end soon,

605
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,115
and then we'd just
watch it at the movies.

606
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,829
- Instead...
- When will it be over?

607
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,033
There are times when
I can't take any more.

608
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,954
It seems like we'll never
get out of this hell.

609
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,952
It'll be over, Pina,

610
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,512
and spring will come back,

611
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,832
and it'll be even more beautiful
because we'll be free.

612
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,393
We have to believe in it.
We have to really want it.

613
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,394
You'll see. I know these things,

614
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,790
I feel them, but I don't know
how to explain them to you.

615
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,632
Giorgio knows how to get it done.

616
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,678
He's a skilled man. He's studied
and traveled a lot.

617
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,432
He knows how to speak well.

618
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,397
But I believe it's like that.

619
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,752
We mustn't be scared of
today or tomorrow

620
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,876
because we're on the right path,

621
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,749
- we're in the right, understand?
- Yes, Francesco.

622
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,995
We're fighting for something
that has to come,

623
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,992
that's impossible not to come.

624
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,314
Maybe the road is long and hard,

625
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,155
but we'll get there
and we'll see a better world.

626
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,035
And above all,
our children will know it,

627
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,557
Marcello and him,
the one we're waiting on.

628
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,792
So, you mustn't be afraid,
ever, Pina,

629
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,359
whatever happens.

630
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,159
- You promise?
- Yes, Francesco,

631
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,958
but I've never been afraid, ever.

632
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,189
Hello?
Oh, it's you, ma'am.

633
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,475
We haven't seen him.

634
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,713
But he hasn't phoned,
or sent anyone?

635
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,674
Nanina, tell me the truth.
Do you know anything?

636
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:18,709
I don't know ma'am, I swear.
If I did, I'd tell you.

637
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,439
We hope not.

638
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,468
Good night.

639
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,200
That girl's a fool
asking for news over the phone.

640
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,237
She wants to turn us all in
to the cops.

641
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,839
Come in.

642
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,517
- Chief of Roman Police, sir.
- Show him in.

643
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,628
Dear friend,
a great moment has come.

644
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,312
I have very interesting information.

645
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,758
Our Manfredi has been seen
this morning in the Predestino area.

646
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,148
- Please.
- Thank you.

647
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,073
And a short time ago
a device exploded

648
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,037
in a carriage full of gasoline

649
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,668
at the rail crossing in the zone.

650
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,910
Excuse me, Major, but my news

651
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,275
is much more extraordinary
than yours.

652
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,238
I've spent most of the afternoon
in the central barracks,

653
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,712
and I too have made
an interesting discovery.

654
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,632
Great.

655
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,032
"Ferraris, Luigi. Born, Turin,

656
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,270
Oct. 3, 1906,

657
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,715
detained in Poland Feb. 4, 1928.

658
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,072
Sentenced to 12 years
for conspiracy

659
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,310
against the statutory
powers of the State,

660
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,314
escaped during transfer.
On file in Paris and Marseille."

661
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,316
Luigi Ferraris!

662
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,519
You've beaten me.

663
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,398
I'd never allow it, sir.

664
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,155
There's still the most
important task, to catch him.

665
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,993
Don't you doubt it.
He won't escape from me.

666
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,469
- Want me to take care of it?
- No, I forbid it.

667
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,959
That is to say,

668
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,479
it's not that I don't trust your
methods, but I prefer mine.

669
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,159
Excuse me.

670
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,875
Ingrid?

671
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,873
- Good afternoon. How are you?
- Dear madam.

672
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,156
Thank you for the flowers
and the coffee.

673
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,676
You corrupt my people,

674
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,432
but I forgive you.

675
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,273
He has just made
a very interesting discovery.

676
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,395
Really?

677
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,996
Enough of words.

678
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,991
Time to act.

679
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,479
Let me do it.

680
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,438
Good morning.

681
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,352
Good morning, boys.

682
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,798
Praise be to God.

683
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,598
May He be praised always.

684
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,952
Praise be to Jesus Christ.

685
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,033
May He be praised always,

686
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,430
but you're always
the last to praise Him.

687
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,711
- Who is it?
- The law.

688
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,194
Morning, officer.

689
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,915
Wait a moment.
I'm getting dressed.

690
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,834
Then meanwhile, with your permission
we'll congratulate your future wife.

691
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,754
Francesco!

692
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,752
Francesco, look!

693
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,431
- Sergeant...
- Sir...

694
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,076
- Interrogate those men.
- Yes, sir.

695
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,399
They're surrounding the house.
Don't show your face.

696
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,472
You, over there.

697
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,393
Get them out of their houses
and bring them to the square.

698
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,118
You, the same on the other side.

699
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,774
Marcello!

700
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,173
- What's up, Andreina?
- The Germans and the Fascists!

701
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,739
- Where?
- Our place.

702
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,174
Come on, guys.

703
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,739
Steady on. Wait a moment.

704
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,413
The Germans, don't you understand?

705
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,730
Don't move. I'll go
and see what's happening.

706
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,539
- We have to go.
- I said stay here, understand?

707
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,975
Don Pietro, we've got
some bombs in the attic.

708
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,179
Hurry, don't hang about.

709
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,457
The Germans are here.
Francesco's gone to Tulio's to

710
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,850
get rid of some documents.
Don't worry, he'll take care of it.

711
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,409
- Don't say anything to Pina.
- Don't worry, I won't.

712
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,850
- What are you doing here?
- Getting my washing.

713
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,171
Get out, nobody'll touch it.
That's why we're here.

714
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,410
How silly of me.
I had no idea.

715
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,660
Come on, hurry up.
Get yourself over there.

716
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,249
- And Francesco, where is he?
- He's safe.

717
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,657
Look, those scum are
taking out the sick, too.

718
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,697
Can't you walk any faster?

719
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,133
My grandad won't come down.
Don't hurt him.

720
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,939
Don't worry. Go over there.
Quick, quick.

721
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,055
Oh, my God, my son!

722
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,212
Why have they taken him?

723
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,936
- Where has he hidden?
- Upstairs.

724
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,809
It's all my fault.
I'll never forgive myself.

725
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,932
Impossible!
In such a big building, not one man.

726
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,011
Where are the men who live here?

727
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,772
Didn't you hear?
Where are the men?

728
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,090
What do I know?
I'm not the caretaker.

729
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,251
Halt! What's a priest doing here?

730
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,409
What does he want?

731
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,416
Where are you going?

732
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,774
A sick man needs comfort.

733
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,134
He's the local priest. Don't worry,

734
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,293
we've taken him out
for a little air.

735
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,293
Impossible, a man so ill.
I have to go up.

736
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,290
Hold it.

737
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,018
Are these visiting hours, reverend?

738
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,694
The poor man hasn't stopped calling.
He'll be dead by now.

739
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,533
Hold on, what's the story?
They've brought everyone down.

740
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,736
Not this one.
He's an old paralytic,

741
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,333
go up, reverend, and make it quick.

742
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,972
What service! Once we called
the fire department and...

743
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,449
Remoleto!

744
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,249
Remoleto, open up. It's me.
I've come with Don Pietro.

745
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,899
Get out of here, go!

746
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,818
Open up, Remoleto.

747
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,414
If you don't, you'll get blown
sky high with me!

748
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,219
Open up, I tell you.

749
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,810
What are you doing?

750
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,254
Nothing. I'm going to kill them all.

751
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,650
You want to cause a massacre?

752
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,139
Give me that.

753
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,890
Help!

754
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,016
Help!
Let me go!

755
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,374
Let me go!

756
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,008
What floor is this dying man on?

757
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,330
I don't know, the 3rd, the 4th...

758
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,049
I'm going up,
I've got medical knowledge.

759
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,334
I'll go with you.

760
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,934
No, I'll go alone.
I don't like a mob.

761
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,055
No one here.
Let's look on the floor above.

762
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,533
The door, the door.

763
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,173
What are you doing here?

764
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,370
I'm alright.

765
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,939
I'm alright.

766
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,056
I don't need you now.

767
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,336
I've decided to live
another 100 years.

768
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,252
- They're coming.
- Who's coming.

769
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,251
- Who's coming?
- The Germans.

770
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,969
I laugh in the face of
the Germans and Fascists.

771
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,529
Give me that.

772
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,248
Look over there.

773
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,215
Come on, grandad.

774
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,249
Give me

775
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,412
Come back, wake up.

776
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,099
Don Pietro, you really
gave him a good one!

777
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,411
You're very pretty!

778
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,374
Francesco!

779
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,729
Pina!

780
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,809
Let me go, you bastard.

781
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,495
Mom!

782
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,094
Answer him.

783
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,698
Wait for my signal.

784
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,098
- Flavio?
- What's up?

785
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,488
We've brought you some meat.

786
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,372
- Where is it?
- Here.

787
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,849
And what do I do with this?

788
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,329
I'm an inn-keeper,
not a butcher.

789
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,853
We're butchers.

790
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,779
Yes, I know, you're specialists.

791
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,809
Ah, Engineer.

792
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,574
Good evening, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

793
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,530
Good evening, Engineer.
The lady's waiting for you.

794
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,689
Come on.

795
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,612
Giorgio, at last.

796
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,453
I've look everywhere for you.
I was sure you'd come here.

797
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,531
- But, what's happened?
- Nothing. Why?

798
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,737
Should something have happened?

799
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,255
- I don't understand, sorry.
- But, because of your house...

800
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,775
May I? A friend of mine.
Sit down, Francesco.

801
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,858
Pleasure to meet you, Marina.

802
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,900
- The SS came, didn't they?
- Who told you?

803
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,857
The caretaker.
What were they looking for?

804
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,851
I don't know.
Because I'm an officer.

805
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:52,975
Where are you going to sleep?

806
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,290
I don't know. We'll go
to a friend's house tonight.

807
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,337
- Why not come to my place?
- No, not your place.

808
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,296
Why not?

809
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,735
I don't want to bother you.
Also, I'm with him.

810
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,368
You can stay in the living room
and sleep on the sofa.

811
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,059
You'll be fine.

812
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,290
- Spaghetti for everyone?
- Well, we'll talk about it.

813
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,974
- Tickets, please.
- I don't have any.

814
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,017
- I'll give you some of mine.
- Thank you.

815
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,289
For second course?

816
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,257
Go to the kitchen.
I'll attend to them.

817
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,249
- They've detained Meseti.
- When?

818
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,411
This morning at 6.
The painter told me.

819
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,094
If we don't lay low for a while,
everyone'll be hunting for us.

820
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,090
- Flavio?
- Yes?

821
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,091
Was it his place
you wanted to sleep?

822
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,012
Someone talked.

823
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,333
Poor animals.

824
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,534
There's an American station
on at this time

825
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,974
that broadcasts jazz.

826
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,050
Shall we have a drink, boys?

827
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,409
I was given a bottle of Chianti.

828
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,459
This will warm us up a bit.

829
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,489
Thanks.

830
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,379
Do you feel ill?

831
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,538
He's got a fever.
Giorgio, he's burning up.

832
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,134
- I'll get the bed ready.
- Don't bother.

833
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,338
Cheer up, Francesco.

834
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,218
Help me, Giorgio.

835
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,171
He'll be very comfortable.

836
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,970
When he goes to bed,
I'll give him a pill for the fever.

837
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,336
Please, hand me that blanket.

838
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:55,132
You've got to be careful.
There's a flu about.

839
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,258
These days, it's the only
thing that goes round.

840
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,258
Who's that at this hour?

841
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,736
Who is it?

842
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,209
- It's me, Laureta.
- Oh, it's you.

843
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,213
Hi, darling.
See? I'm here at last.

844
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,450
I finally decided to break free,
but I told her...

845
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,134
- You're drunk.
- Yes, just a bit.

846
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,372
Then go to bed.

847
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,816
Who's here? Is anyone here?

848
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,372
The engineer.

849
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,818
Go to bed, Laureta.

850
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,978
I'm not going to eat him.

851
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,256
Francesco. What are you doing here?

852
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,016
Pina thrown you out
on the first night?

853
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,772
I think Marina's right.

854
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,658
Take her to bed.

855
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,970
- Come on.
- What a welcome.

856
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,377
I'd have preferred stay with Fritz.
I'll tell Pina when I see her.

857
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,209
Go to bed, you've got a fever.
I'll get a pill.

858
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,618
I fought with my sister.
I won't go back home.

859
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,008
- Marina.
- Come in.

860
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,818
Don't look at me, Engineer.

861
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,808
Where are the pills?

862
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,619
Look in that drawer.
There should be a pill box.

863
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,811
That fool's all we needed.

864
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,734
And now, what do we do?
Where are you going to sleep?

865
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,653
I'll make do in the lounge,
in the armchair.

866
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,650
You'll be uncomfortable
and cold. How infuriating!

867
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,134
Hello?

868
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,818
It's you. Good evening.

869
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,174
How are you, darling?

870
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,616
I was waiting for your call.

871
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,459
Why's that? You not alone?

872
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,053
You see?

873
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,289
Is he there?

874
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,417
Oh, little Laureta.

875
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,174
Yes, she's come to stay
with me a few days.

876
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,490
No.

877
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,898
No. Yeah, sure.

878
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,055
Very well.

879
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,497
We'll call each other tomorrow.

880
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,299
Good night.

881
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,172
Why do you have morphine
in your handbag?

882
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,090
What?

883
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,009
Oh, yes.

884
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,570
It's from the dentist, when that
tooth hurt me so much, remember?

885
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,934
No, I don't remember.

886
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,056
Sure you do.
This one here.

887
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,212
I applied it to relieve the pain.

888
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,292
- And it still hurts?
- Not for some time.

889
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,290
But to be sure,
you always carry it.

890
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,610
I wanted to return it
to the dentist.

891
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,978
That explains it.

892
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,529
What are you doing?

893
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,611
Keeping it. I'll go with you
to the dentist.

894
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,418
Give it to me.

895
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,975
Here.

896
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,379
You could lose it
and it's so expensive.

897
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,296
Why do you look at me like that?
Giorgio, you don't think...?

898
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,973
I don't think anything.

899
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,210
You're free to do
what you want with your life.

900
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,655
I've got no rights over you.
Who am I?

901
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,414
Someone who passed a moment
in your life.

902
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,889
- You mean one of many.
- I didn't say that.

903
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,978
No, but you thought it.

904
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,893
Sure, I've had lovers.

905
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,539
What did you want me to do?

906
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,419
How do you think I bought
this furniture,

907
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,572
my clothes, everything?
On my salary?

908
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,017
That's just for
stockings and cigarettes.

909
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,575
I've had to wake up,
like everybody else.

910
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,617
- That's life.
- Life's what we want to make it.

911
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,090
Words.
Life is dirty, filthy.

912
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,012
I know misery
and it scares me.

913
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,818
If I hadn't done
what I've done,

914
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,416
now I'd be married to
a tram driver and hungry,

915
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,696
my children and me.

916
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,299
Poor Marina.

917
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,736
Do you think happiness is
a fancy house,

918
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,778
pretty clothes
and rich lovers?

919
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,408
I would've changed
if you'd really loved me,

920
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,298
but you're like the rest,

921
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,657
worse even. At least they
didn't preach at me.

922
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,133
You're right. I'm sorry.

923
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,888
Giorgio!

924
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,412
Arguing again so as not to
break the habit.

925
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,856
You were eavesdropping,
naturally.

926
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,739
Of course not, but I heard.

927
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,999
You hear everything here.

928
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,638
Tomorrow we'll go to Don Pietro.

929
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,916
He's offered to hide me
in the convent for a while.

930
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,595
- We'll go together.
- No, not me. I can't.

931
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,233
I've got to work now,
more than ever.

932
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,199
She's dead.

933
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,953
I understand.

934
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,237
Look Francesco,
right now

935
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,709
you're desperate.
You might do something rash.

936
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,189
You might do more harm
than good.

937
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,830
Don't be afraid that
the time won't come.

938
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,958
The struggle is long,

939
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,631
and ours has hardly begun.

940
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,998
Here's your pill.

941
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,835
Thank you.

942
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,236
- Good night.
- Good night.

943
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,954
Good night.

944
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,116
- Marina?
- What do you want?

945
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,875
Maybe Manfredi's right,

946
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,792
we are stupid.

947
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,394
Shut up and go to sleep.

948
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,998
A man says he's waiting for you.

949
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,559
Yes, let him in.

950
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,718
Come in, please.

951
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,634
- Morning, Don Pietro.
- Morning, I was waiting for you.

952
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,837
We've done your meat.

953
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,434
"Giovanni Episcovo".
I've taken off 2 years.

954
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,911
Thanks.
Who's that?

955
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,548
The Austrian.
Didn't Francesco tell you?

956
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,517
- That's right.
- He's a good person.

957
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,990
May I? This is the man
who'll come with us.

958
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,149
- A pleasure.
- A pleasure.

959
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,074
I spoke to the prior at the convent.
He's waiting for us.

960
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,152
- And Francesco?
- Outside on the patio with Marcello.

961
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,998
Come, we have to hurry.

962
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,720
Give me...please.

963
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,710
Thank you.

964
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,749
I'll be back late.

965
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,718
When will you stop
getting into trouble?

966
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,230
You and the boy have supper
and go to bed.

967
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,356
I won't be able to sleep.
Oh, Don Pietro.

968
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,350
What do you want?

969
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,556
If I have to feed the boy,
I'll need...

970
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,550
I understand.

971
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,232
- Here. Is that enough?
- But that leaves you nothing.

972
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,709
- No, I've got some.
- Yes, I thought so.

973
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,431
We won't see each other
for a while,

974
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,198
but I'll be back
we'll be together always.

975
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,191
- Let's go, Francesco.
- Coming.

976
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,550
Papa!

977
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,374
You might get cold.
Mom gave it to me.

978
01:06:40,394 --> 01:06:43,179
Hello? Very well.

979
01:06:44,695 --> 01:06:45,804
Yeah.

980
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:51,175
Good.

981
01:06:53,256 --> 01:06:56,948
Your information was correct.
Congratulations.

982
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:27,536
Your information was correct.
Congratulations.

983
01:07:47,372 --> 01:07:49,828
You like it? Try it on.

984
01:07:51,672 --> 01:07:52,894
Do it, darling.

985
01:08:00,473 --> 01:08:02,137
Marvellous.

986
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,088
Look at yourself, Marina.

987
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,215
- Have they arrested him.
- Yes.

988
01:08:13,932 --> 01:08:17,431
- What will they do to him?
- Nothing bad.

989
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:20,460
We need certain information.

990
01:08:20,622 --> 01:08:23,078
As soon as he talks,
we'll let him go free.

991
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:25,429
- And if he won't?
- Nonsense.

992
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,737
Don't worry, he'll talk.

993
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:30,688
And if he doesn't?

994
01:08:30,855 --> 01:08:32,599
Why wouldn't he talk?

995
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,147
Sure, why not?

996
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,488
- Do you love him?
- Me?

997
01:08:41,249 --> 01:08:43,117
I don't love anybody.

998
01:08:49,929 --> 01:08:52,477
Why are you so evasive
with me tonight?

999
01:08:52,637 --> 01:08:53,905
Let me go.

1000
01:08:54,071 --> 01:08:56,811
No, you're staying
with me tonight.

1001
01:08:58,172 --> 01:09:00,799
No, I don't want to.
I don't want any more. Let me go.

1002
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,620
But Marina, why?

1003
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:07,526
What have I done?

1004
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:09,916
What have I done?

1005
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:17,473
Number, please.

1006
01:09:19,317 --> 01:09:20,347
Number four.

1007
01:09:22,144 --> 01:09:23,932
Thank you.
Go on!

1008
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,871
Let's go!

1009
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:40,018
Halt!

1010
01:09:44,443 --> 01:09:45,789
Get in there!

1011
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:49,458
Did they hurt you, Don Pietro?

1012
01:09:50,456 --> 01:09:53,876
- No. And my glasses?
- They're broken.

1013
01:09:57,703 --> 01:09:59,129
Patience.

1014
01:10:04,592 --> 01:10:05,576
Thank you.

1015
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:08,805
It's my fault.
They must have followed me.

1016
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,801
I'd say the opposite.

1017
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,103
I think they've been
spying on me for some time.

1018
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:16,773
You didn't have to come with me.

1019
01:10:16,936 --> 01:10:19,314
Quiet. The walls have ears.

1020
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:22,112
So what, for what
we have to say?

1021
01:10:23,228 --> 01:10:24,541
Isn't that right, Don Pietro?

1022
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:27,645
Yes. We've nothing to say.

1023
01:10:30,595 --> 01:10:31,941
Did you hear them?

1024
01:10:32,108 --> 01:10:34,564
That's us, too.
We'll be screaming like that.

1025
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:38,597
Stay calm.

1026
01:10:40,072 --> 01:10:43,016
We found this
in the priest's bedroom.

1027
01:10:43,775 --> 01:10:45,801
And these are
the prisioners' documents.

1028
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:47,391
Forged, of course.

1029
01:10:47,558 --> 01:10:50,536
- Did you search the sacristy?
- Yes, top to bottom.

1030
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,968
- Did you seen anyone?
- No, Major.

1031
01:10:53,133 --> 01:10:56,111
Only the sexton and a boy,
but they were terrified.

1032
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,539
I'm sure they wouldn't dare talk.

1033
01:10:59,703 --> 01:11:02,330
You're wrong, they will talk.

1034
01:11:05,915 --> 01:11:07,579
- Take all this away.
- Yes, Major.

1035
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:15,867
You're not afraid?

1036
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:17,375
Yes, very,

1037
01:11:17,543 --> 01:11:20,566
but at the same time, calm.
It's strange, isn't it?

1038
01:11:20,728 --> 01:11:22,234
I don't know why that is.

1039
01:11:24,431 --> 01:11:26,854
You're all crazy.

1040
01:11:28,254 --> 01:11:29,964
Listen, I know,

1041
01:11:30,365 --> 01:11:33,025
I know you've got
something to hide.

1042
01:11:33,351 --> 01:11:36,216
Human lives depend on your silence.

1043
01:11:36,935 --> 01:11:40,117
You think your able to
resist their torture.

1044
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,712
You don't know it, but

1045
01:11:41,992 --> 01:11:44,890
they turn the bravest men
into cowards.

1046
01:11:45,058 --> 01:11:46,530
We're not heroes,

1047
01:11:46,691 --> 01:11:50,790
but no one's going to find out
anything, I can tell you that.

1048
01:11:51,031 --> 01:11:53,658
- What's the time?
- Half past eight.

1049
01:11:56,009 --> 01:11:57,831
We've got to make them talk

1050
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,584
before curfew ends

1051
01:11:59,752 --> 01:12:02,334
and the subversives find out
that we caught them.

1052
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,878
We've got ten hours.

1053
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,399
- Kramer.
- Major.

1054
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,118
Turn off the lights.

1055
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,435
Come in.

1056
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,515
Please.

1057
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,468
What's your name?

1058
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,513
Giovanni Episcovo.

1059
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,716
Right.

1060
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,596
Episcovo, born in Bari,
salesman.

1061
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,990
- Selling what?
- Oil and wine.

1062
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,351
Oil and wine.

1063
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,478
Well, Mr. Episcovo,
if I could spend the time,

1064
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:03,838
I'd enjoy very much
talking about your business,

1065
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,037
but I'm in a hurry,
and so, with all due respect,

1066
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,236
allow me to offer you a proposition.

1067
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,679
I know all about you,

1068
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,957
your real name and your
past political activity.

1069
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,198
As for the present,
I know from my informers

1070
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,397
that you're one of the main
heads of the military command

1071
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,438
of the National Committee,

1072
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,115
and you're in with
the Bradogliano military core.

1073
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,078
I have the overriding need
to know all the details

1074
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,879
of this organization
and you are just the man

1075
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,439
to give it to me.

1076
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,352
You said you know who I am,

1077
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,353
you know of my activities,
past and present.

1078
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,390
Then why offer me a proposition?

1079
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,279
Why do you think you can
turn me into a spy?

1080
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,159
I know that in this office
there have the same propositions

1081
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,392
to various Italian generals,

1082
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,712
the Bradoglianos, as you call them,
who have given their lives

1083
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,836
for their silence,

1084
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,630
and I will not betray them.
I hope.

1085
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:07,475
I do regret to see such a
reasonable offer rejected,

1086
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,396
but I'll tell you what I expect.

1087
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,754
The Italians, whatever party
they are in,

1088
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,638
are full of rhetoric.

1089
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,992
I'm sure that before dawn
we'll come to some agreement.

1090
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,794
Cigarette?

1091
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,512
Come on, it won't be
a cigarette that makes you talk.

1092
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,756
They say so many strange things
about the Gestapo.

1093
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,478
Come in.

1094
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,469
You!

1095
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,037
Stay calm, my son.

1096
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,632
Try to pray.

1097
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,832
We found this material
in your bedroom.

1098
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,150
Right.

1099
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,232
It's evident that your aim

1100
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,960
was to attack the Reich
and it's armed forces.

1101
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,875
My aim was not exactly that.

1102
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,393
What would you call a man

1103
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,755
who not only supplied
false documents

1104
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,434
and hid Italians preparing attacks

1105
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,999
on our soldiers,

1106
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,869
but also gave asylum
and aid to German deserters?

1107
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,237
A man who despite everything
tries to exercise charity.

1108
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,755
A loathsome traitor
who ought to be punished

1109
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,514
according to the laws of war
of the Reich.

1110
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,873
It will be as God wishes.

1111
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,951
Then listen to me carefully:

1112
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,110
Your friend Episcovo
is one of the heads

1113
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,998
of a military organization

1114
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,072
of which you, too,
are well aware.

1115
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,312
If you manage to
convince your friend

1116
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,835
to talk as well,

1117
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,639
you'll have fulfilled your duty
as a priest and citizen.

1118
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,513
I'll explain why;

1119
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,672
the men who prepare these
attacks and acts of sabotage

1120
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,274
against the German armed forces

1121
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,113
are violating the rights
of an occupying power,

1122
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,919
guaranteed by
international treaties.

1123
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,196
They are mere snipers

1124
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,591
and therefore must be
brought to justice, is that clear?

1125
01:17:03,592 --> 01:17:05,116
Your words impress me deeply.

1126
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,508
At last you understand.

1127
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,353
- Kramer.
- Yes, Major.

1128
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,192
Take down his statement.

1129
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,188
- Yes, but there's a problem.
- What?

1130
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,477
I personally have nothing to say,
because I don't know anything,

1131
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,915
and the little I do know,
I heard at confession

1132
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,470
and those secrets must die with me.
It's part of our discipline.

1133
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,676
I'm not interested in
your discipline.

1134
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,233
But someone above you and I
is interested.

1135
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,868
Then convince your friend to talk.

1136
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,838
I don't think he knows
anything that you suspect.

1137
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,788
Do you want me to believe you know
nothing of his real activity,

1138
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,235
his real identity?

1139
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,919
I only know that he's a man

1140
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,275
that needed my modest help.

1141
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,829
I'll tell you now who this man is:

1142
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:53,356
a subversive, an atheist!

1143
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,790
I'm a Catholic priest

1144
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,192
and I believe that whoever
fights for justice and freedom,

1145
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,157
walks the path of the Lord,

1146
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,471
and the paths of the Lord
are infinite.

1147
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,029
Not thinking of giving me
a sermon, I suppose.

1148
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,678
It's not my intention.

1149
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,868
Listen, I don't have
time to waste.

1150
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,957
Have you decided to talk?

1151
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,513
Can't you at least
try to convince

1152
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,999
your companion?

1153
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,513
I'm talking about
avoiding a suffering

1154
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,148
that you can't even imagine.

1155
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,995
I imagine better
than you think,

1156
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,113
but I think it would be futile,

1157
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,273
and if this man is who you say,
it'll be hard to get him to talk,

1158
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,759
don't you think?

1159
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,230
Don't you worry, he'll talk.

1160
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,597
- I don't think he will talk.
- You believe so?

1161
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,273
He won't talk.

1162
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,472
I will pray for him.

1163
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,792
You won't get anything
asking your Eternal Father.

1164
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,195
This will take a while.
I'll be in the officer's room.

1165
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,555
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, Major.

1166
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,710
Come in.

1167
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,909
Major, the traitors have been hung.

1168
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,434
Idiot!

1169
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,197
- Who's winning.
- Guess who, for a change.

1170
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,116
Got much work tonight?

1171
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,552
Not much, but interesting.

1172
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,278
Really? Concerning what?

1173
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,113
I've nabbed a man who
has to talk before morning.

1174
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,037
And an Italian priest
who claims he won't talk

1175
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,519
because he'll pray for him.

1176
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,398
- And if he doesn't talk?
- Nonsense.

1177
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,073
But if he keeps quiet?

1178
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,236
If he keeps quiet,

1179
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,675
it would mean an Italian
is equal to a German,

1180
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,748
and there's no difference

1181
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,799
between the blood of an inferior
and a superior race.

1182
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,036
Men are divided in this way.

1183
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,474
25 years ago, I led
firing squads in France.

1184
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,876
I was a young officer then,

1185
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,953
and I thought like you,

1186
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,395
that we belonged to
a superior race,

1187
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,354
but the French preferred us
to execute them

1188
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,953
than tell us anything.

1189
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,315
We'll never understand that
people want to live in freedom.

1190
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,790
- You're drunk, Hartmann.
- Yes, I'm drunk.

1191
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,235
I get drunk
every night to forget,

1192
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,392
and why?
To see things clearly.

1193
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,676
We don't know anything
apart from killing.

1194
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,558
Killing.

1195
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,397
We've covered Europe in corpses.

1196
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,799
And these graves slowly
breed hate,

1197
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,111
hate everywhere.

1198
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:24,468
We'll be annihilated by hate.
There is no hope.

1199
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,390
Shut up.

1200
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,235
We'll all die,
die without hope.

1201
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,755
I forbid you to continue
talking. You are rambling.

1202
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,790
No hope...

1203
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,109
I forbid you...

1204
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,430
Have you forgotten
you are a German officer?

1205
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,913
- Has he talked yet?
- No, Major.

1206
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,514
Wendel says he's never
seen such stubborness.

1207
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,591
He's reached total
insensibility.

1208
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,234
What do we do, Major?

1209
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,992
Well, Wendel?
Practically impossible, Major.

1210
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,276
We have to wait till
he recovers a little.

1211
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,032
Impossible. There's no time.

1212
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,794
Maybe psychological methods,
Major.

1213
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,235
You're mad. He's got to talk.

1214
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,399
The injection.

1215
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,479
Mister Ferraris,

1216
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,551
as I've said,
I have a lot of respect for you,

1217
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,792
I really do, believe me,
this proof of your courage,

1218
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,155
and your spirit of sacrifice,

1219
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,278
but you must understand
it's useless to continue.

1220
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,598
You're a Communist.

1221
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,911
Your party has a pact
of alliance

1222
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,798
with the forces of reaction,

1223
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,033
now united against us,

1224
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,716
but tomorrow, when Rome
is occupied,

1225
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,077
or liberated, as you say,

1226
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:17,028
do you think those monarchists
will still be your allies?

1227
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,109
I'm offering to settle
the problem;

1228
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,800
give me the names of
the Bradogliano generals,

1229
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,235
set up the arrests,

1230
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,516
and I guarantee your freedom,

1231
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,319
and amnesty for the members
of your party,

1232
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,870
are we agreed, Mister Ferraris?

1233
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,310
I told you he wouldn't talk so easily.

1234
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,427
Got a cigarette?

1235
01:26:06,642 --> 01:26:08,227
The priest, quick.

1236
01:26:15,924 --> 01:26:18,507
Look at that.
Are you satisfied?

1237
01:26:18,672 --> 01:26:20,619
Is that your christian charity?

1238
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:23,412
Is that love for your
'brother in Christ'?

1239
01:26:23,572 --> 01:26:26,438
You prefer to see him reduced
to a pulp rather than talk.

1240
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,659
Don't think you'll save yourself,
you hypocritical priest,

1241
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:31,649
or your accomplices.

1242
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:33,245
You'll get a traitor's end,

1243
01:26:33,412 --> 01:26:36,674
we'll destroy you down to
the very last one.

1244
01:26:37,754 --> 01:26:38,976
You haven't talked.

1245
01:27:21,096 --> 01:27:22,126
It's over.

1246
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:23,638
It's over.

1247
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:28,421
You wanted his soul and
you've destroyed his body.

1248
01:27:28,585 --> 01:27:30,091
Bastards!

1249
01:27:30,298 --> 01:27:31,487
Bastards!

1250
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,707
You'll be stamped into the mud
like miserable worms.

1251
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:36,101
Bastards!

1252
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,860
My God, what have I said?

1253
01:27:49,499 --> 01:27:52,954
Forgive me, Lord, forgive me.

1254
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:17,422
Get out of here.
Bring the priest.

1255
01:28:17,703 --> 01:28:18,575
Quick.

1256
01:28:20,093 --> 01:28:22,279
Stupid Italians...

1257
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,226
Damn it!
That priest has ruined

1258
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:28,131
all my plans.

1259
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,327
I told you it wouldn't be so simple.

1260
01:28:30,491 --> 01:28:32,201
You're always right.

1261
01:28:32,363 --> 01:28:33,676
Major, what do I put on the form?

1262
01:28:34,673 --> 01:28:37,052
Ah, yes, cause of death.

1263
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,965
- Heart attack.
- At your orders.

1264
01:28:41,127 --> 01:28:42,157
What do I do with her?

1265
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:43,669
She's your affair.

1266
01:28:43,836 --> 01:28:45,818
Let her rest.
We'll see about her later.

1267
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,014
Come on. I need a drink.

1268
01:28:48,178 --> 01:28:51,599
Excuse me, sir.
What name do I fill in?

1269
01:28:51,843 --> 01:28:55,139
- Manfredi or Ferraris?
- Just Episcovo.

1270
01:28:55,309 --> 01:28:56,736
Giovanni Episcovo.

1271
01:28:56,902 --> 01:28:59,881
If we don't want another martyr.
We already have enough.

1272
01:29:00,049 --> 01:29:01,396
Just a second, please.

1273
01:29:13,593 --> 01:29:15,700
That way, I can use it again.

1274
01:29:17,577 --> 01:29:20,080
We're not a superior race.

1275
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:28,849
What's the time?

1276
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:31,117
- 8.15, sir.
- Exactly.

1277
01:29:31,281 --> 01:29:33,546
- They're late.
- Yes, sir. They are late.

1278
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:35,614
- Like a cigarette?
- Thank you, sir.

1279
01:29:40,523 --> 01:29:41,745
Give me a light.

1280
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:09,160
Line up.

1281
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:17,439
Hurry.

1282
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:42,417
- Your hat, Don Pietro.
- Oh, yes.

1283
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:45,922
Thank you.

1284
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,004
Be brave.

1285
01:30:57,207 --> 01:30:59,835
It's not hard to die well.

1286
01:31:00,594 --> 01:31:02,497
The hard thing is to live well.

1287
01:32:15,964 --> 01:32:16,836
Fire!

1288
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,101
God, forgive them.
