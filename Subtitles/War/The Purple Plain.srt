1
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,324
Ralph! Why isn't this plane
ready to fly?

2
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:48,195
You want us all to be blown
to kingdom come? Get going!

3
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,560
What's the matter with you?
What are you trying to do?

4
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,803
What are you trying to do?

5
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:05,848
You idiot!

6
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:13,985
Sorry, sir.

7
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,418
Are you all right?

8
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:20,492
Everything's okay, sir.
There's no bombing.

9
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,367
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

10
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,996
- l'll get Dr. Harris up here.
- No, wait a minute.

11
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:34,907
l'm all right. l'm fine.

12
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:36,907
l thought...

13
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:40,611
You'd better get some sleep, sir.
You're on the first flight in the morning.

14
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:45,116
Yeah.

15
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,623
All right, Sergeant, fine.

16
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:49,186
Fine.

17
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,727
Black Dog Leader to squadron.
Light flak ahead.

18
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,600
Let's get above it. Over.

19
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,234
Red Two to Leader,
message received. Out.

20
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,535
What's the matter?
Didn't you hear the C.O.'s orders?

21
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,837
Leader to Red Two,
what's your trouble?

22
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,538
- <i>What is your trouble?</i>
- Didn't you hear the orders?

23
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,815
<i>Leader to Red Two,</i>
<i>are you receiving me?</i>

24
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:22,045
- <i>Acknowledge.</i>
- Can't you hear the orders?

25
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,883
<i>Acknowledge. Over.</i>

26
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:29,921
<i>Leader to Red Two, do you</i>--

27
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,516
Okay, Doc.

28
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:10,316
Got him?

29
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,660
Yep. Now, gently does it.

30
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,825
Hello, Doc.
See the conquering hero come.

31
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,995
- What was it, cannon shell?
- Ack-ack. l put on a tourniquet.

32
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,195
Thanks.

33
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,641
Have you released the tourniquet
since it was put on?

34
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:31,307
- No, Doc, l left it all for you.
- Oh, good.

35
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,717
How soon?

36
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:45,024
- l guess about a couple of days, sir.
- What do you mean, a couple of days?

37
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:48,031
Well, sir, it's probably chewed up
all the cables inside, and l don't think--

38
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,933
l don't care what you don't think.
Just get it fixed, but quick.

39
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,234
That'll be all right till we get you to hospital.
A few minutes more won't hurt you.

40
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:02,336
We'll try not to shake you up
too much on the way.

41
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,540
You can shake
as much as you like, Doc.

42
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,982
Oh? Feeling good, eh?

43
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:10,578
- l feel fine. So would you.
- What, with a piece out of my arm?

44
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:14,557
Sure, if it meant you didn't have to fly
anymore with a raving lunatic.

45
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,731
Where's that ruddy fool
think he's going?

46
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:32,741
Hey, look out!

47
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:45,077
Round the bend, Nobby, boy.
Right round the bend.

48
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:49,457
All right, driver.

49
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,960
- Well, Doc?
- Hello, sir.

50
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:57,024
The arm's all right.
l'll evacuate him to Calcutta tomorrow.

51
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,296
But you won't be
seeing him again for a month or two.

52
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,635
l guessed that.
l've asked for a replacement.

53
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:05,005
We're a bit short
of navigators at the moment.

54
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:09,938
What l really came to talk
to you about is our problem boy.

55
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:11,879
Forrester.

56
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,349
What about him?

57
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:16,111
Didn't his navigator
tell you what happened?

58
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,553
- Yes, he did.
- Well?

59
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,049
Not my department, is it, sir?

60
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,755
Well, yes, Doc, l think it is.
This isn't the first time, and you know it.

61
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:29,733
- Nothing wrong with his nerve, is there?
- No, nothing.

62
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,996
Except l think he's round the bend.

63
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,801
What, because he went in without orders
and pranged some ack-ack guns?

64
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:37,864
Some people would
call that a very good show.

65
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:42,538
Well, l don't. l'd say he was
trying to get himself wrapped up.

66
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:47,176
Look, Doc, l know he volunteered
for this show, l know he's a good man,

67
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,777
but l'm going to
have to get rid of him.

68
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,185
You think he's cracking up.

69
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,918
No, l don't.
l think he cracked up years ago.

70
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,191
That's not what his record says.

71
00:09:57,262 --> 00:10:01,358
First-class fighter pilot,
Battle of Britain, DSO and the rest.

72
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,963
He must have taken
a few chances in his time.

73
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:07,664
Does the record say
they were always necessary?

74
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:12,334
The fact is he's beginning to give
people the willies and he'll have to go.

75
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,747
lf what you say is true, sir,

76
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,648
l should think that'd
just about finish him.

77
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:23,482
Well, have you got
any other suggestions?

78
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,046
- What about talking to him?
- l just have. Tore a strip off him.

79
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,457
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

80
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,428
Matter of fact,
he made me feel a complete fool.

81
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,922
Yes, l've noticed he has that effect.

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,333
All the same, sir, l'd like to talk to him
before you do anything drastic.

83
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:43,002
All right.
Don't be too long about it.

84
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:44,871
See you at dinner.

85
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:54,406
Don't tell me you find it hot.

86
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:58,916
This is really the springtime.
The real heat begins in June, the rain.

87
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,918
- Bet you just love that.
- l don't love it.

88
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:05,114
Bet you really get warmed up then
and get some letters written.

89
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:09,125
- l write home every day.
- Only once a day? You're slipping.

90
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,569
Of course,
heat affects people different ways.

91
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,505
Now, take me.

92
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,408
l watch my health,
take plenty of salt, of course,

93
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:30,413
but l think the real secret
is in one's mental attitude.

94
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,540
Now, l've got responsibilities--

95
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:35,347
a wife in England, a family,
an important job.

96
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,388
But it's no use moping.

97
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,446
You know, the trouble
with you flying people is that

98
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,924
you're not interested
in anything else but flying.

99
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:46,151
There's a world, people.
You don't care.

100
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,462
You need a home, children,
a thought for the future.

101
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,563
Now, if you were married
and knew that when the war was over,

102
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,766
you had a wife to go back to...

103
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,455
What? What?

104
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,496
What's the matter?

105
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:42,177
- l thought you said something.
- That was hours ago.

106
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:06,663
Now, l say, that's the trouble with you--
no outside responsibilities.

107
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:09,763
You want a wife and family
and thought for the future.

108
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,105
Now, if you were married and knew
that when the war was over, you could--

109
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,786
Hello.

110
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:38,886
Hello.

111
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:41,625
- Been looking for you.
- Something you wanted?

112
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,963
l wondered if you'd care
for a trip out of camp--

113
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,902
a village across the plain,
Christian community.

114
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:50,807
What makes you think l had
anything to do with Christian communities?

115
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,775
lt's just a trip, half an hour.

116
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:58,313
- You go.
- Really nice people.

117
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:00,373
Very interesting, pure Burmese.

118
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:03,909
They speak English.
l buy fruit from them.

119
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,752
Well, you bring me back
a nice cold melon, will you, Doc?

120
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:14,491
What's this?

121
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,228
To kill or not to kill,
that's all. That's--

122
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:38,547
Strange how fascinating
death can be, isn't it?

123
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,151
Very.

124
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:46,325
- ls that why you became a doctor?
- No.

125
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:48,888
l try to keep my patients alive.

126
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:55,930
Thou shalt not kill but need not strive
officiously to keep alive.

127
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:58,406
- Did you ever hear that saying?
- Frequently.

128
00:17:58,476 --> 00:17:59,568
Come on, get in.

129
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:01,872
l see.

130
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,847
A nice jeep ride, a cozy chat--

131
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,610
a medical inspection.

132
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,311
Okay, Doc.

133
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,247
Very tactfully arranged.

134
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,758
Well, l have to gain
my patients' confidence somehow.

135
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,879
Another one of my patients.

136
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:48,186
That's the dispensary.
l'll take you over later.

137
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:30,200
Off with you, you little devils!

138
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,142
Here we are.
This is for you.

139
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:42,372
Now hop it.

140
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:46,274
They're wonderful kids.
l love them all.

141
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,908
What is this place?

142
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:50,681
lt used to belong to a planter.
Now Miss McNab's got it.

143
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,915
- Who's she?
- Missionary. Runs the school.

144
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,480
But she won't be here today.

145
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,782
Ah, here's Dorothy.

146
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,830
- Good afternoon, Doctor.
- Hello, Dorothy.

147
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,231
l've brought a friend,
Squadron Leader Forrester.

148
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:07,429
He's a pilot.
Dorothy's from Rangoon.

149
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,165
- Glad to know you.
- How do you do?

150
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,231
Dorothy, my dear,
we're thirsty men.

151
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:14,175
Of course.
Please sit down, Mr. Forrester,

152
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,236
and l will get you
something cold to drink.

153
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,110
That's very kind of you.

154
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:21,174
Lime juice, please.
The lime juice is wonderful.

155
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:24,419
- Whatever you wish.
- The lime juice will be just fine.

156
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,888
- Where's Anna?
- At the dispensary.

157
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:28,925
- She'll be back soon.
- Oh, good.

158
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:33,723
- l managed to bring a little rice.
- Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

159
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,197
Please sit down,
and l will get the lime.

160
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,564
Thank you.

161
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:45,399
l usually try and bring them
something for the kitchen.

162
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:47,842
Fruit's all right,
but not all the time.

163
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,641
They can't buy food.

164
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:54,044
They came here
stripped of everything,

165
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:55,949
all the way from Rangoon.

166
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,751
Can you imagine what it
must have been like?

167
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:02,223
Hundreds of miles.

168
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,091
l don't know how any of them
ever got through alive.

169
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,864
l hope l didn't waken you.

170
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,603
l'm sorry, l must have
fallen asleep for a moment.

171
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:52,039
Several moments.

172
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:56,678
Where's the doctor?

173
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:59,011
He and Dorothy went down
to the dispensary.

174
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,344
l'm Anna.

175
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,152
How do you do?

176
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:08,648
My name's Forrester.

177
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:10,924
l know.

178
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:14,220
They sent me up here
to see if you were all right.

179
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:27,466
They said that you'd gone to sleep
even before you had time to have a drink.

180
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:29,569
Well, that was very rude of me.

181
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:32,706
lt was very, very rude.

182
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:34,808
But no one minded at all.

183
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,156
Please sit down.

184
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,252
Thank you.

185
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,433
That's the best lime
l've ever tasted.

186
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,069
When one is thirsty,
it always tastes better.

187
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:11,615
- Have you been in Burma long?
- About three months.

188
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:15,385
- Do you like it?
- Well, l don't know really.

189
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,156
Life's pretty much the same
on an airfield, whatever country you're in.

190
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,254
Except that it's hotter here.

191
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:23,595
When the cooler weather comes,
you may like it better.

192
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,795
Oh, l don't dislike it.
l just don't know it.

193
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:30,535
No one knows it,
not all of Burma.

194
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,875
Rice and rubies--

195
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,743
that's about all l knew about Burma
before l came here.

196
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,984
There are stones here
if you wish to buy them, Mr. Forrester.

197
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:45,811
Well, that's very kind of you.

198
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:47,288
lt's isn't far.

199
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:52,322
Well...l think the doctor
will be wanting to get back.

200
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:56,264
Oh, no, he always goes late.
There's plenty of time.

201
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:00,861
All right.

202
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,336
l'll be glad.

203
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,201
These are rubies, sir.

204
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:10,377
Yes.

205
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:14,548
These are white sapphires.

206
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,979
And these are golden amethysts.

207
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:22,687
They're very nice.

208
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:33,032
They say that if you will come tomorrow,
they will try to have a bigger selection.

209
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:35,401
Zircons and emeralds, perhaps.

210
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,704
That's very kind of them.

211
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:44,178
Tell them that l'll try to make it.

212
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:01,795
Thank you.

213
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,096
Please, thank you.

214
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,501
Please. Good-bye, sir.

215
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,505
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

216
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:14,272
Good-bye. Thank you.

217
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:21,473
You didn't really want
to buy the stones, did you?

218
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:22,814
Not really, no.

219
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,720
You're the first officer who's
come here and not bought jewels.

220
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,189
Am l?

221
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:32,524
All of them come for jewels,
so l assumed that you had, too.

222
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,364
That is why l took you to those people.
You should have said.

223
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:40,893
lt was very interesting. lt's just that
l have no one in particular to give jewels to.

224
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:45,433
No one? l'm sorry.

225
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:47,766
No need to be sorry.

226
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,713
The doctor tells me that your
sister comes from Rangoon. You too?

227
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:55,809
Yes. l was
at the university there.

228
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,980
- Studying what?
- The humanities.

229
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:02,958
lt's not very much use to me here.
But l have learned a little about nursing,

230
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,256
so now l help the doctor
with the sick in the village.

231
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,991
- Are there many sick?
- l'm afraid there are.

232
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:10,662
How do they feel about us being here?

233
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:14,067
lt's been explained to them
that it is necessary.

234
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:17,804
lt's been explained to us, too,
that it's necessary.

235
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:25,314
Down there's the river.
We swim there.

236
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,514
Any crocodiles?

237
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:30,519
No, no crocodiles.

238
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,546
Very nice here.

239
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:38,925
Next time l fly over this place,
it'll seem more friendly.

240
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,022
Didn't it seem friendly before?

241
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:45,862
Never thought about it.

242
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,595
Most of you people
hate it here, don't you?

243
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,639
You long for home.

244
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,143
l don't.

245
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:55,834
Not ever?

246
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:57,939
Nope.

247
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:04,287
Well, l guess the doctor will
be wanting to get back to camp.

248
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:23,371
Oy-oy, here he is.

249
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:30,041
Who's gonna tell him
the good news? You?

250
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:31,307
Yes, l'll tell him.

251
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,017
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, sir.

252
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:36,575
- How's it coming?
- l'll have her ready for you by tonight, sir.

253
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:39,087
Fine. By the way,
the oil cooler in this engine--

254
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,420
l meant to tell you yesterday,
you'd better change it.

255
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:44,582
Not me, sir.

256
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,132
What are you talking about?

257
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,727
Time expired, sir. Due for release.
Came through last night.

258
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,533
Me and Clark,
both going home together.

259
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:58,165
- Clark? Who's Clark?
- Me, sir.

260
00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:00,738
- Oh, Nobby.
- Yes, sir.

261
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,371
Been together ever since
we first joined, sir, Nobby and me.

262
00:28:05,782 --> 00:28:07,511
Congratulations.

263
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,491
Oh, Forrester, l thought
you were over at Doc's.

264
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:22,088
l couldn't find you anywhere.

265
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,293
This is Carrington, your new navigator.

266
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:27,166
Got in earlier by Dak from Komilla.

267
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:29,467
This is Squadron Leader Forrester.

268
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,435
How do you do, sir?

269
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:33,738
Who told you to move in here?

270
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:36,077
Well, the Messing Officer.

271
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,580
They're moving a lot of new bodies in.
Everywhere is full up.

272
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:40,138
Anyway, it's only for tonight.

273
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:42,913
l'm being sent up to Meiktila.
l'll be leaving tomorrow.

274
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:45,216
Everything's in a mess
at the moment.

275
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:48,089
So l see.

276
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:22,016
- l seem to have put up a black.
- Oh, he's an impossible man.

277
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:25,721
Of course, we all feel the heat.
And three in a tent really is too many,

278
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:28,959
but that's no reason to behave
in such a boorish way.

279
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,728
Still, l suppose it was a bit
high-handed of the Messing Officer

280
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:34,464
just to stick me in here
without even consulting him.

281
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:37,871
Yes, but what you don't realize is that
Forrester invites that sort of treatment.

282
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:39,806
Puts people's backs up.

283
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:43,676
Thank goodness l'm a wingless wonder.
l don't envy you flying with him.

284
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:45,941
Why?

285
00:29:46,016 --> 00:29:49,110
Well, everyone knows
he's round the bend. Everyone.

286
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:02,589
- Ah, well met.
- Hello, Doc.

287
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,964
l was coming over to see you.

288
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:07,469
- l've an invitation for you.
- Yes?

289
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,596
Miss McNab, the missionary
from the village--

290
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,038
dinner tonight.

291
00:30:11,107 --> 00:30:12,096
No, thanks.

292
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,871
l take over some rice
and a can of meat and they make curry.

293
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:16,071
lt's delicious.

294
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:17,738
l'm sure it is, but l can't make it.

295
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:19,372
l'll pick you up at 7:00.

296
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:21,781
l said no thanks.

297
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,919
Here, you take this.

298
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:34,023
l'll take the rice.

299
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:39,126
We are not divided

300
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:43,866
All one body we

301
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,101
One in hope and doctrine

302
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:47,336
Come on.

303
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,680
One in charity

304
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:59,255
Onward, Christian soldiers

305
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:04,157
Marching as to war

306
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:08,630
With the cross of Jesus
going on before

307
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:11,667
- Good evening, Dr. Harris.
- Good evening, Dorothy.

308
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,259
- Good evening, Mr. Forrester.
- Good evening.

309
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:16,271
- Something for the kitchen.
- Oh, how good of you.

310
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:17,829
l'll be in in a minute.

311
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,378
Ah, good evening, Dr. Harris!
Good evening to you.

312
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,471
Good evening, Miss McNab.
Can l introduce--

313
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:28,416
This will be Squadron Leader Forrester,
l have no doubt.

314
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:31,045
lt's an honor
and a pleasure, Mr. Forrester.

315
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:34,215
- l'm glad you were able to come.
- That's very kind of you.

316
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,885
Nobody told me
you were so handsome.

317
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,928
Come on, let me introduce you.

318
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,888
This is Anna's mother.

319
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,364
How do you do?

320
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,835
She can't answer you
because she can't speak.

321
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:50,100
She hasn't spoken
since the Japs bombed us in Rangoon.

322
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,367
l'm sorry.

323
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:54,973
- Hello, Mr. Phang.
- A pleasure, Doctor, as always.

324
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,673
- This is Mr. Phang.
- How do you do, Mr. Phang?

325
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:00,443
Very pleased indeed, sir,
to meet so distinguished an officer.

326
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:05,147
lt'll be no surprise to you to learn that
Mr. Phang studied English at the university.

327
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:07,689
English literature
to be precise, Mr. Forrester.

328
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:10,555
Oh, Doctor,
remember l am relying on you

329
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:13,562
to have plenty of ideas
about the hymns for Easter.

330
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,190
l've been thinking of nothing else.

331
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,324
Mr. Phang!

332
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,664
Excuse me.
Yes, Miss McNab?

333
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,170
- Get me another glass, please.
- Certainly.

334
00:32:23,873 --> 00:32:26,808
- l'm glad you were able to come.
- lt's good to see you again.

335
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,544
lt was very good
of Miss McNab to ask me.

336
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:35,279
Mr. Forrester, do you know
that foul, benighted, godless city Katarba?

337
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:37,718
l'm telling you, the only good thing
that ever came out of it

338
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:40,847
was the bottle of whiskey
the doctor brought us back from there.

339
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:43,188
l don't touch the stuff myself.

340
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,126
But l daresay it won't do you
any harm while you're waiting for the dinner.

341
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:49,029
- There.
- Thank you, Miss McNab.

342
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:52,830
- And what is it you fly?
- Mosquitoes, fighter-bombers.

343
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:55,962
l say they are
wicked, devilish things.

344
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,404
True.

345
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:04,803
l see you are one of the quiet,
thoughtful ones, Mr. Forrester.

346
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:08,874
You didn't tell me that, Anna.
She's very shy, of course.

347
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:12,149
Well, drink your whiskey.
Dinner will be ready soon.

348
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,186
l told you l'd come again.

349
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:20,822
l hoped you would.

350
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:22,762
Miss McNab says you're very shy.

351
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:25,460
Compared to Miss McNab,
everyone is shy.

352
00:33:25,535 --> 00:33:26,934
She's quite a character.

353
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:29,970
We love her.

354
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:33,933
lf it hadn't been for her, none of us
would have got here from Rangoon.

355
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:37,941
Yes, the doctor was telling me.
Seems incredible.

356
00:33:38,782 --> 00:33:41,410
Strange things happened
during the war.

357
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:42,951
Yes.

358
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:46,122
Strange landing places.

359
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:49,048
Strange meetings.

360
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,697
Dinner! Dinner!

361
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:04,737
lt's delicious.

362
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:08,642
Shall we go?

363
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,711
Some more curry, Mr. Forrester.
You're not eating a thing.

364
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:20,756
- Did you not like it?
- Oh, it was terrific.

365
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:22,689
l've eaten too much already, thanks.

366
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:25,952
l've been admiring your tablecloth.

367
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:29,829
Ah, you have an eye
for fine things, Mr. Forrester.

368
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:32,868
lt was worked by the girls
at the mission in Rangoon for Miss McNab.

369
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:35,063
They gave it to her
on her 21st birthday.

370
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,535
Take no notice of him, Mr. Forrester.
l'm not ashamed of my age.

371
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,068
For my 45th birthday they made it,

372
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,479
and all the way from Rangoon,
through every inch of the way,

373
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:50,280
l kept telling myself,
''McNab, whatever else you may lose,

374
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:53,083
you'll not be losing
that tablecloth the girls gave you.''

375
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,384
lt's a beautiful thing.

376
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:55,719
Aye.

377
00:34:57,193 --> 00:35:00,924
Three hundred of us died
on that journey, Mr. Forrester.

378
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:04,098
That's how old l am.

379
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,432
Miss McNab,
when l get back home,

380
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:10,439
l'm going to see that you're decorated
if it's the last thing l do.

381
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:14,443
Ach, don't gab so much.
Give Mr. Forrester a cup of tea, Anna.

382
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:16,672
No, no. l mean it.

383
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:21,115
lf you want to decorate someone,
you should decorate the good Lord.

384
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,015
lf you could get His name
in the honors list,

385
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,644
you'd be talking, l'm telling you.

386
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:27,349
Well, if you'll write the citation,
l'll see what l can do.

387
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:30,187
What you can do, Dr. Harris,
is to think about Easter.

388
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,990
What's your favorite hymn
for Easter, Mr. Forrester?

389
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:36,224
Oh, Easter hymns?

390
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:45,697
''Hallelujah,'' isn't it?

391
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:48,403
Yes. ''Hallelujah.''

392
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:51,270
''Hallelujah.

393
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:54,646
Jesus Christ is risen today.''

394
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,150
Ah, that's splendid.

395
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:59,017
l can see you've been
well brought up, Mr. Forrester.

396
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,347
Come on, we'll all sing it.

397
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:23,104
Jesus Christ is risen today

398
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:28,048
Hallelujah

399
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:32,747
Our triumphant holy day

400
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:37,782
Hallelujah

401
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:42,321
Who did once upon the cross

402
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:47,893
Hallelujah

403
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:52,431
Suffer to redeem our loss

404
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:57,969
Hallelujah

405
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:03,585
Hymns of praise
then let us sing

406
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:08,590
Hallelujah

407
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:13,755
Unto Christ, our heavenly king

408
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,290
Hallelujah

409
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:23,431
Who endured the cross and grave...

410
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:26,431
What is it?

411
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:30,468
Jap bombers.
They're trying to find the airstrip.

412
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:32,377
There's too much light here.
You shut the door.

413
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:38,387
But the pains that He endured

414
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:43,790
Hallelujah

415
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:48,527
There's quite a bunch of them.

416
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:51,795
The children will be frightened.
l ought to get down to the dispensary.

417
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:52,857
Come on, then.

418
00:37:55,305 --> 00:37:56,294
Look out!

419
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:15,015
Look out!

420
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:24,860
Anna!

421
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:27,096
Anna?!

422
00:38:30,406 --> 00:38:31,395
Anna!

423
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,186
Are you all right?

424
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,399
Yes. Yes, l'm all right.

425
00:38:58,468 --> 00:38:59,867
Are you sure?

426
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:03,832
- Are you all right here?
- Yeah, all right.

427
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:05,897
Come along, then.
We'll be needed in the village.

428
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:08,500
Dorothy's looking after your mother.
Come on, Mr. Phang!

429
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:26,721
Anna, you'd better get in there
and help out. l'll be in in a minute.

430
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:31,260
You two better go and collect the casualties
and bring them along here.

431
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:45,676
- What's this? What's going on?
- Escape from the Japanese.

432
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:47,511
The Japs aren't coming back here.

433
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,915
These people don't know that.
They've been bombed before.

434
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:11,400
Will you please attend
to this one, Doctor, now.

435
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:13,442
- l'll finish that dressing.
- Right.

436
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:38,825
Anna, you'd better go back
to the bungalow and lie down.

437
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:41,463
l'm all right, Doctor.

438
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:43,801
No, you're not.
You're still suffering from shock.

439
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:45,864
Now do as l say, please.
Give me that.

440
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:58,837
l told her to go back to the bungalow.
She's still suffering from shock.

441
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:02,146
- She got caught up in the crowd.
- l'm all right.

442
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:05,813
You lie down here for a while.
Put that blanket over her, will you?

443
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,255
l must be getting back.

444
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:11,816
That last lot sounded as if it was
near the camp. l'll be needed there.

445
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:12,883
l'd better go, too.

446
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:15,590
There's nothing you can do there,
but there's a lot you can do here.

447
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:18,225
- l'll call over for you in the morning.
- Right.

448
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,633
Mr. Forrester.

449
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:30,572
Would you hold her
while l finish bandaging?

450
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:31,635
Surely.

451
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:36,707
Excuse me if l ask you
a personal question, Mr. Forrester,

452
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:38,981
but are you married?

453
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:40,920
No.

454
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:42,952
l'm glad.

455
00:42:47,563 --> 00:42:50,555
- Do you hear?
- Yes, l hear.

456
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,500
They are not like us, made of ice.

457
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:56,663
They get rid of their sorrow
and their fear.

458
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:02,974
They don't leave it inside, Mr. Forrester,
as you or l might, to rot.

459
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:07,907
That'll be all, Mr. Forrester.

460
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:09,952
lf you wouldn't mind
taking her over to the other children,

461
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,544
l'll see about getting Anna
something hot to drink.

462
00:43:56,532 --> 00:43:59,990
The doc's here now.
l'll have to go over to the camp.

463
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:04,062
Please don't go for a moment.
l have something to tell you.

464
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:29,058
- You were going to tell me something.
- lt wasn't much.

465
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,463
Tell me.

466
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:34,166
lt was something to give you.

467
00:44:37,606 --> 00:44:39,506
Open it. lt's for you.

468
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:55,453
lt's for you.

469
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:01,156
You have no one to give it to?

470
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:02,820
No.

471
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:07,096
l'm glad, because now
you can keep it for me.

472
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:16,168
- l can't say anything.
- Don't say anything.

473
00:45:16,245 --> 00:45:18,213
There's nothing to say.

474
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,272
lt's only a little thing
for you to keep for me, that's all.

475
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:32,653
Anna...

476
00:45:42,037 --> 00:45:45,996
Early in the war
l met a girl and fell in love.

477
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:54,809
When l got leave,
we went to London and got married.

478
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:56,215
And that night...

479
00:45:57,953 --> 00:46:01,184
while we were out
having dinner...

480
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,061
there was an air raid,

481
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,362
and the building that we were in
got a direct hit.

482
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:17,867
She was killed.

483
00:46:24,613 --> 00:46:25,910
After that...

484
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,317
l didn't want to go on living.

485
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:34,887
You'd think that'd be easy enough
in war, but it didn't work.

486
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:38,991
l wanted to die,
but l got medals instead.

487
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:44,296
l could see the trouble
in your face when you first came.

488
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:46,630
lt is not good to die inside.

489
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:50,372
lt was like living a bad dream.

490
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:53,169
Here we bury
the dead in the earth,

491
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:55,369
not in our hearts.

492
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,512
ls the dream over now?

493
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:00,573
l think so.

494
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,643
You said something
about never going home.

495
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:08,315
- What did you mean?
- l meant just that.

496
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,119
Would you rather stay here?

497
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:13,791
l never want to be anywhere else.

498
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:16,696
And will you always come back?

499
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,162
Always.

500
00:47:20,603 --> 00:47:22,901
Then l will always be here.

501
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:58,837
- Good morning, sir.
- Oh, hello, Bill.

502
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:00,671
- Sit down, will you?
- Thanks.

503
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:06,074
Rather a dull job for you today, l'm afraid.
l know you won't mind helping out.

504
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:09,481
You haven't flown with that new
navigator of yours yet, have you?

505
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,611
No, sir, not yet.

506
00:48:11,687 --> 00:48:14,349
l've got to send a body
over to Meiktila today.

507
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:16,721
You'll be trying out
the new chap anyway,

508
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:19,352
so l thought if you wouldn't
mind going that way,

509
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,089
we'd kill two birds with one stone.

510
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:23,358
Sure. Who's the body?

511
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:25,832
- Blore.
- Blore.

512
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:29,496
- lt will be a pleasure.
- You don't like him, eh?

513
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:31,972
- We've been sharing a tent.
- Oh, l see.

514
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:36,239
He's a good bloke, though.
A Cambridge man, physics.

515
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:37,836
He's very clever, l believe.

516
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:41,377
Didn't know that.

517
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,977
Well, l've told Blore
he may be going with you.

518
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:47,746
l'll bet that was
a real thrill for him.

519
00:48:47,823 --> 00:48:51,452
There's nothing wrong with old Blore.
He's like the rest of us--

520
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,461
sometimes needs a change of air.

521
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:54,757
Yes, sir.

522
00:49:07,142 --> 00:49:08,837
l hear you're gonna be my passenger.

523
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:13,646
Yes. How long will it take?

524
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:16,116
l can't say.
Carrington will have to figure that out.

525
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:20,011
- Thought l might find him here.
- He went over to the crew tent.

526
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,624
Well, how soon do you think
you'll be ready?

527
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:28,720
- l've got all my stuff to pack.
- So l see.

528
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:34,267
- There's no great hurry.
- l'd like to get it properly packed.

529
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:36,566
- Anything l can do to help?
- No, thanks.

530
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,370
No, don't touch anything, please.
l want to be sure everything's here.

531
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:44,011
Well, is there anything
l can fix you up with?

532
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,741
You'll need all the comfort
you can get at Meiktila.

533
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:49,306
l don't think that's very funny.

534
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:51,046
lt wasn't meant to be.

535
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,645
Hello, Carrington.
We've got a job to do.

536
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:55,087
Yes, sir, l heard.

537
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:58,251
l'll take you over to lntelligence.
You can make out your flight plan.

538
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:01,321
You think you can
be ready by 12:00?

539
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:03,024
- Yes, l think so.
- Good.

540
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:07,734
lt's only a small trip, this.
lnteresting from your point of view, though.

541
00:50:19,982 --> 00:50:21,313
Are you ready?

542
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:24,511
Got a hammock rigged up for you
in the bomb bay. Best we could do.

543
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:38,856
Okay, let's go.

544
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:32,346
Everything okay?

545
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:34,650
All okay.

546
00:51:39,962 --> 00:51:41,896
Passenger asleep.

547
00:51:43,065 --> 00:51:44,896
He's lucky.

548
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:49,700
By the way,
this is Jap territory here--

549
00:51:49,772 --> 00:51:51,262
up to the river.

550
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:58,836
They're welcome to it.

551
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:13,523
Over there, Mandalay.

552
00:52:14,496 --> 00:52:17,522
- Where the dawn comes up like thunder?
- That's the place.

553
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,727
Would you like to have a look
after we've delivered the body?

554
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:22,065
Roger.

555
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:32,180
Starboard engine.

556
00:52:46,395 --> 00:52:48,989
Starboard fuel off.

557
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:55,196
- We're going back.
- Roger.

558
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,068
Course 2-0-9er.

559
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:19,019
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

560
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:20,652
Kong K Cable to Scuttle.

561
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:23,254
Starboard engine now on fire.

562
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:25,197
Cannot extinguish.

563
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:28,896
My approximate position
is 90 miles southeast of you,

564
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:31,269
on course 2-0-9er.

565
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,035
Mayday.

566
00:53:46,154 --> 00:53:48,349
- Hold on, we're going down.
- Roger.

567
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:50,186
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

568
00:53:50,259 --> 00:53:52,193
Kong K Cable to Scuttle.

569
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,388
Crash landing, crash landing.

570
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:57,091
Kong K Cable to Scuttle.

571
00:53:57,165 --> 00:53:59,759
Crash landing. Crash landing.

572
00:53:59,835 --> 00:54:02,099
Mayday, mayday.

573
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,264
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 .

574
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,807
Mayday, mayday.

575
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:11,039
Kong K Cable to Scuttle.
We're preparing to crash-land.

576
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:13,980
Crash landing, crash landing.
Mayday!

577
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:16,142
Mayday! Mayday!

578
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:48,305
Carrington!

579
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:10,433
Let's get him outta here!

580
00:55:36,565 --> 00:55:38,430
You got anything to help him?

581
00:55:39,968 --> 00:55:43,096
- l've got some morphine, l think.
- Get it quick.

582
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:53,948
We'll give him one of these
and then get him into the shade.

583
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,282
Hello, Kong K Cable, this is Scuttle.
Hello, Kong K Cable, this is Scuttle.

584
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,017
Your QDM, 2-0-9er.

585
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,821
l say again, 2-0-9er.

586
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,724
How do you hear me? Over.

587
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,199
- Keep trying.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:21,834
Hello, Kong K Cable, this is Scuttle.
Hello, Kong K Cable, this is Scuttle.

589
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,402
Your QDM, 2-0-9er.

590
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,507
l say again, 2-0-9er...

591
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,580
How do you feel now?

592
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,909
l'd like a drink.

593
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,583
You got a nice cool
scotch and soda there, Blore?

594
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,092
l suppose you mean water.

595
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,524
We'll have to go carefully with it.

596
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,689
There's only the thermos flask
and the bottle.

597
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,909
How's that?

598
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,285
We were on course.

599
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,754
Now, don't you worry about that.
You just take it easy.

600
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,882
Did they get a fix on us?

601
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,123
l don't know.
l kept calling as long as l could.

602
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:52,726
They could work out our position
by time alone, l should say.

603
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,738
Parker saw the flight plan.
What time is it?

604
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,771
Four minutes past 2:00.

605
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:04,075
That's not quite four hours till dark.
Say three.

606
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,310
- They're bound to find us before then.
- You think so?

607
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:10,352
Certainly. They'll have us
out of here in no time.

608
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,447
Meanwhile, we must organize ourselves,
see what you have with you.

609
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:17,288
l haven't got a thing.
l was just flying the airplane.

610
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,827
But you must have something.

611
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,387
Even the smallest trifle may be useful
in an emergency like this.

612
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,069
Medical card.

613
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,833
Three rupees.

614
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:32,932
Handkerchief.

615
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:38,707
What's that?

616
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:48,322
Don't tell me you've been buying
those things. They're all phony, you know.

617
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,395
lf they got any kind of a fix on us,
which l doubt...

618
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,033
it's just possible that
they might locate us here.

619
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,078
Supposing they do, what then?

620
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,079
Well, they get us out, of course.

621
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:13,308
They haven't got helicopters.

622
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,146
Well, they could drop supplies.

623
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,813
So that we can camp out here until
the war is over? This is Jap territory.

624
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,857
Yes, we know that, but...
What are you getting at?

625
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,090
Mind if l use your hat?

626
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:40,972
Carrington, are you awake?

627
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,909
Yes, l'm awake.

628
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,142
- You heard that, what Forrester said?
- Yes, l heard.

629
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,741
Well, l think we've got
to be very careful.

630
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,786
Knowing him as l do,
well, frankly,

631
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,516
l don't think we ought to place any reliance
at all on his judgment about anything.

632
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,226
He got us down all right.

633
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,019
We wouldn't have stood
an earthly with some pilots.

634
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:04,589
l'm not saying he's not a good pilot,
but we're not in the air now.

635
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,601
He doesn't care what happens to him.

636
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,797
Well, l do care what happens to me,
and l'm not taking any chances.

637
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,601
lf we keep our heads,
we'll be all right.

638
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:14,199
l'm relying on you to back me up.

639
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,211
You got any more of those tablets?

640
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,475
There are only a few left.
They ought to be eked out.

641
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,528
What's all this for?

642
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,724
We want some sort of signal
when they come looking for us.

643
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,825
When who comes looking
for us, the Japs?

644
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:48,132
You know quite well
who l mean--our people.

645
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,574
l think it's time we took a look
at some of the facts.

646
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:57,477
l don't mind looking at the facts.
They seem straightforward enough to me.

647
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,708
Our people know
we made a forced landing.

648
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:03,980
Even if they didn't get a fix on us, they're
bound to know our approximate position.

649
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:06,112
Our job is to give them
all the help we can,

650
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,316
look after Carrington,
keep our heads, and...

651
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,723
- ...hope for the best.
- What's wrong with that?

652
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,920
Nothing, if you know
what the best adds up to.

653
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,259
They could look for a month
and not find this place.

654
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:19,267
- How long will the water last?
- Not as long as a month.

655
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,361
l've got a quart and what's left
in the thermos flask.

656
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,771
lf we ration ourselves strictly--
and Carrington, too, mind--

657
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,106
l suppose it might last three days.

658
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,667
Though in this heat...

659
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:34,112
- What's all this leading up to?
- Just this.

660
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,176
l think we ought to forget about setting up
housekeeping here and start walking.

661
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,513
Walking?
Are you serious?

662
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:46,085
Now look, we're roughly 30 miles
northeast of the river here.

663
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,687
l know this country
is murder to get across,

664
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:52,132
but we ought to be able
to make it in four days, even without food.

665
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,465
lf we make it,
we'll be in our own patrol area.

666
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,164
We'll have water to see us through.

667
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,833
But what about Carrington?
You don't expect him to walk, do you?

668
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,204
- We'll carry him.
- How can we?

669
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,046
We'll make a stretcher.
There's plenty of bamboo here,

670
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,415
and we've got a parachute harness--
we'll fix up something.

671
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:14,183
Carry a stretcher all that way in this heat
under this sun? We'll kill ourselves.

672
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,124
We don't go in the sun.
We go at night.

673
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,753
Have you ever carried a man
on a stretcher for any distance?

674
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:23,026
No, but l'm gonna try,
even if it does kill me.

675
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,496
Well, you can kill yourself
if you like, Forrester.

676
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,763
You've been round the bend for ages
and everybody knows it.

677
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,863
But you're not going to endanger our lives
just because you don't give a rat--

678
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,112
Help!

679
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,585
Help!

680
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,688
What is it?

681
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,625
Dak.

682
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:55,425
- Anyone we know?
- l can't tell, it's too high.

683
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:07,105
Blind fools.
Never even started to see us.

684
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,844
You have any idea
what it's like trying to locate

685
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,937
a burnt-out plane
in country like this?

686
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,107
l couldn't even recognize it
from the top of that rock.

687
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,708
lt'll be almost impossible from a plane.

688
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:20,244
Turbulence, heat haze, odd forest fires--
it's a million-to-one shot.

689
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,348
Blind, stupid fools.

690
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,414
Look...

691
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,791
We've got enough water
for three days, maybe four.

692
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,025
We've got a lot of pills
and no food.

693
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,260
Now either we sit here
and drink the water and hope,

694
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,896
or we drink the water and travel.
Does that make sense?

695
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:38,941
- lt would if it weren't for Carrington.
- l told you, we'll carry him.

696
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,101
The whole idea is crazy,
and you know it.

697
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:45,477
lt's still crazier to stay here.
Now let's get to work on the stretcher.

698
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,417
Well, l think Carrington
should be consulted about this.

699
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,546
Carrington has no option.
lt's his only chance.

700
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,487
Well, it's entirely your responsibility.

701
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,896
Responsibility, hell.

702
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:20,373
We're going to walk out of here
and try to reach the river--at night.

703
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,679
lt'll be quite simple--
we'll march for half an hour,

704
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,219
then rest for half an hour.

705
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,346
We're going to make
a stretcher and carry you.

706
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:30,085
- lt's hopeless.
- Blore thinks it's hopeless.

707
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,150
What do you think?
You'll have to navigate.

708
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,025
l don't know.

709
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,232
You can't just carry a bloke
on a stretcher as easily as all that.

710
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,031
lt's a piece of cake.

711
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,867
Blore and l are the champion
bloke-carriers of all Burma.

712
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,999
lsn't that right, Blore?

713
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,374
All you have to do is try
to get some sleep until it's dark.

714
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,810
Come on, Blore.

715
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:04,515
You ready?

716
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:07,985
All set.

717
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:10,532
Just sing out
if you feel yourself slipping.

718
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,500
Okay.

719
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,172
- How about you, Blore?
- No, now just a minute.

720
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:32,910
All right.

721
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,286
Ready? Lift.

722
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,713
All right, put him down.

723
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:42,524
lt's hopeless.
We'll never get a stretcher down there.

724
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,991
Will you stop saying it's hopeless?

725
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:50,258
We'll lower him feet first.
You swing this end around.

726
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,960
- Absolute madness, the whole thing.
- Shut up.

727
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,135
Lift.

728
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,748
All right, lower away.

729
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,093
Hold it!

730
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:37,935
All right, lower him.

731
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:40,708
Slowly.

732
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,080
That's it.

733
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,421
Take him over there.
We'll rest for a bit.

734
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,257
All right, pick him up.

735
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,192
Keep going.

736
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,256
How much longer?

737
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:30,028
lt'll be dawn soon.
We'll stop then and rest all day.

738
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,363
Supposing you slip on the rock
and break your ankle--

739
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:33,924
then where shall we be?

740
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,995
You tell him, Carrington.

741
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,367
- Up the creek.
- That's right.

742
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:43,775
And you'll have to
carry us both, Blore, old boy.

743
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,007
Should have stayed where we were.
l said so all along.

744
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:47,844
Yes, you did.

745
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,451
All right.
Let's get going.

746
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:58,982
Lift.

747
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,571
What's the matter?

748
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,703
There's a sheer drop.
We'll never get by it.

749
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,940
Yes, we will.
Just go carefully.

750
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:55,540
- You want me to go in front?
- Why, don't you think l'm competent?

751
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,680
Sure l do,
but let's keep going.

752
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,587
All right, all right.
You're the officer in charge, aren't you?

753
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,592
You're the person responsible.
All right, then you give the orders.

754
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,389
''Theirs not to reason why--''

755
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,319
Are you still with it?

756
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,454
Blore!

757
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,957
Blore?

758
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,849
Are you badly hurt?

759
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,556
''Badly'' is a comparative term, isn't it?
So l hardly like to--

760
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,685
Easy.

761
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:19,463
The water.
The thermos--where is it?

762
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:20,866
Right over here.

763
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:25,531
Everything's here.
There's nothing lost.

764
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,234
Let's have a look at you.

765
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,237
There's something wrong here.

766
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,944
Looks like you broke
your collarbone.

767
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:45,024
lt's a pretty badly scraped face.
You got some antiseptic in your pack?

768
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,990
l'll get the webbing off first.

769
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,431
lt'll be light soon.
We'll be able to see what we're doing.

770
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:00,306
l'm sorry. Hurt you?

771
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,536
No.

772
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,812
Just thinking
of something funny, that's all.

773
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,074
Well, that's good.

774
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,610
l was thinking,
fancy worrying about the water.

775
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,779
You had me worried
about it there for a minute.

776
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,415
- As if it matters.
- As if what matters?

777
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,753
Well, the water.

778
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:19,988
l mean, it isn't as if it's gonna be
any use to us now, is it?

779
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,024
lsn't it?

780
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,094
Better lie back.

781
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,227
Not for me and Carrington, anyway.

782
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,601
As far as l can see,

783
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:35,609
we might just as well shoot
ourselves now and have done with it.

784
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,576
Here.

785
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:04,500
- Any news yet, sir?
- Hello, Doc. Yes.

786
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,438
We've heard from the army.

787
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,211
The nearest patrol they've got
is about 20 miles

788
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,577
from Forrester's last estimated position.

789
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,946
They've got a signal through
to the officer commanding there,

790
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,885
told him to do what he can,
but l don't suppose that'll be very much.

791
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,854
You mean we can't expect the army

792
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:24,222
to go charging off 20 miles
into Jap territory

793
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,785
on the chance of finding three corpses
and a burnt-out plane.

794
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,626
That's about the size of it, yes.

795
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,757
So it looks like
a complete write-off.

796
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,028
Yes.

797
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:36,131
Well, thank you, sir.

798
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,074
Hello, Anna.

799
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,449
Tell me, please.

800
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,614
l've told you all there is to know.

801
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,157
Please.

802
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,760
They were on their way to Meiktila--

803
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,456
Forrester, the navigator,
and a passenger.

804
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,992
One of the engines caught fire.

805
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:10,736
We didn't have time to locate
their exact position,

806
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,603
but we know they were
over a Jap area.

807
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,108
We don't know
if they landed safely.

808
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,003
lt's bad country, though.

809
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,517
Did he know it would
be dangerous when he went?

810
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,985
No. lt was practically
a routine flight.

811
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,785
He just had bad luck.

812
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:33,624
Was the bad luck
because of something he had failed in?

813
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,162
No.

814
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,164
No, it wasn't his fault.

815
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,135
Then perhaps he will come back.

816
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,401
Aye, perhaps he will.

817
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,568
lf it's humanly possible.

818
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,146
He said he would come back.

819
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:31,846
Forrester.

820
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,751
- What's the matter?
- A plane.

821
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:44,259
There it is!

822
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,246
That plane was looking for us.
So was the other one.

823
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,652
We should have had more sense than
to leave our position until they found us.

824
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,556
Now when they do see the wreckage,
there'll be nobody to signal to them.

825
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,060
They'll think there were no survivors
and give up the search.

826
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,689
That plane was on the same course
we were on--to Meiktila.

827
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:20,064
That's the way back home for us,
the way we're going.

828
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:23,263
Now will you stop teasing that shoulder
of yours and try to get some rest?

829
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:26,000
- Rest!
- Sure, you may need it.

830
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,271
As soon as it's dark, one of us
will have to go on to the river alone,

831
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,641
try to get help for the others.

832
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,943
And who will that be?
You, l suppose. You're the uninjured one.

833
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,813
And leave us to rot.

834
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,709
No, l was thinking
that you might like to go.

835
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,119
You can still walk all right.

836
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,623
l'll stay here
and take care of Carrington.

837
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,388
lt doesn't make much difference to me.

838
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,732
You think it over.

839
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,839
You never liked me,
did you, Forrester?

840
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,877
Not now, Blore.
There's a good fellow.

841
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,943
l know why.

842
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,684
lt's because l had something to live for,
a life to go back to.

843
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,817
l did some thinking last night.

844
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,021
lt's my having a wife
and family that you hated.

845
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,659
You need some sleep.

846
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,600
Somebody said once that in a crisis,

847
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:32,299
you could always depend on a man
of action to lose his head first.

848
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,571
l never thought l'd
see that proved up to the hilt.

849
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,237
Let's talk it over later.

850
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,210
l'm making a last appeal
to you, Forrester, for us all.

851
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,246
Carrington's wounded. He can't
think straight any more than you can.

852
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,588
We should never have left
the plane in the first place.

853
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,992
We've used up our strength uselessly.

854
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,428
As for going onward,
it's sheer madness.

855
01:18:56,498 --> 01:19:00,025
The only sane course now is to get back
to the plane as quickly as we can

856
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:03,162
and sweat it out
until the rescue party arrives.

857
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,531
Well?

858
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,204
Forrester?

859
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,101
Forrester.

860
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,035
Blore!

861
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,620
Blore!

862
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,740
What's the matter?

863
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,045
- Blore's gone.
- What do you mean?

864
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,641
Blore's gone.

865
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,746
Back to where we crashed,
l guess.

866
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:05,725
He's left some water in this
and walked off while we were asleep.

867
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,062
Maybe he's right, huh?

868
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,558
He's a clot and you know it.

869
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:16,471
Well, l'm gonna bring him back.

870
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,938
l'll make it as quick as l can.
You try to get some more sleep.

871
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:21,635
There's water if you need it.
Try not to.

872
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,974
l'll be back as soon as l can.

873
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,756
Blore!

874
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,406
Where's old Blore?

875
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,608
Decided not to come.

876
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,483
He's dead, isn't he?

877
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,222
Did he shoot himself?

878
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,488
Poor old Blore.

879
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,894
What do <i>you</i> know about it?

880
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:02,169
l only said poor old Blore.

881
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,676
Yeah.

882
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:05,110
Poor old Blore.

883
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,148
He could have been right, though,
don't you think?

884
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,581
No!

885
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:12,643
We're gonna get
out of here if we can--alive.

886
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:16,218
- You mean you are, don't you?
- l mean both of us.

887
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,722
l'm afraid it's no use,
my trying to walk.

888
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,785
Nobody's asking you to.
l'm gonna carry you.

889
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:26,658
How can you?
You'll never be able to do it.

890
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:29,498
lf l help you, do you think you
can manage to stand up on one leg?

891
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,840
l'll have a go.

892
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:39,570
But aren't you going to wait
until the sun's down?

893
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:42,138
We haven't got time for that.
l'm beginning to get hungry.

894
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:49,480
You all right?

895
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,260
Okay now?

896
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,358
- l think so.
- Hold on tight. Here we go.

897
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,729
Another 50 yards
and we'll take a rest.

898
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:08,733
Did you hear me?

899
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:11,894
Carrington.

900
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,836
Carrington!

901
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:16,573
Carrington!

902
01:30:18,646 --> 01:30:19,670
Sir?

903
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:24,446
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

904
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,652
We'll rest right up here.

905
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:01,419
l'm all right.

906
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:05,652
Sorry.

907
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,800
Time for a drink anyway.

908
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,723
That's almost the last
of the water, isn't it?

909
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:40,988
Almost.

910
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:44,921
- You had yours yet?
- No, l'll have it a little later.

911
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:50,699
Drink it now.
Let's see you.

912
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,070
All right.

913
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,122
How much left now?

914
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:21,624
That's the last.

915
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:26,767
About had it, haven't we?

916
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:29,704
Not yet.

917
01:32:29,777 --> 01:32:31,768
Pretty near, l'd say.

918
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:37,416
- You'd better go on.
- We'll both go on.

919
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:40,921
- You'll never get me out of here.
- Sure l will.

920
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:44,518
You're getting like old Blore.

921
01:32:45,993 --> 01:32:49,190
- Why?
- Well, face facts.

922
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:51,823
We can't go on without water.

923
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:57,336
lf you were by yourself,
you might get to the river,

924
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:58,895
fill that flask.

925
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:01,771
There might even be something
we could eat there.

926
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:04,504
Fruit, maybe.

927
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,274
Or even a nice juicy trout.

928
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,383
What's the watch for?

929
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,443
lt'll be dark
for a couple hours yet.

930
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,420
l might lose my bearings.

931
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,623
When it gets light, you fire a shot.
l'll be listening.

932
01:33:52,693 --> 01:33:56,720
After that, fire one
at hourly intervals.

933
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:00,493
Okay?

934
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:03,169
Okay.

935
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:15,681
lt's too bad
l don't have a fishing line.

936
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:19,376
l'll have breakfast
ready for you when you get back.

937
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:21,717
Just make mine toast and coffee.

938
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:51,531
The Lord be praised!

939
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:54,500
Yes. He reached the river all right.

940
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:57,264
He was picked up
by some Naga bearers.

941
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:59,738
He took him back with him
and got the navigator out.

942
01:37:59,807 --> 01:38:01,536
- Alive?
- Yes, but only just.

943
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:04,305
A few more hours,
it would have been too late.

944
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,812
Forward hospital are flying
them both in tomorrow.

945
01:38:07,815 --> 01:38:10,340
Anna said he would come back.

946
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,410
l didn't have faith enough.

947
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:49,587
- This is where l get out.
- Not too much talk, please, Mr. Forrester.

948
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:52,418
That's not fair, nurse.

949
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,754
Mr. Forrester and l...

950
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:57,694
got lots to talk about.

951
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,392
All right, Mr. Forrester,
that's enough.

952
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,942
Well, l'll be seeing you.

953
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:14,173
Yes, sir.

954
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:18,947
Thanks for the ride.

955
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:36,893
- Haven't we met before?
- The face seems familiar.

956
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:40,496
How about a nice jeep ride, Doc?

957
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:42,474
No nonsense now.
You're a sick man.

958
01:39:42,543 --> 01:39:44,909
- You're going to hospital.
- You know where l'm going.

959
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:48,245
l'll take all the salt
and mepacrine you want.

960
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,306
- Your eyes still ache?
- No.

961
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:52,750
Let's have a look at your tongue.

962
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:57,354
What an impossible man you are.

963
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:58,857
All right, get in.

964
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:25,783
Hello, Miss McNab.

965
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:33,585
Look at me,
crying like a loony.

966
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:35,822
Have you ever heard
of such a thing?

967
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:37,454
There, there.

968
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,525
Where's Anna?

969
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:45,731
She's in there.
Asleep, l think.

970
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:48,900
She hasn't slept at all
till she knew that you were safe.

971
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:54,177
- You can go in.
- Well, l oughtn't to wake her.

972
01:40:54,248 --> 01:40:56,648
There's no need to wake her.
