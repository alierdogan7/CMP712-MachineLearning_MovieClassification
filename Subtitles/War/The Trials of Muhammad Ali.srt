(SILENCE)

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,062
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

3
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,031
Well, now, with just a
slight skip of the heart,

4
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,666
we have, I think, got through
to Chicago and Muhammad Ali.

5
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,936
- Are you hearing us from London,
Muhammad? -<i> Yes, Sir. Loud and clear.</i>

6
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,273
- <i>How are you doing today? - Very
well. Thank you. Welcome to the show.</i>

7
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:46,645
<i>Thank you for allowing me to come to
you live by Early Bird satellite.</i>

8
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,815
Now, let me just get a few
facts straight with you.

9
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,618
You're a professional
fighter, right?

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,789
<i>I am a minister of the
religion of Islam also.</i>

11
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,824
A professional fighter
and a minister as well.

12
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:04,063
- <i>Yes, Sir. - David Susskind would
like to ask you some questions. David.</i>

13
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,431
Well, I don't know
where to begin.

14
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:11,003
I find nothing amusing or interesting
or tolerable about this man.

15
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,406
He's a disgrace to his
country, his race...

16
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,609
and what he laughingly
describes as his profession.

17
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,013
He is a convicted felon
in the United States.

18
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,515
He has been found guilty.

19
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,483
He is out on bail.

20
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,786
He will inevitably go to
prison, as well he should.

21
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,623
He's a simplistic
fool and a pawn.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,728
(MAN)
Muhammad Ali.

23
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,499
One of the greatest
athletes of all time.

24
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,903
As the first three-time heavyweight
boxing champion of the world,

25
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,040
he thrilled, entertained
and inspired us.

26
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,743
<i>(LOUIS FARRAKHAN) He was
given the Medal of Freedom...</i>

27
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,779
<i>by the president of
the United States.</i>

28
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,883
(PRESIDENT BUSH) The American people
are proud to call Muhammad Ali...

29
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,819
- one of our own.
- (APPLAUSE)

30
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:12,064
<i>(FARRAKHAN) What does it
mean, the Medal of Freedom?</i>

31
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,599
<i>We bring you up. Oh, yes.</i>

32
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:19,104
<i>This is Muhammad Ali, the great
fighter, the great humanitarian,</i>

33
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>the great Muslim.</i>

34
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,608
<i>Years ago,</i>

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,544
Ali came and sat right here.

36
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,413
And Ali looked at me.

37
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:33,318
He said, "Still a nigger."

38
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,755
I said, "Oh, Ali."

39
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,591
Don't talk like that."

40
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,795
He said, "Still a nigger."

41
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,400
What did my brother mean?

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,718
(APPLAUSE)

43
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,559
<i>(ALI) Olympic champion,
and the flag is going...</i>

44
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:17,529
(Humming
"Star-Spangled Banner")

45
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,798
<i>And I'm standing so proud.</i>

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,999
<i>I just hear the man say,</i>

47
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:25,737
"Champion of the whole world...
Cassius Clay."

48
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,240
(RAHAMAN)
Olympic champion of the world...

49
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,041
...from Kentucky.

50
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,811
Southern boy raised poor becoming
a gold medal winner, oh, man.

51
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,014
Oh! I still get excited.

52
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:41,153
Me, my mother, my father were
standing at the terminal

53
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,322
when he came off the plane.

54
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,723
I was so happy.

55
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,459
It was beautiful. Beautiful.

56
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,032
Any ideas now as to whom
you might sign with?

57
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,769
I would like to get with a nice,
honest crowd. Nice, clean people.

58
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,106
And with the right backing, I
believe I'll have a chance...

59
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,774
<i>to become the world's
heavyweight champion.</i>

60
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:07,846
It's best to be with somebody you know
and from your own town if possible.

61
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:18,924
I'm Gordon B. Davidson, attorney for
the Louisville Sponsoring Group,

62
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:25,063
owner of Cassius Clay and the hired hand to
keep the group and Cassius Clay together.

63
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,768
<i>(DAVIDSON) We had a contract
with Ali for six years.</i>

64
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,806
<i>We were as powerful a group as you
could put together in Louisville.</i>

65
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,776
These were all capitalists.

66
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:42,047
I'm Bill Faversham, vice
president of Brown-Foreman,

67
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,983
and one of the founders of
the group of Cassius Clay.

68
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,552
<i>I'm also his manager.</i>

69
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,989
I'm W.L. Lyons Brown,

70
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,660
chairman of the board of Brown-Foreman
Distillers Corporation.

71
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,062
I'm also a farmer and
in the oil business.

72
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,866
<i>(DAVIDSON) The original
group, they're all deceased.</i>

73
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,235
I'm the only survivor.

74
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,574
<i>The reason for the group was
to aid, assist and protect...</i>

75
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,844
<i>this fine Louisville athlete.</i>

76
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,815
<i>He was a young fellow
who wanted to be great.</i>

77
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,908
<i>(MAN) Cassius, you
say you're gonna be</i>

78
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,055
<i>champion by the time you're 21.
Is that right?</i>

79
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:28,193
As you know, today is the jet age.
Everybody's trying to break records.

80
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:32,297
<i>There's the man who says that
he'll be on the Moon by 1970.</i>

81
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,233
<i>They're gonna make cars
that will run by sunlight.</i>

82
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,003
Well, those are pretty
game predictions.

83
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,172
<i>I wouldn't want to do too
much bragging about it,</i>

84
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,631
<i>but everybody that watches
me, they say that.</i>

85
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:47,112
<i>I'm the greatest that
they've ever seen.</i>

86
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,615
<i>(DAVIDSON) But did I think he
would be the heavyweight champion?</i>

87
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,984
<i>I had doubts about it.</i>

88
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,753
And I think the group
had doubts about it...

89
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:58,357
because the odds, it's like
winning the Kentucky Derby.

90
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:02,361
<i>You have a horse, and the
horse looks pretty good,</i>

91
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,464
but it is gonna win the Derby?

92
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,667
<i>He never had a doubt about it.</i>

93
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:12,037
<i>For me to say it was
a civic thing...</i>

94
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,005
<i>...it was.</i>

95
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,710
This is the house behind us that
Muhammad and I were raised in...

96
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,880
<i>for the first 13
years of our life.</i>

97
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,921
<i>(MUHAMMAD ALI) Who's the champ?
I'm the champ.</i>

98
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,490
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>You come on.</i>

99
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,960
I was good, but he was
more gifted than I.

100
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,562
Left jab,

101
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,897
right cross,

102
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,332
hook.

103
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,904
<i>(RAHAMAN) And we shared a room together.
It had twin beds.</i>

104
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,739
<i>He had a bed on one
side on the room.</i>

105
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,041
I had a bed on the
side of the room.

106
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,414
<i>And from Mom, we got kindness,</i>

107
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,884
gentleness, sweetness
and affection, love.

108
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,386
All the good things from Mom.

109
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,790
My father, his name was
Cassius M. Clay Sr.

110
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,392
As I understand, I'm
Cassius Marcellus Clay Vi.

111
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,029
<i>Well, Cassius Marcellus Clay
is a great name in Kentucky.</i>

112
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,131
<i>(DAVIDSON)</i>
<i>Cassius Marcellus Clay...</i>

113
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,333
the old guy, the white guy,

114
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,836
<i>for whom Cassius was named...</i>

115
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,206
<i>he was a very strong
abolitionist.</i>

116
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:26,812
<i>I did talk to the Clays a lot.
Always a very friendly relationship.</i>

117
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:32,384
The father was kind of an
in-and-out sort of fellow...

118
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:37,255
<i>who painted signs and other
things for a living.</i>

119
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,994
(RAHAMAN) My father was painting
the churches here in Louisville.

120
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,647
My dad painted this
beautiful portrait of

121
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,650
Jesus Christ rescuing Peter.

122
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:10,856
Peter started denying to believe
in Christ and he started sinking.

123
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,858
<i>(ALI) When I went
to church on Sunday,</i>

124
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,092
<i>and I always asked my mother,</i>

125
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,894
<i>"How come is
everything white?"</i>

126
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,465
I said, "Why is Jesus white
with blond hair and blue eyes?"

127
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,633
<i>Angels are white."</i>

128
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,337
<i>I knew something was wrong,
but I couldn't pinpoint it.</i>

129
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:30,275
<i>(DAVIDSON) They had a lawyer
whose name was Alberta Jones.</i>

130
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:35,013
<i>She was an African-American
lawyer and a very good one.</i>

131
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:40,952
<i>He had little regard for money,
except he wanted to have it to spend.</i>

132
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,521
<i>When the group had him,</i>

133
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:48,193
<i>the top rate for
income tax was 91%.</i>

134
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,794
It's now 35.

135
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:55,901
So the more he made, the more
he paid to the government.

136
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,569
<i>To solve that problem,</i>

137
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,038
<i>the group paid for
everything...</i>

138
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,609
<i>so he could just
concentrate on his boxing.</i>

139
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,347
<i>(MAN) Cassius, do you
believe that a fighter...</i>

140
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,283
<i>actually tries to
kill another fighter?</i>

141
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,885
<i>Does he get that vicious?
Do you get that vicious?</i>

142
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,322
Every time I enter a ring,
I intend to down him.

143
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,490
And if he should
fall, he falls.

144
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:23,662
<i>Well, that's everybody's
intention or we wouldn't go in.</i>

145
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:32,070
We had a fund that we fondly jokingly
called "The Orange Juice Fund."

146
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,007
<i>When he was in Florida,
we would get the bills...</i>

147
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,444
<i>and they would be in
the range of, say,</i>

148
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,914
<i>2,000 gallons worth
of orange juice.</i>

149
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:48,753
And we knew that he wasn't drinking
2,000 gallons of orange juice.

150
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:54,125
<i>But the entourage managed to get
a little one way or another.</i>

151
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:58,163
We could not foresee the
difficulties that would lie ahead...

152
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:05,637
as far as military service and, of
course, the Muslim affiliation.

153
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,610
This is the corner where I
met Cassius Clay in 1961.

154
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:18,416
I'm standing on the corner of Second
Avenue and Sixth Street in Miami, Florida.

155
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,353
<i>I was selling the Muhammad
Speaks newspaper...</i>

156
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:24,923
<i>to propagate the
faith of Islam.</i>

157
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,527
<i>We tried to clean
our people up.</i>

158
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:35,934
<i>We were trying to be the best
citizens that American had.</i>

159
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,236
<i>People trying to be righteous.</i>

160
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,074
<i>We didn't smoke. We
didn't use drugs.</i>

161
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,144
<i>We respected our women.</i>

162
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:51,449
<i>We train our children to be the
same way. This is what he saw.</i>

163
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,952
Cassius Clay holler
across the street at me.

164
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:58,256
He say, "Hey, brother, why
are we called Negroes?"

165
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,392
Why are we called Negroes?

00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:45,843
(ABDUL RAHMAN MUHAMMAD) Cassius Clay
was training for the Sonny Liston fight.

328
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,012

329
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:51,415
I wanted him to be a
registered Muslim.

330
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,585
<i>When you come into Islam,
we write a letter...</i>

331
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,520
<i>saying we believe
in the teachings.</i>

332
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,056
<i>And we put our slave
name in the letter.</i>

333
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:03,761
Those were the names the slave master
had when they owned our ancestors.

334
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,931
<i>So he wrote his letter and
sent if off to Chicago...</i>

335
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:11,202
and then they sent back
what we called "X."

336
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,104
<i>He became Cassius X.</i>

337
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:20,044
<i>And then the promoters, they was trying
to get Ali to denounce the religion.</i>

338
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,212
<i>And they told Ali,</i>

339
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:25,049
"You got to get rid of
them Muslim kooks...

340
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,884

That's me...

341
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:30,021
"and denounce that religion, otherwise
there ain't gonna be no fight."

342
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,346
Well, Ali had been
training all his life for

343
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,692
a fight for the
heavyweight championship.

344
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,862

a man to death.

<i>I said, "Man, don't
believe that."</i>

I said, "Money's the
white man's God."

347
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,037
And I said, "You the only one who
can make any money for 'em."

348
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:46,837
I said, "Hold to your belief."

351
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,079

We ain't gonna say it neither."

<i>(CROWD CHEERING)</i>

Yes, Sir.

722
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:52,095
Members of the group went to various

723
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:58,001

<i>We felt that he would
be a Joe Louis.</i>

727

<i>Joe Louis served and
never carried a gun.</i>

728
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,448
<i>But he boxed, wore
the uniform...</i>

729
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,985
<i>and did a fine service
to his country.</i>

730
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,292
<i>(KHALIHAH) I got a
call and Ali said,</i>

"If I went to war, I would probably be in
one of them boxing things like Joe Louis.

I wouldn't be really
fighting in the war."

I says, "That's
not the point."

734
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:38,107
You have to understand that once
you sign your name to that army,

735
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,645

737
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:47,150
So just say hell no,

<i>A conscientious objector,
as a matter of law,</i>

753
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:02,625
was that if you believed that you should
not kill somebody or carry a weapon...

754
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:07,663
or participate in an activity
which would result in death,

807
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,503
Regardless of the ultimate
disposition of his case legally,

808
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:04,173
<i>he will no longer
be the champion.</i>

809
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:14,884
Well, now that they've taken Cassius Clay's
title away, do you think they should have?

810
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:17,687
Well, I don't know. I
think they should, yes.

811
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,623
I think that any man who don't
wanna fight for his country,

812
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,526
I don't think he should have
the honor of being champion.

813
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:24,293
The tragedy to me is...

814
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:29,532
that Cassius has made millions of
dollars off of the American public.

815
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:33,502
And now he's not willing
to show his appreciation.

816
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:35,071
<i>Hurts the morale of a lot of</i>

817
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:37,473
<i>young Negro soldiers
over in Vietnam.</i>

818
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,841
<i>(MAN) You won't fight
for your country?</i>

819
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,610
- You refuse to go into the...
- I'm a minister. My religion.

820
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,845
This country has
laws for ministers.

821
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,747
- <i>Are you an ordained minister?
- By my leader.</i>

822
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:49,885
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Almighty
God Allah fights battles for us.

823
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,822
We are forbidden to carry
anything like a weapon.

824
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,690
<i>We are peaceful people.</i>

825
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,459
<i>(MAN) Do you think
there's anything wrong...</i>

826
00:49:56,461 --> 00:50:00,896
<i>in someone like Cassius Clay,
Muhammad Ali, in refusing induction?</i>

827
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:01,898
Yes, Sir, I certainly do.

828
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,000
- Why? - 'Cause he's no
better than the rest of us.

829
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,302
I got a wife and three kids
I'd like to stay here with,

830
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:07,603
but if they need me,
I reckon I'll go.

831
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:10,439
Simply because Muhammad
Ali has these beliefs,

832
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:14,110
there's no reason why people
should go against him.

833
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,485
It took an all-white jury
less than a half hour...

834
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:26,889
to find Muhammad Ali guilty of
all charges and specifications.

835
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:30,826
He was sentenced to the maximum
five years in prison...

836
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:33,696
and was fined $10,000.

837
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:38,401
<i>(MUWAKKIL) To have a heavyweight
champion refuse to be inducted,</i>

838
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:39,502
that was almost blasphemous.

839
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:44,373
(MAN) This would mean, of course, that
you stand the chance of going to jail...

840
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,609
as a result of not
going into service.

841
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,910
Well, whatever the punishment,

842
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:52,281
whatever the persecution is for
standing up for my religious beliefs,

843
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,884
even if it mean facing
machine gun fire that day,

844
00:50:54,886 --> 00:51:00,689
I will face it before denouncing Elijah
Muhammad and the religion of Islam.

845
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,991
I'm ready to die.

846
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:06,896
<i>(KHALILAH) I was happy that this
black man, he actually stood up...</i>

847
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,365
and did what a
Muslim would do.

848
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:12,568
And that took a lot of balls.

849
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,739
<i>And he would come into my...</i>

850
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:21,544
<i>He would try to, you know... try
to get to me, but he couldn't.</i>

851
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,580
<i>And he would be trying
to look for me.</i>

852
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,349
<i>But by us having all
the white unis on,</i>

853
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,386
<i>he had to try to look at your
face because he couldn't tell.</i>

854
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,621
So he would always eye
at me in the mosque...

855
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,892
and keep his eyes and all that...
you know, flirting like.

856
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,929
<i>I knew he was mine.
He was mine then.</i>

857
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,932
<i>(ABDUL BEY MUHAMMAD) When I find
out that's who he was gonna Marry,</i>

858
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:43,566
<i>I jumped for Joy.</i>

859
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:47,770
<i>(ABDUL RAHMAN MUHAMMAD) It was a big
blessing to him. She was a virgin.</i>

860
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,672
To Marry a virgin...

861
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:55,411
I said, "Boy, you hit the
jackpot." That's what I told him.

862
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,512
And she was young and pretty.

863
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:03,085
Khalilah... one of a kind.
She's the female Muhammad Ali.

864
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,121
<i>Sweet, kind, good lady.</i>

865
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:09,358
He loved the fact that I stuck with
him when he didn't have anything.

866
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,827
<i>I tried to keep
everything positive...</i>

867
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,530
<i>and started a family, and
that was a good thing.</i>

868
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,932
- (CRYING)
- I'm not having no trouble out of you.

869
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,601
There ain't but one big
mouth in this family.

870
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,804
<i>(KHALILAH) I said, "Brother,
let me tell you something.</i>"

871
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:26,442
If you keep your body in shape and keep
your mind clear, you will win this fight."

872
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:30,179
The government fight has
cost nearly some $200,000...

873
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:34,016
plus my living expenses... my mother, my
father, my brother, my wife, my children.

874
00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:38,154
<i>(MAN) Boxing commissions around the
country wouldn't sanction his fights.</i>

875
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:42,558
I'm just about broke. I'm not allowed
to work here now in America.

876
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,693
I'm not allowed
to leave America.

877
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:47,463
Is there any chance
of you boxing?

878
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:48,964
I really don't know.

879
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,833
One day we might.
I'm not too sure.

880
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,803
<i>(MAN) I tried to get him
back into the ring...</i>

881
00:52:54,805 --> 00:53:00,075
and get governors to allow
him to fight in their state.

882
00:53:00,077 --> 00:53:02,878
<i>Alabama.</i>

883
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,079
<i>Utah.</i>

884
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,015
Jackson, Mississippi.

885
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:09,518
The white man told me to
get back on the airplane.

886
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,888
<i>I tried Alcatraz Island.</i>

887
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,791
<i>I tried every place
that I could think of.</i>

888
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:18,861
<i>(MAN) The only answer to the
beleaguerments of Muhammad Ali...</i>

889
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:23,866
<i>might be the stripped jet plane sailing
above all local jurisdictions...</i>

890
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,101
<i>with two fighters
and 200 fans.</i>

891
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:30,139
They had tried to put
a ring inside a 757.

892
00:53:30,141 --> 00:53:34,009
<i>(MAN) Wilt, there's been rumors that
you are ready to fight Cassius Clay.</i>

893
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:34,944
<i>Are any of these rumors true?</i>

894
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:37,947
<i>(CHAMBERLAIN) Actually fighting
Muhammad Ali was not a rumor.</i>

895
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:41,550
That was a plan. But right
now it's all down the drain.

896
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,387
We start doing the
speaking engagements.

897
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:50,059
<i>(LIPSYTE) That was the circuit
that really sustained him.</i>

898
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:50,993
<i>He got paid.</i>

899
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,863
<i>(ALI) Black and white are
opposite of one another.</i>

900
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:57,132
The opposite of good is bad.

901
00:53:57,134 --> 00:53:59,034
The opposite of hot is cold.

902
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:02,805
<i>(LIPSYTE) In the
beginning, he was terrible.</i>

903
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:05,774
And the opposite
of black is white.

904
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:08,244
He would go into Muslim dogma.

905
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:11,747
What is it that the
Muslims believe?

906
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:17,586
Number one, we're gonna say a few
things on what the Muslims want.

907
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,990
Remember, he was 12 years old...

908
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:23,759
when he committed
himself to boxing.

909
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:27,062
<i>Suddenly, you're in this
tunnel of your talent.</i>

910
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:32,868
<i>You just concentrate on being this
great boxer, which he became.</i>

911
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:37,373
<i>You wave through so many
of the tollbooths of life.</i>

912
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:43,279
<i>So now suddenly, it's 1967.</i>

913
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:46,482
<i>He has refused
to step forward.</i>

914
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,984
<i>He's 25 years old.</i>

915
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,689
<i>He's out on his own. He's
on college campuses.</i>

916
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:56,692
<i>He thought all these kids were
really smart kids out there.</i>

917
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,560
<i>They were going to ask him
really tough questions,</i>

918
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,729
<i>which, to a great
extent, they did.</i>

919
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:04,533
In time of peace, would you
allow yourself to be drafted?

920
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:07,503
- Would you?
- Yes, Sir.

921
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,104
Why?

922
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:13,642
Do you think that the United
States will eventually separate...

923
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,278
into two different
societies, black and white?

924
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,816
Well, the latest government
fact-finding committee...

925
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,285
said that this is what
it's coming to be...

926
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,554
and this is what it's
shaping up to be.

927
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,990
I'd like to ask you why
you're still a Muslim...

928
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:32,661
since it's a far-gone conclusion
that the Muslim... Muslims...

929
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,230
or two or three... I
don't know which...

930
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:37,800
did assassinate Malcolm X.

931
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,002
Anybody that'd
assassinate anybody...

932
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,938
or anybody that carry
weapons are not Muslims.

933
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,307
A Muslim wouldn't
carry a weapon,

934
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,142
and a Muslim wouldn't
assassinate nobody.

935
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:52,981
<i>(KHALILAH) Muslims have always been
under surveillance all our lives.</i>

936
00:55:53,464 --> 00:55:56,585
<i>You see, Elijah Muhammad has
taught us about Big Brother.</i>

937
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:58,887
<i>Brother Government was
always watching us...</i>

938
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:03,792
to find anything they can to
put these Muslims down or out.

939
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:07,463
They're there waiting
for that moment.

940
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:20,309
<i>(WINSTON) I did a lot
of those spots with Ali.</i>

941
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,878
He got exposure, being free.

942
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,416
And away from being coached,

943
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:31,220
I just watched him grow
up to become a man.

944
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:37,092
Well, I would say Black Power would be the
same thing to me that White Power is,

945
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,994
but leave out the brutality.

946
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,730
- (MURMURING)
- Like this is White Power...

947
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,734
your own schools, your
airports, your jet planes.

948
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:49,271
Being independent and not
dependent on others.

949
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:51,707
Building your own houses,
factories and hospitals.

950
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,482
I think that he's
teaching the black people

951
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,279
to hate white, and I
think that's very wrong.

952
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:59,848
I was opposed to his views
before he came here,

953
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,383
and I still am opposed
to his views...

954
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,118
because I feel if he
wants American rights,

955
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,887
then he should assume
responsibility of the draft.

956
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:08,323
<i>(KHALILAH) Somebody would
come out of nowhere...</i>

957
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:11,927
<i>and say, "You draft-dodger
nigger, go home."</i>

958
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,762
<i>Well, he didn't
like that at all.</i>

959
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,664
I said, "We have to do
this for a living, man."

960
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:19,268
<i>Don't worry about what people say
about you. You got to keep going."</i>

961
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,702
<i>And then he'd talk
back at me and says,</i>

962
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,972
<i>"You're not out there getting embarrassed.
I'm out there getting embarrassed.</i>

963
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:26,842
What would you do if
somebody did that to you?"

964
00:57:26,844 --> 00:57:29,912
I'm not gonna help nobody get
something that Negroes don't have.

965
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:33,015
If I'm gonna die, I'll die
now right here fighting you.

966
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:33,782
You my enemy.

<i>Metaphorically, Ali had one
foot and three toes in prison.</i>

1289
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:23,284
<i>The Chief justice assigned the
opinion to Justice Harlan.</i>

1290
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:28,856
<i>Justice Harlan... he was in very
good health, with one exception.</i>

1291
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:29,891
<i>His eyesight was horrible.</i>

1292
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:34,395
<i>He had had something that was
like a stroke of the eyes.</i>

1293
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:40,034
<i>Part of the job of being Justice
Harlan's law clerk was to read to him.</i>

1294
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,335
<i>And I told Justice Harlan...</i>

1295
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:43,938
I might have said it more times
than is really polite...

1296
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:48,175
<i>"When you go back and you read The
Message to the Blackman... ".</i>

1297
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,511
Every one of you should have
this book in your study.

"And you read The

1300
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:58,386
if Allah summons us to war,
then we will go to war.

1301
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:02,023
If you really took the
law literally seriously,

1302
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:07,361
<i>you cannot distinguish Jehovah's
Witnesses from the Nation of Islam...</i>

1303
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,263
<i>"on this particular issue."</i>

1304
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:12,333
<i>And so we've got
legal precedent.</i>

1305
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:16,938
<i>What the Supreme Court had said
about the Jehovah's Witnesses...</i>

1306

<i>was even though they're
willing to fight...</i>

1307
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:21,409
<i>in some hypothetical
war declared by God,</i>

1308
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:25,580
it doesn't mean that you're
not a conscientious objector.

1309
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:29,951
<i>Congress meant to exempt people
who, in good conscience,</i>

1310
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:36,157
<i>couldn't participate in a

ourselves to be righteous Muslims...

1320

out of the draft?

1322

<i>how awkward the

reverse Ali's conviction.</i>

1350

But this ground for reversal
applied only to Muhammad Ali.

It didn't apply to anybody else.

1352
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:18,919

<i>At the first stage
of this case,</i>

<i>that not only was Ali not

1358
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:36,737
Justice Douglas, at the very end of
the oral argument by the government,

1359
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:38,439
turned to the solicitor
general and said...

1360
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,542
(Justice William O. Douglas) "You
don't question his sincerity?"

1361
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:43,511
<i>No, Mr. Justice, we do not.</i>

1362
01:19:43,513 --> 01:19:46,113

<i>So the final outcome was

is so thin...

1372

<i>in his Muslim beliefs

1376
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:36,130
That overturns Ali's conviction
for refusing induction...

01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:38,165
and removes the threat
of five years in jail.

1378

When Ali heard the news, he
said, "Thanks be to Allah."

1379
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:43,537
I was on 79th Street
on the south side...

1380
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,872
and just bought me an
orange in a grocery store.

01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:49,109

me and hugged me with tears in his eyes...

01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:07,608
from the narrow view...

1448
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:11,712
of the Nation of Islam
in its infancy...

1449
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,782
to the broad universal view...

1450
01:24:14,784 --> 01:24:19,620
of Islam in its
fullest development.

1451
01:24:19,622 --> 01:24:21,555
That's Ali.

1452
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:24,324
<i>(ALI)</i>
<i>I'm a Muslim,</i>

1453
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:27,661
<i>and I'm against
killing, violence,</i>

1454
01:24:27,663 --> 01:24:31,265
<i>and all Muslims
are against it.</i>

1455
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:36,837
I think the people should know
the real truth about Islam.

1456
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:40,541
And I wouldn't be here
to represent Islam...

1457
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:44,078
if it was really like the
terrorists made it look.

1458
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,082
I think that all the people
should know the truth...

1459
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:55,255
and come to recognize the
truth because Islam is peace.

1460
01:24:55,557 --> 01:25:00,627
<i>(ABDUL RAHMAN MUHAMMAD) Ali... he
has made more people examine Islam.</i>

1461
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:03,831
And they find that Islam
ain't what the government...

1462
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:08,469
and the enemies of Islam
trying to make it out to be.

1463
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:10,003
<i>(MUWAKKIL)</i>
<i>Since 9/11,</i>

1464
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:14,775
Islam has acquired so many layers
and dimensions and textures.

1465
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,911
<i>When the Nation of Islam was
considered as a threatening religion,</i>

1466
01:25:17,913 --> 01:25:22,749
<i>traditional Islam was seen
as a gentle alternative.</i>

1467
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:25,686
- (CHANTING)
- <i> And now quite the contrary.</i>

1468
01:25:25,688 --> 01:25:28,989
<i>The Nation of Islam is seen
as a tame domestic version...</i>

1469
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:32,993
<i>and traditional Islam is seen
as the threatening thing.</i>

1470
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,096
<i>Muhammad Ali occupies a
weird kind of place...</i>

1471
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:40,534
<i>in that shifting
interpretation of Islam.</i>

1472
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:45,639
<i>(KHALILAH) He'll always be
the greatest fighter ever.</i>

1473
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,442
<i>But I just outgrew him.</i>

1474
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,747
My father's first marriage
was to Sonji Roi,

1475
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:56,950
<i>and it didn't last
long, about a year.</i>

1476
01:25:56,952 --> 01:26:00,354
<i>His second wife, he
had four kids with.</i>

1477
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,689
(MOUTHING WORDS)

1478
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:06,126
<i>His third wife, Veronica
Porsche, my mother,</i>

1479
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:09,096
he had myself and
my sister, Laila.

1480
01:26:09,098 --> 01:26:10,931
And his current wife, Lonnie,

1481
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:12,933
<i>they adopted
together one child.</i>

1482
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:16,837
<i>And my father has two children
by women he was not married to.</i>

1483
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,373
<i>So there's nine of us, and
we're one big happy family...</i>

1484
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:22,509
<i>'cause he brought us together
in the summers every year.</i>

1485
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:27,381
Probably drove my mother crazy and
everybody else crazy. We had a ball.

1486
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:33,020
<i>(KHALILAH) I see him at
certain family events.</i>

1487
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:35,522
<i>It hurts sometimes to
look at him too long.</i>

1488
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:40,360
I can be around for a few minutes
and then I have to walk away.

1489
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:44,565
<i>But then I see there's
a good Aura there.</i>

1490
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:47,668
Then I'll penetrate it
with some good memories.

1491
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:52,272
And then I fall in love
with him all over again.

1492
01:26:52,409 --> 01:26:55,209
<i>(ALI) All the wealth
of the universe...</i>

1493
01:26:55,211 --> 01:27:02,749
and all the wealth on Earth
is equal to mosquitoes...

1494
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:05,852
compared to what you
get in the next life.

1495
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:11,225
Some who know him believe that all those
blows to the head damaged his brain,

1496
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:14,628
that he is no longer
the man he was inside.

1497
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:18,131
<i>(HANA) He has Parkinson's,
as the world knows.</i>

1498
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:19,566
But he's healthy otherwise.

1499
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:23,804
He is happy being Muhammad Ali.
He enjoys who he is.

1500
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:24,905
<i>He's not in any pain.</i>

1501
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:27,741
<i>He believes that everything
has a purpose and a time.</i>

1502
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:30,611
<i>And, you know, he's...
he's happy.</i>

1503
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:33,981
When you do the right thing, man,
you will prevail at the end.

1504
01:27:33,983 --> 01:27:36,717
It's just a matter of you being
out there in the front...

1505
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,621
of the people who haven't
caught up with you yet.

1506
01:27:40,623 --> 01:27:42,923
(CHEERING)

1507
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:52,165
When he lit the
Olympic torch in '96,

1508
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:54,568
<i>I felt tears in my eyes.</i>

1509
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,838
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

1510
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,007
(APPLAUSE)

1511
01:28:00,009 --> 01:28:04,244
<i>(ANNOUNCER)</i>
<i>The greatest of all time!</i>

1512
01:28:04,246 --> 01:28:08,515
But to see him carry that,

1513
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:12,953
uh, it was a big-time howdy.

1514
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:16,223
It was a perfect
poetic moment.

1515
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:22,829
If anybody should've lit the
torch in any Olympic Games,

1516
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:26,533
<i>it should have
been Muhammad Ali.</i>

1517
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:28,568
<i>(LIPSYTE)</i>
<i>In the '60s and '70s,</i>

1518
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:33,674
<i>he was the most recognizable
face in the world.</i>

1519
01:28:33,676 --> 01:28:36,810
We created a symbol.

1520
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:43,550
<i>Muhammad Ali has long
since been supplanted...</i>

1521
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:47,621
<i>by what we believe he is.</i>

1522
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:50,157
One more time! Who's the
champ of the world?

1523
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,091
(AUDIENCE)
Muhammad Ali!

1524
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:54,161
<i>(LIPSYTE) There are so many
ways of looking at him...</i>

1525
01:28:54,163 --> 01:28:57,297
<i>that have only
to do with us...</i>

1526
01:28:57,299 --> 01:29:02,069
<i>and have nothing
to do with him.</i>

1527
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:07,574
When Muhammad Ali
took that stand...

1528
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:12,279
- That was a hell of a stand.
- It certainly was.

1529
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:15,649
<i>(HANA) And my father was
always more than a boxer.</i>

1530
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:17,951
To me, he's the eighth
wonder of the world.

1531
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,219
That's the one title
I'm waiting for.

1532
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:23,190
Muhammad Ali... the eighth
wonder of the world.

1533
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:30,197
<i>(RAHAMAN)</i>
<i>I love you, champ.</i>

1534
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,832
You're my soul and my heart.

1535
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:34,101
Only brother I got. Love you.

1536
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:38,038
I love you. Peace.
