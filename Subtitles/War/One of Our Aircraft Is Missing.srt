<i>From this and other operations,</i>

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,074
Pilot speaking, pilot speaking.

10
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,116

The target is Stuttgart,

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,878
<i>Will all operational crews</i>
<i>report to briefing at 1 4:30. 1 4:30.</i>

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,278

Halifax again.

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,118
- Oh, it's from my fiancée.
- Both of them? Have you got two?

25
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,156
The other's from Dad.

26
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,153
- Surely not the future Mrs Earnshaw?
- Whittaker & Whittaker, her dad's firm.

27
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,152
- Second best in Yorkshire.
- We know whose the best are.

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,038

29
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,790
Mm. l'm dying to see those two
noble animals in the same meadow.

30
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,632
You won't have to wait long.

31
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,313
Here comes Corbett,

33
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,874
- You coming on this party tonight?
- l'm on ops.

34
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,996
Hazel says don't forget tomorrow night.

35
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,753
(Both) Hazel Mason,
home and forces programme.

36
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,832
9:40. George, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

37
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,992
- Tomorrow? Packing.
- No, you're listening to my wife.

38
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,230
Home and Forces Programme.
Pack tonight.

39
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,276
l'm flying tonight.

40
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,318
- We didn't know you were on ops.
- l saw the group captain.

41
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,279
As it's my last night, he agreed to let me go.
Sorry to have gone over your head.

42
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,477
That's all right. Glad to have you with us.
Eh, fellas?

43
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,118
We're honoured, Sir George.

44
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,794
l suppose Hopkins has been
told about this switch.

45
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,758
- l suppose so.
- l'd like to see Hopkins' face, Frank.

46
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,957
Poor old Hopkins.
(American accent) Well, the son of a gun.

47
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,598
- Hopkins.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,353
Sorry, but you won't be wanted tonight.

49
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,431
- l see, sir.
- Bad luck, old man.

50
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,834
The son of a gun.

51
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,233
l don't believe it. Hey, he's pulling my leg.

52
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,993
lf you're not going,
can l have your silk stockings?

53
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,594
Oh, l suppose so.

54
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,194
What's this, camouflage net?

55
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,236
That's quality if it's a pair.

56
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,437
They keep you warm as toast.
lf my girl ever finds out l lent...

57
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,512
Tell her Bob Ashley wore them.
She'll be pleased as punch.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,273
<i>Boy, l wish you could have</i>
<i>seen that run of Welsh's,</i>

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,272
<i>a run worthy of</i>
<i>the great Bob Ashley himself.</i>

60
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,874
<i>lt had all the earmarks of an Ashley special.</i>

61
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,838
<i>So it's a free kick against the Allied Forces.</i>

62
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,070
Free kick. Now, look out for Welsh.

63
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,673
Not Welsh.

64
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,594
Not Welsh? Hear that, Len?
l'd like to see anybody else take it.

65
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,113
Course it'll be Welsh.

66
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,713
Compton will take the kick.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,237
<i>This is a tense moment. The ball is</i>
<i>on the spot. Welsh is going to kick.</i>

68
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,878
What did l say?

69
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,552
<i>Welsh is going to take the kick.</i>

70
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,675
Come on, Welsh!

71
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,036
<i>Welsh has kicked. No, he hasn't.</i>
<i>He's jumped over the ball.</i>

72
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,112
<i>Compton's taking the kick.</i>
<i>Compton's the man.</i>

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,714
<i>Goal! Well shot, Compton!</i>

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,756
<i>Well, that was a surprise.</i>

75
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,398
Not to me.

76
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,269
Cope with this indicator. lt's stuck again.

77
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,316
- l'll fix it.
- How's Bertie?

78
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,994
Perfect, sir. New coat, full stomach, a gent.

79
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,230
Fine. Bring the car back about four.

80
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
Did they fix that oil pressure, Jimmy?

81
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,031
Yes, it's OK now.

82
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,038
- Who's this bloke?
- Fan of yours, wants your autograph.

83
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,270
- Saw you in some play.
- That's right.

84
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,636
l saw you in the School For Scandal.
You played Joseph Surface.

85
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,278
Got a pencil?

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,510
- Afraid not.
- l'll do it for you tomorrow.

87
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
- Thanks.
- lt was Charles Surface.

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,549
Fairpath calling T for Tommy, T for Tommy.

89
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,076
lt's now 21 :35, 21 :35. You may take off.

90
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,274
Checking intercoms. Bob, are you there?

91
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,312
Sergeant Ashley, sir, receiving you all right.

92
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,589
Blasted beehive gets smaller every trip.

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,873
What are you grumbling about, Sir George?
You've got a carriage to yourself.

94
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,077
Fairpath calling.
Q for Queenie, Q for Queenie.

95
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,835
21 :37, 21 :37. You may take off now.

96
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,591
Check your watches, chaps.

97
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,832
ln 50 seconds, it'll be 21 :40.

98
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,878
ln...45 seconds.

99
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,237
ln...40 seconds.

100
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,994
Fairpath calling B for Bertie, B for Bertie.

101
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,230
lt is now 21 :40, 21 :40.

102
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,912
Off you go.

103
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,958
Geoff, OK to go forward.

104
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,792
OK, Skipper.

105
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,352
Stuttgart, here we come.

106
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,109
You know, l played in Stuttgart
with my club in er...1938.

107
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,714
1938...l was playing in New York.

108
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,076
- What's Stuttgart like?
- Oh, like all those continental towns.

109
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,674
Played Saturday, Sunday,
Monday on the train.

110
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,398
That was Stuttgart. Well, well.

111
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,359
- Nice girls in Stuttgart, Skipper.
- Well, one anyway.

112
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,670
What do you know about
the girls in Stuttgart?

113
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,478
l know a nurse from Stuttgart.

114
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,278
That's funny. Mine was a nurse.

115
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,918
<i>Was her name Liesel?</i>

116
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,150
No, Else. What was your nurse like?

117
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,390
Oh, she was a big blonde job.

118
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,997
Couldn't half cook too.
She worked for a doctor in Gerrards Cross.

119
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,153
Used to sing that song,
er...l Kiss Your Little Hand Madame.

120
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,713
That's right and, of course,
she used to sing it in German, you know?

121
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,116
<i>She was always singing it, l suppose, cos</i>
<i>she wasn't allowed to sing it in Germany.</i>

122
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,156
<i>The composer was a Jew, l believe.</i>

123
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,277
What was your nurse like, Skipper?

124
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,669
Else? She was blonde too.

125
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,194
- <i>Was she a good cook?</i>
- She was good at everything.

126
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,793
My next nurse wasn't so good.

127
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,235
You seem to specialise in nurses, Skipper.

128
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,073
Well, l did then. l was only two, you see.

129
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,717
- Had you there.
- l'd seen snaps of her in my father's album.

130
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,756
He was on the reparations commission.

131
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,991
Stuttgart was capital of Württemberg,
once a kingdom on its own.

132
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,108
That's right. The biggest paper there
is called the Württemberger Zeitung.

133
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,430
Liesel used to read it to me out loud.

134
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,676
Over Dutch coast.

135
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,508
Geoff, George, look out for fighters.

136
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,035
lf my course is right,
we'll be getting some flak soon.

137
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,398
(Anti-aircraft fire)

138
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,789
Your course seems all right, Frank.

139
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,795
- Cologne's just come off the air.
- l don't blame her.

140
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,830
Railroad ahead.

141
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,635
Got it. Main line to Cologne.

142
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,951
l've travelled on that line
and l was going to Stuttgart.

143
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,438
Mannheim on our right.

144
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,238
Tom, give them some leaflets.

145
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,878
Okey-doke.

146
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,593
Give them the Ashley special.

147
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,429
(Booming)

148
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,998
lt's good for you.

149
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,074
Hold the course, John, over River Neckar.

150
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,874
John, do you see what l see?

151
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,436
Big fire, dead ahead.

152
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,952
We're in the wrong end, John.

153
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,792
(Anti-aircraft fire)

154
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,914
- Can l have a smack at the searchlight?
- OK, give it a squirt or two.

155
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,838
(Machine-gun fire)

156
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,434
Can l have a go too, Skipper?
No favouritism.

157
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,078
<i>OK.</i>

158
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,711
(Machine-gun fire)

159
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,192
Now who's in the wrong end?

160
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,958
What's that fire?

161
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,070
Bet that's Queenie on the job.

162
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,191
And that'll be Tommy.

163
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,596
All right, do another circuit.

164
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,751
Bomb doors.

165
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,076
Bomb doors open.

166
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,789
- OK, let's go down.
- Going down.

167
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,191
4,000.

168
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,633
3,600.

169
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,472
Level out.

170
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,236
Steady.

171
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,276
Left, left.

172
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,918
Steady.

173
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,355
All bombs gone.

174
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,754
Shall l transmit, sir, mission completed?

175
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,069
Crikey!

176
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,912
How about it, Tom?

177
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,309
Starboard engine's packed up.
Port's all right.

178
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,232
Hello, Bob. lntercoms working?

179
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,669
Yes, sir, radio's dead though.

180
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,354
George, everything organised?

181
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,750
- <i>You may get your hands full.</i>
- All right, Skipper.

182
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,035
We'll sort 'em out, won't we, George?

183
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,519
How about it, Bob?

184
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,275
Completely cheese, sir, all tubes blown.

185
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,233
- How about cut out the corners, Frank?
- All set. Shortest route over Mainz.

186
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,878
Alter course to 301 , Johnny.

187
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,077
Bob, destroy your code signals.

188
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,116
l have, sir. They taste filthy.

189
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,718
Speed still dropping, only 90 now.

190
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,394
l'll try a steep dive. Hang on, everybody.

191
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,077
lt's no use, chaps.
We'll have to stooge home on one engine.

192
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,311
At this rate, she may stall any minute.

193
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,994
- Shall l get out and push?
- <i>Where are we, Frank?</i>

194
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,674
Over Holland. Amersfoot.
Can you see a railroad?

195
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,030
l'm not sure. How about you, Tom?

196
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,319
Yes, l think so.

197
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,960
That's the main line
from Amersfoot to Hilversum.

198
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,349
Blast! That's both engines packed up now.

199
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,630
(Engine splutters)

200
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,516
We'll have to jump for it, boys.

201
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,352
- Geoff. George.
- <i>(Both) Sir.</i>

202
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,351
- Frank. Bob. Tom.
- <i>OK.</i>

203
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,238
- <i>l'm here.</i>
- Stand by to abandon aircraft.

204
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,632
Shall we chance it together or go solo?

205
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,472
- Together.
- <i>How?</i>

206
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,358
Bail out along the railroad,
Skipper's last to leave.

207
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,274
lf we all follow the railroad northwest,
we're bound to find each other.

208
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,834
Tom, jump.

209
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,795
Frank, jump.

210
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,155
Geoff, jump.

211
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,438
George, jump.

212
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,115
Bob, jump.

213
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,116
(Engine splutters)

214
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,036
(Engine picks up)

215
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,232
(Birdsong)

216
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,157
- (George) What can you see?
- The Zuider Zee.

217
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,992
Anything else?

218
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,638
Windmills.

219
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,631
Any soldiers?

220
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,877
- No.
- What's the country like? Can you see far?

221
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,319
Yes, miles. Very flat.

222
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,278
What did you expect,
the mountains of Mourne?

223
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,836
No sign of him, then?

224
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,831
The Zuider Zee's no good to us.

225
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,638
How far is it to the North Sea?

226
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,870
- About 38 miles.
- That's not so bad.

227
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,033
- lt's 38 miles too far in this make-up.
- Clothes are the first thing to organise.

228
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,429
- Then there's Bob.
- lt's too bad about Bob.

229
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,318
- l'd rather it'd been John or Frank.
- Oh, would you?

230
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,550
- No offence.
- Anyone got a cigarette?

231
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,998
l haven't. You have lived abroad, Skipper,
and they reckon Frank's a first-class actor.

232
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,479
Sorry, last one.

233
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,473
A football pro is used to travelling with
his team. Bob'll get lost on his own.

234
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,869
Let's face it. He is lost.

235
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,436
We want to watch things like that.

236
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,431
And we'd better keep down too.

237
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,476
Bob might turn up here.

238
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,233
Well, he's three hours overdue.
Got a match?

239
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,390
We've wasted enough time already.

240
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,756
John, you command in the air.
You should command on the ground.

241
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,434
Why should anyone command?
Let's all have a say.

242
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,114
- That won't work.
- l take John's view.

243
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,156
Very well. What do you suggest?

244
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,149
Well...the first thing
we've got to do is to find Bob, obviously.

245
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,992
We can't let him down.

246
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,709
And then... Well, then
we make a plan of campaign.

247
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,789
Decide what to do and what not to do.

248
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,433
- Don't you agree, Tom?
- Hm.

249
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,308
Then er...well, act accordingly.

250
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,799
Very explicit.

251
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,598
Clear as mud.

252
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,989
- Here, come on down.
- l must say, Frank...

253
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,629
Now, listen, l've been lost dozens of times.

254
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,314
Sometimes alone,
sometimes with a regiment,

255
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,837
so l know this much, either we separate
here and now and it's each man for himself,

256
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,196
or we stick together
and somebody must command.

257
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,038
- Who's for separating?
- What are you for yourself?

258
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,872
l'll put another question.

259
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,474
Do we surrender
or do we try and get back home?

260
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,350
- Well, what do you think?
- Frank, you're navigator. Where are we?

261
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,754
l'd say somewhere...somewhere here.

262
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,554
There's Hilversum to the west,
Amsterdam and the Zuider Zee up there.

263
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,757
Now, we want to aim at a spot
somewhere south of Haarlem,

264
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,914
between Zandvoort and Katwijk...
but there's several main roads

265
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,558
and it's swarming with people.

266
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,950
- What's ''polder'' mean?
- Land that's reclaimed. Dykes and dams.

267
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,830
lt's nearly all polder country
south of Haarlem. Tulip fields.

268
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,072
Pity about that, l like a nice tulip.
What are we going to do about our clothes?

269
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,469
We've got to get into civvies somehow.

270
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,471
Well, what's George doing?

271
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,830
- Going swimming in the canal.
- How do you know there is one?

272
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,710
There's always a canal in Holland. The next
best thing to civilian clothes is to have none.

273
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,553
l'll be a swimming Dutchman
and spy out the land.

274
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,154
- Suppose you meet a Dutchman.
- l'll use gestures.

275
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,549
- Suppose it's a girl.
- Can you speak Dutch?

276
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,993
- No.
- Well, l can.

277
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,753
- Well?
- Well enough. Diplomat's Dutch.

278
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,956
l think you're going to be
the swimming Dutchman, my lad.

279
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,634
Shh. Somebody coming, l think.

280
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,912
Vicky! Vicky!

281
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,752
(Pig squeals)

282
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,398
Vicky! Vicky!

283
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,233
(Speak Dutch)

284
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,872
Vicky! Vicky!

285
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,678
That dog spots us, we're jiggered.

286
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,228
(Girl) Willem! Willem!

287
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,629
(Speaks Dutch)

288
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,029
(All) Vicky!

289
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,876
- (Barks)
- Lie down. Get!

290
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,951
Shut up. Shut up.

291
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,350
- (Continues barking)
- Vicky! Vicky!

292
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,590
Willem! Willem!

293
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,875
Maartie! Vicky!

294
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,791
Vicky! Vicky!

295
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,950
- (All) Vicky!
- (Barking)

296
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,389
(Speaks Dutch)

297
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,910
(Speaks haltingly)
Niet...afraid...zijn. Niet rennen weg.

298
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,394
lk vrienden. Engels.

299
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,190
RAF. R-A-F.

300
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,794
R-A-F. R-A-F.

301
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,476
Royal Air Force!

302
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,836
Ja. Royal Air Force. Ben jij een vriend?

303
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,990
Allebjij vrienden.

304
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,833
- He says they're friends.
- Let's go and talk to them.

305
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,478
l hope they don't scram.

306
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,391
(Speaks Dutch)

307
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,516
He asked if we've come to invade Holland.

308
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,352
(Laughs) What with?

309
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,318
Hello.

310
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,230
Hello, young fella.
We jumped out of our aeroplane.

311
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,038
Bailed out.

312
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,669
One, two, three, four...

313
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,073
five, six allez.

314
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,559
Six disparu.

315
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,949
- That's French.
- Well?

316
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,032
Johnny, over to you, over.

317
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,434
(Speaks haltingly) Er... Verloren...lost,
een cameraad, hier ergens.

318
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,238
Heb je hem niet gezien?

319
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,758
Hoe... Your names?

320
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,831
Willem, Maartie.

321
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,070
- Jannie.
- Hendrik.

322
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,718
Jan.

323
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,358
Tom.

324
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,793
Geoff.

325
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,189
Frank. George.

326
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,910
(Speaks Dutch)

327
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,869
- Ja. lk begrijp.
- What's this safety pin gag?

328
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,315
lt's a sign against Germans and quislings.

329
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,154
A safety pin means keep together.
Keep your mouth shut.

330
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,994
(Speaks Dutch)

331
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,834
There's someone at the farm
who speaks English. Her name is Els...

332
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,878
Els...Els Meertens. Els Meertens.

333
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,518
Els Meertens.

334
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,194
- Zij is schooljuffrouw.
- She's a schoolmarm.

335
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,952
Sounds a useful old bird.

336
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,632
ls dit invasie van Holland?

337
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,078
No, young fellow, we have not
come to invade Holland...yet.

338
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,116
l know that much Dutch already.

339
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,948
(Excited chattering)

340
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,109
Kind of a debate going on in there, l think.

341
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,278
(Speaks excitedly in Dutch)

342
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,269
Miss Meertens.

343
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,750
l'll never put a ferret down
a rabbit hole again, l know that.

344
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,389
lt's quite stuffy in here,
as if it might be a trap.

345
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,391
l'm not so sure it isn't.

346
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,116
Must be 20 of them, talking for half an hour.
What about? That's what l'd like to know.

347
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,509
Fetching Germans.
l wouldn't put it past 'em.

348
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,909
- l would.
- You would? Why?

349
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,549
l've been watching the road
ever since we got here.

350
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,835
No one's left the house.

351
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,672
Shh.

352
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,516
(Chattering stops)

353
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,078
Sorry, gentlemen, to have kept you waiting.

354
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,914
l am Els Meertens,
schoolteacher from Emmen.

355
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,919
How do you do, Miss Meertens?
My name is John Glyn Haggard and these...

356
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,754
The identities of all five of you are
of the greatest importance to us

357
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,071
but if you don't mind,
we prefer to check them for ourselves.

358
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,073
Excuse me, Miss Meertens, how do you
propose to find out if we don't tell you?

359
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,789
l see you wear an identity bracelet.

360
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,150
l'm sure you can tell me your friend's name.

361
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,798
Well? Can you or can't you?

362
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,198
- Of course. l've known him a long time.
- l didn't ask how long you had known him.

363
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,998
What is his name?

364
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,833
He's Mr Tom Earnshaw,
our second pilot, of course.

365
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,996
Right.

366
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,309
- You jumped out of your aeroplane, why?
- We didn't want to crash with it.

367
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,152
- Where did it crash?
- lt didn't.

368
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,677
- The engine picked up after we bailed out.
- l don't know very much about aeroplanes.

369
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,877
But that means you can't prove
your aircraft has crashed.

370
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,678
lt might have gone on for miles.

371
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,877
Would it surprise you to know
that so far as is known

372
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,838
no aircraft has crashed in West Holland
during the night?

373
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,989
l suppose Bertie
could have reached the sea.

374
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,231
- What do you say, John?
- Don't ask me. Your witness.

375
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,629
- Where are your parachutes?
- We buried them.

376
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,234
- All five?
- Five are all we know about.

377
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,471
- What do you mean by that?
- There were six in my crew.

378
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,710
You are captain?

379
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,199
Yes.

380
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,556
- Where is the sixth man?
- l don't know. We never found him.

381
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,428
l see. And where did you
bury your parachutes?

382
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,114
- Look here, l've had enough of...
- You don't know?

383
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,192
Of course l know.
Along the railroad where we landed.

384
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,832
Can any of you prove beyond reasonable
doubt that you are what you say you are?

385
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,070
l'll be jiggered. l've never heard such a thing.

386
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,594
- But our uniforms...
- Prove nothing.

387
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,592
- Why not?
- Anybody could get a uniform.

388
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,708
lf some people were anxious to find out how
we were to behave towards English airmen,

389
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,109
wouldn't that be the simplest way?

390
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,637
You mean you think we've come here
to get you to give yourselves away?

391
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,269
But we're English. We wouldn't
do a thing like that, would we, Frank?

392
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,316
You're not so sure about the others?

393
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,233
What are you trying to make me say?
Of course l'm sure.

394
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,630
What is the name of this gentleman?

395
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,836
- Go on, George.
- This is Frank Shelley. He's an actor.

396
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,876
And his wife is to broadcast tonight.

397
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,554
(All) 9:40, home and forces programme.

398
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,790
Frank, contrary to mess regulations,

399
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,872
l saw you tearing a piece out of the Times.
You got it on you?

400
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,758
l think that's the sort of proof
Miss Meertens wants.

401
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,592
Here you are.

402
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,070
''Broadcasting, home and forces
programme, Sunday 9:40...''

403
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,709
That's tonight.
''Hazel Mason...'' That's my wife.

404
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,554
There's the date
and there's the date on the newspaper.

405
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,070
Yes, this is yesterday's Times.

406
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,116
Your witness.

407
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,112
Does that satisfy you, Miss Meertens?

408
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,952
lt will do, l think.

409
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,190
l'm going to show it to the others.

410
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,874
You're not the only one
that had their doubts.

411
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,435
Not the only one?

412
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,557
No, there's nothing to stop you
sending for the Nazis.

413
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,870
l thought airmen had
better eyesight than that.

414
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,712
- What a girl.
- As you say.

415
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,156
- She shot you down in flames.
- What did she mean about our eyesight?

416
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,357
- Something we missed in this room.
- Let's find it.

417
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,557
- Orange blossom.
- What's orange blossom got do with it?

418
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,189
That's their Oranje altar, Orange altar,
to honour Queen Wilhemina.

419
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,633
(Geoff) But why Orange?

420
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,110
(Tom) William of Orange,
the House of Orange, shows they're loyal.

421
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,998
There should be a picture of the queen too.

422
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,236
There is.

423
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,312
Quite foxy. That Els Meertens, what a girl.

424
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,473
- We heard you the first time.
- Gentlemen, won't you come in?

425
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,512
Thank you.

426
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,194
Pieter Sluys, your host, gentlemen.

427
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,069
(Speaks Dutch)

428
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,836
Come on, John.

429
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,357
(Clears throat and speaks Dutch haltingly)

430
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,638
(People laugh softly)

431
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,110
(People laugh good-humouredly)

432
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,710
l always thought speeches
came at the end of a meal.

433
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,598
Wouldn't mind a little bit
of that ham anyway.

434
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,070
(Speak Dutch)

435
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,197
- (Els) Won't you sit down, please?
- Thank you.

436
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,992
This is very good of you
but aren't you short of food?

437
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,197
Sometimes but don't worry,
we have enough for our friends.

438
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,034
(Speaks Dutch)

439
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,510
He says, ''Don't worry, eat him.
He was a quisling pig.''

440
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,992
(Speaks Dutch)

441
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,071
- Thank you.
- Erg lekker.

442
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,553
Thank you.

443
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,310
Gesundheit.

444
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,878
Very nice.

445
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,874
We are worried about
your comrade who is lost.

446
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,758
So are we, miss.
Bob's brains are in his feet.

447
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,718
- ln his feet?
- Bob's a football player. A very good one.

448
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,153
But not very bright.

449
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,754
Still it's a pity his brains are not in his head.

450
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,832
lf he's found, the Germans
are going to look for you five.

451
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,754
Burying the parachutes was a mistake.
Freshly-dug earth will be examined.

452
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,354
- Can't we send someone to dig them up?
- We have.

453
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,238
And we will hide them,
this time in a safer place.

454
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,312
You know, young lady,
you've got your head screwed on.

455
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,152
Thank you.

456
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,196
The main thing is your escape.

457
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,794
- Any ideas?
- You agree that we can escape?

458
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,791
Others have done it. Why not you?

459
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,438
First we must get to the sea.

460
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,476
The sea is 58 kilometres away

461
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,633
and every village has its German post
and every road is patrolled.

462
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,632
- First we must get you to church.
- Why church?

463
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,269
Our church is ten kilometres west of here.

464
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,989
Ten kilometres nearer the North Sea.
You must go at once.

465
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,514
Excuse me, Miss Meertens,
what is your church?

466
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,750
We are Catholics.

467
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,839
l'm chapel.

468
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,959
So am l.

469
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,439
What is chapel?

470
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,114
- lndependent Methodist.
- Baptist.

471
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,760
Those are your English Reform churches?

472
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,398
That's it.

473
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,918
(Els) But it's our only plan.

474
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,309
lf this gets back to Halifax,
l shall never hear the last of it.

475
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,238
We will dress you in Dutch clothes.
Nobody will know.

476
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,276
(Tom) You don't know chapel folk.

477
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,750
But surely your escape
is the most important thing.

478
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,716
End justifies the means, Tom.

479
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,237
That's settled. Would it be safer to travel
at night? We'd be at the coast in three days.

480
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,393
By our plan, you will be at the coast tonight.
Jo will be waiting for you.

481
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,879
Jo? Who's Jo?

482
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,474
Jo de Vries, the wife of Hendrik de Vries.

483
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,312
Oh? Who's Hendrik de Vries?

484
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,473
Hendrik de Vries was killed by the British
in the mass air attacks on Haarlem.

485
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,155
Since then his wife hates the British
more than anything in the world.

486
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,630
A very good choice for a hostess.
What is this, a conundrum?

487
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,474
- l never heard that we bombed Haarlem.
- The Germans want us to believe it.

488
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,869
So Jo de Vries obliges them.

489
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,714
They like her because
they believe she hates the British.

490
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,951
That is what she wants,
so everyone is happy.

491
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,598
Oh, l see, a bit of camouflage.

492
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,231
Yes. We have our own ways
of managing things. Did you hear our motto?

493
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,198
(Speaks Dutch)

494
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,599
No?

495
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,913
lt means the sea's a common enemy and
against a common enemy one must unite.

496
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,353
Do you think we Hollanders

497
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,513
who threw the sea out of our country
will let the Germans have it?

498
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,511
Better the sea.

499
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,114
- (Speaks Dutch)
- Can you all ride a bicycle?

500
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,798
Well, l'm not much of a hand
at a bike myself. l never was.

501
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,792
We will find a way
but first we must find you all clothes.

502
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,031
Better keep our uniforms on,
gives us a chance if we're caught.

503
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,429
(Els) You can wear
your disguises over them.

504
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,990
lf we're going to be pushing off,
l would like more ham, Mother.

505
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,991
Ham, natuurlijk.

506
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,959
Talking of ham, Frank, this is your big
chance. What disguise will you wear?

You're going to see a series of perfect
Dutch character sketches, real little cameos

Halifax High Street in a pair of these, Tom.

515

''From clogs to clogs in three generations.''

516
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,474
l never hoped to co-star with the great
Francis Shelley in a Dutch epic.

517
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,317
Now, George, you're doing quite well, really,
quite well, but...co-star? Really.

518

a tearing hurry for on a Sunday morning.

528
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,399

Germans found one of your parachutes.

533
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,469
But you dug them up.
l thought they were safe.

534
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,710
They are. Very safe.

535
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,756
Then it must be another one.

536
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,518
George.

537
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,717
The Jerries have found
another parachute. lt must be Bob's.

538
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,156
- Found Bob's parachute.
- Bob's parachute's found.

539
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,390

in the neighbourhood.

542
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,073
So long as they don't find
our parachutes, we're safe.

543

- Where are they hidden?
- Where are they hidden?

544
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,398
Where are they hidden?

545

a man of my village but it is true.

590

to fraternise with the soldiers at the post

- Dare? Huh, you're kept.

617

the men we're looking for.

618

- You're risking your head.
- lt's nothing to do with him.

619
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,358
- He'll be shot before he can prove it.
- Talking of shooting...

620
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,192
You wouldn't dare fire here.

621
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,992

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

632
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,471
Perhaps it's not so strange.

633

634
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,310
(Van Dieren laughs)

635
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,949
Yes, but l do. Your German friends
at the post asked you to send them

636
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,190
some gramophone records, didn't they?

637
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,829
And you chose my son for the honour
of carrying them, didn't you?

638
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,832
And you gave him a quarter
for doing it, didn't you?

639
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,908
Ah. My son... Well, he changed
all your records for ours

640
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,594

some good ones too, trust him.

all pasted on so the Germans
wouldn't know what they were.

645
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,996

(All) De Jong!

649
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,314
They won't think it's me. Why should they?

650
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,755
Why shouldn't they?
lf l was a German, l'd say,

651
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,513
''De Jong sent records.
He didn't bring them himself.

''They turned out to be the Dutch anthem.
Very funny joke. Let's look for de Jong.''

653
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,674
And there they go, looking,
with fixed bayonets.

654
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,836
Your move, mah jong.

655
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,913
- They'll believe me if l tell the truth.
- You'll be shot before you can prove it.

656
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,629
- Shot? They can't shoot me.
- Can and will.

657
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,840
Well, it really doesn't matter. Either
we shoot you now, or they shoot you later.

658
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,037
Shot? l won't be shot!

659
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,433
Father...help me! Tell me what to do! They'll
be after me if they don't find me at home.

660
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,275
Evidently you know your friends. You don't
think they'll believe you if you tell the truth.

661
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,669
They believe everyone wants to kill them.

662
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,877
They will shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

663
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,114
You are a servant of God!
You can't let them kill me!

664
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,320
You expect God to help you escape but l
think you were meant to fall into our hands.

01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,155
- That would cause trouble.
- lt would that.

677
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,118
- Many people might be killed or injured.
- On both sides.

678
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,990
ln Holland, we've found a new system.
lf 50 are ordered to go, we all go.

679
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,832
Come along.

680
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,157
- That's playing their game.
- You don't understand Germans.

681
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,994
They have orderly minds.
lf they say 50, they mean 50.

682
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,479
<i>Achtung! Achtung!</i>

683
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,710
(Announcement in German)

684
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,114
''As you were, it is equally forbidden
that everybody should leave.

685
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,751
''Cancel the previous order
and continue to enjoy the game, please.''

686
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,596
Jerry seems a bit flustered.

687
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,756
Now we get on with the football.

688
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,239
(Whistle)

689
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,072
(Whistle and applause)

690
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,195
There you are, you see? Dead easy.

691
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,478
Bob Ashley.

692
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,515
There's Bob!

693
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,629
- lt is Bob!
- Well, l'll be jiggered.

694
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,436
Hurray! What's he Dutch for hurray?

695
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,829
- Hurrah.
- (All) Hurrah!

696
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,234
(Man reads hesitatingly in German)

697
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,430
(Low chattering)

698
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,794
You strolled around
with your hands in your pockets

699
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,030
speaking English
and pushing men in canals.

700
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,669
- They shouldn't have got in a flap.
- You left your parachute in a canal.

701
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,309
lt was time to get cracking.
l came back later but l couldn't find it.

702
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,356
- The Germans had it by then.
- Did they?

703
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,194
l don't understand how you could
walk along without Geoff spotting you.

704
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,239
- l don't either. Perhaps he was asleep.
- (Geoff) l certainly wasn't.

705
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,470
Did you see a train about 6:30?

706
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,074
Oh, yes, sir, it overtook me. l hid.

707
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,310
Overtook you?

708
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,520
You were walking the wrong way, my lad,
walking into Germany instead of England.

709
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,909
- Then you met a shepherd.
- Whose dog bit you.

710
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,879
Then they took me to the village
where the schoolteacher spoke English.

711
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,714
- Schoolteacher? What was she like?
- OK. That's where l had me breakfast.

712
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,553
And then they passed you along
by barge and ox cart...

713
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,198
- Bicycle.
- And what have you.

714
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,158
..until you find yourself
on the way to a football match.

715
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,151
And they said, ''Good gracious''.

716
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:35,074
They told me a truck would take me
after the game to some man called Joe...

717
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,233
Not Joe, Jo. lt's a woman, not a man,
otherwise you're all right.

718
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,629
Her name is Jo de Vries.

719
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,278
Half a minute.

720
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,470
(Sniffs)

721
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,313
- l smell the sea.
- The North Sea.

722
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,156
(Distant bugle)

723
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,798
- Hear that?
- German.

724
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,872
- How do you know?
- Heard 'em often enough in the last war.

725
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,831
(Distant bugle)

726
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,034
Hope Mrs de Vries
has her weather eye open.

727
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,990
(Shouts in German)

728
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,829
lch bin ein Chauffeur von Jo de Vries.

729
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,637
(Speak German)

730
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,873
(Lowing)

731
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,110
(Woman speaks German)

732
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,557
(Officer shouts in German)

733
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,035
Said tomorrow's dinner would be
held up if he didn't let us get through.

734
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,918
- Would that be Mrs de Vries?
- Suppose so.

735
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,509
(Woman and driver speak Dutch)

736
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,556
(Jo) Are you there?

737
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,473
- Englishmen, are you there?
- Yes, all six of us.

738
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,677
When the truck stops, the driver
will open up, get out at once.

739
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,596
(Lorry door closes)

740
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,276
- Which way?
- There.

741
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,396
(Speaks German)

742
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,197
(Speak German)

743
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,273
She's getting the Jerries
to unload the truck for her.

744
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,477
- She's a cool customer.
- These Dutch girls are wizard.

745
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,916
They are. Our girls would do just
the same if they had the chance.

746
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,150
(Men chat in German)

747
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,033
(Distant murmuring)

748
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,874
(Men sing in German)

749
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,197
(Singing ends,
men chat and laugh in German)

750
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,513
(Jo whispers) We're passing over
the quarters of 200 German soldiers.

751
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,996
(Singing resumes)

752
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,832
Louis?

753
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,830
(Chat quietly in Dutch)

754
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,992
(Dripping)

755
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,597
We're over my house.
lt's the German headquarters.

756
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,830
My rooms are at the end of the wing.

757
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,036
All of you, in the other room.

758
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,792
Take it easy.

759
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,277
You are safe here.
This place has good walls and floors.

760
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,239
You can talk as much as you want to
and you can take off those things.

761
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,878
There's a radio here.

762
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,356
lt's tuned in to the BBC.

763
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,676
Use it if you like.

764
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,797
Only don't start dancing.
Just below here is the officers' mess.

765
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,317
l must leave you now. Got to go back the
way we came and come in by the front door,

766
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,356
or they might start thinking.

767
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,238
Lock the door behind me
and only open it to this knock.

768
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,673
(Three knocks and rap)

769
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,274
- V.
- Yes, V.

770
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,750
Pity, isn't it?
l never felt more like dancing in my life.

771
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,277
Just imagine, officers' mess below,
Jerries all over the place and no dancing.

772
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,396
Such charming partners too.

773
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,436
- What time is it?
- 21 :56.

774
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,078
Pity. We've missed the news.

775
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,833
- What time did you you say it was?
- 21 :56.

776
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,672
- Hazel!
- Who?

777
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,149
(All) Hazel Mason,
home and forces programme.

778
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,038
Oh, your wife.
l thought l recognised the voice.

779
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,111
(Woman singing on radio)

780
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,832
Steady, steady.

781
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,791
Not so fast.

782
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,036
That's better.

783
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,111
She's good.

784
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,428
She's damned good.

785
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,910
l hope your wife won't object to us
undressing during her big scene.

786
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,356
- lf she knew where you were, she'd twitter.
- Shh.

787
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,589
(Singing ends)

788
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,274
- All over.
- How was she?

789
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,112
Not bad. Not at all bad.

790
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,192
Yes...very good.

791
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,717
l hadn't thought about it till now but we'll
have been posted missing this morning.

792
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,678
- l had thought of it.
- l don't think the others have.

793
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,478
All the better for them.

794
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,596
l suppose Hazel knows about Frank by now.

795
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,750
Bound to. They'd get her at the BBC.

796
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,239
She's on tonight.

797
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,072
Where do you expect her to be, off?

798
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,430
(Bugle plays)

799
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,670
(Rhythmic marching)

800
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,998
Good blackout they got here.

801
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,074
You know, that's funny,
them blacking out because of us.

802
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,514
- l suppose we do fly over here, eh, Frank?
- Katwijk? Yes, often.

803
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,873
lt feels like the end of a long term
with a cheap supporting cast.

804
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,077
No good looking in there
for small change, my boy.

805
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,310
You know, that's very significant.

806
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,994
Five of these woollens
are German to one British.

807
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,230
Might be something in that after the war.

808
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,437
Yorkshire woollens in Holland,
they might go for it in a big way.

809
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,112
Don't let anybody know l said so.

810
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,193
l don't promise. l never talk about anything
but woollens. Can't cure myself.

811
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,477
- What's funny about woollens?
- All right, don't get excited.

812
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,633
Which should the world know more about,
British actors or British cloth?

813
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,631
(Three knocks and a rap)

814
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,550
Now, let me see you all.

815
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,078
- Frau de Vries, may l introduce...
- No, you may not.

816
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,116
l shall forget your names anyway.

817
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,873
- Well, you don't mind us thanking you?
- No.

818
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,793
Why did you do that?

819
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,270
l don't know. l was thinking of my own wife.

820
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,556
- lt wasn't only you.
- l see.

821
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,394
- Were you a diplomat before the war?
- No, Johnny's the diplomat.

822
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,994
- l'm just an actor.
- Of course.

823
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,834
No Englishman would kiss a woman's hand,
except perhaps an actor.

824
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,434
- Snub or compliment?
- Compliment.

825
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,990
The way you handled those Germans
taught me something about acting.

826
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,629
lt isn't so difficult.
They're an unhappy people.

827
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,793
l would rather be a Dutchman
in Holland now than any German soldier.

828
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,634
They want to believe that somebody's
their friend and that's the trick.

829
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,676
A dangerous trick for a woman.

830
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,274
You don't seem to think much of women.

831
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,477
Besides l have Louis and Willem.
He was your driver.

832
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,677
They're the only servants left
but they won't leave me.

833
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,994
l was afraid when l first started,

834
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,197
just as a pilot is afraid
the first time he goes solo.

835
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:54,308
Then after a few minutes, when he finds
he's still alive, begins to like it.

836
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,954
- Will you do something for me?
- Yes, of course.

837
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,999
l want you to go and see my husband
when you get back to England.

838
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,389
- Your husband?
- l'm not mad.

839
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,630
He's in London. l'll give you his address.

840
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,110
- But we heard...
- l know. l spread that story myself.

841
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,192
Nobody knows the truth,
not even my friends.

842
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,236
But he's alive and in London.

843
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,912
Do you ever hear from him?

844
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,516
Five times a week. He's one of
the Dutch announcers of Radio Oranje.

845
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,750
- What...
- Radio Orange.

846
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,875
Oh.

847
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:30,397
So you see we're two, on both sides
of the channel. We're still fighting.

848
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,870
Well, leave it to us.
Can we get cracking tonight?

849
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,077
You may be here for days or hours.
lt depends on your air force.

850
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,709
- You can only get away in a raid.
- We want to get back, raid or no raid.

851
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,711
- Look here...
- Are you in command?

852
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,314
- No, he's a Yorkshireman.
- Are you in command?

853
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,837
- No. You are.
- We have to get you back to England.

854
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,469
You won't be the first or the last
to leave this house for England.

855
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,516
You'll reach the sea in a fishing boat

856
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,990
and the fishing boat by a row boat
from the cellar of this house

857
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,036
and to the cellar by a back staircase.

858
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,237
The corridor which passes
my door leads to that staircase.

859
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,598
The corridor has two features,
a sentry...and a glass roof.

860
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,830
- And so?
- lf you were his officer,

861
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,070
what orders would you give in an air raid?

862
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,550
Well, tell him not to stand about
under a glass roof, l suppose.

863
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,394
Exactly. During a raid,
the corridor is left unguarded.

864
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,232
Now, do you understand?

865
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,276
Exactly.

866
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,433
Everything is prepared.
There's nothing to do now but wait.

867
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,552
(Rain falling)

868
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,471
<i>Owing to bad weather conditions,</i>

869
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,677
<i>there were no operations over</i>
<i>enemy territory last night.</i>

870
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,512
You're telling me.

871
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,838
Mon herr.

872
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,512
Pardon, mon herr.

873
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,316
Our wine has been drunk by the Germans
but being a Dutch woman,

874
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,473
l think that Dutch water is a better drink
than French champagne.

875
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,029
l'm sorry l haven't been able to give you
the food l would have liked to

876
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,076
but we haven't very much left.

877
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,674
l mean, not very much left to eat.

878
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,069
But we've kept everything else.

879
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,674
We can think and hope...

880
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,432
and fight.

881
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,157
l give you a toast. Louis.

882
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,077
Our motto since the house of Orange
drove out the Spaniards 300 years ago.

883
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,476
''Je maintiendrai.''

884
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,914
lt's nice to be a woman again,
even for half an hour.

885
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,229
What do they reckon that motto
of yours means, then, ma'am?

886
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,278
''We can take it.''

887
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:20,077
Well, l never. 300 years ago. We don't
seem to have progressed much, do we?

888
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,278
George.

889
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,270
Come on, George.

890
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,669
l don't know why everybody's looking at me.

891
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,673
After all we have a diplomat
and an actor here.

892
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,676
l suppose it's my age.

893
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:53,908
Well, my dear young lady, we can't
offer you anything except our love...

894
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:00,273
our gratitude and our admiration for
a brave woman and a fearless country.

895
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,591
But we can promise you one thing...

896
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:11,508
a growing help, an attack,
which will sweep these Germans from...

897
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,556
(Distant hum of aeroplane engines)

898
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,311
(Air-raid sirens blare)

899
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,078
Air raid!

900
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,196
(Jo and Louis speak in Dutch)

901
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,398
Come here, all of you.

902
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,436
(Distant shouts in German)

903
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,276
You see? That's what you're doing for us.

904
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,429
Can you hear them running for shelter?

905
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,910
Can you understand what that means
to all the occupied countries,

906
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,673
to enslaved people
having it drummed into their ears

907
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,069
that the Germans are masters of the earth?

908
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:12,188
Seeing those masters running for shelter,
seeing them crouching under tables

909
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,636
and hearing that steady hum
night after night,

910
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,952
that noise which is oil
for the burning fire of our hearts.

911
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,634
(Distant booming and hum of aircraft)

912
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,596
(Distant booming continues)

913
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,795
(Door thumps)

914
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,836
(Men shout in German)

915
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,549
(Speaks German)

916
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,795
(Man replies)

917
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,836
(Whispers) Stop here.

918
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,669
(Men speak German)

919
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,158
(Whistles appreciatively)

920
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,276
(Men talk excitedly in German)

921
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,556
(Jo speaks German)

922
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,116
She's leading him up
the garden path beautifully.

923
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,749
(Men chat excitedly)

924
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:48,240
- They're expecting another chap, Fritz.
- A little reception committee for Fritzy.

925
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,074
He's gone to get a Korkenzieher.
l don't know what Korkenzieher means.

926
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,470
(Jo and soldiers flirt in German)

927
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,513
Oh!

928
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,794
(Whispers) She's dropped his torch
in the drink.

929
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,953
- Since when did you speak German?
- l can understand that much.

930
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,031
(Footsteps)

931
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,076
(Calls out happily in German)

932
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,672
Hello, Fritzy.

933
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,358
OK.

934
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,436
Now, what about this Korkenzieher?

935
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,630
- Of course.
- What is it?

936
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,199
Corkscrew.

937
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,032
Cut it out.

938
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,838
l'll be Fritz.

939
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,718
You others follow as soon as the fight starts.

940
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,869
(Men speak German with Jo)

941
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,630
(All shout)

942
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,472
(Gagging)

943
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,516
(Shouts in German)

944
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,190
- All right, Mrs de Vries? Tom?
- Yes.

945
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,554
- Kiboshed.
- Bob?

946
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,675
KO.

947
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,910
- Frank? Geoff?
- All correct, sir.

948
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,118
(Speaks Dutch)

949
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,592
Louis!

950
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,830
(Both speak Dutch)

951
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,398
You can't wait for the tide to turn or the
fishing boat. These three will be missed.

952
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,597
- We can't leave you in a spot like this.
- Don't worry about me.

953
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,194
And don't worry about these Germans.

954
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,398
We didn't invite them to our country but
we can take care of them once they're here.

955
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,198
(Speaks Dutch)

956
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,236
That tunnel leads to the river.

957
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,393
Watch out for a fishing boat coming
upstream with two white diamonds on it.

958
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,756
Try and contact the fishermen.
lf you can't, trust to luck.

959
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,913
The danger will be at the swing bridge
at the mouth of the river. lt's guarded.

960
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,117
You may be challenged.
You must use your own judgment.

961
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,599
Now, hurry.

962
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,274
- What about the course?
- Due west.

963
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,477
Steer by a light
you will pick up eight miles out.

964
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,757
lt's a German rescue buoy for their airmen
who hit the sea.

965
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,513
Keep well to the left of it
and watch out for E-boats.

966
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,318
- You have your compass?
- Yes.

967
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,073
Don't waste my corkscrew, bring a bottle.

968
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,516
Well, God bless you.

969
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,997
l suppose that's
the one advantage of being old.

970
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,559
(Distant hum of aircraft)

971
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,031
Good luck.

972
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,076
(Distant booming)

973
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,472
Stand by.

974
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,038
ln.

975
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,036
- Out!
- (Booming)

976
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,236
(Explosions)

977
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,273
Swing bridge ahead.

978
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,636
(Klaxon blasts)

979
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,196
(Mutters in German)

980
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,396
(Distant booming)

981
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,756
Here come the fishing boats.

982
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,836
(Happy chattering)

983
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,113
Two white diamonds.

984
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,273
Our buoy friends.

985
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,798
Our chance will be when
the bridge starts to close again.

986
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:01,839
Stand by to cast off.
When l give the word, roll.

987
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,672
Get set.

988
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,716
Cast off.

989
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,156
(Distant booming)

990
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,036
(Whistles romantic melody)

991
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,630
ln.

992
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,472
Out.

993
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,516
ln.

994
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,996
(Whistling continues)

995
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,072
Quicken up.

996
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,074
Out.

997
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,156
(Stops whistling)

998
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,196
(Resumes whistling)

999
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:10,513
(Stops whistling)

1000
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,999
Halt!

1001
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,996
Now, row!

1002
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,756
(Guard) Halt!

1003
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,552
- ln, out, in...
- (Gunshot)

1004
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,154
- Keep down.
- We're not going to be caught!

1005
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,958
- (Gunshot)
- ln, out...

1006
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,996
(Machine-gun fire)

1007
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,197
- ln, out...
- (Heavy machine-gun fire)

1008
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,799
- ln, out, in, out...
- (Machine-gun fire continues)

1009
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,836
(Distant hum of aircraft)

1010
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,832
Our luck.

1011
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:00,310
They don't dare use searchlights
cos of our chaps.

1012
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,430
Let's slow it down. l'm done.

1013
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,953
What's your course, George?
We're going a bit north.

1014
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,791
Do you want any help, sir?

1015
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,836
You all right, George?

1016
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,349
George?

1017
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,749
- He's hurt.
- Steer, somebody.

1018
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,953
- Are you hurt badly, George?
- The tiller...

1019
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,792
Oh, don't worry about that.

1020
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,791
Here. Geoff.

1021
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,396
(Mutters)

1022
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,436
Here, pass me that sack.

1023
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,192
Oh, Lord.

1024
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,552
You all right now, George?

1025
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,673
lf l can stick it till morning, l'll do all right.

1026
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,994
l suppose this is what they call choppy.

1027
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,957
lt's what l call nasty.

1028
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,791
Hey, here they come.

1029
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,549
- They've spotted us, sir.
- Blast.

1030
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,438
They'll be here in three minutes.

1031
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,115
- lf this comes off, we're going to be all right.
- Shut the hatch.

1032
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,156
(Clanking)

1033
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,676
- Are they still jabbering, sir?
- Yes.

1034
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,309
They're ordering these two thugs
to sit quiet till E-boats get here.

1035
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,073
(Speaks German)

1036
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,794
What are we going to do about
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?

1037
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,836
You two stay put, understand?

1038
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,229
(Speaks German)

1039
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,074
You're far too cocky.
You understand that all right.

1040
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,718
OK.

1041
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,874
No need to have an empty stomach anyway.

1042
01:33:58,360 --> 01:33:59,918
(Klaxon blares)

1043
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,069
(Klaxon stops)

1044
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,194
Try to pick up something from our side.

1045
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,236
(Approaching engine)

1046
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,558
(Shouting in German)

1047
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,432
Out!

1048
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,637
(Man) They don't seem
to understand my German, sir.

1049
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,676
He's one of us!

1050
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,478
All line up!

1051
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,869
Steady! Watch it!

1052
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,278
- Hello? Air Force?
- That's right, six of us.

1053
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,751
What are you birds doing here?

1054
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,631
- A wonder Jerry didn't pick you up.
- Matter of fact, we picked up two of them.

1055
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,473
Jerries? Are they your prisoners?

1056
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,074
We've been arguing
about that since we got here.

1057
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,230
They were here first and radioed for help.

1058
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,198
l see their point.
Technically you're their prisoners.

1059
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,350
(Geoff) What, six to two? l like that.

1060
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,192
Sir.

1061
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,590
Got a bit too cocky, so we took their guns.

1062
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,798
Legally that weakens your status but don't
mind me, l'm a barrister when l'm ashore.

1063
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:36,838
Then we loosened the cables
and hoped we'd drift.

1064
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,357
You drifted all right. Another hour with
this tide and you'd be in our own minefields.

1065
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,079
- How long have you been in the pot?
- Since four.

1066
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,391
We saw you coming, sir.
We thought you was Jerries, sir.

1067
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:51,553
Trouble with you fellows is you can't see
anything unless you're 10,000 feet up.

1068
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,437
We heard they were sending E-boats.

1069
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,431
- When did you hear?
- Ten minutes ago.

1070
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,114
Ten minutes? What are we waiting for?
Get aboard.

1071
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,395
One of us is wounded.

1072
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,597
We shan't be able to get him
across to your boat.

1073
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,079
Yes. l quite agree. He can't be moved.

1074
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,914
Bit old for a flyer, isn't he?
Well, how do you feel about it?

1075
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,594
He's our rear gunner.

1076
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,194
Yes...if it wasn't for those E-boats.

1077
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:26,353
Of course, you don't want to leave him.
lt would be the wisest thing to do.

1078
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,830
We can't do that.
We're all the one crew, you see?

1079
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,036
Yes, l quite agree.

1080
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,638
- Coxswain!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1081
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,314
- Take this lobster pot in tow!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1082
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,152
What about the E-boats?

1083
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,754
That to the E-boats. Next stop Dover.

1084
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,914
- That's all, Corbett.
- Thank you, sir.

1085
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,318
Well, George, this is the new kite.
How do you like it?

1086
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,356
Yes, that's more my size.

1087
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,358
Right. The target's Berlin.
