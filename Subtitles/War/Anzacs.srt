It's enough.

in running a cattle property, anyway?

can see the thing clearly

then surely you, as a scholar, can.

687
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,680
Martin said the idea was to attack
Germany through the back door.

688
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,480
They even gave us a new name
for the occasion - ANZAC.

689
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,640
Well, Pat says it sounds like
a South American Indian tribe,

690
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,240
but it stands for the Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps.

691
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,040
The mood was quiet.

692
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,520
The boys knew that all of Australia
would be watching us today.

693

in ages past

What are you
breaking up the crate for?

696
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,720
Firewood, Roly.
Haven't you ever been in the bush?

697
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,080
Course not. He was brought up
respectable, weren't you, Roly?

699
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,040
Now, remember, lads,
the biscuits and water you have

700
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,720
are to last for three days.

701
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,880
There's nothing else
at this spot in Gallipoli.

702
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,520
Right, skip.
Nothing but Turkish soldiers.

703
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
Stub out that cigarette.

704
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,040
Now, we turn left once ashore,
do the beach quickly.

705
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,520
No smoking.

706
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,000
Good luck to you, lads.
You too, skip.

707
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Good luck to you, sir.
Good luck, Roly.

708
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,280
Three days rations, boys -
the biscuits and the water.

709
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,794

it's a mistake.

00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,080
Of my three brigades, one has ceased
to exist as a fighting formation.

864
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,600
The other two
have suffered severe casualties.

865
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,600
Where are you getting
your information from?

866
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,760
From wounded
and men returning to the beach.

867
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,280
God, what have shocked men and
stragglers to say that is accurate?

868
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,240
It leads me to the conclusion
that our fighting spirit

869
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,440
that has held up so far will crack
under this impossible pressure.

870
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,280
I believe we should evacuate
before this happens.

871
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,160
An evacuation at night in contact with the
enemy - that's a recipe for a shambles.

872
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,520
I'd rather stay and die on the beach.

873
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,760
I visited a number of the forward
companies. They're holding well.

Up there, the thought of failure
hasn't even entered their heads.

875

I cannot take responsibility
for evacuation.

rusty if possible.

1038
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,193

1039
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,873

1040
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,200
Voila.
Bloody marvellous.

1041
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,000

and the best it can do is a bomb in a tin.

1042

1043

Yeah, course.
Stay where you are!

1044

Good to see you, Roly.
How's Kate?

1046
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,080
Good, mate.
How's your gut?

1047
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,960
Never mind.
What about the nurses, mate?

1048
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,120
Is this the way to Second Brigade HQ?

1049
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,040
Mr Murdoch.
Hello. You back already?

1050
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,840
Martin, isn't it?
That's right.

1051
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,440
Weren't you due for a convalescence?

1052
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, you know - someone's gotta
look after these blokes.

1053
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,960
Oh. See you around, no doubt.
Yeah. Straight down that way.

1054
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,393
Thank you.

1055
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,640
Who's he, mate?
Keith Murdoch.

1056
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,120
Oh, the reporter bloke.

1057
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,600
He's not your ordinary reporter,
I tell you. I met him on Lemnos.

1058
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,560
He's supposed to be looking into
postal arrangements for the troops.

1059
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,720
There's more to him than meets the eye.

1060
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,800
Yeah? Good or bad?

1061
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,280
He's on our side.

1062
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,480
You picked a good time to return.
The nobs are planning something.

1063
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,960
Well, I always was lucky.

1064
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Martin, I've written a poem.
Do you want to hear it?

1065
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,720
Yeah.
Oh, spare us, mate.

1066
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,000
Hang on. I think the kid's
got a bit of talent.

1067
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,760
Come on, Roly.
Go on, on the box.

1068

1081
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,360
Morning, Colonel White.
Morning, Murdoch.

1082
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,800
How are your, er,
inquiries coming along?

1083
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,279
They're progressing, thank you.

1084
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,560
We had a signal
from the Commander-in-Chief.

1085
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,400
He requests a departure date from you.

1086
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,880
Requests or orders?

1087
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,440
At that level it's the same thing.

1088
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,520
He is aware, I imagine,

1089
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,560
that I'm here at the behest
of the Australian Government.

1090
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,280
I'm afraid the British high command
is not much preoccupied

1091
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,520
with the wishes
of the Australian Government.

1092
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,875
But they are quite willing
to use our troops.

1093
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,793
I should like to stay.

1094
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,551
At least until after the big attack.

1095
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,000
It's not like you to be so quiet, Colonel.

1096
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,480
It's not part of my job
to supply information to civilians.

1097
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,200
No. But it is mine.

1098
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,633
And to governments.

1099
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,280
I think the Commander-in-Chief
is aware of that.

1100
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,113
Particularly your conversations
with the 'Times' correspondent.

1101
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,080
I see.

1102
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,000
The high command's intelligence
is good.

1103
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,992
I only hope their generalship
is up to the same standard.

1104
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,634
There is a rumour that General Walker
is strongly against the attack.

1105
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,320
He regards it
as an unnecessary sacrifice

1106
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,833
of Australians and New Zealanders.

1107
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,559
As a soldier,
you don't expect me to answer that.

1108
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,520
No.

1109
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,229
But as a civilian,
you don't expect me not to ask it.

1110
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,640
A date, Murdoch. They want a date.

1111
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,232
And they shall have one.

1112
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,593
Sooner or later.

1113
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,953

1116
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,040
Oh, keep away from me.

1117
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,600
Mrs Baker, I only want to have a word.

1118
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,560
You only come round when there's
something dead in the paddock.

1119
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,920
Mrs Baker, please.

1120
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,150
You've got an army telegram,
haven't you?

1121
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,440
No, I don't have any
telegrams with me today.

1122
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,000
But I do have some news
of your son, Dick.

1123
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,240
I thought you'd like to know.
I gather you haven't had a letter yet.

1124
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,720
Kate, she writes like clockwork,
but Dick's not one for pen and paper.

1125
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,840
Martin Barrington's letters
have been coming through

1126
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,720
and he writes so much about Dick.

1127
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Well, go on, then.
Oh, please, Reverend.

1128
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,280
For a start, it appears your son
is doing well in the army.

1129
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,838
They've already made him a corporal.

1130
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,840
Here, mate. You OK?

1131
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,480
Yeah, OK.

1132
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,960
What's it like?

1133
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,720
It's a hell of a fight, but the boys
are in the Turkish trenches.

1134
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,200
Yeah?

1135
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,795

tunnels and things all over the place.

1136
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:58,280
It's our luck to be a carrying party
while the others do the fighting.

1137
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,350
Well, it suits me just fine.

1138
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,320
(Sighs)
So you had a long talk to Kate, eh?

1139
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,039
Yeah, long enough.
You know, just what I told you.

1140
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,600
You'll do the right thing by her,
won't you?

1142

Well, you lot
generally get what you want.

All I was doing...
No, listen to me.

She's my sister and she's got a future.

1145
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,880
I don't want her headed
in the wrong direction.

1146
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,400
Yeah. And you mean my direction.
Depends on what you've got in mind.
