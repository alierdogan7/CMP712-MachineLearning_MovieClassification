1
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,521
Who the hell
is he trying to kid?

2
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,419
Hello? Hello, Abbeville?

3
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,762
What? But if you cannot
place them, advise Paris.

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,961
I'm at my winds end,
but carry on.

5
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,434
Reinforcements, sir?

6
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,673
Why don't you cut out
the clowning?

7
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,648
- Me, sir? What have I done?
- Don't ever let me see you...

8
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,208
doing a victory roll
over my airfield again.

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,186
I thought it would buck up
the civilians.

10
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,089
For God's sake, Jamie,
give your brain a chance.

11
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,066
Corporal,
refuel them immediately!

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,442
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,876
So anyway, he hit me
and made me nose bleed...

14
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,975
Corporal, I don't mean
with your blood.

15
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,610
I gave him a couple of socks...

16
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,587
And re-arm them.

17
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,180
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,162
Hello, Harvey. Where's Jumbo?

19
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,164
Posted missing last night.

20
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,825
You acting C.O.?

21
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,097
Oh, yeah. Of what?

22
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,503
Five serviceable aircraft.
No spares. No contact.

23
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,973
First we knew the bastards
would overrun us...

24
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,703
was when we tried to land.

25
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,711
But yes, I hear you very well.

26
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,679
Eh? What?

27
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,375
Are you sure?

28
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,643
They are at Sedan?

29
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,117
For the benefit
of the uneducated among us...

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,552
I shall translate.

31
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,613
Archam can't believe
that Sedan's fallen. I can.

32
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,689
It's no use. They'll be here
in half an hour.

33
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,164
We must leave immediately.

34
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,826
Yes, let's get
the hell out of it.

35
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,232
Where to, sir?

36
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,794
Why don't you follow me
and find out? Come on, idiots.

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,998
After you.

38
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,836
Unless they've got there
before us.

39
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,037
Get that buzzard out of here!
We'll go with what we've got!

40
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,673
All right.
Forget your kit. Let's move.

41
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,249
Get all the transport you can
and get the men out of here.

42
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,852
All N.C.O. S report to me
immediately!

43
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,212
You know what to do
with the lame ducks?

44
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,112
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,919
Bombs away.

46
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,893
All the yanks, over here!

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,719
Load 'em up!

48
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,839
Over the wing.

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,007
Flood the cowling.

50
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,539
Plenty of it.

51
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,226
Right! Stand clear!
Into the trucks!

52
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,427
Come on!
We haven't got all day!

53
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,122
"To the permanent
Secretary of State for air...

54
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:06,723
"Sir, I have the honor to refer
to the very serious calls...

55
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,599
"which have recently been
made upon fighter command...

56
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,796
"in an attempt to stem
the German invasion...

57
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,465
"of the continent.

58
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,670
"I hope and believe that our
armies may yet be victorious...

59
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,575
"in France and Belgium...

60
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,512
"but we have to face
the possibility...

61
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,176
"that they may be defeated.
In this case...

62
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,016
I presume that there is no one
who would deny...

63
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,488
"that England
should fight on...

64
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,185
"even though the remainder
of the continent of Europe...

65
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,161
"is dominated by the Germans.

66
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,856
"I must therefore request...

67
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:43,836
"That not one more fighter
be sent across the channel.

68
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,498
"If the home defense

69
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,997
"in desperate attempts to remedy
the situation in France...

00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:54,172
"defeat in France will involve

71
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,148
"and irremediable defeat

00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,845
"I have the honor to be, sir...

73
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:04,949
"your obedient servant,
H.C.T. Dowding."

74
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,493
Air Chief Marshal Dowding, sir.

75
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,971
You do realize, Dowding,
the position this puts us in?

76
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:29,141
I realize that the French have
been promised this squadron.

77
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,844
By Churchill personally.

78
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,579
He's given the French
prime minister his word.

79
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,451
You do appreciate, Dowding...

80
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,517
that Churchill
will have to see this?

81
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,797
That's why I wrote it.

82
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,240
This is the BBC home service.

83
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,768
Here is the news.

84
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,974
In the House of Commons
this afternoon...

85
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,108
the prime minister,
Mr. Churchill, said...

86
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,143
"What General de Gaulle called
the Battle of France is over.

87
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,090
The battle of Britain
is about to begin."

88
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,121
Eyes right!

89
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,203
I welcome you in the name of
the Second Luftwaffe, General.

90
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,675
Thank you, thank you,
Kesselring.

91
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,200
- My dear Fink.
- General.

92
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,212
Everything all right?

93
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,770
We are ready, General.
We can start.

94
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,714
Very well, gentlemen,
then forward.

95
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,704
Attention!

96
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,775
Eyes right!

97
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,963
Call out the guard!

98
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,363
Call out the guard!

99
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,841
Attention!

100
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,350
If I have to inspect
one more bomber...

101
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,851
I won't recommend you for
a Field Marshal, Kesselring.

102
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,694
Please, may I finish
the inspection?

103
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,994
Certainly.

104
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,398
Sir.

105
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,406
Pleasant return journey.

106
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,421
The English are not ordained
by fate to be our enemies.

107
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,252
You heard it yourself,
Jeschonnek.

108
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,621
This time he's wrong.

109
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,956
They are completely
finished... done for.

110
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,452
We'll never have a chance
like this again.

111
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,623
Absolute nonsense!

112
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,327
Nonsense, do you call it?
It's a pure catastrophe.

113
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,261
Herr Baron von Richter.

114
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,636
The Fuehrer
will speak to you now.

115
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,623
My dear Max!

116
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:52,289
How lovely to see you
back in Switzerland so soon.

117
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,300
I came straight from Berlin
an hour ago.

118
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,802
The ambassador
will see you now, sir.

119
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,135
Thank you. Excuse me, please.

120
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,178
Sir David,
I'm again instructed...

121
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,081
to emphasize that
the Fuehrer wishes...

122
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,812
to avoid further bloodshed.

123
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,151
England is not
our natural enemy...

124
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,316
and he offers guarantees
for the British empire...

125
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,054
if you give Germany
a free hand in Europe.

126
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,461
Goering and his Luftwaffe
would like to flatten London...

127
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,829
as a prelude to invasion.

128
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,665
It's two lumps you take,
isn't it?

129
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,603
What's left of your army...

130
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,765
abandoned its weapons
at Dunkirk.

131
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,674
You're defenseless
and just playing for time.

132
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,077
We know of the moves
you're making in Washington.

133
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,411
We know the Americans
won't be drawn in.

134
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,385
Their embassy in London
gives you two weeks.

135
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,982
So what's stopping you?

136
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,958
Look, David. The Fuehrer
is being very reasonable.

137
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,089
He offers guarantees.

138
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:03,625
Experience shows the Fuehrer's
guarantees guarantee nothing.

139
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,933
What about Churchill?

140
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,838
After our last appeal,
what do we hear?

141
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,741
"We will fight them
on the beaches."

142
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,267
With what?

143
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,746
Winston gets
carried away sometimes.

144
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,113
With liquid courage.

145
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,015
That's what they tell me.

146
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,077
Clearly, you don't know him.

147
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,917
David, we are not
asking for anything.

148
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,482
Europe is ours.

149
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,462
We can walk into Britain
whenever we like.

150
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,761
If you think
we're going to gamble...

151
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,826
on Herr Hitler's guarantees,
you're making a grave mistake.

152
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,897
All those years in England seem
to have left you none the wiser.

153
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,774
We're not easily frightened.

154
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,838
Also, we know how hard it is for
an army to cross the channel.

155
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,613
The last little corporal
to try it came a cropper.

156
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,052
So don't threaten
or dictate to us...

157
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,455
until you're
marching up Whitehall!

158
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,016
And even then we won't listen.

159
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,766
Heil Hitler.

160
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,577
It's unforgivable.

161
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,589
I lost my temper.

162
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,753
The maddening thing
is that he's right.

163
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,921
We're not ready.

164
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,931
We're on our own.

165
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,924
We've been playing for time.

166
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,802
And it's running out.

167
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,047
Silly bitch!

168
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,647
He's calling you
names again, Harold.

169
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,551
I spent half a week settling her
and the kids in the country...

170
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,994
and now,
"I'm bored," she says!

171
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,112
One of your elite
trying to land without wheels.

172
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,823
Boomps-a-daisy.

173
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,199
It's enough to make you weep.

174
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,390
And welcome home, sir.

175
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,555
Undercarriage lever
a bit sticky, was it, sir?

176
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,588
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it was.

177
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,159
Well, I wouldn't tell the C.O.
That, sir, not if I were you.

178
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,020
You can teach...

179
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,860
monkeys to fly
better than that!

180
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,865
I'm terribly sorry
about that, sir.

181
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:02,237
- It won't happen again.
- Keep your jacket on, boy.

182
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,469
How many hours have you done
in spits, Simon?

183
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,035
On spits, sir? 10 1/2.

184
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,914
We'll make it eleven before
Jerry has you for breakfast.

185
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,849
Spring chicken to shite hawk
in one easy lesson.

186
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,829
Attack, attack, attack...

187
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,391
This is Rabbit Leader.
Are you receiving me?

188
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,926
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3.

189
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,939
Receiving you loud and clear.

190
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,271
Right. I'll try
and get on your tail...

191
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,904
and I want you to take
evasive action. Understood?

192
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,379
Hello, Rabbit Leader.

193
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,008
Red-3 on 3. Understood.

194
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,673
Attack, attack, attack,
attack, attack, attack...

195
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,542
Hello, Rabbit Leader.

196
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,779
I thought you might
come in from the sun.

197
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,787
Don't think. Don't just glance.

198
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,721
Look! Search for the bastards!

199
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,623
And never fly in a straight
line, or you're a dead duck.

200
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,528
- Sir.
- Now, let's try it again.

201
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,864
Or, in other words,
beware of the Hun in the sun...

202
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,704
who, for reasons best
known to himself...

203
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,711
has confined his recent attacks
to our channel convoys.

204
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,940
However,
this won't last forever.

205
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,007
But it has given us a chance
to pull ourselves together...

206
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,540
and to train people like you.

207
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,418
As fighter controllers, you'll
be joining an organization...

208
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,615
which, thank the good Lord...

209
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,453
was not rushed up
hastily yesterday.

210
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,255
It'll be a pain in the neck
to the enemy when he comes.

211
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,228
It's the joker up our sleeves.

212
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,527
Now, the R.A.F. Chain
shows us where they are.

213
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,123
The information
is passed to group...

214
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,758
group scrambles
the necessary squadrons...

215
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,826
and you, at sector level...

216
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,738
guide our chaps
to the interception.

217
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,005
It's been tried and tested.
It works.

218
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,105
So don't blame the system
if you're no good.

219
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,912
Now, clearly, 11 Group here...

220
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,919
will bear the brunt
of the battle...

221
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,921
as those of you
who are posted there...

222
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,980
will find out
to your discomfort.

223
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,787
12 Group is our second line
of defense...

224
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,452
and covers the industrial
midlands and the north.

225
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,758
13 Group, Scotland
and the northeast...

226
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,390
and 10 Group,
the west of England.

227
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,423
More than half
the fighter-command squadrons...

228
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,435
are stationed here
at 11 Group...

229
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,267
near the coast where we
expect the invasion...

230
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,773
and also able
to protect London...

231
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,709
which is as far as the bombers
can get with fighter escort.

232
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,769
But I think
we can leave strategy...

233
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,542
to those with egg
on their hats.

234
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,106
Attention!

235
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,957
Please, gentlemen, the Inspector
General has just arrived.

236
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,733
Here.

237
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,366
Thank you, Captain.

238
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,345
Ah, my dear Foehn.
You are well?

239
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,679
- Yes, thank you, General.
- And Falke?

240
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,309
Yes, thank you, General.

241
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,786
May I introduce
my brother Hans, sir?

242
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,186
Another fighter ace perhaps?

243
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,918
When I get the chance
to fight, General.

244
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,619
General.

245
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,527
We have borrowed this.

246
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,561
- Dover?
- Dover.

247
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,500
Those masts are their
radio direction finders?

248
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,940
Yes. Their secret weapon.

249
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,739
Which we captured at Dunkirk.

250
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,181
Our Stukas can deal with them.

251
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,549
Excuse me, General, but why?

252
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,282
If they know we're coming,
so much the better.

253
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,187
We don't have to look for them.

254
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,558
The pilots are in excellent
spirits, General.

255
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,324
I have eyes in my head,
Osterkamp.

256
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,331
I merely wanted to say,
General...

257
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,855
we shouldn't wait too long.

258
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,891
It may happen sooner
than you think.

259
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,596
Please, gentlemen.

260
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,166
Come, Falke.

261
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,537
Thank you, General.

262
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,740
This delay is an incredible
piece of luck.

263
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:44,154
I mean, they roll up France
and then stop.

264
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,384
They could've come right on.

265
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,588
You know,
our latest intelligence...

266
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:54,429
is that Herr Hitler
is sightseeing in France.

267
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,593
'Tis rather pleasant weather.

268
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,160
Oh, no, I mean it.
He's on holiday.

269
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,035
I'm not complaining, Minister.

270
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,869
No, no, no,
seriously, Dowding...

271
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,433
the morale factor is vital.

272
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,445
I saw Beaverbrook on Monday.

273
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,811
Now, he's going
to be able to deliver...

274
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,976
as many as
a hundred fighters a week.

275
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:16,112
Well, after seeing you...

276
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,213
I want to be able to go
back to the cabinet...

277
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:22,215
and tell them you're
as confident as I am.

278
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,458
Damn it, man,
we've got 650 planes.

279
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:31,162
And they have 2,500 aircraft,
haven't they?

280
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,333
They won't all come over
at once, and we have radar.

281
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,637
Churchill puts great faith
in radar.

282
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,772
It's vital, but it won't
shoot down aircraft.

283
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,773
I must say, you don't exactly
exude a spirit of optimism.

284
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,015
God willing,
we will hold out, Minister.

285
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,456
I see. So I tell
the cabinet...

286
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,121
that you're trusting in radar
and praying to God... right?

287
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,687
More accurate
the other way around.

288
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,495
I'm trusting in God
and praying for radar.

289
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,662
But the essential arithmetic
is that our young men...

290
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,104
will have to shoot down
their young men...

291
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:13,042
at the rate of four to one
if we're to keep pace at all.

292
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,614
It's the oil pressure, sir,
but the gauge is being checked.

293
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,278
- All right, Charlie. Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

294
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,946
Never give up,
do you, Charlie?

295
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,285
Instrument check, sir.

296
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,291
I hope your new C.O.
Believes you.

297
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,293
He's going to be
one of your headaches now.

298
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,955
They know the orders...
don't tangle unnecessarily.

299
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,465
So it's "May I do
an engine check, sir?

300
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,296
"Or an undercarriage
check or a radio?"

301
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,961
Any excuse
to get at the Jerries.

302
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,971
At least it shows they're keen.

303
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,973
Yeah, they're a good bunch.

304
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,975
God knows what I'll find
in Scotland.

305
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,637
A lot of kids with down
on their cheeks.

306
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,145
Yeah, training them
to be fighter pilots...

307
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,238
is a damn sight more dodgy
than fighting Germans.

308
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,273
Well, you've got to earn
that new stripe somehow.

309
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,785
At least I got
three days in town.

310
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,684
Give my regards to your wife.

311
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,915
Thanks.

312
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,418
May I have a word, sir?

313
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,126
Send us back a haggis.

314
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,739
If you want permission
for a test flight...

315
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,799
the answer is no.

316
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,593
Large scotch, please.

317
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,968
You with that lot
down the road, sir?

318
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,336
No.

319
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,341
One and six, please.

320
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,808
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

321
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,416
Have you applied
for that post in Scotland?

322
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,887
- Darling, I can't.
- You can't.

323
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,150
You know I can't.

324
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,159
- You mean you don't want to.
- Can't. I've got a job.

325
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,821
What have we got?
What the hell is this?

326
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,262
Is it a marriage or a flaming
air force committee?

327
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,257
For God's sake, Colin,
don't start that all over again.

328
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,929
I knew this would happen.

329
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,597
I never wanted you
to join up... never.

330
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,700
Colin, please, try to behave
as if I were a human being.

331
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,440
You look more like a
parade-ground suffragette to me.

332
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,881
I'm just not cut out to wave
a wet hankie on sooty stations.

333
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,113
For God's sake,
who's asking you to?

334
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,781
We'll be
in Scotland together.

335
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,791
I never could stand
marching women.

336
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,492
You couldn't care less,
could you?

337
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,225
I cared enough
to come here fifty miles.

338
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,529
I didn't measure it.

339
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,829
I did.

340
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,496
I even booked a room.

341
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,038
Three days.

342
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,041
It would be marvelous.

343
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,587
Are you going to apply
for that posting or not?

344
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,422
Left, right, left.

345
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,429
Right, left, right, left, right.

346
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,261
Squad, halt!

347
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,790
Right turn!

348
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,636
Order arms!

349
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,101
Now, wait for it.

350
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,609
Squad...

351
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,805
dismissed!

352
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,778
Come on, Albert,
you're not dead yet.

353
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,288
- It's his turn.
- You'll be lucky.

354
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,052
Twelve pints, please, Fred.

355
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,616
One for the sarge.

356
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,321
Let him get his own.

357
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,861
No, sir, it's not Charlie.

358
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,567
It's some Hurricane
out of juice very likely.

359
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:07,874
Right. Call me directly
you hear anything.

360
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,593
Well, somebody
must have spotted him.

361
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,255
He can't just disappear.

362
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,491
All right, I'll hang on.

363
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,592
Sir, it's
Air Vice Marshal Park.

364
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,432
That's all we need now.

365
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,734
Jamie, hang onto this.

366
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,275
Good afternoon, sir.

367
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,300
Tell your men to relax.

368
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,606
How are they making out,
Canfield?

369
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,775
Half the squadron
are new pilots, sir.

370
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,877
That's why you were sent here,
to lick them into shape.

371
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,945
They get less warning here
than any other station...

372
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,014
so they must learn
to get up from standby...

373
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,083
in two minutes flat if they're
to intercept the enemy.

374
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,160
Hello. Dispersal.

375
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,164
Right.

376
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,330
Stand down, "A" flight.

377
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,681
Yours?

378
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,988
Yes, sir.

379
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,717
The chaps spoil her.

380
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,516
All right, Canfield, what's up?

381
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,995
You have a pilot missing.

382
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,497
Yes, sir.

383
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,362
Over the channel.

384
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,996
Is he much overdue?

385
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,505
Over two hours, sir.

386
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,201
I thought I'd made it clear
we're too near the enemy...

387
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,369
for pilots to go
swanning around on their own.

388
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,006
We can't afford
to lose them this way.

389
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,007
What's the excuse this time,
undercarriage check?

390
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,349
Instruments, sir.

391
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,355
We've all done it,
but that's no excuse.

392
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,516
What's his name?

393
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,583
Pilot officer Lambert, sir.

394
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,104
Gerhardt, my bath!

395
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,136
Yes, certainly, Major.

396
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,215
Do me a favor. Not now, Papa.

397
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,385
These are the day's instructions
for the Luftwaffe...

398
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,418
- and they must go off today.
- All right, if I must.

399
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,099
I know, you have just found it.

400
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,907
That doesn't concern you.
Hurry up, old man...

401
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,971
because my evening meal
will not wait for you.

402
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,576
In exactly five minutes,
we drive to Boulogne, OK?

403
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,053
Hans, look after Major Foehn.

404
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,663
Good evening, sir.
May I lead the way?

405
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,756
Certainly, my boy. Lead on.

406
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,666
Don't let him
near the wine cellar!

407
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,839
What's the best way to evade
a Spitfire, Major, shallow dive?

408
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,639
And curving in
at the same time.

409
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,646
But excuse me, Major,
my brother says...

410
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,046
a Spitfire
can outmaneuver a 109.

411
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,346
When we are in England,
let him take up a Spitfire...

412
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,409
and prove it to me in my 109.

413
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,320
Done! But don't forget
your life jacket!

414
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:43,794
I said look after our guest,
Hans, not drown him.

415
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,998
Major Foehn doesn't think much
of the shot-method.

416
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,229
If you would teach your boys
to shoot a little sharper...

417
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,703
the problem wouldn't arise.

418
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,673
Excuse me, Jafu II.
You are to report to Wissant.

419
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,608
- What, now, Papa?
- Immediately.

420
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,907
And Major Foehn also.

421
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:25,065
I think I know why we've been
asked to go to Wissant.

422
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,179
This is it.

423
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:05,939
Gentlemen... Eagle Day!

424
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,640
The destruction of the Royal
Air Force on the ground.

425
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,046
Zero hour for takeoff 7:15 A.M.

426
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,415
Our targets today
in southern England...

427
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,683
are the following airfields.

428
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,885
Manston, Biggin, Kenley...

429
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,053
Dover, Hawkinge.

430
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:28,964
It is our task to destroy
the R.A.F. On the ground.

431
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,434
There'll be nothing left for us.

432
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,869
Don't worry, gentlemen...

433
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,271
our omnibus drivers won't
be able to destroy everything.

434
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,435
Some Spitfires
will remain, anyway.

435
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,468
Even for you, Bruno.

436
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,149
Therefore, gentlemen...

437
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,651
fly in at maximum height
and make good use of it.

438
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,381
And try not to land
in the Channel.

439
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,322
Especially use your eyes
and watch your petrol gauges.

440
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,882
Remember, you've only got
thirty minutes over there.

441
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,918
Come on, chaps.

442
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,814
Away, I'm here.

443
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,647
Hostile 2-3.

444
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:58,842
Morning, all.

445
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,752
Bearing 1-8-6,
range thirty miles.

446
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,278
Twenty plus.

447
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,985
Height, six thousand.

448
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,925
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.

449
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,428
No I.F.F.

450
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,938
Hostile 2-9, now thirty plus.

451
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,100
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.

452
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,974
Recheck I.F.F., please,
Bentmarle.

453
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,714
Sorry to call you in, sir,
but something's building.

454
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,118
2-8 now forty plus.

455
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:39,384
Convoys?

456
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,914
None due through
until tonight, sir.

457
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,491
Hostile 3-1 forty plus, 1-6.

458
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,227
Better bring
more squadrons to standby.

459
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,429
Right, sir. Get me Beacon Hill.

460
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,234
Reconfirm Hostile 2-3.

461
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,242
Hostile 2-3, 1-8-0.

462
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,608
Getting interference
again, sir.

463
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,514
Not now, corporal, not now.

464
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,846
That's better.

465
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,442
Five miles.

466
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,980
I'm afraid the raid is entering
my ground range, Danmoor.

467
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,101
Stukas.

468
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,682
Get them up.

469
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,208
43 Squadron,
intercept Hostile 2-1.

470
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,879
That was Danmoor, sir.

471
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,185
Ventnar radar out of action.

472
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,517
Who's covering Dover?

473
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,723
54 Squadron, sir.

474
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,097
6th Squadron's airborne, sir.

475
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,009
Too slow. Some of them
took six and seven minutes.

476
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,740
They'll have to do it in two.

477
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,915
Tallyho, Velvet Leader!

478
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,552
Down there on the left.

479
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,222
Stukas!

480
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,390
Roger. Here we go.

481
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,093
Attacking now.

482
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:15,844
Yellow section, keep your eyes
peeled for the escort.

483
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,421
Spitfire!

484
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,043
Easier to hit than a barn door.

485
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,346
It's like shooting rats
in a barrel.

486
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,681
You'll be in a barrel...

487
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,846
if you don't watch out
for the fighters.

488
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,187
What's the matter?
Can you hear me?

489
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,984
Ventnar, and now Dover's
out of action.

490
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,584
- Our plots are drying up.
- Then we're blind.

491
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,187
So now we've only got
the observer corps.

492
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,129
This is only the beginning.

493
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,564
They won't stop now.

494
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,518
Heinkels.

495
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,797
Make it a hundred plus.

496
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,362
Hello? Hello?
Heinkels, hundred plus.

497
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,041
Yes, Center. Still going north.

498
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,444
Height?

499
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,107
Twelve thousand.

500
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,919
Dispersal.

501
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,921
2 Section, scramble!

502
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,617
Look alive!

503
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,449
Engine trouble!

504
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,615
Lookout.

505
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,146
Right.

506
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:18,420
Muck and filth everywhere,
Mr. Warrick. It's like a pigsty!

507
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,480
The cooks don't come on
till 6:00.

508
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,493
Well, you've got some
defaulters. Put them onto it.

509
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,257
Come on you lots, move!

510
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,992
You'd be there fast enough
if it was real!

511
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,557
At the double!

512
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,271
Oh, my God.

513
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,079
Section Officer Harvey!

514
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,308
Sir.

515
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,981
I've noticed
that some of your girls...

516
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,253
are now using the men's trenches
during air raid practice.

517
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,624
- It's got to stop.
- Sir.

518
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,630
And another thing...
gas mask cases...

519
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,565
they're for gas masks.
They're not handbags.

520
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,966
I do realize, of course,
that female requirements...

521
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,800
differ somewhat from the male.

522
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,204
Nevertheless,
that's no excuse to...

523
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,209
God's teeth!

524
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,609
Take cover!

525
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,591
Bastards.

526
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,508
At least we know
what Jerry's going for.

527
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,642
All our airfields,
unfortunately.

528
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,626
It's a squadron scramble, sir.

529
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,962
Don't be wet.
Get me the duty controller.

530
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,492
We've only just come down.
We're still refueling.

531
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,535
Don't just stand there!
Get one up!

532
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,705
Corporal Johnson!

533
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,943
Engine blocks away!

534
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,017
Rest of you men,
in the trenches!

535
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,915
Talk about a hairy takeoff.

536
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,719
- I saw Jimmy buy it.
- Did Archie get off?

537
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,125
Oh, I'm with you old boy,
but I've left my stomach behind.

538
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,220
Ah, shut up, will you!

539
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,357
Rabbit Leader
to Cowslip Control.

540
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,027
Do you read me? Over.

541
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,874
For Christ's sake, Cowslip,
wake up, will you?

542
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,899
Rabbit Squadron airborne.

543
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,444
Close up, Red-2!

544
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,809
Stick to me like glue, Simon.

545
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,290
Rabbit Leader, sorry about that.
This is Cowslip.

546
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,657
About time, too.
Where'd they go?

547
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,790
Bandits now twenty miles
east of you heading southeast.

548
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:32,097
Sector 1-2-0
and make Angels 2-0.

549
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,830
We'll go, Cowslip.

550
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,067
Rabbit's turning port... now.

551
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,444
Come in, Red-2.
Where the hell are you?

552
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,448
Where the hell are you, Simon?

553
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,895
You, lads, pull
yourselves together!

554
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,060
Get moving!
Get another shovel!

555
00:50:47,743 --> 00:50:49,836
Bates, pull yourself together.

556
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:53,404
Stay with them, Seymour.

557
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,750
It's all right. I'll see to it.

558
00:50:58,788 --> 00:51:00,915
How about two hands
over here, Officer?

559
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,220
Run the hoses out over here!

560
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:40,952
Put that cigarette out!

561
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:44,125
The mains have gone!
Can't you smell gas?

562
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:54,599
Don't you yell at me,
Mr. Warrick!

563
00:51:57,947 --> 00:51:59,539
Here, you men!

564
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:03,018
Don't stand there looking
at it, you idle shover!

565
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:10,686
You! Get me some stretchers
and the orderly.

566
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,626
- Ma'am.
- Fast!

567
00:52:16,832 --> 00:52:18,800
You can stand some of the girls
down now, Corporal.

568
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,461
Jones, Whitman,
clear up that mess.

569
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,061
Then you can take five minutes.

570
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:23,537
43, stand down.

571
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:25,335
1-1-1 released.

572
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:27,433
5-0-1 are down at Tangbear.

573
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:29,171
They couldn't get in
at Big Wing.

574
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:30,803
Few more days like this...

575
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:32,575
and we won't be able
to get them down anywhere.

576
00:52:32,615 --> 00:52:34,446
I suppose we could always
pull them all back...

577
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,849
north of the Thames,
out of range.

578
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:40,049
That is precisely what
they want us to do.

579
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:02,903
This is the BBC home service.

580
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:05,345
Here is the 9:00 news.

581
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,349
Large formations
of enemy aircraft...

582
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:10,352
today attacked targets
in southern England...

583
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:14,220
but the enemy's aerial armada
came in for heavy punishment.

584
00:53:14,256 --> 00:53:16,850
Over forty-seven German planes
were destroyed...

585
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:19,759
with a loss of only fifteen
of our own aircraft.

586
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:21,854
Six of these pilots were saved.

587
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:25,264
Several R.A.F. Aerodromes
were also attacked...

588
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:27,861
and some casualties
were sustained...

589
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:29,871
but they were light.

590
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:40,112
Colonel.

591
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:43,512
Good. Very good.

592
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,579
The weather is constant.

593
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:48,647
We have a stabilized
high pressure zone...

594
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:50,124
and we'll make use of it.

595
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,127
The proof, gentlemen.
We are destroying...

596
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:54,254
as many planes on the ground
as in the air.

597
00:53:54,296 --> 00:53:56,628
Thank you, Schmidt.
On the desk, please.

598
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,025
Reichsmarschall Goering
will certainly be interested...

599
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:01,900
in my report.

600
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:05,839
To date, almost 300 planes
have been destroyed.

601
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:14,139
Almost half the entire British
fighter force, gentlemen.

602
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:19,279
The Colonel can report
what he pleases.

603
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:20,652
The fact remains...

604
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:22,816
that our bombers continue
to be intercepted.

605
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:25,418
Because the English are now
bringing in their reserves.

606
00:54:25,461 --> 00:54:29,693
As from tomorrow, we'll increase
our attacks on these airfields.

607
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:35,671
And five Luftwaffes will attack
the north and north-east.

608
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:39,640
But that is outside the range
of our fighters, Colonel.

609
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:42,838
Also outside the range
of the English fighters.

610
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:46,939
Not even a Spitfire can be
in the north and the south...

611
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:48,279
at the same time.

612
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:10,163
How far are we from the coast?

613
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:18,205
Everybody, Action Stations.

614
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:24,752
Tomato Heinz to all.
Tomato Heinz to all.

615
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:27,654
Another ten minutes to target.

616
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,056
All ready at Fighter Stations.

617
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:33,493
Another ten minutes
to target. End.

618
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:41,400
Look! Spitfire!

619
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:53,080
Help yourself, everybody.
There's no fighter escort.

620
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,145
There! Right behind us!

621
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,467
Soapbox Leader, break it off.

622
00:58:29,502 --> 00:58:30,969
Home and tea.

623
00:58:31,003 --> 00:58:33,665
For once you deserve it.
Well done, everybody.
