It was during the civil war, so there was
no training, no physicals... nothing.

I was already leading a unit...

00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,821
All right, look at me.

Sir.

686
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,897
Sorry about the truck, sir.

687
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:23,198

Yes, sir.

You good?
Yeah.

691
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,000

A couple of hours.

692
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:59,935

693
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,706

Okay, we lost one of our boys.

698

for the record...

699
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:50,353
we can positively I.D. the individuals
on the ground as our own.

700
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:53,957
But, sir, I think it's clear...
Since we cannot make a positive ID...

701
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,026
this remains an official
search-and-rescue operation...

702
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:59,128

keep our bird on scene.

to be our boys...

704

823
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,193

to secure the area...

01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:31,800
That was her one mistake.
Think about it.

838

<i>So she's got a perfect record...</i>

841
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,745
because all she has to do is point
to Tonga's training camp...

842
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:44,813
and scream "Al-Qaeda"
and we just vaporize it.

843
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:47,983
Yep. And physical
confirmation is needed now.

844

And she gets caught somehow...

01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,788

846
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,356
the one person that can ID her.

847
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:58,561
(CHUCKLES) He was about to
tell us exactly who she was.

848
01:09:58,562 --> 01:09:59,695
So she offs him.

849
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,699
And we buy it.
Why wouldn't we?
I'm sure he did torture her.

850
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,968
Then she tells us
about the yellowcake...

851
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:08,404
convinces us to walk her
through the gauntlet...

852
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:11,339
so she doesn't miss her sale.

Half a klick away.

01:31:56,545 --> 01:31:59,013
I want you two to take
some "R" and "R," gentlemen.

1029
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:02,282
And I want you to make it count.

01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:06,753
Thanks, Chief.
Chief.

Where should we go?

1032
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:19,066
Jay, shift your weight.
Shut up, old man.

1033
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:23,137
This ain't "E" and "E,"
it's "R" and "R" for me.

1034
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:25,105
You know...

1035
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:29,109
I haven't thanked you yet.
For what?

1036
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,847
Your excellent work
in picking a vacation spot.

1037
01:32:32,848 --> 01:32:36,883
Come on, man. You know I was
born to roll like this.

1038
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:40,320
Yes, I do.
