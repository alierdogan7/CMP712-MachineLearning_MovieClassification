<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Last night I dreamed a deadly dream.</i>

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,835
<i>Beyond the Isle of Skye...</i>

3
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:39,606
<i>I saw a dead man win a fight...</i>

4
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,599
<i>and I think that man was I.</i>

5
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,336
<i>[Winston Churchill]</i>
<i>This we may say</i>—

6
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,338
<i>the sun of victory...</i>

7
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,331
<i>has begun to touch</i>
<i>our soldiers'helmets.</i>

8
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,502
<i>I have this day received</i>
<i>the following communication...</i>

9
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,616
<i>from General Alexander:</i>

10
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,619
<i>"Sir, the orders you gave me...</i>

11
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,755
<i>"on August 15, 1942...</i>

12
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,158
<i>"have been fulfilled.</i>

13
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,260

18
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,567
<i>Well, obviously we shall now</i>
<i>have to think of something else.</i>

19
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,348

20
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,018

21
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,321
<i>what that something else will be.</i>

22
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,192
<i>[Man] Sicily, eh?</i>
<i>I suppose it was the obvious choice.</i>

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
Too obvious.

24
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,197
Here we are, all along the North African coast,
except for Tunisia...

25
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,200
and here's Jerry opposite
from the Pyrenees to Greece.

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,003
He knows we're coming, and he knows
we're almost certain to come through here.

27
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,507
All he's got to do
is to sit and wait for us.

28
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,010
As a king's counsel, Montagu,
and a leading member of the bar...

29
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,013
you've sometimes defended a man
in peril of his life.

30
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,015
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,452
Well, here's your chance
to defend thousands of men.

32
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,445
If we land in Sicily now,
we shall have 30% casualties getting ashore.

33
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,460
We sit in offices
and talk about casualties...

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,463
as though they were just figures
on a bit of paper.

35
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,456
I take it the chiefs of staff
want us to think up a cover plan.

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,737
One that'll makeJerry think
we're going somewhere else.

37
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,806
Greece, Sardinia...

38
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,774
the south of France.

39
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,310
I'm told Corsica is very pleasant.

40
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,312
But with respect, sir...

41
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,314
the Germans know we need Sicily.

42
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,316
They must go on defending it.

43
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,819
But we may make them
thin their defenses a bit...

44
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,822
if they think the main attack
is coming somewhere else.

45
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,815
You and your outfit
must drop everything for it.

46
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,928
If we can getJerry...

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,930
to move one single battalion...

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,432
a battery, or even a gun...

49
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,435
it's going to save a lot of lives.

50
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,428
[Man On P.A.] Now, to your left
you will see a further wave of aircraft.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,233
<i>Here you see the multicolored chutes</i>
<i>which are dropping before you.</i>

52
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,181
<i>Ah, there's one taking a short cut.</i>

53
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:46,174
<i>That's what we call</i>
<i>jumping to a conclusion, gentlemen.</i>

54
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,456
Just for a moment
I thought someone had had it.

55
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,459
Me too. Those things aren't nearly as safe
as they're made out to be.

56
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,462
I don't think there's
anything for us here, George.

57
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,966
Any scheme that means using troops
would take far too long to set up.

58
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,959
Next phase:
"Use of natural cover."

59
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,697
Let's slide out.

60
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,846
Monty, that parachute
that didn't open—

61
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,450
Suppose we were to drop a fellow
out of a plane over enemy territory...

62
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,453
with papers on him saying
we were going to invade Greece...

63
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,455
and <i>his</i> parachute didn't open up.

64
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,457
The Germans would find him dead...

65
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,459
and the papers...

66
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,961
and "A-ha," they'd say, "look at this.

67
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,964
"Officer with secret papers,
parachute didn't open—

68
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,966
they're going to invade Greece."

69
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,969
Do we tell the man who jumps
that the parachute doesn't work...

70
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,972
or is it a sort of practical joke
that he finds out on the way down?

71
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,975
Well, of course it'd have to be somebody
we didn't mind much about.

72
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,977
Are you volunteering?

73
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,979
No, George, it wouldn't work.

74
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,482
What about using a man already dead?

75
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,485
The autopsy would show he'd been dead
before he hit the ground.

76
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,755
Let's get back to the office
and think again.

77

<i>[Bells Pealing]</i>

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,530
If those boys of yours drink any more coffee,
they won't be able to sleep.

79
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,533
That won't worry them.
They gave up sleeping two days ago.

80
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,526
[Laughs]

81
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,510
Will you come and get it
while it's hot, sir?

82
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,224
Monty, what we really want...

83
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,226
is something absolutely simple.

84
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,729
- The simpler the better.
- Good boy, George. You're absolutely right.

85
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,733
How about this? Supposing we issue
Greek dictionaries to all the troops.

86
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,604
Why should we do that unless we intend
to invade Greece? That'd fool 'em.

87
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,940
I'd make it Eskimo dictionaries.
That would <i>really</i> fool them.

88
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,443
Pam, first thing in the morning...

89
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,446
I want you to get me
the fullest possible details...

90
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,448

91
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,450
Gibraltar
and the Portuguese border.

92
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,486
- Between where, sir?
- Gibraltar and the Portuguese border.

93
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,388
- Yes, sir.
- Going for a swim?

94
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,390
No.
Sardine fishing.

95
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,393
Now, Pam, it's getting late.
You'd better get off home.

96
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,396
Are you sure you don't want
some sandwiches before I go?

97
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,399
My dear child,
you must try not to be so greedy.

98
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,903
You think of nothing but my stomach.
Go on, hop it.

99
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,896
Leave the coffee.

100
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,911
Poor Pam.
How she does fuss over you.

101
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,904
Close the door, George.

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,854
Come here.

103
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,858

104
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,860
Yes?

105
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,863
It won't work the way you had it, but...

106
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,866

- Does it scare you?
- I get used to it.

- You'll ring me when you get back.
- As soon as I can.

You won't ever forget to ring,

- I'll ring, Lu.

00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,663
Or if anything stops me, Larry'll ring.

00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,656
- What do you mean, if anything stops you?
- Oh, just anything.

141
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,682
- Home long?
- About 7:00.

152

That's what I'm afraid you'll do—
fall in love with someone you can't have.

153
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,715
- Don't do it, Lucy. You'll only get hurt.
- Who, me?

154
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,585
Lucy, the languishing librarian?
Not a chance.

155
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,578

00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,425

00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,050
- Meantime, may we get on?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,052
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

170
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,987
Thank you.

171
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,989
Sir Bernard...

172
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,993
may I ask you some rather odd questions
without explaining why I'm asking them?

173
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,995
You may.

174
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,499
Suppose I wanted
to put a dead body in the sea...

175
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,002
let it float ashore and have it accepted
by the people who find it...

176
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,506
as the victim of an air crash at sea.

177
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:24,499
What sort of body would I need?

178
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,549
Do you want the body
to show any physical damage?

179
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,052
No.

180
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:37,045
- But to look as though he'd died by drowning.
- Yes.

181
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,827
- Could he be wearing a Mae West?
- Yes.

182
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,830
- How long in the water?
- Two, three days.

183
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,823
It rather depends on
the information I get from you.

184
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,838
I would say your best bet would be
someone who died of pneumonia.

185
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,840
When somebody dies of pneumonia...

186
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,343
there's a certain amount
of fluid in the lungs.

187
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,346
After a few days in the water,
it would be almost impossible...

188
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,782
to say that he'd
not died of drowning.

189
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,785
That is, unless one
had reason to be suspicious.

190
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,821
You mean, if you were suspicious
you'd probably spot it?

191
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,923
I would, if it came here.

192
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,916
But I don't suppose
it <i>would</i> come here, would it?

193
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,598
I don't want to ask
any awkward questions...

194
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,601
but at what sort of place
might this body be found?

195
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,504
Shall we say... Spain.

196
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,506
You wouldn't have any trouble there.

197
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,508
I don't think there's anyone in Spain...

198
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,845
who would examine the body closely enough
to spot the sort of thing that I have in mind.

199
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,181
One other thing, Sir Bernard.

200
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,184
If we had to keep the body
for a week or two...

201
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,553
how would we stop it
from decomposing?

202
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,555
Refrigeration.

203
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,558
<i>And while it was</i>
<i>being transported?</i>

204
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,551
I would suggest some sort of
airtight canister packed with dry ice.

205
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,330
Why dry ice?

206
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,034
It would melt and give off carbon dioxide
which would dispel the air.

207
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,037
It's the oxygen in air
that causes decomposition.

208
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,030
It would be possible to store a body
in a canister in this way for quite a while.

209
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,744
Well, thank you very much.
That gives me a start.

210
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,748
Sir Bernard, you won't mind if we
come back to you on some of these points?

211
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,750
By all means.

212
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,752
Incidentally,
on this question of refrigeration...

213
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,656
you'd better have a word with my man Adams,
the fellow who brought you in.

214
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,658
He has all the facilities here...

215
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,161
and I can arrange for him
to look after things for you.

216
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,163
That would help a great deal.

217
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,156
If I were in your place, I shouldn't be able
to resist asking what all this is about.

218
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,937
Lieutenant Acres,
if you <i>were</i> in my place...

219
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,940
you would have to remember
what we used to be told in the nursery.

220
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,944
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
Go on, George.

221
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,946
Good-bye.

222
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,939
Thank you very much.

223
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,221
Well, so far, so good.

224
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,214
That part of it seems to be practical anyway,
provided we can get a body.

225
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,762
Oh, any decent undertaker
will fix us up with a body.

226
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,755
I don't think that's a problem.

227
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,493
So that in essence, sir,
the idea is this:

228
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,675
The body of a dead man,
dressed as an officer...

229
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,178
will be put into the sea
from a submarine off the coast of Spain...

230
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,514
near Huelva.

231
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,517
On the body will be
top secret documents...

232
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,510
or a letter suggesting
our main attack will be Greece...

233
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,391
not Sicily.

234
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,393
The body will drift ashore.

235
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,396
It will be picked up
and the papers found.

236
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,399
The impression will be
that it is the body of an officer...

237
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,401
who was traveling by plane...

238
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,405
and was drowned
when his plane crashed into the sea.

239
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,942
Hmm.

240
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,945
- Why Huelva?
- Two reasons, sir.

241
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,948
First, there are strong inshore currents...

242
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
and a prevailing onshore wind...

243
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
which will almost certainly
carry the body ashore.

244
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,946
Second, one of the sharpest German agents
in Spain operates in that district.

245
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,951
But the beauty of the whole scheme, sir,
is that it involves only one man...

246
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,397
and therefore might be possible...

247
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,390
in the ridiculously
short time allowed us.

248
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,539
May I have your views, sir?

249
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,543
In over 30 years of intelligence work
I've never heard of anything like it.

250
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,212
Neither have the Germans.

251
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,205
It's the most outrageous, disgusting,
preposterous, not to say barbaric idea.

252
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,153
But work out full details...

253
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,156
and be on hand at the war cabinet offices
at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon.

254
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,158
Thank you, sir.

255
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,160
You'll need a code name.

256
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,153
You can have... Jumbo,
Trader, Wigwam...

257
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,200
<i>Mincemeat, Jubilee</i>—

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,193
With your permission, sir, Mincemeat.

259
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,430
Operation Mincemeat.
Comments and criticisms. Admiral.

260
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,911
Well, it's an ingenious idea,
of course.

261
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,415
Up to now, I've thought of four major ways
where it could go wrong.

262
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,550
Four?
I was going to say 40.

263
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,488
First, your body may not oblige
by drifting ashore.

264
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,291
Next, it may simply be handed over
to the British consul for burial.

265
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,794
<i>Next, even if the papers are examined...</i>

266
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,796
<i>they may not leak to the Germans.</i>

267
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,566
And finally, if they do leak to the Germans,
the Germans may guess they're a fake.

268
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,568
That's all quite true, of course.

269
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,071
There are ways
in which it can go wrong.

270
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,274
But that is so of any operation of war,
and certainly any deception plan.

271
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,277
- Dickie.
- I'm for the idea in principle.

272
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,279
But why not the south of France?

273
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,282
<i>Then you'd be sure that the Germans</i>
<i>would get the documents.</i>

274
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,284
<i>After all, Spain is neutral.</i>

275
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,287
Sir, perhaps you would allow Lt. Cmdr. Montagu,
who put forward the idea...

276
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,289
to answer
Adm. Mountbatten's question.

277
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,291
<i>Well, Montagu?</i>

278
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,293
The reason for choosing Spain, sir...

279
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,296
is that we don't want
the Germans themselves to get the body...

280
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,932
because we don't want it
examined too closely.

281
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,935
But forgive me, even if we could
get over these obvious snags...

282
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,937
surely we're being far too ambitious.

283
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,940
The man might be carrying letters
at a lower level...

284
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,933
but you can't expect the Germans to swallow
fake letters from the vice chief to Gen. Alexander.

285
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,448
<i>From their point of view,</i>
<i>it'd be altogether too good to be true.</i>

286
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,441
Montagu, surely the first question
German intelligence will ask themselves...

287
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,456
is why the letter wasn't sent
through the normal channels...

288
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,825
instead of by this—
this dead gentleman.

289
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,827
It was my intention, sir...

290
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,820
to ask for a letter of a personal and private type
from you to General Alexander.

291
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,001
It might contain
certain references to other people...

292
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,004
which you would hardly want
to go through ordinary channels.

293
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,607
You mean saying someone important
is a nitwit or something.

294
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
- [All Chuckling]
- Yes, sir.

295
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,602
There are, in fact, a number of jokes
already in circulation that might be suitable.

296
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,316
Why is this officer flying to Africa?

297
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,818
Where is he going?
What's his job?

298
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,821
We'd like to make him a major
in the Royal Marines, sir...

299
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,657
on your staff at Combined Operations.

300
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,127
He's an expert on landing craft.

301
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
You are lending him
to General Eisenhower...

302
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
to whom he also carries a letter.

303
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,600
- Oh, I write a letter as well?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,602
He seems to have jobs for all of us.

305
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,605
- Can my letter be rude about somebody too?
- [All Chuckling]

306
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,541
You realize that
if the Germans see through this...

307
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,544
you're pinpointing Sicily
as the place where we <i>are</i> going.

308
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,514
- Quite right.
- We've got a big agenda. We must get on.

309
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,516
This is an imaginative plan...

310
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,352
but obviously it needs careful consideration
or we may do more harm than good.

311
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,355
<i>I think we'd better</i>
<i>leave it for the moment.</i>

312
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,348
The time is very short, sir,
and we must get going as soon as possible.

313
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,529
We're aware of that.

314
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,532
We'll put it on the agenda
for the next meeting.

315
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,535
<i>- [Bells Pealing]</i>
<i>- [Sergeant] Attention.!</i>

316
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,538
I have a feeling it would be easier
to convince the Germans...

317
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,540
than it is to persuade our masters.

318
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,543
It's no use losing your temper.
They've got a lot of other things to think about.

319
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,546
Then why can't they make up their minds
and give us a plain yes or no?

320
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,548
They want to mull it over,
quite rightly.

321
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,552
You'll just have to be patient. The moment
they agree, if they do, you can go ahead.

322
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,545
Till then, you'll just have to wait.

323
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,397
Sticky?

324
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,400
Like trying to swim
through a barrel of syrup.

325
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,403
They just want to stand
and chew their cud...

326
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,406
and gaze into the distance
with big, brown eyes.

327
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,409
What are we supposed to do,
get on with our knitting?

328
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,412
I'll wager that in the end
they won't turn it down.

329
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,415
I'm going to take a chance
and jump the gun.

330
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,417
You go and get a body.

331
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,420
I'll start working out

- Just outside Brussels.

Yes, I'll hold on.

George, it's on. We've got the right of way
from the old man himself.

"Let the plan be implemented!"

00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,079
I've got a socking great blister
on my foot.

384
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,082
I've walked more than 50 miles
in the last two days...

385
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,084
I didn't go to bed at all last night...

386
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,586
and it doesn't matter whether
he shoots it down or not...

387
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,588
because the whole thing
is utterly impracticable.

388
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,590
- What?
- Napoo. Won't go. Not on.

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,592
- Hello? Yes.
- Why not?

390
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,595
Because, Monty, there simply
isn't any way of getting a body.

391
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,099
You wave an airy hand and say, "George, go and
get a body," as though there was nothing to it.

- Well, you try.
- Nonsense!

393
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,103
There are hospitals,
nursing homes, mortuaries—

394
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,106
- I've tried 'em! Not a hope.
- Is he at the hospital now?

395
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,542
You see, Monty,
every body belongs to somebody...

396
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,044
and it isn't a thing
people want messed about.

397
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,547
What about the fellow
in St. Luke's Hospital?

398
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,049
Changed his mind
at the last moment and recovered.

399
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,052
- Very unreliable type.
- Yes, we'll come round immediately.

400
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,555
- Have you tried Spilsbury?
- Yes, he gets bodies.

401
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,057
But they're special ones that the police
think have been murdered...

402
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,059
and he wants them himself.

403
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,061
- Sir, I think I'm onto something.
- Where?

404
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,063
In a small hospital
in St. John's Wood.

405
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:29,056
I said you'd come and see the father.
There doesn't seem to be anybody else.

406
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,907
- When did he die?
- 3:00 this morning.

407
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,909
- Pneumonia?
- Bronchial pneumonia.

408
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,412
Are there any other relatives
beside the father?

409
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,915
I don't think so. He was an only child,
and I gather the wife's dead.

410
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,908
- Is the father with him now?
- He is waiting for you.

411
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,422
You wait here.

412
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,415
I think I'd rather
deal with this by myself.

413
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,706
Perhaps you'd like to sit over there
while you're waiting.

414
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,208
- Thank you.
- I'll come back in a few minutes.

415
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,201
Right.

416
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,054
It has been explained to you...

417
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,390
that, for reasons of security...

418
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,393
we cannot tell you
why we are asking you this?

419
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,396
Yes.
That has been explained.

420
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:35,400
But if there is any question
you wish to ask me, sir...

421
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,237
I will answer it if I can.

422
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,230
I'll try not to embarrass you.

423
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,748
Can you assure me,
Commander Montagu...

424
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,083
as an officer and a gentleman...

425
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,086
that if I agree to your request...

426
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:59,079
my son's body will be treated decently
and with respect?

427
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,594
I give you my word.

428
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,298
His name will never be revealed?

429
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,100
Never.

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,102
And finally...

431
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,105
his body will have Christian burial?

432
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,208
I cannot absolutely promise that...

433
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,201
but I am fairly certain of it.

434
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,785
I was never the one...

435
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,788
nor was he...

436
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,781
to mind very much about
the last resting place of the body...

437
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,852
being more concerned
with the repose of the spirit.

438
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,968
But still...

439
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,972
I would like to be sure
that this thing you are going to do...

440
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,808
is good...

441
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,178
and worthy of him.

442
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,513
I can assure you that...

443
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:59,506
this is an opportunity for your son
to do a great thing for England.

444
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,355
My son, sir, was a Scotsman...

445
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:07,348
and very proud of it.

446
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,028
I beg your pardon.

447
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,397
Never mind.

448
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,399
We're used to that.

449
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,392
You English always talk about England
when you mean Britain.

450
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,906
Good-bye, son.

451
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,688
I don't know what they want with you...

452
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,558
but it doesn't matter now...

453
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,894
because...

454
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,498
you're not here anymore.

455
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,633
You're somewhere else...

456
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,626
and at peace.

457
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,674
Good day to you.

458
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,088
I have no son now...

459
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:14,081
but you have a body.

460
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,744
I think William Martin
is a good name.

461
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,746
One naval identity card...

462
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,283
in the name of
Captain, Acting Major, William Martin...

463
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,285
Royal Marines.

464
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,621
Born in Cardiff, 1907.

465
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:47,614
I thought of Glasgow,
but I don't want to say he's a Scot.

466
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,929
Also, a combined Operations Headquarters
pass in the same name.

467
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,666
You'll need a photograph of him, sir,
for the identity card.

468
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,668
So we shall.

469
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,671
It's only a passport photograph.
It needn't look like him.

470
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,607
Now, we need various articles
to go in his pockets—

471
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,609
cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys—

472
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,112
- What's he carrying the documents in?
- Briefcase.

473
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,114
But he's floating in the water.

474
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,616
Has he got it in his hand, or what?

475
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,619
What about one of those things
that bank messengers have?

476
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,590
Goes around the waist, comes down
the sleeve and clips onto the briefcase.

477
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,592
Get one, and we'll see.

478
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,595
And he'll have to have
a wallet, money, wristwatch.

479
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,597
- George.
- Hmm?

480
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,600
I think we're attacking this
the wrong way round.

481
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,870
Wallet, money, wristwatch,
they're all right and necessary.

482
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,373
But, after all,
he must have had some private life.

483
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,377
There ought to be something
more intimate on him when they find him.

484
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,181
Personal things like photographs
or maybe some private letters.

485
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,451
I'll tell you what. He'd better have
a girlfriend with a love letter from her.

486
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,454
That's a good idea, but we'll have
to make it really convincing.

487
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,557
Hmm.

488
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,659
We'll get Pam to write it for us.

Hi, Pam.
How goes it?

502
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,544
Little bit tired.

503
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,546
Pam, I've got some news for you...

504
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,549
and maybe it's going
to make you angry.

505
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,051
Tell me later, Lucy,
when I've done this.

506
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,053
Okay.
I'll go make some coffee.

507
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,556
It's already done.
It's on the hot plate.

508
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,559
That's what I like about you—
you're so inefficient.

509
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,552
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

510
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,935
"Dearest Willie"?

511
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,938
Have you ever tried writing? That's the
greatest opening I've ever heard in my life.

512
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,940
Don't fool.
It isn't a real letter.

513
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,942
It's just something I've got to do.

514
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,112
Love letters are always something
you've got to do. What's it for then?

515
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,115
It's part of a story
I've got to make up.

516
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,108
Well, let me help you. I'm completely
undiscovered and cheap. My work, I mean.

517
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,855
- What's the story?
- Oh, it's very ordinary.

518
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,857
They've just got engaged.

519
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,359
He's going off on a dangerous job...

520
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,361
and she's writing to him.

521
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,363
Oh, that one.

522
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,866
It's the start that's sticking me.

523
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,102
"Dearest Willie—"
His name's Willie Martin.

524
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,104
"It was lovely seeing you."

525
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,107
Willie Martin.
What a name.

526
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:27,100
"Dearest Willie."

527
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,707
Take dictation.

528
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,792
Darling...

529
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,261
when you went away tonight...

530
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,464
something went with you.

531
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,934
<i>I think it must have been my heart...</i>

532
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,927
<i>because now I'm cold and empty.</i>

533
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,575
It's always bad when you go away...

534
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,811
but it was worse tonight...

535
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,804
because the day was so good.

536
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,118
You shouldn't have bought the ring...

537
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,687
and I knew you shouldn't.

538
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,757
And you did because you love me...

539
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:16,561
and I let you because I love you.

540
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,554
There isn't much more than that
to be had from any day.

541
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,267
<i>I won't wear it, darling.</i>

542
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,004
I told you I wouldn't.

543
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,206
Because if I did...

544
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,708
that would mean that you were real...

545
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,710
that you belonged to me...

546
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,114
and that they couldn't
take you away from me...

547
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,250
whereas now they can send you away...

548
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,243
and leave me to wonder
if I'll ever see you again...

549
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,257
or whether I may wake up...

550
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,694
and find I'd dreamed you.

551
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,929
[Gasps]

552
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,932
Maybe there'll be a time
when it's all over...

553
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,636
and you're still there
and real and lovely.

554
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,672
Then I'll put your ring on
and wear it...

555
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,665
and wear it until I die.

556
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,903
Oh, God, darling,
take care of yourself.

557
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,485
As if you ever could or would.

558
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,321
I suppose I mean...

559
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,324
O God, take care of you.

560
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,860
I love you.

561
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,853
I love you.

562
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,103
This is really wonderful, Pam.

563
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,105
I had no idea you were a writer.

564
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,607
- I'm afraid I didn't do it, sir.
- Oh?

565
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,111
A friend of mine did it.
I only altered a word here and there.

566
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
That's why I've signed it Lucy.

567
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,615
- You didn't tell her anything.
- Of course not.

568
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,118
- She did it just for fun?
- Yes, sir.

569
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,120
- Just for fun.
- Good.

570
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,622
- Oh, George, have you seen this?
- Yes.

571
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,625
- I always told you there were hidden depths.
- Mr. Acres, I have—

572
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,628
Never mind, my dear.
It happens to the nicest people.

573
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,465
Oh, by the way, I fixed the letter
from the bank about Willie's overdraft.

574
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,467
The manager was very helpful.

575
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,769
- I told him just enough.
- Fine.

576
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,273
Tell me, does this alleged girlfriend of yours
wear thick spectacles?

577
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,275
No.

578
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,777
- Reasonably good to look at?
- Very.

579
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,480
Ah, then we want her photograph
for Willie's wallet.

580
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,473
- It doesn't have to be her photograph.
<i>- Oh, don't spoil it, Monty.</i>

581
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,544
I want to see
this passionate Lucy creature.

582
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,991
<i>What are you doing?</i>

583
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,984
It's got to look as though
it's been in his pocket for several days.

584
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,465
Can we get a snap of this girl?

585
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,467
- I should think so, sir.
- Good.

586
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,469
Now about dates.

587
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,972
There's got to be something on him
that will show when he left.

588
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,776
I think I can fix to get a receipted bill
from the Naval and Military Club.

589
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,778
He stayed there on his last night.

590
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,281
And he went to the theater.
Final celebration.

591
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,783
He has the stubs of the tickets
in his pocket.

592
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,819
Item: Two theater tickets
for the night of...

593
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,821
April 22.

594
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,823
- Dress circle.
- Make it four.

595
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,825
And for something worth seeing.

596
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,828
And what's going on
in that bright little mind?

597
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,831
You've got to buy the tickets anyway,
and Willie can't use them.

598
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,833
We might as well.

599
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,836
There are three of us already,
and with Pam's alleged girlfriend—

600
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,838
I understand, dear chap.
Mmm.

601
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,831
Make it four.

602
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,846
I've hacked it about a bit,
as we agreed.

603
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,850
It now reads, "General,
the Honorable Sir Harold R.O.G. Alexander.

604
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,221
"My dear Alex, I am taking advantage
of this opportunity...

605
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,991
"to send you a personal letter
by hand of one of Mountbatten's officers...

606
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,161
to put you in the picture regarding
our intention in the Mediterranean."

607
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,030
- Good.
<i>- Then comes the personal stuff.</i>

608
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,023
Then, "The plan is that the 5th
and 56th divisions will be reinforced...

609
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,771
and form the main force
for the attack on Greece."

610
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,274
Then a lot about possible landing points.

611
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,377
Then,
"In the western Mediterranean...

612
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,946
"the heavy bombardment
of Sicily will continue...

613
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,449
"as it is necessary
to make the enemy think...

614
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,951
that this island is still
our main objective."

615
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,688
- That's exactly right, sir.
<i>- And the rest as we had it before.</i>

616
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,691
Well, here you are.
Let's hope it foxes them.

617
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,461
- I won't touch it, sir, if you don't mind.
- Why?

618
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,454
I want only two sets of fingerprints on it—
yours and your secretary's.

619
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,958
- What do you want me to do with it then?
- Fold it, sir.

620
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,268
As sharp folds as you can.

621
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,109
Now put it in the envelope.

622
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:14,125
Now, if you'll wrap a piece of paper
around it so that I can handle it...

623
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,118
I'll take it out to your secretary
and get her to seal it.

624
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,567
- Thank you, sir.
- Any more chores?

625
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,736

01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:52,617
- Mincemeat swallowed whole.
- Mincemeat?

841
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,249
Well?

842
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,585
There's nothing new
from Madrid, Herr Admiral.

843
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:18,221
The führer has told his conference
that the documents...

844
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,289
are undoubtedly genuine.

845
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:23,359
- You mean he doesn't doubt them.
- He's quite sure.

846
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,128
The führer, of course,
has certain advantages...

847
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,699
over mere intelligence officers
like you and me, Frederik.

848
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,134
He has his intuition...

849
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,438
whereas we have to
rely on our brains.

850
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:39,431
- And he's sure God is on his side.
- But you are not?

851
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,945
I do not believe
that God is on my side to the extent...

852
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:46,282
of handing me the enemy's plans.

853
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:50,275
There's no way in which we can check
the genuineness of these papers.

854
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,550
<i>Those certainly appear to be</i>
<i>Nye's and Mountbatten's signatures.</i>

855
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:06,491
The question is whether
what is in the letters is true.

856
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:12,097
[Chuckles] And only the people
who wrote them could tell us.

857
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,410
But we can do something...

858
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,079
to check the genuineness of the bearer.

859
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,215
In what sense, Herr Admiral?

860
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:23,208
We know a great deal about
the lamented Major Martin, Frederik.

861
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:27,646
We know the address
of his club, of his bank.

862
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,893
We even know about his debts.

863
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:34,886
I think someone had better ask
a few discreet questions in London...

864
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,601
just to make sure
there was such a man.

- Dublin.

you'll see a plate with a telephone number.

Memorize it,
but don't write it down.

ring that number for a cab to pick you up

892
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,928

Go straight there and wait for me.

894
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,866
But don't ring unless it's important.
You're not under my orders.

895
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:54,170
I'm not responsible for you,
and I have troubles enough of my own.

896
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,406
My instructions simply are to meet you
and deliver you and your luggage. That's all.

897
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,810
I doubt if I shall bother you much.

898
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:04,803
It's nothing to do with me,
but why were you chosen for this job?

899
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,874

01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:14,183
- Never let it be said I let a lady carry for me.
- Oh, you're all the same.

913
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,919
I always say there's
nobody like the Irish for manners.

914
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:19,321
My granddad was Irish.
He came from the north.

915
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,957
But as he said,
"What does it matter, north or south?

916
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,760
We're all Irish,
and all the Irish are kings' sons."

917
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,997
[Laughing] Now, look,
I've put you on the first floor here.

918
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,990
That's the bathroom and the necessary,
and this is your room.

926
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,363
Oh, I almost forgot.

927
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:05,356
In case you should want to be out late in the
evening, I'll put the key on the hall table.

Good morning.

- Uh, um, I'd like some khaki shirts, please.

937

- Made to measure or ready-made, sir?
- Ready-made.

938

- Collar size?
- Sixteen.

I think you'll like these, sir.

940
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,085
They're very fine poplin.
Practically prewar quality.

941
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,821
- Oh, yes, yes. They're very nice indeed.
- It's a beautiful shirt, sir.

942
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:41,690
- But they're not really the ones I had in mind.
- No, sir?

943
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,327
No, you sold some to a friend of mine
a few weeks ago.

01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,731
Um, Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.

945
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:52,724
- They were cotton with separate collars.
- I know the one you mean.

946
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,740
Just take a look at those, will you, sir?

947
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,743
Separate collars. Cotton.

948
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,745
- Oh, good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

949
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,738
- Won't keep you a moment.
- Right.

01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,652
- Yes, these look like the ones.
- Good, sir.

951
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,955
But I'm not quite sure.

952
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,948
Uh, would it be troubling you too much
to look up Major Martin's account—

953
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,595
Look, sir, if your friend
got his shirts from us...

954
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,498
and if they were cotton with separate collars,
those are certainly the ones.

955
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,068
- We haven't any others in stock.
- Oh.

01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,438
Well, I'll not doubt the word

- Thank you very much, sir.

<i>- So I said to this chap, if you can't let us have</i>—
- Excuse me.

- Yes, that's right.

Do you happen to have seen him lately

There's a Major Martin who's a gunner, sir.

[Chuckling] No, that'd hardly be him.
He's in the Royal Marines.

- Eh?
- The Royal Marines!

973
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,302
I don't think I know
the gentleman personally, sir.

01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,704
Is he a regular officer or temporary?

975
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,106
Oh, now, there I couldn't be sure.

976
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,909
If he's a temporary,
I probably shouldn't know him, sir.

01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:44,246
There's a lot of members now

- Eh?

983
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,933
- Surely that's odd if he's a member!
- Not necessarily, sir.

we're a bit behind with things these days.

If he's a new member,
he may not be on the file yet.

1001
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:29,117
- There's a call on my outside line.
- Yes, sir?

1002
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:33,110
- Get through to the exchange and have it traced.
- Yes, sir.

1003
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:37,448
[Rings]

1004
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,695
- Hello.
- Is that the manager?

1005
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:43,031
Speaking.

1006
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,434
I-I wonder if you could help me.

1007
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:49,427
My name is Phillips, and I'm making
some inquiries about Major William Martin.

1008
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:54,065
- Yes?
- I believe he was a customer of yours.

1009
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:58,113
Only the poor fellow's dead,
and as an old friend...

1010
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,682
I'm trying to help clear up his affairs.

1011
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:03,485
I see.

1012
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:07,478
I'm sure you'll understand it's an absolute rule
of the bank not to discuss a client's affairs...

1013
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,459
with anyone
but his accredited representatives.

1014
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,028
Certainly not on the telephone.

1015
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,597
But I am onto the right branch,
I take it.

1016
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:19,534
I should have thought the best thing
would be if you could drop in and see me.

1017
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:23,527
I'm pretty full up this morning,
but this afternoon's all right...

1018
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:28,432
if you'd like to come in at, say,
quarter past 2:00 and ask for me.

1019
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:32,981
Yes. Yes, I suppose
that would be a good idea.

1020
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,717
- A quarter past 2:00.
- Yes.

1021
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:39,710
All right.

1022
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,373
You were very smart
to get this, Mr. Emberton.

1023
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:01,276
My secretary often takes notes
of important calls.

1024
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,345
You say he had a slight accent?

1025
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,415
Yes, but, uh, not a foreign accent,
if you follow me.

1026
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,817
It's difficult to tell on the telephone.

1027
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,553
I should have said he was English,
but possibly from the west country.

1028
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:14,122
- Did you trace the call?
- It came from a public telephone booth.

1029
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,693
Obviously, yet when you
suggested an appointment, he agreed.

1030
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,529
He agreed, but he didn't sound
particularly enthusiastic.

1031
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,432
Is there any chance
that this might be a coincidence?

1032
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:27,202
William Martin is quite a common name.
He may have just mistaken the bank.

1033
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,504
- It's possible, but—
- But not probable.

1034
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:33,175
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Emberton.
You've handled the whole thing beautifully.

1035
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,744
Frankly, I don't think
the man will turn up.

1036
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:39,481
However, we can't afford to take any chances.
We'll both be back at 2:00.

1037
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:43,485
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Thank you.

1038
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,354
- He's a good chap.
- Very good.

1039
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:50,347
Look, George, if there's somebody around
who can ring up Willie Martin's bank...

1040
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:54,418
it means thatJerry's putting the whole thing
under a microscope.

1041
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,723
Now, where, if anywhere,
is there a weak link?

1042
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,995
I'm going to Scotland Yard to talk
to General Colbourne of the special branch.

1043
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,811
Of course, a voice from a telephone booth
isn't much of a starting point.

1044
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,813
I realize that, sir.

1045
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:15,806
I wondered whether you'd had any ripple on
the waters recently that might give us a line.

1046
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,520
I don't think so.

1047
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,289
There's a gentleman just arrived from Sweden
we're rather interested in...

1048
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,825
but he's nothing to do
with your Major Martin.

1049
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:27,763
It's certain he won't come to the bank, but we'd
better have a couple of your men just in case.

1050
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,632
Yes, of course.
We must certainly be in on it.

1051
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,535
We always like to make
a new friend if we can.

1052
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,937
Besides, you may be wrong.
He may turn up.

1053
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,507
My guess is that he's only over here
for this one job.

1054
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,076
He knows we haven't
got our tabs on him.

1055
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:45,069
He's the sort of man
who might take chances.

Pity. Do you think
he suspected Emberton?

- You know why I'm phoning, don't you, Lu?

Sure. Sure.

Oh, no, he's gone.

- [Gasps]
- Good evening.

1082
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:35,259
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but the door was open.

1083
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,772
Yes.
What do you want?

1084
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:41,765
I'm making some inquiries
about a friend of mine, William Martin.

1085
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:47,237
- William Martin?
- Yes.

1086
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:51,575
- Yes, will you come in?
- Thank you.

1087
01:24:57,692 --> 01:24:59,928
Won't you sit down?

1088
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:03,264
Willie's death was a great shock to me.

1089
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:07,257
Yes, it was a great pity.

1090
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:12,006
Forgive me, but I take it
you're not his fiancée.

1091
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,542
No. I hardly knew him.

1092
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,612
Only I understood
he'd just recently become engaged...

1093
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:20,381
and that his fiancée
lived at this address.

1094
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,383
That's why I came.

1095
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:26,376
Yes, well, that's the girl who
lives here with me— Lucy Sherwood.

1096
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,914
Oh, will you have a cigarette?

1097
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:38,422
Thank you.

1098
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:42,504
Lucy Sherwood.
That's right. I remember.

1099
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:46,497
I'll get you a light.

1100
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:49,244
I should have liked to see her.

1101
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:52,380
- I'm afraid she's out tonight.
- When will she be back?

1102
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,683
Not until late, but if you could
come again tomorrow...

1103
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:58,987
I'd say that you'd called
and that you'd be coming back.

1104
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,980
Yes.

1105
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:09,119
I knew Willie right from the time
when he was a boy in Cardiff.

1106
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:12,700
Did he come from Cardiff?
I didn't know.

1107
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,936
Is his fiancée very upset?

1108
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:18,239
Well, naturally.

1109
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,808
Well, I don't want to take up your time...

1110
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,711
but I do want to—
to do everything I can to help.

1111
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,281
So if you would like to give his fiancée
my name and address—

1112
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:30,018
- Your address?
- Yes.

1113
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:34,011
Perhaps you'd care to take it down.

1114
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,969

Introduce your handsome friend.

- Hello there.

Mr. O'Reilly is making inquiries
about Willie Martin.

1128
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,588
Willie Martin?

1129
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:44,581
Willie Martin.
Dearest Willie?

1130
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:47,895
It's no good making inquiries
about him, mister.

1131
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:51,888
Willie Martin doesn't exist.

1132
01:27:56,170 --> 01:28:00,163
At least he's dead,
which is the same thing.

1133
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:02,710
That's right, isn't it?
That's true.

1134
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:06,703
<i>He's dead, so he doesn't exist.</i>

1135
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:11,074
It's the same with all these boys.
Here today, gone tomorrow.

1136
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:14,322
What's real about that?

1137
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:17,492
I was very sorry to hear of his death.

1138
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,261
Why should you be sorry?

1139
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:22,830
You weren't in love
with him, were you?

1140
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:26,467
He didn't give you a ring.
I never wore it.

1141
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:29,337

<i>Ever.! Ever.!</i>

1143
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:37,067
- Lucy.
- I knew him in the old days in Cardiff.

1144
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:41,471
Did you, now?
And I'll bet you knew his old man too.

1145
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:45,542
His ma and his sister
and the whole shooting match.

1146
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:49,657
Well, I didn't.
They were just photographs.

1147
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:53,650
The usual photographs
with folks looking the way folks do.

1148
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,698
But I never knew 'em.

1149
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:59,600
In the time, I barely knew <i>him.</i>

1150
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,593
Three months.
What sort of time's that?

[Sobs]

1152
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:13,970
And yet I knew him well enough.

1153
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,751
And then they took him away from me...

1154
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:19,821
and killed him in the sea.

1155
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:23,524
"Down, down into the sea...

1156
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,027

1158
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,465
<i>Do you know Tennyson?</i>

1159
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:32,867
Why should you?

1160
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:36,037
Why should I know Tennyson?

1161
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,073
He almost made it.

1162
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:42,810
Darling, I dreamed you.
