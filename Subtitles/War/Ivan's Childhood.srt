16
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,235
Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

17
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,234
What is it?

18
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,234
We detained someone... The lieutenant
told me to bring him to you.

19
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,152
Light the lamp.

20
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,836
He was crouching in the river,
near the bank.

21
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,670
He won't say why,
nor answer any questions.

22
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,318
He says he'll only talk
to the commander.

23
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,430
He must be very weak,
or just pretending.

24
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,596
The second lieutenant's ordered
to bring him here.

25
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,438
Stand by the stove.
Who are you?

26
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,232
First, send him out.

27
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,589
Wait outside. I'll call you.

28
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,516
Well? Say something.
Where are you from?

29
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,438
I'm Bondarev.

30
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,839
Tell number 51 at HQ
that I'm here.

31
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,316
And who's number 51?

32
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,239
What HQ do you mean?
What army?

33
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,998
Code address: VCH-49550.

34
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,157
Come on, strip
and rub yourself down.

35
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,156
Here. Take it, it's dirty, anyway.

36
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,234
Take off your pants, too.
Don't be bashful.

37
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,076
What's that on your back?

38
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,950
Answer me!

39
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,958
None of your business.
And don't shout at me.

40
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,159
You just tell HQ I'm here.

41
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,552
They'll know what to do.

42
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,753
Don'tyou teach me.
You know where you are?

43
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,156
I never heard of you.

44
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,430
You'll stay here until you tell me
who you are and where you are from.

45
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,913
Are you going to speak?

46
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,432
If you want me to report aboutyou,
tell me where you are from.

47
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,156
- I'm from the other bank.
- What?

48
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,749
And how did you get here? Can you
prove thatyou're from the other bank?

49
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,076
I don't have to prove anything.

50
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,748
And stop questioning me!
Or you'll answer for it.

51
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,998
Tell number 51 at HQ
that Bondarev's here. Now!

52
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,996
They'll know what to do.

53
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,834
Number 3?

54
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,149
Comrade Captain, number 8 reporting.
I've got Bondarev here.

55
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,952
- Who?
- Bondarev.

56
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,030
He demands that I notify "Volga".

57
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,913
You mean Major Bondarev?
From the operations unit?

58
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,795
No, he's not a major.
A kid about twelve years old.

59
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,549
Are you kidding? What's the matter
with you? Are you sober?

60
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,670
Well, I thought... Comrade Captain,
he says he came from the other side.

61
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,391
Did he get here on the magic carpet?
He's just snowjobbing you.

62
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,915
Tell him

63
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,590
that if he doesn't notify number 51,
he'll be held responsible.

64
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,159
See? I reported aboutyou
as you have asked me to.

65
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,671
I was told to lock you up.

66
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,678
I asked you to tell number 51 at HQ.

67
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,598
And who'd you ring up?

68
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,430
You expect me to personally
contactArmy HQ?

69
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,439
- Let me do it, then.
- Don'tyou dare!

70
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,837
Who are you going to ring up?
Who d'you know atArmy HQ?

71
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,076
Captain Kholin
and Colonel Gryaznov.

72
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,076
Tell Colonel Gryaznov I'm here. Now.

73
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,077
Or I'll do it myself.

74
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,237
"Baikal",
get me number 51 at "Volga".

75
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,589
Comrade Colonel,
Senior Lieutenant Galtsev reporting.

76
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,756
I got Bondarev here. He demands...

77
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,752
Bondarev? Is he alone?

78
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,829
Galtsev!
Listen carefully, Galtsev.

79
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,437
No questions. No talking.
You got me?

80
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,315
Kholin!

81
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,638
Kholin's already on his way to pick
him up. Meanwhile, be nice to him.

82
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,070
See that he's comfortable.

83
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,313
Mind you, he has a hot temper.

84
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,955
And give him a pencil and paper.

85
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,630
Anything he writes send to me
immediately.

86
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,831
- You got me?
- Yes, sir!

87
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,994
Are you hungry?

88
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,679
I'll eat later.

89
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,677
I won't look.

90
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,553
Get me number 13.

91
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,080
Vassiliev, bring in two pails
of hot water.

92
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,995
What? Yes, I'm going to have
a bath.

93
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,596
Go on, wash up. I'll be back soon.

94
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,519
Thanks.

95
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,518
It's deep!

96
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,994
Of course it is.

97
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,155
If a well is deep,

98
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,830
you can see a star in it
even in the daytime.

99
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,519
Which star?

100
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,759
Any star.

101
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,749
- I see it, mom!
- Yes, there it is.

102
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,428
Why is it shining?

103
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,631
Because it's nighttime for the star.

104
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,996
That's why it's shining.

105
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,072
Is it really nighttime now?

106
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,833
No, it's daytime.

107
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,920
It's daytime for you and me,

108
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,438
but it's nighttime for the star.

109
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,994
Mommy!

110
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,198
Haven't they come yet?

111
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,438
No. Go back to sleep.
I'll wake you up when they come.

112
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,676
Were you here while I was asleep?

113
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,439
Yes. Why?

114
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,436
Did I talk in my sleep?

115
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,996
No. Why?

116
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,233
Never mind.

117
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,439
I never used to talk in my sleep.
Now I don't know.

118
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,430
I've become jittery.

119
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,315
Ivan!

120
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,074
Kholin!

121
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,235
Katasonych is waiting for you
at the hollowtree, and you're here.

122
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,153
The nazis are there.
So I swam.

123
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,557
I had cramps, and nearly drowned.

124
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,718
- You mean you swam across?
- Yes. Don't get angry.

125
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,239
They're patrolling the bank.
I couldn't find our boat in the dark.

126
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,152
They could catch me.

127
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,669
You got so skinny.
Just a bag of bones.

128
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,757
Go and bring the car up close.

129
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,234
Tell the sentry not to let anyone in.

130
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,554
Here, put this on.

131
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,914
Go on.

132
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,429
Stop!

133
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,838
Where have you been?

134
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,234
- Where are you going?
- For kerosene.

135
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,914
What for? We're leaving.

136
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,438
Here's to our meeting!

137
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,069
Kholin, Katasonych is still waiting
for me at the hollowtree.

138
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,756
To his safe return!

139
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,993
Number 2 here.

140
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,910
This is number 51. Malyshev,
remember, you had an argument?

141
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,670
They were right. We should take
the Fyodorovka direction.

142
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,996
But we've already decided...

143
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,829
Save your breath, I've heard it all.

144
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,156
- May I come in, Colonel?
- Yes, come in.

145
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,318
- What?
- I said I've heard it.

146
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,591
I have absolutely reliable,
first-hand information.

147
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,396
Waited all night for nothing, eh,
Katasonych?

148
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,834
Sit down.

149
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,916
Ivan's here.

150
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,317
He couldn't get to the bank
at the hollowtree.

151
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,670
He says there are German patrols
everywhere.

152
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,079
- How did he get here?
- He swam across.

153
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,235
Jesus!

154
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,749
A grown man might've drowned.

155
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,918
Well, that's it.
Enough of a good thing.

156
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,678
Wait, Ivan!

157
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,676
Comrade Colonel, why?

158
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,158
He said I'll be sent to the rear.
To a military school, by your order.

159
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,319
Is that true?

160
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,075
Why did you do it? You deceived me.

161
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,918
An offensive is being planned.
I can still be useful.

162
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,519
You yourself said that reconnaissance
is most important!

163
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,154
That scouts are the soul of the front.

164
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,993
You were trying to trick me!

165
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,597
I'm not going! And if you force me to,
I'll run away.

166
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,993
I'll join the partisans.

167
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,829
Ivan, you're going to a military
school. You got me?

168
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,431
And stop arguing.
I won't discuss it.

169
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,232
But I will!

170
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
Kholin, tell him I'll do a good job,
I'll be useful.

171
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,233
I just can't...

172
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,914
You tell him, Katasonych,
I can't go to the rear!

173
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,430
The matter is closed!

174
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,434
All right... Military school,
or a children's home,

175
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,598
it's all the same to me.

176
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,154
Be quiet...

177
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,397
The stove and chimney
will stand forever.

178
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,158
Where is it?
I put it here.

179
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,153
Are you going far?

180
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,233
Yes.

181
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,750
Right.
Everybody's going far nowadays.

182
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,156
But why?
Who knows?

183
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,436
I lost a nail.

184
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,839
Could you help me find it?
You have nothing to do, anyway.

185
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,234
Come in.

186
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,672
The stove and chimney
will never burn down.

187
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,994
Here's a straight nail.

188
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,679
No, it won't do.

189
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,835
Where's your ma? Alive?

190
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,359
A nazi shot my old woman, too.

191
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,438
Where can it be?
I saw it a minute ago.

192
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,758
He was a tall fellow...

193
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,915
He wore glasses.

194
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,437
And had long hair.

195
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,759
- What's your name?
- Ivan.

196
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,316
Pelageya will be back soon...
That's my wife's name.

197
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,076
I'll have the house all ready for her.

198
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,435
Ivan!

199
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,599
Why'd you run away, Vanya?

200
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,679
You think I have nothing better to do
than chasing after you?

201
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,677
I didn't ask you to.

202
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,839
Don't talk back at me. Look at him,
he wants to join the partisans!

203
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,157
Get into the car!
You won't run away again.

204
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,315
Yes, I will.

205
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,476
I said get into the car!

206
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,596
I'll run away
from that military school,

207
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,598
just like I did from the children's
home.

208
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,438
"I ran away from Granny,
And from Granddad, too..."

209
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,589
O Lord,
will this ever end?

210
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,830
Vanya, can'tyou understand, silly,
that war is for grown men?

211
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,588
You promised you won't issue
that order!

212
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,593
Lyakhov and Moroz were killed because
they were big. I can get through.

213
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,318
Besides, I'm all alone.
You know I have no family left.

214
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,476
That's enough, Vanya.

215
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,830
It's been decided.

216
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,758
Nothing is decided!

217
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,592
You're not my dad to decide.

218
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,838
Shut up!

219
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,153
Or I'll spank you.

220
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,918
I'll run away anyway,
if you don't let me go.

221
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,838
I'm my own boss.

222
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,599
Indeed!

223
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,677
You're my pain in the neck.

224
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,235
D'you knowthat there's lice
in Company 5?

225
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,155
The linen isn't disinfected properly.

226
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,430
Do something about it.

227
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,838
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

228
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,315
The situation is out of control.

229
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,155
Yes, sir.

230
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,429
There'll be no time for that
when the offensive begins.

231
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,316
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant!

232
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,998
Thank you, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.

233
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,919
- A letter from home?
- Yes.

234
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,431
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

235
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,238
Greetings!
I've been looking for you.

236
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,438
Carry on. I'll wait here.

237
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,239
You're a commander. You must be
strict with your subordinates.

238
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,149
Butyou try to do everything yourself.

239
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,996
There's a lull now, and we have time.

240
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,749
When the offensive starts,
there'll be the wounded.

241
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,154
I don't know what to do aboutyou.

242
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,077
Since you're a commander,
get the medical service in order.

243
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,989
You've got two days. Then report back
to me.

244
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,516
Yes, Comrade Senior Lieutenant.

245
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,239
Don't worry.
Everything'll be... in order.

246
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,590
What's your name, Lieutenant?

247
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,075
- Masha.
- That's a pretty name.

248
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,996
My name's Leonid.
Lennie for short.

249
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,519
Have you ever had a boyfriend
called Lennie?

250
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,430
- No.
- So I'm the first?

251
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,428
Are you from the Ukraine?

252
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,076
- Why?
- You're beautiful and stubborn.

253
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,760
No, I come from near Moscow.
Peredelkino. Twenty minutes by train.

254
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,670
In Siberia, where I come from,
300 km is considered "near".

255
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,752
Surikov, the painter, used to live in
our town. Ever heard of him?

256
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,830
And in our town, writers used to live.

257
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,994
We once saw Alexei Tolstoy.

258
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,158
And Korney Chukovsky.
He's very tall, with a white head.

259
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,232
They were walking in the woods.

260
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,430
- Were you ever wounded?
- Yes, I was.

261
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,990
Why are we so formal?
Let's be on first name basis.

262
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,679
- I find it hard to so quickly.
- And I don't.

263
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,590
I'll start now, and you start
gradually, okay?

264
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,835
- What is it?
- A cobweb!

265
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,237
So what? Aren'tyou a brave soldier!

266
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,678
Some brave commander!

267
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,440
I'm only afraid of spiders.

268
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,914
Nothing else?

269
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,510
Vassiliev!
Have you seen Captain Kholin?

270
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,080
He went that way with the doctor's
assistant.

271
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,437
Walk the trunk! You said
you're not afraid of anything.

272
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,394
Well, I will.

273
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,508
That's enough.

274
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,118
Jump! I'll catch you.

275
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,519
Got scared?

276
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,428
Then why don'tyou?

277
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,629
No special reason.

278
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,234
So you were frightened?

279
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,431
All right, I forgive you.

280
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,235
I don't need your forgiveness.

281
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,989
You don't?

282
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,076
- Let me help you.
- I'll manage.

283
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,599
She'll manage!

284
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,315
Come here, Masha.

285
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,429
What for?

286
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,997
Come on, Masha, come here.

287
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,589
What for?

288
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,994
Come here, quick!

289
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,474
Hurry!

290
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,589
Now go away...
Go away, Masha.

291
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,239
You hear me, Masha? Go!

292
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,438
Go away quick, Masha...

293
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,438
Let's go and have a look
atyour troops.

294
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,159
There they are, Lyakhov and Moroz.

295
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,233
Go have a smoke.

296
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,429
- Good morning!
- Hello, Katasonych.

297
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,436
Galtsev, give me the defense line map.

298
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,430
Wait for me in your "underground".
I'll be right back.

299
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,274
Comrade Senior Lieutenant,
the gunners gave me a record.

300
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,234
They say you have a gramophone.
Could we listen to it?

301
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,836
- The gramophone's broken.
- I'll fix it.

302
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,758
Thanks, Katasonych.

303
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,317
This place is best, Captain.

304
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,511
But where will we land?
What d'you say, Katasonych?

305
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,158
In those bushes.
It's a safe place.

306
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,430
Only be sure to tell the gunners

307
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,995
to leave us a corridor.

308
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,432
WELCOME

309
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,749
Damn! Couldn'tyou have dug
a deeper one?

310
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,519
D'you know who's sitting there,
on the other bank?

311
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,755
I know.

312
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,396
Then why can'tyou bring them here?
It'll take but an hour.

313
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,430
- Have you got any boats?
- No.

314
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,073
You're lying.

315
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,676
- What for?
- I need them.

316
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,837
You are not even good at lying.

317
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,998
- They're for the landing party.
- That's what I need them for.

318
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,755
Are you and Katasonych planning
a scouting mission?

319
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,918
No, a picnic
with your gramophone.

320
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,838
Will Ivan go again?

321
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,237
Ivan, Ivan...
I'm not an information bureau.

322
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,837
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

323
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,919
You've got a pretty doctor's
assistant.

324
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,838
I'm sending her away.
She can't cope with the job.

325
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,431
Aren'tyou severe, Galtsev!
Have a heart.

326
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,234
War is a man's business.

327
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,237
It's not for girls.

328
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,679
All right, go. I don't need you here.
Some man!

329
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
Excuse me, are you Masha?

330
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,995
Yes.

331
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,589
Don'tyou remember me?

332
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,393
No, I don't.

333
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,991
We took the college entrance exams
together.

334
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,429
Yes... now I do.

335
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,438
I'm so glad I metyou!

336
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,315
Me, too.

337
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,389
I'm glad I saw you.
Where'd you go after the exams?

338
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,871
I looked everywhere...
Now I've found you, Masha.

339
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,235
I'm coming!

340
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,590
I've found you!
We'll meet again, won't we?

341
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,756
We'll meet again, Masha!

342
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,599
We'll meet again!

343
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,998
WELCOME

344
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,998
Captain!
- That's you, Katasonych!

345
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,156
- We are here.
- Good.

346
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,234
Hello, Kholin!
- Hello, Ivan!

347
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,835
Ivan?

348
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,996
- Hello.
- Hello.

349
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,836
Give us a hand, Galtsev.

350
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,995
- Hello, Katasonov!
- Hello, sir!

351
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,237
Give us something interesting,
Galtsev, some magazines.

352
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,678
With lots of pictures.

353
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,599
Come here.

354
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,750
- Here. This one's about scouts.
- I've read it.

355
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,678
- How about this one?
- This one, too.

356
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,235
- And this one?
- This, too.

357
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,074
- You're lying!
- I'm not.

358
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,238
I was stuck at HQ all this time.

359
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,839
I did nothing but read for 3 days.

360
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,234
I gotyou a spring for the gramophone
at HQ.

361
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,918
Thanks, Katasonych.
It's under the bed.

362
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,749
- What's this, so big?
- An art book. Captured material.

363
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,999
- Any pictures in it?
- It's all pictures.

364
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,155
Give it to me.

365
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,438
You should've listened to him sprechen.
Like a real Fritz.

366
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,598
I wanted to make him an interpreter,
now he's in command of a battalion.

367
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,759
Look!
Are these Germans?

368
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,439
Yes, it's an old engraving.

369
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,598
They're Germans, all the same.

370
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,158
Look at this skinny one on a horse.

371
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,995
I saw one just like him
on a motorcycle.

372
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,238
Look, they're killing the people here,
too.

373
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,392
It's just a painting.

374
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,158
No...
I knowthem.

375
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,996
Who is this? A German?

376
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,155
He's either a German doctor,
or writer.

377
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,319
They have no writers.

378
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,234
I sawthem burning books
on the square.

379
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,835
They poured petrol over them
and set them on fire.

380
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,512
There was soot in the air for a week
after that.

381
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,393
This writer lived
about 400 years ago.

382
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,679
Well, then maybe...

383
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,676
If they spot us,
our gunners will keep them down.

384
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,236
We'll leave Ivan a passage
in the swamp.

385
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,238
I retreat last.

386
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,155
Got it?

387
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,998
What's this?

388
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,316
I think I'd better take
one of Galtsev's boats.

389
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,430
- Will you take me along?
- Where to?

390
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,073
To the other bank.

391
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,079
A volunteer, eh?

392
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,312
Can you swim?

393
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,478
Don'tyou worry. I can swim
this river and back 5 times.

394
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,834
What a hero.
Are you trigger-happy, too?

395
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,914
Stop it.

396
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,836
You see? He's so touchy.

397
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,238
No self-control.
How can I take you across?

398
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,439
- Then you don't get a boat.
- We'll commandeer it.

399
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,069
Or I'll reportyou to the Commander,
and you'll bring it to us on your back.

400
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,840
Come on, stop it.
He'll give us a boat.

401
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,314
Am I right?

402
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,917
All right. Let's go have a look.

403
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,315
You stay here and rest up.

404
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,439
Wow! What a knife!

405
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,758
Listen, Galtsev, would you give it
to me?

406
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,392
I would, Vanya, but...

407
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,517
Don't be a miser. Give it to him.

408
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,316
This is a memento.
It was my buddy's. He was killed.

409
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,318
- Let me have it till tonight.
- All right.

410
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,599
Why should I go with you? You're not
taking me across, right?

411
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,839
Come on. I'll take you,
but not today. After the war.

412
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,313
It's okay now.

413
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,315
We'll listen to it after supper.

414
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,756
I'll getyou a knife just like it.

415
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,838
I'll get one tomorrow.

416
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,833
By all means.

417
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,833
Where're his parents?

418
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,758
- Whose?
- Ivan's.

419
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,759
I don't know. They say
his mother and sister were killed.

420
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,440
His dad was a border guard.
I guess he was killed in action.

421
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,429
Really?

422
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,670
He's been through more
than you can imagine.

423
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,158
He was a partisan, too.
He knocked about the world.

424
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,349
What'll become of him?

425
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,680
The colonel or Katasonych will adopt
him when the war's over.

426
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,836
Why them and notyou?

427
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,430
I would,
but the colonel says

428
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,758
I need some upbringing myself.

429
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,591
Katasonych!
He's really good at stealing boats.

430
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,152
He'll never take a bad one.

431
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,430
Tell us, Galtsev,
how many owners have you ripped off?

432
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,392
- Which one?
- Take this one.

433
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,833
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

434
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,998
He should be sent to the rear.
A war is no place for children.

435
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,674
Stop it, will you?

436
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,236
You see, Lieutenant,
if we don't take him across,

437
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,436
he'll go on his own.

438
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,757
All he can think of...

439
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,438
is vengeance.

440
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,760
Don't waste your breath explaining.
They can't see here beyond their nose.

441
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,430
Didn'tyou say
you wanted to adopt him, and now...

442
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,748
What's the matter with you?
Get lost! We'll manage withoutyou.

443
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,234
That's not the way to do it.

444
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,357
- All right, Kholin.
- Don't Kholin me!

445
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,597
The colonel is right.
You do need upbringing.

446
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,917
Watch out, or I'll reportyou
to the commander.

447
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,998
Well... keep cool.

448
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,072
That's the main thing.

449
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,439
Slowly... carefully.

450
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,076
And remember,
we have to get him alive.

451
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,314
Got it?

452
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,790
THERE ARE 8 OF US.
ALL UNDER 19.

453
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,319
IN AN HOUR FROM NOW
THEY'LL SHOOT US.

454
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,114
AVENGE US.

455
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,233
Hurrah!

456
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,909
Surround the building!
Don't let him out!

457
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,596
Hands up! Come out!

458
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,069
So you're hiding!
You can't hide from me!

459
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,232
Are you shaking?

460
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,759
You'll answer for everything!
I'II...

461
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,358
D'you think I've forgotten?

462
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,917
I'll putyou on trial!

463
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,078
I'II... I'II...

464
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,915
Want some tea,
Comrade Captain.

465
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,510
Damn! It was our best boat!

466
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,758
You're lucky to be alive.
Forget the boat.

467
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,437
Faster! Hurry!

468
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,232
Can you hurry up?

469
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,835
Ivan!

470
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,758
Don't be afraid. It'll be over soon.

471
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,833
What is it, Ivan?

472
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,072
I'm not afraid.

473
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,156
I hear you were a partisan.

474
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,068
- Why'd you leave them?
- We were surrounded in the woods.

475
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,999
They sent me out by plane
to a boarding school.

476
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,598
But I ran away.

477
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,316
They're just wasting food there.

478
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,836
Memorizing names of reptiles.

479
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,231
Yeah, that's not for you. You ought
to go to a military school.

480
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,439
Did Kholin make you say so?

481
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,155
Why Kholin?
He's not the only one with brains.

482
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,913
I think so, too.

483
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,317
You've done your fighting.
Rest up, go back to school.

484
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,918
Whoever's of use
doesn't rest up in wartime.

485
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,075
Right. But war isn't for boys.

486
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,156
Not for boys?
Have you been to Trostyanets?

487
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,234
- Where?
- That's a death camp.

488
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,393
Why are you teaching me?

489
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,919
What do you know?
You're all together in it.

490
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,157
Smoking again?
Go on, smoke.

491
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,756
It'll turn you lungs green.

492
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,319
So what?
Nobody can see them.

493
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,317
- I don't wantyou to smoke.
- Okay, I won't.

494
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,998
We'll start out in an hour and a half.
Let's have supper.

495
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,239
- Where's Katasonych?
- He was summoned to HQ.

496
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,590
Why didn't he stop by
to wish me good luck?

497
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,995
He couldn't. It was an emergency.

498
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,835
Why'd they summon him?

499
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,839
They know how badly we need him.
And they summoned him all the same.

500
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,759
A fine friend! He could've stopped by.

501
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,436
Will it be just the two of us?

502
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,439
The three of us. He'll go, too.

503
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,315
Stop grinning. And don't stare at me.

504
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,069
You volunteered, didn'tyou?
Are you frightened now?

505
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,676
No, I'm not. It's sort of unexpected.

506
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,917
Unexpected...
Everything in life is.

507
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,596
- May I come in?
- Yes.

508
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,439
What's up?

509
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,755
We billeted the new men, Lieutenant.

510
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,839
- Where?
- In Companies Two and Three.

511
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,989
- Very well. You may go.
- Yes, sir.

512
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,678
I wouldn't take you,
but it's an emergency.

513
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:33,159
Make up your mind.
No complaints afterwards.

514
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,232
What d'you think I am?

515
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,829
All right.
Who'll you leave in command?

516
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,751
I think, Guschin,
of Company 5.

517
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,155
If they learn you crossed the river

518
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,678
without permission...

519
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,756
we'll be in trouble.

520
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,431
Although it won't take more
than two or three hours.

521
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,156
AVENGE US

522
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,078
Wake up, Ivan!
Do you hear? It's time.

523
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,235
Katasonych didn't even stop by.

524
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,838
I told you he couldn't.

525
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,510
You know how he loves you.
Don'tyou?

526
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,838
I know.
But still, he could have...

527
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,597
Here. Get dressed.

528
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,030
- Need any help?
- No.

529
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,754
Let's jump.

530
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,753
To see if anything rattles.

531
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,599
Dump your matches.

532
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,838
Are you crazy?

533
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,918
Crews, take your positions.

534
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,159
Go chat with the sentry
so he won't notice us... Got it?

535
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,997
And no comments!

536
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,439
Got a light?

537
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,233
Who's that?

538
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,509
It was all so stupid...

539
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,915
They brought the boat here
and had a smoke...

540
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,235
The captain was here.
He was over there...

541
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,075
He started climbing out of the trench.

542
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,430
And then he slid back down.

543
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,995
We didn't even hear a shot.

544
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,348
The captain shook him up:
"Katasonych! Katasonych!"

545
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,996
But he was dead.

546
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,589
The captain said to leave him here...
till morning.

547
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,153
Don't discuss it.
Get the oars.

548
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,512
Who's that?
Who's that, Kholin?

549
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,317
That's our men.
Lyakhov and Moroz.

550
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,591
They went across after you.

551
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,438
There's still time.

552
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,675
Wait here. I'll be right back.

553
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,278
- Come over here. It's dryer here.
- Makes no difference now.

554
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,754
MG-34.

555
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,394
- Are you nervous?
- A bit.

556
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,839
I've become jittery lately.
Can't get used to begging.

557
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,993
They should be buried.

558
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,237
- Who?
- Lyakhov and Moroz.

559
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,679
Sure, we'll do it.

560
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,432
Quiet! Everything's tiptop.
Let's go.

561
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,596
This is the place, guys.

562
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,430
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

563
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,757
- Well, I'll be going.
- I'll go a part of the way with you.

564
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,956
No, you're too big. They'll catch on.

565
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,434
Let me go.

566
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,677
The gully's clayey. You'll leave
footprints. I'll carry you over.

567
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,677
I said I'm going alone.

568
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,235
- See you soon.
- See you.

569
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,751
I'll see you.
Be careful.

570
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,988
If the offensive starts,
meet us in Fyodorovka. Got it?

571
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,154
- See you soon.
- Goodbye, Vanya.

572
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,994
What's up?

573
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,678
I want a smoke.

574
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,599
- Wantyour mommy, too?
- Cut it out.

575
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,590
l, for one, really do want my ma.
Won't it be good, eh?

576
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,235
- They'll notice the boat!
- What if they spot Ivan?

577
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,156
Are you a louse, or plain stupid?

578
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,028
Just stupid.

579
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,597
See a doctor aboutyour nerves
when the war's over.

580
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,155
Damn! It's a clayey gully!

581
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,917
What we need now is a good rain
to wash away all footprints.

582
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,599
I think he made it.

583
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,516
Wait here for me.
I'll go for the boat.

584
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,758
When I come back,
call out to me in German.

585
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,996
- Try it.
- Halt!

586
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,950
If I'm caught, swim back.

587
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,230
You said you could swim this river
and back five times.

588
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,598
What if you're wounded?

589
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,598
Don't worry about me.

590
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,235
Halt!

591
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,668
Quiet!
Damn you! Come here!

592
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,993
Hurry up!

593
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,999
Is that them?

594
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,670
Yes.
Them yesterday, us today.

595
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,829
Climb in.

596
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,430
- Are things quiet on the bank?
- Yes.

597
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,596
See? Nothing to fear.

598
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,154
Where are you going?
Why aren't we going back?

599
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,913
It's the first snow of the year.

600
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,155
Kholin!

601
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,597
What if he hasn't passed yet?
He might still be hiding, waiting.

602
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,439
Jump in the water!

603
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,313
Let's drink to...

604
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,835
May I come in,
Comrade Senior Lieutenant?

605
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,995
Masha!

606
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:27,748
Who were you talking to
on the road the other day?

607
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,919
- Your friend?
- Yes, my friend.

608
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,429
The one... that wore glasses?

609
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,312
He wasn't wearing glasses.

610
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,429
But he was!
He is strange.

611
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,439
No, he isn't.

612
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,235
- What is it, Lieutenant?
- I've come to say goodbye.

613
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,077
I'm transferring her to a hospital.

614
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,153
That's a good idea.

615
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,595
Masha!

616
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,233
How quiet it is, Galtsev.

617
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,599
Isn't it, Masha?

618
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,678
It's so quiet.

619
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,914
The war...

620
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,029
Brothers!

621
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,196
Victory!

622
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,316
IMPERIAL CHANCELLERY

623
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,598
I can take you there.

624
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,837
- Is it far from here?
- No, it's not far.

625
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,233
Come closer.

626
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,838
Can you identify these bodies?

627
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,234
He says he can.

628
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,234
It's Goebbels,
his wife and daughters.

629
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,919
He poisoned his family
with potassium cyanide

630
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,989
and ordered his body to be soaked
with petrol...

631
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,994
and burned.

632
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,436
He can show you the place.

633
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:36,033
At night he murdered his wife,
children, and himself...

634
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,314
I see. Let's go.

635
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:09,077
Won't this be the last war on earth?

636
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,436
You're too nervous, Galtsev.

637
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,998
See a doctor aboutyour nerves.

638
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:22,512
But, Kholin, wait...
You were killed.

639
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,157
And I'm alive.

640
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,156
I must not forget it.

641
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,234
Shot.

642
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,428
Hanged.

643
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,428
Shot.

644
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,914
Hanged.

645
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,439
Shot.

646
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,833
Shot.

647
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,549
Hanged.

648
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,394
Hanged.

649
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,913
Shot.

650
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,679
Hanged.

651
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,514
The End
