1
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,442
And you've come here
directly from Normandy?

2
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:19,352
Ja wohl, ja, ja.

3
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:23,052
And how is the morale
of the combat troops?

4
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:25,756
It's excellent.

5
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:28,266
You mean that?

6
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,205
Ja, ja.

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,429
Please.

8
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:22,712
Ah. That's where the attack

9
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:24,978
against the Fuhrer took place...

10
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:27,680
right in there,
only three weeks ago.

11
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,349
The bomb was placed
under the table.

12
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:33,157
It was in a briefcase.

13
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,827
The generals thought
everyone would be killed,

14
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:39,168
but the Fuhrer was safe,
thank God.

15
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:42,141
General Jodl is waiting.

16
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,408
Please.

17
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:50,318
General Jodl.

18
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,322
Heil Hitler.

19
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,325
Very pleased to see you again.

20
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,022
The Fuhrer wants to see you
immediately.

21
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,032
Be careful
when you shake his hand.

22
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,397
Oh, then he was wounded.

23
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,993
Not badly;
merely a scratch.

24
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,061
Nothing serious.

25
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,163
Nervous?

26
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:04,171
Ja.

27
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:05,503
Quite naturally.

28
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:20,162
...mein Fuhrer.

29
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:30,879
Noch nicht, mein Fuhrer.

30
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,881
Thank you, mein Fuhrer.

31
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:54,408
Thank you, mein Fuhrer.

32
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,252
Ja wohl, mein Fuhrer.

33
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,889
Herr Choltitz, at last.

34
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,423
I am so glad they sent you here.

35
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:24,936
You can't imagine.

36
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,940
As you know, I've been appointed
your successor.

37
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:29,772
Paris is now a fortress city.

38
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,336
I am in full command,
and unfortunately,

39
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,509
it will not be
an easy assignment.

40
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,451
Now, allow me
to introduce to you

41
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,045
some of my staff officers.

42
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,818
Colonel Jay you know already,

43
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,986
General von Boineburg,
Chief of Staff,

44
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,052
and my adjutant...

45
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:46,863
he will serve you well.

46
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,666
Please report to me at
6:"0 tomorrow morning

47
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:52,301
at my headquarters
in the Hotel Meurice.

48
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:55,472
At 7:"0, I want all the officers
for a staff meeting

49
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,246
at which we will study
a plan for the defense

50
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,447
of the city of Paris,
street by street.

51
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,512
Is that clear?

52
00:07:01,556 --> 00:07:02,888
Ja wohl, Herr General.

53
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:05,690
Then I won't disturb you
any longer, gentlemen.

54
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,971
My God.

55
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:23,282
Gentlemen, you have heard
which way the wind's blowing.

56
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,893
Well, what's wrong with you?

57
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,266
Are you drunk?

58
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:36,502
Have you forgotten
how to salute?

59
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,668
Look at this uniform.
It's disgusting.

60
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,077
It looks as if
you've been sleeping in it.

61
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:43,174
Why don't you mind
your own business?

62
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:45,209
It is my business...
I am an officer,

63
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,381
and you are a soldier
in the Wehrmacht.

64
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,118
That's my bad luck, isn't it?

65
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,151
Haven't you heard?
We've lost the war.

66
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,597
Germany's finished. Kaput.

67
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,400
We've had it.

68
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:58,906
Stand up.

69
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:02,905
Papers.

70
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,186
What you need is
a few days in prison.

71
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,630
You're a disgrace to Germany.

72
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,743
Museum is closing.

73
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,924
All right, we are closing.

74
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:08,303
Sorry, monsieur, we're closing.

75
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:09,640
The exit's right there.

76
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,578
Closing time, monsieur.

77
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:13,242
Ja, I'm leaving.

78
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,349
600 rifles to free Paris.

79
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,117
Where are the arms
and ammunition

80
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,561
promised by General De Gaulle?

81
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:24,895
They'll arrive very soon.

82
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,628
Soon? We need them right now.

83
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:29,001
I should get a message
this evening.

84
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,370
London will tell us when

85
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,273
the Allies will arrive in Paris.

86
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,577
If they don't decide
to go around the city.

87
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,877
We'll have to wait if they do.

88
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,317
Tell that to our men.

89
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,089
Bernard Labe could tell them,
and they would listen to him.

90
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:48,828
But he's in prison.

91
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:51,304
We have to free him.

92
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,342
I know only one way.

93
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:03,322
This is the center of Warsaw.

94
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:05,724
It was here
that the Polish terrorists

95
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,660
first fired on German troops.

96
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,824
As a result, the Fuhrer ordered

97
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:11,959
the complete destruction
of the city.

98
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,402
A lesson not only to the Poles,

99
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:14,937
but to the world.

100
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,737
Your husband's alive.

101
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:25,044
In Germany?

102
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:26,817
No. In Paris.

103
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,553
He's to be transferred
to the prison at Fresnes

104
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:32,257
with a large group
of political prisoners.

105
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,424
Fresnes.

106
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,635
That means they'll
send him to Germany.

107
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,644
Yes.

108
00:10:49,724 --> 00:10:51,693
Warsaw no longer exists.

109
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:53,661
And it will never exist again.

110
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:58,426
So perish all enemies
of the Reich.

111
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:00,768
Enough of these horror pictures!

112
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,035
Keep quiet, I want to watch.

113
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:04,340
If you like it so much,
why don't you

114
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:05,345
go to Germany?

115
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,404
I didn't do anything, I swear.

116
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,539
I'm telling you, it's a mistake.

117
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:10,315
Day after tomorrow
at Place des Vosges.

118
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,567
That's how we're planning
to set them free.

119
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,479
That's premature.

120
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,414
An uprising can't succeed
without support from the Allies.

121
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,851
In that case,
they'd better hurry.

122
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:57,321
In the last four years,

123
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:59,450
I've changed my address
ten times.

124
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:00,824
I've changed my name.

125
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:03,387
Today, our men are like me.

126
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,297
Impatient to come
out in the open.

127
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,428
Impatience was never
a good argument for anything.

128
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,005
German morale is low.

129
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,404
We ought to strike right now.

130
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,966
De Gaulle is in London.

131
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,607
If he were in Paris, he'd
see things differently.

132
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,777
For the Germans, the
Resistance is an enigma.

133
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,685
Soldiers without
uniforms or training.

134
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,918
They're convinced that
we've got them outnumbered.

135
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,050
That's to our advantage.

136
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:23,823
Anyway you measure,
the decision can come

137
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:25,990
only from the National
Council of the Resistance.

138
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,192
Yes, we know that.

139
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,861
So call a meeting,

140
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,838
but I'm sure they
will agree with me.

141
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:33,273
Think what happened to Warsaw.

142
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,335
If you start too soon,
you'll find

143
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,142
you've only liberated ruins.

144
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:42,120
My name is Eller.

145
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:43,986
I was just parachuted
from London.

146
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,523
Thanks, that's a good job.

147
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,800
Please, Sister, would you
go get the last messages

148
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,401
while I'm decoding this one?

149
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,269
The Allied high command
has decided to bypass Paris.

150
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:06,334
They're going
straight to the Rhine.

151
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,312
This is terrible.

152
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:16,291
As General De Gaulle's
military delegate,

153
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:20,286
you are ordered to avoid
an uprising at all costs.

154
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,824
But how can I possibly control

155
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:23,633
all the other groups
of resistance?

156
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:25,903
What can I say to them?

157
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,432
Just be patient, relax,

158
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:29,946
and one of these days
the Allies will show up?

159
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,247
We must convince
the Allies to help us.

160
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,379
Amicol, do you think
with a bit of pressure

161
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:38,256
from intelligence service
they might change their plans?

162
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:42,253
My friend, all I'm supposed
to do is to get information.

163
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,130
And I do, believe me.

164
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:47,764
The decision
is part of strategy.

165
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:49,398
They must save
all of their fuel

166
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:51,000
to push their way to the Rhine

167
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:53,240
and before Hitler
can regroup his troops.

168
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,909
There's only one solution.

169
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,714
I have to go to London.

170
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:59,553
Then in your absence I will do
everything that is in my power

171
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,855
to avoid an uprising.

172
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:04,659
You can't prevent it
without any help.

173
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,932
Bernard Labe.

174
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,495
Only he can help us now.

175
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,257
Would you please do me a favor

176
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,567
and get me a cup of coffee
before I collapse?

177
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm afraid you'll have
to collapse.

178
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,401
With the new commander,
no more coffee breaks.

179
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:42,036
It's all work and no play.

180
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,479
Austerity till victory.

181
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:44,914
Just on the front.

182
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,179
Let's not exaggerate.

183
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,619
Reporting for duty,
Herr General.

184
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:12,783
You are seven minutes late
this morning.

185
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:15,056
I'm sorry, Herr General.

186
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,033
Issue a proclamation

187
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,935
to the population
of the city of Paris.

188
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:25,032
Print it immediately.

189
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:32,982
Should any civilians shoot
at a single German soldier,

190
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:36,652
the entire block
in which the shot was fired

191
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,525
will be razed to the ground.

192
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,666
Do you have such a good memory

193
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,763
you don't need to write down
what I'm saying?

194
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:47,934
Yes, Herr General.
I mean, no...

195
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:49,534
I mean, no, Herr General.

196
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:52,580
Number two...

197
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:56,280
issue an order to disarm
the entire city.

198
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:58,916
Number three...

199
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,722
I want a plan
for the destruction

200
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,492
of important strategic points

201
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:06,162
in case we're forced
to fight in the city.

202
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:10,039
To ensure our defense.

203
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,304
Number four...

204
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:15,749
a plan to destroy
the entire city

205
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:19,083
in case we're forced to withdraw
and retreat to the Rhine.

206
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,113
Destroy the entire city?

207
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:22,250
Ja.

208
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,228
Any objections?

209
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,527
But is Paris of any
strategic importance?

210
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,534
Is there any point
in turning the city

211
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:30,161
into a heap of rubble?

212
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:31,968
Cable Berlin...
ask for the arrival date

213
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,308
of Captain von Ebernach
and his demolition squad.

214
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,879
Also the arrival date of Karl.

215
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,283
"Also arrival date of Karl. "

216
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,448
What is his last name, sir?

217
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,152
Hmm?

218
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,184
Oh, ja.

219
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:49,063
Here, look at this.

220
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,102
That's Karl there.

221
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,400
No, not this one.

222
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,408
Here, look.

223
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,173
A giant mortar.

224
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:00,009
A beautiful toy.

225
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,781
When old Karl spits out a shell,
a city block is erased.

226
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,015
You see that man?

227
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,822
Gives you an idea of the scale.

228
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,827
Ja?

229
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,193
You have lovely children,
Herr General.

230
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,754
Ja.

231
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,668
When you're finished,
report back to me.

232
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,002
Ja wohl, Herr General.

233
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,671
Tomorrow morning, the Gestapo

234
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,510
will transfer Bernard
to Fresnes.

235
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,814
He'll only stay there
two or three days.

236
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:29,687
Oh, if I'd only known.

237
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:32,956
Do you realize it was
the morning the Gestapo

238
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,362
arrested Bernard
that I found out

239
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:36,992
he worked for the Resistance?

240
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:40,838
He never knew I was
working for them, too.

241
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,176
Each of us kept it a secret.

242
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:49,009
You might as well
tell me the truth.

243
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:51,080
Were his responsibilities
important?

244
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:54,094
His district
covered all of Paris.

245
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:55,356
More than that,

246
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,957
he had respect and admiration
of the entire Resistance.

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,865
Now there's talk

248
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,771
of insurrection,
and your husband

249
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,675
is one of the few men who
can influence Colonel Rol,

250
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,938
persuade him to wait.

251
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,845
Bernard is very important to us.

252
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,410
Then... you've got a plan?

253
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:13,582
Can you get Bernard out?

254
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:16,185
I have to go away
on a mission.

255
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:19,095
I'm afraid you have
to do it without me.

256
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,598
How? Tell me.

257
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:28,202
Go see Nordling,
the Consul General of Sweden.

258
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,611
He's already negotiated
for several prisoners.

259
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:34,108
The cost is high, 20 Germans
for every Frenchman,

260
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:37,089
but it's our only hope.

261
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:40,685
Nordling.

262
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,062
I'll go see him.

263
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,829
Thank you.

264
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:46,360
Good-bye.

265
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:48,066
See you after your dance class.

266
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,401
Pardon.

267
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:12,730
And where are you going, Madame?

268
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:14,561
I must see Consul Nordling
right away, sir.

269
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:15,726
No, that's impossible.
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,133
- It's very urgent.
- Can you come back?

271
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,536
It's important.
I've got to see him.

272
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:19,631
Have you an appointment,
Madame?

273
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:20,733
It's a matter
of life and death.

274
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,073
No, no.

275
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:23,340
Well, I'm very sorry,
but I must ask...

276
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,347
It'll only take a few minutes.

277
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:25,610
Now, I promise.
Please let me see him.

278
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,674
What's going on here?

279
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,209
Herr Consul Nordling,
my name is...

280
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,585
She's trying
to force her way in.

281
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,884
What can I do for you, Madame?

282
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:33,689
Oh, Mr. Nordling, I'm
terribly sorry to disturb you,

283
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,959
but my husband is
in the prison at Fresnes.

284
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:40,936
Madame, there are 2,980
political prisoners in Fresnes.

285
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:42,462
Now, if you'll excuse me.

286
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:45,033
Oh, but Bernard is a
very important leader

287
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:46,271
in the Resistance.

288
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:47,439
Bernard Labe.

289
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:49,006
His work is important.

290
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,783
Bernard.

291
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:52,948
Bernard Labe.

292
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,117
Races horses,

293
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,060
has the lovely place
in the country?

294
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:58,894
Yes.

295
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,295
I've been there.

296
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:04,101
Madame Labe,
you-you don't remember me.

297
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,132
I came with a large company.

298
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:07,837
You were very charming.

299
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:10,644
I... I particularly
remember the lunch.

300
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,741
There was a marvelous mousse.

301
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:16,289
Mr. Nordling, you're speaking
of another century.

302
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:17,951
Oh, please, what can I do?

303
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:20,189
Well, the Germans, so far,
have refused

304
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:22,094
to exchange political prisoners.

305
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:24,034
However,
there's a new commander,

306
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:26,095
and it's... just possible.

307
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,334
Oh, will you see him?

308
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,501
Can you see him?

309
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:29,772
I...

310
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:31,109
I will give anything.

311
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,240
Money, anything.

312
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:34,443
Trout.

313
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,578
What?

314
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,614
It was a mousse of trout.

315
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,593
That day at the lunch.

316
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,619
- Oh.
- Come on.

317
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:14,864
Where are they being sent?

318
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:16,070
Across the Rhine.

319
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,237
Buchenwald.

320
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,271
Buchenwald.

321
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:24,277
Oh, Buchenwald,
oh, Buchenwald.

322
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:31,667
They're sending
the French prisoners

323
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,260
to Germany, and we stay here.

324
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:36,240
Why the easy way
when they can make things hard?

325
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,919
Papers, please.

326
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:21,103
These are the plans

327
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,075
for destroying
the most important factories.

328
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,509
Herr General,

329
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:26,173
the Swedish
Consul Nordling is here.

330
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,705
He wishes to see you
immediately.

331
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,047
No, I can't now.

332
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:31,213
I gave specific orders
that my conference

333
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:33,224
with Captain Ebernach
was not to be interrupted.

334
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:35,022
Consul Nordling insists
it's very urgent.

335
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:36,221
He'll have to wait.

336
00:24:36,262 --> 00:24:37,389
Ja wohl, Herr General.

337
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:38,989
Are these the plans
of the factories?

338
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:40,968
Ja wohl. Over 200,
Herr General.

339
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,838
The bridges. 48.

340
00:24:46,877 --> 00:24:49,848
The electrical works.

341
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:51,851
The reservoirs.

342
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:54,513
The gas works.

343
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:58,356
In five minutes, the entire
city's totally destroyed.

344
00:24:58,394 --> 00:25:02,264
How long will it take your men
to place the explosives?

345
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,293
48 hours.

346
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:07,637
Good.

347
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:12,814
Herr General,

348
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,317
are we also supposed

349
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:15,980
to destroy
the historical monuments?

350
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,147
The Notre Dame?

351
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,521
The Louvre?

352
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,957
Everything.

353
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:22,224
But not before
you receive my personal order.

354
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,891
Ja wohl,
Herr General.

355
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,061
This is the greatest
assignment

356
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:28,196
the Fuhrer has ever
entrusted to me.

357
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:29,569
To destroy an entire city.

358
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,006
Well...

359
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,532
we've had enough practice,
haven't we?

360
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:36,039
Ja wohl, Herr General,
but never on such a scale.

361
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,553
You're right.

362
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:40,113
With Paris, the eyes
of the world will be upon us.

363
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:41,249
But don't forget, huh?

364
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,056
You are not
to begin any demolition

365
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:45,155
without receiving written orders
from me.

366
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,360
I understand, Herr General.

367
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:49,836
That will be all.

368
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:01,784
A beautiful city, Herr General.

369
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,086
Ja.

370
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,720
I suppose so.

371
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:09,824
But we are soldiers,
not tourists.

372
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,768
Send in the Swedish Consul.

373
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,965
Ja wohl, Herr General.

374
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,747
- Herr Consul.
- General.

375
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:21,249
What can I do for you?

376
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:30,487
General...

377
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,261
it is my desire

378
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,326
that the prisoners
camps be conducted

379
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,338
according
to the Geneva Convention.

380
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:42,411
In order that we may
avoid such massacres

381
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,814
as have already
occurred in Cannes

382
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:47,047
and Fresnes.

383
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,488
That's a political concern,
not military.

384
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,826
What happened?

385
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:58,097
I have a signature.

386
00:26:58,137 --> 00:26:59,195
You do?

387
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:00,228
I can't believe it.

388
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:01,331
We have a chance.

389
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:02,467
Hotel Majestic.

390
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,102
- Oh...
- The prisoners...

391
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:05,113
Oh, that's marvelous.

392
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:06,809
...may be turned over
to the Red Cross

393
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,513
if I can get a countersignature
from the military governor.

394
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:53,784
51 is the first bus.

395
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:59,256
47 is the second bus.

396
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:06,399
49 is the third bus.

397
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:12,305
64 is the fourth bus.

398
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:46,627
Very well.

399
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:48,895
We shall hold
the remaining prisoners

400
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:52,098
until the Red Cross arrives
to take them into custody.

401
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,231
Thank you, Major.

402
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:56,843
Excuse me, I-I wonder,

403
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:58,642
do you happen to have
a bit of brandy?

404
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,650
I'm feeling... rather faint.

405
00:29:00,684 --> 00:29:02,083
It must be the heat.

406
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,054
I'm sorry, Consul General.

407
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,886
I do not drink spirits.

408
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,654
But here's some water.

409
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:10,721
Water's far better
for your system

410
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,734
than fermented grain.

411
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:17,173
I couldn't agree with you more.

412
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:19,574
Major...

413
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:22,582
I believe that some prisoners
are already

414
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:24,346
at the railroad station

415
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,647
preparing to leave.

416
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:26,984
Ja.

417
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:29,321
2,45", to be exact.

418
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,917
Isn't that a list?

419
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,772
There must be some way
to stop them.

420
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:46,339
They are no longer
under my jurisdiction.

421
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,614
Once we deposit
them at the station,

422
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,018
they belong to the SS.

423
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,351
We don't have trains

424
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,588
to repatriate
our own wounded home.

425
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:56,894
And these SS pigs find them
to transport prisoners.

426
00:29:56,933 --> 00:30:00,132
There must be some way
of releasing these prisoners.

427
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:03,998
From the SS?

428
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,243
Well...

429
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:10,717
I suppose you can always try.

430
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:39,758
I have my orders,

431
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,852
which I have conveyed
to your group leader.

432
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:46,300
I advise you to listen to him.

433
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:48,600
Very attentively.

434
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,075
To avoid any misunderstandings.

435
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,078
Is that clear?

436
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:57,083
Uh, group leader.

437
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:58,517
Group leader!

438
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,595
Tell your men what
they can expect.

439
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,629
They say that
we'll all be executed

440
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:14,368
if anybody escapes.

441
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:17,038
So there's no use
trying to run away.

442
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,209
They'll catch you,
and shoot the rest of us.

443
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:38,068
Papers?

444
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,773
I want to see the Kommandant.

445
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:42,112
The Kommandant?

446
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,112
Let him pass.

447
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,603
Herr Kommandant.

448
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,940
I have an order from the...

449
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:26,173
Inside.

450
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:39,393
Inside!

451
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:43,064
Inside!

452
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:44,369
For God's sake, will you stop

453
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:46,240
waving your damn papers
in front of my nose?

454
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:48,245
I don't care in the least
what's stamped on it.

455
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,474
Herr Kommandant...

456
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:51,143
I have orders
to send these pigs to Germany.

457
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,270
This has been signed...

458
00:33:10,313 --> 00:33:13,977
Bernard!

459
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:15,816
Bernard!

460
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:18,881
I've got the papers!
You are free!

461
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,826
Bernard!

462
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:26,594
Bernard!

463
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:30,267
Bernard, I've got the papers!

464
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,107
You are free!

465
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:46,495
Bernard!

466
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:49,436
Bernard!

467
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,383
- By general...
- General who?!

468
00:33:58,417 --> 00:33:59,406
General this, General that,

469
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,749
General here, General there...

470
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,687
General damn! Since they
tried to kill the Fuhrer,

471
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:04,088
I don't care about
generals anymore.

472
00:34:04,124 --> 00:34:05,091
They're all traitors.

473
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,388
What are you doing here?

474
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,294
How did you get past
the roadblock?

475
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:09,424
What is this?

476
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,627
What's going on?

477
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,864
Why can't you keep any order?

478
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:14,099
Who is that woman?!

479
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:16,641
Herr Kommandant,
she is under my protection.

480
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:17,905
- Swedish?
- No, but...

481
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,173
Then get her out of there!

482
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,575
Bernard!

483
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:48,453
Bernard!

484
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,049
Bernard, you are free!

485
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,500
No! No!

486
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,769
Bernard!

487
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,471
Bernard, no!

488
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:05,947
No! No! No!

489
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:10,844
No, Bernard, no!

490
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,599
No!

491
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:25,770
Bernard!

492
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:50,492
The Germans have disarmed
the police stations

493
00:36:50,536 --> 00:36:51,936
at Saint-Denis and Duniere.

494
00:36:51,972 --> 00:36:54,806
As a protest, the entire
police force has gone off duty,

495
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:56,105
but the Commissioner of Police

496
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:57,544
ordered them back
to their posts.

497
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,706
Will they obey the order?

498
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,739
No. No.

499
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:03,219
I can't give any
orders to the police,

500
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,383
but our operation would
certainly be much easier...

501
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:08,827
if the police
were to stay on strike.

502
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:10,023
Yes?

503
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,225
It fits in with our plans.

504
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,858
The Resistance units
of the police

505
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:13,960
will decide tonight

506
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:15,698
when they meet
with the other sections.

507
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:17,536
I'll be at the meeting.

508
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:19,042
I'll talk to them.

509
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:22,207
The leader of the
student Resistance

510
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:25,687
was contacted by an
agent called Serge.

511
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:28,350
He said he could get them
rifles and ammunition.

512
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:30,018
How was the student contacted?

513
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,254
By one of his friends.

514
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:33,423
Says he works
for intelligence service.

515
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:35,195
A favorite trick of the Gestapo.

516
00:37:35,234 --> 00:37:36,599
It's out of the question.

517
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:38,764
All arms and ammunition
must come through us.

518
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:40,273
Yes, but when?

519
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,399
Very soon.

520
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:43,434
A little patience.

521
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,044
What did Rol say?

522
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,206
We have to cancel it.

523
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:08,374
It's too risky.

524
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,384
But that's crazy.

525
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:10,646
I know Captain Serge.

526
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:11,745
He can be trusted.

527
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:12,880
No. It's no.

528
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:14,686
Oh, but I swear,
he told me that...

529
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,194
- It's no use, Paul.
- He promised!

530
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,662
It's no use, Paul.

531
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:20,427
Colonel Rol says no.

532
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,264
But when are we going
to fight back?

533
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,031
Very soon, very soon.

534
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:25,471
Just be patient.

535
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,591
You come for the ammunition?

536
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,295
I'm Captain Serge.

537
00:38:44,402 --> 00:38:46,200
We were sent here by Francois.

538
00:38:46,238 --> 00:38:47,399
Good work.

539
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,429
You're the first ones.

540
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:49,773
It's all right; it's Serge.

541
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,874
Cigarette?

542
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,438
Thanks.

543
00:38:57,755 --> 00:38:59,748
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

544
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:00,952
Cigarette?

545
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:02,154
Oh, merci.

546
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:03,253
Thanks.

547
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,799
Oh, there they are.

548
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,234
They're friends of ours,
from the same street.

549
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,240
I'm Captain Serge.

550
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,748
I'm Diane, Catholic Youth Party.

551
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,877
Young Communists.

552
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:23,414
Here's our driver.

553
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:24,483
- Hello.
- Hello.

554
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:25,551
Listen,

555
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:27,119
it's ridiculous,
all of us meeting

556
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,462
in the middle of the street.

557
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,761
A perfect way to get caught.

558
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:30,828
Come on, let's go.

559
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,168
The ammunition is in a garage.

560
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,265
Why don't you follow me?

561
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:35,071
Yes, all right.

562
00:39:36,412 --> 00:39:38,108
Hey, what
are you waiting here for?

563
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,479
Hurry, let's go.

564
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:22,202
Have you got the merchandise?

565
00:40:22,246 --> 00:40:25,307
I've got a big surprise
for you, Konrad.

566
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,181
There are at least "0.

567
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,687
How's that?

568
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,553
Bravo.

569
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:36,891
Don't move.

570
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,300
All of you stay in the truck.

571
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:41,306
Hands up!

572
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,568
Nobody move!

573
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,577
All right, boys, game's over.

574
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,202
Get into position.

575
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:04,034
The rest of you, back.

576
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:05,165
Get them out.

577
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:09,440
Out!

578
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:16,554
Aah! No! No! No!

579
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,226
No, no, no!

580
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,104
Not me, not me!

581
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,072
Aah!

582
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,666
Come on, get out!

583
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,322
They killed all of them?

584
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,562
All of them,
and no trace of this Serge.

585
00:42:09,603 --> 00:42:12,870
Apparently a Frenchman
working for the Gestapo.

586
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,935
I tried to warn them.

587
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:18,073
The poor kids.

588
00:42:20,385 --> 00:42:22,752
And the strike?

589
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:24,018
How about the police?

590
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:25,525
It's done.

591
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,652
They've voted.

592
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:29,358
Good. And now
it's up to us.

593
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:39,771
Next time, it will be
more than posters.

594
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,130
Over there.

595
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,239
Tear them down.

596
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,375
All of them.

597
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:18,727
Damn French swine.

598
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:21,469
Any news of Chaban?

599
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:24,001
The only thing I know is
that he's left London.

600
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:25,674
Will the Allies head for Paris?

601
00:43:25,715 --> 00:43:27,013
I know as much as you do.

602
00:43:29,788 --> 00:43:32,087
Pierreflot, you are late.

603
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:33,386
I am sorry.

604
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,455
They are all over town.

605
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:40,531
"Paris fights back. "

606
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,164
Hmm, Colonel Rol's been busy,
hasn't he?

607
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:44,401
Mm-hmm.

608
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:46,377
Apparently,
the liberation has begun.

609
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:48,938
We should have acted first.

610
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:54,411
Look here, you represent
General de Gaulle in Paris.

611
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:55,786
What do we do now?

612
00:43:55,826 --> 00:43:57,817
We don't have very much choice,
do we?

613
00:43:57,862 --> 00:43:59,955
You sent for me?

614
00:43:59,997 --> 00:44:01,488
What is the latest report?

615
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:03,661
We have received word
from Chabon.

616
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:05,228
He has returned to Paris.

617
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:06,705
Chabon's returned.

618
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,072
I must see him before curfew.

619
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,103
We'll call a meeting of the
National Committee tomorrow.

620
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,812
We must move against
the Germans before Rol.

621
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:23,256
We must take the
prefecture of police.

622
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:24,961
It's the nerve center of Paris.

623
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:26,526
Between now and tomorrow?

624
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,697
The list!

625
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:28,865
Claire.

626
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:30,637
Yes?

627
00:44:30,676 --> 00:44:32,508
Mademoiselle, please
take this list of names

628
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:33,672
to the mailbox.

629
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,262
The section heads
will have all night

630
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:45,524
to notify their agents.

631
00:44:48,134 --> 00:44:49,534
Yes.

632
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,786
May I help you, mademoiselle?

633
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,591
Oh, la, la.

634
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,223
Don't bother.

635
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:12,704
But curfew is starting
in a few minutes.

636
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,035
Permit me.

637
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:18,170
Ah.

638
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:20,842
It's not, it's not
working so well.

639
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:23,045
I think it's broken.

640
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,223
I'm sorry.

641
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:26,815
I have to go home now.

642
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:30,421
In that case, permit me
to take you in my car.

643
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:35,030
Why, it's very nice of you
to help me.

644
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:41,306
Oh, you simply have no idea
how helpful you really are.

645
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:10,914
Where were you?

646
00:46:10,954 --> 00:46:12,182
What are you doing in uniform?

647
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:14,816
Well, I saw a circular saying
that we should go back to work.

648
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:15,985
But that's a lie.

649
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:17,518
The National
Liberation Committee

650
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:19,360
announced they'd dismiss
any policeman

651
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:20,525
who puts on his uniform.

652
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:21,863
Look at us,
we're not in uniform.

653
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:24,030
The orders are to go
to the prefecture

654
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,064
But that means they're
trying to divide us.

655
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:27,201
Let them try.

656
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,332
Well, you mustn't come here,
Monsieur Labe.

657
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,603
Things might get dangerous.

658
00:47:58,678 --> 00:47:59,702
That's just the point.

659
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,715
I thought that you might
need a chaplain.

660
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,474
Yves Bayet, all your
instructions arrived last night.

661
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:20,568
Everything's working out
as we planned.

662
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:21,235
That's fine. Perfect.

663
00:48:21,278 --> 00:48:22,302
Can I talk to you a minute?

664
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:22,870
Yes, I'll see you later.

665
00:48:22,914 --> 00:48:23,903
Say, do you think that...

666
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:36,989
Quiet.

667
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:38,866
Quiet!

668
00:48:38,904 --> 00:48:45,403
In the name of the Republic,
and of General De Gaulle,

669
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:48,746
I'm taking possession
of the prefecture of police.

670
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:42,228
I never gave orders
to take the prefecture.

671
00:49:42,265 --> 00:49:44,757
Looks like somebody else
gave the order for you.

672
00:49:44,801 --> 00:49:47,430
Tell our men to go into
action immediately.

673
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:50,067
I'll see what's happening.

674
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,818
Mama!
Take a look down there.

675
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,327
Oh, thank God it's all over.

676
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:10,259
Jean-Pierre Guillom,
do you take Lillian Ceverat

677
00:50:10,304 --> 00:50:11,738
for your lawful wedded wife?

678
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:12,763
I do.

679
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:14,800
Lillian Ceverat, do you
take Jean-Pierre Guillom

680
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:16,142
for your lawful wedded husband?

681
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,511
I do.

682
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,245
Then it is with great pleasure
that I pro...

683
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:24,052
Take off that sash, monsieur.

684
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,923
You're no longer mayor.

685
00:50:36,008 --> 00:50:38,443
Then we can't be married?

686
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:41,505
The ceremony will continue.

687
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:46,456
Congratulations
and best wishes to you both.

688
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,134
Monsieur Luizet, in compliance

689
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:58,766
with instructions
from General De Gaulle,

690
00:50:58,808 --> 00:51:00,333
I'm handing over the prefecture.

691
00:51:00,378 --> 00:51:02,244
- Bayet.
- Yes?

692
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,112
It's Joliot Curie.

693
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,449
You mean... ah.

694
00:51:06,487 --> 00:51:10,185
Ah, excuse me, uh...
Joliot Curie.

695
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:11,192
Bayet.

696
00:51:11,227 --> 00:51:12,194
Delighted.

697
00:51:12,228 --> 00:51:13,490
Take me to the wine cellar,
please.

698
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:14,497
- The wine?
- That's right.

699
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:15,998
Go and show the professor
the wine cellar.

700
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,003
It's across the courtyard.

701
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:18,004
Thank you, monsieur.

702
00:51:18,038 --> 00:51:19,028
Don't mention it.

703
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,455
Empty all the wine bottles
in the cellar.

704
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,187
Careful.
Easy with the suitcases.

705
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:36,219
They've got acid in them.

706
00:51:41,237 --> 00:51:44,401
We'll make beautiful
Molotov cocktails.

707
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,876
Even the chateau margot
and the champagne?

708
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,147
Yes, except the magnums,
they're too big.

709
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,341
The gasoline,
the gasoline, hurry.

710
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:32,241
Attention.

711
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:34,544
Attention.

712
00:52:34,582 --> 00:52:37,643
This is Colonel Rol talking.

713
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:39,245
I have a message.

714
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,418
As chief of the F.F.I.
for the region of Paris,

715
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,556
I want to congratulate you all.

716
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:50,060
Thanks to you, the Germans
are on the defensive.

717
00:52:50,105 --> 00:52:51,697
That's just the beginning.

718
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:55,940
But there are far
too many of you here.

719
00:52:55,981 --> 00:53:00,511
All of you, except "00, go back
to your district headquarters.

720
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:03,491
We will give you further
instructions in due time.

721
00:53:03,525 --> 00:53:08,760
The essential thing is,
the Nazis see us all over Paris.

722
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,597
All right, go on.

723
00:53:18,146 --> 00:53:20,012
I see Colonel Rol's found us.

724
00:53:20,049 --> 00:53:22,484
Well, what counts is that
we made the first move.

725
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,888
From now on, we are all
in the same boat.

726
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:28,625
We are off to a good start.

727
00:53:28,662 --> 00:53:30,687
The courthouses are occupied,
at least 80%.

728
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:31,959
That's good work.

729
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,196
Now I'm going to check up
on the police stations.

730
00:53:34,237 --> 00:53:37,571
Colonel Rol, I have ten men,
what shall we do?

731
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:41,008
Take a position
on the riverbank.

732
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:42,912
But I have no rifles.

733
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:45,144
Well, go back to bed.

734
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:10,688
Don't shoot.

735
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:12,783
Wait till he gets closer.

736
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:50,173
Quick, the ammunition.

737
00:54:50,214 --> 00:54:52,581
The rifles.

738
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:55,421
One for me.

739
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:56,821
Come on.

740
00:54:57,892 --> 00:54:59,086
Here.

741
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,632
Quick.

742
00:55:06,038 --> 00:55:07,267
Go on.

743
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:11,640
Well, what do we do with them?

744
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,272
Put them in the cellar.

745
00:55:13,315 --> 00:55:14,681
I'm very sorry.

746
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:17,482
They didn't tell me we weren't
allowed to drive across Paris.

747
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:33,254
You French, I'll kill you all!

748
00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:34,593
I'll kill every one of you!

749
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:39,162
French pigs.

750
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:06,100
Take me to the Hotel Meurice!

751
00:57:06,143 --> 00:57:08,135
Hotel Meurice!

752
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:26,531
What's wrong?

753
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,371
What's wrong? What's wrong?

754
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:30,105
What are you waiting for?!

755
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:34,481
My men are being burnt alive!

756
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:36,885
Come.

757
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:38,890
Have three tanks lined up

758
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:41,359
in front of the prefecture
right away.

759
00:57:42,698 --> 00:57:44,690
And keep firing at it

760
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:46,795
until every one
of them surrenders.

761
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:51,902
What's more, alert the Luftwaffe
at Le Bourget.

762
00:57:51,978 --> 00:57:54,140
We'll need their support.

763
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:58,585
That will be all.

764
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:47,592
No. Stay here.

765
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:48,593
No, let me go.

766
00:58:48,627 --> 00:58:49,754
Listen to me.
Come back.

767
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:51,264
Monique!

768
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:00,263
Watch out!

769
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:01,790
They're going to shoot at us.

770
01:00:08,844 --> 01:00:10,243
Here come the tanks.

771
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:11,406
Tanks?

772
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:12,915
- Here come the tanks.
- Where are they?

773
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:14,177
On Quai St. Michel.

774
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:15,345
They're encircling us.

775
01:00:15,387 --> 01:00:17,252
They sent a couple of shots
through the windows.

776
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:18,257
Three men were killed.

777
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:19,781
Quick! Did you get
the code through?

778
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:21,226
- Yes.
- Hurry, Mademoiselle.

779
01:00:21,262 --> 01:00:22,960
- Get down.
- Watch out!

780
01:00:55,014 --> 01:00:56,983
Open up!
It's the Red Cross!

781
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:58,314
Open the door!

782
01:00:58,351 --> 01:01:00,445
It's the Red Cross!

783
01:01:17,145 --> 01:01:19,114
Damn it!

784
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,083
Just when I was going
to get my phone call.

785
01:01:47,155 --> 01:01:48,622
The German...

786
01:01:48,657 --> 01:01:50,956
Hello. German tanks are firing
on the prefecture.

787
01:01:52,196 --> 01:01:53,720
Hello.

788
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,868
Hello? We must have
reinforcements.

789
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:01,877
Send every man who's available.

790
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:03,606
At Ile de...

791
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:05,114
Hello? Hello? Hello?

792
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:06,674
At Ile de la Cite.

793
01:02:06,718 --> 01:02:07,946
You must...

794
01:02:07,986 --> 01:02:09,648
you must attack the enemy
from behind.

795
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:10,952
Hello?

796
01:02:11,024 --> 01:02:12,116
Hello?

797
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:15,086
Hello? Can you hear me?

798
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,099
Hello? H... Hello?
What did you...

799
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,761
Hello. What?

800
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,332
There's another call.

801
01:02:21,372 --> 01:02:22,498
I'm sorry. Quickly.

802
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:23,667
He's wounded.

803
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:26,302
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Badly.

804
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:28,440
It's the Mayor of Paris,
but he's wounded.

805
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:30,212
- Hello, hello.
- He's been hit.

806
01:02:30,252 --> 01:02:32,621
Germans attacking.
Send reinforcements.

807
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:34,215
Hello? Yes.

808
01:02:34,259 --> 01:02:35,989
Oh, quickly, quickly.

809
01:02:36,028 --> 01:02:37,997
A doctor before he dies!

810
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:56,184
Diane.

811
01:02:56,223 --> 01:02:57,350
What are you doing?

812
01:02:57,392 --> 01:02:58,654
Don't you see he's dead?

813
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,978
What do you expect us
to fight with?

814
01:03:14,016 --> 01:03:15,142
Pen knives?

815
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:16,880
We've called all over town
for ammunition.

816
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,582
They want us to give
up the prefecture.

817
01:03:18,623 --> 01:03:19,590
But that's impossible.

818
01:03:19,624 --> 01:03:20,591
Physically and morally.

819
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:21,593
Absolutely impossible.

820
01:03:21,627 --> 01:03:23,117
Now that we're here,
we're staying.

821
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:30,095
Quick, hurry up!

822
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:54,458
So, that's the thanks I get

823
01:04:54,496 --> 01:04:56,988
for freeing those
political prisoners.

824
01:04:57,033 --> 01:05:00,061
And now that rebel at the
prefecture wants a cease-fire.

825
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,197
Ha!

826
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:02,434
Never.

827
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:04,706
We exterminate all of them!

828
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:08,579
I promise you that by tomorrow

829
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:10,175
they'll be no prefecture,

830
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:11,780
no cease-fire, no palace.

831
01:05:11,823 --> 01:05:13,518
We leave that
to the Luftwaffe.

832
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:17,019
And if a bomb should miss?

833
01:05:17,064 --> 01:05:20,228
A few bombs always miss,
but others will hit the target.

834
01:05:20,268 --> 01:05:22,260
It's the law of averages.

835
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,334
A bomb that misses...

836
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:31,844
could hit...

837
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:35,049
Notre Dame.

838
01:05:35,156 --> 01:05:38,650
Ste. Chapelle.

839
01:05:38,695 --> 01:05:40,857
That's a thousand years
of history

840
01:05:40,898 --> 01:05:43,026
turned to dust.

841
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:46,240
You're not the first one
to tell me that.

842
01:05:46,274 --> 01:05:47,867
Yesterday morning,

843
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,935
the Mayor of Paris was here,
Monsieur Titinger.

844
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:51,173
Titinger?

845
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:52,705
And he said the same thing.

846
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,183
But what can I do?

847
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:56,187
I am a soldier,
and I must obey the orders

848
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:58,884
I was given by the Fuhrer.

849
01:05:58,925 --> 01:06:01,121
General...

850
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:05,796
your enemy...

851
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:08,236
is the Allied Army,

852
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:11,298
not the people of Paris.

853
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:16,206
What you really care about
is the defense of the city.

854
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,719
Hmm? Am I right?

855
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:22,818
Arrange for a cease-fire,

856
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,730
and you'll have time
to prepare that defense.

857
01:06:30,337 --> 01:06:31,805
Report from the prefecture.

858
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,306
Our men are losing ground.

859
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:34,775
How's it going in Noilly?

860
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:36,870
Heavier resistance
than we expected.

861
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:41,045
Order the Luftwaffe into action
over Paris.

862
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:43,487
Herr General, the Allies
have air superiority.

863
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:44,854
If we try daylight bombing,

864
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:47,292
we'll lose the last planes
that we've got left.

865
01:06:47,327 --> 01:06:49,423
Then attack tomorrow morning
before dawn.

866
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:52,493
The divisions from Denmark...
have we had any word of them?

867
01:06:52,537 --> 01:06:54,972
No, and I'm doubtful
that we'll ever get them.

868
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,443
Then...

869
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:05,683
You, you will accept
a cease-fire?

870
01:07:08,726 --> 01:07:11,925
I must hold the bridges,
and time is running out.

871
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,301
With a cease-fire,
I could gain time.

872
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:23,081
But you do the negotiating.

873
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:25,880
I don't want to be involved
with it, understand?

874
01:07:25,919 --> 01:07:27,785
Of course.

875
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:31,886
But if those people
dare to shoot

876
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:33,829
at even one of my men...!

877
01:07:33,865 --> 01:07:35,560
Don't worry, General.

878
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,562
History will be grateful
to you...

879
01:07:40,607 --> 01:07:44,545
for having saved a...

880
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:47,378
very beautiful city.

881
01:07:51,556 --> 01:07:53,185
Hello.

882
01:07:53,226 --> 01:07:54,523
Susan?

883
01:07:54,561 --> 01:07:56,894
Yes.

884
01:07:58,233 --> 01:08:00,896
I'm fine.

885
01:08:02,673 --> 01:08:05,165
I wanted to hear your voice.

886
01:08:07,613 --> 01:08:10,310
Yes.

887
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,151
The children, how are they?

888
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:17,318
Give them a kiss.

889
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,987
Of course I do.

890
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:20,827
Don't worry, I will.

891
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:21,992
Yes.

892
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:23,160
No, no, don't worry.

893
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:25,695
No, please.

894
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:32,343
I don't even have any bullets...

895
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,011
We won! They're pulling out!

896
01:08:34,053 --> 01:08:35,145
They're running away!

897
01:08:38,558 --> 01:08:40,151
No, don't, please.

898
01:08:40,194 --> 01:08:41,389
You mustn't.

899
01:08:54,147 --> 01:08:55,547
Cease fire.

900
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:58,077
A cease-fire
has just been concluded

901
01:08:58,122 --> 01:09:00,557
with the German Commander
of Paris.

902
01:09:00,592 --> 01:09:03,153
The National Committee
of Resistance

903
01:09:03,196 --> 01:09:05,995
issued an appeal
to all citizens of the Republic

904
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:08,662
not to engage
in any further reprisals

905
01:09:08,703 --> 01:09:11,332
or demonstrations of any kind.

906
01:09:11,373 --> 01:09:14,002
In exchange,
the German occupation forces

907
01:09:14,044 --> 01:09:15,842
agree not to attack
public buildings

908
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,179
now in the hands
of the Resistance.

909
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:21,813
Furthermore, they agree to treat
all French prisoners

910
01:09:21,855 --> 01:09:25,349
according to the laws of war
in the Geneva Convention.

911
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:28,193
Cease fire!

912
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:31,668
A cease-fire
has just been concluded

913
01:09:31,704 --> 01:09:35,072
with the German Commander
of Paris.

914
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:40,078
How do you like that?

915
01:09:40,115 --> 01:09:41,104
What's going on?

916
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,210
Those double-crossers
used my name

917
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:44,651
to order a cease-fire.

918
01:09:44,688 --> 01:09:46,748
Now that the Germans
are running,

919
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:48,225
we're not going to quit.

920
01:09:48,293 --> 01:09:51,492
I'm afraid we'll have to quit...
no ammunition.

921
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:53,865
We'll find some.

922
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:56,098
Thanks to the cease-fire...

923
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,435
Thanks to the cease-fire

924
01:09:57,473 --> 01:09:59,237
we have already won,
first of all,

925
01:09:59,309 --> 01:10:01,303
official recognition
of this committee

926
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:02,837
and of our forces in Paris.

927
01:10:02,883 --> 01:10:04,145
Furthermore,

928
01:10:04,185 --> 01:10:06,518
we can avoid certain defeat,
a crucial point.

929
01:10:06,555 --> 01:10:08,547
You know perfectly well
the prefecture

930
01:10:08,591 --> 01:10:10,753
would have been taken
in an hour at most.

931
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:12,125
- And you know why, too.
- Yes.

932
01:10:12,162 --> 01:10:13,425
Where was the ammunition?

933
01:10:13,464 --> 01:10:16,025
Our delegation has demanded
time and time again

934
01:10:16,068 --> 01:10:19,436
that the Allies give us arms
and launch a spearhead on Paris.

935
01:10:19,472 --> 01:10:21,168
We haven't received an answer.

936
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,138
I met General Patton myself.

937
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:27,047
He didn't say it
in so many words,

938
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:28,779
but it's clear that the Allies

939
01:10:28,819 --> 01:10:31,220
intend to capture Paris
by encirclement.

940
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:33,557
It is up to us
to remain where we are.

941
01:10:33,595 --> 01:10:34,824
There's no choice.

942
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,559
We must keep
the gentleman's agreement

943
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,589
we made with Choltitz.

944
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:38,601
Choltitz.

945
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:39,603
With Choltitz, gentleman.

946
01:10:39,637 --> 01:10:40,626
That's right. Choltitz.

947
01:10:43,008 --> 01:10:44,738
I'm only concerned with saving

948
01:10:44,777 --> 01:10:47,941
the lives of our men and
avoiding unnecessary killing.

949
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:51,784
For us, it's only a matter
of deferring all combat

950
01:10:51,821 --> 01:10:53,881
until such time
as the balance of forces

951
01:10:53,924 --> 01:10:55,721
swings in favor
of the Resistance.

952
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:56,954
I see.

953
01:10:56,995 --> 01:10:59,988
We sit on our behinds
until the arrival of the Allies.

954
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:01,227
That is treachery!

955
01:11:02,369 --> 01:11:03,894
It is you who are traitors!

956
01:11:03,938 --> 01:11:06,534
It is impossible
to discuss anything seriously

957
01:11:06,576 --> 01:11:09,546
under these conditions.
I'm leaving!

958
01:11:23,266 --> 01:11:25,258
I propose we put it to a vote.

959
01:11:34,281 --> 01:11:36,250
Raise your hands
if you're voting

960
01:11:36,284 --> 01:11:37,777
in favor of a cease-fire.

961
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:49,236
All those who oppose it?

962
01:11:53,645 --> 01:11:58,049
The cease-fire
is rejected by one vote.

963
01:11:58,084 --> 01:11:59,882
I will abide by the decision

964
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,754
of the majority,
but for tactical reasons,

965
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:06,193
I must request that our decision
to resume fighting

966
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:08,826
not be announced
before tomorrow, ":00.

967
01:12:13,942 --> 01:12:15,136
Halt!

968
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:17,906
We must put on
a show for them

969
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:19,245
so act with authority.

970
01:12:19,282 --> 01:12:20,250
Leave it to me.

971
01:12:20,284 --> 01:12:21,410
Get out!

972
01:12:21,452 --> 01:12:22,613
Hands up!

973
01:12:27,495 --> 01:12:29,964
We are representatives
of the Resistance.

974
01:12:29,998 --> 01:12:31,556
A cease-fire was concluded

975
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,762
with the General
in command of Paris

976
01:12:33,803 --> 01:12:36,796
through the intervention
of the consul of Sweden.

977
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,868
We are checking to make
sure that it's respected.

978
01:12:39,912 --> 01:12:41,073
We shall see.

979
01:12:41,114 --> 01:12:42,309
Major, a briefcase.

980
01:12:47,223 --> 01:12:48,281
Terrorists.

981
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:49,952
I'm sorry, this is serious.

982
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:51,291
Very serious.

983
01:12:51,328 --> 01:12:55,460
You're obliged to respect
the conditions of the truce.

984
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:57,299
You have to liberate us.

985
01:12:57,337 --> 01:12:58,828
Go on, get in.

986
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:02,241
Quickly, get in.

987
01:13:02,278 --> 01:13:04,008
They could be telling the truth,

988
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:06,073
but I can't afford
any more trouble.

989
01:13:06,117 --> 01:13:07,516
I think I'd better check up.

990
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:09,453
I'm turning this over
to the Gestapo.

991
01:13:09,488 --> 01:13:12,253
I'll take the women in my car
and you the men in yours.

992
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:14,263
Yes, sir.

993
01:13:14,297 --> 01:13:16,289
Go on! Both of you.

994
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:25,274
I decided the only thing
to do was to execute them,

995
01:13:25,346 --> 01:13:28,316
but then I thought you might
want to speak to them.

996
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:35,486
Gentlemen.

997
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:36,858
I suppose you know

998
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:39,160
the Swedish Consul,
Herr Nordling.

999
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:41,429
Thanks to his efforts,
we arranged a truce

1000
01:13:41,468 --> 01:13:44,735
which, up to now, has cost the
lives of 200 German soldiers.

1001
01:13:44,775 --> 01:13:45,764
As a representative

1002
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:48,302
of General De Gaulle's
provisional government,

1003
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:49,508
I protest!

1004
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:52,485
Against our arrest
in the midst of the cease-fire.

1005
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,421
We are just
contacting our people

1006
01:13:54,456 --> 01:13:56,321
to make sure they respected it.

1007
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:58,554
In your car, my guards
discovered a proclamation

1008
01:13:58,594 --> 01:14:01,189
that was designed to provoke
the city of Paris to revolt.

1009
01:14:01,232 --> 01:14:04,066
I don't see how you maintain
you're respecting the cease-fire

1010
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:05,934
and then make
vicious attacks on our men

1011
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:07,371
right in front of our faces!

1012
01:14:07,407 --> 01:14:10,070
I'm a member of the French
Government in Exile

1013
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:13,310
and I won't permit you to
question my word of honor!

1014
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:17,978
The circular in the car

1015
01:14:18,023 --> 01:14:20,823
was a proclamation
that had been revoked.

1016
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:23,626
In that case, why did your men
shoot at our soldiers?

1017
01:14:23,665 --> 01:14:25,634
You command an army of regulars.

1018
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:28,137
When you give an order,
your men obey it.

1019
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:31,039
The Resistance is
an alliance of many movements,

1020
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:32,440
and I don't
control them all.

1021
01:14:32,476 --> 01:14:33,876
The Communists, for example?

1022
01:14:33,912 --> 01:14:38,681
Our ranks include both
Communists and anti-Communists.

1023
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,817
Now we're all battling
against a common enemy.

1024
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:46,920
You can make among yourselves
all the politics that you want!

1025
01:14:46,965 --> 01:14:49,562
Only you must not shoot
at my soldiers!

1026
01:14:49,604 --> 01:14:52,438
If you would like
to finish these incidents,

1027
01:14:52,474 --> 01:14:54,500
stop sending out your patrols.

1028
01:15:08,664 --> 01:15:11,293
Herr Consul...

1029
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:13,097
since these men
were taken prisoner

1030
01:15:13,136 --> 01:15:15,105
after the cease-fire
went into effect,

1031
01:15:15,139 --> 01:15:16,903
I place them in your custody.

1032
01:15:16,942 --> 01:15:18,170
Thank you, General.

1033
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,236
Are you an officer?

1034
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,877
Officer in the Reserves.

1035
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,352
Well, then...

1036
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:36,027
Get these men out of here
before I change my mind.

1037
01:15:56,997 --> 01:15:58,157
Careful.

1038
01:16:33,984 --> 01:16:35,144
Well...

1039
01:16:35,186 --> 01:16:38,157
now we're going underground

1040
01:16:38,191 --> 01:16:40,524
and I mean literally.

1041
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,833
We've taken most of
the police stations

1042
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:47,028
and post offices.

1043
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,697
Good, but remember,
no matter what

1044
01:16:48,738 --> 01:16:50,502
as long as the Germans
are in Paris,

1045
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:53,136
the orders are
to keep fighting.

1046
01:16:53,178 --> 01:16:54,372
It's right through here.

1047
01:16:56,749 --> 01:16:57,844
We'd better hurry.

1048
01:16:57,887 --> 01:16:59,377
He'll be calling any minute.

1049
01:16:59,423 --> 01:17:00,515
Hey, Maurice.

1050
01:17:00,591 --> 01:17:03,459
Here, German sweaters,
underwear.

1051
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:04,622
Ah! It's about time.

1052
01:17:04,663 --> 01:17:05,789
We're freezing here.

1053
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:07,026
Take one.

1054
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:13,166
Here, give this to Jean.

1055
01:17:16,714 --> 01:17:17,908
It's time.

1056
01:17:33,872 --> 01:17:36,671
Ja. Ja.

1057
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:38,507
Everything's in order.

1058
01:17:38,546 --> 01:17:39,535
Heil Hitler!

1059
01:17:40,749 --> 01:17:41,909
What's going on?

1060
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:42,975
The German watchman.

1061
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:45,318
Every day for the last two years
he's called

1062
01:17:45,355 --> 01:17:48,052
to make sure everything's
all right in the sewers.

1063
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:30,718
Hello? Hello?

1064
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:34,159
This is the main sewer station,
Place de la Concorde.

1065
01:18:34,195 --> 01:18:36,289
A Nazi tank is still patrolling.

1066
01:18:36,331 --> 01:18:37,821
Nothing else to report.

1067
01:18:37,866 --> 01:18:39,391
Everything's all right.

1068
01:18:44,776 --> 01:18:46,642
Somehow, we've got
to make contact

1069
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,011
with the Allied Command.

1070
01:18:48,048 --> 01:18:49,879
I thought you
were sending Veret.

1071
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,009
He was killed.

1072
01:18:51,052 --> 01:18:54,216
He didn't even reach the front.

1073
01:18:54,256 --> 01:18:57,421
That makes six men we have lost.

1074
01:18:57,461 --> 01:19:00,090
And so we'll have
to send out a seventh.

1075
01:19:00,132 --> 01:19:01,997
Maurice, you know the region?

1076
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:03,502
I- I'm from Marseilles.

1077
01:19:03,569 --> 01:19:04,764
You know Normandy?

1078
01:19:04,805 --> 01:19:06,637
I've been there on vacation,

1079
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,610
but I can't say I know it
very well.

1080
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:10,510
That leaves it up to you,
I guess.

1081
01:19:10,547 --> 01:19:11,879
Will you do it?

1082
01:19:13,885 --> 01:19:15,217
Of course.

1083
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:18,854
Dr. Monod has a car,
a safe-conduct, everything.

1084
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:20,656
He told me that
you might get through

1085
01:19:20,695 --> 01:19:22,459
by pretending
you're going to inspect

1086
01:19:22,497 --> 01:19:23,759
the hospitals in Normandy.

1087
01:19:25,768 --> 01:19:27,327
Sounds good.

1088
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:28,531
Good.

1089
01:19:28,572 --> 01:19:31,168
but after you've
contacted the Americans...

1090
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,404
If I contact them.

1091
01:19:32,445 --> 01:19:33,640
Good morning.

1092
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,079
These are your papers.

1093
01:19:35,115 --> 01:19:36,378
You're assisting me.

1094
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:38,182
I'll let you drive the car.

1095
01:19:39,557 --> 01:19:42,891
Uh, tell me,
know any medical terms?

1096
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:43,987
No, nothing much.

1097
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,258
Well, I'll have an intern

1098
01:19:45,298 --> 01:19:47,290
at the hospital at Versailles
come along with us.

1099
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:48,825
It will help.

1100
01:19:58,684 --> 01:19:59,810
A good motor.

1101
01:19:59,852 --> 01:20:03,312
Ah. Old Marcie gave me
a real gasoline.

1102
01:20:09,495 --> 01:20:10,556
- For you.
- Yes, who is it?

1103
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:12,067
It's a man.
I can't hear him.

1104
01:20:12,102 --> 01:20:13,228
Hello. Yes? Yes?

1105
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:15,501
It's Mantes! Yes!

1106
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,509
The Americans are in Mantes!

1107
01:20:17,543 --> 01:20:19,569
The Americans are in Mantes!

1108
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,410
Listen.

1109
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,351
Y- You can hear tanks.

1110
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,445
Listen!

1111
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:29,123
Here, listen!

1112
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:32,422
I can't believe it!

1113
01:20:41,243 --> 01:20:42,802
Hospital attendant.

1114
01:20:42,846 --> 01:20:45,008
There, you see?

1115
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,108
Und he?

1116
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:47,345
He's been assigned to us.

1117
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:48,819
Why, yes, he's my assistant.

1118
01:20:48,855 --> 01:20:50,790
We're going to visit
one of my patients

1119
01:20:50,824 --> 01:20:52,724
at the sanitarium
in Neufchateau.

1120
01:20:52,759 --> 01:20:55,320
The doctor and his assistant
have an emergency call,

1121
01:20:55,364 --> 01:20:57,833
and they'd like to go
to Neufchateau by car.

1122
01:20:57,868 --> 01:20:59,733
Hey, what's going on
over there?

1123
01:20:59,769 --> 01:21:00,930
Turn everybody back.

1124
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:02,804
The curfew begins in "0 minutes.

1125
01:21:02,841 --> 01:21:04,274
Go on!

1126
01:21:04,309 --> 01:21:06,608
I'll have every one of you shot!

1127
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:25,339
Halt!

1128
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,173
Turn around!

1129
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:39,522
What are you doing here today,
Monsieur Cocteau?

1130
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,326
Good evening, monsieur.

1131
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:42,626
It's nearly curfew.

1132
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:45,294
Matter of fact,
we've come to see you.

1133
01:21:45,336 --> 01:21:47,068
Oh, fine.
It's a pleasure.

1134
01:21:47,107 --> 01:21:48,233
Is it all right?

1135
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:49,334
Of course. Certainly.

1136
01:21:49,377 --> 01:21:50,537
I'll open the gate.

1137
01:21:50,579 --> 01:21:51,638
Follow me.

1138
01:21:51,747 --> 01:21:53,978
So, that's your real name?

1139
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:23,482
I hope you gentlemen
will be comfortable.

1140
01:22:23,526 --> 01:22:24,994
Good night.

1141
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:26,257
Good night.

1142
01:22:26,297 --> 01:22:28,630
Thank you, monsieur.

1143
01:22:38,982 --> 01:22:40,779
According to the farm boy,

1144
01:22:40,817 --> 01:22:43,309
it's only 11 kilometers
to the front.

1145
01:22:43,354 --> 01:22:45,585
He's willing to show me the way.

1146
01:22:45,624 --> 01:22:47,456
It's safer to go at night.

1147
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:50,591
You mean you trust a farm boy
you never saw before?

1148
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,934
Why, you won't even make
two kilometers in this rain,

1149
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:55,303
and with those shoes.

1150
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,366
What if you meet
a German patrol?

1151
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:59,311
You can't say
you are on your way

1152
01:22:59,346 --> 01:23:01,281
to give a sick cow
some medicine.

1153
01:23:04,553 --> 01:23:05,612
Listen, my friend.

1154
01:23:05,655 --> 01:23:07,886
To me, it's madness
to ask the Allies

1155
01:23:07,925 --> 01:23:10,417
to parachute arms
into a city like Paris.

1156
01:23:10,462 --> 01:23:12,054
You realize... guns dropping

1157
01:23:12,097 --> 01:23:14,191
all over the roofs,
in the streets?

1158
01:23:14,233 --> 01:23:17,636
You know very well they might
fall into anybody's hands.

1159
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:21,734
But after all, it's my mission.

1160
01:23:21,777 --> 01:23:23,771
Well, instead
of asking for weapons,

1161
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:26,308
say they should push
immediately for Paris.

1162
01:23:31,393 --> 01:23:32,884
Impossible. My orders are...

1163
01:23:32,929 --> 01:23:35,592
Well, then,
if that doesn't work,

1164
01:23:35,632 --> 01:23:39,400
you must try and speak
to Leclerc, all alone.

1165
01:23:39,438 --> 01:23:41,532
Why, returning to Paris...

1166
01:23:41,575 --> 01:23:44,477
it's been his dream
for four years.

1167
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,561
Ooh.

1168
01:23:57,598 --> 01:24:01,934
I shouldn't have eaten
those pig's feet.

1169
01:24:01,971 --> 01:24:04,440
To think I'm a doctor.

1170
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:07,774
They always
give me heartburn.

1171
01:24:14,922 --> 01:24:16,788
You'll never make it,
believe me.

1172
01:24:16,825 --> 01:24:18,589
The woods are crawling with SS.

1173
01:24:18,628 --> 01:24:21,257
The roads are all blocked
for ten kilometers.

1174
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:26,630
What do we do now?

1175
01:24:26,672 --> 01:24:27,972
The morning's wasted,

1176
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:30,571
and we still can't
get around the Germans.

1177
01:24:30,613 --> 01:24:32,104
Come on.

1178
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:39,850
Major Georges.

1179
01:24:39,893 --> 01:24:41,383
Of course, that's it. Why not?

1180
01:24:41,428 --> 01:24:44,991
He's the head of the Resistance
in Corbeil.

1181
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:48,128
Hurry.

1182
01:24:52,811 --> 01:24:54,973
No, no, give me the
ration ticket tomorrow.

1183
01:24:55,014 --> 01:24:56,141
Thank you very much.

1184
01:24:56,183 --> 01:24:57,707
Here, Pierre.
Take your bread.

1185
01:24:57,751 --> 01:24:59,381
There. Good-bye.

1186
01:24:59,423 --> 01:25:01,483
Good-bye.
Thank you very much.

1187
01:25:04,163 --> 01:25:06,098
The Americans are
at edge of the woods.

1188
01:25:06,132 --> 01:25:07,429
Then it's all right.

1189
01:25:07,467 --> 01:25:08,594
Good.

1190
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:09,967
Well, I'll leave you here.

1191
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,906
I must return to the hospital
as soon as possible.

1192
01:25:16,614 --> 01:25:17,774
And the Germans?

1193
01:25:17,816 --> 01:25:18,840
The Germans?

1194
01:25:18,884 --> 01:25:20,318
At the other end of the village.

1195
01:25:20,353 --> 01:25:21,547
They've occupied a farm

1196
01:25:21,587 --> 01:25:23,613
with guns behind
each stack of hay.

1197
01:25:23,657 --> 01:25:25,683
Believe me, with them
you mustn't use tricks.

1198
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,695
You must show force.
It's the only method.

1199
01:25:27,763 --> 01:25:29,230
Let's go.

1200
01:25:37,545 --> 01:25:38,569
Is he the one?

1201
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:39,637
Yes, it's him.

1202
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,207
He wants to go over
to see the Americans.

1203
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:44,482
Well, we can try.

1204
01:25:44,521 --> 01:25:46,717
Seymour!

1205
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:48,554
Watch the store.

1206
01:25:50,296 --> 01:25:52,731
I use them because
of their uniforms.

1207
01:25:52,832 --> 01:25:54,994
The Germans have respect
for uniforms.

1208
01:25:55,036 --> 01:25:56,334
Conditioned reflex.

1209
01:25:56,371 --> 01:25:57,861
I'll let you know
when I get back.

1210
01:25:57,906 --> 01:25:59,374
I'm going, too.
You need support.

1211
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:00,398
Go on.

1212
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:48,680
Albert...

1213
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:51,184
Yes or no?

1214
01:26:51,219 --> 01:26:52,949
Watch out for the machine guns.

1215
01:26:52,988 --> 01:26:54,149
Ready?

1216
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:55,680
Ready.

1217
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:56,757
Stop!

1218
01:27:58,633 --> 01:28:00,261
This is a good spot.

1219
01:28:00,302 --> 01:28:01,531
All right.

1220
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:06,408
Hey, go on.

1221
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,450
The Americans
are across the field.

1222
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:14,582
Well, good luck.

1223
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:15,649
Thanks.

1224
01:28:15,692 --> 01:28:16,887
Get going.

1225
01:28:46,838 --> 01:28:48,363
Let him go.

1226
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:51,639
If we shoot him, we'll give away
our position to the Americans.

1227
01:29:09,704 --> 01:29:12,105
Hey...

1228
01:29:12,141 --> 01:29:15,441
where did you come from?

1229
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:18,984
I come from Paris

1230
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:22,387
with a message
for General Eisenhower.

1231
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25,318
Here's the new call to arms.

1232
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,727
Fine.

1233
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:02,080
Where did you find
that tin hat?

1234
01:30:02,115 --> 01:30:03,446
I stole it from
a German sergeant

1235
01:30:03,483 --> 01:30:04,610
while he was taking a nap.

1236
01:30:04,652 --> 01:30:06,119
You should've picked
one that fit you.

1237
01:30:06,221 --> 01:30:08,122
Hey, why don't you bring
a pillow along, too?

1238
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:10,884
Here are the bullets.

1239
01:30:10,927 --> 01:30:12,862
Take them over to Colette.

1240
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:16,665
I stole them from the bakery.

1241
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:17,829
They had plenty.

1242
01:30:31,191 --> 01:30:32,818
We start out of Deburre,

1243
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:34,987
fly over Paris,
back to the airfield,

1244
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,498
then start over again.

1245
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:39,330
Herr General Field Marshal.

1246
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:42,430
Please leave us alone
for a minute.

1247
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:50,848
It is quite clear that
you are no longer able

1248
01:30:50,885 --> 01:30:52,480
to keep order in the city.

1249
01:30:52,523 --> 01:30:53,615
And we've also learned

1250
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:55,490
that you've negotiated
with the terrorists.

1251
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:56,721
Herr General Field Marshal...

1252
01:30:56,762 --> 01:31:00,825
It's not your business
to meddle in politics.

1253
01:31:00,868 --> 01:31:02,769
Why did you make the panzers
leave their post

1254
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:04,135
at the prefecture?

1255
01:31:04,172 --> 01:31:05,435
I thought it more efficient

1256
01:31:05,474 --> 01:31:06,839
to attack with the Luftwaffe.

1257
01:31:06,876 --> 01:31:09,004
Then please explain why
you didn't use the Luftwaffe?

1258
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:11,311
Because of the superior
air strength of the Allies.

1259
01:31:11,349 --> 01:31:13,682
I discussed it with Major Hegel
of the Luftwaffe...

1260
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:14,914
I warn you,

1261
01:31:14,954 --> 01:31:17,446
you must restore order
by any method, however drastic.

1262
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:19,892
Ja wohl,
Herr General Field Marshal.

1263
01:31:19,928 --> 01:31:21,624
If you don't follow my orders

1264
01:31:21,664 --> 01:31:23,564
you know what
the consequences are.

1265
01:31:23,599 --> 01:31:26,629
Ja wohl,
Herr General Field Marshal.

1266
01:31:26,673 --> 01:31:29,165
Heil Hitler.

1267
01:31:29,243 --> 01:31:30,437
Hell Hitler.

1268
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:48,199
General Field Marshall Model.

1269
01:31:56,516 --> 01:31:59,645
Draw up a plan
for the bombing of Paris.

1270
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:20,679
Okay. Major Gallois.

1271
01:32:20,717 --> 01:32:24,382
I've been sent by Colonel Rol,

1272
01:32:24,423 --> 01:32:27,393
the head of the
French Resistance for Paris,

1273
01:32:27,427 --> 01:32:31,333
to tell you that we have
seized half of the city.

1274
01:32:31,368 --> 01:32:34,202
And now we want you to...

1275
01:32:34,305 --> 01:32:36,706
You want what? Hmm?

1276
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:44,016
We want you to help us.

1277
01:32:46,656 --> 01:32:49,217
The situation is this:

1278
01:32:49,259 --> 01:32:52,821
we hold all
the official buildings.

1279
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:56,734
After one day's truce,
fighting has started again,

1280
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:58,898
but we are short
of arms and ammunition.

1281
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:02,003
The Germans will find out
sooner or later,

1282
01:33:02,046 --> 01:33:05,779
and when they do,
their reaction may be terrible.

1283
01:33:05,818 --> 01:33:09,186
Especially if they receive
reinforcements

1284
01:33:09,223 --> 01:33:11,692
from the east, as we are told.

1285
01:33:14,096 --> 01:33:16,031
They may destroy Paris.

1286
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:21,839
So we ask you
to send us one unit

1287
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:25,778
to liberate the city
immediately.

1288
01:33:25,813 --> 01:33:27,782
You're a soldier,
I'm a soldier,

1289
01:33:27,816 --> 01:33:29,808
I'll give you
a soldier's answer.

1290
01:33:29,852 --> 01:33:33,221
First, we're not in the business
of liberating cities,

1291
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:34,418
not even capitals.

1292
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:37,191
Our business is to destroy
the German army.

1293
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:39,722
We can end this war
in three months

1294
01:33:39,767 --> 01:33:41,463
if we keep moving fast.

1295
01:33:41,503 --> 01:33:44,234
Second, Major Gallois,
don't you think

1296
01:33:44,274 --> 01:33:46,971
that I would like
to help you people?

1297
01:33:47,011 --> 01:33:49,879
Can't you see what my
position is right now?

1298
01:33:52,385 --> 01:33:54,047
Third, we can't change plans

1299
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,181
that have been
scheduled for months.

1300
01:33:56,224 --> 01:33:57,954
Final victory depends upon it.

1301
01:33:57,993 --> 01:33:59,551
Our plans don't include

1302
01:33:59,595 --> 01:34:02,064
feeding four million
Parisians, hmm?

1303
01:34:02,098 --> 01:34:05,560
I'm sorry, Major, it's no dice.

1304
01:34:10,246 --> 01:34:13,648
I'll report our conversation
to my superiors in Paris.

1305
01:34:15,887 --> 01:34:17,378
Sit down.

1306
01:34:19,626 --> 01:34:22,687
Orderly!

1307
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,392
Yes, sir?

1308
01:34:24,433 --> 01:34:26,766
Open up a bottle of champagne.

1309
01:34:26,803 --> 01:34:28,464
- Champagne.
- Yes, sir.

1310
01:34:35,648 --> 01:34:37,050
Are you tired?

1311
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:39,715
No, sir.

1312
01:34:39,756 --> 01:34:44,161
May I ask you a...
a personal favor?

1313
01:34:44,196 --> 01:34:45,527
What is it?

1314
01:34:45,564 --> 01:34:48,261
I want to talk to a French
officer, General Leclerc.

1315
01:34:48,334 --> 01:34:51,737
Mmm. Leclerc?

1316
01:34:51,773 --> 01:34:53,935
That impatient lion.

1317
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,372
You mind traveling all night?

1318
01:34:58,416 --> 01:34:59,440
Of course not.

1319
01:34:59,484 --> 01:35:00,577
Good.

1320
01:35:04,224 --> 01:35:05,954
Here's one for the road.

1321
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:11,892
Akerns?

1322
01:35:11,935 --> 01:35:13,062
Yes, sir.

1323
01:35:13,104 --> 01:35:14,662
Get a jeep and a driver

1324
01:35:14,706 --> 01:35:17,836
for this man and see
that he gets to Laval.

1325
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:20,609
He needs to see General Leclerc.

1326
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:21,945
Thank you, sir.

1327
01:35:26,589 --> 01:35:28,558
You got a long trip
ahead of you.

1328
01:35:28,592 --> 01:35:31,494
Half the brass in Europe
is at Laval, you know?

1329
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:34,159
Hello? Hello?

1330
01:35:34,201 --> 01:35:37,433
General Bradley, please.

1331
01:35:40,409 --> 01:35:41,674
Good trip, huh?

1332
01:35:48,255 --> 01:35:51,749
Brad?

1333
01:35:51,794 --> 01:35:54,958
What the hell's happening
in Paris?

1334
01:36:22,172 --> 01:36:24,539
Colonel Lebel, Major Gallois.

1335
01:36:26,745 --> 01:36:28,941
Colonel Lebel,
General de Gaulle's liaison,

1336
01:36:28,982 --> 01:36:30,473
assigned to General Bradley.

1337
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:35,887
General Patton telephoned
to say you were en route.

1338
01:36:35,925 --> 01:36:36,915
Who?

1339
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,291
General Patton.

1340
01:36:38,328 --> 01:36:39,694
You saw him at the front.

1341
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:41,062
That was General Patton?

1342
01:36:41,099 --> 01:36:42,158
Yes.

1343
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:44,261
General Leclerc is not here

1344
01:36:44,304 --> 01:36:45,863
but, um, I...

1345
01:36:45,907 --> 01:36:49,276
I told the Americans
you were coming,

1346
01:36:49,312 --> 01:36:51,713
and they are very anxious
to see you.

1347
01:36:51,749 --> 01:36:53,216
In fact, General Sibert

1348
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,551
will interrupt a staff meeting
to hear your report.

1349
01:36:56,589 --> 01:36:59,457
This is our last chance
to convince the Allies

1350
01:36:59,493 --> 01:37:01,985
that they must go on
straight to Paris.

1351
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,293
It's up to you now.

1352
01:37:05,034 --> 01:37:06,468
Yes.

1353
01:37:31,173 --> 01:37:34,576
We're listening, Major.

1354
01:37:34,612 --> 01:37:39,141
The Resistance
and the people of Paris

1355
01:37:39,184 --> 01:37:42,781
now control most of the city.

1356
01:37:45,894 --> 01:37:50,164
We wanted to welcome you
to a liberated Paris.

1357
01:37:50,202 --> 01:37:54,800
But we cannot hold out
indefinitely.

1358
01:37:57,312 --> 01:37:59,611
We need your help.

1359
01:37:59,649 --> 01:38:02,016
The Germans have
no organized units

1360
01:38:02,052 --> 01:38:04,681
between your advanced
lines and Paris.

1361
01:38:04,722 --> 01:38:10,629
From the military point of view,
it would be a-a mistake,

1362
01:38:10,664 --> 01:38:12,360
almost a crime,

1363
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:18,831
if you didn't take advantage
of such a favorable situation.

1364
01:38:18,876 --> 01:38:24,374
It... it is only a question
of time, gentlemen.

1365
01:38:24,418 --> 01:38:27,183
The Germans will counterattack,

1366
01:38:27,221 --> 01:38:31,284
and they have precise orders
to destroy Paris.

1367
01:38:31,328 --> 01:38:34,993
Hundreds of thousands
of Parisians

1368
01:38:35,033 --> 01:38:37,400
will be... slaughtered.

1369
01:38:41,709 --> 01:38:45,807
The French people
will never forgive the Allies

1370
01:38:45,848 --> 01:38:48,409
for not coming to their aid.

1371
01:38:50,555 --> 01:38:52,080
Never.

1372
01:39:21,334 --> 01:39:23,394
You're very eloquent.

1373
01:39:23,504 --> 01:39:24,937
As a matter of fact,
what you told us

1374
01:39:24,972 --> 01:39:26,340
is exactly what
General de Gaulle's

1375
01:39:26,376 --> 01:39:27,343
been telling Eisenhower.

1376
01:39:27,377 --> 01:39:28,777
I'm contacting Bradley
immediately.

1377
01:39:28,813 --> 01:39:30,247
You must send us a unit a once.

1378
01:39:30,282 --> 01:39:31,681
You can tell General Leclerc

1379
01:39:31,717 --> 01:39:33,379
that I may have
some news for him.

1380
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:34,580
Leclerc? Is he here?

1381
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:36,419
Yes, he arrives in a few hours.

1382
01:39:36,457 --> 01:39:37,925
Anyway, congratulations.

1383
01:39:37,959 --> 01:39:39,722
I think you made
a good impression.

1384
01:39:39,762 --> 01:39:41,627
Come on,
let's get something to eat.

1385
01:39:41,664 --> 01:39:42,962
You must be hungry, eh?

1386
01:40:30,634 --> 01:40:32,431
Please.

1387
01:40:38,478 --> 01:40:40,504
Here we can talk quietly.

1388
01:40:45,054 --> 01:40:46,385
Have a seat.

1389
01:40:55,068 --> 01:40:58,596
Your cease-fire
didn't work out as you planned.

1390
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:02,101
The situation
is worse than before.

1391
01:41:02,147 --> 01:41:04,742
The Allies have crossed
the Seine near Mantes,

1392
01:41:04,784 --> 01:41:06,616
so if our information
is correct,

1393
01:41:06,653 --> 01:41:08,450
they'll encircle Paris shortly.

1394
01:41:08,488 --> 01:41:11,219
Then I must take
drastic measures

1395
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:14,355
and begin the demolition
of the city.

1396
01:41:14,397 --> 01:41:19,462
Really mean to destroy the city?

1397
01:41:21,574 --> 01:41:25,740
If that cease-fire of yours
had worked out...

1398
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,441
We did our best.

1399
01:41:27,482 --> 01:41:31,614
Nobody can control
the Resistance now.

1400
01:41:34,393 --> 01:41:37,261
If de Gaulle were here...

1401
01:41:37,297 --> 01:41:40,291
Why doesn't anybody
get in touch with him

1402
01:41:40,335 --> 01:41:41,666
and ask his help?

1403
01:41:45,442 --> 01:41:46,932
With de Gaulle?

1404
01:41:46,977 --> 01:41:49,640
It's the only way Paris
will ever be safe

1405
01:41:49,681 --> 01:41:51,843
from destruction.

1406
01:41:51,884 --> 01:41:55,982
The Resistance is going
to force my hand otherwise.

1407
01:41:56,024 --> 01:41:59,188
This is the final order
Hitler gave me.

1408
01:41:59,228 --> 01:42:01,892
Destroy the entire city
of Paris.

1409
01:42:01,932 --> 01:42:03,365
Herr Consul, do what you can.

1410
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:04,664
I've issued this for you:

1411
01:42:04,703 --> 01:42:07,470
a pass that will get you safely
through the German lines.

1412
01:42:07,575 --> 01:42:10,568
Why are you doing this?

1413
01:42:10,613 --> 01:42:14,745
Herr Consul, if I thought
that the destruction of Paris

1414
01:42:14,786 --> 01:42:17,017
could win the war for Germany,

1415
01:42:17,056 --> 01:42:18,854
I would set the city
on fire myself.

1416
01:42:18,892 --> 01:42:20,826
But...

1417
01:42:23,164 --> 01:42:25,258
...we've lost the war.

1418
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:27,895
Then...

1419
01:42:27,937 --> 01:42:32,433
why has Hitler ordered
the destruction of Paris?

1420
01:42:32,477 --> 01:42:35,937
Because he's insane.

1421
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:37,974
I know it.

1422
01:42:38,019 --> 01:42:41,355
I saw him in Rastenburg.

1423
01:42:52,173 --> 01:42:54,699
There are two SS officers
waiting for you.

1424
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:13,301
Did you find anything?

1425
01:43:15,441 --> 01:43:18,240
No, Herr General.

1426
01:43:18,278 --> 01:43:19,712
Force of habit.

1427
01:43:33,934 --> 01:43:36,233
Well?

1428
01:43:37,572 --> 01:43:40,543
It concerns a mission
that's rather delicate.

1429
01:43:40,577 --> 01:43:44,209
Well, isn't that
the specialty of the SS?

1430
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:46,981
Delicate missions?

1431
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:48,421
Vice Minister Himmler

1432
01:43:48,456 --> 01:43:49,548
has recently learned

1433
01:43:49,591 --> 01:43:51,560
that the Louvre
has a very valuable tapestry.

1434
01:43:55,767 --> 01:43:57,325
A what?!

1435
01:43:57,368 --> 01:43:58,768
A tapestry.

1436
01:43:58,804 --> 01:44:00,966
It's, uh...
it's called the, uh...

1437
01:44:02,944 --> 01:44:04,172
...the Bayeux Tapestry.

1438
01:44:04,212 --> 01:44:05,475
11th Century.

1439
01:44:05,514 --> 01:44:09,452
It shows the Norman
invasion of England.

1440
01:44:09,486 --> 01:44:11,511
The Vice Minister
would like us to bring it

1441
01:44:11,622 --> 01:44:12,885
as a gift for the Fuhrer.

1442
01:44:15,063 --> 01:44:16,691
Huh.

1443
01:44:18,067 --> 01:44:21,937
Instead of the real invasion
of England.

1444
01:44:21,973 --> 01:44:24,135
I don't find that
so amusing, Herr General.

1445
01:44:24,176 --> 01:44:29,639
Well, gentlemen,
you can have the tapestry.

1446
01:44:29,683 --> 01:44:31,743
We were certain we could
count on you, Herr General.

1447
01:44:31,786 --> 01:44:36,316
Only the Louvre is in the hands
of the Resistance.

1448
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,761
But the Louvre
is just over there.

1449
01:44:38,796 --> 01:44:40,093
Ja. The only question is,

1450
01:44:40,131 --> 01:44:42,498
will it still be there when
we get through blasting it?

1451
01:44:42,534 --> 01:44:44,560
But why don't you try
to bargain with the French?

1452
01:44:44,671 --> 01:44:46,105
Go with a white flag
in your hand.

1453
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:48,542
You never know. They could
give it to you as a present.

1454
01:44:51,649 --> 01:44:52,878
Gentlemen, good day.
Heil Hitler.

1455
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:54,680
Heil Hitler!

1456
01:45:06,002 --> 01:45:09,268
We represent the ministers
of the Provisional government.

1457
01:45:09,307 --> 01:45:11,538
The cease-fire
has at least permitted us

1458
01:45:11,610 --> 01:45:12,976
to occupy the buildings.

1459
01:45:13,012 --> 01:45:14,708
But we must make
one more step

1460
01:45:14,748 --> 01:45:16,773
toward installing
the new government

1461
01:45:16,817 --> 01:45:21,053
by holding a meeting
of the new cabinet.

1462
01:45:21,092 --> 01:45:23,152
Let's say, at 6:00.

1463
01:45:23,195 --> 01:45:24,390
Right.

1464
01:45:24,431 --> 01:45:26,399
Then we'll have to
take the Maintenon.

1465
01:45:26,433 --> 01:45:28,095
Pierrelot will
take care of that.

1466
01:45:28,135 --> 01:45:29,467
The Maintenon?

1467
01:45:29,504 --> 01:45:30,664
Maintenon Palace.

1468
01:45:30,706 --> 01:45:31,731
Ah.

1469
01:45:31,774 --> 01:45:33,036
Traditionally, that's where

1470
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:34,567
all cabinet meetings
take place.

1471
01:45:34,645 --> 01:45:36,739
I don't think there are
any Germans there,

1472
01:45:36,781 --> 01:45:39,012
but I understand that
a group of collaborators

1473
01:45:39,051 --> 01:45:40,575
are still occupying
the building.

1474
01:45:40,686 --> 01:45:43,212
Do you think they'll try
to keep us out?

1475
01:45:43,256 --> 01:45:46,591
We know that some of
them are against us.

1476
01:45:47,629 --> 01:45:49,257
You never can tell.

1477
01:45:49,299 --> 01:45:51,099
Take "0 men along with you.

1478
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,936
That should do it.

1479
01:45:53,974 --> 01:45:55,602
"0 men, huh?

1480
01:45:55,710 --> 01:45:58,509
Well, I guess
I better get going.

1481
01:45:58,547 --> 01:45:59,605
Claire, start telephoning.

1482
01:45:59,715 --> 01:46:00,876
All right.

1483
01:46:00,917 --> 01:46:04,285
Gentlemen, see you at 6:00
for the cabinet meeting.

1484
01:46:07,259 --> 01:46:08,784
At the Maintenon.

1485
01:46:10,631 --> 01:46:13,499
Where else?

1486
01:46:13,535 --> 01:46:16,630
Hello? Is Marcelle in?

1487
01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:18,367
He's not there?

1488
01:46:34,733 --> 01:46:36,531
- Well?
- Nobody can go with you.

1489
01:46:36,569 --> 01:46:37,661
Did you reach Maurice?

1490
01:46:37,737 --> 01:46:38,864
He can't leave the office.

1491
01:46:38,906 --> 01:46:40,203
The Germans are guarding
the street.

1492
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,265
And Joliot?

1493
01:46:41,309 --> 01:46:42,606
At the town hall
it's the same thing.

1494
01:46:42,644 --> 01:46:43,771
Well, I'll go alone.

1495
01:46:43,813 --> 01:46:44,939
I'll go with you.

1496
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:49,575
Over there.
Go on.

1497
01:46:49,617 --> 01:46:50,744
Hurry.

1498
01:46:50,786 --> 01:46:51,912
Pardon, monsieur.

1499
01:46:51,954 --> 01:46:53,012
Yes?

1500
01:46:53,055 --> 01:46:54,580
Do you know where
the Maintenon is?

1501
01:46:54,624 --> 01:46:55,594
Over there, monsieur.

1502
01:46:55,628 --> 01:46:56,595
The Prime Minister's house?

1503
01:46:56,696 --> 01:46:58,358
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry,
across the Seine.

1504
01:46:58,398 --> 01:46:59,524
Rue de Varenne, yes.
Go on.

1505
01:46:59,566 --> 01:47:00,534
Rue de Varenne?

1506
01:47:00,568 --> 01:47:02,058
Oh, there's
a sentry box in front.

1507
01:47:02,103 --> 01:47:03,071
You can't miss it.

1508
01:47:03,105 --> 01:47:04,072
And be careful.

1509
01:47:04,106 --> 01:47:05,438
They're shooting everywhere.

1510
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:32,204
We'll get ourselves killed.

1511
01:47:32,248 --> 01:47:34,444
Come.

1512
01:47:57,911 --> 01:48:00,006
What do we do now?

1513
01:48:00,048 --> 01:48:01,346
Eh...

1514
01:48:02,519 --> 01:48:04,215
Let's go.

1515
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,375
What do you want?

1516
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:21,742
The officer in command.

1517
01:48:32,764 --> 01:48:35,029
Major, there is
someone to see you.

1518
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:46,109
I'm the officer in charge.

1519
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:47,310
What do you want?

1520
01:48:47,351 --> 01:48:49,650
I have come to take
possession here

1521
01:48:49,754 --> 01:48:53,749
in the name of the Provisional
Government of the Republic.

1522
01:48:57,398 --> 01:49:01,268
Monsieur Le ministre, I've
always been for the Republic.

1523
01:49:01,304 --> 01:49:03,330
I place myself at your disposal.

1524
01:49:03,374 --> 01:49:06,278
Thank you, Major.

1525
01:49:07,748 --> 01:49:10,115
Detail, fall in.

1526
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:19,488
You forgot to put armbands on.

1527
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:25,205
Attention!

1528
01:49:28,711 --> 01:49:30,703
Close ranks.

1529
01:49:33,919 --> 01:49:36,481
Present arms.

1530
01:49:50,543 --> 01:49:52,671
The staff welcomes you,
Monsieur Le ministre.

1531
01:49:52,713 --> 01:49:53,680
Thank you.

1532
01:49:53,714 --> 01:49:55,012
Take me to the Council Hall.

1533
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:56,348
If Monsieur Le ministre
will follow me.

1534
01:49:56,385 --> 01:49:57,352
Who are you?

1535
01:49:57,386 --> 01:49:58,284
Switchboard operator.

1536
01:49:58,321 --> 01:49:59,289
Go back to your switchboard.

1537
01:49:59,323 --> 01:50:00,290
And you?

1538
01:50:00,324 --> 01:50:01,383
Chief librarian, monsieur.

1539
01:50:01,426 --> 01:50:02,757
Return to your library.

1540
01:50:21,689 --> 01:50:23,055
The meeting starts
in two hours.

1541
01:50:23,092 --> 01:50:24,320
How many will you be,
monsieur?

1542
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:25,328
Around "0.

1543
01:50:25,362 --> 01:50:26,659
Very well.

1544
01:50:26,696 --> 01:50:29,097
The Prime Minister's desk.

1545
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,500
Ah, monsieur, I've seen
governments come and go,

1546
01:50:36,543 --> 01:50:38,444
but nothing like the last one.

1547
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,508
They took
everything they could.

1548
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:43,214
Even the silverware.

1549
01:50:43,255 --> 01:50:45,315
And here is the Council Hall.

1550
01:50:45,358 --> 01:50:46,552
Not bad.

1551
01:50:46,593 --> 01:50:49,496
Would you please provide
some pencils and erasers?

1552
01:50:49,531 --> 01:50:51,499
And ink and scratch pads.

1553
01:50:51,534 --> 01:50:52,558
In other words,

1554
01:50:52,602 --> 01:50:56,404
the usual preparations
for Council meetings.

1555
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:57,533
Good.

1556
01:50:57,575 --> 01:51:00,807
And we will also need
rooms for the night.

1557
01:51:00,846 --> 01:51:01,814
Bedrooms.

1558
01:51:01,848 --> 01:51:02,974
I assume
Monsieur Le ministre

1559
01:51:03,016 --> 01:51:04,985
will the want the Green Room
for his personal use?

1560
01:51:05,019 --> 01:51:06,487
The Green Room?

1561
01:51:06,522 --> 01:51:08,855
It's always reserved
for the Prime Minister.

1562
01:51:18,773 --> 01:51:22,005
My, my.

1563
01:51:22,044 --> 01:51:23,512
Hmm, adequate.

1564
01:51:45,513 --> 01:51:48,039
Excuse me.

1565
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,915
Excuse me.

1566
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,549
I know exactly how you feel,
my son.

1567
01:51:53,591 --> 01:51:55,560
But no emotion.

1568
01:51:55,594 --> 01:51:57,119
The facts.

1569
01:51:57,163 --> 01:51:59,962
If you don't march
immediately on Paris,

1570
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,299
they'll destroy the entire city.

1571
01:52:02,337 --> 01:52:04,863
The situation is
as serious as that?

1572
01:52:04,907 --> 01:52:05,896
I'm afraid so.

1573
01:52:05,941 --> 01:52:08,433
You must begin
your drive on Paris...

1574
01:52:08,478 --> 01:52:10,447
tomorrow.

1575
01:52:10,481 --> 01:52:12,677
I should personally
like nothing better.

1576
01:52:12,718 --> 01:52:15,483
And I'm doing all I can
to convince headquarters,

1577
01:52:15,522 --> 01:52:18,552
but you can't push an
armored division around

1578
01:52:18,595 --> 01:52:20,290
like a wheelbarrow.

1579
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:22,060
We've just fought
a battle at Argenton.

1580
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:23,534
We're very far from Paris.

1581
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:29,000
I could make it.

1582
01:52:30,746 --> 01:52:33,045
But I would have to receive
the orders today.

1583
01:52:33,082 --> 01:52:34,379
And if not?

1584
01:52:34,417 --> 01:52:36,682
If not?

1585
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:39,519
We'll see what we can do.

1586
01:52:39,558 --> 01:52:44,395
General de Gaulle will end up
by convincing the Allies.

1587
01:52:44,431 --> 01:52:48,666
And now, tell me everything.

1588
01:52:48,705 --> 01:52:53,508
Well, where's General Bradley?

1589
01:52:53,545 --> 01:52:58,541
If he's not here before 7:00,
it's going to be too late.

1590
01:53:00,555 --> 01:53:03,958
I've got to get that order
before tonight.

1591
01:53:03,994 --> 01:53:06,292
Ah, here he is.

1592
01:57:23,604 --> 01:57:26,404
Well, I got the news
I was waiting for, Sibert.

1593
01:57:26,442 --> 01:57:27,932
Where is he?

1594
01:57:41,965 --> 01:57:43,524
You win.

1595
01:57:43,567 --> 01:57:47,561
The decision has been made
to go into Paris,

1596
01:57:47,606 --> 01:57:49,632
and the three of us
hold the responsibility

1597
01:57:49,675 --> 01:57:50,802
for that decision.

1598
01:57:50,844 --> 01:57:53,109
I, because I'm giving the order,

1599
01:57:53,147 --> 01:57:54,671
you, General Leclerc,

1600
01:57:54,716 --> 01:57:56,514
because you are going
to execute it,

1601
01:57:56,552 --> 01:57:57,679
and you, Major Gallois,

1602
01:57:57,721 --> 01:57:59,279
because you brought us
the information

1603
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:02,417
that led us to that decision.

1604
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:04,953
Thank you.

1605
01:58:17,817 --> 01:58:19,683
How do you feel, Major?

1606
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,713
Hmm? Oh, I haven't slept
in three days.

1607
01:58:22,758 --> 01:58:24,020
I promise you
a full day's sleep.

1608
01:58:24,059 --> 01:58:25,755
But right now
I'm sending you down to G-2,

1609
01:58:25,795 --> 01:58:27,423
and tomorrow you can
join General Leclerc

1610
01:58:27,464 --> 01:58:28,954
at Ramboullier.

1611
01:58:40,983 --> 01:58:42,977
Rebius?

1612
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,818
We're moving on to Paris.

1613
01:58:47,861 --> 01:58:49,853
Is that your son, Lieutenant?

1614
01:58:51,367 --> 01:58:53,700
He was two then.

1615
01:58:53,737 --> 01:58:57,196
And now he's four years old.

1616
01:58:57,241 --> 01:58:59,767
I've never seen him.

1617
01:58:59,812 --> 01:59:01,303
Off your behinds!

1618
01:59:01,347 --> 01:59:03,009
We're marching on to Paris!

1619
01:59:04,652 --> 01:59:06,883
I'd better
shave off my beard

1620
01:59:06,922 --> 01:59:09,357
before my wife sees it.

1621
01:59:11,495 --> 01:59:13,225
This is it.

1622
01:59:13,264 --> 01:59:14,790
We're going to Paris!

1623
01:59:53,190 --> 01:59:55,990
Dampierre!

1624
01:59:56,028 --> 01:59:58,088
That way, there.

1625
01:59:58,131 --> 01:59:59,428
Where are you going?

1626
01:59:59,466 --> 02:00:00,433
To Paris!

1627
02:00:00,468 --> 02:00:01,935
Paris?!

1628
02:00:01,969 --> 02:00:05,304
Well, you've still got
a long way to go.

1629
02:00:05,341 --> 02:00:08,277
I have an aunt who has
a restaurant in Montparnasse.

1630
02:00:08,312 --> 02:00:10,213
We can eat off her
for ten years.

1631
02:00:10,248 --> 02:00:12,045
Is that near the Bastille?

1632
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:13,711
Not the Bastille.

1633
02:00:13,753 --> 02:00:16,484
I said Montparnasse,
peasant.

1634
02:00:57,818 --> 02:00:59,514
They signed off, sir.

1635
02:00:59,554 --> 02:01:01,648
Fine. Message finished.

1636
02:01:11,704 --> 02:01:15,870
Two German panzer divisions
have started out for Paris.

1637
02:01:15,911 --> 02:01:17,812
Call all the other units.

1638
02:01:17,847 --> 02:01:19,371
We must notify them.

1639
02:01:19,415 --> 02:01:21,316
Go on, quickly, quickly.

1640
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:28,994
Orders from the General.

1641
02:01:29,031 --> 02:01:30,897
All units accelerate.

1642
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:55,589
Where is Leclerc now?

1643
02:02:55,623 --> 02:02:57,683
They're moving,
they're going all out

1644
02:02:57,726 --> 02:03:00,323
but they're still more
than 50 kilometers away.

1645
02:03:00,365 --> 02:03:04,201
Mm. That's about "0 miles.

1646
02:03:06,908 --> 02:03:08,433
You know,
we can't run the risk

1647
02:03:08,477 --> 02:03:10,468
that German general
might just suddenly

1648
02:03:10,512 --> 02:03:13,677
change his mind
and destroy the city.

1649
02:03:13,717 --> 02:03:16,380
So Leclerc has quite
a job on his hands.

1650
02:03:19,058 --> 02:03:21,493
Tell Hodges to keep
the Fourth Division ready

1651
02:03:21,528 --> 02:03:22,894
just in case.

1652
02:03:28,939 --> 02:03:31,172
Look, the Eiffel Tower...
that's on the...

1653
02:03:31,211 --> 02:03:33,237
the right side of the river,
right?

1654
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,044
The Right Bank?

1655
02:03:35,083 --> 02:03:36,710
The left.

1656
02:03:36,751 --> 02:03:40,689
Well, okay, if the Eiffel Tower
is on the left...

1657
02:03:42,093 --> 02:03:46,224
...that means that the Louvre
is on the right, yeah?

1658
02:03:46,265 --> 02:03:49,064
And the Chambre of,
what do you call it?

1659
02:03:49,102 --> 02:03:50,468
Of Deputes.

1660
02:03:50,505 --> 02:03:52,064
Now, look, will you
just knock it off

1661
02:03:52,174 --> 02:03:53,198
and quit bothering me?

1662
02:03:53,242 --> 02:03:55,404
Yeah, but you've been to Paris
and I haven't.

1663
02:03:55,445 --> 02:03:57,414
Boy, I never thought
in a thousand years

1664
02:03:57,448 --> 02:03:58,540
I'd get to see Paris.

1665
02:03:58,582 --> 02:04:01,485
Yeah. See Paris and die.

1666
02:04:01,521 --> 02:04:04,856
No, that's... that's Naples.

1667
02:04:07,129 --> 02:04:10,258
What do you think
happens when you die?

1668
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:12,895
You go to Naples.

1669
02:04:15,007 --> 02:04:17,442
Funny.

1670
02:04:17,477 --> 02:04:19,742
Start unloading those
bazookas there, Sergeant.

1671
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:21,043
We going into Paris, Lieutenant?

1672
02:04:21,082 --> 02:04:22,174
Yeah, we're moving out.

1673
02:04:44,618 --> 02:04:46,609
Oh! The telephone's working!

1674
02:04:48,523 --> 02:04:50,321
We can call Paris!

1675
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:52,089
We can call Paris!

1676
02:04:52,195 --> 02:04:54,494
We can call...

1677
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,869
Hey! The telephone's working!

1678
02:04:58,904 --> 02:05:00,634
We can telephone Paris.

1679
02:05:00,673 --> 02:05:02,938
Hey, Maurice,
the telephone's working.

1680
02:05:02,977 --> 02:05:04,502
You can call your house.

1681
02:05:04,546 --> 02:05:06,481
Madame, please.

1682
02:05:06,515 --> 02:05:09,578
Put a call through for me
to Elysees "-2-2-6.

1683
02:05:09,622 --> 02:05:10,782
It's my parents.

1684
02:05:10,823 --> 02:05:12,382
My mother, Madame Bovera.

1685
02:05:12,425 --> 02:05:14,656
Tell her I'm coming
with the Black Berets.

1686
02:05:14,695 --> 02:05:15,958
You've come a long way?

1687
02:05:15,998 --> 02:05:17,056
Yes.

1688
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:17,827
Sahara.

1689
02:05:17,866 --> 02:05:18,856
Sahara?

1690
02:05:35,759 --> 02:05:36,817
Mama!

1691
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:38,853
It's Mama.

1692
02:05:38,897 --> 02:05:40,092
It's me, Henri.

1693
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:42,691
Put-put the champagne
on ice.

1694
02:05:42,736 --> 02:05:44,203
We're coming!

1695
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:46,230
How much do I owe you?

1696
02:05:47,576 --> 02:05:48,543
May I?

1697
02:05:48,577 --> 02:05:49,566
Of course.

1698
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:55,617
Hello?

1699
02:05:55,654 --> 02:05:57,748
C'est beau l'accuell...?

1700
02:05:57,791 --> 02:05:58,917
Hold on, please.

1701
02:05:58,958 --> 02:06:00,085
Here you are.

1702
02:06:02,664 --> 02:06:03,961
Hello?

1703
02:06:03,999 --> 02:06:07,095
Hello, it's me.

1704
02:06:07,137 --> 02:06:08,434
It's me!

1705
02:06:08,472 --> 02:06:10,805
But it's true,
I tell you, it's me!

1706
02:06:10,842 --> 02:06:12,107
I say it's me. Me!

1707
02:06:12,146 --> 02:06:13,774
Tell her your name,
it'll be quicker.

1708
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,078
Huh?

1709
02:06:15,117 --> 02:06:16,107
All right, who are you?

1710
02:06:16,152 --> 02:06:17,119
Georges.

1711
02:06:17,153 --> 02:06:18,815
All right. Hello. It's Georges.

1712
02:06:18,856 --> 02:06:20,118
I mean, I'm not Georges.

1713
02:06:20,157 --> 02:06:21,591
I mean, yes, it's Georges.

1714
02:06:21,626 --> 02:06:23,458
I'm calling for Georges.

1715
02:06:24,497 --> 02:06:25,464
But he can't speak.

1716
02:06:25,498 --> 02:06:26,466
He's too excited.

1717
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:27,831
Hey, Georges, we're leaving!

1718
02:06:27,868 --> 02:06:28,836
He's in Arpageon.

1719
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:30,462
Tell her we're on the way.
On the way.

1720
02:06:30,505 --> 02:06:31,473
He's on the way.

1721
02:06:31,507 --> 02:06:32,735
Yes, and I give her a kiss.

1722
02:06:32,775 --> 02:06:33,743
He's on the way.

1723
02:06:33,777 --> 02:06:35,176
He gives you a kiss.
He loves you.

1724
02:06:35,245 --> 02:06:36,144
I love her.
I love her.

1725
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:38,581
Good-bye, Madame.

1726
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:48,094
Where have you come from?

1727
02:06:48,133 --> 02:06:50,967
From Paris.

1728
02:07:09,263 --> 02:07:12,392
Here are the locations
for the mines.

1729
02:07:12,434 --> 02:07:13,765
Uh-huh.

1730
02:07:16,774 --> 02:07:17,934
Fine.

1731
02:07:17,975 --> 02:07:19,773
Then we move
on to the next site.

1732
02:08:16,694 --> 02:08:19,129
One hour and it's all finished.

1733
02:08:47,539 --> 02:08:50,237
They're going to have
such a show of fireworks,

1734
02:08:50,277 --> 02:08:52,713
they'll think the whole world
is burning.

1735
02:08:52,748 --> 02:08:54,045
We are going home

1736
02:08:54,083 --> 02:08:55,346
to Berlin!

1737
02:08:55,385 --> 02:08:57,376
We are going home to Berlin!

1738
02:08:57,422 --> 02:08:59,447
We'll be back for Christmas!

1739
02:09:43,389 --> 02:09:45,186
Wait a minute, stop pushing.

1740
02:09:47,394 --> 02:09:49,158
General Leclerc
asks me to tell you

1741
02:09:49,196 --> 02:09:50,494
that they're on the march...

1742
02:09:50,532 --> 02:09:51,658
to hold fast!

1743
02:10:05,822 --> 02:10:07,119
Hey, believe it or not,

1744
02:10:07,157 --> 02:10:10,651
we're passing right
in front of my house.

1745
02:10:10,696 --> 02:10:12,324
I live on the corner.

1746
02:10:12,365 --> 02:10:14,800
Our kitchen is just
above the restaurant,

1747
02:10:14,835 --> 02:10:16,997
and I used to get
my cigarettes

1748
02:10:17,038 --> 02:10:18,972
at the shop across the way.

1749
02:10:20,443 --> 02:10:22,207
You know,
I said to my wife,

1750
02:10:22,245 --> 02:10:23,405
"I'll be back.

1751
02:10:23,447 --> 02:10:25,882
I'm going to get
a pack of cigarettes. "

1752
02:10:25,917 --> 02:10:27,944
The funny part is,
I didn't go back.

1753
02:10:27,987 --> 02:10:30,548
I signed up with De Gaulle.

1754
02:10:30,591 --> 02:10:33,561
What will you
tell your wife?

1755
02:10:33,595 --> 02:10:36,464
I've got the pack
of cigarettes... Camels.

1756
02:10:48,617 --> 02:10:50,586
All right, on your feet.

1757
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:52,087
Hurry, hurry.

1758
02:10:52,122 --> 02:10:53,750
What is it now?

1759
02:10:53,791 --> 02:10:55,555
You can come out.

1760
02:10:55,594 --> 02:10:57,255
Oh, about time.

1761
02:10:57,295 --> 02:11:00,028
What's going on?

1762
02:11:00,068 --> 02:11:01,468
You've got work to do.

1763
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,665
Oh, work.

1764
02:11:02,706 --> 02:11:03,866
Yeah.

1765
02:11:03,907 --> 02:11:05,773
Hurry.

1766
02:11:22,033 --> 02:11:23,227
It's a tank.

1767
02:11:23,268 --> 02:11:25,897
55 meters. Direct target.

1768
02:11:25,938 --> 02:11:27,099
First, they put you in jail.

1769
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:29,666
Then, they want you
to defend it.

1770
02:11:32,483 --> 02:11:34,281
Fire. Fire.

1771
02:12:54,335 --> 02:12:55,666
What are you doing there, Daum?

1772
02:12:55,703 --> 02:12:57,103
We're joining
the regiment, sir.

1773
02:12:57,139 --> 02:12:58,232
That's stupid.

1774
02:12:58,274 --> 02:12:59,764
Yes, but those are the orders.

1775
02:12:59,809 --> 02:13:01,402
You should never
obey stupid orders.

1776
02:13:01,445 --> 02:13:03,539
Sir, they tell me
there is a clear road ahead.

1777
02:13:03,581 --> 02:13:05,573
Good. You're starting
immediately for Paris.

1778
02:13:05,618 --> 02:13:07,985
Don't worry about
the Germans. Just go.

1779
02:13:08,021 --> 02:13:09,513
Don't stop for anything.

1780
02:13:09,558 --> 02:13:11,891
Tell the Parisians we're coming.

1781
02:13:11,928 --> 02:13:13,920
We'll be there... tomorrow.

1782
02:13:13,965 --> 02:13:15,058
Very well, sir.

1783
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:16,590
Go on.

1784
02:13:16,635 --> 02:13:17,898
Daum!

1785
02:13:17,937 --> 02:13:20,498
Didn't I tell you
to clean that up?

1786
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:22,236
There was no time, sir.

1787
02:13:22,277 --> 02:13:25,304
In Paris we have
to look our best.

1788
02:13:26,882 --> 02:13:28,544
Hey!

1789
02:13:41,872 --> 02:13:43,339
Who are they?

1790
02:13:43,374 --> 02:13:44,501
They're Germans.

1791
02:13:44,542 --> 02:13:45,975
No, they are Americans.

1792
02:13:46,011 --> 02:13:47,775
Get away from the window.

1793
02:13:47,813 --> 02:13:49,805
Juliet, come inside. Juliet!

1794
02:13:53,354 --> 02:13:54,652
Why, they're American.

1795
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:55,884
The Americans?

1796
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:00,597
It's the Americans!

1797
02:14:00,631 --> 02:14:01,997
The Americans.

1798
02:14:11,113 --> 02:14:13,107
No, they're French!

1799
02:14:15,855 --> 02:14:17,516
Oh, they are French.

1800
02:14:19,994 --> 02:14:21,189
They're French!

1801
02:14:25,869 --> 02:14:28,031
I can't believe it!

1802
02:14:30,876 --> 02:14:33,311
Say, what's the shortest way
to the town hall?

1803
02:14:33,346 --> 02:14:35,008
It's very simple, Captain.

1804
02:14:35,049 --> 02:14:36,607
You take the Avenue de...

1805
02:14:39,355 --> 02:14:40,822
Take the Rue de la Piscine.

1806
02:14:40,857 --> 02:14:42,018
Thank you. Thank you.

1807
02:16:08,521 --> 02:16:12,982
Why are the bells
ringing like that?

1808
02:16:13,026 --> 02:16:16,122
Herr General...

1809
02:16:16,165 --> 02:16:21,266
They're announcing our funeral,
my dear Fraulein Irma.

1810
02:16:21,307 --> 02:16:26,440
Would you connect me
with General Spiedel?

1811
02:16:26,481 --> 02:16:29,451
Put a call through
to General Spiedel.

1812
02:16:29,485 --> 02:16:33,389
Why do you look
so surprised, all of you?

1813
02:16:33,424 --> 02:16:36,861
You thought a miracle
would save us, huh?

1814
02:16:36,896 --> 02:16:40,425
None of you seems to realize
what's happening...

1815
02:16:40,468 --> 02:16:43,461
in Russia, in Germany...

1816
02:16:43,539 --> 02:16:46,908
or even what's happening
now in Normandy.

1817
02:16:46,944 --> 02:16:48,104
After the past few months,

1818
02:16:48,145 --> 02:16:51,206
I don't think anything
could surprise me.

1819
02:16:51,249 --> 02:16:54,312
General Spiedel.

1820
02:16:54,355 --> 02:16:56,482
Good evening, Spiedel.

1821
02:16:56,524 --> 02:16:59,791
There is something
you should hear.

1822
02:17:01,031 --> 02:17:02,829
Bells?

1823
02:17:02,867 --> 02:17:04,733
Ja, they are ringing.

1824
02:17:04,770 --> 02:17:08,002
They've been silent
for four and a half years.

1825
02:17:08,041 --> 02:17:13,071
They're ringing to announce
the arrival of the Allies.

1826
02:17:13,114 --> 02:17:16,210
And now will you send me
those divisions

1827
02:17:16,253 --> 02:17:18,688
you promised us
almost a month ago?

1828
02:17:18,723 --> 02:17:19,781
Unfortunately, no.

1829
02:17:19,824 --> 02:17:22,350
Our reserves
are completely exhausted.

1830
02:17:22,394 --> 02:17:26,061
Ja, then, dear Spiedel.

1831
02:17:26,102 --> 02:17:30,473
I would appreciate you
doing a favor for me.

1832
02:17:30,542 --> 02:17:34,912
See that my family
doesn't suffer.

1833
02:17:34,947 --> 02:17:37,645
Thank you. Ja.

1834
02:18:46,652 --> 02:18:51,091
Hmm. Napoleon's tomb.

1835
02:18:51,125 --> 02:18:53,151
All his victories:

1836
02:18:53,195 --> 02:18:54,823
Marengo,

1837
02:18:54,864 --> 02:18:57,095
Austerlitz,

1838
02:18:57,134 --> 02:18:58,260
lena,

1839
02:18:58,302 --> 02:18:59,827
Freidland,

1840
02:18:59,871 --> 02:19:02,342
Wagram,

1841
02:19:02,377 --> 02:19:03,844
Moscow.

1842
02:19:05,647 --> 02:19:09,483
Moscow...

1843
02:19:09,587 --> 02:19:12,284
Von Choltitz here.

1844
02:19:12,324 --> 02:19:13,450
The Fuhrer wants to know

1845
02:19:13,492 --> 02:19:15,791
are you ready to proceed
with the burning of Paris?

1846
02:19:15,828 --> 02:19:17,854
Of course, General Jodl,
of course.

1847
02:19:17,898 --> 02:19:20,493
All the charges
have been placed

1848
02:19:20,535 --> 02:19:22,629
under the Louvre
and the Eiffel Tower.

1849
02:19:22,671 --> 02:19:23,900
What are you waiting for?

1850
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:26,171
Why the delay?
What's holding you up?

1851
02:19:26,210 --> 02:19:29,806
All the demolitions are set
for the fortified bridges,

1852
02:19:29,848 --> 02:19:31,680
for all of the waterworks.

1853
02:19:31,718 --> 02:19:33,814
Then I see no reason
for you to delay any longer.

1854
02:19:33,856 --> 02:19:36,826
Give the order
for total destruction.

1855
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:38,761
The minute that
all our occupation units

1856
02:19:38,797 --> 02:19:40,288
have evacuated the city.

1857
02:19:40,332 --> 02:19:41,663
It should've been done already!

1858
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:43,532
The Fuhrer wants
the city burned now!

1859
02:19:43,570 --> 02:19:44,764
Is that clear?!

1860
02:21:35,533 --> 02:21:36,933
Do you know where my son is?

1861
02:21:36,969 --> 02:21:37,958
What's his name?

1862
02:21:38,003 --> 02:21:39,096
Maurice Bovera.

1863
02:21:39,138 --> 02:21:40,537
Don't know him.

1864
02:21:53,493 --> 02:21:55,394
Where are the Black Berets?

1865
02:21:55,429 --> 02:21:56,396
Over there.

1866
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:59,093
Thank you.

1867
02:22:34,953 --> 02:22:36,011
Colonel Fabien.

1868
02:22:36,056 --> 02:22:37,921
We are ordered to support
your attack on the...

1869
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:40,127
Careful!

1870
02:22:40,161 --> 02:22:42,130
Lieutenant Delafu Chartiere.
Second division.

1871
02:22:42,164 --> 02:22:43,564
The only way to get those Nazis

1872
02:22:43,599 --> 02:22:44,930
is to climb up there.
You see?

1873
02:22:44,967 --> 02:22:46,096
All right.

1874
02:22:46,138 --> 02:22:47,765
Marco, Jacques, you cover us.

1875
02:22:47,807 --> 02:22:49,036
- Yes, sir.
- Ready?

1876
02:23:27,664 --> 02:23:29,599
Lieutenant Pierre
Delafu Chartiere.

1877
02:23:29,667 --> 02:23:32,364
Second Armored Division.

1878
02:23:32,404 --> 02:23:34,965
My respects, Madame.

1879
02:23:41,985 --> 02:23:43,043
Oh, please, after you.

1880
02:23:43,086 --> 02:23:44,111
This way, please.

1881
02:23:47,092 --> 02:23:49,152
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1882
02:23:49,195 --> 02:23:52,929
You mustn't force it.

1883
02:23:52,968 --> 02:23:53,993
Careful.

1884
02:23:54,037 --> 02:23:56,165
They're over there,
across the street.

1885
02:23:56,207 --> 02:23:58,676
Better step back, Madame.

1886
02:24:02,282 --> 02:24:04,251
I want a man at each window.

1887
02:24:04,285 --> 02:24:05,253
Yes, sir.

1888
02:24:05,287 --> 02:24:06,720
Ooh, careful.
Prepare the grenades.

1889
02:24:06,755 --> 02:24:07,882
Right here.

1890
02:24:07,924 --> 02:24:09,916
You, you got everything ready?

1891
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:11,154
Careful, my roses there.

1892
02:24:11,195 --> 02:24:12,527
Oh, I'm sorry.

1893
02:24:12,564 --> 02:24:13,895
Oh, please, please, Madame.

1894
02:24:13,932 --> 02:24:15,423
Oh, don't you
worry about me.

1895
02:24:15,467 --> 02:24:16,434
Oh, don't worry...

1896
02:24:16,468 --> 02:24:18,369
Make sure they
don't see you, huh?

1897
02:24:18,405 --> 02:24:21,204
Jacques,
the incendiary grenades?

1898
02:24:21,242 --> 02:24:22,610
Ready, sir.
Good.

1899
02:24:22,646 --> 02:24:23,613
Marco, ready?

1900
02:24:23,647 --> 02:24:24,774
Ready, sir.

1901
02:24:24,816 --> 02:24:26,545
When I give the order,
hit them with everything.

1902
02:24:26,585 --> 02:24:27,883
- Ready?
- Ready.

1903
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:29,148
Ready.

1904
02:24:29,189 --> 02:24:30,451
Go on.

1905
02:24:37,033 --> 02:24:38,934
Perfect.

1906
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:40,198
Fire.

1907
02:25:02,136 --> 02:25:04,002
Cease fire.

1908
02:25:14,353 --> 02:25:15,878
Close it carefully, huh?

1909
02:25:17,458 --> 02:25:20,428
Madame, thank you
for your hospitality.

1910
02:25:20,462 --> 02:25:22,624
Gentlemen, would you pick up
the cartridge shells?

1911
02:25:22,666 --> 02:25:23,997
Very well, sir.

1912
02:25:24,034 --> 02:25:26,003
My respects, Madame.

1913
02:25:26,037 --> 02:25:27,132
Madame.

1914
02:25:27,174 --> 02:25:29,769
All right,
we'd better get going.

1915
02:25:29,811 --> 02:25:30,800
Madame.

1916
02:25:47,466 --> 02:25:49,128
We made it.
We're in Paris.

1917
02:25:49,168 --> 02:25:50,931
Yeah, we haven't made it yet.

1918
02:25:50,970 --> 02:25:52,495
We got to cross
that bridge first.

1919
02:26:06,995 --> 02:26:09,021
Excuse me, ma'am.

1920
02:26:09,065 --> 02:26:10,431
Excuse me.

1921
02:26:10,467 --> 02:26:12,059
Ecole Militaire?

1922
02:26:12,102 --> 02:26:13,161
Oh, right.

1923
02:26:13,204 --> 02:26:14,671
It's there, to the right.

1924
02:26:14,706 --> 02:26:17,301
To the right,
Ecole Militaire, right?

1925
02:26:17,343 --> 02:26:19,039
Yes.

1926
02:26:22,183 --> 02:26:23,310
Please.

1927
02:26:23,352 --> 02:26:25,583
Come on. Come on.

1928
02:26:55,064 --> 02:26:56,089
Hey!

1929
02:26:58,770 --> 02:27:01,467
We've waited
four years for you.

1930
02:27:01,507 --> 02:27:04,240
But America's only been
in the war for three years.

1931
02:27:04,279 --> 02:27:05,371
So what?

1932
02:27:05,414 --> 02:27:07,474
We knew you'd come.

1933
02:27:07,517 --> 02:27:08,746
What's wrong?

1934
02:27:08,786 --> 02:27:10,652
Yeah, well,
he's already got a date.

1935
02:27:10,689 --> 02:27:12,156
But I don't.

1936
02:27:47,743 --> 02:27:49,005
The Captain's looking for you.

1937
02:27:49,045 --> 02:27:50,205
There's a tank over there.

1938
02:27:50,246 --> 02:27:51,509
We've got to knock it out.

1939
02:27:54,853 --> 02:27:56,287
Stop.

1940
02:27:56,322 --> 02:27:57,516
Bombs are here. Come.

1941
02:27:58,659 --> 02:27:59,887
Over here.

1942
02:28:04,333 --> 02:28:05,561
Excuse me, sir.

1943
02:28:05,601 --> 02:28:07,969
Do you happen to have
any bazookas here?

1944
02:28:08,005 --> 02:28:10,099
Yeah, yeah.
It so happens we do.

1945
02:28:11,611 --> 02:28:12,703
Make it fast.

1946
02:28:12,745 --> 02:28:14,714
Cover me, Charlie.
I'm going off with this guy.

1947
02:28:14,748 --> 02:28:16,046
Okay, but watch yourself.

1948
02:28:40,587 --> 02:28:42,385
We're on
the Left Bank, right?

1949
02:28:42,423 --> 02:28:43,390
What?

1950
02:28:43,424 --> 02:28:44,824
Uh, the... the Left Bank.

1951
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:46,521
Yeah, Boulevard San
Michele over there.

1952
02:28:46,562 --> 02:28:48,326
Jardin Luxembourg there.

1953
02:28:48,365 --> 02:28:49,628
Yeah.

1954
02:28:49,667 --> 02:28:51,328
Yeah, the Latin Quarter.

1955
02:28:51,369 --> 02:28:53,304
And, uh, that's not
a nightclub either.

1956
02:28:53,338 --> 02:28:55,330
That's... that's where
the students live, right?

1957
02:28:55,375 --> 02:28:56,968
Yeah, I'll explain later.

1958
02:28:57,011 --> 02:28:58,376
You see that door?

1959
02:28:58,412 --> 02:28:59,846
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1960
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:45,643
We got it!

1961
02:29:45,682 --> 02:29:46,649
We got it!

1962
02:29:46,683 --> 02:29:48,584
Yeah.

1963
02:29:48,619 --> 02:29:50,087
Hey, let's drink to it.

1964
02:29:50,122 --> 02:29:51,089
Yeah, yeah.

1965
02:29:51,123 --> 02:29:52,091
First bar we find?

1966
02:29:52,125 --> 02:29:53,683
First bar we find.

1967
02:29:53,727 --> 02:29:54,717
Okay.

1968
02:29:59,202 --> 02:30:00,692
Oh, that was a bull's-eye.

1969
02:30:00,737 --> 02:30:02,205
Give us whatever you've got.
Quick.

1970
02:30:02,239 --> 02:30:03,729
Quick.

1971
02:30:03,774 --> 02:30:05,675
No, not this one.

1972
02:30:05,710 --> 02:30:06,678
Come on, have a drink.

1973
02:30:06,712 --> 02:30:09,045
We'll open up
a good bottle of Bordeaux.

1974
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:23,503
I've never tasted wine
till we got to Normandy.

1975
02:30:23,538 --> 02:30:25,506
Well, do you like it?

1976
02:30:25,541 --> 02:30:26,565
Yeah, I like it.

1977
02:30:26,609 --> 02:30:28,771
Hey, I hear there's
a war going on.

1978
02:30:28,812 --> 02:30:32,544
Oh, come on,
give me a break, will ya?

1979
02:30:32,583 --> 02:30:34,051
You know,
this is exactly the way

1980
02:30:34,086 --> 02:30:35,349
I thought Paris would be...

1981
02:30:35,388 --> 02:30:38,756
a little place like this,
checkered tablecloths...

1982
02:30:38,793 --> 02:30:40,159
red wine.

1983
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:42,543
Come on, Grandpa,
you've done your share.

1984
02:31:42,586 --> 02:31:43,553
Pardon.

1985
02:31:43,587 --> 02:31:45,215
Yes, come back tomorrow.

1986
02:32:05,654 --> 02:32:08,749
Hey! Psst! Psst!

1987
02:32:12,063 --> 02:32:14,089
Get back inside, for God's sake!

1988
02:32:14,133 --> 02:32:15,964
You'll get yourselves killed!

1989
02:32:16,001 --> 02:32:18,095
Get back!

1990
02:32:18,138 --> 02:32:19,868
They're coming nearer!

1991
02:32:19,941 --> 02:32:22,069
Get ready to fire!

1992
02:32:22,110 --> 02:32:23,874
"00 meters!

1993
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:33,951
Don't stay together!

1994
02:32:38,736 --> 02:32:40,796
Francoise! Francoise!

1995
02:32:40,839 --> 02:32:42,238
Get over here!

1996
02:32:56,161 --> 02:32:57,789
Hurry!

1997
02:32:57,831 --> 02:33:00,266
Go get that machine gun!

1998
02:33:00,301 --> 02:33:01,768
What are you waiting for!

1999
02:33:16,724 --> 02:33:18,021
What's wrong?

2000
02:33:18,059 --> 02:33:19,857
It's jammed.

2001
02:33:57,517 --> 02:33:59,816
One of the tanks got the panzer.

2002
02:33:59,854 --> 02:34:01,824
All right! Let's go!

2003
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:13,737
Good luck to you, Corporal.

2004
02:34:13,775 --> 02:34:15,573
I'll be glad to get back
to my wife.

2005
02:34:15,611 --> 02:34:17,079
She's been waiting six years.

2006
02:34:17,114 --> 02:34:18,604
We all have families.

2007
02:35:07,288 --> 02:35:08,687
A panzer!
Near the obelisk!

2008
02:35:15,632 --> 02:35:16,792
Fire!

2009
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,566
Got it! With the smoke shell!

2010
02:35:29,853 --> 02:35:30,945
He's going to shoot at us!

2011
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:32,648
No time to reload!
Ram him! Ram him!

2012
02:35:44,141 --> 02:35:46,235
A panzer.
Our first in Paris.

2013
02:35:53,522 --> 02:35:54,819
Ah, those cowards.

2014
02:35:54,856 --> 02:35:56,290
They ran away.

2015
02:36:05,405 --> 02:36:07,270
All right, all right. Let's go.

2016
02:36:07,307 --> 02:36:09,004
Let's go.

2017
02:36:09,044 --> 02:36:11,070
Come on!

2018
02:36:13,884 --> 02:36:15,580
Let's go. Back up.

2019
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:17,384
That's right.

2020
02:36:27,867 --> 02:36:29,733
We made it at last.

2021
02:36:29,770 --> 02:36:30,737
There it is.

2022
02:36:30,771 --> 02:36:33,366
Now all we have to do
is get inside.

2023
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,671
That's not going
to be so easy,

2024
02:36:34,711 --> 02:36:35,735
Lieutenant.

2025
02:36:35,778 --> 02:36:37,474
Well, someone's
got to do it.

2026
02:36:37,514 --> 02:36:39,039
All right, men, let's go.

2027
02:36:45,394 --> 02:36:47,829
Joliot, you and your men
guard the entrance.

2028
02:36:47,864 --> 02:36:50,561
The others, Gully, Herman,
come with me. Inside.

2029
02:36:50,601 --> 02:36:51,569
Do we shoot?

2030
02:36:51,603 --> 02:36:53,970
Why else are we here?
For a picnic?!

2031
02:37:08,827 --> 02:37:10,022
Back, everyone!

2032
02:37:10,063 --> 02:37:11,621
A grenade. Quick!

2033
02:37:18,076 --> 02:37:19,543
In the interest of saving lives

2034
02:37:19,577 --> 02:37:22,070
and after a token resistance
to preserve our honor,

2035
02:37:22,149 --> 02:37:23,616
I'll surrender the city.

2036
02:37:23,650 --> 02:37:26,586
I remain, Herr Consul Nordling,
gratefully yours...

2037
02:37:26,621 --> 02:37:28,487
And so on and so forth.

2038
02:37:28,524 --> 02:37:29,992
And see that
all this is packed.

2039
02:37:30,026 --> 02:37:31,927
We're about to be
prisoners of war.

2040
02:37:31,962 --> 02:37:33,088
That's if we're lucky.

2041
02:37:33,130 --> 02:37:34,758
That'll give me
a chance to read

2042
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,028
War and Peace at last.

2043
02:37:36,068 --> 02:37:38,902
Colonel, I would like
to thank you, too.

2044
02:37:38,939 --> 02:37:41,465
Get out, all of you, one by one,
with your hands up.

2045
02:37:41,509 --> 02:37:43,636
All of you,
take care of them.

2046
02:37:47,251 --> 02:37:50,085
Where's the General?

2047
02:37:55,764 --> 02:37:57,595
Herman.

2048
02:37:57,632 --> 02:37:58,600
So, Colonel,

2049
02:37:58,634 --> 02:37:59,999
where's the General?

2050
02:38:00,036 --> 02:38:01,026
Who? The General?

2051
02:38:01,071 --> 02:38:02,038
- Yes.
- He's upstairs.

2052
02:38:02,072 --> 02:38:03,040
Will he surrender?

2053
02:38:03,074 --> 02:38:04,041
He will surrender,

2054
02:38:04,075 --> 02:38:06,237
but only to an officer
of the regular army.

2055
02:38:06,278 --> 02:38:07,837
Show us the way.

2056
02:38:15,992 --> 02:38:17,427
They are here.

2057
02:38:40,362 --> 02:38:44,130
Lieutenant Henri Karcher,
army of General de Gaulle.

2058
02:38:44,201 --> 02:38:48,799
Lieutenant General von Choltitz,
Commander of Paris.

2059
02:38:50,945 --> 02:38:53,005
Are you willing to surrender?

2060
02:38:55,518 --> 02:38:56,486
Ja.

2061
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:57,953
Unconditionally?

2062
02:39:00,325 --> 02:39:02,089
Ja.

2063
02:39:02,195 --> 02:39:04,096
Then you are my prisoner.

2064
02:39:04,198 --> 02:39:05,928
Give us your arms.

2065
02:39:05,967 --> 02:39:08,960
Thank you, Lieutenant.

2066
02:39:09,004 --> 02:39:10,939
Major Larorie.

2067
02:39:10,974 --> 02:39:14,206
General von Choltitz,
you have engaged in battle,

2068
02:39:14,245 --> 02:39:15,577
you have lost.

2069
02:39:15,614 --> 02:39:16,979
In the name of General Bayet,

2070
02:39:17,015 --> 02:39:18,916
I ask you to give me
some of your officers

2071
02:39:18,952 --> 02:39:21,046
who will ride in Jeeps
carrying the white flag

2072
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:22,955
so we can convey
the order of surrender

2073
02:39:22,992 --> 02:39:24,391
to those still fighting.

2074
02:39:24,427 --> 02:39:27,090
There are already
too many killed and wounded.

2075
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:28,962
General, will you follow me?

2076
02:39:31,470 --> 02:39:33,462
Karcher, you're in charge
of the others.

2077
02:39:33,506 --> 02:39:34,701
Yes, sir.

2078
02:39:41,584 --> 02:39:44,419
The moment has come.

2079
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:02,312
Come on.

2080
02:40:20,909 --> 02:40:22,342
Where are you taking me?

2081
02:40:22,377 --> 02:40:24,346
You've surrendered
to the French army.

2082
02:40:24,380 --> 02:40:27,649
Now you're going to sign
the act of capitulation.

2083
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:55,818
Hello, Papa?

2084
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:58,194
This is Lieutenant Karcher.

2085
02:40:58,231 --> 02:40:59,722
Your son.

2086
02:40:59,767 --> 02:41:03,796
In spite of your pessimistic
view of my military career,

2087
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:06,036
I'd like to announce
that I've just made prisoners

2088
02:41:06,076 --> 02:41:07,566
of the general
in command of Paris

2089
02:41:07,611 --> 02:41:08,806
at the Hotel Meurice.

2090
02:41:08,847 --> 02:41:10,314
He surrendered to me.

2091
02:41:10,348 --> 02:41:13,786
But I'm still very bad at drill.

2092
02:41:15,055 --> 02:41:16,523
Go on! Go on!

2093
02:41:16,557 --> 02:41:17,956
Go on! Oh...

2094
02:41:36,187 --> 02:41:37,176
We made it.

2095
02:41:37,221 --> 02:41:38,416
We won the race.

2096
02:41:38,457 --> 02:41:39,755
Where are we?

2097
02:41:39,793 --> 02:41:41,818
In front of Notre Dame.

2098
02:41:41,861 --> 02:41:43,090
What's it look like?

2099
02:41:43,130 --> 02:41:45,656
Just like they said, big.

2100
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:49,604
And beautiful with...
two towers.
