00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:13,804
Maybe in June of 1954,

moved into the highlands of Vietnam

of war was coming its way.

over cavemen in black pyjamas.

of every woman in the tribe.

170
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:07,301
The Sioux raised their children that way.

171
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:13,060
Every warrior called every woman in the tribe
"Mother",

172
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:16,315
every older warrior they called "Grandfather".

173
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:20,198
The point here is they fought as a family.

174
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:23,901
Take care of your men.

175
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,236
Teach them to take care of each other...

176
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:33,043
'cause when this starts,
each other is all we're gonna have.

177
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,509
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.

178
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,885
That's fine. You're my radio operator.

179
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:47,973
- I...
- You'll be fine. You'll work it out.

180
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:58,568
Any of you sons-of-bitches
calls me Grandpa...

181
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,188
I'll kill you.

182
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,128
Godboldt, take your boots off.

183
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:30,723
Go on.

184
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:34,682
Everybody, take your boots off.

185
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,852
Everybody. Socks too.

186
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,075
I want you to draw fresh socks from supply

187
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,573
and keep your feet dusted with powder.

188
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:03,920
Everybody check each other's feet
like Godboldt and me.

189
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:09,175
- Now, that young man's a leader.
- Yes, sir.

190
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:14,422
But that other fella - that big strong one there.
He wants to win medals.

191
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,150
He's eager.

192
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,942
Ladies. I'm really glad you're here today.

193
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:36,620
I know that some of you are new to the Army
and all of us are new to this post,

194
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:41,200
so I thought we could pool our resources
and cover whatever questions we might have.

195
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,293
Why don't we start
with item number one - food?

196
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:48,460
If the commissary is out of something,
where's the best place to shop?

197
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:51,333
I tried Big Star and it's OK.

198
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,590
But I keep thinking my water's going to break
at the check-out aisle!

199
00:19:57,642 --> 00:20:01,805
That takes care of food shopping.
So item number two - laundry.

200
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:05,846
The washing machines don't work.
They're full of sand.

201
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,480
- I'll take care of that.
- I've complained.

202
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:11,771
Well, we'll just go to the General.

203
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:17,071
The laundromat in town's OK, but they
won't let you wash coloured things.

204
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:19,995
- In a public laundromat?
- It doesn't make sense,

205
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:23,413
but they have a sign in the window saying
"Whites Only".

206
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,330
- What?
- Honey, they mean white people only.

207
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:37,627
That's awful. Your husband is wearing
the uniform of a country that allows a place

208
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:43,261
to say that his laundry's not good enough,
when he could die for...

209
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,520
- I'm sorry. I...
- That's all right, honey.

210
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:54,477
I know what my husband's fighting for
and that's why I can smile.

211
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,062
My husband will never ask for respect,

212
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,609
and he'll give respect to no man
who hasn't earned it.

213
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:02,862
The rest of his family's the same way.

214
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:05,955
They can keep their goddamn
washing machine

215
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:08,828
because my baby's clothes are clean
anyway.

216
00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:13,797
Well, I guess that takes care
of item number two!

217
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:21,883
- Are you all right?
- I think my water just broke.

218
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:24,262
OK. OK. We're all calm.

219
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,434
We're all calm. A car!

- At ease. At ease.

I heard my new Lieutenant's
become a father. Congratulations.

223
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:11,767
- Thank you, sir.
- I didn't want to disturb you.

No, no, it's fine. It's all right. Please.

- How's your wife?
- She's OK. She's OK.

226
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,528
She's sleeping. So is my daughter.

227
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,315
I just wanted to be here for a while
before I held her.

228
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,157
- This her tag? What's this say?
- Oh, Camille. I'm sorry about this.

229
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:32,903
Don't you take that off. That's an order.

230
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:38,169
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.

231
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:44,373
What do you think
about being a soldier and a father?

232
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:49,592
I hope that being good at the one
makes me better at the other.

233
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:54,891
Why? What about you?

234
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:57,681
I don't know, sir.

235
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:02,981
Between college and here,
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.

236
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:08,275
We helped build a school for orphans.

237
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:14,902
They were orphans because the warlord
across the border didn't like their tribe.

238
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:21,168
I know God has a plan for me.

239
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:25,631
I just hope it's to help protect orphans...

240
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,459
not make any.

241
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,385
Well, why don't we ask him?

242
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,641
Come on, let's go ask him.

243
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:45,522
Our Father in Heaven,
before we go into battle,

244
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:49,144
every soldier among us will approach you
each in his own way.

245
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,399
Our enemies too,

246
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,787
according to their own understanding,
will ask for protection and for victory.

247
00:23:56,954 --> 00:24:02,458
And so we bow before your infinite wisdom.
We offer our prayers as best we can.

248
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,919
I pray you watch over the young men
like Jack Geoghegan

249
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:09,331
that I lead into battle.

250
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,720
You use me as your instrument
in this awful hell of war to watch over them.

251
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,640
Especially if they're men
like this one beside me,

252
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:22,059
deserving of a future in your blessing
and goodwill.

253
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:26,309
- Amen.
- Amen.

254
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,439
Oh! Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord.

255
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,313
About our enemies...

256
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:38,405
ignore their heathen prayers and help us
blow those bastards to hell.

And then soldiers like your daddy have to...
It's my job to go over there and stop them.

(WHISTLES BLOW)

506
01:00:55,666 --> 01:01:00,162
Crandall, this is Troajan Six. It's too hot
down here. I'm closing the LZ.

507
01:01:00,338 --> 01:01:03,541
- You copy that, Too Tall?
- Copy that, Snake.

508
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:06,670
All Seventh Cavalry units,
LZ X-Ray is closed.

509
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:11,471
- I don't li ke it. A whole battalion massacred.
- You think this is a massacre?

510
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:15,424
Losing a lot of draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.

511
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:17,262
Moore is still fighting.

512
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:20,723
He's against more men than he can count.
A platoon is lost.

513
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,103
They're not lost.
They're cut off and surrounded.

514
01:01:26,988 --> 01:01:28,898
Then they're lost.

515
01:01:29,074 --> 01:01:31,280
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

516
01:01:33,537 --> 01:01:36,905
We need to carve out an emergency LZ
right over there.

517
01:01:37,082 --> 01:01:38,908
- Sir.
- Blow the trees down.

518
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:50,382
Fire in the hole!

519
01:01:56,224 --> 01:01:58,383
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.

520
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:02,475
- We're coming in with two loads of ammo.
- We've blown a new LZ.

521
01:02:02,648 --> 01:02:05,138
Come in from the east. Out.

522
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:12,364
It's Brigade Headquarters, they want you out.

523
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:15,616
- We can't get out, damnit!
- Not all of us, just you.

524
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:17,943
Saigon wants to debrief you.

525
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:20,369
That doesn't make any sense.

526
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,947
Say again. Will you repeat that order?

527
01:02:28,256 --> 01:02:31,291
Too Tall, follow the Colonel to the new LZ.

528
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:33,590
I see him, Snake.

529
01:02:38,724 --> 01:02:41,262
Let's go! Move!

530
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:46,813
Shit!

531
01:02:46,982 --> 01:02:49,307
Come on, we'll give you a hand.

532
01:02:49,484 --> 01:02:53,398
All right, get that ammo off
and get the wounded on!

533
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:55,979
Bring them on. Get them on, boys.

534
01:03:02,705 --> 01:03:05,113
No, no! We're overloaded. Leave him.

535
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:08,625
No. I'll get out. It's Ray.
He's hurt worse than me.

536
01:03:10,004 --> 01:03:12,542
You hang on. I'll see you back there, Ray.

538
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,188
You, me and Oulette are all we have
in reserve.

539
01:03:40,366 --> 01:03:42,608
Yeah. We're slacking up a little.

540
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:45,620
No. We're just regrouping for another assault.

541
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:48,746
Distribute that ammo.

542
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,375
- Oulette!
- Sir.

543
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:53,793
Tell Crandall he's got time
for one more flight in here.

544
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,754
Agent Serpent, this is Trojan Six...

545
01:03:57,925 --> 01:04:00,498
Doc, get this water to the wounded.

546
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:05,513
Everybody's out of water.
It must be terrible for them.

547
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,805
And those guys are cut off out there.

548
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:19,523
- Running low on ammo, Sarge!
- Pick your target. One shot, one kill. OK?

549
01:04:19,695 --> 01:04:22,269
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How are we doing, Doc?

550
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:27,360
- Ernie, we're out of water.
- That's the last of it.

551
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:46,761
- My face is on fire!
- Phosphorus! Hold still! Hold still!

552
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,765
Don't touch your face. Hold still.

553

- Doc! Doc! It's phosphorus.
- OK.

Does anybody have any more bandages?!

01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,552
Ernie!

556
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,969
- Ernie, you hit too? You hit?
- No. I'm OK.

557
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,297
Our guys are gonna come for us?

558
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:38,848
- Yeah.
- When?

01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:42,564
Plug his wound.

560
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,237
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.

561
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:06,504
This is Too Tall. I'm clear.

562
01:06:06,674 --> 01:06:08,915
Crandall's clear.

563
01:06:14,431 --> 01:06:15,926
- Colonel.
- Geoghegan.

564
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,599
I want you to go and reinforce the company
on that ridge.

565
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,177
- Yes, sir!
- OK. Keep your head down.

566
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:26,891
To the top of the ridge! Move it!

567
01:06:40,122 --> 01:06:44,202
Captain Nadal? We've got to break through
to that cut-off platoon.

568
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:47,618
We got an American platoon out there.

569
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:51,081
We've got an Air Cav platoon cut off
out there!

570

Air Cav! Air Cav! Going over!

571
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,528
I said, "I know. Your mom asked me
to give you $600!"

572

Good luck to you.

573
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:31,912
- You got enough room for one more?
- If you're crazy enough, get in.

574
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,998
Yes, sir.

575
01:07:49,939 --> 01:07:52,512
Hey, what are those lights down there?

576
01:07:52,692 --> 01:07:57,437
Enemy soldiers.
They use candles on the trail.

577
01:07:57,613 --> 01:08:00,898
They're moving into position to attack.

today, Snake.

but you need us, you call us.

We're greatly outnumbered.

- Yes, sir.

- Crandall! You led my men into a hot LZ.
- Somebody had to fly out the wounded.

more telegrams tomorrow?

673

674

and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

Lord, hear my voice.

676

Let thy voice be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.

677
01:21:19,466 --> 01:21:22,503
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our iniquities.

678
01:21:23,387 --> 01:21:25,628
Lord, who can abide them?

679
01:21:29,058 --> 01:21:31,384
With thee there is mercy.

680
01:21:33,312 --> 01:21:38,270
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord,
and may perpetual light shine among them.

681

Through the mercy of God,
may they rest in peace. Amen.

You got the guts for it.

687

My daddy was a soldier. My grand-daddy.

688
01:22:23,528 --> 01:22:28,190
Two of my great grand-daddies were soldiers.
Hell, that's how I came to be.

689
01:22:28,366 --> 01:22:31,532
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.

690
01:22:31,702 --> 01:22:37,242
My great grand-daddy Galloway lost his left
and my great grand-daddy Reid lost his right.

691
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:41,034
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.

692
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:45,046
Every year after that, the same date,
the same store,

693
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:48,382
they'd get together
and pick out a new pair of shoes.

694
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:52,086
- You are shitting me?
- No, sir. I swear to God.

695
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:56,765
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son -
my grandparents.

696
01:22:56,935 --> 01:23:00,599
What the hell were the odds of them
having the same shoe size?

697
01:23:02,732 --> 01:23:05,852
I don't know, Colonel.
It was meant to be, I guess.

698
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:09,526
Yeah. Meant to be.

699
01:23:11,949 --> 01:23:15,698
Galloways have been in every war
this country has ever fought.

700
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:19,998
But when it came to this one,
I didn't think I could stop the war.

701
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:23,499
I just thought maybe I might try
and understand one.

702
01:23:25,129 --> 01:23:28,295
Maybe help the folks back home understand.

703
01:23:30,884 --> 01:23:36,554
I just figured I could do that better
shooting a camera than shooting a rifle.

704
01:23:39,183 --> 01:23:40,594

705

01:46:33,127 --> 01:46:37,207
Now, I will not leave my men.
Is that clear? Out.

841
01:46:45,472 --> 01:46:50,929
There's two of my men unaccounted for
and I figure they'll be out there some place.

842
01:46:51,103 --> 01:46:54,187
- Let's get 'em. What do you say?
- I'm with you, sir.

843
01:46:54,356 --> 01:46:56,514
All right. Let's go.

They...

847
01:48:52,219 --> 01:48:53,962
brought another.

848
01:48:54,137 --> 01:48:57,552
- Oh, God, Julie. It's yours.
- No.

He died keeping my promise.

850
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:20,751
Sir, they're ordering us all out. All of us.

851
01:50:22,013 --> 01:50:24,255
They're going to march reinforcements in.

852
01:50:24,432 --> 01:50:29,177
They don't understand a damn thing,
do they? We can't get out.

853
01:50:31,898 --> 01:50:34,815
He's waiting in a cave
and that's what he wants.

854
01:50:34,984 --> 01:50:39,195
The moment he sees live soldiers
on the helicopter, he'll be all over us.

855
01:50:39,363 --> 01:50:41,605
Then he'll get his massacre.

Carry on, sir.

859
01:51:27,076 --> 01:51:33,824
I wonder what was in Custer's mind when
he realised he'd led his men into a slaughter.

860
01:51:34,374 --> 01:51:37,126
Sir, Custer was a pussy.

Right now they're planning their final attack -
the one that's going to finish us off.

865
01:52:01,066 --> 01:52:06,523
They'll nibble at us all night, then come dawn,
they'll hit us with everything they've got.
