Why impossible?

532
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,399
Much as he loves Your Majesty,
the king cannot agree to betroth

533
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,900
his beloved son to a--

534
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,719
To a bride whose legitimacy
is not accepted

535
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,220
by His Holiness Pope Paul.

536
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,940
By Holy Church itself.

537
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,620
Nor even by the emperor.

538
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,580
However, His Majesty,

539
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,920
to demonstrate his love,
proposes another match.

540
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,799
He would consent to the betrothal
of the dauphin to Lady Mary,

541
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,239
your legitimate daughter.

542
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,740
[###]

543
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,919
If you do not agree to the match,

544
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,759
my master will marry his son
to the emperor's daughter,

545
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,390
Ieaving your country
isolated in Europe.

546
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,500
Excellence, your audience
with His Majesty is now over.

547
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,719
I'm sorry.

548
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,639
[###]

549
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,260
I have no excuses, Catherine.

550
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,800
I thought those days
were behind me.

551
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,630
Perhaps human nature
can never change.

552
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,559
I swear to you
it will never happen again.

553
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,839
I love you too much.

554
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,750
I have no right to ask you
to believe me.

555
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,380
But it's true.

556
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,599
You see?

557
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,400
You did make me cry after all.

558
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,239
Who was she?

559
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,399
Who was who?

560
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,959
That lady you were talking to

561
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,879
when you were supposed
to be finding Monsieur Gontier.

562
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,380
[SlGHS]

563
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,790
I don't know.
Is she one of your mistresses?

564
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,140
How many do you have?

565
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,420
What are their names?

566
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,630
Where do you keep them? Hmm?

567
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,839
Someone told me your nobles,
like Brandon,

568
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,239
are assisting you
in having your affairs.

569
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,740
That's enough.

570
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,380
No.

571
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,599
No, you told me.

572
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,319
You always told me that we should
be truthful with each other.

573
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,639
You said it was
the definition of love.

574
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,959
Then here's the truth.

575
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,119
You must shut your eyes
and endure.

576
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,839
Like your betters have done
before you.

577
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,593
How can you say that to me?

578
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,639
Don't you know I love you a thousand
times more than Catherine ever did?

579
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,719
And don't you know that I can drag
you down as quickly as I raised you?

580
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,199
'Tis lucky you have your bed
already, madam.

581
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,540
Because if you did not,
I would not give it to you again.

582
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,359
Francis won't accept the betrothal.

583
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,860
Why?
Why do you think?

584
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,471
Because the pope and he
and the emperor all agree

585
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,399
she is a bastard.

586
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,198
And you are not my wife.

587
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,740
[###]

588
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,960
HENRY:
Tell me, how's your Catherine?

589
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,700
She's fine.

590
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,520
In fact, she's with child.
Ah.

591
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,310
You're a happily married man,
Charles. I envy you.

592
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,119
Do you think the planets
have any influence over our lives?

593
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,620
I don't know.

594
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,999
I would often discuss the issue
with More.

595
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,559
We would stand on the roof
at night

596
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,060
and study the heavens.

597
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,399
More had a great knowledge
of the stars

598
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,020
and how they influence our...

599
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,719
humours.

600
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,220
[###]

601
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,600
I regret now
what happened to More.

602
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,170
In some ways,
I wish it never happened.

603
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,200
But it wasn't all my fault.

604
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,352
Whenever my resolve weakened,

605
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,360
whenever I was inclined
to save him,

606
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:36,560
a certain person would privately
urge me on to his destruction.

607
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,740
Who?

608
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,313
You know who she is, Charles.

609
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,700
