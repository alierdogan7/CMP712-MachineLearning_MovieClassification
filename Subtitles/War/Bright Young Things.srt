1
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,913
Nina!

2
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Miles!

3
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,243
Adam not back yet?
What?

4
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,427
Adam! Not back yet?
Any day now!

5
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,566
Isn't this  too dull?
I've never been more bored in my life!

6
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,250
Drink?
I'd kill for a martini.

7
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:44,404
Spot of absinth?
Yes, at least a spot.

8
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:14,217
I know you, don't I?
Lord Balcairn, how are you?

9
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:16,353
Very well. I know you,
but I don't know you.

10
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:20,365
Simon! It's been the longest age.
Business or pleasure?

11
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,459
Business of pleasure.
Adam not back yet?

12
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,625
Any day, poor lamb.
I'll just...

13
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,814
Who's your ferrety friend?
Lord knows!

14
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:31,560
What a foul party, though, eh?
Isn't it?

15
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,145
I was just saying to Miles
I don't think I've ever been

16
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,472
so frantically bored in my life!

17
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:37,407
Miles's here?
He's supposed to be fetching me a drink.

18
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,859
Now, dear, he really should be
more discreet.

19
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,802
I've just remembered where I've seen
that man before. He's a bloody photo rat.

20
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,268
Let's get him!

21
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,268
A rat! A rat! Let's get him!
A bloody photo rat!

22
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:51,927
Keep your hand still.
Not too hard. Not too hard!

23
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:53,273
Justy, you're such a coward!

24
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,566
I don't feel so well. I think I'm...

25
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,080
Oh, you're disgusting!

26
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,743
Madames et monsieurs, bienvenues
au le Port du Dover!

27
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:45,282
Did you see that steward?
He was winking at me.

28
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:46,798
He was not!

29
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:51,985
Cassidy! Piony! Endeavour! This minute!
Yes Mrs Ape.

30
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,548
Come on, come on!

31
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:00,952
Is that your case, sir?

32
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:04,653
Just some very old clothes
and some books.

33
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:08,805
Books, eh?
What sort of books, may I ask?

34
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,594
Fortitude, I forbid you to bounce!

35
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,395
He's against books,
the Home Secretary is.

36
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:20,299
If we can't stamp out literature
in our own country,

37
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,436
we can at least stop its being brought in.

38
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:23,812
Hello, hello!

39
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,354
What's this?
That's a book, too.

40
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,872
The one I've just written.

41
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,430
You're name's Sue, is it?
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!

42
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:33,431
That's a pseudonim.

43
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,986
Sue De Nimes.
I can read, thank you very much.

44
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:39,680
No, you don't understand. It's sort of
a joke. Sue De Nimes - pseudonim.

45
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,186
Nome de plume.

46
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,202
What's this?

47
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:45,125
Vomit.

48
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,091
There was an accident.

49
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,034
You come along with me. Briggs!
Sir.

50
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:52,639
I really must catch the train.

51
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:56,389
There are worse things than
missing trains, young Susie.

52
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:05,041
You hideous beasts!
You ghastly savages!

53
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:08,343
Book, sir.
Goes by the name of Susie.

54
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,583
Well, now, what's this about books?
They're just books.

55
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:15,215
I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

56
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:18,754
Oh, Adam, darling!
Hello, Agatha.

57
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:20,301
I never saw you on the boat.

58
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,434
I can't even tell you the things that
have been happening to me in there.

59
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,249
The way they looked.
Too, too shaming.

60
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,992
Positively surgical, my dear.
And such wicked old women!

61
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,386
I shall ring up every cabinet minister
and all the newspapers

62
00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:34,540
and give them the most
shy making details.

63
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,386
Let's find the train.
No, I've got troubles of my own.

64
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:40,827
Well, now, you can take these books.
And the dictionary.

65
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:45,264
Minus this page,
thank you very much.

66
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:50,462
But this Bright young things, that's just
downright dirt and is marked for burning.

67
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:53,340
What? There isn't a word in the book...
You must be misinterpreting...

68
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:56,461
I know dirt when I see it.
Or I shouldn't be where I am today.

69
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,228
Do you realise that my whole livelihood
depends on that book?

70
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,289
I've already been paid for it.

71
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,012
And my livelihood depends on keeping
filth like that out of the country.

72
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,395
Archie Shwert is giving a lovely
party tonight

73
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,699
so we simply must catch the next train
or I shan't have the chance to dress

74
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,887
Archie who?

75
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:15,533
Oh, you poor things! Have you've
been waiting here all this time?

76
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:20,611
I don't know what Lord Monomark
is gonna say.

77
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:23,415
Suppose he'll want his money back.

78
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,000
The press is getting altogether
too bothersome.

79
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,135
Except when they aren't.

80
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:30,738
Now, you won't forget to come
to Archie Shwert's party?

81
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,524
Well, I've got to get to my hotel...

82
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,750
You're not still staying at Shepherd's,
are you, darling?

83
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:40,915
So many little people...
What can they all do with their lives?

84
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,319
When are you and Nina going to
get married?

85
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,391
I have just the trousers to wear,
only you won't do it.

86
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,744
Well, I'm not sure we'd be able to.
Just here will be fine. Thank you, driver.

87
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:52,992
Darling, if you don't marry her soon,
someone else will, and that will never do.

88
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,965
Take the lady out to Berkley Street and
drop my luggage off at Shepherd's hotel,

89
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,551
St. James'.
Right, sir.

90
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,175
Bye, darling. See you at Archie's.

91
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:07,466
Wild scenes at the party!
Shocking pictures!

92
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:11,009
Shocking pictures!
Great Mr. Chatterbox!

93
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,067
Great Mr Chatterbox!
Chatterbox kills all!

94
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,100
Shocking pictures!
Shocking pictures!

95
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,697
London, Adam, there is no place
like it on God's green earth.

96
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,781
Yep, quite a city.

97
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,144
For the first twenty years of my life
the biggest town I ever saw

98
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,786
or hoped to see was Nassacity, Manitoba.
Population:1.230 souls.

99
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:39,868
Now, here I am, prince of the greatest
metropolis the world has ever known.

100
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,634
Gives a man a think, wouldn't you say?
Certainly.

101
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,024
Certainly...

102
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,956
You're right there, Adam.
Certainly.

103
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:53,389
Now, I believe you owe me a book.
A little late in delivery?

104
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,720
Ah, well now, the customs
confiscated it.

105
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,725
Now, see here, you owe me
one hundred pounds or one book.

106
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,060
Well, I suppose I could write it again.

107
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,133
Was it good?
Well, you know...

108
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:08,518
Don't ever believe English modesty is
charming. It's irritating, it's what it is.

109
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,630
It was exceptionally good.

110
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:14,195
What is it with you people?
I have plenty of you working for me.

111
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:18,238
Lord Balcairn, a genuine earl,
does my gossip for me

112
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,239
under the name Mr. Chatterbox.
Did you know that?

113
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,732
Yes, I did know.
A friend of yours, I suppose.

114
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,556
Bright young things,
that was the title, right?

115
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,640
Tearing the lid of the young,
idle and rich?

116
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:30,804
My readers can't get enough
of that kind of thing, Mr Symes.

117
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,649
I put Signor Mussolini on the front
page, nobody buys a copy.

118
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,669
Put a picture of one of your set in a night
club and can't print enough copies.

119
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:41,181
Are you a butterfly or a bee?
Excuse me?

120
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:42,858
Do you wanna flirt around,
looking pretty, doing nothing

121
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,791
or do you wanna make honey?
I can't figure you out.

122
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,793
Your father worked for a living.
Greek professor, wasn't he?

123
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,338
Well, professor of Greek,
rather than a Greek professor.

124
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,035
Never get cute with someone
you owe money to.

125
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:55,618
What do you wanna do with your life?

126
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:00,069
Win the Nobel prize? Raise children?
Smoke a pipe?

127
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,113
Climb mountains? Fly airplanes? Find
a cure to influenza? Govern India?

128
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,877
Hell, God gave you two legs
and an immortal soul

129
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,621
in the capital city of the largest
empire the world has ever seen!

130
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,372
Are you gonna spend it eating
plover's eggs and sucking up cocktails?

131
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,521
Miss Blount's residence.

132
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:33,293
Hello?
May I speak to Miss Blount, please?

133
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,326
I'll just see if she's in.
Who's speaking, please?

134
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:37,544
Adam Symes.

135
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,026
Oh, Adam...
How are you, Nina?

136
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:43,739
Well I've got rather a pain,
just at present then.

137
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,654
Oh, Nina... Why were you
putting on a voice?

138
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,498
Thought you might be Madame Durrock.
I owe her for some hats.

139
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,861
Welcome home, my darling,
where are you?

140
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,734
Fleet Street. Darling, there was rather
a disaster at customs.

141
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,980
Yes, I know, Agatha called me.
She said they simply stripped her.

142
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,796
No, no, not that.
Something awful happened to me.

143
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,900
You too?
Were they horribly intimate?

144
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,933
Let's meet at Archie Shwert's party
and you can tell me all about it.

145
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,330
Who is this Archie Shwert?

146
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:09,462
Oh, someone new. Rather vulgar,
but very rich.

147
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,687
If you are coming, don't dress up,
no one will.

148
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,131
Except Archie, which is always
too funny.

149
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,768
Nina, I don't know
how to say this, but...

150
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,612
I don't think I shall be able
to marry you after all.

151
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,293
Oh... Adam, you are a bore.
Why not?

152
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,706
They confiscated my book.
Beasts! Who did?

153
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,829
I'll tell you about it tonight.
Yes, do. Goodbye, darling.

154
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,246
Goodbye, my sweet.

155
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,533
Shepherd's hotel, St. James', please.

156
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,423
Actually, I think I'll walk.

157
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,857
Tighten the try through, fairy princess.

158
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:04,392
And don't let me catch you wearing
that scent again!

159
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,532
Well, you are a stranger.
Hello, Lottie.

160
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,067
Welcome back.
How's your father?

161
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:13,610
Dead?
Oy, fella'!

162
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:16,215
Mr. Fenwick-Symes' post,
if you please.

163
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,989
I don't know, I should
let her go, really.

164
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,253
She's wearing Nuit de Noel,
would you believe.

165
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,736
Thank you, Basilio.
Is pleasure.

166
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,526
We'd given you up for dead, dear?
How was Monte Carlo?

167
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:29,034
Cannes.
Same thing.

168
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:30,441
We kept your room for you.

169
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,268
I expect you're ready
to pay your little bill now?

170
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,306
Well, as a matter of fact...
Come on in.

171
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:35,163
We were just thinking about having
a little drink.

172
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:43,575
Now, let me introduce you.
That's Mr What's-his-name.

173
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,497
And over there in the corner
That's the Major.

174
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:50,718
And that's an American judge
and there's the king of Pomoralia.

175
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:55,696
Anatolia, actually.
But, alas, no longer.

176
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:59,517
Poor chap, it's a shame.
They gave him the boot after the war.

177
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:03,857
Hasn't got a penny.
It's true, they steal my throne.

178
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,022
There now...

179
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:09,336
My godfather, the good archduke of
Austria, gave me one time

180
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:16,530
gold fountain pen with eagles on him.
I loved well my gold fountain pen

181
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:22,311
and then there was liberal minister,
one man of exceeding evilness.

182
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,025
He come to talk with me and thump!

183
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:31,513
Talk too much about some things
I not understand and when he gone...

184
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:36,504
Where was my gold fountain
pen with eagles on him?

185
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,488
Gone also!

186
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:43,165
Damn shame, sire.
A damn shame.

187
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,487
There now...
How about a drink?

188
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,237
Here...
Bet you can't do this.

189
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,190
Four coins.
One in each corner.

190
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,196
Two there.
Two there.

191
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,341
Two there.
Two there.

192
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:00,759
Two there. Oh, three there!
Oh, four!

193
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,314
Four coins, all in a corner.
There you are.

194
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:05,659
I'll do it again if you like.
Who's a clever boy?

195
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,001
Where did they teach you that then?
Chap on a train showed me.

196
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,340
It didn't look very hard.
Just you try.

197
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:13,004
Bet anything you like you can't do it.
How much will you bet?

198
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,379
Anything you like.
Five hundred pounds?

199
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,819
Go on, you do it.
He's got lots of money.

200
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,789
All right.

201
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,208
Two there.
Two there.

202
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,010
Two there.
Three there.

203
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:40,933
Four there.
There.

204
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:45,094
I'll be jiggered. Never seen anyone
do it like that before.

205
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,958
I've won a lot of money this week
with that trick.

206
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,160
Here you are.

207
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:55,268
Well, there's a thing. I'll expect you'll
like to buy everyone a drink now.

208
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,116
Certainly.

209
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:59,059
Toss you for it. Double or quits.
Best of three.

210
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:02,852
Very well.

211
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:05,595
Heads.

212
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:08,170
It is.

213
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:10,854
Call again.
Heads.

214
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,838
Well, I'm jiggered.
You are a lucky chap.

215
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:21,985
Hello?
Nina, it's Adam.

216
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:24,629
Darling, it's all right about
our getting married.

217
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,236
I've got a thousand pounds.

218
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:29,001
But, angel, how?
I'll tell you about it when we meet.

219
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,555
What would you all do if
you had a thousand pounds?

220
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:43,003
Me, I would buy me one gold pen.
With eagles on him.

221
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:46,157
I know what I'd do.
I'd put it on a horse.

222
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:47,745
What horse?

223
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,681
I'd tell you unlikely outside of a
November Handicap.

224
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:55,774
Indian Runner has a 20:1 in odds
of lengthen.

225
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:00,395
If you put a thousand pounds on it
to win and it did,

226
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,858
you'd be rich, wouldn't you?

227
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:05,901
Yes, so I would.

228
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:07,767
Well, give me the thousand
and I'll fix it.

229
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:13,744
All right.

230
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,129
Why not?
Sound investment.

231
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,636
Have a drink.
By all means.

232
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,286
Darling, I've got a very important
question to ask.

233
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,854
Do you know of a horse
called Indian Runner?

234
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:25,657
Oh, quite the worst sort of horse.
Mary and Miles' mother owns it.

235
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,911
It's not likely to win the November handicap?

236
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:29,947
Quite sure that's a no.

237
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,832
Why?
Oh, bother it, Nina!

238
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,593
I don't think I shall be able
to marry you after all.

239
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,761
You see, I put that thousand pounds
on Indian Runner to win.

240
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:39,472
Well, that was  silly.
Can't you get it back?

241
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,256
That's a good point.
I'll see.

242
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:46,992
I didn't hear the dinner gong at all.
Where's that fairy princess?

243
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,124
Lottie, where's the major?
What major?

244
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,639
I never saw a major.
The one you introduced me to.

245
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,243
How did you know he was a major?
You said he was.

246
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:59,666
Dear child, I've never seen him
before in my life.

247
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,823
We must all go up to dinner.
I shall go up with you, king.

248
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,809
I'm not feeling very hungry,
to be honest.

249
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:10,839
In fact, I'm feeling a little...
You hurry through to the gentlemen's!

250
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,563
The last man to be sick on that carpet
was king Edward VII

251
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:15,250
and he ate before, I can tell you.

252
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:30,491
By the way, why didn't you tell me
it was fancy dress-up?

253
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,213
I feel such a prune.
I forgot.

254
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,478
No, you didn't.

255
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:40,959
My dear!
Oh, look, Agatha!

256
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:43,094
Usually worth a couple of paragraphs,

257
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,438
but my editor's got her on the front page
tomorrow, anyway.

258
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,439
Customs nonsense.

259
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,401
And Adam's back.
Not that he's worth a mention.

260
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:53,512
Look, there's Simon and Van.
Writing about us, I bet.

261
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,819
Hope they write something nice.

262
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:01,118
You know Van described me as England's
premiere party animal last week honestly?

263
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,424
There! That's Adam Symes.

264
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,888
He looks so dashing.
Everyone looks dashing, don't they?

265
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:07,934
Dashing is the new thing.

266
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:10,380
Oh I wish I was as sophisticated
as Agatha Ransable.

267
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,963
You know it takes a little titanium on
the cheek and a little less eyebrow.

268
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,764
I can pluck them for you if you like.
Really?

269
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:18,861
Really really?
Oh, would you?

270
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:21,192
Can't believe I let them drag me
from the customs like that.

271
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,890
Now, I've got Lottie's bill to pay
and we can't get married.

272
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,053
There's always my papa. I believe
he's much richer than he looks.

273
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:30,257
I'll ask him to give us some money.
You must be Adam?

274
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:32,633
Archie Shwert.

275
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,426
Such a wonderous party, Archie.
Why, aren't you clever!

276
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,540
You should certainly win the
costume prize.

277
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,122
Adam, you hideous ass, that's how
Archie always dresses at parties.

278
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:51,921
Orchid. Stop. New paragraph.
Simon. Coma. The Earl Balcairn. Coma.

279
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:55,542
Dressed as the most unconvincing
Duke of Wellington.

280
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,867
As in boots, yes.

281
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:03,354
Yes. Might be worth sending
a few photographers over.

282
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,504
How, too dreary, they're like
flies, aren't they?

283
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:08,762
I think they're after Agatha.

284
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:11,364
You know, her father made the most
crashing speech about customs officers

285
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:12,751
in the House of Lords this evening.

286
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,647
Several bishops burst into tears,
apparently.

287
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:16,472
That dreadful Simon Balcairn!

288
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,227
I certainly tipped him off.
Where are we going?

289
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,942
Half past three.
Lottie will be closing now.

290
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,416
How about the Ritz?
Oh talk sense, dear.

291
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,844
It's not while I'm dressed
like this.

292
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:28,256
I'd say my house, only I've lost my
key. It's just too bogus of me.

293
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:29,957
Why don't we all go on to my house?

294
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,891
So that's agreed then. You can go
up to Dowting tomorrow

295
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:39,527
and I'll wire daddy and tell him
you're coming.

296
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,225
Will he like me, do you think?

297
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:44,387
Well, how couldn't he with you being
so sweet and everything?

298
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:46,224
Why can't you come, too?

299
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,479
I already told you I have a pain.

300
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:53,738
Bacon and eggs, everybody!
Champagne!

301
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:56,790
Had to be the oddest house.
Do you think there are any glasses?

302
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,752
I just don't know where daddy
keeps them.

303
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,213
Such a bore, darling.
So sorry, darling.

304
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:07,611
Well, it is rather ferous drinking from
decanters, after all.

305
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,152
What strange ancesters you have,
Jane. All so serious-looking.

306
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:17,360
It's as if they're gazing into my soul
and finding something rather horrid.

307
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,536
Well, they probably are.

308
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,320
I say, Mary, what do you know of
your mother's horse Indian Runner?

309
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:26,282
Oh, Adam, don't even think about
it. Mommy says he's a donkey.

310
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:29,521
Do you know Jane Brown?
How do you do, Miss Brown?

311
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:31,091
So sweet of you to have us all round.

312
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:36,305
Oh, no, such a pleasure.
I often...

313
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,910
Do have some bacon.
Thank you.

314
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:43,845
I say, Jane, it will be all right me
staying here tonight, won't it?

315
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:46,527
You be my latchkey.
It'll be fine, Agatha darling.

316
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:48,643
Quite fine.

317
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:50,159
Do you have a piaano, dear?

318
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,622
I have a strange longing to play
something crimson and obscene

319
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:57,184
by Bissoni.
Or a rague. Do let's have a rague!

320
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm not sure.

321
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:01,754
My father's asleep upstairs.
He might...

322
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,747
Oh... How boring.

323
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:05,895
I saw some creme de menthe
in the kitchen.

324
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:09,266
What good's creme de menthe, child,
when I wanted a piano?

325
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,968
Only, the piano's on the first floor...

326
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,973
I don't suppose anyone has
some naughty salt?

327
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,451
We must go.
There might be some in the kitchen.

328
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:18,843
But the bacon's...
No, dear, naughty salt!

329
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,066
Mother might just have some
in her compact.

330
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,095
Miles is being beastly in upsetting
poor Jane.

331
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,866
Besides, you've got to look all pretty
and frisky for my papa.

332
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:51,488
And how was Mr Shwert's dance, Jane?
Did you have a good time?

333
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:54,352
It was just too divine!

334
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:58,375
It was what, Jane?

335
00:22:59,262 --> 00:23:02,178
I mean...
It was lovely, mama.

336
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:06,566
I say, mama...
I asked a girl to stay the night.

337
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:09,131
What an extraordinary thing to do!

338
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,015
Did she accept?
Yes!

339
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,071
She's here now.

340
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:17,013
Morning, all!
The right room at last!

341
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:18,989
Do you know I popped in to a
study or something?

342
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,441
There was a sweet old boy
sitting at a desk.

343
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,043
He did look surprised to see me.
Was it your papa?

344
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:26,518
And this is mama.

345
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:31,357
How are you? I say, I think it's simply
too sweet of you to let me come down

346
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:34,321
to breakfast like this. Are you sure
you're not furious with me?

347
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,942
All of this is really much more
embarrassing for me, isn't it?

348
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:41,168
Don't you think?
Or don't you?

349
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,503
Would you like to help yourself?

350
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:51,697
Martha! The most extraordinary
thing!

351
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:55,410
Must be losing my reason. I was
in my study just now...

352
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:58,921
Just going over my speech and then
suddenly the door opened

353
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,162
and in came some sort of
dancing hottentot woman.

354
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:07,141
And it just said: "Ew, how shy making!"
and then disappeared and I turned...

355
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:10,369
Oh...

356
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:12,165
How do you do?

357
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:15,956
And this is my husband.
I don't think you've met before.

358
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:17,702
Only for a second

359
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:22,681
Martha never told us we were
having guests.

360
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,299
Forgive me if I appeared a little
inhospitable.

361
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:32,997
Why doesn't somebody say
something?

362
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:37,444
Oh, look Monocle!
Jimmy Vanburgh's column!

363
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:41,666
Who's got the front page?
Midnight orgies at No. 10, it says.

364
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,814
What a scream!

365
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,926
Shall I read it to you?

366
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,291
At about 4 A.M. the policeman
posted outside the Prime Minister's

367
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,215
residence was surprised to witness...
Isn't this too amusing?

368
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:58,145
the arrival in Downing Street of a
fleet of taxis from which emerged

369
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,471
a gay throng in exotic fancy dress.

370
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,778
How I should have loved to
have seen it! Can you imagine?

371
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:06,398
The amongstly present was the
honurable Agatha Rans...

372
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,233
Oh, that's me...

373
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:09,990
What an extraordinary thing!

374
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:16,076
Oh...

375
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:19,927
Oh, my God...
Begging your pardon, sir James...

376
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:23,529
Mrs Proudford wants to know
why there is talcum powder

377
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,808
on the table in the cabinet room.
Talcum powder? In the cabinet room?

378
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:31,950
It looks like talcum powder
but it doesn't smell of it, sir.

379
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:35,346
Mrs Proudford was wondering
if it might be anarchist gunpowder

380
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:37,072
and should we send for the army?

381
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,986
Oh, dear, this is really
all too shaffling. I think, perhaps...

382
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:43,016
Don't see me out. I shall write
the tenderest thank you letter,

383
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:44,394
I promise.

384
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:54,971
Disgusting!
Absolutely disgusting!

385
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,332
They need a good bloody war,
if you ask me.

386
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,615
Excuse me?
That lot.

387
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:05,058
Jiggeding and jazzing about
like Mexican beans.

388
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:08,969
A sound of guns and
a smell of gas.

389
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:11,342
That would soon stop all that.

390
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,282
Disgusting!
I should imagine it is.

391
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:17,349
What?

392
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,392
The sound of guns and the smell of gas.
I should imagine it is disgusting.

393
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:24,246
No. Them!
Ah!

394
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:27,643
Parasites!
Is Dowting much further?

395
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:29,494
About half a mile.

396
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:46,441
Chitty and oil fifteen bob.

397
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:10,260
Don't ring twice!

398
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:14,620
What do you want?
Good afternoon. Is Mr Blount home?

399
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:18,094
There's no Mr Blount here.
This is colonel Blount's house.

400
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,035
I'm sorry, I think the colonel is
expecting me to lunch.

401
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:23,369
Nonsense! I'm colonel Blount.

402
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:38,496
Yes?

403
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:41,648
Would you mind awfully if I just
telephoned the station for a taxi cab?

404
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,717
I'm not on the telephone.

405
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,157
Why don't you come in? It's absurd
to walk to the station in this.

406
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:50,641
Fifteen miles, for God's sake!
Are you mad?

407
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:54,721
Come about the vacuum cleaner,
have you?

408
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:56,717
No.

409
00:27:56,718 --> 00:28:00,879
Hang your hat and coat here.
I hope you haven't got wet.

410
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:04,489
Shame you didn't bring
your vacuum cleaner.

411
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:08,300
Can't be helped.
How are you?

412
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:15,220
Do sit down. I must read this cable. I've
quite forgotten, it came this morning.

413
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:17,634
Oh, dear.

414
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:21,410
Don't think me discourteous but I'm
affraid it's impossible for me

415
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,391
to ask you to luncheon. I've a guest
coming on intimate family business.

416
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:29,703
It's some young rascal who
wants to marry my daughter.

417
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:34,164
Well, I want to marry your daughter, too.
What an extraordinary thing.

418
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,558
Are you sure?

419
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,663
Perhaps the telegram is about me.
What does it say?

420
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:45,051
Engaged to marry Adam Symes.
Expect luncheon. Nina.

421
00:28:45,052 --> 00:28:46,987
Are you Adam Symes?
Yes.

422
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:48,204
But why didn't say so before?

423
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:50,410
Instead of going on about vacuum cleaners.

424
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:51,468
How are you?

425
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:56,316
Mrs Florid, lay a plate for Mr...
Symes.

426
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,313
Symes!

427
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:03,631
Better give him his own decanter, Mrs F.
Coffee pot up and down all the time.

428
00:29:05,797 --> 00:29:08,660
So you're the young fool who's
gonna marry my daughter?

429
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:11,893
I very much hope so, sir.
How much money have you got?

430
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:15,595
Well, had a thousand pounds last night.

431
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:19,008
I gave it all to a drunken major.
Why did you do that for?

432
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:22,060
Well, I hoped he would put it on
Indian Runner.

433
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,274
November handicap.
Never heard of the animal.

434
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,540
When will you next have some money?

435
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,861
When I've written some books.
You see, I owe Lord Monomark.

436
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:33,046
For an advance and untill
I get it written I rather hoped...

437
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,551
Well, we rather hoped
that you might help us.

438
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:38,085
How can I help you? I've never
written a book in my life!

439
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:41,207
No, we...
Wrote a letter to the Times once.

440
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:45,290
Never published.
We thought that...

441
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:47,325
Well that you might give us
some money.

442
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,301
You thought that, did you?

443
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,431
I think that is an admirable idea.

444
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:56,415
I don't see any reason why I shouldn't.

445
00:29:57,354 --> 00:30:00,076
How much do you want?
Well, you know...

446
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:02,411
Would a thousand pounds be any help?

447
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:05,673
Yes, it would. Indeed.

448
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:08,942
We'd both be terribly grateful.
Not at all, my dear boy.

449
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:11,626
What was your name again?
Adam Symes.

450
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:15,958
Fenwick-Symes.
Knew a Fenwick-Symes at Oxford.

451
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:18,570
My father.

452
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:21,832
He wasted all his money on horses, too.
Or was it women?

453
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,277
No!
Books!

454
00:30:29,936 --> 00:30:30,793
Nina!

455
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:57,016
Nina!

456
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:06,274
Darling?

457
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,556
Why are you dancing like that?
Nina, I'm so excited!

458
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:13,224
Why, what's happened?
Everything! I'll tell you in the car.

459
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,014
Lottie at the hotel has lent me some
money, so I've hired a car.

460
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,891
What have you done, darling?
Do stop dancing about!

461
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,895
I can't stop.
Adam, sit tight.

462
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:22,270
Look out of the window and see if you
can see a limousin waiting.

463
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,621
I don't know what you have been up to
and I will be told!

464
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,498
My dear, a thousand pounds!

465
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:36,191
Did my papa give you that?
Darling, I'm not dressed for dinner.

466
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:42,317
I'll look after this cheque. Poor Adam.
Why do you say that?

467
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,754
I don't know. I say, what a grand car!
Nina, why did you say poor Adam?

468
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:46,751
I dont know.

469
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:51,660
Where to, sir?

470
00:31:57,656 --> 00:31:58,576
I don't know. Um...

471
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:00,108
Chichester.

472
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:03,519
Oh, darling, not Chichester. It's
sure to be full of Chichester people.

473
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:06,085
Brighton.
Do be serious!

474
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:09,077
They say Arundel is very pleasant
this time of the year, sir.

475
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:12,328
Arundel! What fun!
All right, then. Arundel.

476
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:19,699
We'll be married tomorrow. And we
won't ask anybody to the wedding.

477
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,712
Oh, blast!
What is it?

478
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:25,056
I forgot Balcairn is taking me
to lunch tomorrow.

479
00:32:25,057 --> 00:32:26,651
We're gonna have to wait till the
afternoon to marry.

480
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,131
Simon, whatever for?

481
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:30,932
He'll take you to Chez Espinosa
and you won't get a thing to drink.

482
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:35,501
Oh, I don't know. He wants a favour.
Help. Writing Mr Chatterbox probably.

483
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:37,875
Oh, but I can't possibly marry you
in the afternoon either.

484
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:40,830
I'm having my hair done. You can't have
forgotten it's Margo's party tomorrow.

485
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,329
I don't believe you really think we
are going to get married, Nina, do you?

486
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,004
Well, do you?

487
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:52,666
Yes. I just...
I don't know. I just...

488
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:57,925
I don't believe that really divine things
like that ever do happen.

489
00:32:57,926 --> 00:32:59,801
I don't know why.

490
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:06,586
Oh, I do like you so much tonight.

491
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,354
We'll send the car back at Arundel
and get a nice early train in the morning.

492
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:17,232
Oh, darling, am I going to be seduced?
I'm affraid you are.

493
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:19,507
Do you mind terribly?

494
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,837
Not as much as not to let it.

495
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:45,992
And you said really divine things
didn't happen?

496
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:48,680
I didn't think it was at all divine.
It's given me a pain.

497
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:52,560
And now that it's morning, I've got
something horrid to tell you.

498
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,475
I don't think anything can ever be
horrid ever again.

499
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:57,560
It's about that cheque
my papa gave you.

500
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:00,454
Don't thnk it's going to help
as much as you thought.

501
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,141
Well, it's a thousand pounds, isn't it?

502
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:04,371
Just look at it, my sweet.

503
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,948
I don't see anything wrong...

504
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:14,189
Oh, good lord, the old fool
signed it Charlie Chaplin.

505
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,433
That's what I mean, darling.
When did you notice the signature?

506
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,928
As soon as you showed to me
last night.

507
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:22,581
Only you looked so happy dancing
about in my flat all by yourself,

508
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:24,336
I didn't like to say anything.

509
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,823
The old devil!

510
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:30,172
Anyway, at least you've had some fun
out of it, haven't you? Or haven't you?

511
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:31,596
Haven't you?

512
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:33,970
Darling, I've never hated anything
so much in my life. Still....

513
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,835
As long as you enjoyed it,
that's something.

514
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,137
Charlie Chaplin, eh?
That's rather priceless.

515
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:44,819
I don't suppose I could use that
in my column?

516
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,223
No, certainly not.
No, thought not.

517
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:49,362
Look, I hope you don't mind coming here.

518
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:52,885
The truth is, I get meals for free if I
mention them occasionally in my page.

519
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:55,457
Not... not drinks, unfortunately.

520
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,459
Alfons, who's here?

521
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:03,351
Yes, not a bad list.
I'll see who I can mention.

522
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:05,127
Thank you, my lord.
Would you like a table?

523
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:07,572
Cocktail?
No, I don't think I want a cocktail.

524
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,356
I haven't really time.
Would you like a cocktail, Adam?

525
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,763
They're not really good here.
No, thanks.

526
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:12,250
Are you sure?

527
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:21,658
They always stick me at this bloody table.

528
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:25,949
The lager beer is rather good.

529
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:27,899
The lager will be perfect.

530
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,371
Two small glasses of lager, please.
Certainly, sir.

531
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:38,376
Oh, look, there's Brown, isn't it?
The Prime Minister, just leaving.

532
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:39,534
Yes, I rather think it is.

533
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:41,869
Wonder if he's going to resign
after the other night.

534
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:45,373
It's bloody typcal of Vanburgh to get that
juicy story about Agatha in Downing St.

535
00:35:45,374 --> 00:35:48,585
I mean, why couldn't Miles have
tipped me off instead?

536
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:51,827
Just because I wouldn't let him...
You know... In Oxford.

537
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:53,275
God, what a cat Miles is.

538
00:35:55,157 --> 00:35:56,184
Adam...

539
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,739
His mother's got a party tonight,
hasn't she?

540
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,384
For that evangelist Mrs Melrose Ape.
Are you going?

541
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:04,408
I think. Probably.
Adam, I'll tell you a very odd thing.

542
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:07,751
Margo hasn't sent me an invitation.
Why not?

543
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:10,925
Apparently she's in a rage about
that picture of Miles in my column

544
00:36:10,926 --> 00:36:14,937
and all those nasty hints even though
I had nothing, nothing to do with it.

545
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:18,520
People do take things so seriously.
Adam, I tell you, it means ruin.

546
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:21,942
Isn't that Pamela Poppum?
I haven't the faintest idea.

547
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:27,522
I'm sure. Yes, I'm sure it is. Now, tell
me, is that what they call a cloche hat?

548
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:29,498
I've got into terrible trouble the other
day about hats.

549
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:31,534
The editor was raving.

550
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:36,274
Ruin!

551
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:39,916
I mean, Margo's invited Jimmy
Vanbrough, of course, I guess.

552
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:43,158
Van's a cousin, isn't he?
But it's so damned unfair!

553
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:47,419
All my cousins are in lunatic asylums or
else they live in the country

554
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,506
and do indelicate things with wild animals.

555
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,895
If I miss this party I might as well
put an end to it all.

556
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:58,689
I'm sure if Margo only knew
how much it meant to me,

557
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,117
she wouldn't mind my coming.

558
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:03,325
Nobody invites me anywhere now.

559
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,947
I'll tell you what,
I know Margo pretty well.

560
00:37:05,948 --> 00:37:08,400
Why don't I ring her up
and ask if you could come?

561
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:12,233
Would you?

562
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,080
Would you, Adam?

563
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:16,973
Nothing.

564
00:37:16,974 --> 00:37:19,468
Really, I can't understand
what the young see in this.

565
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,702
These new crazes
are simply inexplicable.

566
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:26,351
Hello?
Margo, it's Adam.

567
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,726
Adam, darling! Now, don't tell me
you're going to cry off.

568
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:31,061
No, I just wondered if I can
bring someone with me?

569
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,669
Well, I really don't think you can.

570
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,044
I can't imagine how everyone
is going to get in as it is.

571
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,280
No, Justy, darling, not red.
Not at your age.

572
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:39,246
It suggests all the wrong things,
don't you feel?

573
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:42,689
I'm terribly sorry, Adam.
Who were you thinking of bringing?

574
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,483
Simon Balcairn.
He's terribly anxious to come.

575
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:48,468
Yes, I dare say he is. I'm rather
against that young man at the moment.

576
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,837
Oh, heavens!

577
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:56,629
No, you can't bring Simon.
He's been writing things in the papers.

578
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,405
Things about my son Miles
which are beastly.

579
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,480
Please, Margo?
Certainly not!

580
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:01,888
I won't have it inside my house.

581
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:03,994
I only asked Vanbrough on the
strictest understanding

582
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,870
that he doesn't write a word about it.

583
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:09,013
Mrs Ape will be addressing
everybody about Jesus.

584
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:11,456
It could all be too shriekworthy
a disaster to think of.

585
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,172
Absoluetly not!
Simon of all people!

586
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:21,754
You needn't tell me. I can tell.

587
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,540
Two of my butterflies at once!

588
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:26,333
Got your invitation to Lady Makland's
ball tonight, Balcairn?

589
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,530
Of course, lord Monomark.

590
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:30,548
You've been scooped by Vanbrough's
Lord Monocle column too often.

591
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:33,458
Maybe I should give Chatterbox
to Symes here.

592
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:36,552
He owes me.
I assure yiu, lord Monomark...

593
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,777
Be careful who you write about.

594
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,185
I'll be there myself.

595
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,140
Oh, God.

596
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:49,852
I'm done for.

597
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,681
Oh, poor Simon. I hope he doesn't
do something desperate.

598
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,286
He's so tense about everything.
Well, you know why.

599
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:01,395
Why?
He's lonely.

600
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:02,851
He's been in love with you
for years.

601
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:07,072
Love... All this fuss about love
and sleeping together.

602
00:39:07,073 --> 00:39:09,957
For physical pleasure I'd sooner
visit my dentist any day.

603
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,436
It isn't so bad though, is it?
What?

604
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,054
Love.

605
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:18,745
Well, perhaps it's a thing
one can grow to be fond of in time.

606
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:21,288
Like olives, I suppose.
Or talking pictures.

607
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:23,973
Still, it gives me pain and I doubt
it's worth it.

608
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:27,027
See, angels come down
from heaven to bless us.

609
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:58,164
Who's that with a beard?
A beard? How very odd.

610
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:12,092
Ladies and gentlemen!

611
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:15,814
We're very lucky to have with us,
freshly from her tour of Europe,

612
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:17,460
Miss...

613
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:20,864
I'm so sorry.
Her salvation tour of Europe.

614
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:27,109
Mrs Melrose Ape and her
Angels of the Glad New Day.

615
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:32,178
Girls, Ain't no flies!

616
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,408
Forgive me, gentlemen.
That man with a beard.

617
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:13,196
Do you know him?
Gives me something Foreign Office.

618
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:15,460
Sure I've seen him somewhere before.
Exactly.

619
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:17,938
Prime Minister, there are
spies everywhere.

620
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:20,675
I think it would be better
if we watched him.

621
00:41:20,676 --> 00:41:21,676
He looks Slavonic.

622
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:38,245
Yes, hello?
Central 4000, please.

623
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:40,849
Yes.

624
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:44,680
Hello!

625
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:49,028
Didn't know you were here, father.
I just thought I'd use the telephone.

626
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:51,890
Goodbye.
Stay exactly where you are!

627
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:56,127
And take off that beard.
Damned if I do!

628
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:57,425
Take off that beard!

629
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:02,631
Well if you will make
such a thing about it.

630
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,149
It hurts frightfully, too, if you knew.

631
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:08,347
There!

632
00:42:09,175 --> 00:42:11,284
Now I think you should go and make
Lady Thring take of her wig

633
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:12,111
while your about it.

634
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,519
I seem to have overestimated
the gravity of the situation.

635
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,486
Who is this?

636
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:18,608
Where are my detectives?
That is Mr Chatterbox.

637
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:20,276
Never heard of him.

638
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:23,060
Don't believe there is such a person.
He's clearly a Bolshevik spy.

639
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:25,664
Lord Balcairn, will you kindly
leave my house immediately?

640
00:42:25,665 --> 00:42:27,211
My wife has made it...
Lord what?

641
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,536
Is this young man called Chatterbox
or is he not?

642
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:30,954
Lord Monomark is here this evening.

643
00:42:31,273 --> 00:42:33,349
I shall  certainly inform him
of your behaviour.

644
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,172
He writes for the papers.
Oh, god, not another.

645
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:37,988
There's a conspiracy.

646
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:40,721
You're a disgrace to democracy, sir.

647
00:42:41,738 --> 00:42:44,929
Europe is going up in flames and all you
can do is info-talk of your zone to

648
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,595
my home to distress
my wife and family.

649
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:49,827
In another age I would have had you
horse-whipped and a styps in your club.

650
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:52,621
I've been forced to resign because
of you and your kind!

651
00:42:52,622 --> 00:42:55,778
Gentlemen.
Prime Minister.

652
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,160
Good night.

653
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:09,088
I sincerely appo...

654
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:14,146
Oh, to hell with you all!

655
00:43:43,082 --> 00:43:45,117
Brothers and sisters...

656
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:48,080
Just you look at yourselves.

657
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:53,449
Look inside yourselves.
Deep, deep inside yourselves

658
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:58,298
beyond the glister of your parties
and the saucy blaze of your jewels.

659
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:02,449
What a damned impudent woman!
Impudent, am I?

660
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:08,366
Is it impudence to look upon sin and
call it by its rightful name?

661
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:13,450
Impudence to gaze upon Babylon
and shriek down curses?

662
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:19,478
Impudence to look upon your souls and
see nothing but a black empty void?

663
00:44:20,346 --> 00:44:23,206
Beautiful young people.
That's what they call you.

664
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:28,855
Beautiful young people, well...
One out of three ain't bad, I guess.

665
00:44:29,882 --> 00:44:32,614
I say, that's rather good.
Why won't you listen?

666
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:37,633
The lives you lead aren't real lives.
The steps you dance are the Devil's.

667
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:40,927
Thank you Mrs Ape for
a most pricing talk.

668
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,957
Operater.
Hello? Central 4000, please.

669
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,625
Central 4000.
Hello? Balcairn here.

670
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:29,389
Do you want to speak to Social,
my lord?

671
00:45:30,556 --> 00:45:33,042
No, no, I don't want Social...

672
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,986
I want News.
News, my lord?

673
00:45:35,987 --> 00:45:38,870
Are you sure you don't want Social?
No. Yes. News.

674
00:45:40,844 --> 00:45:41,523
News.

675
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,769
Connecting you.
Thank you.

676
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:04,307
Hello?
News, sir.

677
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:06,652
Hello. Balcairn here.

678
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:10,414
Stick one of the boys on
to take this down, will you?

679
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:14,592
The most shocking orgy since the
days of Sodome and Gomora

680
00:46:14,593 --> 00:46:16,490
rocked society last night.

681
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:18,993
Hold the presses.
Get down to compositing.

682
00:46:20,223 --> 00:46:20,823
Now!

683
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:26,788
The vulgar evangelist Mrs Melrose Ape
proudly revealed that her angels

684
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:30,839
were no more than underage adornments
on sale to the highest bidder.

685
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:36,092
Meanwhile, tears coursing down her face,
the honourable Agatha Ransable

686
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:40,292
whose repulsive liaison with the Prime
Minister shocked the nation this week,

687
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:45,400
bewailed her, quote, ruined bogus
vapid bogus and worthless life, unquote.

688
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:49,033
Yes, two boguses.

689
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,198
Lady Makland, shrieking of her terrible
dependancy upon cocaine powder

690
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,991
threw off her Schiaparelli ball gown
and stood naked upon the dance floor

691
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:01,636
an example quickly followed
by old and young alike

692
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:03,922
until only the servants remained
clothed.

693
00:47:03,923 --> 00:47:08,581
A grotesquely hairy Archie Shwert
swing naked from the chandelier

694
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:12,753
screamed that all his money derived
from prostitution and the opium trade.

695
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:18,126
Lady Makland's son Miles howled and
howled and confessed to an intimate

696
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,330
beastliness involving five guardsmen
of the royal household

697
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:23,913
two mareens and a brick layer
from Hadersfield.

698
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:27,185
Nina Blount...

699
00:47:28,822 --> 00:47:30,010
Nina Blount...

700
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:34,619
grasped her stomach,
screamed she was a whore,

701
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,173
and misquoted several lines
of lady Macbeth

702
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:41,015
whilst Adam Fenwick-Symes cried
on heaven to bear witness

703
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,127
to his talentless penury and
hopeless illiteracy.

704
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:51,185
Never, never, never have such scenes
been witnessed in high society.

705
00:47:51,186 --> 00:47:55,149
That uneasy alliance between bright
young things and old survivors.

706
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,425
Perhaps this was the defining moment of
our epoque of speed and syncopation,

707
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:04,671
this so-called 20th century of angst,
neuroses and panic.

708
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:08,105
Reader, be glad that you have
nothing to do with this world.

709
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:11,578
Its glamour is a delusion,
its speed a snare,

710
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,722
its music a scream of fear.

711
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:18,213
Faster and faster they swirled,
sickening themselves with every turn

712
00:48:18,214 --> 00:48:23,831
The faster the ride, the greater the
nausia, the terror, the shame. Stop.

713
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:31,141
Yes, that's it.
Goodnight.

714
00:49:38,802 --> 00:49:39,810
Poking, have you?
Have you seen it?

715
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:42,953
Of course I want to sue!

716
00:49:42,954 --> 00:49:44,240
I want to sue, too.

717
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:46,955
I want to sue you, Margo,
I want to sue Monomark,

718
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:49,760
I want to sue this whole
damn country!

719
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:51,598
How much?! Am I covered?

720
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,260
I don't know, insurance against
acts of God, or acts of aristocrats!

721
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:56,637
He was insane.

722
00:49:56,638 --> 00:49:59,784
He was upper-class.
He was English, for Christ's sake!

723
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,400
You know why I sent for you?

724
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,975
I need a new Mr Chatterbox
and you owe me.

725
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:06,483
After this, sir, you're gonna have to
close the column down.

726
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,968
Are you crazy? We sold a hundred
thousand extra copies this morning.

727
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:11,901
I've had new advertisers on the
telephone since 9 o'clock.

728
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:14,984
No, no, the hysteria I can handle.
And you're part of it.

729
00:50:14,985 --> 00:50:16,951
You take the initiative,
make a story out of it.

730
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:18,517
The first thing we do
is you write a piece.

731
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:21,910
The last of the Balcairns!
Pitch it strong.

732
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,322
You knew the boy.
He was my friend.

733
00:50:24,323 --> 00:50:25,538
Friend? Don't hand me that, son.

734
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,744
I'm offering you 15 pounds a week,
he was only getting 10.

735
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,392
Next year, when you finish your
book, it will be greated with great

736
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:34,095
critical acclaim by all my newspapers.
And don't forget!

737
00:50:34,096 --> 00:50:35,861
I'm chairmen of the Montreal literary
prize.

738
00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:38,965
Award-winning writer,
Adam Symes.

739
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:40,451
Sound good?

740
00:50:40,452 --> 00:50:43,335
Meanwhile, you'll be getting
expenses.

741
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:46,675
Go to all the parties, race meetings,
and balls, you'll be going to anyway.

742
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,761
The real trouble is I'm not allowed
to write about anyone

743
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,737
who was at Margo's last night.
I mean, half of them are suing.

744
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:53,034
and the other half have only agreed
not to on the condition that their name

745
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:54,231
never appear in the column.

746
00:50:54,232 --> 00:50:55,669
You could always make them up,
I suppose.

747
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,934
Make them up?

748
00:50:56,935 --> 00:50:59,428
Half the people in the papers
one's never heard of, anyway.

749
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,537
Soldiers and explorers and painters
and composers and authors

750
00:51:04,538 --> 00:51:07,390
Why not invent some new ones?
Say, that might be rather something.

751
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:12,418
We can have...
the beautiful... Imogen Quest.

752
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:17,806
Heiress, adventuress, absinth drinker...
Drug-addicted and insatiable lesbian.

753
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,251
I can't write that!
You could imply it.

754
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:22,969
You're right!

755
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,865
So, Imogen Quest and
how about...

756
00:51:27,053 --> 00:51:29,258
The sinister count...
Zeldorf!

757
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:30,973
Nudist and...

758
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,209
Yodler!
I say, this could be rather fun!

759
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,555
I can even make up fashions!

760
00:51:35,556 --> 00:51:38,656
If I can get Archie Shwert to wear
suede shoes by the end of the month,

761
00:51:38,657 --> 00:51:41,211
you can call me Deirdre in public.
Yellow suede shoes.

762
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:44,134
Darling, you're a genius!

763
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:46,140
And green bowler hats.

764
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:06,099
Social, please.

765
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:07,815
Symes here.

766
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,786
Copy!

767
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:04,420
To Manchester races tomorrow
for the November handicap. Stop.

768
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:07,674
Oh, my dears, this is the this
most of them all.

769
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:11,266
To Manchester races tomorrow
for the November handicap.

770
00:53:11,995 --> 00:53:16,309
Count Zeldorf, now romantically linked
to the man-hating Imogen Quest,

771
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,778
Tiger, darling, feet off the table, I think.
Is expected to be there in one of

772
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,290
the new green bowler hats
sweeping society.

773
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:26,305
Green bowler hat?
Imagine!

774
00:53:27,223 --> 00:53:29,509
Imogen Quest? Everyone's
going on about her.

775
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,673
I don't believe there is such a person.

776
00:53:32,471 --> 00:53:34,296
Archie told me you've met her,
didn't you, Archie?

777
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:36,223
Imogen?

778
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:37,545
Known her for years.

779
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,320
It's cold and windy and I'm bored!

780
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:43,117
Prentise, pack everyhing up, lazy chap!
Sir.

781
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:46,132
We have to collect my winnings.

782
00:53:48,577 --> 00:53:51,551
Nina! I believe you know
who Chatterbox is.

783
00:53:51,552 --> 00:53:54,022
No, really, I don't. Do I, Adam?
No, haven't a clue.

784
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:57,109
For all I know, it could be you, Miles.
Oh, if only!

785
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:01,196
I so need the money. Oh, by the way!
By the way, I do hope you're all

786
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:04,599
going to come and see Tiger here
and his darling  little racing car

787
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,644
winning the RMS trophy next week!

788
00:54:06,645 --> 00:54:09,239
Oh, I say, can we?
I dare say I can get you in.

789
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,443
But can we be, how do you say?
Backstage?

790
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:15,735
You'll have to pretend to be mechanics.
Only officials are allowed in the pit.

791
00:54:15,736 --> 00:54:17,271
Oh, Adam, let's go!
I love cars!

792
00:54:17,272 --> 00:54:19,916
You look far too pretty to be
a fast driver, Tiger.

793
00:54:20,497 --> 00:54:23,849
Oh, dear, is that an awful thing to say?
Darling, he's not called tiger for nothing.

794
00:54:24,078 --> 00:54:27,461
Behind the wheel this cherub
becomes a demon!

795
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:30,375
Follow mother!
Oh, such laughs!

796
00:54:40,063 --> 00:54:41,920
Let's drive about.
You can drive us back to London.

797
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:44,574
Prentise can make his way by train,
can't you Prentise?

798
00:54:44,575 --> 00:54:45,315
Sir.

799
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,598
Well, let's go back now then
before it gets dark.

800
00:54:53,017 --> 00:54:54,175
Nina!
What, darling?

801
00:54:54,176 --> 00:54:55,411
That voice!

802
00:54:57,097 --> 00:54:59,422
Never mind. Look,
I have to stay, really.

803
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:02,395
Mr Chatterbox.
The big race is coming up.

804
00:55:03,117 --> 00:55:06,090
Well, I'll stick with you then, darling.
We can get down by train.

805
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:10,301
Too much Agatha and too much Miles
are just, well,

806
00:55:10,302 --> 00:55:12,909
Too much.
Whereas too much me is...

807
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:15,744
Not nearly enough.

808
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,485
I say, look! There's someone
actually in a green bowler.

809
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,887
Where?
There.

810
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:27,521
Oh, lord!

811
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:35,833
Who should I bet on for the
November handicap?

812
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:37,738
You're late, love.
You're under orders.

813
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,907
Oh...

814
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,303
Nina...
Yes, angel boy?

815
00:55:44,304 --> 00:55:46,967
It's not really enough to get married
on, is it, 15 pounds a week?

816
00:55:48,154 --> 00:55:49,831
Suppose you could always see
papa again...

817
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:52,644
Now that you're a successful journalist
he might take you more seriously.

818
00:55:54,709 --> 00:55:55,558
Oh, dear!
What?

819
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:58,342
Number seven is not so unbearable.
Number seven?

820
00:55:58,343 --> 00:55:59,958
It's Indian Runner!

821
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:03,889
Thirty to one! Who's ever heard of
Indian bloody Runner?

822
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,453
Oh my god, I was right!

823
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:09,756
Thirty three thousand pounds...

824
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:12,578
My major!

825
00:56:13,427 --> 00:56:14,874
My bloody major!

826
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:17,100
Darling?

827
00:57:00,614 --> 00:57:01,771
Look, Adam, this is Ginger!

828
00:57:01,772 --> 00:57:04,795
We used  to play as children and
he's been planting tea in Ceylon

829
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,991
and I haven't seen him for simply years,
isn't that a thing?

830
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:10,476
Danny Littlejohn. Only, I say, do
call me Ginger, everybody does.

831
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:13,468
Hang on.
Don't I know you, though?

832
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:15,415
Shepherd's hotel.
You did a coin trick.

833
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:18,558
Why, dash me twice! Your friend
won a thousan pounds off me.

834
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,896
Clever fellow.
That thousand pounds should now be

835
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,990
thirty-four thousand. Do you remember
me giving it to a drunken major?

836
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:27,798
Yeah, you won't see him for dust.
Thought so at the time, didn't like to say.

837
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:30,901
I know old majors. Yeah, they
stick at the ground in Colombo.

838
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:32,772
Don't pay their bridge debts,
famous for it.

839
00:57:32,773 --> 00:57:36,644
Bad luck! Look, I don't know about you
two but I'm just about fed up with racing.

840
00:57:36,645 --> 00:57:39,536
Why don't you come back to town
with me? My bus is parked outside.

841
00:57:39,537 --> 00:57:41,864
I'll just settle up here.
Oh, Adam, let's.

842
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,493
Pots, darling, simply pots.
Gold coming out of his ears.

843
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:48,629
I thought we were gonna stay up here
and see your father.

844
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:52,508
Look, why don't you stay up and you
can see my papa in the morning

845
00:57:52,509 --> 00:57:54,467
and then we can dine together tomorrow
night and you can tell me all about it?

846
00:57:54,502 --> 00:57:56,509
I've got bags to catch up with old Ginger here.

847
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,484
Come on, then!
What about tomorrow's Mr Chatterbox?

848
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:00,960
I can't very well write about
a night in a Manchester hotel

849
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:02,586
and a visit to your father, can I?

850
00:58:03,164 --> 00:58:05,298
Well, why don't I write it for you?
I'll be in London.

851
00:58:05,299 --> 00:58:06,756
I know just the kind of things you say.

852
00:58:06,757 --> 00:58:09,925
All right. I'll wire tonight's through to
the paper and you can do tomorrow's.

853
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:14,733
Deuce bit of luck running into you,
old girl!

854
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:16,730
Blast, I  don't know anyone in the old world now.

855
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:21,109
I've been sitting around Shepherd's,
bored as a gherkin. Beware behind!

856
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,103
Symes!

857
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:25,065
Bye, Adam!

858
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:27,216
Good afternoon, lord Monomark.

859
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:28,973
I was hoping to see you here.
Wanted a word.

860
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,730
Now see here, Symes, I like your page.
It's peppy.

861
00:58:30,731 --> 00:58:33,413
Lots of new names. It's got intimate
touch, which I like.

862
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:35,019
I read it every day.
So does my daughter.

863
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,691
We haven't had one single libel action
since you took over. Which is fine.

864
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:40,797
Now, what's all this about
bottle green bowlers?

865
00:58:41,524 --> 00:58:44,059
Well, I... There are only
a limited number at present.

866
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,435
You got one?
Let me see a green bowler.

867
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:48,745
I don't actually wear one myself.
Well, where have you been seing them?

868
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,748
I haven't seen one of them.
Well, there was a young man here earlier.

869
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:54,592
One swallow does not a summer make.
Nor one hat a fad.

870
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:56,819
And another thing.
Count Zeldorf.

871
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,338
I don't say he doesn't exist.

872
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:01,064
But ambassador Von Ribbentrop
doesn't know a thing about him.

873
00:59:01,065 --> 00:59:02,991
And I'm not in the business of
offending her Hitler.

874
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:05,625
So no more about him and no more
publicity for the restaurant Espinosa's.

875
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:09,029
They made up my bill wrong last night.
Espinosa's is the only place where I...

876
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:12,915
Have we got those three things clear?
Green bowlers, Zeldorf, Espinosa's.

877
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,238
Tabulate them in the mind, my boy!
One, two, three!

878
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:33,700
So, how's papa?

879
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:35,245
Very amiable.

880
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:37,196
Ten thousand this time.

881
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:40,969
Greta Garbo.

882
00:59:43,043 --> 00:59:44,809
Oh, well... We won't bother
about him anymore.

883
00:59:46,045 --> 00:59:48,110
By the way, I shan't be able
to come to the motor racing.

884
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:48,734
What?

885
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:51,078
I promised I'd help Ginger find
somewhere proper to live.

886
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:52,768
He's fed up with hotel life.

887
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:54,993
You know how thieving and ghastly
those housings can be.

888
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,576
I tried to telephone you last night.

889
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,628
Well, darling, it was
Rolo Littleworth's twenty-first

890
01:00:01,629 --> 01:00:04,341
and I thought it would be worth going
for the sake of Mr Chatterbox.

891
01:00:05,308 --> 01:00:07,394
You know I think I'd make
rather a good journalist.

892
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:08,975
What did you write?

893
01:00:08,976 --> 01:00:11,121
A few things about Rolo's
being expelled from Eton,

894
01:00:11,122 --> 01:00:13,416
and then, of course, I put in
lots of imaginary things,

895
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:14,942
and...
What sort of imaginary things?

896
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:15,826
Oh, I don't know.

897
01:00:15,827 --> 01:00:20,496
I said I saw count Zeldorf going into
Espinosa's in a green bowler, you know.

898
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:21,667
You said that?!
Yes.

899
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:23,891
Well, wasn't that a good thing to say?
I thought that's what you...

900
01:00:23,892 --> 01:00:24,668
Darling?
Excuse me!

901
01:00:24,669 --> 01:00:26,184
What's wrong?

902
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:31,614
Central 4000, please.

903
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,278
Symes here. Put me through to
the night editor, please.

904
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:36,311
I've got a message for you.
A message?

905
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:40,571
I'll put you straight to his lordship.
No, no, no, no, hang on a second!

906
01:00:40,572 --> 01:00:41,648
Symes?

907
01:00:42,427 --> 01:00:45,610
Good evening, lord Monomark.
Bad tabulation there, young Symes!

908
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:48,215
I'm, I'm awfully sorry.
I'm disappointed in you.

909
01:00:48,971 --> 01:00:50,669
Can't pretend that I'm not.
You're fired.

910
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:56,395
And now, Mrs Simpson, how can I
persuade you to return to America?

911
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:02,024
I mean,
you'd think there'd be a flubar.

912
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,828
Someone said something very
encouraging about a divine tent.

913
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:09,459
Officials, drivers, mechanics, stewards
and family only pass this point.

914
01:01:09,494 --> 01:01:12,052
We're family.
Oh, yes? Which car?

915
01:01:12,053 --> 01:01:14,575
Tiger La Bouchere.
He's my husband.

916
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:16,461
He's your what?!
My friend is confused, darling.

917
01:01:16,462 --> 01:01:19,525
Tiger is my husband.
Look, there he is!

918
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,475
How dreamy he is!

919
01:01:23,476 --> 01:01:25,730
What is it about boys and goggles?

920
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:28,944
P-13.
Hurah, my lucky number!

921
01:01:28,945 --> 01:01:31,059
You should be in brassards by rights.

922
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,834
What's a brassard?
You caught someone's fancy.

923
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,370
Hello!
I've been looking for you everywhere!

924
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:43,073
Well, I've been looking for you!
Where's my money?

925
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,059
I can't hear you!
Where's what?

926
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,175
My money!
It's no good.

927
01:01:47,176 --> 01:01:51,226
These infernal machines make too much
racket. What's your name?

928
01:01:51,227 --> 01:01:52,673
Adam Symes!

929
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:56,485
I must know your name!
Adam Symes!

930
01:01:59,477 --> 01:02:02,989
Look, I'm the spare mechanic!
How blissfully savage.

931
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:06,552
Now, rules. You can watch
from the pit on the track side.

932
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,433
You're not allowed to hand me
anything direct, but...

933
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,606
If I raise my left hand
as I come through the pit,

934
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,310
that means I shall be stopping
at the next lamp for petrol.

935
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:17,486
What does it mean if I wave this flag?
That you want me to stop.

936
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:20,511
But, angel botty, why should we
want you to stop?

937
01:02:21,813 --> 01:02:24,107
Well, you might see something
wrong with the car.

938
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:27,693
Or one of the officials might want
the number plate clean.

939
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:28,929
Now, look here, Miles.

940
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:32,891
Less  of the angel botty.
These people know me.

941
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:37,132
Clearly, they don't, darling. But don't
worry, I shall be discretion herself.

942
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,736
Come on, give it another go!

943
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:00,004
Come on, try it again!

944
01:03:04,543 --> 01:03:05,921
Was that car supposed to explode?

945
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:24,429
It's number 13!
Come on, 13! Come on!

946
01:03:26,144 --> 01:03:27,772
Oh well done, 13!

947
01:03:27,773 --> 01:03:29,918
Agatha, darling, you know you really
shouldn't have waved that flag.

948
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:31,420
My dear, how awful. Why not?

949
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:33,959
Well, it's blue, that means he is
to stop at the next lamp.

950
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,751
Oh, lord, did I wave a blue flag?
My, dear, you know you did.

951
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:42,012
How shaming! What am I to say to him?
Let's go away before they come back.

952
01:03:42,013 --> 01:03:43,231
You know, I think we'd better.

953
01:03:45,226 --> 01:03:47,032
Let's find that divine tent
and have a drink.

954
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:51,872
Look, there's you boyfriend again.
Persistant, I'll give him that.

955
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:52,810
There you are!

956
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:56,442
You know I've been chasing you all over
London? Where  the devil have you been?

957
01:03:56,443 --> 01:03:58,626
I've been staying at Lottie's.
But she's never heard of you.

958
01:03:59,525 --> 01:04:02,549
I'm going to admit I'd had rather
a few too many that night

959
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:05,601
and, to tell you the truth, I woke up
and things were rather a blur.

960
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,503
Then I found a thousand quid in my
pocket. And it all came back to me.

961
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:11,940
Some fellow at Lottie's had given me
his bundle to put on Indian Runner.

962
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:14,815
Now, as far as I knew,
the Indian Runner was no good.

963
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:18,111
I didn't want to lose your money for you
but the devil of it was I didn't know

964
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:20,646
you were Adam.
Adam, that's rather priceless.

965
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:22,104
Neither did Lottie, apparently.

966
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,764
You don't mean to say you still
got my thousand?

967
01:04:24,765 --> 01:04:26,849
Well, on the day of the race I
didn't know what to do.

968
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,813
One half of me said: "Keep the thousand,
the chap is bound to turn up some time

969
01:04:29,814 --> 01:04:31,584
and it's his business to do his own punting".

970
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:34,466
The other half said:
"Put it all on a favourite

971
01:04:34,765 --> 01:04:35,982
and give him a run for his money".

972
01:04:36,662 --> 01:04:37,559
So, you put it all on the favourite?

973
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:40,522
Well, in the end, I said young chap
must be frightfully rich.

974
01:04:40,523 --> 01:04:42,528
If he wants to throw his money away,
that's none of my business.

975
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:44,798
So I planked it all on Indian Runner
for you.

976
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,275
You mean...

977
01:04:47,276 --> 01:04:50,887
I mean I've got a nice little packet of 34
thou waiting for you to condescend

978
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:51,996
to pick it up!

979
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:53,323
Good heavens!

980
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,685
Look here, have a drink, won't you?
That's a thing I never refuse.

981
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:58,531
Archie, lend me some money until I
get this fortune, ok?

982
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,874
Well, how much do you want?
Enough to buy five bottles of champagne.

983
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:05,345
Darling, just think what parties
you can have!

984
01:05:12,769 --> 01:05:14,804
How well your lady friend moves, sir.

985
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:21,496
Look here, old boy, makes me feel awful to ask.

986
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:24,718
You couldn't possibly lend me a fiver,
could you?

987
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,012
I'll give it to you at the same time
I hand over the 34 thou.

988
01:05:27,013 --> 01:05:29,554
Of course. Archie, lend me a fiver!
Awfully good of you.

989
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:31,777
Would it be all the same if we made it
a telewire about it?

990
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:34,302
I'm sorry, I've only enough to get home.
That's all right, old, chap, I understand.

991
01:05:34,303 --> 01:05:35,371
Not another word about it!

992
01:05:35,372 --> 01:05:37,907
Look, you roll along to the Imperial
at about seven o'clock.

993
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:40,582
I'll give you your money then.
Glad to get it off my chest.

994
01:05:42,178 --> 01:05:43,686
Wow, 34 thousand!

995
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:45,673
Auntie must powder her nose.

996
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:47,159
Would Miles be a darling?

997
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:51,339
Going down.

998
01:05:56,715 --> 01:05:57,423
What's wrong with your driver?

999
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:00,093
One of the blokes has just hold
a spanner at him.

1000
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:03,820
Did he want to scratch? Who's the
spare? Who's the spare driver?

1001
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:07,078
Oh, wait! It's me! It's on my arm.
Oh. Are you going to scratch?

1002
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,123
Certainly not.
What's your name?

1003
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:12,319
Agatha. I'm the spare driver.
It's on my arm.

1004
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,359
Yes, I can see it is.

1005
01:06:13,394 --> 01:06:15,746
All right then start off
as soon as you like.

1006
01:06:15,747 --> 01:06:17,692
Excuse me...
No, no, no, rules are rules.

1007
01:06:17,693 --> 01:06:18,600
In you pop, miss.

1008
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:20,058
In you pop.
It's on my arm.

1009
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:22,671
I say, Agatha, are you sure
you're all right?

1010
01:06:22,672 --> 01:06:23,758
It says on my arm there.

1011
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:27,271
There's a good deal of Dom Perignon
swashing about inside you.

1012
01:06:27,272 --> 01:06:29,216
Are you quite sure it's
absolutely safe?

1013
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:31,493
Well that's new to say that, Adam.
As long as no one throws a spanner,

1014
01:06:31,528 --> 01:06:34,358
well, there'll be quite a little fuss
and I'll get through it.

1015
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:35,863
Well, goodbye.

1016
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:38,117
Not so scary.

1017
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:29,154
Well, good heavens, car 13 has stirred
off the course and seems to be speeding

1018
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:30,981
across four acre field.

1019
01:07:34,056 --> 01:07:36,560
Oh, my dears, that's lucky for me.
A really good story on my

1020
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,616
second day as Mr Chatterbox.

1021
01:07:38,617 --> 01:07:40,515
Where's that woman going
with my bloody car?

1022
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:42,699
Oh, she's probably remembered
a party somewhere.

1023
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,352
I expect you'll find it neatly parked and
polished and pretty in Barkley Square.

1024
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:49,989
Shall we, then?
This motor racing is a bore.

1025
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,701
I beg your pardon?
I take the trouble to find you...

1026
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,188
Oh, don't be stiff and pompus,
Tiger, dear.

1027
01:07:55,189 --> 01:07:58,072
Tiger, we've had a splendid day.
We've enjoyed ourselves immensely

1028
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:00,268
but it's getting late and I have to be
in town to pick up a fortune.

1029
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:02,947
If there's so much as a scratch
on her bonnet...

1030
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:05,869
I don't thin she was wearing
a bonnet, to be honest.

1031
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:07,894
You bloody people!

1032
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:11,495
Who the bloody hell do you
think you are?!

1033
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,974
If you just like to sign in,
you excellency.

1034
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:47,098
Excuse me?
A moment, sir.

1035
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:49,251
Telegram, your excellency.

1036
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:55,018
And you key.
Thank you.

1037
01:08:56,185 --> 01:08:58,322
Major!
My money.

1038
01:08:58,323 --> 01:09:01,027
Money?
A thousand pounds, plus 33 thousand.

1039
01:09:01,913 --> 01:09:05,862
Oh, that! People of Union Bank of London.
Never put your money into anything

1040
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:07,594
that wasn't straight, old boy.
Yes, of course.

1041
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:09,261
Very kind of you to have looked after it
for me.

1042
01:09:09,262 --> 01:09:11,127
Listen, you said you'd give me
the cheque this evening.

1043
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,604
Ah, that's another matter.

1044
01:09:14,222 --> 01:09:17,628
I told someone I'd give them the cheque.
But how do I know it was you?

1045
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:19,583
You might be a crook!

1046
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:23,384
Look, I've got two friends waiting for me
in Palm Court who'd swear to you

1047
01:09:23,385 --> 01:09:25,641
I'm Adam Symes, will that do?
It may be a gang.

1048
01:09:27,036 --> 01:09:28,761
Besides, I don't know what
the name of the chap

1049
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:30,536
who gave me the 1000 pounds was.

1050
01:09:31,574 --> 01:09:32,930
I only got you word for it.

1051
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:36,015
Now, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll sleep on it.

1052
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:38,479
I'll tell you my decision when I awaken.

1053
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:41,332
Don't think me suspicious, old boy.

1054
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:55,016
We've just heard.

1055
01:09:55,017 --> 01:09:59,250
They found Agatha at Houston Station
Staring fixedly at the model engine

1056
01:09:59,285 --> 01:10:01,650
in the Central Hall.
Apparently, the station master asked

1057
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:04,405
her name, but she just pointed to her
arm and said she was the spare driver.

1058
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:06,687
So they've carted her off to
a mental home.

1059
01:10:07,815 --> 01:10:08,309
What?

1060
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,638
Did you get your fortune?

1061
01:10:11,227 --> 01:10:13,432
The major's too drunk to recognise me
so he's just gone...

1062
01:10:14,832 --> 01:10:16,777
to... sleep.

1063
01:10:18,084 --> 01:10:20,518
Nina, I saw that major but
I'm affraid he might be bogus.

1064
01:10:20,519 --> 01:10:23,001
You haven't got any money.
No job, no money.

1065
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:25,725
We shan't be getting married soon.
Not soon.

1066
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:27,242
I see.
Well?

1067
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:29,338
I said I see.
Is that all?

1068
01:10:33,907 --> 01:10:34,855
Yes, Adam, that's all.

1069
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,165
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

1070
01:10:40,044 --> 01:10:41,690
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Nina.

1071
01:10:47,727 --> 01:10:54,140
When did you last pay us, dear? I must
make up that bill of yours some time.

1072
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:57,073
You're right. By the way, Lottie, that
foreign monarch, is he still staying here?

1073
01:10:57,074 --> 01:10:59,049
The king of Where-was-it?
Yeah.

1074
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,374
You might give him this.

1075
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,612
Scusi, but there is a telephone for
Mr Symes.

1076
01:11:06,613 --> 01:11:07,687
Thank you, Basilio.

1077
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:10,124
Oh, lord, it is mascara, isn't it?

1078
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,236
Hello?

1079
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:13,311
Darling, I'm affraid I've got something
rather awful to tell you.

1080
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,295
I'm engaged to be married.

1081
01:11:16,275 --> 01:11:17,123
Who to?

1082
01:11:17,124 --> 01:11:18,848
I hardly think I can tell you.
Who is it?

1083
01:11:19,995 --> 01:11:20,713
Ginger.

1084
01:11:20,714 --> 01:11:23,557
I don't believe it.
Well, I am, that's all there is to it.

1085
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:24,683
You're going to marry Ginger?

1086
01:11:24,684 --> 01:11:25,502
Yes.
I see.

1087
01:11:25,503 --> 01:11:26,845
Well?
I said I see.

1088
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:28,732
Is that all?
Yes, Nina, that's all.

1089
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:30,616
When shall I see you?

1090
01:11:30,617 --> 01:11:32,343
I don't want ever to see you again.

1091
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:34,548
I see.
Well?!

1092
01:11:34,549 --> 01:11:35,895
I said I see!

1093
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:37,769
Goodbye.

1094
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:51,975
Don't do that, Ginger, darling.
Your moustache tickles.

1095
01:12:17,646 --> 01:12:19,186
Darling, I can't really see
who it is.

1096
01:12:20,184 --> 01:12:21,950
There are some cocktail
things in the wardrobe.

1097
01:12:22,488 --> 01:12:23,755
Do make a big one.

1098
01:12:26,696 --> 01:12:28,350
You look just like Adam Symes.

1099
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:35,117
How are you feeling, Aggie?

1100
01:12:35,797 --> 01:12:37,271
Oh, rather odd, to tell you the truth.

1101
01:12:38,797 --> 01:12:39,684
How's Nina?

1102
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:41,589
She's got engaged to be married.

1103
01:12:42,577 --> 01:12:43,804
Ginger, I expect?

1104
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,379
Darling, you're so sweet.
Everyone guessed.

1105
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:49,995
Pots of money.

1106
01:12:51,102 --> 01:12:53,006
Are you really upset?
Desperate.

1107
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:54,968
Thinking of committing suicide like Simon.

1108
01:12:55,648 --> 01:12:58,823
Don't do that, darling.
Too many people are disappearing.

1109
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:02,048
Did you get your money?
No, the drunken major's disappeared too.

1110
01:13:06,537 --> 01:13:08,314
Agatha, I have nothing.

1111
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,139
All smashed up.

1112
01:13:13,145 --> 01:13:14,082
All to pieces.

1113
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:18,231
You know all that time I was dotty
I had the most awful dreams.

1114
01:13:19,866 --> 01:13:21,881
I thought we were all driving
round and round at a motor race

1115
01:13:21,882 --> 01:13:23,299
and none of us could stop.

1116
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,739
And there was an enormous audience
composed all entirely of

1117
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:31,319
gossip writers and gate crashers and
Archie Shwert.

1118
01:13:31,967 --> 01:13:36,250
Bogus people all shouting at us
to go faster.

1119
01:13:36,285 --> 01:13:39,048
And car after car kept crashing
until I was left all alone.

1120
01:13:39,776 --> 01:13:41,592
Driving and driving.

1121
01:13:41,593 --> 01:13:43,059
And then I would crash.

1122
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,076
And wake up.

1123
01:13:44,835 --> 01:13:48,425
Aggie, darling, how are you?
Goodness, how gothic!

1124
01:13:48,426 --> 01:13:50,800
How gloomy, how grim!

1125
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:54,235
My dear, how blind making.
I bought some records

1126
01:13:54,236 --> 01:13:56,630
in a funny little shop.
You are angelic.

1127
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:58,921
Do let's try them. There's a
gramophone under the bed.

1128
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:01,025
I saw lots of people at Margo's.

1129
01:14:01,026 --> 01:14:04,687
Some are coming round. Do you mind?
Oh, no, let's have a party.

1130
01:14:04,688 --> 01:14:07,424
We've never had a party in a mental
inn before, have we? Or have we?

1131
01:14:07,852 --> 01:14:08,661
Have we?

1132
01:14:40,169 --> 01:14:41,427
I love you all so much!

1133
01:14:49,857 --> 01:14:51,144
Again, again!
I think we need a little more!

1134
01:14:51,145 --> 01:14:52,272
I say, Miles...

1135
01:14:52,273 --> 01:14:54,807
So sorry.

1136
01:14:55,923 --> 01:14:56,770
So silly.

1137
01:14:59,316 --> 01:15:01,222
Only it's the beastliest thing.

1138
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,916
I've got to go now.
Train... France.

1139
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,962
It's so unbearably...

1140
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,265
unbearable.

1141
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:22,219
Tiger...

1142
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,953
Tiger of all people...

1143
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,028
Tiger?

1144
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,335
He left some letters.

1145
01:15:30,336 --> 01:15:31,054
From me.

1146
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,329
Lying around.

1147
01:15:34,757 --> 01:15:36,293
The police have them.

1148
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:42,349
There's a warrant.
For my...

1149
01:15:44,856 --> 01:15:46,622
I can't even go and pack.

1150
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:49,294
Hello, Aggie! Oh, I say...

1151
01:15:53,176 --> 01:15:54,812
Miles?
What's up?

1152
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:56,519
Goodbye, darling!

1153
01:16:01,518 --> 01:16:02,337
Goodbye, Archie.

1154
01:16:04,829 --> 01:16:07,079
You'll have a good story today, Van.

1155
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,985
Adam...

1156
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,876
Sorry, Nina.

1157
01:16:25,996 --> 01:16:28,211
Miles is in a scrape again.

1158
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:33,655
What's happened?

1159
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:36,130
Everyone's going round and
round and round!

1160
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:38,714
Keep dancing, everybody!
Miles has to leave the country.

1161
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,188
Police...

1162
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:45,886
Oh, no...

1163
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:47,992
Well...

1164
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,797
This is all a bit bloody.

1165
01:17:00,915 --> 01:17:02,212
Thought you were never going
to speak to me again.

1166
01:17:03,269 --> 01:17:04,486
Well, it had to happen, didn't it?

1167
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:12,000
Agatha's looking better
than I expected.

1168
01:17:13,517 --> 01:17:14,264
Oh, Nina...

1169
01:17:18,157 --> 01:17:18,945
What is it, darling?

1170
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:21,439
Oh, Nina, what a lot of parties!

1171
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:25,391
I know...

1172
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:33,503
You're so hot...

1173
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:37,368
Masked parties, savage parties,
Victorian parties...

1174
01:17:38,576 --> 01:17:43,327
Greek parties, Wild West parties,
Russian parties, circus parties,

1175
01:17:43,328 --> 01:17:45,604
parties where you have to dress
as somebody else

1176
01:17:45,605 --> 01:17:49,566
almost naked parties and St. John's
Wood parties and...

1177
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:54,071
and flats, and studios, and houses,
and ships and hotels and night clubs,

1178
01:17:54,072 --> 01:17:56,750
and swimming baths and windmills...

1179
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:01,849
Dances in London are so dull.

1180
01:18:02,947 --> 01:18:07,570
Comic dances and Scotland and
disgusting dances and the suburbs

1181
01:18:07,605 --> 01:18:11,846
all that succession and repetition of
masked humanity

1182
01:18:11,847 --> 01:18:14,628
all those vile bodies...

1183
01:18:16,197 --> 01:18:19,719
And now a party in a mental hospital!
Come back with me to Lottie's tonight.

1184
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,527
No...
Please?

1185
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:21,655
Ginger wouldn't like it.

1186
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,081
Nina, do you love him?

1187
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:25,008
Oh, Adam, how can you ask?

1188
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:27,481
Then why?

1189
01:18:30,494 --> 01:18:32,151
Oh, Adam, how can you ask?

1190
01:18:32,152 --> 01:18:33,340
Money?

1191
01:18:34,956 --> 01:18:35,894
Bloody money.

1192
01:18:40,763 --> 01:18:43,385
It's all very well to look down on money,
but a girl's got to look after herself

1193
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:44,692
these days.

1194
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:47,068
Come and dine with me at Lottie's.

1195
01:18:48,944 --> 01:18:51,299
Ginger wouldn't understand.
Last time, Nina.

1196
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:56,818
Well...

1197
01:19:05,737 --> 01:19:09,723
I believe you knew I was going to...
Oh, darling...

1198
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,784
If only you were as rich as Ginger...

1199
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,668
Or even half as rich.

1200
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,957
Really? Cocktails and gramophone
in a sick room?

1201
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:24,719
Who ever heard such a thing?
Out you go, the pair of you!

1202
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:30,407
Hello, dears!

1203
01:19:30,408 --> 01:19:32,162
Hello, Lottie!

1204
01:19:32,163 --> 01:19:34,777
Hello, Basilio.
Buona sera, Miss Blount.

1205
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:36,812
There was an angry fellow in here
for you today.

1206
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:39,656
Looked like a debt collector.
Vulgar moustache.

1207
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:43,971
I told him you've gone to Newcastle.
Don't like debt collectors.

1208
01:19:43,972 --> 01:19:45,717
What about my little bill?

1209
01:19:47,224 --> 01:19:48,682
We were thinking of
a spot of dinner first.

1210
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:51,366
In the dinning room, dear?

1211
01:19:51,367 --> 01:19:52,804
Of course not.

1212
01:19:52,805 --> 01:19:55,558
I'll have Basilio bring it up
to your room.

1213
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:06,425
Darling...

1214
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,962
You're too divine.

1215
01:20:08,781 --> 01:20:10,218
How are you?

1216
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:12,521
How are you?

1217
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:15,295
How angelic of you all to come.

1218
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:17,516
Ouch!

1219
01:20:18,584 --> 01:20:20,868
Only you must take care not to
fall out at the corners.

1220
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:24,699
I wish I knew which thing is which
in this car.

1221
01:20:26,286 --> 01:20:27,973
Darling, do try and drive straight.

1222
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,102
Faster!

1223
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:31,777
Faster!

1224
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:33,525
Faster!

1225
01:21:09,009 --> 01:21:10,306
That was the first day I met you.

1226
01:21:10,307 --> 01:21:12,821
Agatha and I came down to Oxford
to visit Miles.

1227
01:21:23,495 --> 01:21:25,700
You don't seem to be enjoying
yourself much this evening.

1228
01:21:27,147 --> 01:21:28,990
Sorry.
I'm being a bore.

1229
01:21:31,944 --> 01:21:33,222
Suppose I should go home now, really.

1230
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:35,718
Yes.

1231
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,004
What's the matter?

1232
01:21:43,181 --> 01:21:44,917
I'd give anything in the world for
something different.

1233
01:21:46,313 --> 01:21:48,269
Yes, but you don't have anything.

1234
01:22:00,454 --> 01:22:02,218
You do give me pain, you know?

1235
01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:05,732
Such pain.

1236
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:18,054
So, the little bird has flown, has she?
Sit down and have a glass of wine, eh?

1237
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,536
Let's sit.

1238
01:22:24,251 --> 01:22:26,138
Now, dear, what about my bill?

1239
01:22:27,926 --> 01:22:29,597
Oh, yes. Of course.
Well...

1240
01:22:29,598 --> 01:22:32,471
Have it made up and send it up to me.
I've got it here.

1241
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:37,051
Bless you! What a lot you seem
to have drunk!

1242
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:40,653
Well...

1243
01:22:41,361 --> 01:22:42,288
Thank you so much.

1244
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:45,370
I'll send you down a cheque.
No, dear, suppose you write it down here.

1245
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:50,409
Here's the pen, here's the ink and...
Oh, here's the blank cheque book.

1246
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:53,223
All right.

1247
01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:56,555
78 pounds.

1248
01:22:57,522 --> 01:22:58,470
16 shillings.

1249
01:22:58,471 --> 01:22:59,926
And a twopence for the cheque.

1250
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:02,950
And a twopence.

1251
01:23:04,697 --> 01:23:08,018
Charlie Chaplin.
There!

1252
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:14,685
Adam Fenwick-Symes, what a
childish scroll!

1253
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,474
Charlie Chaplin, indeed!
Private joke.

1254
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:20,450
Look who's turned up!

1255
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:24,398
If it isn't Mr... How do you do?
Come in and have a glass, dear.

1256
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:29,599
I knew you before you were born!
Yes, I know, Lottie.

1257
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:31,261
Look here, Symes, I want to
speak to you.

1258
01:23:31,262 --> 01:23:33,704
Perhaps we might go somewhere
where we won't be disturbed.

1259
01:23:33,705 --> 01:23:36,709
Bless you, boys, you just
have a nice chat.

1260
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:40,209
There's no one in the bar parlour.
I won't bother you, I have lots to do.

1261
01:23:42,744 --> 01:23:43,911
And may the best man win!

1262
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,440
Well?
What I'm about to say is that

1263
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:49,276
What I'm about to say may sound
rather unpleasant.

1264
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:52,692
But look here, you know, damn it!
I mean, the better man has won.

1265
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,660
Not that I'm saying that I'm the better
man. I wouldn't say that for a moment.

1266
01:23:57,459 --> 01:23:59,465
Awful bad luck on you and all that,
but still. When you come to think of it,

1267
01:23:59,765 --> 01:24:01,361
Look here, you know, damn it!

1268
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:02,948
Do you see what I mean?

1269
01:24:05,032 --> 01:24:05,851
Not quite.

1270
01:24:05,852 --> 01:24:07,403
Is it something about Nina?

1271
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:09,049
Yes, it is.

1272
01:24:09,718 --> 01:24:12,721
We are engaged. I'm not having you
butting in or there'll be hell to pay.

1273
01:24:13,379 --> 01:24:14,764
What makes you think I'm butting in?

1274
01:24:15,394 --> 01:24:18,318
You dined with her last night and
stayed out jolly late, too.

1275
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,453
How do you know we stayed out
jolly late?

1276
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,867
Well, as a matter of fact, I had to
talk to her about something

1277
01:24:23,868 --> 01:24:25,914
jolly important and I called her up once
or twice and didn't get an answer

1278
01:24:25,915 --> 01:24:28,469
until 3 o'clock!
Suppose you rang her every 10 minutes.

1279
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:30,173
Well...

1280
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:32,229
Not as often as all that.

1281
01:24:33,296 --> 01:24:34,534
I've known her since we were children.

1282
01:24:35,263 --> 01:24:36,563
Used to play with her,
a friend of the family.

1283
01:24:36,564 --> 01:24:38,868
I mean I know you were sort of
engaged, but...

1284
01:24:39,776 --> 01:24:41,761
Believe me, I had her photo
by my bed in Ceylon.

1285
01:24:41,762 --> 01:24:43,888
I know that sounds rather wet,
but there you are.

1286
01:24:45,842 --> 01:24:47,100
I mean...
The thing is...

1287
01:24:47,888 --> 01:24:49,824
I trust her, you know?
Of course I trust her.

1288
01:24:49,825 --> 01:24:52,189
I'm only kidding myself.
I'm no oil painting.

1289
01:24:53,097 --> 01:24:55,612
She doesn't like my tache, but my
upper lip's got a birth mark on it.

1290
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,538
You're saying she doesn't love you?

1291
01:24:59,466 --> 01:25:00,692
You're brainy.

1292
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,473
You don't have a port wine stain
on your upper lip.

1293
01:25:04,411 --> 01:25:06,158
You may be broke, but girls are odd.

1294
01:25:08,448 --> 01:25:10,204
I want you to promise me...
How much is she worth to you?

1295
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:12,132
Come again?
I'll sell her to you.

1296
01:25:13,928 --> 01:25:15,374
Good God, damn it.

1297
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:17,569
I'll sell my share in Nina
for a 100 pounds.

1298
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,573
You pretend to be in love with her
and you talk about her like that?

1299
01:25:19,574 --> 01:25:20,751
It's not decent.

1300
01:25:23,235 --> 01:25:25,711
Besides, a 100 pounds is a deuce of a lot.

1301
01:25:26,887 --> 01:25:29,132
Just put a deposit of 500 down for
a place in Charles St.

1302
01:25:29,133 --> 01:25:30,629
Investment's going up and down,
marriage isn't cheap...

1303
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:33,641
A hundred pounds down and I leave Nina
to you. I think that's cheap!

1304
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:36,964
Fifty!
A hundred!

1305
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,222
Seventy-five!
A hundred!

1306
01:25:38,223 --> 01:25:39,933
Damn it, I won't pay more than seventy-five.

1307
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:43,506
I'll take 78 pounds, 16 shillings and
twopence, I can't go lower than that.

1308
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:47,398
All right.

1309
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:52,973
You really will go away?

1310
01:25:53,684 --> 01:25:54,880
I'll try, Ginger.

1311
01:25:59,062 --> 01:26:00,484
Then you'll escape before Nina's heard,
poor girl.

1312
01:26:03,029 --> 01:26:04,535
I don't think you're a gentleman, sir.

1313
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:07,789
Neither do I.

1314
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,383
Miss Blount's residence.
Nina, it's Adam.

1315
01:26:19,331 --> 01:26:22,852
Oh, hello, darling!
I thought you might be Ginger.

1316
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,777
I woke up feeling I couldn't face him.

1317
01:26:25,778 --> 01:26:27,914
He rang up last night just as I got in.

1318
01:26:29,161 --> 01:26:31,554
Anyway, I don't think I want to
marry him after all.

1319
01:26:32,013 --> 01:26:33,471
Say, Nina, rather a strange thing's
happened.

1320
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,593
Lottie's presented her bill.
Oh, Adam... What did you do?

1321
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:38,573
Well, I did something rather
extraordinary.

1322
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:39,980
My dear, I sold you.

1323
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:42,545
Darling! Who to?
Ginger.

1324
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:45,998
He came round in a bate.
You fetch 78 pounds and 16 shillings.

1325
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:47,753
Well...
And twopence.

1326
01:26:47,754 --> 01:26:50,059
Goodbye, Nina.

1327
01:26:56,666 --> 01:27:00,346
Sir, how may I thank you? You find
my pen with little eagles!

1328
01:27:00,347 --> 01:27:04,897
Oh, bless you! God bless you!
I am mad with joy!

1329
01:27:06,884 --> 01:27:08,330
Not at all, sir.

1330
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:10,872
Come and listen to the wireless.
The funniest thing!

1331
01:27:14,645 --> 01:27:18,367
...that they were prepared at once to
withdraw their troops from Poland

1332
01:27:19,345 --> 01:27:22,208
the state of war would
exist between us.

1333
01:27:24,263 --> 01:27:28,653
I have to tell you now that no such
undertaking has been received.

1334
01:27:29,928 --> 01:27:34,808
and that, consequently, this country
is at war with Germany.

1335
01:27:56,122 --> 01:27:58,945
Dearest dear, I'm so glad you
wrote back at last.

1336
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,453
How proud of you I am.
Everyone says you should have a VC.

1337
01:28:06,796 --> 01:28:09,516
Now, darling, the baby is called Tommy.

1338
01:28:10,533 --> 01:28:12,258
And he looks so like a miniature you.

1339
01:28:13,048 --> 01:28:14,983
Of course Ginger is convinced
that he's the father.

1340
01:28:15,811 --> 01:28:17,765
He and little Tommy are in a ghastly
house in Plat Street but, angel,

1341
01:28:17,766 --> 01:28:20,249
guess where I'm living now
to be near my new job?

1342
01:28:20,948 --> 01:28:22,485
Shepherd's Hotel of all places!

1343
01:28:23,492 --> 01:28:27,169
Do hurry home, darling, they started
bombing London, which is horrid.

1344
01:28:27,204 --> 01:28:28,539
Fender, hold!

1345
01:28:29,926 --> 01:28:32,988
I say, it's all right!
I'm English!

1346
01:28:34,865 --> 01:28:35,870
I'm English!

1347
01:28:36,819 --> 01:28:39,891
Are you now?
I can't really tell in this smoke.

1348
01:28:41,169 --> 01:28:42,646
My God!
You're the drunk major!

1349
01:28:43,273 --> 01:28:46,257
I'm not drunk, damn you, sir!
And, what's more, I'm a general!

1350
01:28:46,258 --> 01:28:47,885
What the deuce are you doing here?

1351
01:28:49,472 --> 01:28:52,046
To tell the truth, sir, I lost my platoon.
Lost your platoon?

1352
01:28:52,655 --> 01:28:54,060
I lost my whole bloody division!

1353
01:28:54,061 --> 01:28:56,456
Is it all over, sir?
Hard to say frankly.

1354
01:28:56,457 --> 01:28:59,171
Thing to do is head to the beach
and see if the Navy can pick us up.

1355
01:29:00,189 --> 01:29:02,821
Not that things are any better in London.
They bombed St James's last night.

1356
01:29:02,822 --> 01:29:05,506
Shepherd's Hotel flattened.

1357
01:29:06,503 --> 01:29:07,990
Poor old Lottie.

1358
01:29:09,317 --> 01:29:11,177
Hang on, I know you from her, don't I?

1359
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:12,924
I owe you some money.

1360
01:29:12,925 --> 01:29:14,620
34 thousand pounds.

1361
01:29:14,621 --> 01:29:17,433
34 thousand and five!
Never forget a debt!

1362
01:29:18,412 --> 01:29:20,040
Looked for you everywhere
before this scratch started.

1363
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:21,867
Even went to bloody Newcastle!

1364
01:29:22,933 --> 01:29:24,392
Might as well give you a cheque
here and now.

1365
01:29:24,393 --> 01:29:27,256
Shepherd's Hotel completely gone?
Yeah. All dead.

1366
01:29:27,257 --> 01:29:28,283
Name?

1367
01:29:29,251 --> 01:29:30,468
Adam Fenwick-Symes.

1368
01:29:31,924 --> 01:29:34,858
Shared a trench with a major
Fenwick-Symes during the last show.

1369
01:29:35,617 --> 01:29:36,395
My father.

1370
01:29:37,182 --> 01:29:38,729
He played a fool, too.

1371
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,188
Or was it a violine? Ha!

1372
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:44,001
There you go!
Thank you.

1373
01:29:44,898 --> 01:29:48,121
Got a case of bubbly in the car.
Let's see if there is any light in it.

1374
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:41,431
It would have been blown away on
the beach by them Stukas, sir.

1375
01:30:42,231 --> 01:30:43,649
Bloody miracle, eh?

1376
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:46,412
Yes.

1377
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,667
Bloody miracle.

1378
01:30:53,432 --> 01:30:54,100
Are we in Dover?

1379
01:30:56,424 --> 01:30:57,373
That's right, sir.

1380
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:01,833
Break open this door.

1381
01:31:02,771 --> 01:31:06,222
It's customs enacted property, sir.
Break it open, private!

1382
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,029
Sir.

1383
01:31:14,754 --> 01:31:16,949
Sure you know what you're doing, sir?
There's something of mine in here.

1384
01:31:17,696 --> 01:31:19,504
At least, it might still be here.

1385
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:31,887
So, what brings you to sunny Plat St.?

1386
01:31:33,402 --> 01:31:34,661
I just came to see you and the boy.

1387
01:31:37,843 --> 01:31:38,890
Can't offer you much to drink.

1388
01:31:41,436 --> 01:31:44,511
Well done on all those medals.

1389
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,646
If it hadn't been for my fallen archers,
my ass would have...

1390
01:31:47,647 --> 01:31:49,053
Absolutely.

1391
01:31:50,429 --> 01:31:53,353
Tommy! Turn that row off!
Come and meet your godfather!

1392
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,615
Sorry, we didn't ask your permission.

1393
01:31:57,616 --> 01:31:58,941
Nina didn't get mine.

1394
01:32:04,329 --> 01:32:05,728
Hello, Tommy.
I'm Adam.

1395
01:32:06,665 --> 01:32:08,202
How do you do?

1396
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,757
How do you do?

1397
01:32:11,884 --> 01:32:13,000
Ginger, did they ever find Nina?

1398
01:32:13,948 --> 01:32:16,130
Nina? She's having a whale of
the time in the factory.

1399
01:32:17,917 --> 01:32:19,025
She's alive?

1400
01:32:19,026 --> 01:32:21,129
Of course she is.

1401
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:23,334
I thought everyone at Shepherd's
was killed.

1402
01:32:24,301 --> 01:32:26,166
Oh... Nina was in the night shift.

1403
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:28,232
No, she'll be back later.

1404
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:31,496
This war has been all right for some.

1405
01:32:34,819 --> 01:32:36,476
I'm gonna be arrested.

1406
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:39,085
Arrested?
Bloodiest thing.

1407
01:32:39,973 --> 01:32:42,005
Tried to help people out.
A little petrol here,

1408
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,121
Some life's little luxuries there...

1409
01:32:45,647 --> 01:32:46,994
I mean, dash it, war cannot all be misery!

1410
01:32:46,995 --> 01:32:49,575
Anyway, I've had everything
confiscated and I'm gonna be arrested.

1411
01:32:49,576 --> 01:32:51,102
Are you a soldier?

1412
01:32:51,772 --> 01:32:54,146
Yes, Tommy, I am.
It's all just so damnably unfair!

1413
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:57,726
All right for some.
If I just had some cash i could...

1414
01:32:58,513 --> 01:32:59,929
make it to Ireland and move over to America.

1415
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:02,325
They appreciate people like me in the States.

1416
01:33:06,436 --> 01:33:07,114
How much?

1417
01:33:09,789 --> 01:33:11,026
How much do you need?

1418
01:33:12,742 --> 01:33:15,024
Well, lot of people to sweeten on the way.

1419
01:33:15,744 --> 01:33:17,419
How would 34 thousand do?

1420
01:33:18,925 --> 01:33:20,363
34 thousand... pounds?

1421
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:21,998
And five.

1422
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:25,312
I'll buy Nina and Tommy off you for
34 thousand and five.

1423
01:33:28,414 --> 01:33:29,603
Hadn't we done this before?

1424
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:27,719
Ginger?

1425
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:30,293
Are you drunk?

1426
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:42,337
... whereas I Ginger Littlejohn in
consideration of the sum of

1427
01:34:42,338 --> 01:34:46,827
34 thousand and five pounds do
relinquish all claims of my wife Nina

1428
01:34:46,828 --> 01:34:49,093
Littlejohn and son Thomas Edward.

1429
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,537
Signed Ginger Littlejohn.

1430
01:34:53,363 --> 01:34:54,610
Have I been sold again?

1431
01:34:57,404 --> 01:34:58,401
Do you mind terribly?

1432
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,415
Have we any money left?

1433
01:35:02,311 --> 01:35:03,389
None at all.
