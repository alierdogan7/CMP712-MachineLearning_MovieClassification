Do you understand?

338
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,660
Why didn't you tell me
my mascara was running?

339
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,378
Now say it like
you got a pair.

340
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,981
ALL: Yes, Drill Sergeant.

341
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,683
Here. This will
take the edge off.

342
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,018
What do you think this
is, a rehab facility?

343
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,254
I don't do drugs!
My body's a temple!

344
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:52,676
Did you think that bus
was going to a Phish
concert? Put that away!

345
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:56,781
Now, listen up.
This is your First
Sergeant, Louisa Morley.

346
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:59,516
She'll be overseeing
your training here
at Fort Jackson.

347
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,586
You will address
her as First Sergeant.

348
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:07,508
Certainly have hit a new low,
haven't we, Sergeant Evans?

349
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:09,209
Yes, First Sergeant.

350
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,347
Name, soldier.

351
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,448
Jeter, First Sergeant.

352
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,434
Don't I know you?

353
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,186
Proudly served
as sergeant at
Fort Benning.

354
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,688
Traded my stripes
in for marriage.

355
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:24,258
That fell through.

356
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:27,427
Came back for the
love of my country,
First Sergeant!

357
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:30,730
A woman scorned is
a good soldier.

358
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,516
Welcome back,
Private Jeter.

359
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:39,190
What's your name?

360
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,624
Ma'am, Petrovich, ma'am.

361
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:44,444
"Ma'am"? I worked hard
for my rank, Private.

362
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:47,097
You will address me
as First Sergeant.

363
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,265
Are we clear?

364
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,417
Yes, First Sergeant.

365
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:51,869
Are you about to cry?

366
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,456
Ain't no crying in
the Army, baby girl.

367
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:58,442
'Cause I ain't got time
to be changing no diapers.
Are we clear?

368
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,310
Yes, First Sergeant.

369
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,483
Oh!

370
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,084
Did I just catch you
eyeballing me?

371
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,019
No, First Sergeant.

372
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,573
Am I attractive to you?

373
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,159
'Cause I'll only break
your heart, sweetheart.

374
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,622
Name, soldier.

375
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,307
Private Castillo,
First Sergeant.

376
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:33,995
What are you?
Huh? You some kind
of gangbanger?

377
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:39,000
What you gonna do?
What, you gonna
cut me, mommy?

378
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,970
Is that what you gonna do?
You gonna cut me?

379
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,556
No, First Sergeant.

380
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:48,876
I got my eye on
you, Casti-ho.

381
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:53,198
This is the
United States Army.

382
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:56,184
We will tolerate
nothing but...

383
00:20:56,252 --> 00:21:00,872
Excuse me? Excuse me? Hi.

384
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,493
This is really embarrassing.
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'm Megan Valentine.

385
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,794
Mmm-hmm.

386
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:08,763
The actress?

387
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,781
Hey.

388
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

389
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,302
See, this really isn't
what I was picturing

390
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,838
when the recruitery
guy was telling me
about me finding myself.

391
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:22,260
Really? Well,
come on over here a
second, sweetheart.

392
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,762
But first, who
are you wearing?

393
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,498
(CHUCKLES)
Dolce and Gabbana.

394
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,800
Ah!

395
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:30,019
Stunning. Stunning.

396
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,771
Thanks.

397
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:36,025
It looks like we've got
ourself a special visitor
today. Megan Valentine.

398
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:39,328
Why don't we all
give her a round of
applause? Come on!

399
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,096
Come on.
No, you all can do
better than that.

400
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,765
Let's hear it for
Megan Valentine.

401
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,133
Hi.

402
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,870
Let's hear it for Megan.
She's just pretty as a peach.

403
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:52,307
Thank you.
Between us girls,

404
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,278
I need a bath,
a phone and, like,
20 hours of sleep.

405
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:57,146
Do you know any cute,
like, B and B's around here?

406
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:58,281
Let me think.
Bed and breakfast?

407
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,582
Yeah.

408
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,319
Nearby. And you'll probably
need a ride too, huh?

409
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,953
You're a doll.

410
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,522
Well, then
by all means,

411
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,425
let me ride you,
Miss Daisy.

412
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,376
Drop and give me 10.

413
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:13,512
Ten what?

414
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,731
Ten push-ups.
Drop and give me 10!

415
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,985
Will you hold
my bag? Thanks.

416
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:23,339
I think I wanna take
the scenic route, Evans.

417
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,424
My grandmother can
do a better push-up
than that.

418
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:28,795
Off your knees. This isn't
the Girl Scouts! Now, down.

419
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,997
I said, feet back. Down!

420
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:32,231
I'm trying.

421
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,367
Up! Down.

422
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:38,470
Up. Down. Hold it
when I say down.

423
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:43,910
Down. Up. Down. Up.

424
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:48,480

Get up, Hollywood!
Get up!

427
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:56,890
Okay.

428
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:01,394
As you can see,
I'm a huge fan.
Really, I am.

429
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:04,998
But we just seem to have
a teeny weeny problem here.

430
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:09,185
You see right here?
Like the VIP, girlfriend,
you on the list.

431
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:14,391
So as long as your
name is on my list,
you're not going anywhere.

432
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,544

I made a mistake.
I need your help.

436
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:29,489
I crashed my car and now
I'm at the Army and
everyone's yelling at me.

437
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:33,626
Come on, you know
how much that tube
of eye cream goes for?

438
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:36,963
No, not the Libra.
I have been on
a waiting list.

439
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,532

That's so wrong.

444
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,678
I don't wear
underwear.

445
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:55,648

Gosh. Where's my room?

449
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,396
These sheets better have
a decent thread count.

450
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,281
Can you believe that?
She just sees a tattoo

451
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,416
and just assumes I'm
in a gang or something.

wanna make it through.

then you don't eat.

1356
01:15:56,305 --> 01:16:01,476
Due to circumstances I can
control, I won't be making
this journey with you.

1357
01:16:01,544 --> 01:16:05,413
Five, four, three, two, one.

1358
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:06,747

1360
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:11,636
Wait for me,
I'm coming.

1361
01:16:11,954 --> 01:16:14,555
Well, it looks like
we're suffering for
Valentine yet again.

1362
01:16:14,623 --> 01:16:15,674
Yeah, it looks that way.

1363
01:16:15,741 --> 01:16:16,842
Come on, I came
back, didn't I?

1364
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:20,445
Don't do us any
favors, Valentine.

1365
01:16:20,513 --> 01:16:24,332
Like it or not, I'm your
team leader and I have
something to say.

1366
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:27,535
Yes, I screwed up,
but you have to
give me another chance.

1367
01:16:27,603 --> 01:16:31,406
Why? Because, Johnson,
you wanna go home and
see your little girl.

1368
01:16:31,474 --> 01:16:34,576
Castillo, if you don't go
home soon, your boyfriend's
gonna cheat on you.

1369
01:16:34,644 --> 01:16:35,777
(SCOFFS)

1370
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:39,397
And, Hamamori, weed
doesn't grow on its own.

1371
01:16:39,465 --> 01:16:43,301
Petrovich? I wanna do
this for your brother
as much as you do.

1372
01:16:45,154 --> 01:16:47,739
So what do you say?
Are we gonna do this?

1373
01:16:49,191 --> 01:16:51,075
Is the speech over?

1374
01:16:51,143 --> 01:16:53,778
Damn, you girls are
tough. Now, move out.

1375
01:16:56,716 --> 01:16:58,016
Good try.

1376
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:04,039
Would you look at this?

1377
01:17:06,276 --> 01:17:09,912
Looks like little
blonde Riding Hood
bought us lunch.

1378
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,665
Anybody hungry?
Help yourselves.

1379

I'm not your Sherpa.

1380

You can all split mine,

1381

on determination and pride.

Hmm?

1384
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:32,584
I think my compass
is broken.

1385
01:17:32,652 --> 01:17:35,520
You got that right.
Give me that.

1386
01:17:35,588 --> 01:17:37,923
First of all,
it's backwards.

1387
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:40,259
Where the heck are we?

1388
01:17:40,326 --> 01:17:42,995
This doesn't make
any sense. Valentine,
let me see that map.

1389
01:17:43,063 --> 01:17:44,163
I'm starving, guys.

1390
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:45,264
Me, too.

1391
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,769
I could have sworn
I put it in here.

1392
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:53,255
So help me God, Valentine,
if you don't have that map...

1393
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:56,558
It's gone.

1394
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:57,910
You're kidding, right?

1395
01:17:57,977 --> 01:17:59,195
I told you she'd screw up.

1396
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,946
Of course she screwed up.

1397
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,248
She's a self-absorbed
prima donna who only
cares about herself.

1398
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:05,734
PETROVICH: Well, you don't
have to be so mean, Castillo.
She came back.

1399
01:18:05,802 --> 01:18:07,669
Please, are you speaking
for the entire fan club?

1400
01:18:07,737 --> 01:18:08,838
HAMAMORI: Don't make her
cry, Castillo.

1401
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:10,272
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1402
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,606
Okay. Well, bring
it on, cry baby.

1403
01:18:11,674 --> 01:18:13,842
I'm not gonna...

1404

HAMAMORI:
Hey! Take it easy.

1405
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:21,801
Enough. Enough!

1406
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:24,688
If we're gonna make
it through this, we
gotta work as a team.

1407
01:18:24,756 --> 01:18:29,692
Hamamori, you're the one
who always has your hand up
in those navigation classes.

1408
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,144
Help us out.

1409
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:32,612
I mean, we might be
able to get

1410
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,682
to the first navigation point
using dead reckoning.

1411
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:41,971
Everybody got a
full belly? Good.

1412
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:47,243
Fitzsimmons, you're on
first shift guard duty.

1413

turn in real early

because my team leaves
before first light.

1416
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:04,895
We're gonna get
this wounded soldier
to the hospital first.

1417
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:07,730
Why?

1418
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:12,251
Because he's got a family
at home worried sick that
he's not coming back.

1419
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:19,542
And the last thing his
wife is thinking is that
he's cheating on her

1420
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:22,178
with the girl
from Circuit City
with the fake tits

1421
01:19:22,246 --> 01:19:26,800

TV screen that she bought
for him for his birthday!

And I don't do bugs.

What I would give
for a burrito con pollo
right now.

I'd do a Number 5
with a super scoop
of curly fries.

for processed foods.

off of the land.

I can't eat land.

01:19:59,934 --> 01:20:01,885
Petrovich, you brought the
mosquito netting, right?

1434
01:20:01,953 --> 01:20:03,604
Yeah.

Well, if you haven't,
you should.
It's a good book.

01:20:09,078 --> 01:20:11,061
Anyway, when my dad
read it to me,

1438
01:20:11,129 --> 01:20:15,399
he also told me that when
you pee-pee in the water,
it attracts fish.

1439

That's disturbing.

ball-gagged by now.

behind everybody else, right?

1468
01:21:33,796 --> 01:21:35,763
Yeah, we're gonna have
to haul ass at daylight.

1469
01:21:35,831 --> 01:21:39,268
So we should
probably turn it in?

1470
01:21:39,035 --> 01:21:40,151
Yeah.

01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:41,553

I'll clean up.

your own, Valentine.

We're close. I know it.

There it is!

1479
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:20,575
Finally.

1480
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:22,477
We should call
him Bernie.

Let's do this, guys.

1483
01:22:26,332 --> 01:22:28,901
We have about two
hours to get Bernie
to the hospital.

1484
01:22:28,968 --> 01:22:31,353
If we follow these
coordinates, it's at
least a five-hour hike.

1485
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,638
Then we'll never make it.

1486

Maybe we can hitch a ride.

1487
01:22:37,361 --> 01:22:39,312

to a civilian?

don't touch them.
