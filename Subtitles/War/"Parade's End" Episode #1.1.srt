00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:41,197
Mrs Tietjens is not at home.

172
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:42,437
Oh, but she...

173
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:47,117
- Sylvia, you are such a rotter.
- Well, I'm not dressed for a picnic.

174
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,037
Anyway, I've realised there's no point in a fling
if one's husband doesn't notice.

175
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:56,317
- I'd go!
- It's no use, Potty loves me!

176
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,438
He wants me to leave Christopher
and go abroad with him.

177
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:03,597
Oh, I'd like to shake him!

178
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:08,757
- Who?
- My husband, of course.

179
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,398
Shake some reaction
out of that great lump!

180
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,877
Do you happen to have a cigarette?

181
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,158
Yes, of course.

182
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:24,518
Thank you.

183
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,957
Now look here,
don't be obtuse, Tietjens.

184
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,117
Dammit, man, is the department's duty
to support Waterhouse

185
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,397
and make his case to the house.
Do you understand?

186
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:51,061
Minister has to show the figures
for the insurance bill will balance.

187
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:54,847
Well, they won't. And I should have thought
it was this department's duty to tell him so.

188
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:58,717
Tietjens, you're the cleverest young
man in London, Macmaster says,

189
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:01,277
and I'm inclined to believe him.

190
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,557
But he and I,
with our blunt instruments,

191
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,717
have managed to grasp
something that you cannot.

192
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:10,197
- Why thank you, Sir Reginald.
- Which is...

193
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,117
that if they don't get what they
require from you, they'll put some

194
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:16,998
competition-wallah head clerk on it
and take our credit from us.

195
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,997
I simply wish you to be
aware of the fact...

196
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,957
there's no difficulty in adjusting
the calculations to produce

197
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,957
a more congenial result.

198
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,282
I can let Macmaster have it
in the hour and 10 minutes remaining

199
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,718
but I insist on his taking
credit for it.

200
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,478
Good man.

201
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,477
Votes for women!

202
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,237
It's him, it's Waterhouse!

203
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,518
(WOMEN SHOUT)

204
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,197
What the devil is going on here?

205
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,917
- Keep moving, sir.
- Excuse me.

206
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,957
This way, please.

207
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,397
We came through without a scratch.
Thanks, Bertram.

208
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,718
My fault for inviting a liberal.
Christmas spirit, you know?

209
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,758
Will you be going on to Diana's?

210
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,478
- Merry Christmas, Victoria.
- Merry Christmas...

211
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,758
- Christopher! There you are at last.
- Yeah, sorry.

212
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,660
- You look lovely.
- You look like thunder.

213
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:32,598
You didn't mind that
I let Potty bring me ahead.

214
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,237
No, of course not.

215
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:39,197
- Will you dance?
- I would if that were dancing.

216
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,918
Will you save me one
when there's a tune?

217
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:01,997
- You're a writer?
- Ah, yes, a little of the critic.

218
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,718
- My book on Rosetti will be appearing...
- Macmaster.

219
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:09,197
- How rude!
- That fellow over there with Sandbach.

220
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,437
He's the Right Honourable
Stephen Waterhouse.

221
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:15,917
He's the swine that made us
fake that schedule at the office.

222
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,877
- I'm going to have a word with him.
- For God's sake, Chrissie!

223
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,397
Those suffragettes, I would have
whipped till they bled.

224
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,877
Spank them, that's what I say.

225
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,837
What have we come to

226
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,997
when a government minister can't go
anywhere without a policeman?

227
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:32,237
Perhaps if the Prime Minister
had kept his promise to address

228
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,757
the women's concerns after
the summer recess...

229
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:39,157
- Christian, my dear fellow...
- The women would keep their promise to stop protesting,

230
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,437
- while the police had their hands full with the coronation.
- Give the PM a chit.

231
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:46,317
Quite right. Tietjens, hark to my
brother-in-law, the general.

232
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:50,717
Tietjens. Oh, you must be the genius.
Allow me to thank you.

233
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:54,117
We couldn't have got the insurance
bill before the house

234
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:56,957
till the next session
without your figures.

235
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,997
You're taking the credit
from Macmaster.

236
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:02,187
Oh, no, we know who to thank.
Sir Reginald let it out.

237
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,757
Macmaster?
He the fellow you brought with you?

238
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,678
Who are his people?

239
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,838
His father was a shipping
clerk in Edinburgh.

240
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,678
Well!

241
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:23,638
- Was he angry with me?
- Angry with his wife, I expect. We got the brunt.

242
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:29,317
- No! No, Potty.
- Yes.

243
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,397
Don't call me Potty.

244
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,558
But it suits you.

245
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,717
Will you come away with me?

246
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,558
Well, I might... one day.

247
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,037
Sylvia has gone off
with that fellow...

248
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,038
Perowne.

249
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:23,677
I'm letting Lowndes Street,
and warehousing the furniture.

250
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,517
I'm taking Michael
to my sister, Effie,

251
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,997
she's married to a vicar who has
one of our livings.

252
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,918
Marchant will go with him.

253
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,038
- So you'll be wanting your old rooms?
- Mm-hm.

254
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,197
One...

255
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:24,157
two...

256
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:25,696
Three...

257
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,678
Your aunt Effie.

258
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,838
Five... six...

259
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,401
Walk on.

260
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Trott on.

261
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:05,968
Poor child, living like
an orphan with his aunt Effie.

262
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:11,918
Bear up, old girl. You'll
be near at hand now for Michael.

263
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:15,238
Your wife has shamed you both.

264
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:17,838
All of us.

265
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,499
You'll divorce?

266
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,878
No, only a blagger
would submit his wife to that.

267
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:37,317
Mrs Satterthwaite established
herself at a German spa,

268
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:41,078
so that it may be said that Sylvia
has gone abroad to nurse her.

269
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,598
The mother's a bitch
but a sensible one.

270
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:52,318
The motor-plough didn't serve.

271
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,989
It's all coming.

272
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:25,997
He's someone called Thurston,
I met him somewhere. He won't gossip.

273
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:28,437
I don't care if he does.

274
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:33,797
- Well, thank you very much.
- What does it matter? Now or later.

275
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,918
We're not going to hide for ever.

276
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,278
- Well, that's the thing, Potty.
- What thing?

277
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,878
It's not for ever.

278
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,933
Yes, it is.

279
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:53,038
- I hope you're not going to behave badly.
- About what?

280
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,566
About my going back,
before it's too late.

281
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:02,075
Oh, no, you're not.
What are you talking about?

282
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,117
- I miss my husband.
- No, you don't!

283
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:09,674
- You call him... a great lump of wood.
- Oh, he is.

284
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:13,396
I often want to kill him just to see
if there's any blood in him.

285
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,997
I'm permanently angry with him.

286
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:19,277
But he's spoiled me for any other
decently groomed man in London.

287
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,797
He knows everything about everything.

288
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,157
That's the difference between being
with a grown man

289
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:26,238
and trying to entertain a schoolboy.

290
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,678
But you love me.

291
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:32,718
Don't you?

292
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,837
Er... I overlooked you.

293
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:40,917
Your dullness, and not knowing French
and drinking too much or too little

294
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:45,397
and oh, I don't know, everything really,
from being all over me

295
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:49,077
the moment we were on the train
to sulking if I'm not all over you.

296
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,717
Especially that side of things.

297
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:55,958
Which became like reading a book
you've read before.

298
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:03,918
Why can't one get a man to go away
with one and be just... light comedy?

299
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:08,398
I say, you're not going to kill yourself,
I hope, Potty.

300
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:15,438
I want you to swear on your
St Anthony that you won't leave me.

301
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:19,558
- I'll do no such thing.
- Then I'll kill you if you try.

302
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,437
The French understand these things.

303
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:28,598
These hotels one has been staying in,
the notepaper is simply shaming.

304
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:40,797
A weekend on the golf links
might do me some good,

305
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,358
hobnobbing with our masters.

306
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,597
I will change into my golfing togs
when we get to our digs.

307
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:50,397
One never knows who might
be on the train.

308
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:54,838
Mr Sandbach MP,
going down to his constituency...

309
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:01,078
Ah!

310
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:05,998
The proofs of my monograph.

311
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,598
Sylvia asks me to take her back.

312
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:26,398
She's joined her mother in Germany.

313
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,038
- Will you take her back?
- I imagine so.

314
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:38,317
There's the child to consider.

315
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,517
Marchant says he's...

316
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:43,078
beginning to talk like a farmer's
boy already.

317
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,797
Well, I shan't have a house again.

318
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:52,438
There's a certain discredit attaches
to itself to a cuckold, quite properly.

319
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:56,877
Anything beyond a flat looks like
impudence in a man

320
00:25:56,878 --> 00:25:58,998
who can't keep his wife.

321
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:08,317
I wish you'd divorce her.
Drag her through the mud.

322
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,958
For a gentleman,
there's such a thing as...

323
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,438
- Call it parade.
- And if you met someone you want to marry?

324
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,321
It would change nothing.
I stand for monogamy.

325
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:25,038
- You...
- Aye, monogamy and chastity.

326
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,078
And for not talking about it.

327
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:43,478
"Better far tho hearts may break
Bid farewell for aye!

328
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:50,278
"Lest thy sad eyes meeting mine
Tempt my soul away."

329
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,318
That's great poetry.

330
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:59,237
That's your obese poet painter
talking about it in language

331
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:01,478
like congealed bacon fat.

332
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:07,117
- You have a way of putting things.
- No, I haven't.

333
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:09,958
If I had, it would make it better for me.
Here.

334
00:27:11,438 --> 00:27:16,237
"Accept resumption yoke on condition
child stay with sister Effie and Anglican.

335
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,838
"Wire if acceptable."

336
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,438
I for one am sorry.

337
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:29,958
- She must have a way of putting things.
- She has.

338
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,957
"I am now ready to return to you,
if I can keep Hullo Central,

339
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,877
"there being no-one else
I can bear to have near me,

340
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:43,358
"when I have retired for the night."
That's all.

341
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,757
She should be the consort of the...
I don't know,

342
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:53,718
of the Viceroy of India.

343
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:04,997
We'll get in a round of golf today.

344
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:08,997
Tomorrow a breakfasting with the
rector who'd helped me with my book.

345
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:10,997
But of course he did.

346
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:14,717
You mean the Reverend Duchemin who hosted
those famous breakfasts at Cambridge?

347
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:18,317
He's no longer at Cambridge.
He has a rectory near Rye.

348
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:19,518
Oh.

349
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:29,358
Lady Claudine says come and pick a
bone at Mountby. You too, Macmaster.

350
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:34,317
Thank you, I won't.
Macmaster would be delighted.

351
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,357
You're the great Macmaster?

352
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,477
That's very good of you to say,
Mr Sandbach.

353
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:43,036
- The caddie heard tell.
- Plus one at North Berwick.

354
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:48,318
Oh, good God.
Is that Waterhouse up ahead?

355
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:04,678
Mm.

356
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,918
Hm!

357
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:15,718
Get Chrissie back to Sylvia
as quick as you can.

358
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:22,157
Believe me, Sylvia is a splendid girl.
Straight as a die.

359
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:24,118
Takes her fences clean.

360
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:28,814
Chrissie must have been
running after the skirts.

361
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,341
- No?
- No.

362
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,717
- I dare say a little... No?
- No!

363
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:35,117
It will be resented.

364
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:39,158
Half the houses in London would be
closed to him, so do what you can.

365
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:52,957
Hooked it.

366
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,437
I loathe this game.

367
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:58,117
Why do you play, then?

368
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:59,798
Macmaster has no-one else.

369
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,318
Votes for women!

370
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,757
- Oi! Come here, you!
- Votes for women!

371
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:32,878
Is it our blood you want
before you give in?

372
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:38,357
Stop! Stop! Stop where you are!

373
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,518
Votes for women! Votes for women!
Run, Gertie!

374
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:47,318
(SHRILL WHISTLE)

375
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,598
By jove! Miss Wannop!

376
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,878
Suffragettes.

377
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,558
Get off!

378
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,677
You're under arrest!

379
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:04,718
Valentine!

380
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,558
I say, sorry to spoil your shot.

381
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:17,437
Go and see that they don't hurt Gertie.
I've lost her.

382
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:20,037
(DISTANT COMMOTION)

383
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,677
You've been demonstrating.

384
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:24,957
Well, of course, we have, but you
won't see a girl be manhandled.

385
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:29,037
There looked to be some beasts
among them - a regular rat-hunt -

386
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:30,157
and Gertie can't run.

387
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:33,718
You cut away, then.
I'll look after Gertie.

388
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:39,077
- No, I'll come with you.
- Clear out, unless you want to go to gaol.

389
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,717
- Tally-ho!
- Help!

390
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:41,718
Run!

391
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,397
Strip the bitch naked!
Strip the bitch!

392
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,078
- Stark naked!
- Stop!

393
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:54,478
Stop! Stop! Stop!

394
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,998
You couldn't have done more,
Officer.

395
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:03,518
I expect you're a bit shaken.

396
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,597
Anybody would be.

397
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,198
Thank you, sir.

398
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,158
Run, Gertie!

399
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,718
We've got them! We've got them!

400
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,678
You'll have to go round
by Camber railway bridge!

401
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:45,878
Idiot!

402
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,717
I refuse to play with you.

403
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:52,997
In fact, I've a good mind to issue a warrant
for your arrest, for obstructing justice.

404
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:55,998
You can't. You're not a borough magistrate.
Look it up.

405
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:01,957
Chrissie, you are the bloody limit!

406
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:05,398
The bobby didn't want to arrest the girls.
He was yearning not to.

407
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:13,077
Was that girl your... a friend of yours?
Had you arranged it with her?

408
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:16,957
If it was the Wannop girl -
if the woman that's come between you

409
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,517
and Sylvia, dammit,
is our little suffragette...

410
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:22,157
- Good God!
- Put her back, Chrissie.

411
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:23,358
I give you my word.

412
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:27,398
They say they're all whores.

413
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,637
I beg your pardon,
if you like the Wannop girl.

414
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,077
Her father was a great friend
of your father's.

415
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:42,718
Of course, I remember...
Professor Wannop, the classicist.

416
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,157
He didn't leave a farthing
and there's a son at Eton.

417
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:51,357
The widow and daughter
have a deuced hard row to hoe.

418
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:55,518
I know Claudine takes them all the peaches
she can cadge out of Paul's gardener.

419
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,037
Perhaps you feel sorry for her,
is that it?

420
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,837
I think that's enough confusion
to be going on with.

421
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:06,437
But you should know Mrs Satterthwaite
is much recovered at her German spa

422
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:10,129
and I'm expecting to go over in a day or two
to bring Sylvia and her mother home.

423
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,902
Good boy!

424
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:20,518
Kiss her fingertips for me.
She's the real thing, you lucky beggar.

425
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,997
<i>The littleness of it...</i>

426
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:43,437
our drawing-room comedy
of sex-obsession!

427
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:46,437
When the war comes,
it'll blow right through it, thank God!

428
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,037
War is impossible,

429
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,437
at any rate with this country in it.

430
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,477
Is that what they said
at your dinner with the Tories?

431
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:55,837
In two years, round about
grouse-shooting time,

432
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,879
there'll be a European war,
with Britain plumb in the middle of it.

433
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:00,275
Ah, the Tietjens exactitude!

434
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:04,678
- Where's your evidence?
- In the office.

435
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,077
It's late.

436
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:09,837
We're expected
at the Duchemin's breakfast -

437
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,957
if you haven't been arrested.

438
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:15,077
(THEY LAUGH)

439
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:18,917
I gave the policeman a £5 note from
that swine of a Cabinet Minister,

440
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,477
though I shouldn't call him that,
he gave me dinner.

441
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,398
Besides which, he's a decent fellow.

442
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:26,957
So it's hands off the Wannop girl.

443
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,237
The fair one -
Miss Valentine Wannop,

444
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:32,997
holder of the quarter-mile,
half-mile,

445
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,717
high jump and long jump records
for East Sussex,

446
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,437
and housemaid-typewriter
for her mother, the novelist.

447
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,237
The other one's not local,
probably London.

448
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:46,038
Never underestimate
the Sussex constabulary.

449
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,838
Oh, and it is generally believed that
Miss Wannop and I are in cahoots, if not worse.

450
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,398
Why do you look like that?

451
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:05,118
Because I'm waiting for my wife
to wire me to fetch her home.

452
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,958
And this is what I look like.

453
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:22,357
There are times when a woman hates a man,
even a very good man,

454
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,397
as my husband was.

455
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:27,917
I have walked behind a man's back
and nearly screamed with

456
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:31,157
the desire to sink my nails
into the veins of his neck.

457
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,277
And Sylvia's got it worse than I.

458
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:37,340
If the woman, as the Church directs,
would have children and live decent.

459
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,522
- But Sylvia's had a child.
- Whose?!

460
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:44,517
- That blaggard Drake's, wasn't it?
- It was probably Drake's.

461
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:46,597
I am here, you know!

462
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,478
I am done with men.

463
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:52,997
Think of all the ruin
that child has meant for me.

464
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:55,157
And Christopher's
perfectly soppy about it.

465
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,157
You don't deserve your husband,
anyway.

466
00:36:57,158 --> 00:37:00,637
I can't imagine
why he sent that telegram.

467
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:01,917
Resume yoke, indeed!

468
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:09,157
He sent it out of lordly, dull, full-dress
consideration that drives me distracted.

469
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:14,197
He couldn't write me a letter, because he'd
have to put "Dear Sylvia" - and I'm not.

470
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,837
He's that precise sort of imbecile.

471
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,517
I'll settle down by his side
and I'll be chaste.

472
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:26,357
I've made up my mind to it.
I'll be bored stiff for the rest of my life,

473
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,158
except for one thing - I can torment that man
and I'll do it, for all the times he's tormented me.

474
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:39,158
I've come from Normandy
without sleep, you see.

475
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:49,877
Oh! I'll tell them downstairs
to simply telegraph Christopher,

476
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:51,438
"Righto".

477
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:03,437
I'll send the Reverend Duchemin
a signed copy of my book.

478
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:05,237
His word still carries weight.

479
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:10,837
Of course, sucking up to Duchemin was always
the price for kedgeree and poached eggs!

480
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,838
(BELL TINKLES)

481
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:16,398
Welcome! Welcome!

482
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:19,877
I'm the curate here!

483
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:21,358
Oh, Good Lord.

484
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:30,037
Thank you, thank you!

485
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:34,157
Ups-a-daisy. My name's Horsley.

486
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:36,478
- Macmaster.
- Where did you get this job lot?

487
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,157
Gosh, don't you know you've got a 13 hands
pony harness on a 16 and a half hands horse?

488
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:45,998
Let the bit out three holes.
It's tearing the animal's tongue in half.

489
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:50,745
I'm not sure it's playing the game,
Valentine, asking you to be here.

490
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,107
If your mother knew...

491
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,237
Mother wanted to come with me when
I told her it was to meet a critic,

492
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:57,718
but I got away in the carriage.

493
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:02,558
That's perfect.
Nobody will even see your husband.

494
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:07,169
I've told Duchemin's keeper
to keep him out till a quarter past.

495
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:10,046
I've set a place for your Gertie,
but never mind.

496
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,083
We've got the old curate's sister staying with us,
Miss Fox, and she's stone deaf!

497
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:16,420
An empty chair next to her
makes no difference.

498
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,381
This way!

499
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:23,357
The ladies will be in here!
We arrived together! He-he!

500
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,437
Miss... Good morning. I'm Macmaster.

501
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:30,917
We're living in a state of siege, ladies.
Tee-hee!

502
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,157
It's so good of you to come.

503
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:35,037
Pleasure, thank you for having me.
Christopher Tietjens.

504
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:38,677
A pleasure indeed and you must be
the famous Vincent Macmaster.

505
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:42,317
- Mr Sandbach MP and half a dozen...
- A pleasure, ma'am.

506
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:45,117
- I'm Edith Duchemin and this is Miss Wannop!
- Ah, Miss Wannop!

507
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:47,357
And armed with loaded canes...

508
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,437
Gentlemen, you must be tired from your journey.
Allow me to show you to your seats.

509
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,717
- Scouring the country lanes, tee-hee!
- Thank you.

510
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,761
- You are here Mr Tietjens, I thought.
- Thank you.

511
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:59,797
And here, for you, Mr Macmaster.
And I next to you!

512
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,117
Drink had been taken!

513
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:06,477
If you are hungry, there's...
Well, I hope you'll find something to your liking.

514
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:11,437
- Thank you.
- Is said to have egged them on.

515
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:15,637
He's putting up at Lady Claudine's
for Royal duties at Dover.

516
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:19,237
- Campion is taking the escort...
- I must thank you for yesterday.

517
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:23,223
The Buffs' colours on the altar
of St Peter's tomorrow morning.

518
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,922
Ah, Mrs Wannop, what a pleasant surprise!

519
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,623
- Mother?!
- Which is Mr Macmaster, the critic?

520
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:36,317
- Are you Mr Macmaster, the critic?
- I am Macmaster.

521
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:42,637
Oh, Mr Macmaster, my new book
is coming out on Tuesday...

522
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,757
Mother,
what have you done with Gertie?

523
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:48,597
She's lying low in the attic...
High, rather.

524
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:53,437
It will be of interest to you
to hear about my book.

525
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:56,797
To you journalists, a little
inside information is always...

526
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,437
I'm not a journalist!

527
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:01,825
- Well, a critic.
- I don't review books.-

528
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,397
- I'm not a critic in the sense of...
- Of course you are.

529
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,077
I write for
the critical quarterlies.

530
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:11,557
- Mr Macmaster...
- Oh, the critical quarterlies!

531
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:17,197
Mr Horsley, sit Mrs Wannop
next to you and feed her!

532
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:21,637
That is exactly what my book needs -
a good, long, deep...

533
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:24,997
- Ups-a-daisy.
- That's the Reverend's chair.

534
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:28,003
The critical quarterlies have shown
a deplorable lack of interest -

535
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:31,455
- serious interest...
- That's better.

536
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:38,859
- Would you allow me to help you to...?
- Oh, a little caviar. A peach!

537
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:46,157
I'm afraid I... I'm afraid I must...
You see, my husband...

538
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:49,077
I beg you, dear lady,
do not concern yourself.

539
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:54,397
I think this party's very badly arranged.
Very bad management.

540
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:56,547
Or perhaps not.
Sometimes you'd never know he was...

541
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,144
One understands.

542
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:03,317
Only to spend a fleeting hour
in these perfect surroundings.

543
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,157
You know the lines,
"As when the swallow

544
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,037
"gliding from lofty portal
to lofty portal,

545
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:12,677
"out of the dark and into the light
and out again into the dark"?

546
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:17,437
- Oh, yes! Yes! It takes a poet!
- I have a message for you, from Mr Waterhouse.

547
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:20,148
I told him I did not know you
and did not expect to see you.

548
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,921
He didn't believe me.

549
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,077
If it's to invite me for a chat,

550
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:28,037
I don't intend to place myself
in the way of his condescension.

551
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:31,877
No, not that. He wants you to know that
there are no charges against you.

552
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:34,437
Well, what about Gertie?

553
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:37,289
Gertie, too,
as far as yesterday is concerned,

554
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,527
but I'd get her out from your attic,
if she's on the run from the Metropolitan Police,

555
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:43,159
which she is.

556
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:01,717
Parry?

557
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:05,957
Good God, it's Parry,
the Bermondsey light-middleweight!

558
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,837
Mr Macmaster seems to know him, too.

559
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,318
He taught me to box at Cambridge.

560
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,638
Good morning... Doctor.

561
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,037
I- I'm not a doctor.

562
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:26,997
Yes... Yes.

563
00:43:26,998 --> 00:43:32,078
The stethoscope packed in the hat
left in the hall.

564
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,237
And your friend? Another medical man?

565
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:40,877
It takes two doctors, of course,

566
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:44,477
to certify a lunatic. Ah, Parry.

567
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:48,277
Sole fillets - very good!
Kidneys to follow.

568
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:49,278
Very good, sir.

569
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,317
I am Macmaster.

570
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,158
We corresponded
and you invited me for breakfast.

571
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,557
Of course I did!

572
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:00,278
Macmaster, the budding critic!

573
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:03,117
And friend.

574
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:07,677
Macmaster and friend to breakfast!

575
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,118
Not medical men.

576
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:14,994
But you look tired.

577
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:17,778
Worn.

578
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,158
Worn out.

579
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,358
I detect the pallor of self-abuse.

580
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:30,837
Don't turn round.
Vincent Macmaster is quite capable.

581
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:33,997
Post coitum tristia.
Ah, the sorrows of spent semen!

582
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:36,917
Boys or girls, in your case?

583
00:44:36,918 --> 00:44:39,637
Sir, your fish is getting cold!
I'll bring the kidneys!

584
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:42,424
If he'll eat a little - it brings
the blood down from the head.

585
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:43,645
Oh, forgive!

586
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,157
It's dreadful for you.

587
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:49,088
My dear lady, please don't worry,
it's what I'm for.

588
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:50,696
Oh, you good man.

Of course! The daughter of Professor
Wannop would know her Latin!

591
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:04,797
I can stop this. Shall I?

592

Yes. Yes, anything!

Marcus Valerius Martialis,

00:45:09,518 --> 00:45:13,597
the lament of the wife
of a boy-buggerer -

"My dear, I have an arsehole too!"

596
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:21,837
Get him out - the way you beat
Kid Cantor at Hackney Baths!

597
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,997
I have often had to refer my wife
to Marcus 11, 43.

598
00:45:25,998 --> 00:45:30,558
"Alas, my dear, with women, it's more
a case of having two cu..." Ugh!

599
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:35,798
You all right, sir?
It's time to write your sermon sir.

600
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,158
Ready? There we go.

601
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:45,597
Dearest lady, it's all over now.
I assure you.

602
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:49,198
Please forgive!
You can never respect me?

603
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:52,078
You're the bravest woman I know.

(BICYCLE BELLS RINGS)
Goodbye!

605
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:14,517
This isn't the rig for you,
Mrs Wannop.

606
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:19,077
A pony and basketwork chaise,
that's the trap for ladies.

607
00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:20,797
But she'll do well for
the work tonight.

608
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,717
Tonight?

609
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:25,277
Mr Tietjens means Gertie. Don't you?

610
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:29,557
Yes. Do you know somewhere Gertie
can wait it out?

611
00:46:29,558 --> 00:46:31,997
They'll be watching
the trains at Ashford Junction.

612
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,757
- Oh, you'll help?
- I will not see you incommoded.

613
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,077
You've written the only
novel since the 18th century

614
00:46:37,078 --> 00:46:38,797
I've not had to correct
in the margins.

615
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,757
Well!

616

But what shall we do with Gertie?

Bring her over, only don't pull
at her mouth, she'll come easy.

Oh, he is a beast! You don't know
when he's not talking about Gertie.

- I'll miss you, Gertie.
- See you in London.

She'll be all right.

You should know, Miss Wannop,
we are being talked about.

And that'll teach you not to speak
to strange men on golf courses.

It doesn't matter.
It really doesn't matter.

The only thing that matters
is to do good work.

It's true. I oughtn't to care what
those swines say about me,

00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,878
something like Uddlemere.

And we are on the road to Uddlemere.

Do you mind telling me
if you know this road at all?

It's Udimore, not Uddlemere.

I'm so happy.

The next crossroad
is Grandfather's Wantways.

An old gentleman used to sit there
called Gran'fer Finn.

Tenterden market
was abolished in 1845.

Because you do.

were all in museums.

and letting the country go to hell.

We're nearly home.

674
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:42,757
I found a milestone,
we're just above Mountby.

675
00:51:42,758 --> 00:51:44,598
You can go on now.

676
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:47,157
Walk on.

677
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:51,197
The Mountby drive is 100 yards.
Just... pull to the left

678
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:53,518
or the horse will walk
straight up to the house.

679
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,158
And, look, the sun.

680
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:07,837
It's the beginning of the longest day,
the summer solstice.

681
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,958
Sistere and sol, because the sun
seems to stand still.

682
00:52:16,598 --> 00:52:18,277
We got through the night.

683
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:19,638
Miss Wannop...

684
00:52:23,438 --> 00:52:25,558
Damn Mountby.

685
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:31,878
My dear,
couldn't have lasted forever.

686
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:34,958
But you're a good man.

687
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,478
Very clever.

688
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:41,918

Whoa, whoa.

693
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:01,278
Good girl.

694
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:08,477
She's cut badly, come quick.

695
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,918
Red stocking from
the flank downwards.

696
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:15,238
Take off your petticoat.

697
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:19,118
Tear it into strips.
We need it for bandages.

698
00:53:21,038 --> 00:53:22,198
Jump the hedge.

699
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:24,998
I've seen you jump.

700
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:41,557
Damn you! Go away! I went past
to get you out of Claudine's sight.

701
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:44,557
- You'll have to pay for the horse.
- Why should I?

702
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,477
For not sounding your horn.

703
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:50,157
You drove right into my drive!
Besides,

704
00:53:50,158 --> 00:53:51,478
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

705
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:06,397
What am I to tell my sister?
I believe she saw the girl.

706
00:54:06,398 --> 00:54:09,357
Go away. Tell her what you like,
but you'll pay for her horse.

707
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:10,677
I'm damned if I will.

708
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:13,597
And send out the horse ambulance
when you go through Rye.

709
00:54:13,598 --> 00:54:14,998
There's your sister getting out.

710
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,877
Nobody's dead.
Who was that with Tietjens?

711
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:23,798
Never you mind.
Get in the car, we'll be late.

712
00:54:32,558 --> 00:54:35,798
Why did you try to quarrel
with the general?

713
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:38,677
You need a quarrel with him,

714
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:41,398
it'll account for Lady Claudine
spreading slander.

715
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:45,917
You think of everything

716
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:48,638
when most men wouldn't be
able to think at all.

717
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:54,118
Tell me about Groby.

718
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,798
It's older than Protestantism...

719
00:55:02,158 --> 00:55:07,077
And Groby Great Tree is the symbol
of the Yorkshire Tietjens.

720
00:55:07,078 --> 00:55:08,638
It's a big cedar.

721
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:14,077
The crown darkens our topmost windows,
and the roots undermine our foundations.

722
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,798
So one of them will have to go.

723
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:21,038
House or tree, one day.

724
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:28,118
If I ever take you there...

725
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:33,998
My dear...

726
00:55:35,638 --> 00:55:37,398
You'll never take me to Groby.

727
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:49,317
It's the postmaster's boy.

728
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:51,917
And he can take you home.

729
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:55,397
It's been perhaps
a short acquaintance,

730
00:55:55,398 --> 00:55:58,438
but I think you're
the splendidest...

731
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:10,157
Whoa! Whoa! You, there.

732
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,478
You, stop there.

733
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:18,917
Good morning, Jimmy.

734
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:22,558
Morning, Miss Wannop.
I was just on my way to your cottage.

735
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:27,558
There's a telegram re-directed care of Wannop.
It must be Macmaster.

736
00:56:29,118 --> 00:56:32,197
You're to take Miss Wannop home.

737
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,478
She's her mother's breakfast
to see to.

738
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:42,958
Go on.

739
00:57:06,278 --> 00:57:08,478
Damn near forty miles in one night.

740
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:12,398
You've lost a lot of blood.

741
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:16,638
I let you down, old girl, didn't I?

Oh, that's my first suffragette.

746
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:07,677
I know what it is that makes a man

747
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:09,717
want to go away
with a woman he likes.

748
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:11,758
Oh, go away,
if you can't bear to look.

749
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:14,997
But that desire

750
00:58:14,998 --> 00:58:16,638
must be resisted.

751
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,557
Don't touch me now
when it's too late.

752
00:58:20,558 --> 00:58:22,597
You have something to live for.

753
00:58:22,598 --> 00:58:24,757
- Don't you want to be a man of influence?
- No.

754
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:26,198
I'd prefer to be in the trenches.
