ONLY DEFEAT, ANXIETY,

RIDICULOUS ATTEMPT TO STAGE A

00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:08,568
IN FACT, THE REVOLUTIONARIES

122
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,472
HAD BEEN DISPERSED BY POLICE FIRE

123
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,908
AS THEY LEFT THE CELLAR,

124
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:15,932

00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,289
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,

132
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,256
HITLER WOULD CALL IT "THE FLAG OF MARTYRS"

133
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,778
AND USE IT TO INSPIRE

00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,475
IF...THEY THOUGHT OF HIM AT ALL.

187
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:50,268
BUT IN LESS THAN THREE MONTHS,

188
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:55,006
WALL STREET WOULD CRASH...

189
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,750
AND TAKE THE GERMAN ECONOMY

190
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,285
DOWN WITH IT.

191
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:04,680
AND WITHIN A YEAR, THE NAZIS

192
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,714
WOULD BE ONE OF THE LARGEST

193
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:10,084
POLITICAL PARTIES IN GERMANY.

194

196

ANXIOUSLY FOR A SAVIOR,

197
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,967
HE EMERGED LIKE A MOUNTAIN.

198
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,806
COLUMNS MARCH...

199
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,143
DRUMS BEAT...

200
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,689
AND 100,000 MEN STAND

201
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:45,713
FIRMLY GATHERED AROUND ONE MAN.

202
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,607
NOW BUILD UP YOUR PEOPLE, OH MASTER,

203
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,770
A NEW, GREAT FATHERLAND AWAITS.

205
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:31,234
THIS FOOTAGE WAS RECORDED AT A

206
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:33,670
CARNIVAL NEAR LEIPZIG, GERMANY.

207
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,972
FILMMAKER WALTER LENGER BROUGHT

208
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,408
HIS 16mm CAMERA AND THE

209
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:41,310
GIRL HE WOULD MARRY.

210
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:48,699
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS JOYFUL...

211
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:54,656
BUT BEYOND THESE CARNIVAL GATES...

212
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,449
THERE WERE CALLS FOR REVOLUTION.

213
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,920
IF YOU WERE GERMAN,

214
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,029
AND YOU WANTED CHANGE,

215
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:10,607
YOU HAD TWO CHOICES:

216
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:12,676
EITHER YOU JOINED THE GROWING

217
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:17,087
NUMBERS OF COMMUNISTS, OR,

218
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,409
LIKE WALTER LENGER,

219
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,251
YOU JOINED THE NAZI PARTY.

220
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:39,036
THE GREAT DEPRESSION WAS IN ITS

221
00:16:39,071 --> 00:16:41,049
THIRD YEAR...

222
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:48,412
AND GERMANY HAD SUFFERED AS MUCH

223
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:51,393
AS ANY COUNTRY.

224

BREAD, WITHOUT THE HOPE THAT HIS

LOT IN LIFE WILL CHANGE.

230
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:13,771

OFFICE--THE GERMAN PRESIDENCY.

239
00:18:55,107 --> 00:18:57,909
IF YOU OPPOSED THE NAZIS, YOU

240
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:01,579
WERE SURE THAT THIS WAS THE END

241
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:05,650
OF HITLER.

MOVEMENT THAT HAS GATHERED

245
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:10,922
AROUND HIM.

246
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,028
BESIDES, FOR ORDINARY GERMANS,

247
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:19,797
HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS

248
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:24,836
THOROUGHLY REPELLENT--

249
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:28,673
THE EPILEPTIC BEHAVIOR, THE WILD

250
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,842
GESTICULATIONS AND FOAMING AT

251
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,579
THE MOUTH, THE ALTERNATELY

SHIFTY AND STARING EYES.

MOST OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEGUN TO

254
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:44,856
ACCLAIM HITLER WOULD PROBABLY

255
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:47,225
AVOID ASKING HIM FOR A LIGHT IF

256
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,493
THEY MET HIM IN THE STREET.

1933.

262
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,396
ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NEVER CAPTURED

MORE THAN 37% OF THE POPULAR

264
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:30,601

00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,737
LARGEST POLITICAL PARTY IN

266
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:36,841
GERMANY.

267
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:41,579
AND SO GERMAN LEADERS INSTALLED

268
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:44,783
HITLER AS CHANCELLOR.

269
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:06,305
AS MANY AS 20 MILLION PEOPLE

270
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:09,775

AFTER THIS SPEECH, NAZI PARTY

274
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,483
OFFICES WERE FLOODED WITH SO

275
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,719
MANY MEMBERSHIP REQUESTS THEY

276
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:37,290
HAD TO SUSPEND ADMISSIONS.

277
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:40,927
EVEN SO, HITLER DID NOT YET

278
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:44,664
CONTROL GERMANY.

279
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:48,001

IF YOU LIVED IN BERLIN...

YOU AWOKE TO THIS:

284
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:39,703
DURING THE NIGHT SOMEONE HAD SET

285
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:43,239
FIRE TO GERMANY'S PARLIAMENT.

286
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:49,244
>> Ebermayer: JUST NOW, THE

287
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,681
REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN IN EARNEST.

288
00:24:55,418 --> 00:24:57,086
THE MIDDLE CLASS HAD BEEN

289
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,888
REPELLED BY THE ROUGHNESS AND

290
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:00,989
LACK OF POLISH BY THE NAZIS.

291
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:09,430
NOW THEY'VE BEEN FRIGHTENED AND

292
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:11,700
WON OVER BY THE REICHSTAG FIRE.

293

IS CERTAIN WHO SET THE FIRE THAT

295
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:32,151
DESTROYED THE REICHSTAG.

296
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:34,053
BUT HITLER KNEW WHO HE WOULD

297
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:38,624
BLAME--HIS RIVALS,

298
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:40,992
THE COMMUNISTS.

299
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,702
THE NAZI PRESS SAID THAT THE

300
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,071
REICHSTAG FIRE WAS INTENDED AS A

301
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:55,606
SIGNAL FOR COMMUNIST CELLS

302
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:59,210
ACROSS GERMANY TO RISE UP AND

303
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:01,779
REVOLT.

COMMIT MURDER AND PLUNDER.

307
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:11,254
HOSTAGES WOULD BE TAKEN FROM THE

MIDDLE CLASS.

WIVES AND CHILDREN OF POLICE

310
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:19,963
OFFICERS USED AS HUMAN SHIELDS.

314
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:35,977
A COMMUNIST THREAT.

315
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,213
NOW HE WOULD USE IT TO CRUSH HIS

316
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:40,314
OPPOSITION.

MATTERS WITH A FEW FRIENDS.

320
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:10,475
ALL OF THEM ARE VERY INTERESTED

321
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,877
IN THE QUESTION OF WHO REALLY

322
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:14,413
STARTED THE FIRE, AND MORE THAN

323
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,314
ONE OF THEM HINTED THAT THEY HAD

324
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:20,852
DOUBTS ABOUT THE OFFICIAL STORY.

325
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,120

THAT FROM NOW ON THEIR

327
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:27,959
TELEPHONES WOULD BE TAPPED,

328

THEIR LETTERS OPENED, AND THEIR

329
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,763

CHANGES WERE HAPPENING ACROSS

332

GERMANY, BUT HITLER HAD

333
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:12,132
JUSTIFIED THEM ALL.

BUT WE MUST CLEAN UP.

338
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:24,116

VIOLENCE, BREACHES OF THE LAW,

346
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:09,286
BARBARIC OPINIONS; APPEAR QUITE

UNDISGUISED AS OFFICIAL DECREE.

348
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:17,294

CELEBRATED HIS WEDDING

744
01:05:24,141 --> 01:05:26,543
BY MAKING THIS SHORT FILM.

745
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:39,106
LENGER AND HIS BRIDE WERE

746
01:05:39,175 --> 01:05:41,176
EXACTLY THE KIND OF GERMANS

747
01:05:41,214 --> 01:05:43,781
HITLER WANTED MORE OF--

748
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:48,361
INDUSTRIOUS,  POLITICALLY ENTHUSIASTIC,

749
01:05:48,363 --> 01:05:50,515
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...

750
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,969
ARYAN.

751
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:59,752
WOMEN LIKE MRS. LENGER WERE

752
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,090
ENCOURAGED BY THE REICH TO HAVE

753
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,826
AS MANY CHILDREN AS POSSIBLE.

754
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:09,517
BECAUSE, IF THE THIRD REICH

755
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,257
WAS GOING TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS,

756
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,951
IT DIDN'T JUST NEED BETTER GERMANS.

757
01:06:15,022 --> 01:06:17,424

THAT IF HER MOTHER DID NOT

789

GO HOME AND LEAVE HER ALONE,

790
01:08:19,571 --> 01:08:21,196
SHE WOULD REPORT HER TO THE

REPORT THE MOTHER TO THE GESTAPO,

922
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,839
TO GET OUT, I HAD TO PAY NEXT

923
01:20:10,841 --> 01:20:14,123
YEAR'S TAXES IN ADVANCE,

924
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:17,008
EVEN THOUGH I WILL NOT BE IN GERMANY

925
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,990
AT ALL.

926
01:20:20,171 --> 01:20:24,944
BUT NO PRICE IS TOO MUCH.

927
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:27,344
THIS IS A COUNTRY TO GET OUT OF...

928
01:20:27,376 --> 01:20:30,445
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT NAKED.

929
01:21:05,682 --> 01:21:07,789
>> Narrator: IT WAS THE 26th OF SEPTEMBER,

930
01:21:09,606 --> 01:21:11,630
AND THE ANNUAL OKTOBERFEST

931
01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:14,429
IN MUNICH WAS IN FULL SWING.

932
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,761
BUT IN A FEW MINUTES,

933
01:21:25,828 --> 01:21:27,803
HITLER HIMSELF

934
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:31,841
WOULD PUT AN END TO THE FESTIVITIES.

935
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:42,286
>> Pope: SUDDENLY,

936
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:44,145
THE ROLLER COASTERS STOP.

937
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:55,938
ON THE LOUDSPEAKERS, THE FUHRER

938
01:21:56,003 --> 01:21:58,409
IS RAGING AGAINST CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

939
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,948
NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A LARGE

940
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,542
CROWD CHANGE FROM ELATION TO GLOOM

941
01:22:07,606 --> 01:22:10,709
SO INSTANTANEOUSLY.

942
01:22:26,412 --> 01:22:28,447
>> Narrator: HITLER HAD DEMANDED

943
01:22:28,513 --> 01:22:30,815
THAT CZECHOSLOVAKIA CEDE A LARGE

944
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:32,715
PORTION OF ITS GERMAN-SPEAKING

945
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:35,616
TERRITORY TO THE THIRD REICH.

946
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,053
IF CZECHOSLOVAKIA REFUSED,

947
01:22:45,118 --> 01:22:47,954
GERMANY VOWED TO INVADE.

948
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:14,128
24 HOURS LATER, THE EVENING OF

949
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,362
SEPTEMBER 27th...

950
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:22,298
HERE IN BERLIN, GERMAN SOLDIERS

951
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,765
PREPARED FOR AN INVASION.

952
01:23:31,038 --> 01:23:34,034
IN ONLY A FEW HOURS, THEY WOULD

953
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:37,055
ROLL TO THE CZECHOSLOVAKIAN BORDER.

954
01:23:42,903 --> 01:23:44,837
>> Andreas-Friedrich: HAVE THE PEOPLE

955
01:23:44,904 --> 01:23:47,205
ANY IDEA WHAT THEY ARE

956
01:23:47,271 --> 01:23:48,604
BEING FORCED INTO?

957
01:23:54,423 --> 01:23:57,718
NO, I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT.

958
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:03,443
WE WANT PEACE.

959
01:24:03,476 --> 01:24:07,045
AND TOMORROW, THERE WILL BE WAR.

960
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,258
>> Fromm: SAFE ABOARD THIS

961
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,290
GORGEOUS BOAT.

962
01:24:33,293 --> 01:24:35,853
IT IS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR ME TO BELIEVE.

963
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,746
THEN, WHEN I DO BECOME ACUTELY

964
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:43,563
AWARE OF MY GOOD FORTUNE,

965
01:24:43,563 --> 01:24:47,690
I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY, REMEMBERING

966
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:50,591
THE UNFORTUNATE ONES WHO WAIT,

967
01:24:50,656 --> 01:24:52,691
DESPERATELY HOPING FOR THEIR

968
01:24:52,724 --> 01:24:54,959
CHANCE TO GET OUT.

969
01:24:59,696 --> 01:25:01,094
>> Narrator: ON THE DAY BELLA FROMM

970
01:25:01,127 --> 01:25:03,567
SAILED FOR AMERICA,

971
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:06,142
THIS BABY GIRL WAS BORN IN THE TOWN

972
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:09,830
OF HALBERSTADT, OUTSIDE BERLIN.

973
01:25:14,724 --> 01:25:17,642
WIBKE KLAMROTH'S MOTHER AND FATHER 

974
01:25:17,644 --> 01:25:20,590
ARE ENTHUSIASTIC NAZIS,

975
01:25:22,546 --> 01:25:26,824
BUT IT IS ONLY SEPTEMBER OF 1938.

976
01:25:29,802 --> 01:25:33,438
THE THIRD REICH WILL LAST FOR

977
01:25:33,469 --> 01:25:35,604
ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS.

978
01:25:36,885 --> 01:25:40,540
AND IN THOSE SEVEN YEARS,

979
01:25:40,605 --> 01:25:43,908
HITLER WILL BETRAY...

980
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:48,443
IMPOVERISH...

981
01:25:48,508 --> 01:25:52,278
AND ULTIMATELY DESTROY

982
01:25:52,309 --> 01:25:54,543
THE KLAMROTH FAMILY...

983
01:26:01,112 --> 01:26:04,480
ALONG WITH THE REST OF GERMANY.
