- What?

159
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:50,646
The food they are forced to eat.
Watch these grains.

160

You're worse than a pit bull.
Never give up.

Can anyone say no?

167
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:12,644
We hope that in a war in France.
Good food, close to home.

168

end in a week.

I want to go to fashion.

170

Go! Without hesitation.
No way.

00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,689
Where you going?

181
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,141
(They speak in Kurdish)

182
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:33,310
(Shout in Kurdish)

183
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:43,267
- What happened? - Come on.
- At the base? - No. We are going to Iraq.

184
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,763
- For the brave Iraqis? - Yes
- Okay.

185
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,477
How are you?

186
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,019
What was the slaughter?

187
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,435
I can not endure
to make this work.

188
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,226
There 's a change of plans.
They attack the fort.

189
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,852
They want to share
a convoy of trucks.

190
00:16:02,148 --> 00:16:04,186
And you too? No!

191
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,304
- We have no choice. Bailamos.
- And we dance?

192
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,022
We have no choice?

193
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,311
Did you unzipped the brains?

194
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:16,345
Just another day, then another
and another! Do not take it anymore!

195
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,605
I'm going home.

196
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:26,560
David.

197
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:31,022
What makes you walk backwards?
Are 32 miles to the base.

198
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:36,478
Do not you understand?
Whatever.

199
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,769
(Mark), David!
(David) back home.

200
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,436
Wow! David!

201
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,143
(Male) Mr. Walsh! Come!

202
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:42,306
(Sound of water flowing)

203
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,096
(Dr. Talzani)) Mr. Walsh?

204
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,188
L 'have been found in the River.
Can you remember?

205
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,347
(They speak in Kurdish)

206
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:02,141
He says he can not walk.
Y 'as well?

207
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:06,887
I woke up.

208
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,305
- Does it hurt?
- (Mark complains).

209
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,179
- So, do you hear?
- Yes

210
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:20,307
No pain?

211
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:23,931
It can move your arms?

212
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,268
(Mark tries)

213
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:26,977
The legs?

214
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,353
(Mark tries)

215
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,099
Very good.

216
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:35,103
(Speaking in Kurdish)

217
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:37,394
Even a head injury?

218
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:46,430
Area E '. Perhaps a slight
emotion, but no fractures.

219
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,387
Kurdistan is not the ideal place
for a fractured skull.

220
00:18:50,648 --> 00:18:51,643
Therefore.

221
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:56,850
(Dr. Talzani)
Shot I was strong,

222
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:59,014
But he is not paralyzed.

223
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:01,430
There is no broken bone.

224
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,680
The legs are the problem
larger. And always.

225
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,563
Legs, legs, legs.

226
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,021
For each arm
I had to amputate

227
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:17,054
I amputee ... ten legs.
Strange, no?

228
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:21,474
The human legs are not created
for modern warfare.

229
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:31,105
Do not worry. Rest.

230
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,223
Do you have any problems neuronal

231
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,480
But Inshallah (thank goodness)
is only temporary.

232
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,480
I afloat.

233
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,678
(Please)

234
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,224
How do you feel?

235
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:44,223
Wow.

236
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,730
I was scared.

237
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:53,181
Best. A little pain.

238
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:58,387
Excellent. Pain
the numbness is preferable.

239
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,219
It's very fortunate.

240
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:03,519
If there are complications ...

241
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:06,688
(Mark) What? I would have killed?

242
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,559
Sure. For your own sake.

243
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,936
To end the suffering.

244
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:17,345
Where s your friend?
Do not come to see her.

245
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,763
I do not know I'm here.

246
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:25,273
When it came it was gone.

247
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,607
The first day of the offensive.

248
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:30,679
Smart man.

249
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,140
(Dr. Talzani) Men of War
believe they are immortal.

250
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:39,435
It is not good for morale to see
Cave Hara dying colleague.

251
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,012
(Grins)

252
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:45,686
I have not found another.
I hope you are well.

253
00:21:52,273 --> 00:21:54,940
(Far Cry)

254
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,013
(Far Cry)

255
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,564
(Far Cry)

256
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,688
Oh, Mr. Walsh.

257
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,429
Is progressing.

258
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:04,060
(Dr. Talzani) What do you think?

259
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:09,352
How many doctors are in the world,
have to clean a weapon?

260
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:13,731
- You should also sterile.
- Oh, the sarcasm is back.

261
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:15,522
(Dr. Talzani) Good.

262
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,182
You must have many regrets.

263
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,563
Remorse for what?

264
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,439
Because he saved me
days of excruciating pain?

265
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,513
As there was no way to save
or alleviate the tremendous pain of these?

266
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,103
Do you think that killing men
me joy?

267
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:44,314
Of course not.

268
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,312
During quieter

269
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:58,689
When there are many
the fight and I have more time

270
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,970
Little blue check code.

271
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:07,469
However, in critical moments,
many wounded who arrive, no.

272
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:13,181
I have to be alone
still be saved.

273
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,845
(Dr. Talzani), please.

274
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,436
Some live, some die.
The only way to see it.

275
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,434
Spa ((Thank you).

276
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:36,058
Everything else is just supposition.

277
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:40,771
Presumption Cards
you can change things.

278
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,644
Course, this is reprehensible
medical school.

279
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:51,723
Smoke in the operating room.

280
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,437
Tonight will be smooth.

281
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,728
You know what I mean Peshmerga?

282
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,265
This means:
Those who face death.

283
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:05,396
(Dr. Talzani) Romance.

284
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:08,814
Even poetic.

285
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:13,141
I do not always choose
face death.

286
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:15,685
(Dr. Talzani)
Limit to everyone.

287
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,222
There 's a van part
morning at the border.

288
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:28,477
Why?

289
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:30,557
Negotiated the offensive.

290
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:33,392
He's agreed to go,
so far.

291
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:49,643
(Dr. Talzani) Ready to start?

292
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,685
Yes.

293
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:55,432
It is much better.

294
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:59,057
I think it is yours.

295
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:01,140
(Mark), I do not.

296
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:06,642
I hope your stay
was nice.

297
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,723
A journey of a fable.

298
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:12,596
I do not understand why
there are more tourists here.

299
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:15,353
Sorry. E 'typical of us Kurds.

300
00:26:16,148 --> 00:26:19,845
It is a matter of honor insurance
that foreigners are happy.

301
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,144
I consider myself a satisfied customer.

302
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:24,890
Dr. Talzani!

303
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:27,932
Thanks, really.

304
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,638
The pleasure was mine, Mr. Walsh.
Good luck.

305
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:53,762
(Sound engine)

306
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:16,054
(Music slow)

307
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,689
(Sound of traffic)

308
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:27,060
Ah!

309
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:29,560
(Laughter)

310
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:30,810
Me.

311
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:33,230
(Mark)) Oh!

312
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:35,223
Piano, piano!

313
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:40,844
Ah! My God, what happened?

314
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:45,231
It was dark. I fell into a river
and hit me on the rocks.

315
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:48,148
Normal day in office.

316
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:50,804
Why not call
say again?

317
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,933
There was a coincidence
flight to Istanbul.

318
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:59,732
And this news? What hast thou done?

319
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:03,264
- You like it?
- Yes, I love it when purchased.

320
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:08,477
And suddenly do something
makes the place less evident.

321
00:29:08,732 --> 00:29:12,346
- You mean monastic?
- No, simple.

322
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:14,479
There was no place to sit.

323
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:19,479
- Set all back.
- No, the treasure. Scherzo.

324
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:22,350
I like it. In fact, no. But get used.

325
00:29:23,148 --> 00:29:26,845
- I'm a little tired.
- Come, we will prepare a bath.

326
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,304
Very good.

327
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:31,812
(Elena) Of course,
I like this new look.

328
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:40,518
Hello.

329
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:13,396
Oh, my God,

330
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:23,054
Mark.

331
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:27,184
Get up. Without drying, come.

332
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,265
Come on, baby.

333
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,848
I missed you.

334
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,099
Hello, sunshine.

335
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,853
I was devastated. Do not even remember
be outside the bathroom.

336
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:13,311
I love that happened?
You're all a bruise.

337
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,847
I said it. I fell
the river and hit me on the rocks.

338
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:19,346
Of the rocks that have reduced?

339
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,104
It is a rushing river.

340
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:31,268
(Elena) called Diane.
David did not come with you?

341
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:32,518
No..

342
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:37,098
He has gone on the first day
offensive. Wanted.

343
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,646
- Why has not returned?
- No.

344
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:44,679
It makes no sense.
If you have been here.

345
00:31:46,315 --> 00:31:48,436
We need to worry?

346
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,100
No ... No.

347
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:55,481
You have been blocked by Iraqi
counterattack.

348
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:59,642
- This seems worrying.
- David knows what to do.

349
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:02,980
It will give the stain for a while '
and find a solution.

350
00:32:03,232 --> 00:32:06,348
Diane will give birth within a week.
And if we go back in time?

351
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,016
Can return in safety.

352
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:10,809
No, if I lose.
We're not talking about there.

353
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,561
- Yes, but imagine, if not come back?
- What do I know?

354
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:21,890
You want to go there to find it?
You want this?

355
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,185
No..

356
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,687
No, honey, of course not.

357
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:30,474
(Elena) that ...

358
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:35,522
Sometimes I wonder if you feel a little
to us when you are here.

359
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:37,396
That's it.

360
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:41,345
During the journey
and the return I think of you.

361
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:44,972
I do not try to do while they are there.
Make it more difficult.

362
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:52,262
Plan.

363
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:56,137
Drown with hugs.

364
00:32:56,898 --> 00:32:59,849

365
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:02,263

(Sound of the street)

368
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:02,012

Good.

371
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,558
I was worried about feeling
those fights.

372
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:10,810
Oh yeah?

373
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:13,103
- What happened?
- Nothing ...

374
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:15,146
Everything was dark and I fell into a river.

375
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:18,844
You were in Kurdistan
to fall into a river?

376
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:22,603
Well, I know I'm not a fox ...
You can fly I know about them?

377
00:34:22,857 --> 00:34:25,310
Let me take now
talks to the media about it.

378
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,844
As for the flight?

379
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,683

380
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,935
(Sighs)

381
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,935
Very good. I made some copies
and put on bulletin board, right?

382
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,387
Bravissimo.

383
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:42,012
Do you know?

384
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:43,896
Yes Great shot.

385
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,687
How long you play,
this material of war?

386
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,429
- Eight, nine years?
- Twelve.

387
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,728
You should stop smoking.

388
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:57,229
(Ivan) Look to see

389
00:34:57,482 --> 00:35:01,392
- Just look at me me?
- I've been there.

390
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:05,310
For all it's time
to let go, do not you think?

391
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:07,603
Yes, when I'm there, I think.

392
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:13,770
I'm going when I'm there.
Then come back here ... separate worlds.

393
00:35:14,023 --> 00:35:15,895
Do you understand me? Separated.

394
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:19,846

You can not say the saddest thing.

398
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:33,479
I came to develop the film.
I do not need the lecture.

399
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,185

I missed you.

You, too.

415
00:38:27,148 --> 00:38:28,558
Hello.

416

(MUSIC)

417
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:16,144
David!

418
00:39:16,357 --> 00:39:17,305
(Part)

419
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,934
Elena.

420
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:34,351
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hello.

421
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,605
I took a starter.
I had to feed the beast.

422
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:40,641
- What stomach!
- If you do not eat angry!

423
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:43,387
- It moved!
- Have you heard?

424
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,473
Of course he had heard!

425
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,762
- How are you?
- Okay.

426
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:52,476
I have to pee
every five minutes.

427
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:54,106
Whenever David?

428
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:58,855
I understand that is their job
and that there is a war

429
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,638
But there must be a way
to send a message.

430
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:05,896
Or maybe not. If they cut
phone lines?

431
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:08,850
No matter the message.
I want David.

432
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,307
I therefore reduces and then goes
to Hell in Kurdistan.

433
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:13,560
Yes.

434
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:19,391
And if you send a cable
Kurdish refugee camp?

435
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:23,393
(Elena) I know many people there.
Could you at least ask around.

436
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:25,387
(Diana) I do not know.

437
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,558
Only one of the Red Cross's idea
led him

438
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:31,938
Tell your wife call
I can send the asylum.

439
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,185
So what?

440
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:36,805
You know what, you're right.

441
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:40,598
Very good. Let's do it.

442
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:49,181
(Sound of the street)

443
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:56,387
(Buza)

444
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:58,595
Mark!

445
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,682

446
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:06,262

448
00:41:10,273 --> 00:41:11,647
Journey so kind?

449
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:14,019
I think so. You tell me.

450
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:15,268
Dame.

451
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,637
So ...

452
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:20,229
A Peshmerga ambush '
a convoy in Iraq.

453
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:22,519
They killed dozens of soldiers

454
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,894
And cast out
a truck for transport.

455
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:25,764
Yes.

456
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:29,969
It's a pity Life
trinkets run only today.

457
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:32,057
However, I suggest to himself.

458
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:35,064
Find someone on the continent.

459
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:38,230
I heard there are many Kurds
in Germany, no?

460
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:41,433
- Or rather Turks?
- Both Turks and Kurds.

461
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,685
Yes.

462
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,895
Very good. Try to Stern.

463
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:46,262
In this case, what is it?

464
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,183
Triage.

465
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,763
- (Mark) provisionally.
- (Amy) Why?

466
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:55,471
It has been established
an emergency hospital.

467
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:59,939
Soldiers with severe injuries
dead.

468
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,264
"Killed? By whom?

469
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:05,806

This service is really a bomb.

474
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:22,895
You could put in an auction.

475
00:42:23,148 --> 00:42:26,763
Once sent to all weekly

But it is curious.

524
00:46:54,648 --> 00:47:00,099
Mark makes no mention of David.
It does not seem strange?

525
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:06,897
I do not know. Even to me it seems different.
Concerned.

526

And then more and more lame.

527

He says no, but ... (Sigh).

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,851
And tonight you know that I said?
He wants a son to me.

00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,357
(Elena) are
in many places together.

537
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:55,351
They are very good friends
but totally different.

538
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,814
David always concentrated
of beauty, hope.

539
00:48:00,982 --> 00:48:02,605
While Mark ...

540
00:48:02,898 --> 00:48:06,974
Well, several of his photos
No wall hanging.

541
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:20,804
(SOUND OF projector)

542
00:48:53,148 --> 00:48:56,230
(Sound of water flowing)

543
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:28,762
(Elena), Mark?

544
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:38,393
Mark?

545
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,101
Mark!

546
00:49:53,148 --> 00:50:08,271
(MUSIC)

547
00:50:11,148 --> 00:50:15,272
(Nurse), Ms. Walsh?
He has performed in neurology.

548
00:50:15,523 --> 00:50:19,469
He wiped his head wound
and removed a foreign body.

549
00:50:19,732 --> 00:50:22,599
Do not go. Can you explain?

550
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:24,931
I can not tell. Ask the disease.

551
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,731
Sorry.

552
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,064
- Can you tell me what your legs?
- I suspect a neurological problem.

553
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:36,439
You see the neurologist
answer all your questions.

554
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,515
Wait a few minutes.

555
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:47,762
(Crying)

556
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:53,019
The good news is that
no permanent damage.

557
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:57,184
Physically
Compromise Nothing, fortunately.

558
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,308
No neurological disorder
no broken bones.

559
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:03,931
C 'is still swollen and
hypersensitive along the spine,

560
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,480
Classic symptoms of trauma
impact, but is dissipating.

561
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,978
So, worst?

562
00:51:12,232 --> 00:51:15,728
He said he fell into a river
and hit the rocks.

563
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:17,474
- He said, too?
- Yes

564
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:19,639
But I have some doubts.

565
00:51:19,898 --> 00:51:23,595
We have drawn this page
on the back of the skull.

566
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:27,981
Composition: alloy steel
and cadmium, with traces of TNT,

567
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:31,811
Features: 3 mm,
serrate, curved on both sides,

568
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:36,557
And it gives a load of metal
very severe and sudden.

569
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:40,892
A splinter.

570
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:44,929
I think that Mark has been
near death, no.

571
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:49,100
A grenade exploded insurance
a few feet away.

572
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,769
E 'so that is injured.
But this is not the problem.

573
00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:57,147
Is there any medical condition
and physical properties of a net improvement.

574
00:51:57,398 --> 00:51:59,685
On the contrary, is getting worse.

575
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,137
Mean?

576
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:03,851
A psychosomatic complications.

577
00:52:04,107 --> 00:52:07,021
Perhaps a complaint
posttraumatic stress disorder.

578
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:10,970
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I think you need.

579
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:16,523
Why do not you tell me
explosion?

580
00:52:20,815 --> 00:52:23,683
It was easier to talk.

581
00:52:26,357 --> 00:52:28,182
Easier?

582
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,435
Yes.

583
00:52:30,107 --> 00:52:34,349
You worry so much,
each time giving birth.

584
00:52:46,065 --> 00:52:48,103
E 'is over.

585
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:49,933
You are at home.

586
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:52,720
I love you.

587
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,393
Do not be angry with me.

588
00:53:00,398 --> 00:53:02,389
I will.

589
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:08,688
- You'll see, everything will be fine.
- Yes

590
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,267
Sure.

591
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:37,266
(Sound of water flowing)

592
00:54:02,732 --> 00:54:07,934
(Free Phone SIGNAL)

593
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:10,896
Joaquνn Morales.

594
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:14,596
(In Spanish) Leave a message
after the beep.

595
00:54:15,732 --> 00:54:17,769
(In Spanish) Grandpa, are you there?

596
00:54:20,315 --> 00:54:22,353
(In Spanish) It's me, Elena.

597
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,974
(Mark) Body of children mutilated.

598
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:30,019
Law and '?

599
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:33,605
This test does not exist
right or wrong.

600
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:36,141
The following.

601
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,939
Ah, again.

602
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,847
Maimed woman's body.

603
00:54:48,607 --> 00:54:51,474
(Mark) body of a man maimed.
This was the father.

604
00:54:51,732 --> 00:54:55,014
They captured the whole family.
What bad luck!

605
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:57,394
For her it is all a game?

606
00:54:57,648 --> 00:55:03,099
I do not know. And it seems all so ...
Stupid, you know?

607
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:07,220
Maybe I was.
But I'm trying to help.

608
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:09,519
And soon I will go and I will be paid

609
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:12,641
What she responds
my questions or not.

610
00:55:12,898 --> 00:55:15,980
And she will stay here
unable to walk.

611
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:20,314
It is important to understand that stupidity
can take many forms.

612
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:23,644
It has never been in a war zone?

613
00:55:24,732 --> 00:55:25,929
No..

614
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,892
However, I have had patients
was.

615
00:55:29,148 --> 00:55:31,933
No offense, but I do not think
is the same thing.

616
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,105
No. Is not it the same.

617
00:55:36,357 --> 00:55:40,931
Then we can understand only
experience?

618
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:46,605
Only those who have been raped can give
advise the victim of a rape?

619
00:55:48,065 --> 00:55:49,226
Maybe.

620
00:55:51,273 --> 00:55:52,647
SOLO DA

621
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:06,348
I did not know Mark
had published a book.

622
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:17,639
I think I can help?

623
00:56:17,898 --> 00:56:21,098
Of course I can.
I can help anyone.

624
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:25,481
As I said last night
between us, nothing will change.

625
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:28,813
I wanted to come
only to help.

626
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:37,435
Why has it become so difficult,
so critical?

627
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:39,560
Oh ..

628
00:56:39,815 --> 00:56:43,394
Is always wrong
have some opinions?

629
00:56:43,648 --> 00:56:48,436
As for the Nazis,
or the actions of Stalin?

630
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:55,302
- What have you done?
- And what do you think?

631
00:56:56,357 --> 00:56:58,182
Sorry, I ...

632
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,726
No, this time I want to talk about it.

633
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:04,810
I've always refused
the possibility of confrontation.

634
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,477
You've come to know what I did

635
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:11,642
You got your idea
, and have closed the case.

636
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,147
What will it cost
again, you ask?

637
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:22,262
You are the only person
I have in the world.

638
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:26,564
Come on, tell me
What I can do that was so horrible?

639
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,727
I was his patient
war criminals. Monsters.

640
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:37,726
They have razed villages
and people tortured to death

641
00:57:37,982 --> 00:57:40,470
All in the name of Spain
Franco.

642
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:42,557
And when I left you

643
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:46,062
Configure acquitted
of all their sins.

644
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:48,804
Has purified.

645
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:52,898
You also
adjusted well, right?

646
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:55,186
Very effective.

647
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,933
Impact D '.

648
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:01,100
Morales Institute
Purification psychologically.

649
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:04,604
Thousands of innocent
massacred, exterminated.

650
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:08,352
And when his murderers
was to blame

651
00:58:08,607 --> 00:58:12,221
You and you said:
Do not worry, I had no choice.

652
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:14,307
It is with his life.

653
00:58:14,565 --> 00:58:18,689
The men were taken by me
the "monsters" as they are called,

654
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,349
Because they lost.

655
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:23,807
They carried me
as a last hope

656
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:27,347
And yes, I have purified
I have no regrets. To you is simple.

657
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:32,477
They were bad men, and from
I took care of me too badly.

658
00:58:35,523 --> 00:58:37,561
But you forget one thing.

659
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:41,145
They were men who had won,

660
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:49,177
Luckily, both
of Spain in your hands

661
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,477
And he had tasted power.

662
00:58:53,523 --> 00:58:57,647
And what is the highest power
a man can have?

663
00:58:58,523 --> 00:59:00,561
That will kill them.

664
00:59:01,357 --> 00:59:05,481
And if you have thousands of dead,
What changes would kill others?

665
00:59:05,732 --> 00:59:10,306
If a person has tortured
difficult torturing another?

666
00:59:10,565 --> 00:59:14,061
No. It's easy.
It's the easiest thing in the world.

667
00:59:15,273 --> 00:59:18,355
That was to keep people
punch in our country.

668
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:20,432
What would I do?

669
00:59:21,398 --> 00:59:25,890
Turn left at the loss,
to make them continue to kill?

670
00:59:26,148 --> 00:59:28,897
No. It would never have allowed.

671
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,763
And then I have been purified. Many.

672
00:59:33,565 --> 00:59:37,938
Tome and brought back to life

673
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:41,472
Then mankind.

674
00:59:42,773 --> 00:59:46,897
(Joaquin) Want to know
how I saved?

675
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:49,767
I saved several.

676
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:54,266
Now you know how things are.
Also what you want.

677
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:58,265
However, r is no longer a teenager.

678
00:59:59,565 --> 01:00:02,018
The world is very complex.

679
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,564
There are few things
that are either black or white.

680
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:45,226
Oh, then we are not sleeping.
How do you feel?

681
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:47,934
Good.

682
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,813
(Joaquin) Magnificent.

683
01:00:50,065 --> 01:00:51,344
What time is it?

684
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:55,387
It is time to start.
Beyond that, who knows?

685
01:00:55,648 --> 01:00:59,429
Elena called Leri
He spoke of their difficulties

686
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,771
And I asked her out.
I answered: Well.

687
01:01:03,023 --> 01:01:06,851
I was hesitant because now
no more army for several years.

688
01:01:07,107 --> 01:01:08,932
Sorry, said Elena?

689
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,314
I am Joaquin Morales
Elena's grandfather.

690
01:01:13,565 --> 01:01:18,388
Carmen, his mother tells me
often of his adventures.

691
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:23,021
(Joaquin) Now, finally
We know

692
01:01:23,273 --> 01:01:27,682
It's a shame
that in these circumstances.

693
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,724
I guess you heard
much of me.

694
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:34,892
I knew it had closed relations
years, he was a fascist.

695
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:36,890
I am a fascist?

696
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:40,681
It has a fertile imagination.

697
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:44,355
Wow, this talk
being diverted

698
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:46,681
the real reason for my coming.

699
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:50,850
First, I want to do
quick medical history,

700
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,809
Obviously, if you
has nothing against that.

701
01:01:54,732 --> 01:01:57,055
I have no choice.

702
01:01:57,315 --> 01:01:59,519
- Age?
- 34.

703
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:02,344
The parents are alive?

704
01:02:03,065 --> 01:02:06,975
(Yawns Mark) My father
is dead and my mother lives in London.

705
01:02:07,232 --> 01:02:09,685
- Brothers or sisters?
- No.

706
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:13,565
Well, then get started.

707
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:15,143
Is that it?

708
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,677
What?

709
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:20,850
I thought that psychiatrists
a lot of questions on children,

710
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:23,062
In those experiences, those relationships.

711
01:02:23,315 --> 01:02:25,436
It is not necessary. Exotic.

712
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,729
You're not a psychiatrist, right?

713
01:02:29,648 --> 01:02:35,099
In truth, I prefer to define
a student of the human soul.

714
01:02:35,857 --> 01:02:37,682
Suggestive.

715
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:40,850
- Tells the story of the war.
- What?

716
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:42,516
A history of the war.

717
01:02:42,773 --> 01:02:45,973
Will undoubtedly have many
but the first thing that comes to mind.

718
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:49,313
There is a bit too early
for one of those?

719
01:02:53,898 --> 01:02:55,723
Really?

720
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:12,514
(Voices in Arabic)

721
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:39,349
(Voices in Arabic)

722
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:40,601
(Rumors)

723
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,605
I do not know if the family
recovered his body.

724
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:53,688
Why this event
problems, in your opinion?

725
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,219
I do not know.

726
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:58,472
I felt responsible.

727
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:03,638
Then, if she had not been there,
not escape.

728
01:04:04,565 --> 01:04:07,563
The soldiers did not shoot. MH?

729
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:11,598
I guess so.

730
01:04:11,857 --> 01:04:13,729
All of this makes sense.

731
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:18,189
Do you feel responsible for this death
partly because in reality.

732
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,936
Do you think it is too difficult?

733
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:27,427
For those who told this story?
Four? Three? Two? Twenty?

734
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:32,098
What do you say?
Oh, do not blame you.

735
01:04:32,357 --> 01:04:36,481
Oh, no, it was not your fault.
I could not do anything.

736
01:04:36,732 --> 01:04:37,810
Do I have reason?

737
01:04:38,773 --> 01:04:41,392
You tried
forgiveness, in others

738
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:45,180
But then he realized that this is something
anyone can give.

739
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,564
We can not get rid of pain,
We took with us forever.

740
01:04:49,815 --> 01:04:51,852
That means live.

741
01:04:52,565 --> 01:04:58,064
Now I live alone with the pain.
Look at me.

742
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:02,887
I have 86 years.

743
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:06,312
I lost my whole family.

744
01:05:06,565 --> 01:05:08,686
I lost my parents.

745
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:14,019
I lost my brothers and sisters
and I've lost my wife.

746
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:17,722
However, I'm still here.

747
01:05:17,982 --> 01:05:23,812
I can still smile, and the world
remains a wonderful place.

748
01:05:27,273 --> 01:05:28,517
Ah.

749
01:05:29,773 --> 01:05:32,937
Elena will be here soon.

750
01:05:33,898 --> 01:05:36,517
Tell him I'll be at the hotel.

751
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:45,435
Oh, by the. She knows that her
is the so-called sleep of children?

752
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:49,897
No movement, no wrinkle
face as a child.

753
01:05:50,148 --> 01:05:51,689
A good sign, right?

754
01:05:52,565 --> 01:05:53,595
No..

755
01:05:53,857 --> 01:05:56,938
When stirred
and talk in your sleep

756
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:00,390
It means that the problem
is no longer latent.

757
01:06:00,648 --> 01:06:04,772
But the serenity of an adult male
not a good sign.

758
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:14,055
(Chorus)

759
01:06:15,398 --> 01:06:16,772
Thank you.

760
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:25,221
- (Doctor) Bye.
- Thanks.

761
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,554
Thank you.

762
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:34,014
- See you at home.
- Claro.

763
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,607
(Mark) Twelve, thirteen,
fourteen ...

764
01:06:52,857 --> 01:06:54,314
(Phone rings)

765
01:06:54,565 --> 01:06:57,563
(Mark) Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

766
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,689
Excellent.
It's almost back to normal.

767
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:04,021
Liar. I move
with less grace than her.

768
01:07:04,273 --> 01:07:05,470
Wonderful!

769
01:07:05,732 --> 01:07:10,105
A sense of humor is always
The last ability to recover.

770
01:07:10,357 --> 01:07:11,766
Was the trade.

771
01:07:12,023 --> 01:07:13,848
The Red Cross in Kurdistan

772
01:07:14,107 --> 01:07:18,017
They are found in a search for a hotel
David Staff. A Rawa ...

773
01:07:18,273 --> 01:07:19,932
Rawanduz.

774
01:07:20,773 --> 01:07:21,768
Yes.

775
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:26,019
It is a small town in the north.
It was our base.

776
01:07:26,273 --> 01:07:29,224
(Elena) Did not you
who had gone south?

777
01:07:29,482 --> 01:07:34,435
I do not know. He was heading south
and had to return to Rawanduz.

778
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:38,684
But then came the opportunity
and went to Turkey.

779
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:42,850
Still there (Elena) their stuff.
His clothes, everything.

780
01:07:43,857 --> 01:07:47,767
Very good. Know someone
we call?

781
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:49,101
I do not know.

782
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,472
- Think! Will anyone.
- Do not know.

783
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:54,599
Without Seve at this time.
It is not helpful.

784
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:58,562
What am I to Diane?

785
01:07:58,815 --> 01:08:00,640
My God, what?

786
01:08:03,357 --> 01:08:06,438
I go to it. Call
If you can think of something.

787
01:08:13,273 --> 01:08:16,437
I'm afraid I do not understand.

788
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:21,221
My best friend, David ...

789
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:25,392
We went together in Kurdistan
and then we parted.

790
01:08:28,065 --> 01:08:32,059
- Had arrived a week ago.
- What do you care?

791
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:35,765
Fairly, yes.

792
01:08:36,023 --> 01:08:38,938
His wife will give birth
a few days.

793
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:42,387
But he is a conservative.

794
01:08:43,898 --> 01:08:46,731
It is not the first time
that one of us a lot in return.

795
01:08:47,898 --> 01:08:50,517
Hmm. And it's a war zone

796
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:55,680
Obviously easy
there are delays.

797
01:08:57,190 --> 01:09:01,184
I do not think that should
worry, let it go.

798
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,936
The most important thing
is to focus on his therapy.

799
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,097
Here, in this sense,

800
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:14,811
I know little or nothing
in terms of geography of Kurdistan.

801
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:18,680
Area L 'is divided
by the British, right?

802
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,802
Yes.

803
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:24,636
Whenever there
a casino in the world

804
01:09:24,898 --> 01:09:26,723
It is always thanks to them or French.

805
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:30,975
Look, why not draw
a map of the place?

806
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:33,427
(Mark spits smoke)

807
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:38,222
- Where in the wall?
- Why not?

808
01:09:38,482 --> 01:09:41,930
Do you think contrast
with the lease?

809
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,227
Why, only a sketch.

810
01:09:59,857 --> 01:10:01,894
(Joaquin) And while drawing,

811
01:10:02,148 --> 01:10:06,059
Because I do not tell
another of his stories about the war?

812
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:05,307
(Speaking in foreign dialect)

813
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:07,390
Sorry, could not understand.

814
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:09,888
(Speaking in foreign dialect)

815
01:11:10,148 --> 01:11:14,852
(Speaking in foreign dialect)

816
01:12:49,607 --> 01:12:52,142
According to the probability

817
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:56,522
None of the skulls belonged
one of their relatives.

818
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:58,432
Therefore, in reality,

819
01:12:58,732 --> 01:13:01,978
I was very
alien to take home.

820
01:13:02,232 --> 01:13:05,597
If considering a thing.

821
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,849
That woman knew
I was pretending.

822
01:13:10,107 --> 01:13:15,060
That was the thanks.
He thanked the farce.

823
01:13:15,315 --> 01:13:19,178
To show that I put
stand on their own good.

824
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,564
It is very difficult to be
a survivor, I know?

825
01:13:23,815 --> 01:13:29,314
Sometimes it is necessary to
their faith in magic.

826
01:13:29,565 --> 01:13:35,265
Knowing or believing in things
are not true, if you want to move forward.

827
01:13:35,523 --> 01:13:37,561
It is a kind of instinct.

828
01:13:37,815 --> 01:13:41,476
To continue,
if you want to survive,

829
01:13:41,732 --> 01:13:45,772
You must ... burial of the dead.

830
01:13:49,357 --> 01:13:53,185
(Joaquin) For her
camera

831
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,386
It acts as a filter for the distance
of what is around?

832
01:13:57,648 --> 01:14:01,938
Sure. I think that for this
Many photographers have been killed.

833
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:04,602
When looking at the target,

834
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,436
Forget that the things they see
are happening.

835
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:11,558
But sometimes the opposite occurs.

836
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:14,813
Sometimes the real world
takes over

837
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:18,395
And there
to help you, you feel alone.

838
01:14:18,648 --> 01:14:22,772
Why did you Photographers
always travel together, right?

839
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:24,267
I think so.

840
01:14:24,523 --> 01:14:29,015
- E 'to protect one another.
- Yes, that too.

841
01:14:29,273 --> 01:14:31,762
However, one observation.

842
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:39,309
I do not call it an obsession,

843
01:14:39,565 --> 01:14:43,511
But because he cares so much
What happens to the bodies? Me

844
01:14:43,773 --> 01:14:48,347
I realized
child when he spoke of Beirut.

845
01:14:48,607 --> 01:14:50,313
In the end, he said:

846
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:55,306
I do not know if that family
recovered his body.

847
01:14:56,565 --> 01:15:00,973
Why is it so important
for her the fate of the dead?

848
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:06,019
Maybe ... superstition.

849
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:08,228
(Joaquin) superstition?

850
01:15:08,482 --> 01:15:12,392
Yes That the dead should be
returned to their families.

851
01:15:12,732 --> 01:15:14,557
They should not be left alone.

852
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,386
For you are more important
survivors?

853
01:15:17,648 --> 01:15:18,643
No..

854
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:22,098
I do not know.

855
01:15:22,357 --> 01:15:27,014
I do not understand what is
trying to imply.

856
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:30,022
- I think so.
- I said no.

857
01:15:30,273 --> 01:15:33,970
How does it feel to see all those bodies
unarmed scattered everywhere?

858
01:15:34,232 --> 01:15:36,057
"Sadness? Scared?

859
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:39,846
Relief? It is not necessary
which one?

860
01:15:40,107 --> 01:15:43,188
- To be survived?
- Fuck you.

861
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,142
- What?
- I said fuck off.

862
01:15:46,398 --> 01:15:49,846
I'm not one of their criminal
war. I do not care.

863
01:15:50,107 --> 01:15:51,932
You said you want to talk ...

864
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:54,311
Never asked
vine come here!

865
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:56,769
I slept in the hospital room

866
01:15:57,023 --> 01:15:59,310
You came to break
and woke me up!

867
01:15:59,565 --> 01:16:01,390
We interrupt if desired.

868
01:16:01,648 --> 01:16:04,765
- Yes, I have to sleep.
- Returned home.

869
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:07,097
No, she is old. Stay where you are.

870
01:16:07,357 --> 01:16:19,397
(MUSIC)

871
01:16:34,482 --> 01:16:36,970
(Sound of water flowing)

872
01:16:56,898 --> 01:16:58,272
(NOISE CURTAINS
Starting)

873
01:17:04,065 --> 01:17:06,600
Oh, so I was awake.

874
01:17:06,857 --> 01:17:07,887
What time is it?

875
01:17:08,148 --> 01:17:09,771
C'mon, get up. Permanent.

876
01:17:10,023 --> 01:17:11,220
I need a coffee first.

877
01:17:11,482 --> 01:17:15,013
I will prepare myself.
Starting with their exercises.

878
01:17:22,648 --> 01:17:24,686
(Try and puffs)

879
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,436
Perfect. I'm cured.

880
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,558
Call
the first page of the newspaper.

881
01:17:37,815 --> 01:17:39,852
I am interested.

882
01:17:42,148 --> 01:17:45,763
SADAM Kurds poisoned city.
FORECAST OF THE DEAD 5000.

883
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,763
Killer Bastard!

884
01:17:50,482 --> 01:17:53,682
You may find a bit strong
his taste for Celtic

885
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:57,981
But I am convinced
will do very well.

886
01:17:58,232 --> 01:18:03,185
The French have defined our
Cafι Les jus de chausettes.

887
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,137
- What do you think ...
- Juice of socks, I know.

888
01:18:07,523 --> 01:18:11,055
Something does not know?

889
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:12,689
Thank you.

890
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:17,763
Who took this picture
It was a fortune.

891
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:22,147
We could stay there for a month
Perhaps it arrived yesterday.

892
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:25,811
But it was when it happened.
We thought it would be wrong ...

893
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:27,060
Us?

894
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:30,727
Do you and your friend, David?

895
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:35,307
Yes.

896
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:42,851
I wondered if by chance
wants me to do another photo.

897
01:18:43,107 --> 01:18:47,563
A 'of the road other
the incident has occurred.

898
01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:51,728
It is not necessary in detail.

899
01:18:52,523 --> 01:18:56,220
The areas where they
the hill and river.

900
01:18:57,898 --> 01:18:59,936
Then, stand up! Up, up!

901
01:19:12,273 --> 01:19:13,268
Very good.

902
01:19:16,565 --> 01:19:18,602
Let's see ...

903
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:27,138
(Mark) This is the hill, river.

904
01:19:28,982 --> 01:19:32,477
And here is where the explosion occurred.

905
01:19:35,773 --> 01:19:40,928
And here, more or less
is where I fell into the water.

906
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:44,851
And this is where
found.

907
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:49,231
- The Cave of Harir is there somewhere.
- Tell me David.

908
01:19:49,482 --> 01:19:53,427
Where was
When there was an explosion?

909
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:03,553
I've known all along, Mark.

910
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:09,231
From the first time I heard
the name and saw his face.

911
01:20:09,482 --> 01:20:13,606
And now you must
tell your story.

912
01:20:14,732 --> 01:20:16,936
Not easy, I know.

913
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:22,345
I felt accepted
it is not as strong as believed,

914
01:20:22,607 --> 01:20:26,980
And you can not
continue like this forever.

915
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:34,011
We have to stop running
by people who are.

916
01:20:38,065 --> 01:20:39,143
David!

917
01:20:39,398 --> 01:20:41,472
(Male) Mr. Walsh! Come!

918
01:20:52,273 --> 01:20:55,390
(Mark) do not come.
We stopped here.

919
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:58,730
(Mark) Very well, then good luck.
Good luck.

920
01:21:08,857 --> 01:21:12,981
(David) To what extent is lacking
your opinion?

921
01:21:13,232 --> 01:21:16,763
I do not know. It was your bright idea.

922
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:18,848
Are you still mad at me?

923
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:22,021
No, you're right.
It's time to go home.

924
01:21:22,273 --> 01:21:24,596
I think not. It seems impossible.

925
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:49,012
You know what?

926
01:21:49,273 --> 01:21:51,063
(Explosion)

927
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:13,561
(David cries)

928
01:22:15,607 --> 01:22:16,685
David!

929
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,184
(David cries)

930
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,435
David!

931
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:20,685
David!

932
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,935
David!

933
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:24,264
Do not shoot!

934
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,730
Hey! Eh! Hey!

935
01:22:27,982 --> 01:22:30,648
Hey! Eh! Hey!

936
01:22:30,898 --> 01:22:32,806
Hey! Hey!

937
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:34,476
Ah!

938
01:22:36,982 --> 01:22:37,976
Ah!

939
01:22:38,232 --> 01:22:41,099
No! Do not want to die!

940
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,435
Ah!

941
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,849
No! No!

942
01:22:47,107 --> 01:22:48,765
Mark, I'm dying!

943
01:22:53,898 --> 01:22:54,893
Ah!

944
01:22:56,982 --> 01:22:58,439
Ah!

945
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:02,970
What have I done!

946
01:23:10,773 --> 01:23:15,395
Ah! Mark! I'm going to die!

947
01:23:15,648 --> 01:23:19,227
Ah! Mark! I'm going to die! No!

948
01:23:19,482 --> 01:23:23,013
Mark! I'm going to die! I'm going to die!

949
01:23:23,857 --> 01:23:27,802
Mark take me home!
Take me home, please!

950
01:23:28,065 --> 01:23:33,683
(David crying)

951
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,513
- Oh
- Diane, please ...

952
01:24:07,023 --> 01:24:09,346
Mark. The chair. Take the chair.

953
01:24:09,607 --> 01:24:12,889
- You have to take her to hospital!
- Breathe. Do not worry.

954
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:16,564
Take it. Quickly.

955
01:24:16,815 --> 01:24:20,062
Calm down. Calm down .. Breaths.

956
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,683
Come on.

957
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,563
(Diana)) Oh!

958
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,727
- Come on.
- (Helena) Let's go.

959
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:03,809
Here.

960
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:14,103
Want to pick?

961
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:29,476
(Crying)

962
01:25:32,148 --> 01:25:34,518
Sorry.

963
01:25:34,773 --> 01:25:37,606
Diane, I loved him.

964
01:25:41,815 --> 01:25:43,852
He loved you.

965
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:49,346
I wanted to say ...

966
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,227
But I do not know how.

967
01:25:56,148 --> 01:25:58,139
Where did you bury?

968
01:25:59,607 --> 01:26:02,474
(Sighs)

969
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:13,063
(Verses of hesitation)

970
01:26:42,148 --> 01:26:43,143
Hello.

971
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,517
Where is Mark?

972
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,726
I do not know. He left a moment ago.

973
01:26:56,315 --> 01:26:57,310
Elena.

974
01:26:59,482 --> 01:27:01,223
It was nice to him.

975
01:27:01,773 --> 01:27:04,724
We do not know what it feels

976
01:27:04,982 --> 01:27:07,980
Go to places like this and come back.

977
01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:15,686
Anyway, be nice to him,
has returned.

978
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:07,227
I wanted to bring him home.

979
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,563
Really.

980
01:28:12,023 --> 01:28:14,642
I repeat:

981
01:28:15,357 --> 01:28:23,558
Courage, not fear.
I'll take with me. I'll take you home.

982
01:28:31,273 --> 01:28:33,430
I'll take you home.

983
01:28:34,357 --> 01:28:36,680
I'm going to take home.

984
01:28:44,315 --> 01:28:48,937
(Mark) After hours of walking,
I came to a river

985
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:52,022
And there was no cross it.

986
01:28:52,273 --> 01:28:57,014
I could not do anything except
jump and hope.

987
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:08,930
(Sound of water flowing)

988
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:34,972
(Mark) was too heavy,
I was drowning.

989
01:29:36,898 --> 01:29:41,472
I could not breathe.
I could not breathe.

990
01:29:41,732 --> 01:29:47,266
So is ... let him go.

991
01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:22,644
Sorry.

992
01:30:28,107 --> 01:30:30,014
I love you.

993
01:30:30,273 --> 01:30:32,228
I love you so much.

994
01:31:21,188 --> 01:31:30,563
"Only the dead have seen
the end of the war."
