1
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,950
Our brothers of the Nationalists'
168th Division

2
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,517
This is Captain Gu Zidi of the 139th Regiment
3rd Battalion, 9th Company

3
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,070
the Special 2nd Division of the Liberation Army

4
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,669
On behalf of my company, I'd like to greet you

5
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,238
You are completely surrounded

6
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,158
If you keep fighting

7
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
You won't like how things end up

8
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,874
We offer you two choices

9
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,473
You can get bullets

10
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,637
Or maybe you'd prefer dumplings

11
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,556
We can keep the bullets coming

12
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,199
If you have had enough

13
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,079
Trade in your weapons for chopsticks

14
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,675
Sit down with your brothers here in the 9th company

15
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,069
We can all eat dumplings

16
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,995
Gu

17
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,673
Quit the bullshit

18
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,519
Let's move in

19
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,755
Wait

20
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,149
They're already cooking in a pot

21
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,309
What's the hurry?

22
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,718
Captain

23
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,956
Something doesn't look right

24
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,559
Have they already retreated?

25
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,199
The battalion ordered a hasty attack

26
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,230
What are we waiting for?

27
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,439
Jiao

28
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,871
Coming

29
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,557
Take six men and get a closer look

30
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,313
Find them six helmets

31
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,515
Smoke grenade

32
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,750
Jiang

33
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,315
Go

34
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,353
Take cover

35
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,590
Take cover

36
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,795
Up there.

37
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,432
Give me your hand

38
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,436
Pull me up

39
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,516
Help me!

40
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,839
Jiang

41
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,077
Jiang

42
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,119
Take out those two up there

43
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,716
How many are there?

44
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,710
I don't know

45
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,800
Cease fire!

46
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,950
Cease fire!

47
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,754
Help the wounded

48
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,750
Hurry!

49
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,672
Covering fire

50
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,232
Medic

51
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,117
Hurry

52
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,436
I'm going to die, save me

53
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,908
Hurry up

54
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,954
Slowly. Slowly

55
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,155
Hurry up

56
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,279
Get the bandages, hurry

57
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,958
Hang in there man

58
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,511
OK

59
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,756
Hurry up

60
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,720
Move him

61
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,357
First platoon

62
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,390
Follow me

63
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,630
Second Platoon

64
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,676
Protect the flanks

65
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,470
Don't bunch up

66
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,277
Spread out

67
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,156
Keep spreading out

68
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,516
Keep up

69
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,949
There's lightning

70
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,312
Get down, take cover

71
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,232
Fall back

72
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,956
Captain Gu

73
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,397
Get down, get down

74
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,995
Everyone get down, don't run around

75
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,639
Get down,

76
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,669
Get up

77
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,914
We've been ambushed

78
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,750
Take cover

79
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,597
Get down

80
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,551
Second platoon, attack

81
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,755
Reinforce first platoon

82
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,313
Third platoon, save the wounded

83
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,356
Leave the dead

84
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,634
Tend the wounded first

85
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,518
Luo, get on the roof

86
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,758
Lu and Jiang

87
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,156
Stop cowering

88
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,871
Let's go

89
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,394
Bring up the heavy weapons

90
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,077
Yes sir

91
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,309
Follow me

92
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,755
Get down

93
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,516
On the ground

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,237
Get down

95
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,510
Move in, now!

96
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,115
Get the machine gun

97
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,548
No one move

98
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,757
Gu

99
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,519
Set up a base of fire

100
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,438
Send in the assault forces

101
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,590
We're pinned down

102
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,592
The enemy has artillery

103
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,597
Let the troops regroup

104
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
How can we stop now?

105
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,313
I disagree

106
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,196
I am the captain

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,270
I'm in charge

108
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,118
That is cowardly behavior

109
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,718
I won't let that happen

110
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,995
Are you moving in or not?

111
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,753
I'm going in anyway

112
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,354
What for?

113
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,958
If you want to get yourself killed

114
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,155
No one can stop you

115
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,509
Political Officer!

116
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,189
Hurry

117
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,349
Brothers

118
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,558
Attack!

119
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,196
Political Officer!

120
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,399
Don't shoot

121
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,039
We surrender

122
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,470
We surrender, don't shoot

123
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,629
Don't shoot

124
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,548
The enemy has surrendered

125
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,433
Let them pick up their weapons

126
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,671
No surrender accepted

127
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,439
Pick up your weapons

128
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,193
Pick up your weapons

129
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,236
No one move

130
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,117
No one move!

131
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,796
Luo

132
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,632
What are you waiting for?

133
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,429
Fire!

134
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,033
They have already surrendered

135
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,990
Jiang

136
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,915
Jiang

137
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,519
Fire

138
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,477
Jiang

139
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,669
You cannot kill POWs

140
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,991
Stop pretending to be a saint

141
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,519
The Political Officer was blown apart

142
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,670
Harder

143
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,595
Harder

144
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,909
Those in the back, keep up

145
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,070
Harder

146
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,118
Including the wounded

147
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,749
Anyone who were not carried away by stretcher

148
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,553
We still have forty six men left

149
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,349
A hundred seventeen minus forty six

150
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,195
Our company lost seventy one men

151
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,718
Get me a casualty list

152
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,670
Report the final count

153
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,756
On the double

154
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,229
Fight a battle, report a funeral

155
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,117
Don't keep making me do this

156
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,639
You are the only one who can read

157
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,913
The Political Officer is gone

158
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,998
Who else is there?

159
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,072
The Nationalists have good uniforms

160
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,552
But their fighting is not up to snuff

161
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,310
We found a wheel

162
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,879
See if it fits

163
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,516
The 7th Company found three howitzers

164
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,273
Two ten wheelers

165
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,109
All we find is a small, crippled mountain gun

166
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,958
Bite your tongues

167
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,189
Feel the pain?

168
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,959
That means you are still alive

169
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,470
What is the use of all these metal scraps?

170
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,269
In our last battle

171
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,515
The 3rd battalion's 9th company

172
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,239
Fought bravely without giving up

173
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,311
They suffered heavy casualties

174
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,591
We were going to commend them

175
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,112
But Captain Gu Zidi

176
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,789
Ordered the POWs shot

177
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,714
And stole their uniforms

178
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,069
He disobeyed army discipline

179
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,073
And disgraced our entire regiment

180
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,473
The Division Commander has ordered us

181
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,910
To punish him

182
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,633
for his misconduct

183
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,955
Therefore

184
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,598
The regiment's Party leadership has decided

185
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,031
To punish all those involved accordingly

186
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,196
Firstly

187
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,192
The 9th Company's troops are to be transferred

188
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,198
Captain Gu Zidi's forty six men

189
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,799
Will all move to the regiment's Advanced Guard

190
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,950
Until further instruction

191
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,749
Secondly

192
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,400
Captain Gu Zidi, of the 9th Company

193
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,515
Is to be punished for his mistake accordingly

194
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,790
He's to be locked up for three days.

195
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,716
Captain Gu

196
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,434
Have something to eat

197
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,148
The food is getting cold

198
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,238
You know when I last had a bed under me?

199
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,114
I am having the ball of my life

200
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,952
Food can wait

201
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,679
I guess I caught up on my rest

202
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,159
This is the best I've felt since
joining the battalion

203
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,989
This barn is huge

204
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,356
How much grain can it hold?

205
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,949
What a waste locking us up in here

206
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,392
What's your name?

207
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,352
Wang Jincun

208
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,869
What's your job?

209
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,510
I was a teacher

210
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,318
You were busy writing when I first got here

211
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,238
You were still writing when I woke up

212
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,909
What are you writing?

213
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,596
A letter home

214
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,273
To your wife?

215
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,116
And this?

216
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,878
Did your wife knit it?

217
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,116
Huh?

218
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,829
Yes

219
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,749
I heard them say

220
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,951
A teacher in the 1st Battalion

221
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,673
Pissed in his pants in battle

222
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,439
And he was disciplined

223
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,755
Are you the one?

224
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,036
No? Not you?

225
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,950
Who cares if it is?

226
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,150
All you did was pee

227
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,430
That's better than getting killed

228
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,555
Bullets flying everywhere

229
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,319
Grenades exploding down your pants

230
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,155
Even a god would pee

231
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,513
Don't get the wrong idea

232
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,389
Moving you to the front

233
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,872
It's not part of the punishment

234
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,359
It shows our trust in you

235
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,830
I've seen the old mine battlefield

236
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,996
The location is good

237
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,590
It's much higher

238
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,199
than the north bank

239
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,711
They won't be able to see our movement

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,877
We'll get the upper hand by securing it

241
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,117
We planned to

242
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,273
transfer two companies from the 2nd Battalion

243
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,115
But now

244
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,958
The defensive area has expanded

245
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,070
I can't spare the troops

246
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,676
Are you following?

247
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,196
Say something

248
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,796
Damn delicious

249
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,910
Look

250
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,475
Only girls wear down their shoes here

251
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,957
When will you learn to walk like a man?

252
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,915
Stop messing around

253
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,551
Tell me what you need

254
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,398
I'll do whatever I can

255
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,476
What you want?

256
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,515
In that case

257
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,674
I don't have enough artillery

258
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,791
I need Maxim machineguns

259
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,314
I'll.

260
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,909
Give you two machine guns

261
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,713
And three thousand rounds

262
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,109
I want to keep that mountain gun

263
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,032
Shells are hard to find

264
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,799
The quartermaster will check

265
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,399
You can take whatever he finds

266
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,235
My troops are good in the trenches

267
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,158
Especially with explosives

268
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,271
You've got to let me take all I want

269
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,631
Go ahead

270
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,592
Take as much as you can carry

271
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,954
I don't have enough men

272
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,878
Give me thirty more

273
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,111
No way

274
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,838
After all, I'm the provisional
captain of the advanced guards

275
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,233
How about twenty more men?

276
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,076
No way

277
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,150
Five?

278
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,878
That's not a lot to ask

279
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,871
The regiment's troops are all deployed

280
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,275
I can't spare a single man

281
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,597
Gu

282
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,550
There really are no men left

283
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,878
The Colonel's bodyguard is dead

284
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,188
And there is no replacement

285
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,079
I now serve as the Bugler and his bodyguard

286
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,795
It's the truth

287
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,596
Fine

288
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,718
Then just give me one person

289
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,834
I need a Political Officer

290
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,555
You've only got half a company

291
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,478
What you need a Political Officer for?

292
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,793
In the last battle

293
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,598
If the Political Officer hadn't died

294
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,599
I wouldn't have made that mistake

295
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,315
Now you know

296
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,989
You can be your own Political Officer

297
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,874
Can we.

298
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,476
Keep the helmets and boots

299
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,716
we took from the POWs?

300
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,955
What?

301
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,315
Okay, keep them

302
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,029
Liangzi

303
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,114
Get the stuff for him

304
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,437
Liangzi

305
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,830
What are the goodies?

306
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,876
Yellow Dragon cigarettes.

307
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,433
The Colonel won't even smoke them himself

308
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,033
Why is there only half a carton left?

309
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,797
Give the rest to him

310
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,272
You're always so stingy

311
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,748
Giving half a pack at best

312
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,991
What's so special this time?

313
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,110
Gu

314
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,955
How many of us are left?

315
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,595
I mean from the old guerilla unit?

316
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,398
You. Me

317
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,190
Anyone else?

318
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,199
Okay

319
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,150
Have the troops get ready on the double

320
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,714
The defensive position

321
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,558
Has already been built by the 2nd Battalion

322
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,550
You.

323
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,114
Take good care of yourself

324
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,199
I have one last request

325
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,510
I'll find myself a Political Officer

326
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,034
You can't say no

327
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,117
I want my cellmate

328
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,913
He'd be shot anyway

329
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,559
He might as well die in battle

330
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,950
Liangzi

331
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,480
That bent up bugle dangling on your butt

332
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,469
Is it busted?

333
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,789
No

334
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,835
It is fine

335
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,680
You better blow as hard as you can

336
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,790
Don't worry

337
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,432
You've heard my bugle call before

338
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,751
My ears are already wide open

339
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,913
Repeat the orders

340
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,038
By tomorrow twelve noon

341
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,190
No matter what it takes

342
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,111
We must secure the old mine on the southern bank

343
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,390
What else?

344
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,315
Always listen.

345
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,395
For the assembly bugle call

346
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,270
Fall back whenever we hear it

347
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,798
If you don't hear the bugle call

348
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,476
Even if you're the last man standing

349
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,233
You will keep fighting

350
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,556
Yes, sir

351
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,548
In this open area

352
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,155
It's impossible to last even four hours

353
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,520
Move the small canon to the rear for now

354
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,236
Yes, sir

355
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,510
Push harder

356
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,830
Get two more people here

357
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,115
Put them inside

358
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,954
Put them all inside

359
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,792
If a shell lands on them

360
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,797
We'd all be gone

361
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,356
Put them inside

362
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,993
Bring more bags here

363
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,396
Pack it in real tight

364
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,795
It's for your own protection

365
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,511
Yes, sir

366
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,870
Pack it in real tight

367
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,676
Yes, sir

368
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,190
Hey, Lu

369
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,714
How many times have I told you?

370
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,109
Don't tie it straight

371
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,588
You have to tie it at an angle

372
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,789
Wrap it around twice

373
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,950
As tightly as you can

374
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,592
Got it?

375
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,556
Lieutenant

376
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,593
Last time we tied it at an angle

377
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,110
They ended up not flying straight

378
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,389
They landed on the 5th Company

379
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,956
No shit?

380
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,519
Why wasn't I told?

381
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,310
Jerk, I'll kill you

382
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,549
Look

383
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,119
These make obvious targets

384
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,997
Gather everyone together

385
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,110
Place them like you're supposed to

386
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,912
Make sure they're twenty paces apart

387
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,232
No, not this time

388
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,748
Put three in front and three in back

389
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,875
Captain

390
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,788
I found him for you

391
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,069
Good

392
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,950
Over here

393
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,150
Come over

394
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,510
Jiao

395
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,875
Your message bag

396
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,675
Here

397
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,870
Your rifle

398
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,551
Hey guys

399
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,870
I have someone to introduce

400
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,112
This is our company's new Political Officer

401
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,310
Wang Jincun.

402
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,350
Let's welcome him

403
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,277
What's wrong?

404
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,635
Are your fingers frozen?

405
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,638
Do I need to chisel them apart?

406
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,398
Political Officer Wang can read and write

407
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,752
He's your man if you want to write home

408
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,149
Lieutenant Jiao

409
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,708
When we had our victory party at Luoyang

410
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,079
He was nearly choked to death on flapjacks

411
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,391
Lu, Demolition Specialist

412
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,755
Jiang, Sniper

413
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,755
Sergeant Meng

414
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,511
Old Hedgehog

415
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,679
Luo, Machine Gunner

416
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,439
Gong, Ammo Bearer

417
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,835
Call me Blacky

418
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,076
Captain

419
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,591
Captain

420
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,954
I wrote a letter home

421
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,155
I don't know how to write some words

422
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,158
Can the Political Officer fill them in for me?

423
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,710
Get down!

424
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,553
Get in the mine

425
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,394
Hurry, get in the mine, and stay there

426
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,956
Captain

427
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,950
Something doesn't seem right

428
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,916
It is raining shells

429
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,949
Leave two men behind to keep a look out

430
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,400
Tell the rest to get into the mine

431
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,038
Take the Political Officer with you, hurry

432
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,230
Yes, sir

433
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,270
Get up

434
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,675
Follow me

435
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,870
Don't be scared

436
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,432
Hurry into the mine

437
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,520
Yong and Shun, you two stay behind

438
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,675
Hurry up

439
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,916
Get down

440
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,670
Everyone get into the mine

441
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,716
Stay focused

442
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,069
Hurry

443
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,549
What are you praying for?

444
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,313
Are you praying for the firing to stop

445
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,192
So you won't be hit?

446
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,353
Stop screwing around

447
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,756
Pray with me

448
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,631
It works

449
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,159
Show me how to pray

450
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,316
You've killed too many people

451
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,549
Prayers won't do you any good

452
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,677
But they were the enemy

453
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,632
Political Officer

454
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,273
If we make it through this one

455
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,959
Help me write a letter home

456
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,629
But forget it if I'm gone

457
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,989
It'd be less work for me

458
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,275
And less work for you, too

459
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,469
Make way, make way

460
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,193
Just leave him

461
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,748
We'll drag him away later

462
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,710
He's dead

463
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,790
It stopped again

464
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,479
Forget about the time

465
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,188
Just listen for the bugle call

466
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,637
Keep your ears open for the bugle call

467
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,188
Has everyone rested up?

468
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,668
When the bastards come to the door

469
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,555
We'll give them what they deserve

470
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,551
Captain

471
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,432
This new guy's a wimp

472
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,876
Don't worry

473
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,155
He will get over it after seeing some blood

474
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,796
Stay calm

475
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,955
Let them come closer

476
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,116
Fire when the grenades explode

477
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,071
Do you know why dogs bite people?

478
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,191
People smell funny when they're scared

479
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,912
Dogs only bite those who are scared

480
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,510
Bullets are like dogs

481
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,319
They only hit those who are scared

482
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,950
If you aren't scared

483
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,669
The bullets will go around you every time

484
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,475
Check your backpack

485
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,914
Leave the useless stuff behind

486
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,868
Stay calm, wait for my orders

487
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,115
Wait for my order before fire

488
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,073
Do you see their officer?

489
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,355
Let's take him out

490
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,076
I've got him in my sight

491
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,351
Let them get right in front of you

492
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,635
Fire

493
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,875
Reload

494
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,156
Done

495
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,510
Political Officer

496
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,595
Looking good

497
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,360
Brothers

498
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,315
Follow me

499
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,438
Remember where he is, he's all yours

500
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,270
Fire

501
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,069
Medic, come with me

502
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,956
He's dead

503
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,991
Bring the dead into the mine

504
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,517
Yes

505
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,676
Political Officer

506
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,032
Blacky

507
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,636
Blacky, hang in there

508
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,436
Bandages

509
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,470
Bandage it

510
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,230
Let's go

511
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,154
Captain

512
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,392
Retreat!

513
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,233
Retreat, hurry!

514
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,389
Cease fire

515
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,151
Save your ammo

516
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,676
Hedgehog

517
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,069
Have a smoke

518
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,710
Come give me a hand

519
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,231
Help him up, slowly

520
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,559
Eleven dead

521
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,835
Nine wounded

522
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,351
Two seriously wounded won't make it

523
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,919
Forty seven minus eleven

524
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,912
Minus two more

525
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,837
Only thirty four men left

526
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,517
If things keep going like this

527
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,870
We'll all be gone before we hear the bugle call

528
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,152
Get some men

529
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,874
Carry the dead and wounded into the mine

530
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,671
We'll go in

531
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,712
Forget about the dead

532
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,316
They will be blown apart

533
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,556
If we leave them out in the snow

534
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,234
We won't be able to collect the pieces

535
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,356
Hedgehog

536
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,232
Carry the dead and seriously wounded

537
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,629
Into the mine

538
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,719
No one could have saved him

539
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,598
If I get wounded like that

540
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,039
Don't bother with the bandages

541
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,038
Save them for someone who needs them

542
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,911
He's in the way

543
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,789
Take him into the mine

544
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,357
This is his letter home

545
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,272
Finish it for him

546
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,236
Blacky

547
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,513
Your worries are over

548
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,715
Rest in peace

549
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,991
When I was a kid

550
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,598
I tended livestock for a rich family

551
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,189
Take this

552
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,275
I accidentally

553
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,113
Lost their pony

554
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,795
The old bastard

555
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,228
Beat me with a club

556
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,670
After I got home

557
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,430
My father was even angrier

558
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,118
He beat me with a long pole

559
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,753
My family had half an acre of land

560
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,873
We had to hand over half of it

561
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,595
That's not him

562
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,353
I remember he was an officer

563
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,279
Take care of the fields

564
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,356
Look after our elders

565
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,793
It's getting cold

566
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,998
Don't let our son play near the well

567
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,510
The ice is slippery

568
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,637
Don't let our son near the livestock

569
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,637
Don't let him walk behind them

570
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,951
I don't want him injured in the wrong place

571
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,471
Political Officer

572
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,116
That'll do

573
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,469
That's all for now

574
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,590
I'll add a good ending

575
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,874
Wishing the entire family

576
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,716
Peace and happiness

577
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,196
Not bad

578
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,680
After the war

579
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,033
I'm going back home

580
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,111
What about you?

581
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,389
I'm not going back

582
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,676
I've got to make something of myself first

583
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,155
At least I have to get the land back for my dad

584
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,554
Over there

585
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,152
This guy?

586
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,719
Is he wearing a watch?

587
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,075
Yes

588
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,716
Now Captain will know what time it is

589
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,553
Lu

590
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,639
Don't move

591
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,438
Lu

592
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,838
Medic!

593
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,836
Captain

594
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,199
He got a watch for you

595
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,559
Who told you to go?

596
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,430
Who?

597
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,875
We saw your watch was broken

598
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,513
Trade a life for a watch?

599
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,397
For a watch!

600
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,350
Is it worth it?

601
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,475
Lu

602
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,670
Hang in there

603
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,278
Enemy tanks!

604
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,196
Jiang

605
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,839
Move Lu into the mine

606
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,040
Fire after the tanks get closer

607
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,438
Yes

608
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,480
Get the Molotov cocktails ready

609
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,072
Bring them over here

610
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,315
Bring out the mountain gun

611
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,828
Demolition Team

612
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,633
Explosives!

613
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,954
Get the explosives ready!

614
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,229
Hurry, wait for my orders

615
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,873
Aim at the infantry behind the tank

616
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,791
Yes

617
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,238
Point it this way, hurry

618
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,037
Load the shell

619
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,631
When I say fire, pull the cord

620
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,874
Will I be okay?

621
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,349
Lu

622
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,430
You'll be okay

623
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,195
You'll be fine

624
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,153
It's cold

625
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,713
So cold

626
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,999
Lu

627
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,029
So cold

628
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,156
Lu

629
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,076
Warmer now?

630
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,755
Fire

631
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,515
Fire

632
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,030
Fire

633
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,510
Get down

634
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,158
Captain

635
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,558
Fire

636
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,750
Bulls eye!

637
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,676
Give me the torch

638
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,556
Take it

639
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,791
Luozi

640
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,794
Luozi

641
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,917
Don't throw the grenades

642
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,639
Let us get over there first

643
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,040
Go that way, now!

644
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,395
Jiao

645
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,113
It's too dangerous, come back!

646
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,555
Jiao

647
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,835
Jiao

648
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,876
Sergeant

649
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,468
Jiao

650
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,675
Jiang

651
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,269
Jiang!

652
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,991
Jiang!

653
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,313
Wait

654
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,999
Wait

655
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,073
Captain

656
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,992
Listen to me

657
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,590
I just heard the assembly bugle call

658
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,592
Hedgehog

659
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,790
My hearing is not good

660
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,876
What did he say?

661
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,438
He heard the bugle call

662
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,273
You heard the bugle call?

663
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,551
Assembly

664
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,075
They played the Assembly

665
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,593
Who else heard it?

666
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,670
Hedgehog

667
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,835
Did you hear it?

668
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,513
Tell me if you heard it!

669
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,597
I did

670
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,393
Assembly was played

671
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,795
It's been playing all along

672
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,071
You're deaf, you didn't hear it

673
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,316
Captain

674
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,829
Let's go

675
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,997
Get us out of here

676
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,230
Did you hear the bugle call?

677
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,752
The bugle call?

678
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,439
When was it sounded?

679
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,236
Who else heard it?

680
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,959
Did you two hear it?

681
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,595
Did you hear it?

682
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,796
Political Officer

683
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,195
Political Officer!

684
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,955
Tell Captain how many of us are left

685
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,516
Thirty two dead

686
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,153
Louder!

687
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,232
Thirty two dead

688
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,516
Our Company has fifteen men left

689
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,353
Six are seriously wounded

690
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,955
We're all who's left

691
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,514
The two in the mine took care of themselves

692
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,992
I have always listened to you

693
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,432
Listen to me this time

694
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,759
We have to leave

695
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,834
If we don't go

696
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,878
We'll all die

697
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,357
He said

698
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,039
We always listen to you

699
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,196
Listen to him for once

700
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,072
Let's get out of here

701
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,639
If we don't

702
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,438
We'll all be killed

703
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,958
Wang Jincun

704
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,512
You're the 9th Company's Political Officer

705
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,631
I want to hear your advice

706
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,433
Did you hear the bugle call?
