1
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:35,283
There she is.

2
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:40,216
Bonjour, madame. How much for a reading?

3
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,786
Three francs, dear,
and it's written on the door.

4
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,425
I'm sorry.

5
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,610
I cannot see.

6
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:07,107
-We've got to go. We're late.
-We'll miss the bus.

7
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,011
Thank you, madame.

8
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:23,890
What do you see?

9
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,103
I see your 34th year.

10
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:14,944
Shut up.

11
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,684
That's the porter.

12
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,756
He spotted me as I was making my getaway.

13
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,961
These are first-year rooms, aren't they?

14
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,102
They're very luxurious.

15
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:38,067
The ones at Yale are like monk's cells.

16
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:44,572
"Aristotle and Virtue." Oh, God, I'm sorry.

17
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:48,083
-lt doesn't matter.
-Of course it does. I ruined them.

18
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:50,944
Wait.

19
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:58,116
It's getting heavier out there, huh?

20
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:02,460
-Do you mind if I stay here till it eases off?
-No. Of course you can.

21
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,728
-I go out with one of the dons.
-I know. Julian Ellsworth.

22
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:10,561
We just had an awful row.
I can't go back to his rooms.

23
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:14,106
I have to get out of these togs.

24
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:16,709
Excuse me.

25
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:20,440
Help.

26
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:24,211
It's completely stuck to me.

27
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,379
I don't mind if it tears.

28
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:36,058
Thanks.

29
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:41,233
Bless you.

30
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,732
I can't let you go out in this.
You can sleep in my bed.

31
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,008
But we haven't been introduced.

32
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,476
I'll sleep on the chair and keep watch.

33
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,818
That's very noble, but I wouldn't dream
of kidnapping your bed.

34
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:01,486
You're taking a terrible risk
having me here at all.

35
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:26,404
-Sorry.
-No. Don't apologize.

36
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,208
-I'm flattered.
-lt doesn't normally....

37
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:33,252
I should hope it does.

38
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:40,955
-I'm Gilda Besse.
-I know who you are.

39
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,994
-That sounds ominous.
-You're famous around here.

40
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,763
-Where are you from?
-Dublin originally.

41
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:51,402
-We moved up north after the Treaty.
-Why was that?

42
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:54,933
My father was a policeman.

43
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:58,573
And he was killed during the Troubles.

44
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,243
So are you British or lrish?

45
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:07,918
On paper, I'm British.
But I don't believe in countries much.

46
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,320
Nor do l.

47
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:16,961
-How did you end up here?
-I got a scholarship.

48
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,025
Beauty, bravery, and brains.

49
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,142
What a catch.

50
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,145
You also have a nice willy,
and I hope to dream about it.

51
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:43,649
-Good night, Guy.
-Good night.

52
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:15,857
We made it. I owe you my life.

53
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,887
You don't owe me anything. It was fun.

54
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,893
Everyone knew Gilda Besse.

55
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:31,529
Her father owned
one of the big French champagne houses.

56
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:34,405
Her mother was a rich American socialite.

57
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,270
The marriage hadn't lasted...

58
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:39,712
and Gilda had lived most of her life
in the United States.

59
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:42,478
She was quite notorious at Cambridge...

60
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:45,948
and last night,
she had actually slept in my bed.

61
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:49,714
If anyone knew, I'd be a celebrity overnight.

62
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,758
Are you Guy Malyon?

63
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,791
-Yeah.
-Julian Ellsworth.

64
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:05,298
I'm incredibly grateful about the other night.
Gilda said you were a brick.

65
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,968
I really can't thank you enough.
You saved my bacon.

66
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:11,911
I'd have been dismissed and most likely
disinherited if they'd found her here.

67
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:13,380
Glad to have been of help.

68
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:16,111
Listen, we're having a bit of a beano
at the weekend.

69
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,880
Gilda wanted me to invite you.

70
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:19,944
Don't know
if you're much of a jitterbugger...

71
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:22,490
but the old man's away,
I'll have the run of the place.

72
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:24,719
You need a girl, of course.

73
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,589
I can line one up.

74
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:30,029
When I was a freshman,
I didn't know what girls were.

75
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:41,366
I'm afraid Mr. Ellsworth won't allow you in
unless you first drink one of these.

76
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,411
The password is "martini."

77
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:47,372
God, it tastes like paraffin!

78
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,282
One doesn't taste it, darling,
one simply swallows.

79
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:52,013
-New blood.
-Hello, old boy.

80
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,857
You girls should want to dance with me
this evening...

81
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:58,119
because Gilda has got herself
stranded in Calais.

82
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,457
-Poor Gilda.
-Do come through.

83
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,820
Calais is such a dreadful place.

84
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,158
-Hello, Guy.
-Hi.

85
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,825
Glad you could make it.

86
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,858
You're the troubled boy...

87
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:42,597
whose girlfriend
Julian is planning to monster.

88
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,504
-Are you sad?
-I'm thrilled for her.

89
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:47,865
You don't mind if she gets debauched?

90
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:52,403
So long as the debaucher's from a
fucking good family, I couldn't care less.

91
00:10:52,748 --> 00:10:56,514
Do you imagine you're being
incredibly daring using words like that?

92
00:10:56,585 --> 00:11:00,146
You should try them sometime.
It's good for constipation.

93
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,645
I'm going to feel so wicked in the morning.

94
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,348
What are you writing?

95
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,647
An ode to your tummy button.

96
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:48,766
-Gilda.
-Sir Knight.

97
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:52,701
-Don't go up there.
-Why shouldn't I go upstairs?

98
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,272
-There's an orgy going on.
-Sounds promising.

99
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:58,870
My partner for the evening's
the main course.

100
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:02,110
Your partner isn't Molly Twelvetrees,
by any chance, is she?

101
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:05,347
Yeah. She's in danger of catching a cold.

102
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:10,118
-Julian's writing a poem on her stomach.
-What a cad.

103
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:12,149
Don't you mind?

104
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:15,219
I feel sorry for Molly. He's a terrible poet.

105
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,398
You're very modern, aren't you?

106
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:24,495
I don't feel very comfortable here.

107
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,775
I feel guilty being around all this wealth.

108
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:30,073
It's just a game. Don't take it seriously.

109
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:34,873
It's not much of a game if you're out of work
and trying to feed a family.

110
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,014
Fortunately, I'm not.

111
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,283
And neither are you.

112
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,354
I only came here tonight to see you.

113
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:47,857
-There, I've said it.
-Good.

114
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,426
You look lovely.

115
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,402
You don't.

116
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,712
Your eyes are all red.
You look like a bloodhound.

117
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:38,770
You have excellent recuperative powers.

118
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:43,483
-What if someone comes?
-We were here first.

119
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,481
-Oh, God!
-Think Sunday School.

120
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,993
-What?
-Think Sunday School.

121
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:56,553
-Why?
-Because this is a team sport.

122
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,341
Thank you, Unwin.

123
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,875
-I thought it might be prudent to--
-Good idea.

124
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:20,546
Good morning, Unwin.

125
00:14:20,622 --> 00:14:24,456
I thought we might have breakfast
on the terrace this morning.

126
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:27,954
Gilda!
What on earth are you doing down here?

127
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,265
Happy birthday, darling.

128
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:35,603
-Who's that?
-My friend, Guy.

129
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,869
You really had your hands full when I got in.

130
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:41,307
Gilda, he's a virtual primitive.

131
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:45,540
I know. He's the Piltdown man.
I'm planning to exhibit him.

132
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:50,078
-Julian, nothing happened.
-I don't for a moment think anything did.

133
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:53,713
Apart from us writing sonnets
all over each other.

134
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:57,714
All right. Do you mind getting up, please,
before anyone else sees you?

135
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:01,251
Be a darling and lend me
your dressing gown, would you?

136
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:04,258
Gilda, what have you got on under there?

137
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,324
Well, seeing it's your big day...

138
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:09,302
I'm wearing my birthday suit in your honor.

139
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:16,774
I thought for certain I would hear
that Gilda and Julian had broken up...

140
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:19,939
but nothing seemed
to have changed between them.

141
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,412
A few weeks passed...

142
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:26,682
and just when I'd resigned myself
to never being with her again...

143
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:28,985
something unexpected happened.

144
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:35,226
-The divorce was at least 1 2 years ago.
-Yeah, she must be devastated.

145
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:54,313
Can I join?

146
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:59,586
That's five shillings annual membership fee.

147
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:06,924
I read about your mother.
It must have been awful.

148
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:10,829
She was a stranger to me, really.

149
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:17,499
-But how have you been?
-Practicing my billiards.

150
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:23,235
I wanted to see you,
to tell you that I'm leaving England.

151
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:24,603
Why?

152
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,281
The wanderlust has got me. I want to travel.

153
00:16:28,884 --> 00:16:30,374
Where will you go?

154
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,716
I loved the Arabian Nights
when I was younger.

155
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,688
Maybe I'll start there.

156
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:39,252
Would you like a traveling companion?

157
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:42,693
You have to finish your degree.

158
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:49,631
-Does Julian know?
-I'll leave him a nice letter.

159
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:55,334
You're the one friend from this chapter
I'd like to keep.

160
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:03,317
Three weeks later, Gilda left England.

161
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:06,183
And so began
our one-sided correspondence.

162
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:11,121
For she was never in one place long enough
for my letters to catch up with her.

163
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:15,720
After a year, she stopped writing.

164
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:20,594
By the time I graduated and began teaching
in the East End of London...

165
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:23,467
I'd managed to finally put her behind me.

166
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,798
Civil war had broken out in Spain...

167
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,242
and I was campaigning
for the Republican side...

168
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:33,076
in its increasingly desperate fight
against the Fascists.

169
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:38,942
Tiberius is in a bad mood!
Where are those slaves?

170
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:00,808
We'll see how brave you are
in the Coliseum.

171
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:03,474
Take away their drinking water.

172
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:06,741
I hadn't had a letter from her
for almost a year.

173
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,243
But Gilda always
had an uncanny sense of timing.

174
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:12,644
She was back in Paris...

175
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,986
telling me a whole new chapter of her life
was beginning...

176
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,082
and demanding I visit her.

177
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:31,962
Once more, nothing else in the world
existed for me.

178
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:25,984
Bonjour.

179
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,028
Guy! You came! And so soon!

180
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,695
Well, you finally sent me an address.

181
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:43,935
Look at you. Suddenly you're a man.

182
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:45,639
I even shave now.

183
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:49,809
-How long can you stay?
-Only till tomorrow. I have to work.

184
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,819
That's ridiculous.
You have to stay for at least a month.

185
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,095
-You'll be able to see my show.
-What sort of show?

186
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,058
You'll see tonight.

187
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:10,434
I saw you in a film as a slave
in ancient Rome.

188
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,707
-Wasn't it ludicrous?
-How did you get the part?

189
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:17,734
I met an American cameraman
and went back to Hollywood with him.

190
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,773
At first I wanted to be an actress...

191
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,750
but then I got more interested in cameras.

192
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,451
I'd pick his brains in bed every night.

193
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:36,259
Are you married yet?

194
00:20:36,898 --> 00:20:38,525
-Not quite.
-Good.

195
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:42,134
I'm sure you have a menagerie of admirers.

196
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:47,368
-So what do you do after work?
-I raise money for Republican Spain.

197
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,672
I forgot you had a conscience.

198
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:53,444
Max! This is Guy.

199
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,378
He just arrived from London.

200
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:02,388
Welcome to Paris.
Are you here for the opening?

201
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:06,216
He doesn't know anything about it,
so he'll be completely objective.

202
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,454
Right.

203
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:10,326
Where are you staying?

204
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:13,162
There's a hotel my friends like,
just around the corner.

205
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:14,895
He's staying here.

206
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:18,634
He and Mia can sing each other to sleep.

207
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:20,366
Good.

208
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,610
This is going to be incredibly glamorous,
isn't it?

209
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:25,976
And I'm going to be incredibly dowdy.

210
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:28,447
You're British. People expect it.

211
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:30,282
Do you mind?

212
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:44,325
So Max is a lover?

213
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,429
He owns the gallery.

214
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:49,332
Actually, he's good company...

215
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:52,898
but he's become
extremely proprietorial lately.

216
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,708
-He's on very thin ice.
-Then I hope it melts.

217
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:02,013
Don't sulk.

218
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,545
I didn't know you were coming so soon.

219
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:08,188
And anyway...

220
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,151
I'm sure you're not sleeping alone
in London every night.

221
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:57,904
Moments of yearning. Lust, vanity, and joy.

222
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,938
Loves won and lost.

223
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:04,577
It's an honor to be the first to host
the work...

224
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,978
of this gifted new photographer.

225
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:12,051
Finally, as a bonus,
may I present a living sculpture...

226
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,418
created especially for tonight?

227
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:11,071
The pictures were good of their kind.
But the sculptures were something else.

228
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,511
The trouble is we're never going
to see them again.

229
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:17,039
You should film them, Gilda.
Record them for posterity.

230
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:20,118
They need to be live,
so people can lean over...

231
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:22,588
and smell the skin of the models.

232
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,785
Does that worry you, Mia?

233
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,761
Having people sniffing around you
like dogs?

234
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,898
I'm a sculpture, so I ignore them.

235
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,334
What about you, Guy?

236
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:37,303
Have you seen anything like that
in England?

237
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:39,095
No, I haven't.

238
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:41,900
Guy thinks art should be political.

239
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:46,310
In London, he spends most of his time
campaigning for Republican Spain.

240
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:49,650
German artists spent the last 15 years
lampooning the Nazis...

241
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:51,184
and had no effect at all.

242
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:53,015
At least they tried.

243
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:56,689
Rather pointless if all they achieve
is a ticket to one of those camps.

244
00:24:56,758 --> 00:25:01,252
And the satisfaction of knowing
they had the courage of their convictions.

245
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:08,162
Here's to judicious cowardice.

246
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:12,900
No. Here's to Mia,
whose beauty inspired us all.

247
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:18,303
You should model for Coco Chanel.
I could introduce you.

248
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,175
Mia's training to be a nurse.

249
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,746
She only models in her spare time,
and I have an exclusive contract.

250
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:28,721
But I do feel I've seen you before.
I never forget a face.

251
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:32,215
Perhaps you saw me at Le Grand Jeu.

252
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:38,255
So how do you carry on
your crusade for Spain?

253
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,993
Do you sit on a committee
and hand out pamphlets in the street?

254
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,004
And if you really feel so strongly...

255
00:25:44,072 --> 00:25:46,404
why don't you enlist
in the lnternational Brigades?

256
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:48,237
I plan to at the end of school term.

257
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,504
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I am.

258
00:25:51,212 --> 00:25:53,407
Well, the line must be drawn.

259
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:56,743
Fascism must be stopped
before it engulfs us all.

260
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:58,183
Good night.

261
00:26:00,154 --> 00:26:04,215
-You've become so serious.
-The world has become serious.

262
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,050
We'll all die of gravity.

263
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:11,524
I'm sorry I can't be with you tonight.

264
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:14,463
-Do you even like him?
-Occasionally.

265
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:20,232
But I admit,
he's trying a little too hard at the moment.

266
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:23,940
Mia, get out of the bath!
You'll turn into a prune!

267
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,312
I take it Le Grand Jeu is a cabaret?

268
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:30,408
Burlesque. Striptease.

269
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:33,954
She came here with nothing.
She's my protege.

270
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,622
I want the three of us to be friends.

271
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,556
Gilda, are you coming?

272
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:56,969
I'll see you in the morning.

273
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:10,389
This one's comfortable.

274
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,855
I used to sleep here when I first came.

275
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:17,428
-How long have you been here?
-Half a year.

276
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:20,130
Whereabouts in Spain are you from?

277
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:23,136
Asturias. In the north.

278
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:30,840
Don't be jealous. He's not special to her.

279
00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:33,373
None of them are.

280
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:55,565
He wants you to hear.

281
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,528
He's afraid of her feelings for you.

282
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,336
Yeah, well, I'm afraid of mine for her.

283
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:25,229
-Who is it?
-It's me.

284
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:31,438
How dare you be so pathetically
melodramatic walking out on me like that?

285
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:34,231
What's there to drink? I'm bone dry.

286
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:40,206
Hello.

287
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:44,610
-This is Linda.
-Hello, Gilda.

288
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm sorry I woke you.

289
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:50,384
I got seasick on the boat...

290
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:54,019
and then I tried to eat something
to settle my stomach...

291
00:28:54,095 --> 00:28:56,723
but the food in this country is awful.

292
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:02,969
-ls this a bad time?
-What do you think?

293
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:09,103
Does Max know you're here?

294
00:29:09,177 --> 00:29:12,613
Max was being very boring about you,
so I expelled him.

295
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:16,275
I'm not going to let you go
and get yourself killed.

296
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,545
You'd probably come back
with your brain shot out.

297
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:21,486
Conversations would be
incredibly one-sided.

298
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,953
Now, get me a blanket
and you can go back to bed.

299
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:34,364
-What are you doing?
-I'm going.

300
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:38,463
She's sleeping in there.
I'm just getting her some bedclothes.

301
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:41,440
Guy, I was with you at the cinema.

302
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:44,468
After you saw her,
you hardly spoke the rest of the day.

303
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:48,777
And when you got her letter,
you couldn't get on a train fast enough.

304
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,645
I'm off.

305
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:54,781
-There's no need.
-I've got an early start in the morning.

306
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:58,216
And besides, I think I'm a bit in the way.

307
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:13,905
-You didn't ask her to leave, did you?
-No.

308
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:18,370
Seeing as she has,
I suppose I don't have to sleep rough.

309
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:49,609
You've no idea
how I adored you at Cambridge.

310
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:53,441
And when I arrived here,
nothing had changed.

311
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,542
It was miraculous.

312
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,275
I couldn't stand lying
on the other side of that door...

313
00:30:58,352 --> 00:31:02,015
Iistening to you and your lover, though.
That was torture.

314
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:03,488
Don't worry.

315
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:10,230
I'm still in good voice.

316
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,591
By the time we're finished...

317
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,866
you'll be so conceited,
you'll be insufferable.

318
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:29,949
How do you like my tie?

319
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,787
It's perfect.

320
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,227
So how did you and Mia meet?

321
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:58,663
I saw her on the street.
Followed her to a cafe.

322
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,037
You choose people, don't you?
"Come into my life."

323
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:07,872
Sometimes you see complete strangers,
but there's something special about them...

324
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:10,416
and you think,
"l should really try and talk to them...

325
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:13,385
"because I'll never see them again,"
but you don't...

326
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:15,285
because it's not done.

327
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:17,324
But it's all fated, anyway.

328
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:20,792
It had to be your room
I came into that night in Cambridge.

329
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,328
What do you mean?

330
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:26,025
The whole room was familiar.
I'd seen it before in dreams.

331
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:29,992
It probably reminded you of some place
you've been before.

332
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:32,164
We just think we've dreamt things.

333
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,036
You're so complacent!

334
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:37,839
The mind isn't a physical thing
like the rest of the body.

335
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:42,144
Maybe it can jump forward in dreams.
Maybe it doesn't have to obey physical laws.

336
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,945
But if my room was already there...

337
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:47,385
then that would mean
everything was fixed in advance.

338
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:54,217
You think I was being spontaneous...

339
00:33:54,762 --> 00:33:56,923
but I was always going to do that.

340
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:00,091
Just as I was always
going to win this argument.

341
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:19,383
That's what I learned at school.

342
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:21,680
I've got to work out what I'm going to do.

343
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:24,815
-Resign from your teaching for a start.
-And what do I live on?

344
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:28,259
-I'll give you a job as my assistant.
-How's the pay?

345
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,057
Good bonuses.

346
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,326
I listen to them every night.

347
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:35,626
-Do we keep you awake?
-She can sleep through anything.

348
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:39,230
She has amazing conversations in her sleep.
Three or four people.

349
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:42,002
Sometimes speaking different languages.

350
00:34:43,544 --> 00:34:45,205
So, do you accept?

351
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:00,185
You odious little boy. How's that?

352
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:03,321
Now the horrible little girl
has turned around.

353
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,955
Hello. We're just off to the pictures.

354
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,735
So, Guy...

355
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:48,364
you have forsaken London
for the City of Light?

356
00:35:48,442 --> 00:35:49,841
It seems so.

357
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,102
Mia!

358
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:57,046
-Change in here.
-Why?

359
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,018
He came to the exhibition.

360
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,418
He won't be seeing anything
he hasn't seen before.

361
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:05,117
You were part of my sculpture.
You're flesh and blood now.

362
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,925
What are you doing
going out with him, anyway?

363
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:09,394
I'm curious.

364
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:11,522
You know what they say about him.

365
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,999
You should hear what they say about you.

366
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:19,939
Your dresser has excelled herself.

367
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:24,736
-So you're having dinner afterwards?
-We haven't decided.

368
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,014
-What time should I bring her back?
-Shut up.

369
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:31,378
-See you both later.
-Bonsoir.

370
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:25,063
You're a very lucky man,
living with two beautiful women.

371
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,503
But Gilda still doesn't approve of me.

372
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:33,637
Sometimes I think she's jealous.

373
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:41,019
You seem to have a calming influence
on her.

374
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:45,086
She used to move in wild circles,
but I'm sure you know that.

375
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,660
-And you don't care.
-No, I don't.

376
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:51,926
Very commendable.
The past and the future are irrelevant.

377
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,729
The moment is everything.

378
00:37:55,903 --> 00:37:59,532
You know, at first I thought
you were an idealist, a bore.

379
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:01,904
But you're one of us, after all.

380
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:48,885
Tell me, as one man to another...

381
00:38:50,491 --> 00:38:53,255
what does Gilda like in bed?

382
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:56,960
As one man to another?

383
00:38:57,698 --> 00:38:59,893
That's none of your business.

384
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:12,036
Come on, Mia. Dance for us.

385
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:15,811
-Please?
-It's Christmas.

386
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,748
-Come on.
-All right.

387
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:20,611
Why not?

388
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:33,489
What are you two talking about?

389
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:38,192
-You.
-And what are you saying?

390
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:43,970
What are you saying?

391
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:53,604
It's past 4:00.
We've almost lost Christmas Day. Come on.

392
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,147
I'm starving.

393
00:41:02,122 --> 00:41:06,491
An American turkey made an ill-starred
bid for freedom at Whipsnade Zoo today...

394
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,621
only to touch down in the
arctic fox enclosure with mixed results.

395
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:14,161
A happy ending for the fox,
less so for the turkey.

396
00:41:14,935 --> 00:41:16,732
The weather in....

397
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,193
I'm sorry. I don't understand a word.

398
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,693
You don't need to.

399
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:44,626
If an animal made those sounds,
you'd know it was evil.

400
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:47,599
All he's saying is that
when Greater Germany is restored...

401
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,727
he'll have no other territorial claims.

402
00:41:49,803 --> 00:41:51,566
And you believe him?

403
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:07,820
I used to paint pictures of all these places
when I was home from boarding school.

404
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:10,584
-Can I see them?
-I threw them all away.

405
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:14,718
I had no talent of my own.
I just wanted to be van Gogh.

406
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,537
-Bonjour, Francoise.
-Bonjour, mademoiselle.

407
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:33,971
What are you doing, Father?

408
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:37,048
I am saving the lives of insects.

409
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:40,048
I've never seen you so compassionate.

410
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,854
I don't like the popping sounds they make.

411
00:42:42,923 --> 00:42:45,255
Why are you wearing your uniform?

412
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:47,953
There was a rally in Rheims,
the Croix-de-Feu.

413
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:51,622
Our Popular Front is not
quite so popular here in the country.

414
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:54,098
The world is veering towards Moscow...

415
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:57,796
which is a little worrying
for us minor landowners.

416
00:42:58,772 --> 00:43:01,935
But politics has never been
one of my daughter's stronger points.

417
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:03,408
Take your feet off the couch.

418
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,240
-Charles Besse.
-Guy Malyon.

419
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:07,075
You'll be joining us for dinner?

420
00:43:11,852 --> 00:43:14,685
Guy recently moved here from England.

421
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,788
So, how's the acting?

422
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:22,156
I only did that one film.
It was never going to be a career.

423
00:43:22,863 --> 00:43:25,058
Whatever next? I can't keep up with her.

424
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:27,464
First it was dance,
and her room was full of ballet.

425
00:43:27,534 --> 00:43:31,527
Then she discovers Stendhal, and,
of course, she wants to be a great novelist.

426
00:43:31,605 --> 00:43:33,835
And then there was what, painting?

427
00:43:33,907 --> 00:43:38,469
One thing I learned from you, Father,
was never to dwell on one's mistakes.

428
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,371
-Where's my stepmother?
-She's probably out walking the dogs.

429
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:47,887
What happened to that Max fellow?

430
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:49,918
A light of other days.

431
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:54,086
I sired a dilettante,
in every aspect of her life.

432
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:58,930
That's why I resent you,
for bequeathing me such superficial genes.

433
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:33,759
They say a winemaker's taste
is the last of his senses to desert him.

434
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:37,700
But Gilda tells me
that you're not much interested in wine.

435
00:44:37,771 --> 00:44:40,740
-I was brought up on Guinness.
-We drink Guinness in France.

436
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:43,799
-Very good for an upset stomach.
-The old hair of the dog.

437
00:44:43,877 --> 00:44:45,071
Indeed.

438
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:51,882
Why, Gilda,
you're looking very fetching tonight.

439
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:56,289
She likes to startle me
by wearing her mother's things.

440
00:44:56,356 --> 00:44:59,018
I think she intends to make me feel guilty.

441
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:01,754
You see,
she blames me for her mother's death.

442
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:04,588
I don't blame you, Father.

443
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:07,232
Fate deals some people a rotten hand,
that's all.

444
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,997
Fate is an excuse for people
who suffer a failure of nerve.

445
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:14,531
-So it was her fault, was it?
-No, not at all.

446
00:45:14,608 --> 00:45:18,738
It's absolutely and completely my fault.
I am an insensitive brute.

447
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,108
You see, darling? You married a beast.

448
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:27,416
I married a beast because I'm a huntress.

449
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:30,547
And if I can't tame you, I'll shoot you.

450
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:34,460
Then I must mend my ways.

451
00:45:37,998 --> 00:45:40,831
Isn't your birthday coming up soon, dear?

452
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:44,461
Now, we must do something
to celebrate this year.

453
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:47,733
You know I never celebrate my birthdays.

454
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:52,404
If you're afraid of birthdays already,
you'll be a wreck when you're my age.

455
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:58,140
I can't imagine ever being that old.

456
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:01,713
Thank you, Gilda.

457
00:46:19,206 --> 00:46:22,733
There's something about that house
that turns me into a monster.

458
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:25,937
I didn't like his politics,
but I enjoyed the repartee.

459
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:28,537
He ends up humiliating all his women.

460
00:46:28,615 --> 00:46:31,209
You saw her, how hard she was trying.

461
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:35,513
All he wants her for
is to show her off to his shooting friends.

462
00:46:40,994 --> 00:46:42,552
Mia, we're back.

463
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:52,661
That bastard.

464
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:06,415
-You don't have to go to work today.
-I'm all right.

465
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:08,944
I'm all right.

466
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:21,192
-Should we tell the police?
-She was a striptease dancer.

467
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:23,799
They'd say she asked for it.

468
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,738
-Then I'll go round and see him myself.
-And end up in a cell?

469
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,699
He has powerful friends.

470
00:47:32,712 --> 00:47:35,272
Lucien? Gilda Besse.

471
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,051
Mia doesn't know I'm calling.

472
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,179
She got a little carried away the other night.

473
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,084
Yes, that's right.

474
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:49,318
I like it the way you do.

475
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:52,530
And I'm stronger than she is.

476
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,225
-I thought we should meet.
-I see.

477
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,769
-Guy?
-Yeah?

478
00:47:59,005 --> 00:48:02,532
Max wants to have lunch today.
He wants to talk about another exhibition.

479
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:04,941
-Do you mind?
-No, of course not.

480
00:48:05,011 --> 00:48:08,447
You should take Mia to a film or something.
She needs to get out.

481
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:10,779
-That's a good idea.
-Maybe a comedy.

482
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:30,688
I thought you might change your mind.

483
00:49:30,764 --> 00:49:33,528
My English friend tells me
I'm very stubborn.

484
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,263
-I assume he doesn't know where you are?
-No one does.

485
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:40,436
Perhaps I should lock the door.

486
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:50,747
Why did you decide to become a nurse?

487
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,552
I wanted to be a dancer.

488
00:49:54,788 --> 00:49:57,621
My father was a coal miner. An anarchist.

489
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:01,454
Our house was full of politics all the time...

490
00:50:01,528 --> 00:50:04,429
but I would always be running away
to dance.

491
00:50:06,399 --> 00:50:10,233
Two years ago, they declared
a Socialist Republic in Asturias.

492
00:50:12,472 --> 00:50:15,202
A house in our street became a hospital.

493
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:18,310
I tried to help, but I didn't know anything.

494
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:20,272
And people were...

495
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:22,808
dying in my arms.

496
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:27,044
And then the soldiers came.

497
00:50:28,288 --> 00:50:33,021
I tried to stop them from taking my brother,
and that's when they hurt my leg.

498
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:37,260
After that, I knew I couldn't be a dancer.

499
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:41,793
And I wanted to help people.

500
00:50:44,537 --> 00:50:47,028
So that's why I am becoming a nurse...

501
00:50:47,107 --> 00:50:49,837
and why I need to go back to my country.

502
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:09,508
-Hello.
-How did it go?

503
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:13,519
-lt was fine.
-You're doing another exhibition?

504
00:53:13,953 --> 00:53:18,287
We played around with a few different ideas.
I did most of the talking.

505
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:22,757
Why are you two looking so miserable?
Trois cognacs.

506
00:53:23,296 --> 00:53:25,161
We saw a newsreel on Spain.

507
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:27,358
You were supposed to be cheering her up.

508
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:28,627
It was my idea.

509
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:31,670
We wanted to see what else was going on
in the world.

510
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:33,771
There will always be wars...

511
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,741
while there are people dying to be martyrs.

512
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,809
Go on. Say how guilty you feel.

513
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:44,573
Afterwards, we sat out in the gardens.

514
00:53:44,651 --> 00:53:48,382
I'm serious.
You need to get it out of your system.

515
00:53:48,588 --> 00:53:50,783
Because you feel guilty
that life is good here...

516
00:53:50,857 --> 00:53:53,690
while terrible things are happening there.

517
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,527
After you've talked about it, you'll feel
better because you've shown you care.

518
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,962
To you...

519
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:04,836
for getting rid of that vile man.

520
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:07,236
And you...

521
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:10,572
for getting rid of your guilt.

522
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:13,607
-To us.
-To us.

523
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:19,883
You live in a cocoon.
You don't think about the world outside.

524
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:23,216
I give my allegiance to those around me.

525
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:25,754
We share the world,
whether we like it or not.

526
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:30,387
You can share my bed as long as you don't
bring your newsreels or newspapers into it.

527
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,928
Marry me.

528
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,802
-What?
-I'm serious.

529
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:55,848
If I woke one morning
and you'd turned into a husband, I'd flee.

530
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:58,552
How would it be any different?

531
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:01,457
Once people get married, they stop trying.

532
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:06,061
-Anyway, you would want to have children.
-One day.

533
00:55:08,935 --> 00:55:12,063
You should have one with Mia.
He'd be beautiful.

534
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,236
Sometimes you say the first thing
that comes into your head.

535
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:18,402
Should I censor what I say?

536
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:20,946
If I had a child, I'd have it with you.

537
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:25,313
My mother was mad. You've met my father.
I have doomed genes.

538
00:55:30,223 --> 00:55:32,157
You talk such nonsense.

539
00:55:58,151 --> 00:55:59,641
What's wrong?

540
00:56:02,288 --> 00:56:06,622
Things are getting worse in Spain.
There are friends of mine there now.

541
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:10,454
And you want to go get yourself killed, too,
in someone else's war?

542
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:12,522
It's not someone else's war.

543
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,582
It's as much ours
as if it was happening here.

544
00:56:18,062 --> 00:56:20,223
We all share the same world.

545
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:56,562
Any trained nurses they'll take at once.
I've got an address for you to go to.

546
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,436
Who'll take any trained nurses at once?

547
00:57:07,778 --> 00:57:09,245
I'm going to Spain.

548
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:11,907
I didn't want to say anything
until it was definite.

549
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:14,576
And it's time for me to go back, too.

550
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,254
They need nurses there.

551
00:57:20,057 --> 00:57:22,685
We've been living together for a year.

552
00:57:23,093 --> 00:57:27,029
Am I such an ogre that you can't even
discuss your plans with me?

553
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:28,655
I didn't see much point.

554
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:32,862
You didn't see much point in talking about
throwing away your life?

555
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:35,672
And taking Mia with you?

556
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:40,974
I was always going to go back
once I became a nurse.

557
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:43,439
You would just never listen.

558
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,847
Of course. I should have seen it coming.

559
00:57:51,622 --> 00:57:53,749
You feed each other's guilt.

560
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,689
It's like a disease.

561
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,496
Thank God it hasn't infected me.

562
00:58:23,287 --> 00:58:25,949
Gilda's father was traveling in America...

563
00:58:26,023 --> 00:58:30,050
and as a kind of farewell,
we spent the last week at the Chateau.

564
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:34,153
The sense of our departure
hung over every moment...

565
00:58:34,231 --> 00:58:37,689
though it was never mentioned again
until the last day.

566
00:58:45,843 --> 00:58:47,708
I can't drink any more.

567
00:58:48,579 --> 00:58:50,069
Yes, you can.

568
00:58:53,017 --> 00:58:54,985
We're drinking for all those times...

569
00:58:55,052 --> 00:58:57,850
we won't be able to drink together again.

570
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:06,223
There'll be periods of leave
when I can come back to Paris.

571
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:11,563
I wouldn't want to see you
if you came back with some hideous injury.

572
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:15,502
Come on, we're still drinking.
You're not going to sleep.

573
00:59:15,572 --> 00:59:17,699
-Wake up.
-I'm tired.

574
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:21,740
Gilda, you're drunk.

575
00:59:38,629 --> 00:59:40,893
Why do you have to go as well?

576
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,353
Traitor.
