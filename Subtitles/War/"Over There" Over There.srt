That's all you gotta say is no?

The lieutenant's a fool.

That's why.

But back in boot, when they
heard I went to Cornell...

200
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,837
they figured I had to be stupid
to end up in the army anyway.

201

So... that's why.

- I'm goin' to college.
- Oh, yeah?

203
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,942
Yeah. I got me a scholarship
to play football at Texas A&M.

But I couldn't afford it,
so I signed up.

I'm gonna see if I can't play
on the kick-off coverage team at least.
