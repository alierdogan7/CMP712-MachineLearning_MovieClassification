Close your eyes while I pray for you.

177
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:36,781
Dear Lord...

178
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,124
Amen.

180
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:53,634
MAN: Go get 'em, Alden.

181
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,272
Scottie?

182
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,413
How's it going? Huh?

183
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,581
All right.

184
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,708
I like your hair.

185
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:36,516
- Yeah, I like yours too.
- Yeah?

186
00:14:39,393 --> 00:14:42,429
- Superintendents, huh?
- Yeah.

187
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,563
It's hard to imagine
Dad ever being young like us.

188
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,572
Yeah, well. He might have been
young like you.

189
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:50,702
He was never young like me.

190
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,931
At my age he was already
married and had me.

191
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:59,408
Well, he was in a hurry to get old.
That's not my trip.

192
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,705
I keep trying to picture myself...

193
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:08,876
getting out...

194
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,171
and getting married.

195
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,006
Having a real job, but...

196
00:15:16,972 --> 00:15:19,511
I just can't see it.

197
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:27,190
So, how's your love life, huh?
You getting any?

198
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:28,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

199
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,280
Yeah, I've been doing that
a long time now.

200
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:35,106
No shit?
I didn't get laid till I was almost 20.

201
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,948
Really? That's a drag.

202
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,953
Yeah.

203
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,916
Well, I guess I was on a slow trip, huh?

204
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,459
Hey, come here.

205
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,634
Get down here.

206
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,896
What do you think of my car, huh?

207
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,934
- It's OK.
- Yeah? Yeah? Tell me the truth.

208
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,684
- It's a piece of shit, Alden.
- Yeah?

209
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,277
Well.

210
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,446
It's yours.

211
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,907
I don't want it.

212
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:20,158
Well, I'm... I'm giving it
to you, Scott.

213
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,745
I don't want your car, Alden.

214
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:28,047
Look, you can trade it in
on something else, then.

215
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:34,009
- It's OK. I like hitchhiking.
- Then park the car and hitchhike.

216
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:37,008
Look. I'm trying to be nice to you.

217
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,479
What, you trying to make up
for being a prick to me all my life?

218
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,763
Scott. You're my only brother.

219
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:47,686
Alden, you might have
everybody impressed.

220
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:49,895
You come in here like some big hero,

221
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,148
in your little uniform
and your little boy's haircut.

222
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:57,943
I don't buy it for a minute. You haven't
said a word to me in three years.

223
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:02,411
You're only being nice to me
cos you're chickenshit about Vietnam.

224
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,953
Shut up.

225
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,424
Alden!

226
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,753
Scottie!

227
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:19,388
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

228
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,270
Just getting to know each other.

229
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,899
I was wondering if I could have that.

230
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,401
Yeah. Sure.

231
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,868
You must be really
proud of your brother.

232
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:45,456
Yeah. Wanna come with me?
Shoot a few Cong?

233
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,541
No. It's not my war.
I don't care about it.

234
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,713
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,464
It's bullshit.

236
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:05,562
Apologise to your brother.

237
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,737
I'm sorry. But it's bullshit.

238
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:14,647
It doesn't matter, Dad.
Everyone's entitled to his own opinion.

239
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:17,322
Not that kind of opinion.

240
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,590
We should get going, huh?

241
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,964
I was thinking we could
throw the football around.

242
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,926
The three of us.

243
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,096
You know?

244
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,222
Call Ralph.

245
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:47,688
Have a little fun.

246
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,235

- What are you talking about? Come on.

00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:28,773
I have to run before it gets dark.
It might rain.

250
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:32,568
You exercise too much, Jessie.
You're gonna give us all a complex.

251
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:35,616

No. To not get drafted.
That's why we came to college.

Oh, good. Good.

I heard a story about this guy
who went in for his physical, right?

316
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:05,663
Put a candy bar up his ass.
And the doctor says "What is that?"

- "Oh, that's shit, Doc."
- Did he get out?

319

Yeah. They don't want
any shit eaters in the army.

OK, Ralph. I don't have to help you.
But let me tell you something.

If you flunk out and die in Vietnam,
that's the end of our friendship. Fuck you.

How you doing? Did this one tell you?

- Salutatorian. Know what that means?

339

- No. I don't know what that means.
- That means she studies, you.

What are these clothes?
Is this what I pay for?

341
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:48,564

before I spank you.

- Mom, what are you doing here?
- I just came along for the ride.
