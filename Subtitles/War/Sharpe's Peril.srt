1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,340
WOMEN SCREAMING

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,220
BABIES CRYING

3
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,820
TRUMPET

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
You, soldier,

5
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,580
dance with me.

6
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,580
I do not dance.

7
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,900
Do not, sir? Or cannot?

8
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,980
Will not, then. If it please you.

9
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
It does not please me.

10
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,940
WOMEN'S LAUGHTER

11
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,340
I am resolved to step a measure
with every man here present.

12
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,580
And have a wager of my friends to do
the same.

13
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,740
What do you say to that?

14
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,620
You lose.

15
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,340
Not lost your touch with the ladies,
then?

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,700
What the hell are we doing here
anyway?

17
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,020
You saw the dispatch. Aye, the
governor requests your presence.

18
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,820
But why? I thought we were headed
home. We are, Pat.

19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
We are, I promise.

20
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,700
Colonel Sharpe?

21
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,220
One moment, sir.

22
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,820
Damn the man, damn him to hell.

23
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,660
God rot all quill suckers, heh?

24
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,660
We sweat and bleed and die upon
their whim.

25
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,820
And for what thanks?

26
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,100
If it's gratitude you're after,
then you've joined the wrong army.

27
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,180
You may well be right at that.

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,220
Colonel?

29
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,300
Sharp. Richard Sharpe.

30
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,860
Count Vladimir Alexei Dragomirov,
3rd Native Horse.

31
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,100
You have business with the governor?

32
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,980
Tread lightly.
Sedgefield is a wily, old devil.

33
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,820
Your Excellency, Colonel Sharpe.

34
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,220
Colonel,
His Excellency Viscount Sedgefield.

35
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,820
I'm told you have a nose
for mischief, Colonel Sharpe.

36
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,860
Told, sir?

37
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,740
His Grace, Lord Wellington.

38
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,300
After this late rebellion,
only recently put down,

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,700
we find ourselves, alas,
already facing fresh dangers.

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,660
Bandits, Sharpe, in the high hills.

41
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,140
Under the thrall of a cutthroat
named Chitu.

42
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,860
Causing no end of havoc
with Company operations.

43
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,940
Villages put to fire and sword.

44
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,100
The harvest disrupted.

45
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,660
Sorry to hear that.
Indeed.

46
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,580
A Company squadron
under Count Dragomirov

47
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,660
has been dispatched
to find this Chitu.

48
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,820
And, so far, without success.

49
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,420
You are requested

50
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,740
upon the highest authority,
to do better.

51
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,060
I am no longer
in the service of His Majesty.

52
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,340
My business in India concluded.
I am for Calcutta and England.

53
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,300
I cannot persuade you?

54
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,060
Perhaps then,

55
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,860
might at least you be prevailed upon
to perform one last duty?

56
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,940
In which, I assure you,

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,940
there is no peril to yourself.

58
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,020
Aye.

59
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,020
If I can.

60
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,380
I have in my care a property.

61
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,180
Like yourself, bound for the north.

62
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,540
May I look to you for its safe
conveyance?

63
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,940
Aye. Very well.

64
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,820
Your word?

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,380
What is it, this property?

66
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,660
Ah, Colonel Sharpe,

67
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,580
I have the honour to present
Mademoiselle Marie-Angelique Bonnet.

68
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,820
Who is she?
Damned if I know.

69
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,020
Her fiance is a Company major,
name of Joubert.

70
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,100
Stationed at Kalimgong.

71
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,580
Where, in God's arse, is Kalimgong?

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,620
Company hill station,

73
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,500
on the way, Sedgefield says.

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,700
SIMPLE TUNE

75
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,020
SOLDIERS SINGING

76
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,820
Major Tredinnick, sahib.

77
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,260
Marvellous, marvellous.

78
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Who commands this column?

79
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,980
Why, sir, no man.

80
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,900
All men.

81
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,820
We are, you might say, a regular
Captain Copperthorne's crew.

82
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,420
A gentleman asks a civil question,
he expects an answer in kind

83
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,380
and none of your riddles.

84
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,900
What he means to say, sir, after his
fashion, is the matter

85
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,860
would depend on whether you meant
Company troops or king's.

86
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,860
For we number both amongst the
column.

87
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,220
Your officer will do for now.
Very good.

88
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,980
I'd be glad if our mounts could be
fed and watered.

89
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,020
And someone to see to the lady's
comforts also.

90
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,940
Quilter, Deever.
This way, gentlemen.

91
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,900
How is it you come to be travelling
along Company's routes.

92
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,620
I was ordered, sir.
There's bandits hereabouts,

93
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,780
all manner of heathen deviltry.

94
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,820
Sooner than have troops venture
forth in small bands,

95
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,020
we thought it best
to combine all soldiery

96
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,180
samewise bound into one column.

97
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,380
Mind how you tread,
that is elephant shit.

98
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,900
These gentlemen were hoping
to speak with you, sir.

99
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,420
Very good, Colour Wormwood.
Would you want me to remain, sir?

100
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,660
In case there's any questions?
I'm sufficient to the task.

101
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,620
Very good, sir.

102
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,860
You'll forgive Colour Wormwood's
familiarity, gentlemen.

103
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,140
Being not long in India, I find
myself beneath his wing.

104
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,860
Ensign Beauclere, 69th Foot.

105
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,580
Colonel Richard Sharpe,
late of the South Essex.

106
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,740
Sergeant Major Harper.

107
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,100
Your pardon, Colonel... You may
dispense with formalities.

108
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,140
I hold no present commission.

109
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,100
Mr Harper and myself are about

110
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,820
some private business on the
governor's request.

111
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,020
And yourself?

112
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,140
I command a small prisoner escort,
sir.

113
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,300
Bound for Calcutta.

114
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,500
I'd hardly call such numbers small,
Mr Beauclere.

115
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,700
What have you in your charge?
Some regicide?

116
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,660
No, sir. You misapprehend me.

117
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,140
For the most part,
what you see here

118
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,300
is the royal train of the Maharani
Padmini Devi of Jhalawar.

119
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,420
A princess?

120
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,580
Her highness travels to Pankot

121
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,780
under protection of Company
detachment.

122
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,980
With Subedar Pillai commanding.

123
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,260
As for regicide, I fear my prisoner
is in no mean so worthy of note.

124
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,300
So what was the offence?

125
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,260
The murder of an officer, sir,

126
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,140
in furtherance to robbery of the
regimental stores.

127
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,860
Oh.

128
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,620
The commissariat sets great store
by its spoons, so it does.

129
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,540
Subedar Pillai, then...

130
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,140
..is in charge
of the safety of this column.

131
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,260
Do it.

132
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Do it, man!

133
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,180
Not like that, you'll kill him.

134
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,580
You've got the blade
the wrong way round.

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,300
You need to line it up
along the vein, not across it.

136
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,940
Are you a farrier? I know how to
bleed a horse without killing it.

137
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,820
What are you waiting for, then?
Do it.

138
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,820
Hold onto that.

139
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,380
Right.

140
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Keep the bugger steady, Pat.

141
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,380
He's fine.

142
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,460
Easy, boy. Take it nice and easy.

143
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,380
Easy now.

144
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,220
WHINNYING

145
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,420
Easy, boy.

146
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,540
Just keep him there, Pat,
keep him there.

147
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,020
I reckon you'll live.

148
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,180
We are most grateful, Mr...?

149
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Sharpe. Colonel Sharpe.

150
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,140
Sergeant Major Harper.

151
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,420
For future, a wee bit of ginger
added to his feed might help, ma'am.

152
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,060
Ask what reward you will of Subedar
Pillai for your service.

153
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,820
It shall be met. The beast out of
his misery is reward enough, ma'am.

154
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,060
I'll be glad of some words
with the Subedar.

155
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,740
Yes, Colonel?

156
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,900
I...

157
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,220
was wondering, Subedar,
if you have any sound intelligence

158
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,340
as to the bandits ranging hereabout.

159
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,540
I have a certain cargo in my charge.

160
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,740
And I'm anxious for its safety.

161
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,980
You mean to leave me here
in the company of common soldiers?

162
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,060
Good practice I'd have thought.

163
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,180
You're set to marry one, aren't you?

164
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,220
Major Joubert is a gentleman.

165
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,100
Yeah? Then, God help him.

166
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,940
The Company officer
has given me his word

167
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,300
provision will be made
till you're safely to Kalimgong.

168
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,580
You gave your word to Viscount
Sedgefield.

169
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,780
If there are bandits in these hills,

170
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,780
then this column affords you far
better safety than us.

171
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,660
The colonel is right, ma'am.

172
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm glad of it.

173
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,460
At least I shall no longer be kept
awake by your snoring.

174
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,860
I don't snore.
Like a carthorse.

175
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,300
And since you are set upon your fait
accompli,

176
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,340
there is nothing further to say.

177
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,260
Monsieur.

178
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,980
She took it rather well, I thought.

179
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,740
Colonel Sharpe?

180
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,900
Mrs Tredinnick.

181
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,180
My husband is the major of the
engineers.

182
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,140
I'm certain he'd wish me to present
his compliments

183
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,780
and an invitation to dine with us
this evening.

184
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,820
That's really kind of you, ma'am,
but...

185
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,900
We'd be delighted.

186
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Mr Harper, ma'am.

187
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,860
Well, until this evening, then.

188
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,060
I was gonna say no.

189
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,860
Are you all right?
Listen, you need to see a surgeon.

190
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,940
I'll do no such thing.

191
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
I'll speak to Pillai.

192
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,140
Oh, a Company surgeon?

193
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,620
I'd rather let you loose
with a hammer and fleam.

194
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,140
I'll be all right, Richard.
Truly I will.

195
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,180
OK.

196
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,300
I'll fetch us kit.

197
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,100
We're bedding down here.
Yeah.

198
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,620
Who's them strangers walking
Bo Peep, then, Colour?

199
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,020
No business of yours, Quilter.
See the prisoner is fed and watered.

200
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,060
He won't have none.
Nevertheless it must be offered.

201
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,340
King's Regulations are very clear on
this point. So look alive.

202
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,340
Run your vittels.

203
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,380
Do you want 'em or don't you?

204
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,780
Tis a matter of indifference to me.

205
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
But I must fetch 'em here

206
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,860
and here as I am bid, no matter.

207
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,340
Corp,

208
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,820
it isn't worth taking on.

209
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,140
When we get back to the lines,
Colour will speak on your part.

210
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,300
That being done,

211
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,620
seems to me you'll either hang or
you won't. And there's an end on it.

212
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,540
What a comfort you are.

213
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,340
What's your name, then, Corporal?

214
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Barabbas.

215
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,460
Bloody hell. I thought Dick were bad.

216
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,540
Barabbas?

217
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,660
A Bible name, in't it?

218
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,060
I had it off a priest at the
Scottish Mission.

219
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,020
Oh, aye, foundling.

220
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,020
No shame in that.

221
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,620
Half the world were got without
ceremony.

222
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,620
Not always the worst half either.

223
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,900
Deserve it, did he,
the officer you killed?

224
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,580
I've known many that have.

225
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,780
But robbery, mind...

226
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,700
regimental stores.

227
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,900
I'd sooner an honest murderer
than a man as thieves off his mates.

228
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,420
But I expect you'll tell me you're
neither.

229
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,420
I've never met a guilty man.

230
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,820
Colonel Sharpe.

231
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,980
Mr Harper.

232
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,180
You honour our table.
Thank you, Major.

233
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,060
Now, if I may, Reverend Watkin.

234
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,100
Ensign Beauclere you know.

235
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,380
My wife, of course. Miss Bonnet...

236
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,420
And I are already acquainted.

237
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,460
Oh, of course.

238
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,620
Well, we wait only upon...

239
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,900
Ah, there he is.
Good evening, Subedar.

240
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,140
My apologies, I was detained...
Argh!

241
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,180
SHOUTING

242
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,060
Take cover!

243
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,340
King's men to me! 69th to me!

244
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,260
Colour Wormwood, defend the camp!

245
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,580
Chitu's men?

246
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,620
Like as not.

247
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,420
What's the bill, Mr Beauclere?

248
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,140
Her Highness and the commonality
are all accounted for, sir.

249
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,860
Of Company troops, four are numbered
dead, including the surgeon.

250
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,020
Six are wounded,

251
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,220
of which two, including Subedar
Pillai, are like to die.

252
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,940
And your own section?
Not a man come to harm, sir.

253
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,460
Colour Wormwood confides they gave
good account of themselves.

254
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
Though I confess,

255
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,460
with all that befell...

256
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,780
I'm hard pressed to order events.

257
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
The fire and the fighting.

258
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,980
The horses an' all.

259
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
Your first action?

260
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,100
Yes, sir.

261
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
You did well.

262
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,980
I would hope so, sir.

263
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,340
I was, you see, born to a soldier.

264
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,500
Indeed?

265
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,900
Perhaps you met him. You will have
heard of him almost certainly.

266
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,580
He was the man brevetted major
at Vittoria

267
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,660
for capturing Marshal Jourdan's
baton.

268
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,060
I don't believe I know him.

269
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,060
You would have taken to him, sir.

270
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,260
For he was very brave.

271
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Much admired by his men.

272
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,180
"Was", Mr Beauclere?

273
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,740
He fell, sir,

274
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,780
at Roncesvalles.

275
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,780
When I was a boy.

276
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,980
And there was I thinking
it was you and me

277
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,180
that came across the marshal's baton
at Vittoria,

278
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,260
abandoned in the baggage train along
with King Joe's royal Jakes pot.

279
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,620
'Appen your memory is off, Pat?

280
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,980
A common effect
of advancing years, I understand.

281
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,220
I posted pickets but...

282
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,780
..their throats were cut.

283
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,020
I should have done more.

284
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,900
You did all that could be expected.

285
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,380
I must beg of you a service,
Colonel.

286
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,340
Will you stay with the column?

287
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,700
At least as far as Kalimgong.

288
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,780
It's a lot to ask, I know, but...

289
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,700
it's only two days march.

290
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,220
Besides,

291
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,700
I should rest a lot easier,
knowing...

292
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,180
..a senior officer were among us.

293
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,380
You have Major Tredinnick.

294
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
An engineer, Colonel,

295
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,340
he is not a soldier.

296
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,460
Subedar Pillai is correct, Colonel.

297
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,580
Better by far, the men have someone
of both rank and martial reputation

298
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
to look to at such a time.

299
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,660
You may depend on my support.

300
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
In every particular.

301
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,740
I'm grateful. Gentlemen.

302
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,660
Colour Wormwood.

303
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Make ready the column to move out.

304
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,180
Mr Beauclere?

305
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,820
Whatever instruction you receive off
Colonel Sharpe,

306
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,940
you may take
as if the order were my own.

307
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,860
If you say so, sir.

308
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,900
Within the hour! Colour Wormwood.

309
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,940
What could I say?

310
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,980
Huh?

311
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,820
Do you hear me complaining?

312
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,140
Just so far as this hill station.

313
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,700
Two days,

314
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,580
then we're away.

315
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,740
So, who is he, then, Paddy?

316
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,900
Your Colonel Sharpe?

317
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,660
That would be "Mr Harper"
or "Sergeant Major Harper",

318
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,780
when addressing me, Private Croop.

319
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,940
Who is he, though? He put Colour
Wormwood in a brown study.

320
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,620
You'd know, Dan, you'd know.

321
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,180
For of all studies, I swear, there's
none as brown as yours.

322
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,100
He's no proper officer,
that much is plain.

323
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,740
He's more of an officer than you'll
ever meet, Croop.

324
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,900
He don't talk like no officer.

325
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,740
He may not have
the holiday and lady terms

326
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,780
that some of your peacocks so easily
command,

327
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,060
but when your back
is against the wall,

328
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,860
he's the one man you want beside
you.

329
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,780
How is the Subedar?

330
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,740
Very weak, ma'am.

331
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,660
He has lost much blood.

332
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,220
Though he suffers me to touch him,
he will take of me no water.

333
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,540
Even this I am only able to do
when he sleeps.

334
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,180
Dustoor hai. It's the custom,
a stricture of his birth.

335
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,380
But if he does not let me help him,
he will die.

336
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,140
Perhaps, but...

337
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,620
Subedar Pillai would sooner death

338
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,540
than to break his caste.

339
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,980
Colour Wormwood.

340
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,820
Volunteers for a forage party.
Your section will serve.

341
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,660
Begging your pardon, sir,
but that's coolie work.

342
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,780
Can't have King's men cutting corn,

343
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,500
not while Company troops are sat on
their arses.

344
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,060
Company troops are needed here,
Colour.

345
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,220
To protect the column.

346
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,380
And if the bandits should return,
sir?

347
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,340
Company troops made a pretty poor
show of it last evening.

348
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,700
And Mr Beauclere is only a lad.

349
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,540
A mount of pluck is worth a ton of
shit and that lad has got pluck.

350
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,940
So would you
with a name to live up to.

351
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,180
'Appen his father
were a brevet major.

352
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,420
Captured Marshal Jourdan's
baton at Vittoria.

353
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,620
Begging your pardon, again, sir,

354
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,140
but I wouldn't put much money
into that tale.

355
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,660
There's only one Beauclere I know of
at Vittoria.

356
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,780
And he was no brevet major.

357
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,380
Bewrayed his breeches at the first
volley and turned tail.

358
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Provosts found him after the battle,

359
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,020
at an inn, drunk as a judge
and in such a condition,

360
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,060
put a rope to his neck.

361
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,980
You are mistaken, Colour Wormwood.

362
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,500
There was another Captain Beauclere
upon the field that day.

363
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,580
Indeed, sir.

364
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,740
And was there?

365
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,460
I do not know the particulars of
this other fellow,

366
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,580
but I assure you

367
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,020
it was my father who captured
Jourdan's baton.

368
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,420
Aye.

369
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,100
Stay with the column, then,
if that is your will.

370
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,020
Thank you, sir.

371
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,540
Something you wanted of us,
Mr Beauclere?

372
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
It's Miss Bonnet, sir.

373
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,740
She's taken a horse.

374
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,860
I tried to stop her, sir, but...

375
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,580
she said she would only be some
short while.

376
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,900
What the hell
do you think you're about?

377
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,060
I wanted to ride.

378
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,340
I can see that. Perhaps you've
forgot.

379
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,580
But only last night we were attacked
by Chitu's bandits.

380
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,780
They will be far behind us by now.

381
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,460
I wouldn't be so sure.
If I can track you, so can they.

382
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,140
I will return presently.

383
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,180
Now, Madam!

384
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,060
At once!

385
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
God knows I didn't look for this
duty.

386
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
But for better or worse,

387
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,900
I'm responsible for your safety.

388
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Unhand me.

389
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,980
You are rude, sir.

390
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,060
You are rude and ignorant

391
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,140
and an uncouth brute!

392
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,700
And you, madam, are a spoiled,
wilful,

393
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,180
petulant and selfish young fool.

394
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,940
Selfish?

395
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,700
If you will not take thoughts of your
own well-being,

396
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,420
then at least consider
your fellow travellers.

397
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,780
I'm seeing the column safe to
Kalimgong.

398
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,380
We aren't chasing you
up and down the country.

399
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,500
Now, get on your mount
and follow me back!

400
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,740
Or will you have me carry you?

401
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,620
You would not dare.

402
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,020
I was done with my ride anyway.

403
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,740
Do your duty now, boy.

404
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,780
You flow like the River Liffey.

405
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,700
Argh.

406
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,420
Sir. Major sahib.

407
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,140
GUNSHOT

408
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,060
SHOUTING

409
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,820
We're being attacked,
Your Highness.

410
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,610
SHOUTING

411
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,690
Can you fight?

412
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,610
SCREAMING

413
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,610
Stay here and keep out of sight.
I'll do no such thing.

414
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,130
For once in your life, do as you're
damn well told!

415
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,890
Fall back! Fall back!

416
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,810
King's men and Company to me!

417
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,370
I told you to stay put!

418
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,850
I could use a rifle.
Not a bloody chance.

419
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,890
We need every man we can get.

420
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,770
TRUMPET

421
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,730
Count Dragomirov.
Colonel Sharpe.

422
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,930
By God,

423
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,930
I were never so glad to see a
cavalryman.

424
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,730
May I impose then upon your
hospitality for some short while?

425
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,690
At least until our mounts are
rested,

426
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,730
and we may continue the pursuit?

427
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,610
Aye. And welcome.

428
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,530
Colour Wormwood will see you
provisioned.

429
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,570
I must take count of our losses.

430
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,290
Colour Wormwood!
Sir.

431
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,010
I want that prisoner secured now.

432
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,010
This instant.

433
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,930
You heard him. Take him away.

434
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,090
Oh, I see the hand of God is upon
you still...

435
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,010
Corporal Hakeswill.

436
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,850
What did you call him?

437
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,930
Corporal Hakeswill.

438
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,850
The luckiest soldier I ever met.

439
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,850
Hakeswill?

440
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,690
God all bloody mighty.

441
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,690
Take it easy, please!

442
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,650
Please!

443
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,810
Hakeswill?

444
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,690
Enough now! Come on!

445
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,610
Hakeswill, where did you get your
name, then, eh?

446
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,650
HARPER: Stand off, Richard.

447
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,690
Barabbas?

448
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,690
A fine gesture is that.

449
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,770
Stand off, please!

450
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,770
Hakeswill! Hakeswill!

451
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,930
And you give him a rifle?

452
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,690
What's the matter, you bastard?
Cat got your tongue?

453
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,010
I'm talking to you.

454
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,610
Where did you get your name?
From a man like you.

455
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,610
Aye. Recoat was he?

456
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,210
Sergeant? I know he was.

457
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,250
Obadiah.

458
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,570
Ah! I thought as much.

459
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,890
Thief. Murderer. Rapist.

460
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,850
That were your father, Barabbas.

461
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,210
Well, I'll not leave it to a court
martial and the provosts.

462
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,730
I'll make an end of you here and now.
What's this man's father to you?

463
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,650
He killed my wife.

464
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,690
Killed her.

465
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,770
And left our daughter motherless.

466
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,450
Now be content.

467
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,410
For all that, sir,
this is not right.

468
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,490
Look to your business, Major.

469
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,650
If any man...

470
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,250
comes between me and that bastard,
I'll kill 'em.

471
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,170
Out of the way, Pat.
I can't let you do it.

472
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,210
Stand aside, damn you!

473
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,130
You'll have to put me down first.

474
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,410
I regret I cannot spare
any of my men to your escort.

475
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,770
But you may depend,
with my squadron in pursuit,

476
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,560
these devils will trouble you no
further.

477
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,880
So, from here,

478
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,800
where will you go?
Kalimgong.

479
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,840
The Company garrison.

480
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
You should be safe there.

481
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,440
You should step down from the wagon,
Miss Bonnet.

482
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,320
Take the air a while.

483
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
How is he?

484
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
He's failing.

485
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,280
I do not know how much longer he can
last without proper care.

486
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,480
I'm sure you're doing
all that can be done.

487
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,480
We shall make Kalimgong tomorrow.

488
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,480
The Subedar shall have a surgeon.

489
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,520
And you, your Major Joubert.

490
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,760
I am obliged to you for your action
during the attack.

491
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Obliged?

492
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,880
I am reluctant to be in your debt.

493
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,320
Having been the daughter of a
soldier,

494
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,600
I care little for the profession.

495
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,760
Then upon one thing at least, we are
in agreement.

496
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
As for any obligation,

497
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,120
I did my duty, ma'am.

498
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,040
Nothing more.

499
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,520
Have you not had enough excitement
for one day?

500
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,840
He's bad blood, Pat.

501
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,760
And that's an end on it.

502
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,880
God knows, Richard, I've never taken
another man's side against you

503
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,080
and I'm not gonna start now,
but you are wrong.

504
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
Am I though?
In this, yeah, you are.

505
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,280
Just keep him from my view.

506
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
One more day, Pat.

507
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,120
One more day and then I'm rid of 'em.

508
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,200
Miss Bonnet, Hakeswill,

509
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,120
the whole damn lot.

510
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,480
Whoa.

511
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,840
Why do we delay?
Is there difficulty?

512
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,200
Merely a precautionary measure,
ma'am.

513
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,920
Mr Harper and myself will reconnoitre
the way ahead. Reconnoitre?

514
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,480
But...this is a Company hill
station, is it not?

515
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,520
Aye, ma'am. And as such,
I would expect to see some men.

516
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
At least upon the battlements.

517
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,600
Major Tredinnick, you have command.

518
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,240
Yes, sir.
Wormwood, bring your section.

519
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,200
Skirmish order.

520
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,120
Skirmish order, lads.

521
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,480
Secure the fort.

522
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,520
You heard the colonel, gentlemen.
Look to it.

523
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,400
Safe bloody harbour is this.

524
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,560
That Chitu bastard
must have some strength

525
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
to take a fort fully garrisoned.

526
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
An escalade maybe.

527
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
Under cover of dark.

528
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,560
Could have been
over the walls and among them

529
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
before the alarm were raised.

530
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,520
Here, sir, we've got a live 'un.

531
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,600
Christ God almighty.

532
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Simmerson.

533
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,560
Do you know him, sir?

534
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,000
Aye, Croop.

535
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
GROANING

536
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,920
I know him.

537
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
HARPER: Deever.

538
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,980
Sir.

539
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,460
There's an infirmary
under the north rampart.

540
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,300
Take the wounded there.
Sir.

541
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
Water. Water.

542
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,740
I must have water.

543
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,660
Give him some.

544
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,380
Not too much now.

545
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,460
Just enough to wet his lips
or else he'll split his guts.

546
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,380
God bless you, sir, God bless you.

547
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,100
Praise God, sweet Jesus, for mercy.

548
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,140
Mercy.

549
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,180
Do you know, Simmerson?

550
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,460
Do you not know me?

551
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Aye, sir.

552
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,180
Thou art my redeemer, sir.

553
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,740
Dick Sharpe, Sir Henry.
Richard Sharpe.

554
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,700
The sweetest name in all the world,
sir.

555
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,660
Come press your cheek
against my lips, sir.

556
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,980
That I may kiss my blessed saviour.

557
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,980
The sun...

558
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,700
We must save the harvest.

559
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,020
He's raving.

560
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,340
It might be a kindness
to ease his suffering, sir.

561
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,340
I served once in a company
almost wiped out by his orders.

562
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,660
He's a stupid, malicious bastard.

563
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,780
Aye.

564
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,820
For he's my stupid, malicious
bastard.

565
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,900
If anybody has earned the right to do
for him, it's me.

566
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,140
And I say he lives.

567
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,460
Oh, no.

568
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,300
No, no, no, no, no. It won't do.

569
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,100
Am I to understand that gentlemen
and ladies are to billet together?

570
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,140
It is too much.

571
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,460
For shame, Mr Watkins, can not you
show some fellow feeling?

572
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,700
Miss Bonnet has suffered
a great shock.

573
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,620
What shock?

574
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,900
She's come here to meet her fiance.

575
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,860
And as to our quarters,

576
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,060
well, surely, between us
we can improve on our situation.

577
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,260
Why here even, a broom.

578
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,820
Might almost have been waiting upon
us for use.

579
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,060
Perhaps, Reverend, fetch me some
water

580
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,580
and see if there is some scrubbing
soap to be had.

581
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,580
Colour Wormwood.

582
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,660
The garrison must be put in the
earth.

583
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,020
Will you organise a burial party?

584
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,260
These hereabout lying dead is
Company troops, Mr Harper.

585
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,460
What of it?

586
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,780
You'll find the heathen
is most particular

587
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,060
about his funeral observances.

588
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,100
Is that a fact?

589
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,140
You see...

590
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,300
some is for burning,

591
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,020
some for setting adrift
along this holy river.

592
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,900
Whilst yet more has a fancy to have
their insides pecked out by birds.

593
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
It is a...

594
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,860
confusion.

595
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,060
Yet their wishes must be considered,
lest we...affront the living.

596
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,940
Just seem them in the ground,
will you, Wormwood?

597
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,260
And leave the rest to the Almighty,
hmm?

598
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,300
You heard him, lads.

599
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,180
Get on with it.

600
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,060
To soldier I signed up for,
I'm not a bloody grave digger.

601
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,020
It's my fancy we'll dig a church
yard full

602
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,580
before that long-legged jackanape is
done with us.

603
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,420
Just make sure it ain't our own
we're digging, Danny.

604
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,020
Oh, I means to, I means to.

605
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,740
The raiders have left us little of
use, Colonel.

606
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,940
No food.

607
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,220
And the well is spoiled
with the dead.

608
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,140
I had thought among the flotsam

609
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,620
to find some hint of the garrison's
fate.

610
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,700
A bandit attack.

611
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,980
I doubt the writer would have had
time to make note of such

612
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,980
before being himself overcome.

613
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,820
Yet someone has been here before me.

614
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,620
Unless these bandits are men of
learning,

615
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,780
I can't reason their interest
in books and parchment bonds.

616
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,700
Happen they've a taste for lists.

617
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,700
The army is fond of lists.

618
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,180
If you come upon any mention of Miss
Bonnet's fiance,

619
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,340
you'll let me know of it.

620
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,260
He's not among the dead? The only
white man accounted for is Simmerson.

621
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,260
It's possible this Major Joubert
is out on patrol.

622
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,420
I'll be glad to give her some hope.

623
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,700
My wife is offering such comfort and
assurance as she can.

624
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:58,140
Aye. You've a good 'un there, Major.
If you'll allow.

625
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,180
Indeed, Colonel.

626
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,180
I hold myself the luckiest of men.

627
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,300
Yet also, I fear, a selfish one.

628
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,340
There's a score of years and more
between us, sir.

629
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,220
I wonder sometimes if she would have
been happier with a younger man.

630
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,660
The choice was hers to make, Major.

631
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,740
To my mind, she chose wisely.

632
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,940
Aye, sir, aye.

633
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,100
As you say,

634
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,180
fortune favours me beyond my
deserving.

635
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,060
You'll catch 50 lashes if Colour
Wormwood finds you.

636
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,780
Now then.

637
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,700
Now then...

638
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,660
What have you?

639
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,380
As fine a pair
this soul ever laid eyes on.

640
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,540
Don't tell me there's some bevvy hid
there still.

641
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,660
God bless officers. Soldiers share!

642
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,540
Always!

643
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,220
But not here, eh?

644
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,900
Let's find ourselves a bit of peace
and quiet so we can enjoy it proper.

645
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,900
Should you be here, ma'am?

646
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,020
I can send someone to relieve you.

647
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,140
My time is better occupied.

648
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
How fares the general?

649
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,860
His thoughts come and go.

650
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,860
And the boy?

651
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,060
Sleeping.

652
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,260
If you embrace Christ with all your
heart,

653
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,420
even at this late hour,

654
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,380
all your sins will be washed as
white as snow. Come, sir.

655
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,980
I thought we'd cleared this place of
vultures.

656
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,140
You must leave the sick to their
rest, Mr Watkin.

657
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,860
As Madame tends to the physical,
Colonel,

658
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,860
so I look to tend the immortal soul.

659
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,940
As maybe, sir.

660
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,940
Yet you must come away.

661
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,860
Now, sir.

662
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,100
The man is dying.

663
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,620
Will you not let him go in peace?

664
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,580
I am on God's work, Colonel.
God's work!

665
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,700
You're a bloody hypocrite.
For shame, sir. For shame.

666
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,340
At least Simmerson
has cause for his madness.

667
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,260
You? You're the worst kind of
lunatic.

668
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,860
About your business, sir, and try
me no further.

669
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,060
Go, sir, sing,

670
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,540
cry hallelujah and give amen to the
top of your lungs, but not here.

671
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,340
WOMAN SINGING

672
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,580
Hey, hey, hey.

673
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,180
Ah!
Hello, missy.

674
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,220
How might a kiss be?

675
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,820
Hold her, Ned,
that I may have a kiss off her.

676
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,380
Leave her be.

677
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,940
All right?

678
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,180
A pretty pickle and no mistake.

679
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,340
600 miles between here and home.

680
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,180
I don't think we can rely

681
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,740
on Dragomirov's troopers to deliver
us again.

682
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,700
We've done what we said.

683
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,860
We brought them safely here.

684
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,860
We have.

685
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,820
Ain't our business to do owt else.

686
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,980
I won't argue with that.

687
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,020
Right.

688
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,940
Right.

689
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,100
We should just...

690
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,980
just leave them, then, eh?

691
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,020
We should.

692
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,100
But you won't.

693
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,340
Major.

694
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,620
Major, there's been some trouble,
sir.

695
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,940
Please, sir, come with me.

696
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,980
Just when it seemed
to be going so well.

697
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,860
Keep to all as I foretold, girl,
or the worst of it will come to you.

698
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,780
Savvy?

699
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,860
What the hell is going on here,
Colour?

700
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,340
My men come along your sapper there,
sir,

701
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,700
looking to take his pleasure of the
maid, he was, sir, by force.

702
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,420
Naturally, being concerned of her
honour,

703
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,420
they come to her defence.

704
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,340
You can ask the girl, sir.

705
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,660
Sir, I did not.

706
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,700
Their word against his, sir.

707
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,860
That's the very nub of it.

708
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,660
I can't believe a fine officer such
as yourself

709
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,980
would want to take sides with one of
them. Against your own.

710
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,940
Not only are you a liar, Wormwood,
but a bloody fool also.

711
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,020
Liar, sir?

712
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,540
That's a very serious charge, sir.

713
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,540
Very serious.

714
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,620
Not at all the sort of accusation

715
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,180
an officer would make against an
enlisted man

716
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,420
without such proofs as would be
necessary to back it up.

717
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,300
Proofs? Cases where the honour of an
enlisted man have been impugned,

718
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,820
sir, KRs are very clear about such
proofs, sir.

719
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,940
A barrack room lawyer, too, eh?

720
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,420
King's Regulations is like
the good book itself to such as I.

721
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,340
Then you'll know what the punishment
is

722
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,300
for running an indisciplined section.

723
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,260
Indisciplined?

724
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:55,340
These men are unfit for duty
through drink.

725
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,580
They are on drunk, sir, I grant,
but on duty, sir? No, sir.

726
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,380
There we differs.
Do we, Colour?

727
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,740
We does, sir.

728
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,900
I was raised up from the ranks,
Wormwood.

729
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,100
You know what that means?

730
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,100
It means you've done a feat, sir.
Usually.

731
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,340
It also means I know every dirty
soldier's trick in the book.

732
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,380
Is that so, sir?

733
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,420
It is so.

734
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,340
And I'll tell you something more.

735
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,500
Rape is a hanging offence.

736
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
Even attempted.

737
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,500
Rape's a hanging, drunk's a flogging.

738
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,580
And you in charge of all.

739
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,620
Sir.

740
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,660
I could break you for this.

741
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,580
Push you down to private.

742
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,380
I've seen some piss-poor sections in
my time, by God I have,

743
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,460
But yours is a bloody disgrace.

744
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,460
Work-shy, gutless,

745
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,540
but that is gonna change.

746
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,540
From now on, they are on picket.

747
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,660
Permanent.

748
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,540
And every spare second,
you're gonna be on drill.

749
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,820
Pat.
Sir.

750
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,660
I want them sober and on the
firestep within the hour.

751
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,780
Right, you sons of whores,

752
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,820
you heard the officer.

753
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,740
Double, double, double!

754
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,340
Aye, I know Robert.

755
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,820
Believe me.

756
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,860
If things were else, I'd hang 'em and
have done with it.

757
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,780
But we've 600 mile of hostile country
before us.

758
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,420
And I need every man I've got.

759
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,780
He will not be long now.

760
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,940
I'll stay by him.

761
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,780
There is no word of Philippe?

762
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,820
No, ma'am, not yet.

763
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,900
But that he was not found amongst the
rest...

764
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,780
..it's possible Major Joubert
survived.

765
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,780
Joubert...

766
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,860
Joubert!

767
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,100
The devil. The filthy devil.

768
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,140
Lie still, sir.

769
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,180
You are not yourself.

770
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,300
Joubert!

771
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,420
The harvest. We must save the
harvest.

772
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,420
Stop him!

773
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,340
Stop him...

774
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,380
He's not in his right mind, ma'am.
I promise.

775
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,940
He'll be calling for my head.
BEAUCLERE: Sir.

776
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,980
I think he's gone, sir.

777
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,980
Aye.

778
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,540
Aye, he's that.

779
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,940
Sharpe means to lead us on to
Calcutta.

780
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,940
Says who?

781
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,020
Colour had it off his own lips.

782
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,020
Then we're dead men.

783
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,940
Someone should do something.

784
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,300
What though, boys?

785
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,220
There's the rub.

786
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,460
And who to do it?

787
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,380
Any volunteers?

788
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,740
A soldier's solution, then.

789
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,220
We shall be like unto the Roman,

790
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,780
when the parted his raiment into
four,

791
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,100
yet would not rend his vesture,

792
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,020
but rather cast lots for it.

793
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,420
He that plucks the shortest measure
from Deever's shut fist...

794
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,860
shall stand assassin.

795
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,340
That's murder, Colour.

796
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,700
It's him or us, boys.

797
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,140
Him or us.

798
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,940
Pat.

799
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,300
Jesus.

800
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,340
Keep 'em back, Pat.

801
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,260
Tell 'em to keep back.

802
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,460
FLIES BUZZING

803
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,700
How many?

804
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,100
Too many. 60, 70.

805
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,100
Whole families, Richard.

806
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,300
Young and old.

807
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,580
Men, women, children,
for the love of God.

808
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,420
This Chitu is as wicked a dog
as I've ever known.

809
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,540
Aye.

810
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,780
But it's a strange kind of rebel
that slaughters his own.

811
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,660
Do you not think?
These people were farmers, Pat.

812
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,660
No threat to any.
Where's the profit in it?

813
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,380
You've set your finger on the nub of
the matter, Colonel.

814
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,780
There's more to this than simple
rebellion.

815
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,300
I'm told you had some time this
afternoon

816
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,980
in conversation with Major
Tredinnick, General.

817
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,140
Whom?

818
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,740
We spoke of the attack upon
Kalimgong, General.

819
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,860
You remember?

820
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,380
Of course I remember.
Damned hard to forget.

821
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,780
Perhaps you'll be so good as to tell
these gentlemen what befell.

822
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:52,660
Company half squadron arrived
to collect the early harvest.

823
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,900
And this would have been the 70
chests

824
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,220
mentioned in the Company writer's
report?

825
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,940
General?

826
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,820
It would, sir.

827
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,180
I gave the task
to my second-in-command.

828
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,260
First mistake.

829
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,860
Not my usual aide-de-camp.

830
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,300
But a damned Frenchman
on temporary attachment.

831
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,620
Papers in order.

832
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,820
But I thought it a rum go over
all the same.

833
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,820
Cavalryman, you see?

834
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,460
Never trust a damned Frenchman.

835
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,740
Go on, sir.

836
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,580
The devil had my sepoys
load his wagons.

837
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,420
Then once the job was done,

838
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,740
damn my eyes if the major didn't
mount up the cavalry

839
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,660
and turn them upon us.

840
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,340
Entire garrison slaughtered
to a man.

841
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,940
Only I was spared.

842
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Who was he?
I've told you.

843
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,220
Damn Frenchman.

844
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,500
Major Joubert,
the 3rd Native Cavalry.

845
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,460
But we agreed, sir, you were
confused upon the point.

846
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,660
Joubert is the fiance
to the young lady

847
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,100
who has been tending you in your
infirmity.

848
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,580
I think I might remember the name of
the devil

849
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,540
who staked me out under the sun to
die, sir.

850
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,780
Joubert.

851
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,660
Major Philippe Joubert.

852
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,180
Ma'am.
Non.

853
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,700
Philippe is dead. The general is
mistaken. You said yourself.

854
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,780
Perhaps.

855
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,300
Yet we did not find him.

856
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,380
It's not possible.

857
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,380
You think I would marry such a man?

858
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,380
What the hell was in those chests
that was so important anyway?

859
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,350
Opium, Pat.

860
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:10,190
Grown under licence from the Company
and destined for China.

861
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,510
Same as they were raising
in this village.

862
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,750
Colonel Sharpe is right, gentlemen.

863
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,550
The Company has these last years
imported from China

864
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,630
ever greater quantities of tea.

865
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,550
Tea must be bought with something.

866
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,870
It helped them to balance the books.

867
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,230
By selling China the one thing she
craves.

868
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,870
You have not one whit of proof to
support so scandalous an allegation.

869
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,030
I expect he does.

870
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:37,110
I had occasion myself to examine the
writer's office.

871
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:40,630
There are some certain ledgers
and accounting books missing.

872
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,910
The contents of which I intend
upon my return to England,

873
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,110
and to the everlasting shame of His
Majesty's government,

874
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,270
to make known.

875
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,430
It would seem this Joubert, then,
sir,

876
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,870
has resolved to enter into the trade
himself.

877
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,030
Not just him, Mr Beauclere.

878
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,910
The half squadron of cavalry that
came to Kalimgong

879
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,990
was of the 3rd Native Horse.

880
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:02,910
It's Dragomirov.

881
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,030
Stealing the harvest.

882
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:07,990
And blame it on this rebel Chitu.

883
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,390
If such a man even exists.

884
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,750
There's something out there, sir.

885
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:27,790
Moving.

886
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,830
In those trees and bushes.

887
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,750
Skirmish order.

888
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,670
Halt! Who goes there?

889
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,470
Sharpe.

890
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,430
Advance and be recognised.

891
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,390
What was it? A tiger? What?

892
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,430
Yeah, a tiger, all right.

893
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,350
But only a littl'un.

894
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,830
The lass say owt?

895
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,950
Men on horses, sir.

896
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,510
Bandits?
Or "bad men" she says.

897
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:22,830
And one of them, their "chief" she
called him, was white.

898
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,830
Why did Dragomirov let us carry on
to the hill station?

899
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:33,110
Happen he'd no notion then.

900
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:35,790
The fort had already fallen.
To Joubert.

901
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,910
Nor reason to care over much.

902
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,950
For we should have taken such
slaughter

903
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,870
to be the work of Chitu and his
bandits.

904
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,310
More, sir, we should have returned
to the lines

905
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,830
bearing tales which served to
further his deception.

906
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,710
Only, Joubert made a mistake.

907
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,270
He left alive a witness to his
treachery.

908
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,230
If in ignorance, then, we presented
no threat,

909
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,750
we must assume that when Dragomirov
is reunited with Joubert,

910
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,550
the truth will out.
Aye.

911
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,030
We leave at first light.

912
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,950
HORSES WALKING

913
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,510
DRAGOMIROV:
They have been and gone.

914
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,350
I hope, Major Joubert, that your
taste for the dramatic flourish

915
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,510
is not about to cost us dear.

916
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,630
Monsieur.

917
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,750
If Simmerson died

918
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,830
before Sharpe's column got here,
all is well.

919
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:41,270
If he survived, however, to tell of
your perfidy...

920
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,870
The bridge is gone.

921
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,990
I'd say the rains have washed it
away.

922
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:17,830
Colour Wormwood, take picket.
Sing out if any bugger comes.

923
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:19,870
Sir.
Pat.

924
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,390
Unhitch the wagons,
turn the animals loose.

925
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:26,030
I understand Mr Nash is upon
fashioning a pavilion

926
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:29,110
very like your own for the Prince
Regent, Your Highness.

927
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:31,030
In Brighton.

928
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,990
Brighton?
A small town by the sea. In Sussex.

929
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:38,310
When complete, I fancy it will be
the gayest place under heaven.

930
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,150
Your Highness,
I must ask you to dismount.

931
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,710
Dismount? Why?

932
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,430
We bear enough provision for
ourselves, ma'am.

933
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,910
The animals must be turned loose here
and left to themselves.

934
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,110
I will not abandon my Chetak.

935
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,830
We've no choice, ma'am.
From here we go on foot.

936
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,030
Only those things essential to our
journey may be carried.

937
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,950
Food, water, ammunition.

938
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,710
Keep that rope nice and tight now,
Singh.

939
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,630
Nice and tight.

940
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:22,830
Only those things essential
to our journey, Mr Watkin.

941
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,710
Maybe you did not hear.

942
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:27,390
But these things are essential,
Colonel Sharpe.

943
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,470
Indeed?

944
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,110
This is essential?
And that, and these?

945
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,150
They are liturgical accoutrements,
sir.

946
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:37,870
Necessary to furnish
my new mission at Banutola.

947
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:40,070
Once we've reached safe ground,

948
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,990
you can make arrangements to have
your equipment retrieved.

949
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,870
But, Colonel...

950
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,630
THEY SPEAK IN A NATIVE TONGUE

951
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,510
Where is she going?

952
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,470
It's my looking glass.

953
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,470
With Colonel Sharpe's haste

954
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:14,270
to have us abandon all our
belongings, she forgot it.

955
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,750
We've no time for this, ma'am.
I know.

956
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,990
I told her so, Mr Harper, I told
her, but...

957
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,070
she insists.

958
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,230
I looked for you at Kalimgong,
Colonel.

959
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:39,070
But I only found fresh graves and
the garrison missing.

960
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,190
The fort was attacked

961
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,870
and a company entire put to the
sword.

962
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,670
Did none survive?
None.

963
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:49,470
MARIE-ANGELIQUE: Philippe.

964
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,470
Non.

965
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,390
(WHISPERS)

966
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:00,230
But I think one perhaps.

967
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:04,270
And by your lie, I must assume
he has told you of his misfortune.

968
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,630
Leaving the commanding officer alive

969
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:10,670
was an unnecessary cruelty
on my associate's behalf.

970
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,790
Major Joubert.

971
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:16,310
I cannot allow your companions to
reach the lines

972
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:19,190
in receipt of such intelligence
against me.

973
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:23,150
Are you gonna kill 'em? In any
enterprise there is always spoilage.

974
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:27,150
But as gentlemen, can we not come to
some reasonable agreement?

975
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,310
You and I?

976
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:32,390
There is no need for you to suffer
along with the rest.

977
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,910
Nor indeed the good major's fianced
bride.

978
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:38,550
THEY SPEAK FRENCH

979
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,350
If it is a matter of scruple,
I have always found gold

980
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:44,310
the sovereign thing on earth for a
troubled conscience.

981
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,510
There's not enough gold in the world
to buy your life back.

982
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,630
My life?

983
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,830
Well, we shall have our time.
Perhaps sooner than you think.

984
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,350
Quick.

985
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,270
Quick, get him across.

986
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,750
Colonel, sahib.
Come on, lass.

987
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,670
GUNSHOT

988
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,310
Major! Get up, sir.

989
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,270
Get up.

990
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,390
I want them alive!

991
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,550
Come on, Richard. Up you come.

992
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:56,470
Come on.

993
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,390
Richard!

994
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,190
Where the hell are you going?

995
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,310
Can't leave her to 'em, Pat.

996
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,710
You go across that river,
you're a dead man.

997
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,750
What good are you to her then?

998
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,670
Damn it to hell!

999
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,470
Stand by, you bastard!

1000
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,110
Colonel Sharpe.

1001
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:57,390
Come on, lass. It's time
we were gone from this place.

1002
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,950
Fire!

1003
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:05,510
I wish you an uncomfortable night.
