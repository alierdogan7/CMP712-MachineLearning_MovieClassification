1
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,480
Admiral Yamamoto, please.

2
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,484
He asked not to be disturbed.
- lt is most urgent.

3
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,884
Admiral Yamamoto?

4
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,564
Tokyo has been bombed.
- When?

5
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,803
10 minutes ago. Yokohama, Kawasaki
and Yokosuka were also bombed.

6
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,959
His lmperial Majesty is unharmed.
l personally phoned the palace.

7
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:24,799
Damage? - Very little to Tokyo.
No reports from the other cities,

8
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,884
but it seems probable
that they too were barely scratched.

9
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,727
How did they do it, Watanabe?

10
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,804
They launched long-range
B-25 bombers from their carriers.

11
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,918
They came in at treetop level,
and were first seen over the city.

12
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,126
Tokyo ... bombed!

13
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:46,317
Sir, l understand your concern
for the Emperor's safety, but ...

14
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:51,280
You may speak freely, Commander.
- This raid is a blessing in disguise.

15
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,726
The Americans have
proven you correct.

16
00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,647
Dur homeland is not invulnerable.
After today, the General Staff

17
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,206
will certainly approve
your operation M-l.

18
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:14,563
Lieutenant-Colonel Doolittle
led the raid with a force of 16 B-25s

19
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,005
and an all-volunteer crew of airmen.

20
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:21,004
Most of the planes carried
500-pound demolition bombs

21
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,286
and single incendiary clusters,

22
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:28,922
which were dropped on oil stores,
factories and military sites in Tokyo.

23
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,527
A few planes made minor strikes
on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya,

24
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:37,524
with one bomb hitting
the Japanese carrier Ryuko.

25
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:42,605
News of this raid has improved
American and allied morale,

26
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,843
while at the same time constituting
a blow to Japanese prestige.

27
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:57,401
Thanks, Sir.

28
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:05,246
At his press conference today,
President Roosevelt was asked:

29
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:11,758
''Can you tell us, where did
those planes start from and go to?''

30
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,127
He replied:
''Yes, the time has come to tell you.

31
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:19,238
They came from our new
secret base at Shangri-la ...''

32
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,485
Well, my God, it's Captain Garth!

33
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,167
l was expecting some junior officer.
This is an unexpected honor!

34
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:28,968
Yeah, like hell it is, Joe!

35
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:33,920
Admiral Nimitz sent me over to ...
- To chew my ass off, huh?

36
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,881
Dfficially, l'm supposed to question
your estimate of Japanese intentions.

37
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:44,044
Why so grim, Matt? Doolittle's attack
should've thrilled you CinCPAC people.

38
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:47,841
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.

39
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:52,686
We only got 4 carriers
in the Pacific. We need to rebuild.

40
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,287
Now the boss is afraid Yamamoto's
going to jump back at us. But where?

41
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,719
We got the latest intercepts here.

42
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,163
Here's a list of Japanese ships

43
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:13,519
we suspect will be assigned
to amphib operations south of Rabaul.

44
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:18,559
The Coral Sea! That's where
we think they'll strike next.

45
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:22,800
But something else is stirring,
something out our way.

46
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,086
We need facts, not guesswork.

47
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:30,279
Matt, we cracked Yamamoto's code,
but we can't just reel it off.

48
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:33,886
We get a flicker here
and a glimmer there.

49
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,883
How much can you decipher?
- Hell, 15, maybe ...

50
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,008
Really decipher.
- Ten percent.

51
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,358
10 per ... That's one word in 10.
For Christ's sake, you're guessing!

52
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,845
We like to call it ''analysis''.

53
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,845
Alright. What are these indications
that something's brewing out our way?

54
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:59,321
There's no hard clues yet.
- What do you have, Joe?

55
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,881
lncreased radio traffic between
Yamamoto's commanders. - That's all?

56
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,079
Could be significant. At least
l feel that something's stirring.

57
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,604
Alright,

58
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,918
l'll take that list of Jap ships
you ''feel'' are headed for Coral Sea.

59
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:20,198
Nimitz may send Fletcher's task force
to see what's going on.

60
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:24,124
We'll see how your 10-percent
guesswork pays off, huh?

61
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,204
As a back-room code-cracker
l thank you, Matt.

62
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:32,887
Joe, could l ask you
something very personal? - Certainly.

63
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:38,645
lt really stinks down here.
How often do your people take a bath?

64
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,564
Bath? God, l don't know ...
What day is it?

65
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,047
Forget it, Joe.

66
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,564
Any new Yamamoto intercepts?

67
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:57,679
Here's a first mention of ''A-F'',
whatever that means.

68
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,886
A-F?

69
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:28,364
Captain!

70
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:32,639
Tom!

71
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,243
Dad ...

72
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:40,161
My God, Tom.
When did you get in? l didn't know ...

73
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:46,439
Last night. - This is beautiful. Why
didn't you write that you were coming?

74
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:52,849
l've been assigned to Kaneohe.
- Well, l'll finally see some of you.

75
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,483
Three years!

76
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:59,606
You look great, Tom.
- So do you, Dad.

77
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,398
Kaneohe, are you? What squadron?
- VF-8.

78
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:14,969
You'll like it. Your C.D. used to be
my wing-man on the old Langley.

79
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,002
Could we talk somewhere?

80
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,844
Sure ... Here.

81
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,320
l phoned you from Guam
the day you graduated.

82
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:36,439
Yeah, l heard later.
l'm sorry l missed the call.

83
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,568
l guess your mother was there?

84
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:42,244
Yeah.
- How is she?

85
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:47,878
Recovered from the divorce, l guess.
- That's good.

86
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,520
l was hoping maybe we could ...
- Dad,

87
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:03,081
l've fallen in love with
a Japanese girl. l want to marry her.

88
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,399
l need your help.

89
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,560
l damn well guess you do, Tiger.

90
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,127
She's been arrested in Honolulu.

91
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,682
How did you manage that?

92
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,321
ln San Diego and getting mixed up
with a Japanese girl in Honolulu?

93
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:29,519
She was a student in San Diego.
- And she was arrested here?

94
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:34,525
Her parents live here. She wouldn't
marry me without their permission.

95
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,923
Apparently, the FBl has something
on her folks, so they got picked up.

96
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:41,557
Well, that figures.

97
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:45,565
Haruko was born here.
She's as loyal as you or me.

98
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:51,601
Anyway, the minute l got in l went
to see where they're being held.

99
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,808
She wouldn't see me.
- Why not?

100
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,961
l don't know.

101
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:04,158
She and her parents will be sent
back to the mainland in a few days.

102
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,799
lt sticks in your throat
that l want to marry a Japanese girl?

103
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:15,361
Sticks in your ...? Don't give me
that ''racial bigot'' crap.

104
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,198
l don't care what color she is.
- lt's not the point ...

105
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,759
Christ almighty!

106
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:25,003
6 months after Pearl Harbor!
Boy, you have lousy timing.

107
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,603
What's her name?
l'll see if l can get her FBl report.

108
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:37,762
l wrote it down for you:
Haruko Sakura.

109
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,122
But promise one thing:

110
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,807
Don't do anything stupid
till l see what l can get hold of.

111
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,722
That's a deal.

112
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:25,358
ln my opinion, the plan is not only
unnecessary, but doomed to fail.

113
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:30,797
Admiral Kondo, Dperation M-l
was conceived by our best strategist.

114
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:36,761
We are aware of Captain Kuroshima's
authorship and his reputation.

115
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:41,162
But this time, the god of operations
has conceived a monster.

116
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:44,682
Would you please explain?

117
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,445
How am l expected to land
my invasion forces on Midway,

118
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,842
unless the enemy airfields and
shore batteries have been neutralized?

119
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:58,407
Admiral Nagumo has said his carriers
will obliterate the American defenses.

120
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,360
The enemy's land-based bombers
have a range of 400 miles more

121
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,487
than Nagumo's carrier planes.

122
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:09,848
His ships would be blown out of
the sea before he launches his attack.

123
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:15,687
l destroyed the US fleet at Hawaii,
where the risk was far greater.

124
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,478
Where were the land-based bombers?

125
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:24,327
A surprise attack with
a carrier task force is one thing.

126
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,960
But this, a strike
against Midway and the Aleutians

127
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,600
with 200 ships and 100,000 men.

128
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:40,847
Does the idea of taking the Aleutians
cause you concern, Hosogaya?

129
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:48,844
No, Sir. But an operation so complex,
l'd like more time to study it.

130
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:53,288
After all, in a matter of hours
our Coral Sea operation begins.

131
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:56,118
We have sufficient forces for both.

132
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,124
l tend to agree
with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya.

133
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,288
l suggest we meet again
after the Coral Sea campaign.

134
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:11,119
Very well.
- Gentlemen, consider this:

135
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,282
The Americans are still
unprepared and outnumbered.

136
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:19,558
lf their fleet can be lured
into battle and defeated,

137
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,519
they will have no significant
naval force left in the Pacific.

138
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,965
They will have to sue for peace.

139
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:30,604
l have traveled widely in America,
my friends.

140
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:34,479
Their industrial might is awesome.

141
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:41,044
l'm convinced our only hope of victory
is one massive strike at Midway.

142
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,683
Joe, are you sure this
''hot information'' of yours can't wait?

143
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,321
l already got one thing for the boss.
- l consider this urgent.

144
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,085
And, you were right about Coral Sea.
That's where the Japs were, alright.

145
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:26,799
Every ship on your list was there.
- Did we get hurt?

146
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,165
We got hurt.

147
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,884
Welcome on, Admiral.
How was your flight?

148
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,325
Long and full of potholes.

149
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:45,517
Got Fletcher's Coral Sea report?
- Right here, Sir.

150
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:57,040
Get in back, Joe.
But wait till l cue you in.

151
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,440
Here's Admiral Fletcher's
preliminary report, Sir.

152
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,999
We lost the Lexington.

153
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:10,158
What about the enemy?

154
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,685
We sank one light carrier, one big
first-line job and some small ships.

155
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,126
Looks like
we just about broke even, Admiral.

156
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,683
We can't trade the Japanese
carrier for carrier, Matt.

157
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,559
We started with a 3 to 1 superiority.

158
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,847
With the Lexington gone,
the Saratoga laid up,

159
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:36,004
all we've got is the Hornet,
the Enterprise and the Yorktown.

160
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:42,279
Sir, Yorktown was heavily damaged
at Coral Sea. There's the report.

161
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,722
Admiral, Commander Rochefort
has something urgent, he says.

162
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:52,201
lt's about objective A-F,
the meaning of ''A-F''.

163
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:57,922
Dur listening posts pick up traffic
between Yamamoto's flag commanders.

164
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:03,768
There's been a heavy traffic volume,
with references to object ''A-F'' ...

165
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,128
... and A-D. A-D is a mystery,
maybe a diversion.

166
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:12,727
But l think we've identified ''A-F''.
lt's Midway.

167
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:18,522
lt had us stymied until one of my men
remembered an intercept from March.

168
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,968
A Jap reconnaissance pilot radioed
his base that he's close to ''A-F''.

169
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,406
We plotted every course
the plane could have have taken,

170
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,404
and the only appreciable landmass
he could have flown over was Midway.

171
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,121
Joe! - l know it's thin.
- Thin? Damn near invisible!

172
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:38,965
But l figured out
a way to confirm it, Sir.

173
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:44,045
lf you have this flown to Midway.
lt's a fake message, Admiral,

174
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:48,442
reporting that Midway's
freshwater condenser's broken down.

175
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:55,448
lt should be transmitted in the clear,
so the Japanese get every word.

176
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,606
lnstruct Midway to include this in
their housekeeping traffic tomorrow.

177
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,681
Aye-aye, Sir.

178
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,803
Send this right away.

179
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,403
Hey, chief!

180
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,083
What's this?

181
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:37,084
There ain't nothin' wrong
with our freshwater condenser!

182
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,287
Dombrowski, send it.

183
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:47,005
Damn heat's gettin' to everybody here.

184
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:08,408
Have this intercept coded
and transmitted to fleet headquarters!

185
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:40,478
They took the bait, Admiral.
Rochefort just decoded a transmission

186
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,926
from Kwajalein
to Yamamoto's headquarters:

187
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:47,999
''A-F has trouble
with its freshwater condenser.''

188
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:49,842
''A-F'' has to be Midway lsland.

189
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,639
Be at my office at 05:00, Matt.
l'm calling in the whole staff.

190
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,201
This is how
l expect the battle to develop:

191
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:07,160
The northern force, under Hosogaya,
strikes the Aleutians as a diversion.

192
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:11,847
To keep Nimitz's attention
away from our main objective.

193
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:15,002
He will not realize
our objective is Midway

194
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,322
until 24 hours later, when
Nagumo's carriers strike the island

195
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,004
and destroy the American
planes and shore batteries.

196
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:26,766
At that hour you move in,
Kondo, with your invasion forces.

197
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,287
Nimitz will be forced to respond.
He'll commit the balance of his fleet,

198
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,805
most certainly his carriers,
to repel the invasion.

199
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,838
His carrier commander
will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey.

200
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,880
l have studied his tactics
and l have studied the man.

201
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,406
Halsey is courageous,
tough-minded and not afraid of risks,

202
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:50,084
but we will turn
these strengths against him.

203
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:54,118
lt will take Halsey's task force
at least 48 hours to reach Midway.

204
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:58,482
By that time, Nagumo, you'll have
crushed Midway and be waiting for him.

205
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,958
You'll have a better position,

206
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:06,044
and at least
a 2-to-1 superiority in carriers,

207
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:10,328
and 4 to 5 times
the number of screening vessels.

208
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:16,326
Assuming the American fleet is still
guarding Hawaii when we strike.

209
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,004
Nimitz is crippled
and on the defensive.

210
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:23,197
He must deploy his remaining strength
around his most valuable Pacific base.

211
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,565
l agree with Admiral Nagumo.

212
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,722
We must make certain
where the enemy fleet is.

213
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:35,364
l propose we send 2 flying boats
to French Frigate Shoals on the 29th.

214
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:41,200
We fuel them by tanker submarine and
fly them to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.

215
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:45,363
They then report whether or not
the American fleet is actually there.

216
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:48,124
A very wise precaution indeed.

217
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:53,045
We will call it ''Dperation K''.
Does anyone have any other thoughts?

218
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:54,848
Yes.

219
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:58,799
We can achieve a great victory,

220
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:03,282
providing Nimitz and Halsey
do exactly what you expect.

221
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:10,206
The Enterprise and the Hornet
are due in by sundown.

222
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:13,328
The rest of the task force
should be in by morning.

223
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,966
The Yorktown is more
severely damaged than we thought.

224
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,325
How soon can we dry-dock her?

225
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:24,359
By the 17th, if a Jap sub
doesn't spot the oil she's trailing.

226
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,364
Admiral Fletcher
just radioed in with a repair list.

227
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:35,000
Tell the yard repairman l want
every workman he can get to board her.

228
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:38,726
That sharpshooter from Washington
just landed. Be here in 30 minutes.

229
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,518
Who did they send?
- Captain Vinton Maddox.

230
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,238
Maddox. He's a damned scalp hunter!

231
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:49,040
See that he's thoroughly briefed,
and get Captain Garth up here.

232
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:52,361
Admiral,
why don't you let me handle it?

233
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,205
No, he's entitled to a crack at me.
Phone that in.

234
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:04,285
Are those arming switches fixed?
- No, we still got some damn snafu.

235
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:10,844
Get them working 100% , or rip them
out of all our SBDs. ls that clear?

236
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,809
Yes, Sir.
- Get to it.

237
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,563
Sorry to drag you out of bed so early,
but it's our only chance to talk.

238
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,802
lt's DK. Did you get the report?
- Yup.

239
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:29,439
l've already read it.

240
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:35,080
Did you know your girl

241
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,720
belonged to those
Japanese patriotic organizations?

242
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,761
l saw the magazines,
but l didn't know it was propaganda.

243
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,206
The Attorney General's office
says it's subversive.

244
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:53,524
And the FBl doesn't think she's
telling the truth about coming here.

245
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,205
You can't blame them for that.
- Sure l can! And l can clear it up!

246
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:01,402
You cool down
and let me handle this!

247
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:07,046
Tom, l don't have time to fool around.
Do you want me to help you or not?

248
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:10,917
l guess l have no alternative,
do l, Sir?

249
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,888
l guess you don't.

250
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,245
Captain Maddox, Admiral Nimitz.
- Great pleasure, Sir.

251
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:26,198
Should we get right to it, Captain?
- Certainly, Admiral.

252
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,204
l'm sure you're aware of Washington's
opinion on this Midway invasion.

253
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,884
Yes. They think it's an enemy ruse.

254
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:36,838
An elaborate phony, Sir.
- Go on.

255
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,765
Could we speak in private?
- lf you'd feel more comfortable.

256
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,684
These enemy radio intercepts
your intelligence has accumulated ...

257
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:00,958
Very detailed ... - Too detailed.
Remember, just before December 7th?

258
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:05,923
The fake Japanese messages.
- These could be carbon copies.

259
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:11,164
Washington's sure Yamamoto's
feeding you this to hide his plans.

260
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,003
Very definitely possible.

261
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:18,288
Well, then how can you insist ...
- Because l believe it's factual.

262
00:26:18,689 --> 00:26:21,283
l'm convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.

263
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:23,806
But if you're wrong, Admiral,

264
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,167
if you send our carriers
into a Japanese ambush,

265
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:30,083
the entire West Coast and Hawaii
will be open for invasion.

266
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,525
Fully aware of that, Captain.

267
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,319
You mean, the safe play
is to defend the home folks first?

268
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,044
With respects, Admiral,
it's the smart play.

269
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,246
Captain, if we surprise the enemy,

270
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,924
catch him where he's not expecting us,

271
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,082
we can drive him back 3,000 miles.

272
00:26:55,489 --> 00:27:00,040
And keep him pinned till we can
take him on in his own front yard.

273
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,088
My instructions were
to convey Washington's deep concern

274
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:07,368
over the safety
of the West Coast and Hawaii.

275
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:11,967
ls Washington ordering me
to defend Hawaii or the West Coast?

276
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:13,964
No, Sir.

277
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,405
My orders were simply to consult.

278
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,119
No, Sir,
l have no such orders for you.

279
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:26,245
Commander Blake, send the fleet to
repel invasion. Target: Midway lsland.

280
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:28,844
lssue the order immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

281
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:33,481
Admiral, may l see you a moment?
- Excuse me, Captain.

282
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:46,638
Damn. You know how
Bill Halsey hates hospitals.

283
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,088
Maybe it's nothing serious.
- To get him anywhere near a hospital

284
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:54,959
it must be not only damn serious,
it must be critical.

285
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:59,806
Admiral, l have some really bad news.
- Today's the day for it.

286
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:04,646
The Japanese changed the J-N 25 code,
the one they used for Yamamoto's plan.

287
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:09,804
How long do you need for the new code?
- A month, maybe two.

288
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:13,326
Sir, do you still
want that fleet order issued?

289
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,725
Yes. Target: Midway.

290
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:45,327
Welcome aboard your flagship, Admiral.

291
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:47,685
Thank you, Captain.

292
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:52,799
Rear Admiral Kusaka,
my Chief of Staff. Captain Aoki.

293
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,484
Where's Commander Genda?

294
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:59,564
He's in sick bay, Admiral. lnfluenza.

295
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,880
When does the doctor think
he can resume his duties?

296
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:03,642
ln 2 or 3 days.

297
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,404
l don't like beginning this operation
without my best air commander.

298
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:14,008
We have another sick bay casualty:
Commander Fuchida has appendicitis.

299
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,201
Fuchida too?

300
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,328
We'll need a replacement.

301
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:22,448
Genda suggests
a veteran torpedo pilot:

302
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:24,885
Lieutenant Tomonaga.

303
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:29,562
lf Genda says so,
l want to see Tomonaga right away.

304
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,318
Yes, Sir.

305
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:41,199
Fuchida, the man who led
my first strike on Pearl Harbor, out.

306
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:45,124
Genda, who planned it, both ill.

307
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:49,764
Very bad luck, Sir, very bad luck.

308
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:53,521
Dnly an inconvenience, Sir.
We'll manage.

309
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:36,362
Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant.
- Follow me, please.

310
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,679
Here we are. The Sakura family.

311
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:00,321
Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant.
l can find my own way out.

312
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:12,839
Miss Sakura,
l'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.

313
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:15,319
Please come in.

314
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:22,000
My parents, Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.
This is Captain Garth.

315
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:23,603
How do you do?

316
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,082
You want to speak to me in private.
My parents understand.

317
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:31,447
Yes. Well, thank you.

318
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:42,082
lf l embarrassed you, forgive me,

319
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:47,358
but l wanted you to see that they
are not a threat to national security.

320
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:50,283
l never really
thought they would be, Miss Sakura.

321
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,601
l suppose it goes with the times.

322
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:57,081
And l shouldn't be bitter?

323
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:59,366
l never said that.

324
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:01,407
Damn it, l'm an American!

325
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:06,281
What makes us different from
German-Americans or ltalian-Americans?

326
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,688
Pearl Harbor, l guess.

327
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:16,087
Look, l've read the FBl report.

328
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:18,878
Ask me anything you want to.

329
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:20,642
Alright.

330
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:25,845
Your father has been seen frequently
entering the Japanese consulate.

331
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,922
He has old friends there.

332
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,523
l see.

333
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,842
What about these
patriotic organizations you belong to?

334
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:38,922
My father enrolled me in those
when l was born.

335
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:43,288
Dut of respect for him
l never resigned, but l wasn't active.

336
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,407
l see.

337
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:50,837
What about those magazines
they found in your parents' apartment?

338
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:54,525
The ''Prairie Shimbun''?
Published in Wyoming.

339
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,365
My father has
deep emotional ties for Japan,

340
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:02,762
but even so he thought
it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.

341
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:05,603
Why did he subscribe?

342
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,998
He's a traditional and honorable man.

343
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:12,526
He was once indebted to the man
who publishes the ''Prairie Shimbun''.

344
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:18,959
Look, Miss Sakura,
l understand you came to Hawaii

345
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:22,566
to ask your parents' permission
to marry my son.

346
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:24,479
Yes, l did.

347
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:28,404
Why didn't you tell that to the FBl?
- l didn't want to implicate Tom.

348
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,967
Why won't you see him?
He's in love with you, he tells me.

349
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:35,725
You won't even talk to him.
He doesn't understand. l don't either.

350
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,764
Because my parents have
forbidden me to marry outside my race.

351
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,160
l want you to tell him for me.

352
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:54,039
l can't tell him that.

353
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,765
He wouldn't believe me.

354
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,922
Besides, l'd just as soon
he didn't know we'd talked together.

355
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:02,528
Look, Miss Sakura,

356
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:04,848
Haruko,

357
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,565
Tom's based
at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.

358
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,561
Send for him, please.

359
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,406
You have to tell him this.
You have to tell him.

360
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,844
Damn itching is driving me crazy!

361
00:34:57,249 --> 00:35:00,844
All those medics can do is
smear this God-awful paste on it.

362
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:05,481
When they get the nerve to come near.
- l know l'm a bad patient.

363
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:10,440
But a skin disease! Df all the stupid,
useless things to get laid up with!

364
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:15,047
lt's driving me nuts. l can't even
think! - We don't have much time.

365
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:19,727
Fletcher's docking the Yorktown now,
and l've got hard decisions to make.

366
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:23,326
Recommend your replacement.
- Ray Spruance.

367
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:29,245
l know he's junior
to a lot of other flag officers,

368
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:33,801
and never served a day on a carrier.
But Chet, he knows carrier tactics.

369
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:40,797
Well, you asked for my recommendation.

370
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:45,445
l can just picture
Washington's reaction

371
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,364
if l hand over the Hornet and
the Enterprise to a cruiser skipper.

372
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:54,206
Especially with the static l'm getting
for expecting the Japanese at Midway.

373
00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:00,483
You told me once, Chet:
''When you're in command, command.''

374
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,080
Admiral Fletcher, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

375
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:09,762
Welcome home, Jack. Congratulations
on bringing your cripple in.

376
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:14,242
Well, we got lucky. - We haven't got
much time, so l'll make this fast.

377
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:19,723
Halsey's beached, in the hospital.
Won't be leaving for a while.

378
00:36:20,129 --> 00:36:25,487
l'm sending you out again, Jack,
in 72 hours. ln full combat readiness.

379
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:30,440
That's impossible! lt'll be 3 months
before the Yorktown's in commission.

380
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:35,001
Spruance has replaced Halsey. He takes
Hornet and Enterprise to sea tomorrow.

381
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:36,888
You follow him 48 hours later.

382
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,080
Spruance is a cruiser commander!
- He knows carrier tactics.

383
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,878
Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Neither can you.

384
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,645
And he sure as hell
can't learn it by tomorrow, can he?

385
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:50,684
No.

386
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:57,285
Congratulations, Ray.
- Well, l'm still in a state of shock.

387
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:00,642
Nice seeing you again, Matt.
How's the hand? - Coming fine, Sir.

388
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:03,040
We could have used you at Coral Sea.

389
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:06,646
He's on your Air Dperations staff
on the Yorktown.

390
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:08,118
Good.

391
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:15,601
We face the biggest force the enemy
has ever sortied, over 200 ships.

392
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,806
They've got 4-to-1 supremacy.

393
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:20,848
Yamamoto himself is commanding.

394
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:25,402
We know when
and from where he's going to sail,

395
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,481
we know their original courses.

396
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:33,282
We don't know their rendezvous point,
course changes or when they'll strike.

397
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:39,286
They could hit from the northwest,
but intelligence doesn't support that.

398
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:43,398
Ray, assuming
this isn't just an elaborate ruse,

399
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,082
Washington thinks it is,
but assuming they're wrong,

400
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:50,481
what kind of move do you suggest?

401
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:59,485
Well, l'd take my carriers here,
to a point northeast of Midway,

402
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,198
and wait for Nagumo's carriers.

403
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,601
Why not head northwest
and hit them head-on?

404
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:08,398
There's a chance
Washington may be right.

405
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,809
You think Hawaii and the West Coast
could be the real target?

406
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:17,647
lt doesn't really matter, provided
l'm in a position to cut them off.

407
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,117
lf it's Midway, l'll bushwhack them.

408
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:26,478
Alright. Jack, you're senior. You take
command when you join up. - Yes, Sir.

409
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:31,121
The Yorktown will be at sea
in less than 72 hours.

410
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:36,284
l don't need to stress that Yamamoto
outweighs us in every department.

411
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:41,717
Dur 3 carriers are all that stands
between the enemy fleet and our coast.

412
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:45,725
Now, your point of rendezvous,
what should we call it?

413
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,600
''Point Luck'', Sir.

414
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:54,963
Sounds like a prayer,
but it's damned appropriate.

415
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,558
Son of a bitch!

416
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,363
Nurse!

417
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:01,325
Ray.
- Hi, Bill.

418
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,598
Wanted to call the nurse
to have that tree cut down.

419
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,569
lt spoils my view of the boatyard.

420
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:10,648
Feeling DK?

421
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:15,918
l can't sleep. l can't eat.
l just sit and scratch 24 hours a day.

422
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:19,480
You ever try an oatmeal
and water bath? Don't.

423
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,368
l want to thank you for recommending
me to take your place.

424
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:26,037
l have a question:

425
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:28,605
Did that itch go to your head?

426
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:32,678
Stop underestimating yourself.

427
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,206
Any skipper who can keep
his cruisers and destroyers

428
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:40,807
alongside my carriers across the whole
Pacific is the man for the job.

429
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:43,564
You know, you and l ...

430
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:48,119
Bill, we're kind of different.

431
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,564
You think l can do it as well as you?

432
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:54,926
l can only tell you this, Ray:

433
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:58,685
You play it the way you feel it,
not the way you think l'd play it.

434
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:03,367
You go to sea, find Yamamoto and
chew his ass. Nothing more to it.

435
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:09,166
Christ, no! You want to catch this?
We'd lose the God-damned war!

436
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:17,368
Dh, by the way,

437
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:22,443
l'll have somebody cut down
that tree for you. - Yeah.

438
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:47,598
ln carrying out the task
assigned in Dp-Plan 29/ 42,

439
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:52,004
Enterprise and Hornet will act
on the principle of calculated risk,

440
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:58,366
which means avoiding exposure
to attack by superior enemy forces

441
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:04,401
without good prospect of inflicting
greater damage to the enemy.

442
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,365
Sir, three boilers
are out of commission.

443
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:42,000
The yard manager says
he needs another two days.

444
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:47,767
Delaney, l expect the yard
to finish the job by 06:00 tomorrow.

445
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:50,760
Sorry about your boiler, Jack.

446
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:53,524
But if you clear Pearl by 07:00

447
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,887
you'll rendezvous with Enterprise
and Hornet on schedule.

448
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:00,599
Agreed.
- Good luck, good hunting. - Thanks.

449
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:04,600
You too, Matt. See you back here soon.

450
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:12,765
We just haven't any future, Tom.

451
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:16,445
l figured that's what it was.

452
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,805
We don't.

453
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:20,847
We really don't.

454
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:22,523
l wish you'd go now.

455
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:28,288
l don't love you anymore.
lt was a mistake.

456
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:33,967
Say it to my face.

457
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:41,888
say it to my face, God damn it!

458
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:58,085
lt'll be DK.

459
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:02,397
Shit. Wait and see!

460
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:06,040
1919, the Marines were practicing
dive-bombing off Haiti.

461
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,883
Everybody said:
''Premature, wait and see.''

462
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:12,565
We waited, then the Germans
showed us in '37 in Madrid.

463
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:15,529
You mean like at Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor, shit!

464
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:21,242
ln '32 it was proved that Pearl Harbor
could be attacked from the air.

465
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:25,642
And Admiral Ramsey predicted
it would happen, in detail.

466
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:28,847
When was that?
- 1937, pal.

467
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:31,487
Wait and see. We waited.

468
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:34,922
December 7th, we saw.

469
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:39,322
The wait-and-seers
will bust your ass every time.

470
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:42,448
l'll drink to that.
- Bet your ...

471
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:48,128
How long have you been here?
- Long enough to hear your lecture.

472
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:51,168
You ought to go on the radio.
How the hell are you?

473
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:54,481
Alright ... Well, l'm celebrating
my birthday. That's how l am.

474
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:56,925
That's a problem
we all have once a year.

475
00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:01,039
My God,
now you got my kid flying for you.

476
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:03,599
How's the boy doing?
- Just fine.

477
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:09,083
He's a good pilot. Got him in an F4F.
He'll be shipping out any day.

478
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:12,359
Coming from you that means a lot.

479
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:18,127
No. He's good man, a natural pilot,
good attitude, good marksman.

480
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:24,684
Tom's only deficiency
would be in enemy identification.

481
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:30,126
He's got to learn, you don't win a war
by kissing the enemy.

482
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:34,124
For Christ's sake ... - Well, he told
the whole God-damned squadron.

483
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:38,044
l met her. She seems like a nice girl.
- So is Madame Butterfly.

484
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:42,328
She's having trouble with him.
- Now you're having trouble seeing.

485
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:44,924
l've got to shove off.

486
00:44:47,129 --> 00:44:51,645
Scuttlebutt says you're going out
on the Yorktown. - That's right.

487
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:56,759
Well, keep your dumb ass
out of drafts. - That's right, buddy.

488
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:00,520
Thanks for keeping an eye on my boy.
l appreciate it.

489
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:03,322
He'll be fine, Matt.

490
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:17,286
Tom! - Nice of you
to take the time to see me off, Dad.

491
00:45:17,689 --> 00:45:20,965
But your squadron isn't due to ship
for a week. Why are you boarding?

492
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:25,920
Are you saying you're surprised, Sir?
Your buddy Jessop transferred me.

493
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:28,206
l didn't know anything about it!
- Like hell you didn't!

494
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:33,279
You wanted me shipped out,
to stop me from doing anything stupid!

495
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,841
So your old buddy Jessop obliged.
- Tom, l knew nothing about it!

496
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:40,444
l have to report on board, Sir.

497
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,558
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE

498
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:01,837
DK, Sir.

499
00:46:08,129 --> 00:46:12,964
Captain Garth is here, Sir.
- Great. Come in, Matt. How are you?

500
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:18,800
l'm gonna do something l don't do,
at least not since Annapolis.

501
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:25,079
l'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.
- Ask away! Lord knows l owe you some.

502
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:31,280
This is an FBl enemy alien report.
- Where did you get this?

503
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:32,884
Don't ask.

504
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:36,361
Matt, l could find out.
- Don't, Harry.

505
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:45,565
The report contains all the bureau
has on ... - A Japanese?

506
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:50,720
Dn an American citizen
named Haruko Sakura und her parents.

507
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,758
They look DK to me,
but l'm not in your business.

508
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:58,046
lt sounds like you are.

509
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:03,684
Harry, l want you
to investigate this personally.

510
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,884
They'll be sent
to the mainland next week.

511
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:10,367
lf they're clean,
and l'm betting they are,

512
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:12,600
l want that shipment cancelled.

513
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:17,480
Matt, you're way out of line here!
This isn't your department!

514
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:20,198
This is tampering!

515
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:26,640
Alright, what have we got?

516
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:29,609
What are these people to you?

517
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:35,008
Someday,
the girl may be my daughter-in-law.

518
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:42,519
You're pressuring me to take
improper action for personal reasons.

519
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:45,204
lmproper action, hell!

520
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:48,567
They're no more
a threat to national security

521
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:51,164
than your pet Airedale.

522
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:58,040
l'll have to report your request.
lt'll go into your record.

523
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,723
lt's not for me.

524
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:05,718
You know l wouldn't ask you
for myself. l'm asking you for my kid.

525
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:08,120
Jesus Christ, Harry!

526
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:10,840
l'm begging you!

527
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:22,682
Alright, l'll investigate it.

528
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,568
Thanks, Harry.

529
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,727
And, Captain,

530
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:38,445
this'll wash it with us.

531
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:44,241
We're even.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

532
00:48:56,489 --> 00:48:57,683
Captain?

533
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:01,446
Thank you, Corporal.

534
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:04,687
Reporting as ordered, Sir.

535
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:09,401
Sorry to send the Marines after you,
but you didn't answer my messages.

536
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:12,004
We had nothing to talk about, Captain.

537
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:15,799
You can cut out that midshipman-crap,
you're talking to your old man.

538
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:18,042
l'll try to remember it.

539
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:24,163
l'd like to set the record straight:
Before we left Pearl,

540
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:28,721
l personally vouched
for Haruko and her parents,

541
00:49:29,129 --> 00:49:31,199
and went way out on a limb for them.

542
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:34,282
l didn't know
what weight it would carry,

543
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:36,919
but you know, there it is.

544
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:38,523
Thanks.

545
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:42,360
Dne more thing:

546
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:46,324
l didn't ask your C.D.
to ship you out.

547
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:49,448
You spoke to him, didn't you?
- Yes, l did.

548
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:53,400
He asked me how l felt about ...
- Haruko and me, right?

549
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:58,007
lf you couldn't do anything about it,
why couldn't you leave it alone?

550
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:01,322
Jessop thought
he was doing us both a favor.

551
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:04,846
l did all l could,
and a lot more than l should've.

552
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,285
You're paid to fly fighter planes,

553
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,806
not to sit in your cabin
and cry over your girl's picture.

554
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:15,487
You better shape up, Tiger, before
a hot-shot Jap pilot flames your ass!

555
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:32,517
Just received this message, Sir.

556
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:36,524
Dperation K, the reconnaissance flight
to Pearl Harbor, has been cancelled.

557
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:39,204
Cancelled? Why?

558
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:42,885
Dur scout planes couldn't refuel.
An enemy vessel was there.

559
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:49,602
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's carrier force
should be warned immediately.

560
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:53,797
Admiral Nagumo must have picked up
the transmission when we did.

561
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:55,324
Suppose he didn't.

562
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,846
He will assume the American carriers
are at Pearl Harbor.

563
00:50:59,249 --> 00:51:02,480
And that is where our latest
intelligence reports place them.

564
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:05,403
What latest intelligence reports?

565
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:10,280
Have any of our submarines sighted
the US fleet in the last 20 hours?

566
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:17,003
No, Sir. But there's no logical reason
for them to move their carriers.

567
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:22,039
We must not break radio silence and
risk letting them know our location.

568
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:28,524
The element of surprise is one of the
most important aspects of our attack.

569
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:46,761
Admiral, this is our search plan.

570
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:50,725
An air search involving 22 PBYs,

571
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:54,678
each plane flying 700 miles out,
covering an 8-degree sector.

572
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:57,808
We'll have a 180-degree view
at anything coming from the west,

573
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:01,485
and still have a flanking area
northeast of Midway for our carriers.

574
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:05,040
Have it put into operation right away.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

575
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:19,519
Jesus, how many of those can you eat?

576
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,601
Admiral, air reconnaissance report.

577
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,839
No sightings.

578
00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:01,798
ls there any defense measure
we've overlooked?

579
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:04,200
That had top priority, Admiral.

580
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:09,922
You sent everything we had:
tanks, PT boats, anti-aircraft guns.

581
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:15,164
lt's miserable waiting for an attack
on your own people, hoping it happens.

582
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:18,447
More pressure from Washington?
- Not a whisper.

583
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:22,558
Frankly,
l'd rather have them raising hell.

584
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:42,808
Captain.
- What's the count, Reid?

585
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:45,723
Half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.

586
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:50,368
Damned relics. - We'll show the Japs
we're up here. Maybe we'll get lucky.

587
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:52,288
DK, Reid.

588
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:11,328
ln less than 5 hours
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians,

589
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:15,722
and we will still be groping to Midway
in this filthy squall.

590
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:19,917
We're not due to launch
our first air strike for 36 hours.

591
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:23,048
Dur predictions are for clear weather
before then, Admiral.

592
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:27,677
l keep wondering what Dperation K
uncovered at Pearl Harbor.

593
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:30,159
Were the American carriers there?

594
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:36,400
We've heard nothing from Yamamoto.
The American carriers must be there.

595
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:41,402
Damn communications blackout!

596
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:54,759
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!

597
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:56,238
Here we go.

598
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:11,647
Well, Gentlemen, it's started.
Signal Spruance.

599
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:20,122
The Aleutian lslands
are being invaded, Admiral.

600
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:29,840
Washington could still be right.

601
00:56:30,249 --> 00:56:34,925
lt could be a feint for an attack
on the West Coast or here in Hawaii.

602
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:37,001
Dr what we've defended against.

603
00:56:37,409 --> 00:56:41,561
Today. Dur PBY should tell us today.

604
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:06,198
Hey, do you see what l see?

605
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:09,808
Damn right, l do!

606
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:16,568
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio: Main body.

607
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:20,200
That's all? Just ''Main body''?
- Send it! - Yes, Sir.

608
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:27,605
An American PBY, Sir.
A reconnaissance seaplane!

609
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:33,244
Radio's picked up it's transmission.
lt's alerting Midway.

610
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:35,082
Break radio silence.

611
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:39,846
Advise Admiral Yamamoto:
lnvasion force has been discovered.

612
00:57:41,129 --> 00:57:47,477
6 large ships in a column, bearing
262 degrees, distance 700 miles.

613
00:57:50,329 --> 00:57:55,084
Admiral.
- You were right, it's Midway.

614
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:57,320
Enigma!

615
00:57:58,249 --> 00:58:02,208
You know what l mean, Admiral.
- Fletcher's joined Spruance on time.

616
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:07,682
Another one from Strawberry-9, Sir.

617
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:12,048
11 ships, course 090, speed 19 knots.

618
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:14,519
Just what kind of ships?

619
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:19,127
First transmission said ''Main body'',
but didn't mention carriers.

620
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:25,559
That PBY, Strawberry-9,
was at the end of his 700-mile leg.

621
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:29,167
Nagumo's carriers could be
following the large ships.

622
00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:31,400
Maybe beyond his horizon.

623
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:35,245
lf they are, Fletcher's too far north.

624
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:40,040
He has to move at top speed now to get
within striking distance by sunset.

625
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:43,646
But if Nagumo's carriers are
coming in behind the storm front ...

626
00:58:44,049 --> 00:58:46,279
Fletcher'd be caught
between two forces.

627
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:50,045
Yes, if we let him head
for that main body sighting.

628
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:58,839
Send a flash message to Fletcher:
This is not, repeat, NDT main body.

629
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:02,082
Expect enemy carrier strike
tomorrow behind storm front ...

630
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:06,767
... via northwest, as anticipated.
Signed, Nimitz.

631
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:13,245
CinCPAC must think the PBY
sighted only Kondo's invasion force.

632
00:59:13,649 --> 00:59:16,880
But if it's Nagumo's attack force
with its carriers,

633
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:20,520
and its scouts find us
before we find them ...

634
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,367
Sound general quarters!

635
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:44,840
Weather is clearing, Admiral.
We could not have timed it better.

636
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:49,686
We intercepted a radio transmission
from Tokyo to Admiral Yamamoto.

637
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:56,085
lntelligence does not report
any movement of the American fleet.

638
00:59:56,489 --> 00:59:59,799
Whatever doubts we may have had ...
- They still are with me, Kusaka.

639
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:04,202
We have no definitive intelligence
reports, only opinions and estimates.

640
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:07,646
And Yamamoto's silence
does not make them a fact.

641
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:11,200
Admiral.
- Genda.

642
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:19,642
My apologies. l've been
away from my duties much too long.

643
01:00:20,689 --> 01:00:22,805
Genda, how are you?

644
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:28,124
l'm well enough
to take charge of air operations.

645
01:00:28,529 --> 01:00:31,885
And so you shall, my friend.

646
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:37,087
Prepare an air search plan right away.
- For what area?

647
01:00:37,489 --> 01:00:42,244
Where l would deploy my carriers
if l were an American commander.

648
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:46,961
There, northeast of Midway.

649
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:57,278
Times like this,
Joe, l miss the flatlands.

650
01:00:58,289 --> 01:01:03,807
lt's a big body of water out there.
l'm a fella from the Texas prairie.

651
01:01:04,209 --> 01:01:07,406
Nearest lake was 120 miles away.

652
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:10,642
You could wade across it
at the height of the rainy season.

653
01:01:11,049 --> 01:01:13,609
During summer
we made clay pots out of its bottom.

654
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:23,008
Whatever happens, Joe, you sure
as hell earned your pay this month.

655
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,085
Well, thank you, Sir.

656
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:32,763
To cover the area, we will launch
scout planes from Akagi and Kaga,

657
01:01:33,169 --> 01:01:36,206
and our cruiser escorts
will launch 5 seaplanes.

658
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:40,565
Very good. And until our scouts
have searched the area,

659
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:44,644
we'll hold our most experienced pilots
and half our aircraft in reserve.

660
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,368
But the American fleet

661
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:51,047
can't be anywhere near Midway. We
shouldn't hold back our best pilots.

662
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:53,719
We've been over this before.

663
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:57,758
Admiral,
our first strike must be decisive.

664
01:01:58,169 --> 01:02:03,368
lf we don't destroy Midway's airstrip
and planes, we invite a counterstrike.

665
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:06,442
Commander Genda?

666
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:11,441
l agree with you, Sir.

667
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:14,119
Let our younger pilots
fly the first strike.

668
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:19,523
l am sure they can do the job.
lf not, we can launch a second strike.

669
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:21,999
That is how it will be.

670
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:30,087
Suddenly, the man who led us
to victory at Pearl Harbor

671
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,559
is choked by caution.

672
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:35,358
He senses danger out there.

673
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:38,047
So do l.

674
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:43,641
Their transports wouldn't be so close
if they didn't plan to invade soon.

675
01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:46,279
CinCPAC's right.
They'll hit Midway today.

676
01:02:46,689 --> 01:02:49,567
Yes, but from where?
He could pop out anywhere.

677
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:54,799
And then his scout planes will be out.
- We have to find him first.

678
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:56,801
lf he hits our blind side ...

679
01:02:57,209 --> 01:03:03,318
Why don't we get some eyes out there?
10 SBDs will cover our northern flank.

680
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,685
DK. But no more than 100 miles out.

681
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:10,719
l want to recover them fast,
in case the PBYs make contact first.

682
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:39,121
You DK?
- Yeah. - Here.

683
01:03:41,129 --> 01:03:45,964
The poor bastards'll miss all the fun.
There's nothing north of us but ocean.

684
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:49,327
He gets his dope straight
from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean?

685
01:03:49,729 --> 01:03:53,563
Wrong, from here.
When it bristles there's Japs around.

686
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:55,925
You're crazy!

687
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,282
'Morning, Captain. - You're supposed
to be sacked out. What're you doing?

688
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:04,167
We couldn't sleep.

689
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:10,204
l know, but get below and try.
We got a heavy day ahead.

690
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:13,763
Yes, Sir.

691
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:43,362
Excellent weather forecast.

692
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:47,523
Broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet
to conceal us from enemy scout planes,

693
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:52,719
and above unlimited visibility
straight into Midway for our flyers.

694
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:57,048
Commence launching.

695
01:05:33,249 --> 01:05:38,243
All our cruisers' scout planes
are in the air, except one.

696
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:41,163
The Tone is having catapult problems.

697
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:45,000
A delay in launching scout 4.
- How long?

698
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:47,724
Half an hour, Sir.

699
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:50,438
ln case the Americans suddenly appear,

700
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:54,922
l suggest bringing the 2nd flight wave
on deck as soon as the 1st is clear.

701
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:59,681
Armed with torpedoes
to deal with enemy carriers? - Yes.

702
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,647
Dur planes and the Kaga's.

703
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:06,361
Soryu and Hiryu can stand by
with bombs for Midway.

704
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:11,398
Give the order.
- Yes, Sir.

705
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:43,807
Now it's up to our strike leader.

706
01:06:44,689 --> 01:06:47,647
Tomonaga is the best we've got.

707
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:18,518
Howie?

708
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:30,159
lt's the whole damn Jap navy!

709
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:36,560
Radio, raise Midway.
Send: Enemy carriers.

710
01:07:39,649 --> 01:07:44,439
We got 'em! lt's Jap fighter cover.
- Let's duck into the clouds.

711
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:58,918
''Enemy carriers''? That's all?

712
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:03,800
That's all Strawberry-5 said.
We haven't heard from him since.

713
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:09,608
lf he was on course and on schedule,
he made the contact about here,

714
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:12,284
250 miles out.

715
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:15,249
You better signal it to Spruance.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

716
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,407
You certain it was Strawberry-5?

717
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,287
Positive, Skipper.

718
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:36,484
How far are we
from that contact point?

719
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:38,447
We're 15 minutes behind schedule.

720
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:42,728
Bandits! Sweet mother of God,
hundreds! - Where, damn it?

721
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:46,443
Four ... no, five o'clock!

722
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:50,161
Jesus!

723
01:08:54,809 --> 01:08:58,438
Billy, send this quick:
Many planes heading Midway.

724
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,648
Are you certain?

725
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:04,086
Alright, just let us know
the second you get anything else.

726
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:08,004
Nothing more. No word from our scouts
since that ''Many planes'' flash.

727
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:12,766
Yes, but was that from Strawberry-5?
- No call letters were sent.

728
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:16,199
Maybe he was jumped
by enemy fighters.

729
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:21,160
Damn it! How many carriers?
What course? What speed?

730
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:24,444
Those Japs
will never find us in this soup.

731
01:09:24,849 --> 01:09:30,560
And we'll never find their carriers
unless we break into the clear.

732
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:34,086
Damn it!
l should've risked going straight in.

733
01:09:42,849 --> 01:09:45,317
Nothin'. We've lost 'em!

734
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:51,525
Lieutenant, they're behind us!
l see 2 carriers and a battleship.

735
01:09:52,009 --> 01:09:54,398
Send it!
- Aye-aye, Sir.

736
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:08,163
''Fletcher to Spruance. Second
sighting reported, Strawberry-5:

737
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:12,767
2 enemy carriers, battleship.
Bearing: Midway, 320 degrees.

738
01:10:13,169 --> 01:10:17,401
Distance: 180 miles.
Course: 135 degrees.

739
01:10:17,809 --> 01:10:20,118
Speed: 25 knots.''

740
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:22,599
Came right out of the slot
where Nimitz figured.

741
01:10:23,089 --> 01:10:26,479
''Proceed southwesterly,
attack enemy carriers.

742
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,881
Will follow as soon as
search planes recovered. Fletcher.''

743
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:33,167
Signal ''Ahoy'', Captain Browning.

744
01:10:34,089 --> 01:10:35,920
To battle stations.

745
01:11:07,849 --> 01:11:11,398
Get the control tower.

746
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:16,718
Andy, Major Parks get his fighters up?

747
01:11:17,129 --> 01:11:20,360
All 23. The SBDs are ready to go.

748
01:11:20,769 --> 01:11:22,600
Get 'em airborne.
- Yes, Sir.

749
01:11:23,009 --> 01:11:26,285
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.

750
01:11:28,049 --> 01:11:32,201
Rainbow Leader.
Below us, 10 o'clock.

751
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:37,961
l see 'em, Kirk.
Alright, everybody.

752
01:11:38,369 --> 01:11:41,167
Let's see how many
we can drop on the first pass.

753
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:51,561
Two bogies under you!

754
01:11:55,809 --> 01:11:59,927
Got one! Look at that Jap bastard!

755
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:05,840
Get him off me!

756
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:12,999
Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you!

757
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:19,085
l'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
My God! Mayday, mayday!

758
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,724
Look out, Rainbow! Dn your tail!

759
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:25,518
Comin' in on you! Three of 'em!

760
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:37,879
Look at that Jap bastard!

761
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:44,407
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out! Two bogies, four o'clock!

762
01:12:45,009 --> 01:12:47,807
Rainbow Leader, come in!
This is Noah's Ark.

763
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:51,758
Report please!
What is your condition? Report!

764
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:54,004
Good God!

765
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:56,559
Give me the tower.

766
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:01,639
Andy, they blew
right through Parks' fighters!

767
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:04,358
Get your people under shelter!

768
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:20,998
Jesus!

769
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:23,038
Come on!

770
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:32,045
Attack in squadron order!

771
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:55,488
God, they creamed us!
- But we're not out of action yet.

772
01:14:55,889 --> 01:14:58,403
Dur landing strip's still operational.

773
01:15:27,889 --> 01:15:30,608
Tomonaga
is asking for a second strike.

774
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:35,885
Sir, this report is a great victory.
We've lost only 7 planes.

775
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:40,168
We've destroyed 40 enemy aircraft,
in the air and on the ground.

776
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:44,960
But the pilots you chose
did not destroy the airstrip.

777
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:49,960
We have 93 planes and our best pilots
waiting on our flight decks.

778
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:52,519
The entire force should be sent now.

779
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:58,287
The entire force? Dur planes are armed
with torpedoes on Genda's advice.

780
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:01,601
Hardly suitable for bombing
an airstrip. Correct, Commander?

781
01:16:02,249 --> 01:16:05,366
They should be immediately
rearmed with bombs below deck.

782
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:10,399
We must make certain
that Midway can mount no air attacks.

783
01:16:10,969 --> 01:16:14,439
Lieutenant Tomonaga's request
is also a warning.

784
01:16:14,849 --> 01:16:16,885
Midway is still a threat to us.

785
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:19,439
So are the American carriers.

786
01:16:19,929 --> 01:16:21,726
lf they are nearby, yes.

787
01:16:22,129 --> 01:16:24,882
But after 2 hours,
our scouts have reported nothing.

788
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:28,918
You're forgetting, scout number 4
was a half-hour late taking off.

789
01:16:29,329 --> 01:16:32,878
lt will not reach it's maximum
search range for another hour.

790
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:45,237
Tomonaga's planes
will be returning soon.

791
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:49,847
They can be quickly refueled
and rearmed for sea action.

792
01:16:50,249 --> 01:16:54,401
ln case our scouts
sight any enemy ships.

793
01:16:54,809 --> 01:16:56,288
Admiral?

794
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:01,328
Very well.

795
01:17:01,729 --> 01:17:04,368
Drder our torpedo bombers
to be rearmed with contact bombs.

796
01:17:04,769 --> 01:17:09,559
As soon as they are ready,
we will launch a 2nd strike on Midway.

797
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:43,446
57 planes on the line, Sir.

798
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:47,000
The Hornet will probably
launch about the same number.

799
01:17:48,049 --> 01:17:53,043
What's the enemy carriers' position?
- 135 miles, Sir.

800
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:56,486
lf we launch immediately,
do our pilots have enough fuel?

801
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:59,244
Yes, Sir. lf the weather holds,

802
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:02,925
they navigate perfectly and
aren't over the target too long.

803
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:08,562
lf we launch now, we might
catch Nagumo like a sitting duck.

804
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:13,997
lf we wait, it will give him time
to refuel and reload.

805
01:18:14,729 --> 01:18:17,289
Sir, the PBY reported only 2 carriers.

806
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:20,522
l know.
- lntelligence says he has 4.

807
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:24,842
lf those other 2 suddenly pop up ...
- Then we'd be sitting ducks.

808
01:18:28,649 --> 01:18:33,120
But we have 2 certain targets
135 miles away that don't expect it.

809
01:18:36,209 --> 01:18:40,646
Let's get Enterprise
and Hornet turned into the wind.

810
01:18:45,649 --> 01:18:47,002
lt's from Admiral Spruance.

811
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:52,278
Enterprise and Hornet are launching
every aircraft they've got.

812
01:19:00,889 --> 01:19:04,723
Air controller reports our strike
force will be over the deck in 1 hour.

813
01:19:05,129 --> 01:19:08,838
Just the time we need to finish
arming our bombers for the 2nd strike.

814
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:12,321
Your confidence
is most reassuring, Kusaka.

815
01:19:12,889 --> 01:19:17,963
Dur scouts report no enemy carriers.
They've started their homeward leg.

816
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:22,688
All except scout number 4.

817
01:19:41,729 --> 01:19:43,162
10 enemy ships sighted.

818
01:19:43,569 --> 01:19:50,361
Bearing: 010 degrees. Distance: 240
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.

819
01:19:50,929 --> 01:19:54,285
Which scout radioed the contact?
- Number 4, Sir.

820
01:19:57,409 --> 01:20:00,082
How far along are we on rearming?
- Almost half, Sir.

821
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:02,127
Drder it halted.

822
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:07,045
Radio scout 4 to ascertain
ship types and maintain contact.

823
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:19,083
Friendlies, Sir.
Dur search planes returning.

824
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:22,720
They'll be on board
in under 15 minutes.

825
01:20:23,129 --> 01:20:25,279
Have Captain Buckmaster see to it.

826
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:30,922
Dur planes from Enterprise and Hornet
should hit the Jap carriers in 1 hour.

827
01:20:31,329 --> 01:20:34,287
They're not on the same course?

828
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:37,157
We're counting on it, Admiral.

829
01:20:37,569 --> 01:20:42,723
Nagumo has to hold course
until he recovers his planes.

830
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:47,407
240 degrees puts our people on him
with unfueled aircraft on his decks.

831
01:21:02,009 --> 01:21:05,684
l don't see our fighters, Sir.
They should've caught up to us by now.

832
01:21:06,089 --> 01:21:07,568
And where's Bombing 8?

833
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:10,638
With Fighting 8.
They took off together.

834
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:14,202
Ain't they supposed to be with us?

835
01:21:16,489 --> 01:21:19,049
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3.

836
01:21:19,889 --> 01:21:22,244
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3!

837
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:25,527
Either my compass is fouled up,
or we're not heading 240.

838
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:31,481
There's nothing out there.
l know where the Japs are, Mr. Gay.

839
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:35,121
Will you tell us, Sir?

840
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:40,923
l figure they moved east
since we launched, away from Midway.

841
01:21:43,729 --> 01:21:47,517
Roger. - What good's our orders,
if the skipper's gonna lead us off?

842
01:21:48,009 --> 01:21:49,158
l don't like it.

843
01:21:49,969 --> 01:21:51,527
Take it easy.

844
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:56,719
lf anybody can find the Japs,
Waldron can. He's part Sioux lndian!

845
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:06,925
Sir, another message from scout 4.

846
01:22:08,889 --> 01:22:13,644
3 additional enemy ships sighted, 250
miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.

847
01:22:14,049 --> 01:22:18,361
Apparently 2 cruisers,
a carrier believed to be the Yorktown.

848
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:22,444
lmpossible. The Yorktown was
virtually destroyed at Coral Sea.

849
01:22:22,849 --> 01:22:26,285
They can't have repaired her
and brought her here in 10 days.

850
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:28,884
We must assume they have!

851
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:31,678
lf it is it,
we must destroy her at once.

852
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:34,440
l see.

853
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:37,079
Suddenly, the threat
from Midway's bombers seems

854
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:42,643
less to you than when you urged me
to rearm our planes with bombs!

855
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:45,722
Admiral, Midway must wait.

856
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:49,007
We should rearm our bombers
and attack that carrier.

857
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:51,958
Back to torpedoes again?

858
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:57,489
More wasted time! - Tomonaga,
this is Genda. Do you read me?

859
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:03,408
Lieutenant Tomonaga,
this is Commander Genda.

860
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:07,165
Do you read me?
- l read you, Sir. - Report please.

861
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:12,597
Request permission to land. My pilots
report almost empty fuel tanks.

862
01:23:13,009 --> 01:23:17,321
Some have taken anti-aircraft hits.
Urgent we land immediately, Sir.

863
01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:19,881
Do l have permission?

864
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:24,607
Admiral Yamaguchi advises
that we attack the enemy carrier and

865
01:23:25,009 --> 01:23:27,204
launch our bombers at once,
however they're armed.

866
01:23:27,609 --> 01:23:31,204
While we're launching, Sir, Tomonaga's
pilots will crash into the sea!

867
01:23:31,969 --> 01:23:34,767
They're running out of fuel, Admiral.

868
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:43,237
Alright.

869
01:23:44,249 --> 01:23:47,366
Wait until we've recovered
all our airborne aircraft.

870
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:52,479
While they are landing on the deck,
rearm our bomber with torpedoes.

871
01:23:52,889 --> 01:23:55,198
Then we'll attack the enemy carrier.

872
01:24:07,689 --> 01:24:10,487
That's the last of our scouts, Sir.

873
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:14,879
Tell Eliot to launch all we've got.
- Aye-aye, Sir.

874
01:24:23,209 --> 01:24:25,200
Pilots, man your planes!

875
01:25:53,009 --> 01:25:55,967
Admiral, all aircraft now on board.

876
01:25:56,369 --> 01:25:59,645
Tomonaga?
- He was the last to touch down.

877
01:26:00,929 --> 01:26:06,162
l want to close range on the enemy
carrier. Steer northeast. Full speed!

878
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:18,883
From Admiral Nagumo:

879
01:26:19,289 --> 01:26:22,918
''Enemy force composed of
1 carrier, 5 cruisers, 5 destroyers,

880
01:26:23,329 --> 01:26:26,162
sighted 250 miles from Midway.
We are headed for it.''

881
01:26:26,569 --> 01:26:28,002
Dne carrier?

882
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:33,317
Close to Midway. Not Pearl Harbor!

883
01:26:33,849 --> 01:26:39,242
Admiral Nagumo will simply destroy it
a few days earlier than planned.

884
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:46,286
Dh, thanks, Matt.

885
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:49,408
l'd give my retirement pay
to know what Nagumo's doing.

886
01:26:49,809 --> 01:26:53,597
The same thing we are, Admiral,
sweating it out.

887
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:06,404
Skipper!

888
01:27:11,889 --> 01:27:13,481
l see it.

889
01:27:14,449 --> 01:27:18,965
What'd l tell you, Huntington?
The skipper can smell them out.

890
01:27:23,009 --> 01:27:26,285
See if you can raise Bombing 8
and Fighting 8. They must be near.

891
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:29,408
Better coordinate the attack.
- Yes, Sir.

892
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:34,803
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!

893
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:38,201
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Do you read me?

894
01:27:40,009 --> 01:27:43,843
DK, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobs.

895
01:27:44,249 --> 01:27:46,479
Red Fox Leader to Kits,
we're going in!

896
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:51,405
Divisions 2 and 4, take the carrier.
Divisions 1 and 3, ram the escorts.

897
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:57,725
And stay together as long as you can.
l say again: stay in tight!

898
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:15,522
Admiral, enemy torpedo bombers
off port quarter!

899
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:30,208
They're coming in
without fighter protection.

900
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:32,804
Mindless suicide!

901
01:28:33,209 --> 01:28:35,928
Perhaps.
But it's an effective technique.

902
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:39,799
We can't attack their carrier
while we're busy dodging them.

903
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:41,927
They're using up all our fighters.

904
01:28:42,329 --> 01:28:46,163
Bandits, 11 o'clock! Look out!

905
01:28:46,569 --> 01:28:48,844
Two of them. Shoot, shoot!

906
01:28:52,769 --> 01:28:56,557
This is Kit 6, l got 3 of them
on my tail. Somebody help me!

907
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:09,766
Below you, bandits! No, no!

908
01:29:12,409 --> 01:29:14,684
Dh God damn! No!

909
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:27,887
Stay in formation!

910
01:29:28,289 --> 01:29:32,328
Get in. Close up, you idiots!
They'll jump us to pieces!

911
01:29:32,729 --> 01:29:34,481
l'm hit, l'm hit! Dh, Jesus!

912
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:43,207
Dobs, behind you! Bandits behind you!

913
01:29:43,889 --> 01:29:44,878
Look out!

914
01:29:49,129 --> 01:29:51,802
Huntington, coming in at 10 o'clock!

915
01:30:00,689 --> 01:30:02,088
Huntington!

916
01:30:03,089 --> 01:30:04,966
Huntington, are you dead?

917
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:10,002
Follow me.

918
01:30:29,489 --> 01:30:31,127
Waldron, get your nose up!

919
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:35,485
Pull up, pull up!

920
01:31:31,089 --> 01:31:34,001
What happened?
- Dne of our torpedo groups attacked.

921
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:37,719
Yeah, but which one?
What the hell happened?

922
01:31:41,089 --> 01:31:44,240
Casualty report, Sir:
Dne of our fighters took a minor hit,

923
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:48,119
no shipboard damage, no casualties.

924
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:57,683
A whole squadron. 15 brave crews.

925
01:32:17,009 --> 01:32:19,239
Torpedo 3 going in at 1,500 feet.

926
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:22,322
Bombing 3 and Fighting 3 at 1,900.
15 minutes to target.

927
01:32:22,729 --> 01:32:26,483
Who's coordinating the attack?
- Max Leslie. He's leading Bombing 3.

928
01:32:40,209 --> 01:32:43,440
Helen Leader to Helen group:
Time to arm your bombs.

929
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:46,761
l say again: Arm bombs!

930
01:32:51,329 --> 01:32:52,444
God damn it!

931
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,967
Don't touch
that damned electric arming switch!

932
01:32:58,369 --> 01:33:01,088
Use manual control!

933
01:33:01,489 --> 01:33:05,198
Too late, Commander. Mine dropped.
- Mine dropped too.

934
01:33:05,609 --> 01:33:08,203
Rotten gadget! Who the hell
invented the electric arming switch?

935
01:33:08,609 --> 01:33:12,966
Yamamoto, who else? Now what?
Should we drop spitballs on the Japs?

936
01:33:13,369 --> 01:33:16,725
Alright, knock it off.
The rest, use manual control!

937
01:33:18,209 --> 01:33:20,006
Helen Leader, out.

938
01:33:44,249 --> 01:33:47,764
Skipper, look at Chili Bean over here!

939
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:51,398
l feel them!

940
01:33:52,329 --> 01:33:54,001
Hope he's right.

941
01:34:06,769 --> 01:34:08,282
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader,

942
01:34:08,689 --> 01:34:12,364
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
Japs on the horizon!

943
01:34:12,769 --> 01:34:17,126
l got 3 ...
Sweet Jesus, l got 4 Jap carriers!

944
01:34:18,529 --> 01:34:21,726
Holy hell, we hit the jackpot!

945
01:34:27,809 --> 01:34:30,721
Yes, sky watch?
- Enemy torpedo planes! - How many?

946
01:34:31,129 --> 01:34:33,563
Two separate groups.

947
01:34:39,209 --> 01:34:43,441
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
How's about it? You boys ready?

948
01:34:44,129 --> 01:34:47,519
Damn right, we're ready!
Let's go, we're running out of fuel!

949
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:50,443
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader to Small Fry:

950
01:34:50,849 --> 01:34:55,206
Concentrate on the closest flattop.
Push in close and get hits!

951
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:58,442
l count 12
coming in from starboard, Admiral.

952
01:34:58,849 --> 01:35:00,646
14 from port side, Sir!

953
01:35:01,049 --> 01:35:03,609
All these can't be from one carrier.

954
01:35:04,009 --> 01:35:07,763
They must be coming from Midway.
- Dr a second carrier.

955
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:12,208
We've heard nothing from scout 4 since
it sighted the one enemy carrier.

956
01:35:12,609 --> 01:35:14,600
Soryu should send out its scout plane.

957
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:18,206
We must make certain
of what we're up against.

958
01:35:18,609 --> 01:35:20,918
See to it immediately.
- Yes, Sir.

959
01:35:33,849 --> 01:35:36,443
Lining up to jump us, Thach.
About 12 Japs.

960
01:35:37,329 --> 01:35:41,288
We're right above them.
Mabel 3 to Hustlers: Break 'em up!

961
01:35:59,689 --> 01:36:03,841
Score 1 for Commander Thach!
Bogy! Comin' in on you, 3 of 'em!

962
01:36:07,289 --> 01:36:10,645
That a boy, Tom!
Run that bastard into the drink!

963
01:36:15,209 --> 01:36:16,801
Ramos, 2 o'clock!

964
01:36:24,689 --> 01:36:25,758
Nice shootin' !

965
01:36:31,889 --> 01:36:33,925
More comin' in at 1 o'clock!

966
01:36:39,249 --> 01:36:41,843
You got him! Nice goin' !

967
01:36:47,569 --> 01:36:52,040
Mabel 3 Leader to Hustler Tom:
3 bandits at 12 o'clock divin' on you!

968
01:36:52,449 --> 01:36:54,838
Roll out, Tom! Dive, dive!

969
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:24,959
We've quashed all of their attacks,
and not one torpedo has come close.

970
01:37:25,369 --> 01:37:28,679
Sacrifice themselves like samurai,
these Americans.

971
01:37:29,089 --> 01:37:34,083
That last attack pulled our entire
fighter cover down to sea level.

972
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:36,844
Now they're looking for survivors.

973
01:37:37,849 --> 01:37:40,283
We have no fighter umbrella over us?
- No, Sir.

974
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:44,284
We're trying to recall them,
get them back up to patrol altitude.

975
01:37:44,689 --> 01:37:49,080
How many fighters are standing by
to cover our attack on that carrier?

976
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:51,719
Barely enough to do the job.

977
01:38:16,289 --> 01:38:19,486
They're American carriers,
no doubt about it, Yorktown class.

978
01:38:19,889 --> 01:38:22,357
Get through
to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick!

979
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,568
Why are you waiting?

980
01:38:30,969 --> 01:38:34,041
The transmitter isn't working.
We're not sending out any signal!

981
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:50,486
What's it look like down there?

982
01:38:54,769 --> 01:38:56,088
A Jap destroyer!

983
01:38:57,049 --> 01:38:59,882
Going someplace
in one hell of a hurry.

984
01:39:04,329 --> 01:39:06,524
DK, follow it. See where it leads us.

985
01:39:07,689 --> 01:39:11,318
Commander McClusky, look at
the fuel gauge. We have to turn back.

986
01:39:11,729 --> 01:39:13,720
l know, l know.

987
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:24,762
The last two attacks were made
by over 50 torpedo planes. 50!

988
01:39:25,169 --> 01:39:28,559
There is more than one
enemy carrier nearby. There must be!

989
01:39:28,969 --> 01:39:32,120
Admiral. - Genda, why hasn't
the Soryu's scout plane reported?

990
01:39:32,529 --> 01:39:35,885
We don't know. lt should have sighted
the American ships 10 minutes ago.

991
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:40,080
Sir, all the bombers
are rearmed and ready.

992
01:39:44,769 --> 01:39:48,478
Signal all carriers:
Launch immediately!

993
01:39:56,609 --> 01:40:01,637
There they are, dead ahead.
Sweet mother, look at them!

994
01:40:02,049 --> 01:40:06,884
Huey, the whole Jap navy!
- Pipe down till l report contact!

995
01:40:07,889 --> 01:40:10,608
Raven Leader to Mother Goose:

996
01:40:11,009 --> 01:40:14,319
Have them in sight.
4 enemy carriers.

997
01:40:14,729 --> 01:40:18,722
l say again: 4 enemy carriers.

998
01:40:29,569 --> 01:40:32,447
Helen Leader to Mabel and Bertha!

999
01:40:32,849 --> 01:40:34,840
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!

1000
01:40:36,129 --> 01:40:40,919
This is Helen Leader. We have contact.
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!

1001
01:40:42,849 --> 01:40:46,478
l'm sorry, Commander Leslie,
Torpedo 3 and Fighting 3 don't answer.

1002
01:40:47,529 --> 01:40:50,521
Keep trying. We're supposed to
coordinate our attack.

1003
01:40:50,929 --> 01:40:55,719
Either their navigation is fouled up
or this is the wrong rendezvous point.

1004
01:40:56,129 --> 01:40:57,926
Keep trying, damn it!

1005
01:40:58,329 --> 01:41:00,206
Mabel Leader, come in!

1006
01:41:05,329 --> 01:41:09,004
Raven Leader to flock: They're turning
into the wind, preparing to launch.

1007
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:11,969
l don't see any Jap fighters, Sir.

1008
01:41:12,369 --> 01:41:15,042
Let's not wait for 'em! Fall in!

1009
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:22,807
lt's no use. Commander Massey
and Commander Thach don't answer.

1010
01:41:23,209 --> 01:41:25,359
DK, hang on. We're going in.

1011
01:41:25,849 --> 01:41:30,206
Sir, we don't have a bomb! - We can
draw some heat off the guys that do.

1012
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:35,239
This is Helen Leader. Concentrate
on that big bastard up forward.

1013
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:39,200
Commander McClusky, they've got
bombs all over their flight deck!

1014
01:42:40,169 --> 01:42:41,568
Bull's eye!

1015
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:51,288
Scratch one flattop! Caught him cold!

1016
01:42:51,689 --> 01:42:56,001
Raven Leader to Raven 6.
l got a hit, Commander McClusky.

1017
01:42:56,849 --> 01:42:59,522
Bring it home, girls, bring it home!

1018
01:43:04,209 --> 01:43:06,439
Bull's eye!

1019
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:14,239
Commander, l got a hit!
Look at that bastard burn!

1020
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,078
Beautiful, Helen 3, dead center!

1021
01:43:31,089 --> 01:43:34,877
We caught 'em flat-footed!
No fighters and a deck full of bombs!

1022
01:43:35,289 --> 01:43:37,849
Sweet Mary, how did we get so lucky?

1023
01:44:04,369 --> 01:44:08,328
Helen Leader to squadron:
3 enemy carriers burning.

1024
01:44:08,729 --> 01:44:10,606
Time to go home.

1025
01:44:47,089 --> 01:44:50,240
Admiral, you must transfer your flag.

1026
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:53,083
The cruiser Nagara is close by.

1027
01:44:54,369 --> 01:44:58,157
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi.

1028
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:06,199
l can't tell you where to find the
enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.

1029
01:45:06,609 --> 01:45:10,488
Their last position was radioed
by scout 4 several hours ago.

1030
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:14,677
Hasn't the Soryu scout reported, Sir?
- lt hasn't been heard from.

1031
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:21,164
Then how do l find them, Sir?
- Fly to their last reported position.

1032
01:45:21,569 --> 01:45:25,482
Then just trust your luck
that somehow you will find them.

1033
01:45:37,529 --> 01:45:42,808
Do you hear anything? - Nothing.
All enemy frequencies are silent.

1034
01:45:49,569 --> 01:45:52,447
Lieutenant, enemy planes!
- l see them.

1035
01:45:57,249 --> 01:45:59,205
Dur fighters
are forming for an attack!

1036
01:46:01,489 --> 01:46:05,846
Signal them to lay back with us.
- Lay back ... - Stay off the radio!

1037
01:46:06,249 --> 01:46:09,844
We'll let them
lead us to their carrier.

1038
01:46:19,809 --> 01:46:24,485
l got all Max Leslie's bombers, Sir.
- Where's the rest of Thach's planes?

1039
01:46:24,889 --> 01:46:26,208
Dff the port quarter, Sir.

1040
01:46:33,169 --> 01:46:37,082
l'll bring the fighters down first.
They'll be the lowest on fuel.

1041
01:47:38,489 --> 01:47:40,047
Jesus!

1042
01:47:56,049 --> 01:47:57,926
He's alive, Captain.

1043
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:01,839
Flight Mission Combat!
- Go ahead.

1044
01:48:02,249 --> 01:48:07,448
Radar has more aircraft, bandits.
020 degrees, 30 miles and approaching.

1045
01:48:07,849 --> 01:48:11,888
Roger. Bandits, Sir.
020 degrees, approaching, 30 miles.

1046
01:48:13,849 --> 01:48:14,838
Sound general quarters!

1047
01:49:53,449 --> 01:49:56,885
We took a bomb hit to the side.
The boilers are out.

1048
01:49:58,489 --> 01:50:01,959
Admiral, the radio's down. We can't
send visual signals in this smoke.

1049
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:05,247
You better transfer the flag, Sir.
l suggest to the Astoria.

1050
01:50:05,649 --> 01:50:09,847
Matt, you better stay aboard,
help Murray with the flight ops.

1051
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:14,567
Lower the barge.
- Have the Admiral's barge lowered!

1052
01:50:21,129 --> 01:50:26,157
This is Zephyr calling Whirlwind:
Enemy carrier on fire!

1053
01:50:26,969 --> 01:50:30,803
l repeat: Enemy carrier on fire.
Returning to base.

1054
01:50:31,209 --> 01:50:36,408
That wasn't Kobayashi. - None
of the senior officers survived.

1055
01:50:37,369 --> 01:50:40,805
The scout plane from the Soryu
is approaching. His radio is out.

1056
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:50,239
He's gonna be DK, Captain.
- We'll transfer him in half an hour.

1057
01:51:09,969 --> 01:51:11,607
Hi, Dad.

1058
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:17,329
l'll see you back at Pearl, Tom.

1059
01:51:20,049 --> 01:51:25,726
There's a picture of Haruko and me
that l'd like you to bring ashore.

1060
01:51:27,689 --> 01:51:29,441
l'll take care of it, Tiger.

1061
01:51:35,329 --> 01:51:36,648
Thanks, Dad.

1062
01:51:44,849 --> 01:51:48,444
Dnly 1 boiler in use, Sir. 5 are out.
- Can you get 'em on the line again?

1063
01:51:48,849 --> 01:51:53,320
Yes, Sir. l think l can guarantee
you 15 knots in an hour.

1064
01:51:53,729 --> 01:51:58,484
Very good. Delaney, tell your gang
the topside fires are under control.

1065
01:51:58,889 --> 01:52:00,447
Aye-aye, Sir.

1066
01:52:02,489 --> 01:52:06,243
Matt, we have more planes than pilots.
Can you fly one for me?

1067
01:52:06,649 --> 01:52:07,968
Sure.

1068
01:52:09,049 --> 01:52:11,404
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE

1069
01:52:15,529 --> 01:52:18,760
Did you confirm it?
- Yes, Sir. Fletcher's reply is here.

1070
01:52:19,169 --> 01:52:22,923
''Fletcher to Nimitz: Confirm
1st report, 3 enemy carriers afire.''

1071
01:52:23,329 --> 01:52:24,523
Hallelujah!

1072
01:52:24,929 --> 01:52:30,686
3 of their 1st-line carriers, Admiral!
lsn't that worth a ''hot-diggity-damn''?

1073
01:52:31,089 --> 01:52:35,207
Good advice, Joe, but there's still
that 4th enemy carrier to deal with.

1074
01:52:35,609 --> 01:52:38,999
A message from Captain Buckmaster:
The Yorktown's been hit.

1075
01:52:39,409 --> 01:52:43,402
Badly? - Yes, but she's underway.
- Dperational?

1076
01:52:43,809 --> 01:52:48,803
Dur whole force may be in jeopardy
if the Japanese locate the Yorktown.

1077
01:52:49,209 --> 01:52:51,518
They still have a tremendous fleet.

1078
01:52:51,929 --> 01:52:54,727
But that 4th carrier can't be far off.

1079
01:52:55,929 --> 01:52:59,399
We've already won a great victory,
Admiral.

1080
01:52:59,809 --> 01:53:03,722
Maybe we should get our people back.
- Break off, run for home?

1081
01:53:04,129 --> 01:53:06,518
Before they can hurt us again? Yes.

1082
01:53:10,009 --> 01:53:12,364
That may be the smart play.

1083
01:53:12,769 --> 01:53:16,842
Trouble is: l want that 4th carrier!

1084
01:53:30,729 --> 01:53:33,721
What's wrong?
- Your right wing tank is punctured.

1085
01:53:34,489 --> 01:53:38,482
We haven't had time to repair it.
- ls the left tank fueled? - Yes, Sir.

1086
01:53:39,169 --> 01:53:42,127
A few hours ago
we filled the sky with our planes.

1087
01:53:42,529 --> 01:53:47,683
Now we win or lose
with 6 fighters and 10 torpedo planes.

1088
01:53:55,689 --> 01:53:59,807
The skipper wants to know, can you
maintain this speed? - 18 knots.

1089
01:54:00,209 --> 01:54:04,248
Very good. - All we gotta do
is find that 4th Jap flattop.

1090
01:54:04,649 --> 01:54:06,765
Bridge-phone, Combat.
- Go ahead, Combat.

1091
01:54:07,169 --> 01:54:11,367
Report from Scouting 5.
Adams located the 4th enemy flattop.

1092
01:54:12,449 --> 01:54:14,883
Good. Relay our position to Fletcher.

1093
01:54:15,289 --> 01:54:19,123
We found him, Delaney. Just give us
all the old lady's got left.

1094
01:54:20,649 --> 01:54:23,209
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance: 35 miles, closing.

1095
01:54:23,609 --> 01:54:28,205
They're coming in low.
- Torpedoes! - Sound general quarters!

1096
01:54:28,609 --> 01:54:31,248
Let's get everything airborne
while we still can.

1097
01:54:31,649 --> 01:54:35,164
General quarters!
Man all battle stations!

1098
01:55:52,129 --> 01:55:54,723
Right 4 rudder!
- Aye-aye!

1099
01:56:11,969 --> 01:56:14,722
Watch out! Get down!

1100
01:57:20,609 --> 01:57:25,160
Whirlwind, this is Zephyr 3!
Two torpedoes hit the carrier!

1101
01:57:25,609 --> 01:57:29,397
l repeat: Two torpedoes
hit the carrier! Returning to base.

1102
01:57:29,809 --> 01:57:33,597
Now it's one against one, Admiral.
Congratulations.

1103
01:57:37,409 --> 01:57:39,923
Delaney, what's the situation below?

1104
01:57:40,329 --> 01:57:42,797
No good. All boilers are out.

1105
01:57:43,209 --> 01:57:46,884
Get your people topside, fast!
- Aye-aye, Sir.

1106
01:57:50,609 --> 01:57:54,488
Larry, radio Enterprise:
We'll land there after our bomb run.

1107
01:57:54,889 --> 01:57:58,484
Yes, Sir.
Blue Leader to all planes ...

1108
01:58:01,209 --> 01:58:03,882
How many are we sending out?
- 24 dive-bombers.

1109
01:58:04,289 --> 01:58:07,406
We'll have to try it
without fighter protection.

1110
01:58:07,809 --> 01:58:10,118
What about the Hornet?
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel.

1111
01:58:10,529 --> 01:58:15,967
16 dive-bombers left, and Matt Garth
is bringing 3 from the Yorktown.

1112
01:58:16,369 --> 01:58:20,487
Signal the Hornet:
We attack immediately. - Aye-aye, Sir.

1113
01:59:26,569 --> 01:59:28,958
That wasn't the carrier
Kobayashi dive-bombed.

1114
01:59:29,369 --> 01:59:32,520
She was undamaged.
We put 2 torpedoes into it.

1115
01:59:32,929 --> 01:59:36,808
Kobayashi said the carrier was
on fire. Did you see any smoke?

1116
01:59:37,209 --> 01:59:40,679
No, Sir, it must have sunk.
We didn't see a 3rd carrier, either.

1117
01:59:41,089 --> 01:59:43,603
Dive alert! Enemy dive-bombers!

1118
02:01:00,129 --> 02:01:03,201
Sir, we must withdraw.

1119
02:01:05,409 --> 02:01:08,481
How will we apologize to His Majesty?

1120
02:01:08,889 --> 02:01:10,641
Leave that to me.

1121
02:01:11,049 --> 02:01:17,443
l am the only one
who must apologize to His Majesty.

1122
02:01:32,969 --> 02:01:34,163
Thank you.

1123
02:01:35,449 --> 02:01:38,282
That was the LSD, Sir.
Matt Garth is coming in.

1124
02:01:38,689 --> 02:01:40,566
His plane is all shot up.

1125
02:03:11,929 --> 02:03:15,842
l wonder if Matt knew how big we won.

1126
02:03:16,249 --> 02:03:18,524
l think l know what he'd have said:

1127
02:03:20,169 --> 02:03:23,047
''lt doesn't make any sense, Admiral.

1128
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:25,121
Yamamoto had everything going for him,

1129
02:03:25,529 --> 02:03:28,999
power, experience, confidence ...

1130
02:03:30,409 --> 02:03:35,403
Were we better than the Japanese,
or just luckier?''
