1
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,224
Jesus!

2
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,560
Cease fire! Cease fire!

3
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,020
You sons of bitches!

4
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:46,731
- You almost blew my head off!
- Sorry, Beckett.

5
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:49,233
- What's wrong with you?
- I saw something.

6
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,568
I thought I saw it too.

7
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:53,820
Christ, man.

8
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:57,365
You thought you saw something?

9
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,951
I saw a deer, maybe.

10
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,577
A deer, maybe.

11
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:06,539
Do I look like a fucking deer
to you, asswipe?

12
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:22,886
- Where are they?
- Probably lost. No, they are lost.

13
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,805
- I've gotta find them.
- Shouldn't be too difficult...

14
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,808
...you being the great white hunter
and all.

15
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:33,436
- You can't just leave like this.
- Watch me.

16
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:36,939
They'll want refunds.
It's coming out of your check.

17
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,358
Fine. I'm tired of dealing
with assholes...

18
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:43,153
- ...paying to shoot caged animals.
- Not sporting enough for you?

19
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,739
I suppose the people you picked off
had a better chance?

20
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:50,200
Every man I killed could as easily
have killed me.

21
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,737
Military Intelligence.

22
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,030
- Thomas Beckett?
- Do I know you?

23
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:29,575
I'm Colonel Dan McKenna.
This is James Eckles. He's with-

24
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,368
CIA?

25
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:32,953
How'd you know?

26
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:36,080
I don't know. You just
kind of got that look.

27
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,124
Do you have a minute for us?

28
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,042
Sorry.

29
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:44,963
Boy, you've bounced around
a bit since your discharge.

30
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,756
Had trouble holding a job...

31
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:50,634
Trouble holding a relationship,
trouble sleeping past 6 a. m.

32
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:53,261
Trouble adjusting.
Trouble with my pension-

33
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:56,055
- Mr. Beckett.
- Sir.

34
00:05:56,222 --> 00:06:00,976
I understand your difficulties, and I'm
sorry. But that's not why we're here.

35
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,229
You won the Kodiak marksmanship
tournament last month.

36
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:07,523
You beat the Marine Corps team
and seven SWAT members.

37
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:10,192
So? What are you,
the awards committee?

38
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:13,445
- No. We need a sniper, a good one.
- The best.

39
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:21,576
Didn't my dossier happen to mention
my medical discharge, unfit for duty...?

40
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:24,412
Apparently they made a mistake.

41
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,002
How is it your proposition entails hiring
a 50-year-old former scout sniper?

42
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,753
Can we talk about this?

43
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:38,799
Everyone figures the Balkans are clean
since we took Milosevic down.

44
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:42,761
But there are others like him
waiting for us to turn our backs.

45
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,556
Our Intelligence has tracked resistance
in what NATO calls "no man's land."

46
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,602
They're led by a rogue general
named Mulik Valstoria.

47
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:58,274
He's commander of what he likes
to call the "23rd Home Guard."

48
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:01,652
Look, this guy is running
a stealth operation...

49
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:05,446
...of ethnic cleansing
in Muslim towns along the border.

50
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:09,950
We're removing the general before
it escalates into something bigger.

51
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:13,203
Well, why me?

52
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,498
Why not Heister or Baker?
Those jarheads are still doing tours.

53
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:21,376
- This one's off the books.
- You've got an impressive career.

54
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,796
Former record holder on the long shot,
1.1 miles.

55
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,882
Baker broke it. Hit an al Qaeda
guard at 1.24 miles.

56
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:31,051
No, the record's 1.47.

57
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,386
A Cuban general
near Guantanamo Bay.

58
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:36,639
A Cuban general hit a man
at a mile and a half?

59
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:40,350
I killed a Cuban general
at a mile and a half.

60
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:44,771
- That's the record, for the record.
- Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you.

61
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,315
- This is gonna be tough.
- You mean suicide.

62
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:51,026
There's a group of separatists
in Gilau that'll help you.

63
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:54,446
I used to do this because
I was following orders...

64
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:56,114
...but what's in it for me?

65
00:07:56,322 --> 00:08:01,076
The risk is great. We're authorized
to offer you anything you like.

66
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:04,079
- Anything?
- Anything.

67
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:06,914
Look here.

68
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:10,459
If you're willing
to offer me anything...

69
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:15,088
...then I have to assume
that you don't plan to pay off.

70
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,882
You've already chalked me up
for dead.

71
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,345
Yeah.

72
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,305
But then I look around here,
and...

73
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,350
So you'll do it?

74
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:35,980
You know, whenever I do die,
I want it to be as a Marine.

75
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,607
So, what I want
is my former rank back.

76
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:43,111
I wouldn't expect you to understand
that, but I know you do, sir.

77
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,321
So do we have a deal?

78
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:49,158
Yes, we do,
master gunnery sergeant.

79
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,119
Roger that, sir.

80
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:55,079
All right...

81
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:59,500
A mission like this into hostile territory,
gotta be a two-man operation.

82
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:04,170
So, what I want
is a good observer.

83
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:10,050
AMERICAN EMBASSY BERLIN
10:05

84
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,096
Colonel McKenna.

85
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,808
Good. Send him in.

86
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,978
He's here. They brought him
straight from the plane.

87
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:27,440
How is a man in the joint for killing
a federal officer suddenly cut loose?

88
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:29,483
It's not easy, believe me.

89
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,486
It seems to me he'll stick out
like a sore thumb.

90
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:35,863
Come in.

91
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:41,660
Reporting with Mr. Cole
as ordered, sir.

92
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,161
Thank you, gunny.

93
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:54,004
Sit down, Mr. Cole.

94
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,723
Freedom.

95
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,976
- Shall I refresh your memory?
- I don't need no refreshing.

96
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,352
One mission.

97
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,982
If I fail or try to escape or even
take a shit where you say I can’t...

98
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,692
...it's back to death row, right?

99
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:25,113
Master Gunnery Sergeant Beckett...

100
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,365
...meet Jake Cole.

101
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:30,993
I don't think he likes me.

102
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,578
Must be that Army thing.

103
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:35,205
No.

104
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:41,084
Colonel, Mr. Eckles, may I have a word
with this man in private?

105
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,545
By all means,
master gunnery sergeant.

106
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,185
Says here you speak the lingo
where we're going.

107
00:11:03,937 --> 00:11:07,648
Enough to keep your sorry old ass
out of trouble.

108
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:15,530
- And you were an Army sniper?
- Former Delta, 85-41 out of Quantico.

109
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,157
Urban sniper, SOTG.

110
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,409
Seven real-world missions.

111
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:23,745
Four as an observer,
three as a shooter.

112
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:26,247
Three confirmed.

113
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,166
Couple questions, sergeant.

114
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,836
We're at 750 yards
at a 19-degree angle.

115
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,672
What's the difference between
the points of aim and impact?

116
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:39,258
- Well, how tall's the target, man?
- Five feet, 10 inches.

117
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:44,888
23.17 inches high.

118
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:48,307
And you'll need to dial six
up three.

119
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,645
And when your time comes,
what will you say?

120
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:59,983
I ain't gonna say nothing.
I'll just shut up and die like a soldier.

121
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:07,573
Roger. Verify touchdown of Snake Eater
at ballpark at 1500. Over.

122
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,075
Roger. Touchdown Snake Eater.

123
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:12,911
Big Eye verifying ballpark
is clear. Over.

124
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,788
Roger. I copy. Out.

125
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,416
You ever try using one of these?

126
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,920
No. Still use a compass.

127
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:26,422
Just old-school, I guess.

128
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,718
Rendezvous points, radio freqs
as per S.O.P.

129
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,305
Two minutes out.
Initiating approach.

130
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,056
Roger that.

131
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:41,518
Once again, we drop in here,
seven clicks from Gilau.

132
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:44,229
At St. Stephan's church,
we meet our contact.

133
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,940
The partisans will provide us
with weapons and photos.

134
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,818
It's too bad it's not the Basilica.
I'd like to see that.

135
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,779
- Say again?
- The Basilica of Gilau.

136
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:59,033
It's one of the most beautiful
Byzantine churches in Eastern Europe.

137
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,620
I spent a lot of time reading
travel books and shit in prison.

138
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:08,541
I must have read every AAA Guide
and National Geographic ever printed.

139
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,167
Why?

140
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,836
To keep the dream alive.

141
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:15,797
It's pretty easy to let them break you
in the house.

142
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:20,300
Most guys on the row are actually
looking forward to the day they die.

143
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,013
We're here to put a bullet
in a man and let God sort it out.

144
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,557
You better just pray we get
out of this country alive.

145
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,935
All your dream shit... stops here.

146
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,604
30 seconds to drop.

147
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,147
Roger.

148
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:30,609
Aviano AFB, Sicily

149
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:32,819
Snake Eater,
specify transmission. Over.

150
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:36,781
- Getting a lot of interference.
- Home run. Snake Eater out.

151
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:39,158
- Any problems?
- Negative.

152
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:45,580
They should make contact at 1630.

153
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,450
Remove your cover.

154
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,096
I am the one you are looking for.

155
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,642
She's our contact.
Goddamn!

156
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,060
Get on your knees, son...

157
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:05,605
...while I pray for your soul.

158
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:11,109
My name is Sophia.

159
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:15,571
We were expecting someone...
older.

160
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:19,575
Not many people grow old
in this business.

161
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:24,454
Did you bring our package?

162
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,589
The photo of Valstoria
is only a few days old.

163
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:41,510
The others are of the buildings
around the Ministry of Defense.

164
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:46,722
The one with the corner window
is very high and close.

165
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:56,898
A clear shot.

166
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:04,362
I think maybe that is where
you want to be.

167
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,408
I'll decide that.

168
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,294
It's nearly 300 meters away.

169
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:24,838
Maybe it's too far.

170
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:28,924
- Three hundred and twenty-six yards.
- I agree with her.

171
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,760
We should be closer to the action.

172
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,554
You just call it,
I'll hit it.

173
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,391
Valstoria arrives at the ministry
every other morning, 7:30 exactly.

174
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,101
He will walk up the steps.

175
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,104
It's six meters
from the car to the building.

176
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:49,149
- And he's 184 centimeters tall?
- Yes.

177
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,235
I'll need a guitar case.

178
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:03,328
As you can see, the streets in this part
of the city are very narrow and old.

179
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:06,372
It will not be easy to escape.

180
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:18,215
Sergeant Beckett's rifle
was our one priority.

181
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,051
That's the best we have
with our limitations.

182
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,678
No, it'll do just fine.

183
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:28,307
I must leave to make sure
everything is arranged.

184
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:32,477
The city will be in chaos.
You need to get to the church.

185
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,813
It's built on top of Roman catacombs.

186
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:36,898
We can move beneath the city.

187
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:39,108
We'll get to the church on time.

188
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,777
You just make sure you're there.

189
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:47,114
What he means is, thank you.

190
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,784
Okay.

191
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,835
That Sophia...

192
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,796
- Not what I expected.
- Stay in the bubble.

193
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:08,466
If the diversion device works,
we've got five minutes.

194
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:12,177
I want you shadowing me.
No sightseeing. Understood?

195
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:17,098
- Roger that.
- Get your gear together. Let's go.

196
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:23,603
Three hundred and twenty-eight yards.
Give me three up one.

197
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,898
I've got wind coming
from the right at four to six.

198
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:31,026
Of course, that could change
in the morning. East is at our backs.

199
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,445
Sunrise is at 0637.

200
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:37,865
We could have some shadows on
the target from the buildings at 0730.

201
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,951
Rig the diversion device.
Let's get out of here.

202
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:45,246
- Where do we take the shot from?
- From the window she suggested.

203
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,790
It is the perfect position.

204
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,906
Catch any Z's?

205
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:31,076
- No.
- All right.

206
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:36,122
And who are you, my friend?

207
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:41,210
Two hundred and eighteen yards.
Give me two up one.

208
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,341
Full-value wind is one to three.
Give me a half left.

209
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:05,063
- I got a five-degree angle.
- Don't worry about that.

210
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,565
It's not enough of an angle.

211
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:17,990
You never asked me why I did it.

212
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:22,452
- Did what?
- Why I killed that motherfucker.

213
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:24,913
Well, I don't condone it.

214
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,873
I just don't care enough about you
to want to know.

215
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:35,588
You got a real way about you,
don't you, master guns?

216
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,095
They're here.

217
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,557
Black Mercedes with escorts.

218
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,435
Right on schedule.

219
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,906
Bastard doesn't know
he's got less than a minute.

220
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,283
If he moves,
give me half a mil lead.

221
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,617
Roger.

222
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:14,329
- Wind?
- Same.

223
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:26,297
- Target's out and moving.
- Ready.

224
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:30,467
Diversion's set.
Head shot. Fire.

225
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:36,014
What's up?

226
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,726
- Nothing. Ready.
- Are you sure?

227
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:45,313
Just keep your eye on the scope
and shut the fuck up.

228
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:48,732
Okay.

229
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:49,900
Center chest.

230
00:22:52,569 --> 00:22:53,570
Fire!

231
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,785
Target's down.

232
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:03,995
Shit.

233
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,385
Shit, they made us.

234
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:31,018
There is no goddamn way
they can see us up here.

235
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:37,315
There! There he is!

236
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:41,693
All right, let's break down the hide
and didi out of here.

237
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,571
Four blocks, we reach the church.

238
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:47,573
- We should split up.
- Negative.

239
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,867
Keep your sidearm in your hand.

240
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:52,619
They're looking for two men.
Maybe separate-

241
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:56,664
They'll be looking at everyone.
Stick together, we cover each other.

242
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,799
Three more blocks.

243
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:55,088
- What?
- Change of plans.

244
00:26:18,532 --> 00:26:20,075
Who was the last to get on?

245
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,160
The gentleman and two others.

246
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,131
Your identification, please.

247
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:39,216
Sure.

248
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:47,056
Cover him.

249
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:48,808
On the floor!

250
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,136
We've got company!

251
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:37,473
Coming up fast!

252
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,224
Left! Left!

253
00:28:49,867 --> 00:28:51,451
Cole!
What are you doing?

254
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:55,455
Get out of the street!

255
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,353
You dumb son of a bitch.

256
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:42,786
Beckett didn't make it
to the extraction point.

257
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,457
- Was he captured?
- Negative.

258
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:51,585
Our people report
only Cole in custody.

259
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:56,172
Is Beckett dead?

260
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:01,927
It doesn't really matter.
Op's still on track.

261
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,272
Where are the others?

262
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,528
You're not alone.

263
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:28,282
No one takes a shot like that alone.

264
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:38,249
So who is with you?

265
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:47,256
I don't know
what you're talking about.

266
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:06,147
So you think...

267
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:08,816
...being in here is...

268
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:10,442
...funny.

269
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,652
Not really.

270
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,988
United Nations?

271
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,698
Americans?

272
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:19,199
British?

273
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:21,285
Russian?

274
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:23,787
Do I look Russian to you?

275
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:25,830
Get him out of here.

276
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:38,424
What are you doing?
You shouldn't have come here.

277
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:40,843
We ran into a problem.

278
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:43,345
Come in.

279
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:56,856
You should have gone to the church.

280
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,734
- They took your partner.
- Is he still alive?

281
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,444
Yes.

282
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:05,738
On TV, they say his capture
will prove to the world...

283
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:09,658
...that we are the victims
of United Nations atrocities.

284
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:12,911
Where are they holding him?

285
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:16,164
Sponza prison.

286
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,708
I've never heard of that.

287
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:23,420
No one has,
not in your world.

288
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:28,549
It's a secret place where Valstoria's
men imprison their special enemies.

289
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:32,177
We have to figure a way
to get him out.

290
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:34,929
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

291
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,397
Is there something
you're not telling me?

292
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:51,109
Of course not.

293
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:55,780
Let me talk to some people.

294
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:58,282
Maybe there's a way.

295
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:22,427
Pavel.

296
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:28,224
He's waking up!
The American is waking up!

297
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:31,059
Pavel!

298
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:41,526
Leave the man alone.
Let him have some rest.

299
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,822
Is it true what they say?
He killed Valstoria?

300
00:33:50,284 --> 00:33:52,369
I think it is foolhardy to move him now.

301
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:56,205
We run a great risk of taking him
into the open.

302
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:57,873
What you think is not important.

303
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,834
They have started to advance
in the North and West.

304
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:07,381
We have no proof
they know about this place.

305
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,300
We're making a huge mistake!

306
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,844
The mistake was yours when
you let them kill Valstoria.

307
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:17,265
Now we must seek the protection
of our allies to the East.

308
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,433
The decision has been made...

309
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,978
Don't say anything.
Just nod occasionally.

310
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:37,782
What did you say?

311
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:41,576
That if you got drunk again tonight
and were a bad lover...

312
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:43,578
...I was going to leave you.

313
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:29,074
All these arms
are from World War ll.

314
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:30,409
Some of it, yes.

315
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:33,203
What are they doing here?

316
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:35,622
My grandfather fought the Germans.

317
00:35:35,788 --> 00:35:40,375
My father, against the Communists.
Now it's our turn.

318
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:54,012
Mauser 792.

319
00:35:56,222 --> 00:36:00,100
It's an antique, but one of the
finest weapons the Germans made.

320
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,019
Yes.

321
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:06,606
I guess it'll do.

322
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,275
Cole's in.

323
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:13,445
The hit on Valstoria's got them
running scared, as planned.

324
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:17,114
They should move
our primary target soon.

325
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:20,951
- How do we know Cole made contact?
- We don’t.

326
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:25,580
All right. Let's finish this.

327
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,376
Will this do?

328
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:34,087
- I think it'll do.
- Sophia!

329
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,924
It's okay. These are my brothers,
Vojislav and Zoran.

330
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,051
This is Sergeant Beckett.

331
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:45,596
The American who crashes streetcars?

332
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:47,848
He should not be here.
He is not part of the plan.

333
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,767
His presence could jeopardize
Pavel's escape.

334
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:51,810
Well he is here!
We have no choice now!

335
00:36:51,935 --> 00:36:53,895
Say again in English.

336
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:58,024
There is great concern
over Valstoria's killing.

337
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,402
The American prisoner and several
others will be moved to Pozarevac.

338
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:04,863
Pozarevac is a fortress,
impenetrable.

339
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:07,281
Once they take him,
he'll be executed.

340
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:11,243
Okay. Get me five men,
your best shooters...

341
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,203
...and I'll need a map...

342
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:15,455
What's so funny?

343
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:20,042
There is no one to help you
except us.

344
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,086
Yes.

345
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:28,924
You people
are the entire underground?

346
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:34,512
We're the only ones left, no?

347
00:37:35,138 --> 00:37:36,889
Yes.

348
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:38,974
Okay.

349
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:41,518
Get me your best shooter.

350
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,981
It's me.

351
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:52,069
Hurrah.

352
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:55,738
Get out! Come on, move!

353
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,043
You're Pavel, right?

354
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,757
When the time comes,
just do as I say.

355
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,217
You two over there.

356
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:09,808
I don't know what happened.
It just stopped...

357
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:10,851
Get that piece of shit out of the way.

358
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,983
He's in the other truck.

359
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,536
C’mon already! C’mon, move!

360
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:39,258
Weapon!

361
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,693
Who the hell is he?

362
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:04,029
That's classified.

363
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:06,948
Classified, my ass.
Get rid of him.

364
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:09,950
- Calm down, Beckett.
- No! We're on a mission.

365
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:12,202
We're not here to make new friends.

366
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,120
Your mission is over.

367
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,497
It ended when you killed Valstoria.

368
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:17,832
This man is mine.

369
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:21,084
- What do you mean, yours?
- My mission:

370
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,295
Get captured, find this man...

371
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:25,797
...and bring him out of the country.

372
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:31,134
Your mission was
just a setup for mine.

373
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:40,350
Are you all in this together?

374
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,859
Don't act like this is the first time...

375
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,737
...the government's ever
fucked you over.

376
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,573
You made it out.
Why'd you come back?

377
00:42:57,698 --> 00:42:59,617
I had my reasons.

378
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:02,953
Yeah, well, I wouldn’t
have done the same for you.

379
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:05,997
I guess this is a conversation
for another time.

380
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:10,626
Whatever your reasons,
my friend, I'm grateful.

381
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:17,381
Satellite uplink beginning in three.

382
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,550
- Colonel?
- Yeah?

383
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:22,928
This is a feed from Atlanta.
CNN's on the scene.

384
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:24,971
Some kind of terrorist attack.

385
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:27,223
What do we know?

386
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:32,394
Four military vehicles,
one transport...

387
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:35,647
- ...seven, maybe eight bodies.
- Ours?

388
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:37,148
No. Soldiers.

389
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:40,442
Scramble a chopper.
We got an evac in three hours.

390
00:43:57,206 --> 00:43:59,833
- What was this place?
- An old ironworks.

391
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,711
The government brought
Muslims here to work...

392
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:04,462
...and then killed them.

393
00:44:04,629 --> 00:44:07,715
Generals and majors,
fools and idiots.

394
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,883
What is it?
What's the matter?

395
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,718
- How much longer?
-10 minutes.

396
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:14,804
A long time in your world
of precious seconds.

397
00:44:14,971 --> 00:44:16,597
Yeah, too long.

398
00:44:16,764 --> 00:44:18,808
There's a rooftop extraction.

399
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,517
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely.

400
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,174
Where to now?

401
00:44:58,382 --> 00:45:00,551
The sewers will take us to the river.

402
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,850
They're sure interested
in getting you back.

403
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:11,184
What did you do?

404
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:13,436
I'm a writer.
I challenge authority.

405
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:16,272
They put me away
but they can't contain truth.

406
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:17,565
They can kill you.

407
00:45:17,732 --> 00:45:21,568
I die, my words become more
powerful. They want me alive.

408
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:23,445
- I'm going back up.
- Me too.

409
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:25,238
No. You lead them out.

410
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:28,240
That's crazy, man.
You can't help him now.

411
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:31,368
Maybe not, but I can
slow them down for you.

412
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:33,703
- That's suicide, man.
- I don't care.

413
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,290
Dr. Pavel is my country.
If I die, don't make it in vain.

414
00:45:43,336 --> 00:45:45,755
Okay, this way.

415
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:05,021
Though our nations are different,
you have our...

416
00:46:05,188 --> 00:46:06,814
What is it?

417
00:46:07,106 --> 00:46:09,191
Your condolences
are appreciated...

418
00:46:09,441 --> 00:46:11,360
...but your help is unnecessary...

419
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:14,779
...unless you can name the
Americans responsible.

420
00:46:14,946 --> 00:46:16,280
What are you saying?

421
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:19,575
They've taken something
very important from us.

422
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,285
Something we want back.

423
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:23,536
They will be placed on trial...

424
00:46:23,703 --> 00:46:26,372
...and their executions
televised worldwide.

425
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:28,582
I know American people's passions.

426
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:33,211
What will they say when their sons
are hanging from the end of a rope?

427
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:49,975
Come on.

428
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,167
What in the hell was that?

429
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:23,169
One of our birds picked it up
about an hour ago.

430
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:27,632
A call from Leskovic, who says he’s
head of the NNB, whatever that is.

431
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:28,799
The other voice?

432
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:32,344
An aide who took the call from
our Romanian ambassador.

433
00:47:32,511 --> 00:47:34,721
- Does the White House know?
- Not yet.

434
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:38,182
- They will not be happy.
- There's always a price to pay.

435
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:59,199
What's up?

436
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:06,039
Shoot him and you let
everybody know where we are.

437
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:12,878
Okay.

438
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:29,183
We can go to Komra.
It's a Muslim village.

439
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,810
My friend Nauzad is there to help us.

440
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:35,396
All right, wait a minute.
How far is this Komra?

441
00:48:35,563 --> 00:48:37,356
Maybe 10 kilometers.

442
00:48:37,607 --> 00:48:41,943
If we leave now, we can be there
before the sun rises.

443
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:46,572
All right.

444
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:48,908
It's time she goes.

445
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:51,576
No.

446
00:48:53,078 --> 00:48:56,289
Look, I'm not gonna play
fuck-fuck games with you.

447
00:48:56,622 --> 00:48:58,040
She goes...

448
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,043
...and you live
to fight another day.

449
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,003
He's right.

450
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:07,298
Take care of yourself, Mr. Cole.

451
00:49:15,346 --> 00:49:17,265
Goodbye.

452
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:22,394
Yeah. Good...

453
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,704
Got a light on upstairs.

454
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:46,706
Got it.

455
00:49:46,873 --> 00:49:49,416
How well did you say
you know this guy?

456
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,918
Nauzad and I are old friends.

457
00:49:52,085 --> 00:49:54,045
The kind you trust.

458
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:02,052
- Nauzad.
- Pavel.

459
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:15,063
These must be the Americans
we've heard much about.

460
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,106
The television reports them as killed.

461
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:19,233
Sorry to disappoint.

462
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:22,319
You should know better than to believe
what the television tells you.

463
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,613
- Want to say again in English?
- Of course.

464
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,824
We need some help, Nauzad.

465
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,411
- We need to get to the...
- Border.

466
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:41,460
There is a bus from the village
that travels to Krizevci.

467
00:50:41,627 --> 00:50:44,129
From there,
the border's a few kilometers.

468
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:47,048
I will drive you to the bus.

469
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,300
Thank you.

470
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:53,136
Stay here. I'll get my brother's van.
Here are beds, a shower.

471
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:55,555
If you're hungry, I'll make something.

472
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,139
We can manage.

473
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,391
You go.

474
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,696
Any updates?

475
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:19,283
Not for an hour.

476
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:23,620
What's their secondary?

477
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,371
Simand.

478
00:51:25,538 --> 00:51:28,040
I suggest we consider an abort.

479
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:30,084
Start working on a cover story.

480
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:32,210
No, not yet.

481
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:36,047
Those are American soldiers.
We're not gonna abort.

482
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:49,225
I still don't trust old Nauzad.
How about you?

483
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:53,937
I don't trust anybody.
That's why I'm still alive.

484
00:51:57,273 --> 00:51:59,775
Look, I still don't know
why you did it...

485
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:02,736
...but I owe you
for coming back for me.

486
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:06,447
You don't owe me shit.
Just leave me the fuck alone.

487
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:09,408
What, are you still pissed?

488
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,119
I had nothing to do
with their decision.

489
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:14,996
The important thing
is to finish the mission.

490
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:18,749
The mission? Mission?

491
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:24,087
You mean remission.

492
00:52:24,212 --> 00:52:26,923
- What?
- Remission of sin.

493
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:29,758
- That's what this is.
- What are you saying?

494
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:32,552
That's what the spooks call it.

495
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,973
You kill someone,
you make an act of contrition.

496
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:41,393
In this case, that would be
your buddy Pavel.

497
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,438
Penance, and it doesn't matter
whether he lives or dies.

498
00:52:45,605 --> 00:52:49,900
The debt's paid and everybody
walks away with a clean conscience.

499
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:51,985
- That's bullshit.
- Bullshit?

500
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,487
That's the nature of political killing.

501
00:52:54,654 --> 00:52:58,074
Why do you think they picked us?
Some kid on death row...

502
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,868
...a beat-up, four-fingered
sniper whose eyes are going...

503
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:05,913
...and it doesn't matter if Pavel
makes it or we die trying...

504
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,457
...because it's a great story
for CNN...

505
00:53:08,624 --> 00:53:12,544
...and they'll play it over
and over, 24 hours a day.

506
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:15,088
In the end they'll forgive and forget...

507
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:17,882
...there was some bad fucker
named Valstoria...

508
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:21,468
...that took a bullet in the chest
in the name of freedom.

509
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,235
Hey.

510
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:46,114
I'm not pissed off at you, son.

511
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,491
I'm mad at myself.

512
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,743
I should have seen this coming.

513
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:54,245
I guess it's age.

514
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:04,004
Well, how about that,
master guns?

515
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,006
You and me sharing
a moment together.

516
00:54:07,173 --> 00:54:09,133
Who knows?

517
00:54:09,717 --> 00:54:14,596
If we weren't doing this,
we might even be friends.

518
00:54:17,556 --> 00:54:19,642
Friends...

519
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:50,626
Say, Beckett, how long
were you in the service?

520
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:57,340
Twenty-six years.

521
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:02,469
You ever think about
doing anything else?

522
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:08,265
Yeah. Yeah, I went to
school to be an engineer...

523
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:11,101
...but I didn't have the head for it.

524
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:13,770
So then I worked on
a ranch in Montana.

525
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:16,439
It didn't work out,
so I joined the Marines...

526
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:19,400
...picked up a gun and guess what?
I was good.

527
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,652
From the shots I've seen,
you're better than good.

528
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,738
Being a Marine is the one thing
I've done well.

529
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,574
Is that something to be proud of?

530
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:32,702
Being the best at killing
another human being?

531
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:38,416
I kill people so that others can live.

532
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:41,043
Like you, for instance.

533
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:44,170
There are other ways
to achieve peace...

534
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:47,173
...other than through force.
Diplomatic ways.

535
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:49,049
Oh, yeah, the diplomats.

536
00:55:49,216 --> 00:55:52,260
Without the diplomats,
you wouldn't need soldiers.

537
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:55,596
We unscrew the problems
that diplomats make.

538
00:55:55,763 --> 00:56:01,018
We have the same goal,
you and me. A world free of hate.

539
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:03,436
I just hope to get there without blood.

540
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,647
If you haven't figured it out,
freedom isn't free.

541
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:10,275
You realize McKenna
probably thinks we're dead.

542
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,486
Yeah, I guess so.

543
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:16,781
He's gonna shit when he
sees me walk in with Pavel.

544
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:20,034
How can there be traffic
in the middle of nowhere?

545
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:29,833
Nauzad.

546
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,253
He would die before
he told them anything.

547
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,198
Open up!

548
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:12,369
Where are they?

549
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:34,012
I think they are still
heading for the border.

550
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:36,973
Unless there is another extraction point.

551
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,227
Take your men and check Simand.

552
00:57:43,687 --> 00:57:44,562
Understood.

553
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:46,064
Move out.

554
00:57:47,857 --> 00:57:49,483
How far do we have to go?

555
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:52,152
Maybe two or three hours.

556
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,888
Just got word from Langley.

557
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:32,936
He's with Cole and Pavel.

558
00:58:34,229 --> 00:58:36,147
Why does this not surprise me?

559
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:40,484
Also reports of heavy military activity
near the border at Simand.

560
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:42,402
They're coming home.

561
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:43,945
Scramble a chopper.

562
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:53,245
Pavel?

563
00:58:53,995 --> 00:58:55,622
Yes?

564
00:58:55,788 --> 00:58:58,457
I want you to think hard...

565
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,049
...and tell me the truth.

566
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,220
When you were alone with Nauzad...

567
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,806
...did you happen to mention Simand?

568
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,018
No.

569
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:28,065
Good.

570
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,491
It's a fucking ghost town.

571
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:42,744
Muslims lived around
here for 600 years.

572
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:45,121
The Nazis tried to wipe them out...

573
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:47,498
...then the Communists
and the Serbs.

574
00:59:47,623 --> 00:59:50,167
They were called the modrus.

575
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:53,128
It means " invincible."

576
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:55,838
- Why do this to them?
- Language...

577
00:59:56,714 --> 00:59:58,340
...religion...

578
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:01,009
...property, greed...

579
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:02,803
You choose.

580
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,599
Men kill other men...

581
01:00:08,724 --> 01:00:10,851
...and nobody knows why.

582
01:00:11,393 --> 01:00:13,520
I don't care what he says.

583
01:00:13,728 --> 01:00:16,397
If I see something moving,
I'm shooting it.

584
01:00:21,193 --> 01:00:24,320
Verifying touchdown
of Snake Eater at LZ. Over.

585
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:29,241
Roger touchdown, Snake Eater.
LZ is clear at this time. Over.

586
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:43,295
There has been a report of an unidentified
helicopter headed towards Simand.

587
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:44,504
We're on our way.

588
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:47,006
Understood.

589
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:11,151
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

590
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:19,908
My men are in position.

591
01:01:20,826 --> 01:01:22,160
Good. All right.

592
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,001
What is it?

593
01:02:21,168 --> 01:02:24,712
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

594
01:02:25,505 --> 01:02:28,007
I don't see anything, but...

595
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,221
You like to hunt, master guns?

596
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:39,433
As a kid.
I don't much care for it now.

597
01:02:39,725 --> 01:02:42,352
Cole, I've got movement.

598
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,824
Get up. Come on.

599
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:11,001
How is he?

600
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,964
Flesh wound, upper arm.
He'll be okay.

601
01:03:27,265 --> 01:03:28,933
Stay.

602
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:06,347
They're definitely not
conventional infantry.

603
01:05:06,514 --> 01:05:08,891
Roger that. You okay?

604
01:05:09,058 --> 01:05:12,894
- Yeah, but they're crawling over us.
- Let's move out into town.

605
01:05:13,061 --> 01:05:14,979
That town's gotta be hot.

606
01:05:18,691 --> 01:05:21,985
You look here. We got 30 minutes
to our rendezvous.

607
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,821
Now, you either go with me
or without me.

608
01:05:30,868 --> 01:05:32,953
Shit.

609
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:46,055
You ever seen
anything like this before?

610
01:06:46,806 --> 01:06:49,558
Yeah, Lebanon...

611
01:06:50,184 --> 01:06:53,895
...when the Hezbollah took out
the Marine barracks in Beirut.

612
01:06:54,062 --> 01:06:57,940
And then Nam.
Hue City, Tet Offensive.

613
01:06:58,107 --> 01:07:01,068
Three weeks of sleep deprivation,
endless rain...

614
01:07:01,193 --> 01:07:04,029
...endless death.
Just shit.

615
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:09,575
That ought to be on the recruiting
poster. "Join the Marines.

616
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:11,451
Travel the world.

617
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,412
Make new friends and kill them."

618
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:18,124
You look at this shit:
buildings down, people dead.

619
01:07:18,332 --> 01:07:21,293
You gotta draw the line somewhere.

620
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:23,962
So does that make us
the good guys?

621
01:07:24,129 --> 01:07:26,714
There are no good guys
in a war.

622
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:29,800
Knock off that shit.
We're going down there.

623
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:32,761
- Move out.
- Not the shitholes again. Goddamn.

624
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,235
All right, this way.

625
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,785
Anybody know what day it is
in the real world?

626
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:03,787
Wednesday?

627
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,498
I'm supposed to die on a Wednesday.

628
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,627
The first thing I'll do
when I get home...

629
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:15,922
...is take a shower, and get laid.

630
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:18,466
Not necessarily in that order.

631
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,240
Think that was just some shit
somebody left behind?

632
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:50,325
I don't know.

633
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:55,413
Claymore!

634
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:31,652
Goddamn it, my ears.

635
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:34,863
- They're gonna bury us down here.
- Negative.

636
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:38,365
I put us somewhere just
outside the rendezvous point.

637
01:09:38,532 --> 01:09:41,451
You take Pavel. You get up top.

638
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,620
I'll provide cover for extraction.

639
01:09:43,828 --> 01:09:46,956
- That's suicide.
- I've said that since the beginning.

640
01:09:47,123 --> 01:09:50,209
Now, don't fight me on this, son.
Just do it.

641
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:58,090
Roger that, master guns.

642
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:02,219
Cole. Com-techs.

643
01:11:14,487 --> 01:11:15,822
Cole, good to go?

644
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:18,449
Clear.

645
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,383
There's only one shooter, middle
of the block, southeast corner.

646
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,928
- Got you. Inside the church.
- No.

647
01:12:33,094 --> 01:12:34,971
Negative.

648
01:12:35,638 --> 01:12:37,098
I want you to stand by.

649
01:12:37,265 --> 01:12:39,642
You're here to protect the package.

650
01:12:42,602 --> 01:12:46,230
What did you mean, you were
going to die on a Wednesday?

651
01:12:47,064 --> 01:12:49,983
I was sentenced to death
for killing a man.

652
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:59,325
I went through selection
with three other guys.

653
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:01,243
We were like brothers.

654
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,829
Called ourselves the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

655
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:13,878
Couple of years back, we went
into Rostock to help the DEA...

656
01:13:14,045 --> 01:13:17,381
...take out some big-time
Russian heroin drug lords.

657
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,800
Two separate missions.

658
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:24,888
We got ours, but their
mission was compromised.

659
01:13:25,305 --> 01:13:27,056
My guys...

660
01:13:28,974 --> 01:13:31,476
...left their heads in an alley.

661
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:38,649
So who's this man you killed?

662
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:42,652
The DEA who betrayed us.

663
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:47,865
I can't prove that he did it,
but I know it was him.

664
01:13:48,074 --> 01:13:50,367
- Which one were you?
- What?

665
01:13:50,534 --> 01:13:52,536
Which horseman?

666
01:13:53,203 --> 01:13:55,205
The fourth one, I guess.

667
01:13:55,371 --> 01:13:57,039
"And his name was Death...

668
01:13:57,206 --> 01:13:59,833
...and hell followed with him."

669
01:14:00,584 --> 01:14:05,129
"People sleep peacefully
in their beds at night...

670
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,676
...only because men stand ready
to do violence on their behalf."

671
01:14:12,302 --> 01:14:14,387
- You write that?
- No.

672
01:14:14,554 --> 01:14:17,765
Something by George Orwell.

673
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:21,476
He abhorred violence too.

674
01:14:21,643 --> 01:14:26,981
But I guess he understood
when it became necessity.

675
01:15:34,454 --> 01:15:36,205
Got you.

676
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:42,044
You just gave away your position!

677
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:45,755
We don't have much time!

678
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,202
Get back!

679
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:29,041
Pavel!

680
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,882
Oh, shit.

681
01:16:39,883 --> 01:16:41,468
Talk to me.

682
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:02,069
Talk to me, kid.

683
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:06,864
I'm hit.

684
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:10,701
How bad?

685
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,411
My friend.

686
01:17:18,582 --> 01:17:21,293
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

687
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:27,006
Today was going to be
like my birthday.

688
01:17:28,507 --> 01:17:31,510
Well, hang in there, son.
The helo's inbound.

689
01:17:35,471 --> 01:17:37,682
You never told me...

690
01:17:38,474 --> 01:17:40,642
...why you came...

691
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:42,727
...back for me.

692
01:17:47,481 --> 01:17:49,441
I was in Panama...

693
01:17:49,608 --> 01:17:51,943
...captured and tortured...

694
01:17:52,986 --> 01:17:56,948
...and a young operative
like yourself saved my life.

695
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,786
I figured I owed him one.

696
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,207
But you came back for me.

697
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,210
You'd do the same for me.

698
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:13,978
Here he comes.

699
01:20:14,312 --> 01:20:16,355
Let's go.

700
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,243
Look at me. I'm a mess!

701
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:34,579
Belay that.
We're gonna get you out of here.

702
01:21:06,022 --> 01:21:07,982
Good to go!

703
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:14,529
Faster!

704
01:21:52,185 --> 01:21:54,312
I'm so warm.

705
01:21:55,605 --> 01:21:57,481
I thought I'd be cold.

706
01:22:01,652 --> 01:22:04,070
Shouldn't I be cold?

707
01:22:08,365 --> 01:22:12,202
The mission's over, son.
You're going home.

708
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,628
I don't mind dying.

709
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:27,632
I just didn't want to die in that cage.

710
01:22:50,442 --> 01:22:52,694
Freedom!
