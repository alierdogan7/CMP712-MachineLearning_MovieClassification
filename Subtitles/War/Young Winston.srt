till 11, does he?

Well, ma'am, looking at you now,

346
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:57,880
it's a wonder to me
he bothers to get out at all.

Good evening.
Welcome home, milady.

Marlene. Is Lord Randolph in?

No, milady.
Oh. Where's Everest?

352
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,676
I'm here,
Lady Randolph.

If I might speak to you?
Now, please.

354
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,002
When did this happen?

355
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,359
Have you called the doctor?

356
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,278
We shall be taking him
out of that place.

Won't we, milady?

00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,754
INTERVIEWER: Ladies and gentlemen,
Lord Randolph Churchill,

359
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:09,403
Secretary of State for India.

360
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:12,283
Lord Randolph. Many people
give you the major credit

361
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,878
for the return of the Conservative Party
to power.

362
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:17,842
Yet there is a rumour that
you tendered your resignation

363
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,995
to the prime minister,
Lord Salisbury.

364
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:23,952
I trust I am not here to exchange gossip
or to encourage a rumour.

365
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:27,639
INTERVIEWER: But you will not deny there
is friction between yourself and Lord Salisbury.

366
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:30,523
I refuse to discuss
that any further.

367
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,596
To put an end to it,
let me say

368
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:37,963
that I have never run away from a fight
when I believed it necessary.

369
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,684
But I am and always will be
loyal to the Tory Party.

370
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:42,877
Mind you...

371
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,322
some of my friends in my own party
have a great lesson to learn.

372
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,759
The Tory Party
will never remain in power

373
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:53,803
until it gains the confidence of the minorities
and the working classes.

374
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:58,037
Because the working classes are quite
determined to govern themselves.

375
00:32:58,204 --> 00:33:01,401
INTERVIEWER: Ah, yes. Your theory
of Tory democracy.

376
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:04,716
It is said that there are
few who take it seriously.

377
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:05,953
Really?

378
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:08,001
Yes. After all,
as an aristocrat

379
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:11,793
it's difficult to accept you
as an advocate of democracy.

380
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:13,920
Many people think
you use it as a device

381
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:18,157
to make yourself prime minister
in Lord Salisbury's place.

382
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,841
Do you?

383
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:24,440
Not at all.
Good.

384
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:28,432
Recently, you've expressed strong views
on the state of the Irish question.

385
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:33,439
Ah, well...
The Irish question...

386
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:36,118
That, I'm afraid,
will never be solved.

387
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:37,883
Quite.

388
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:41,593
Now, Lord Randolph,
on a more personal note,

389
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:44,961
you and Lady Randolph,
the former American heiress Jennie Jerome,

390
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,955
are leaders of society.

391
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:50,480
Your racehorses are most
successful, you entertain lavishly,

392
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:54,239
and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
attends your dinners frequently.

393
00:33:54,404 --> 00:33:55,837
And Lady Randolph
and you

394
00:33:56,004 --> 00:34:00,156
are identified with all that is new
and fashionable.

00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:02,599
Your splendid home
here in Connaught Place

396
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:06,313
is one of the few
to have electric lighting.

397
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:10,716
How do you find it?
Do you prefer it to gas?

398
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:13,712
Well, it's all rather
up-to-date, I suppose.

399
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:16,637
That thing in the cellar...
I think you call it the dynamo.

400
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,760
...is rather noisy.

401
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:22,280
The lights will keep going out
always at the wrong times.

402
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:25,675
No, I don't think that electric light will
ever replace gas.

403
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,914
At least, not in private houses.
No, no.

404
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,042
I believe, Lord Randolph,
you have a son.

405
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:34,002
What? Yes, actually.
Two.

406
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:36,803
Two sons,
Winston and Jack.

407
00:34:36,964 --> 00:34:40,240
No doubt, they're very
proud of their father.

CHURCHILL: I had scarcely passed
my 12th birthday

414
00:34:53,964 --> 00:34:58,196
when I entered the inhospitable
regions of examinations,

415
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:00,600
through which,
for the next seven years

416
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,675
I was destined to journey.

417
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:05,836
These examinations
were a great trial to me.

00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:14,676
I should have lik ed to be ask ed
to say what I knew.

They always contrived
to ask what I did not know.

420
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:22,041
This sort of treatment
had only one result:

421
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,002
I did not do well
in examinations.

This was especially true

of my entrance examination
to Harrow.

425
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:47,878
I wrote my name
at the top of the page.

426
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:53,073
I wrote the number
of the question: one.

427
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:59,076
And after much reflection,
I put a brack et around it.

428
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,594
But thereafter, I could not think
of anything connected with it

429
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:05,119

relevant or true.

from nowhere in particular

indications of scholarship

437

that Mr. Welldon, the headmaster

drew the conclusion that I was worthy
to pass into Harrow.

01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:47,081
that you interest yourself a great
deal in your son Winston's affairs...

1036
01:16:47,244 --> 01:16:48,916
and in his advancement.

1037
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:51,757
But I should be a most
unnatural mother if I didn't.

1038
01:16:51,924 --> 01:16:53,801
Of course.

1039
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:56,603
But there are those who
find an interesting contrast

1040
01:16:56,764 --> 01:16:58,880
between your efforts
on his behalf now

1041
01:16:59,044 --> 01:17:03,037
and your neglect of him
when he was a child.

1042
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:06,280
Neglect?

1043
01:17:06,564 --> 01:17:09,158
But that was never the case.

1044
01:17:09,724 --> 01:17:11,442
That is vicious and hurtful.

1045
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:14,516
My son never lacked
a mother's love.

1046
01:17:15,004 --> 01:17:18,758
Naturally, when he was a child, he went off
to school. The very best of schools.

1047
01:17:18,924 --> 01:17:21,358
At home, he had my attention
and a marvellous nanny

1048
01:17:21,524 --> 01:17:24,596
who was with us almost
from the time he was born.

1049
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:28,156
Naturally, I was at the same time
devoted to my husband's career,

1050
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:31,521
as any wife would be.
I see.

1051
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:33,003
You do, on occasion,

1052
01:17:33,164 --> 01:17:36,554

for the Prince of Wales.

1053
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:41,195
His Royal Highness finds you charming,
gracious, amusing.

1054
01:17:42,364 --> 01:17:45,117
You are at liberty to think so.

1055
01:17:46,284 --> 01:17:48,878
But if you are insinuating
the slightest impropriety...

1056
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:53,117
Not at all, dear lady. Not at all.
Please be calm.

1057
01:17:53,284 --> 01:17:55,195
I am perfectly calm.

1058
01:17:55,364 --> 01:17:56,843
Then we can proceed.

1059
01:17:57,044 --> 01:18:00,400
You are aware, of course, that your name
has been linked with another royal personage...

1060
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:03,761
Count Charles Kinsky,
the well-known sportsman.

1061
01:18:07,324 --> 01:18:10,236
I don't know what
you mean by "linked".

1062
01:18:11,444 --> 01:18:13,639
We are friends.

1063
01:18:13,804 --> 01:18:15,317
We have been friends
for many years.

1064
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,679
Yes, friends.
Exactly.

1065
01:18:17,844 --> 01:18:21,553
Friends. Yet, at one time,
there was gossip, malicious, of course,

1066
01:18:21,724 --> 01:18:24,636
that your marriage to Lord Randolph was,
shall we say, pro forma.

1067
01:18:24,804 --> 01:18:26,760
And that in the event
of a divorce, you and Count...

1068
01:18:26,924 --> 01:18:28,516
There was never
a possibility of divorce.

1069
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:30,561
But you and Count Kinsky
are still friends?

1070
01:18:30,724 --> 01:18:32,555
Yes.

1071
01:18:37,844 --> 01:18:40,358
Charles was married shortly
before my husband died.

1072
01:18:40,524 --> 01:18:43,960
Three weeks before,
in his own country, in Austria.

1073
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:45,716
He has remained
there ever since.

1074
01:18:46,324 --> 01:18:48,997
He has great responsibilities
there.

1075
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:51,399
One last question.

1076
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:54,442
What precisely was the nature
of your husband's last illness?

1077
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:59,720
It is well-known.

1078
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:01,602
It was caused by overwork.

1079
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:04,318
Ah, yes. But the symptoms were most
curious, were they not?

1080
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:07,478
I don't know
what you mean.

1081
01:19:07,644 --> 01:19:09,919
But surely you were aware
of your husband's symptoms?

1082
01:19:10,084 --> 01:19:11,437
I think this has
gone far enough.

1083
01:19:11,604 --> 01:19:13,754
But this is of great
interest to the public.

1084
01:19:13,924 --> 01:19:16,916
Is it? Why should it be?

1085
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:19,678
Why should it be of any concern
to what you call the public?

1086
01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:23,553
The public is everyone.
And the public has a right to know.

1087
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:26,602
Why? What right?

1088
01:19:26,764 --> 01:19:28,800
I don't know anything
about such a right.

recently resigned from the army

Thank you,

There is gossip that you were detested
in the army...

1212
01:33:29,764 --> 01:33:32,039

known as a medal hunter,

1216
01:33:42,604 --> 01:33:44,720
I was wondering why
a certain kind of person

1217

the worst about me.

1218
01:33:47,444 --> 01:33:49,196
At Sandhurst, for example,
I was accused of being

1219
01:33:49,364 --> 01:33:51,673
everything from a horse thief
to a homosexual.

1220
01:33:51,844 --> 01:33:56,474
And I had to sue for libel, and win,
to prove my innocence on both counts.

Yes.

Some officers have stated that
your criticism of General Kitchener

1225
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:11,152

No.

My statements concerning
his atrocious treatment of enemy wounded

1229
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:20,483
were entirely factual.

1230
01:34:20,644 --> 01:34:23,442
As to our victory,
although the enemy had superior numbers,

1231
01:34:23,604 --> 01:34:25,401
they were no match

Your father also had

1233

a weakness for offending
people, did he not?

1234
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:34,114
I wouldn't call it a weakness.

1235
01:34:34,284 --> 01:34:36,434
I would describe
it as his strength.

1236
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:40,035
And I would attribute it to the strength
of his convictions.

1237
01:34:40,204 --> 01:34:43,799
My father was a brilliant man.
He had no time for fools.

1238

Yes. Actually,

disagreed at times

of politics, isn't it?

I dedicated my book to him.

for in your father's name?
