00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,245
Master Bediuzzaman's
opinions about cinema and art:

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,488
'The lord must be as elaborate as
the nature of its meaning allows.

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,450
The form must be drawn
according to its content...

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,843
...and the meaning's permission
must be taken during its drawing.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:42,966
The style must be featured, but the purpose
and meaning must never be failed.

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,603
The imagination must be supported
with an ample scope...

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,285
...but the truth must never be hurt.'

00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,568

00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,485

A FILM BY MEHMET TANRISEVER

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,247
Nurs Village - Bitlis 1882

12
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,165
Bismillah! (in the name of God)

13
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,726
Look! The moon has eclipsed!

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,403
What does it mean, mom?
Why is it like that?

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,608
Because a snake has swallowed the moon.

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,250
But it is still visible.

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,161
The snakes above are like glass,
they show Ihat's inside.

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,082
Bismillah!

19
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,410
Bismillah is the beginning
of every charity, son.

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,604
Don't be afraid mom, don't be afraid!
I am next to you.

21
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,205
Declare the concision of Koran.

22
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,810
Don't be afraid, brothers.

23
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,209
The freedom is in the faith.

24
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,526
We will fight with the knowledge
against the ignorance.

25
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,801
We will tight with art and craft
against poverty.

26
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:46,370
We will tight with unity and solidarity
against controversy

27
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,602
EASTERN FRONT 1916

28
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,403
Magnificence and grandeur pertains to Allah
and we only obey to Him!

29
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,683
These cannon balls of the infidels can't kill us!

30
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,570
Felt-caps! We will not deign to retreat!
We will not deign to retreat!

31
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,123
Bismillah! Allahu Ekber!

32
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,722
Write my brother Mullah Habib!

33
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,605
Bismillah is the beginning of each and
every charity. We too start with it.

34
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,487
Kosturma Prisoner Camp - Russia 1916

35
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,321
Attention!

36
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,769
Stand up. Stand up.

37
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,408
Stand up. Stand up.

38
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,930
I don't think he recognized me.

39
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,242
I don't think you recognized the commander.

40
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,326
I did. He is the chief commander of
Caucasian Front Nikola Nikolovich.

41
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,409
He is the uncle of Russian Czar.

42
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,450
I did. He is the chief commander of
Caucasian Front Nikola Nikolovich.

43
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,886
He is the uncle of Russian Czar

44
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,809
So you are insulting me.

45
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,650
So you are insulting.

46
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,168
No, I am not insulting.

47
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,081
I duly oblige my faith.
I am a Moslem scholar.

48
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,244
So I lon't rise.

49
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,001
Stand up immediately!

50
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,761
By not standing up, you are insulting me,
my army and the Czar!

51
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,925
By not standing up, you are insulting me,
my army and the Czar!

52
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,884
This is a big crime!

53
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,247
This is a big crime!

54
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,524
Set up an immediate court martial and try him!

55
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,488
-What is this? An escape plan?
-What is this? An escape plan?

56
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,403
No. This is the plan of my school!

57
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,003
You should say your last prayer
instead of thinking such plans.

58
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,369
Youll probably be executed soon.

59
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,965
You may never know commander!

60
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,691
Fate is unique, can't be changed.

61
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,689
Take aim!

62
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,001
Fire!

63
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,129
Please don't kill me! Don't kill!

64
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,245
Take aim!

65
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,362
Fire!

66
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
Stop!

67
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,921
A man who is about to be executed takes it slow.
Why do you hurry?

68
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,409
A man who is about to be executed takes it slow.
Why do you hurry?

69
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,687
I want to reach my Lord as soon as possible!

70
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,248
I am sorry! I thought your intention
las to insult me.

71
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,366
I am sorry! I thought your intention
las to insult me.

72
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:24,211
Now I see that your behaviors
truly come from your faith.

73
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,369
After 2 years of captivity, Said Nursi
found a chance to goto Istanbul via Europe...

74
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,731
...in the chaos of 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.

75
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,568
He started a civil resistance
against British occupation.

76
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,648
He las officially invited to Ankara
by Mustafa Kemal Pasha...

77
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,408
...for his activities supporting
Kuvay-l Milliye (National Forces).

78
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,247
He wasn't satisfied with the negotiations he did
after his address to the congress.

79
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,606
He lent to Van City.

80
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,411
SHEIKH SAID REBELLION - 1925

81
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,686
Stop! What are you doing?

82
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,281
We are revolting Seyda!

83
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,525
Against what? Against who are you revolting?

84
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,685
The caliphate has been abolished.

85
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,801
An irreligious government has been established
in Ankara, we are revolting against this, Seyda!

86
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,283
Fighting against the descendants of a nation who
served Islam for thousand years is against Islam!

87
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,608
Bismillah.

88
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,851
My Allah!

89
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:50,008
I want to explain the whole world that
Koran is an undying, inextinguishable sun.

90
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,125
Help me!

91
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,881
Surrender Hodja! We came to take you.

92
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,921
What am I accused of?

93
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,531
We have orders.

94
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,889
What do you want from us?

95
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,767
These people have nothing to do
with the Sheikh Said rebellion!

96
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,727
It is a mistake to take away
the scholars of this city!

97
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,882
If they go, the people won't be educated!

98
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Take us, send us to exile but let our scholars free!

99
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,762
Hodja! Let's go!

100
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,804
We will flee you away.

101
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,848
Our horses and men are ready!

102
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,328
Let's go in this mess.

103
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,971
We will take you to Iran.

104
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,643
Come on Hodja. That's our chance!

105
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,044
Don't lorry!
Said is not going to exile, but to his cause!

106
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,851
Hey you, move away.
What are you talking about? Go away!

107
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,044
Handcuff them two by two!

108
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,249
Come on, stand up! Stand up!

109
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,004
Enough. Enough!

110
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,562
We have nothing to do with the revolt!

111
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,723
We aren't involved in the evolt!

112
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,769
We didn't even see Sheikh Said!

113
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,843
Stand up! Move!

114
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,764
Bediuzzaman has stopped us!

115
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,689
It is a huge mistake to hold him!

116
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,603
At least let him free!

117
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,845
Assalamualaikum Seyda!

118
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,642
Waalaikummussalam Sheikh Masum Arvasi brother!

119
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,562
They didn't care you are the Mufti of Van City
and arrested you too?

120
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,008
Yes Seyda!
I don't think they know what they're doing.

121
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,529
That's true, brother.

122
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,961
These men don't know what they are doing,
but someone knows it!

123
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,368
Stop. Listen to me!

124
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,083
There is nothing to lorry!

125
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:59,248
These soldiers are not our enemies,
but your brothers! Don't counter!

126
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,685
I have surrendered to Allah. I am going
to the heart of Anatolia with my own lill...

127
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,730
...into the caring arms of my nation!

128
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,050
One of the Van exiles,
the hodja named Said-i Kurdi...

129
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,166
...has been sent to your district,
accompanying with a gendarme...

130
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,922
...to stay compulsorily.

131
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,291
Do not be fooled by
his innocent manners.

132
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,965
His ideas are extremely dangerous.

133
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,168
Warn the people and
break his contact with the people.

134
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,201
Keep him under surveillance and
report the developments to provincial authorities.

135
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,564
Signed: Governor of Isparta.

136
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,729
We shouldn't travel in this leather
but let's hope the best.

137
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,566
I have my orders. I will bring this hodja
to Barla today even the Flood breaks!

138
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,729
Look at the act of Allah, look at the leather.

139
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,044
Soldier friend, how do you bring this hodja
on your own, don't you scare?

140
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,042
I told the same to my commander.

141
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,965
But told me that he is a saintly person,
and does not hurt anyone.

142
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,169
It's the time.
Excuse me.

143
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,089
What is it, hodja?

144
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,562
Boatman, turn the boat to the direction of Mecca,
the hodja will perform the namaz.

145
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,127
I shot it! I shot it, hodja,
I shot it! I shot the partridge!

146
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,124
Let it go, soldier friend!
It's the breeding time!

147
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,164
Ouch my foot!
Hodja!

148
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,291
Is he too dangerous?

149
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,051
And how!
The District Administrator said so.

150
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,688
His ideas are very dangerous.
They will jail everyone who speaks to him.

151
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,331
That's enough.

152
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,723
You don't know what you are talking about.

153
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,211
What kind of a people you are!

154
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,049
You believe everything like children!
You have to shame on your age!

155
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,926
OK, fine. We are cowards
and you are brave huh?

156
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,447
Go greet him and End yourself in the jailhouse.

157
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,331
Sure I will go!
They can do whatever they lill.

158
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,886
Here he comes!

159
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,406
-Assalamualaikum!
-Waalaikummussalam.

160
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,966
Welcome.

161
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,244
What is this all about?

162
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,644
Commander, I hope this hodja is not a
dangerous person as the Governor says.

163
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,049
If he were, they would have sent him
with a squad of soldiers.

164
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,528
Oh yeah, look to the Gendarme, look.

165
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,171
What is this?

166
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,643
What is going on?

167
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,447
What is this?

168
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,682
Guardian, go help the soldier.

169
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,328
-Welcome hodja!
-Thank you

170
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,848
I am the District Administrator Yasar!

171
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,809
Top Sergeant is the commander of our patrol.

172
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,809
Sir!
I am from 18th Regiment.

173
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,281
Don't lorry about the report.
Go and get a treatment!

174
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,126
Thank you, sir!

175
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,805
This is the file of the hodja.

176
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,368
Take him inside, soldier friend.

177
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,848
Please hodja, please come in.

178
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,605
Come in.

179
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,969
Oh, is that you Emigrant Hodja?
Wait outside, I am coming!

180
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,241
I will give the hodja into your custody.
But you have to be very careful!

181
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,645
He is very dangerous.
Don't take your eyes away from him!

182
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,049
But mister administrator.
You know him wrong!

183
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,807
Enough, shut up and know your limits Emigrant.

184
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,846
Ifl say that he is dangerous, then he is dangerous!
Do you know better than me?

185
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,451
Look, they will not only hang you,
but me and the top sergeant as well.

186
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,002
Do not take your eyes away from him.
Do you know what happened in the east, huh?

187
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,729
They hanged thousands of hodjas.
Do you know that?

188
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,924
Life is sleet Emigrant, life is sleet.
You are responsible from him. Be careful.

189
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,443
And don't talk about this to anyone.

190
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,041
Please come, hodja.
I was waiting for you.

191
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,002
-Allow me to take it.
-It is not necessarily.

192
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,208
-Let me take it, my hodja,
-All right.

193
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,201
Please come in my hodja.
My humble house is on that lay.

194
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,682
I am the imam of this village, hodja.

195
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,362
As our grandfathers immigrated from Rumelia,
they call me Emigrant.

196
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,325
And I know a little about being an imam,
so they call me Emigrant Hatiz.

197
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,330
Hodja, I had read on the newspaper.

198
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,209
You made a wonderful speech
in the Congress in Ankara.

199
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,408
Everybody esteemed you,
listened your lords.

200
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
But hodja...

201
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,286
Even though they know very well that
you did not participate into Sheikh Said rebellion...

202
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,729
...why did they send you to exile?
What do they want from you, hodja?

203
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,602
Allah may give you happiness
in both worlds my brother.

204
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,571
Hodja, you take rest.
I will have your meal ready.

205
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,565
Come in.

206
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,205
You too, come.

207
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,449
Open your hands.

208
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,804
The breakfast is ready, husband.

209
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,927
All right.
I will let hodja know.

210
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,408
Hodja!

211
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,685
My honorable Hodja!

212
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,731
Hodja.

213
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,086
He is not here!
He is gone!

214
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,767
Oh no! What will I say to
District Administrator now?

215
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,680
-Look, did you see the hodja?
-No, I didn't see him.

216
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,204
You didn't see?
Oh my God, where did the man go?

217
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,684
What will I do now?

218
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,728
The administrator will hang you!
The administrator will hang you!

219
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,689
Allah forbid.

220
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,251
I know! I know!

221
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,485
Do you knol? Listen lunatic, please tell me
for Allah's sake. Where did he go?

222
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,687
There he is. There he is!

223
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,284
-Hodja, Assalamualaikum.
-Waalaikummussalam.

224
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,081
I'm sorry hodja, just curious,
what are you doing here?

225
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,207
I am laying the foundation of my school.

226
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,883
-What's it hodja, what school?
-Medresetiiz-Zehra. My new school.

227
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:33,367
One day mister Hatiz,
this Barla that you see, will be a great school!

228
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,322
And with Allah's willing, its branches will be
opened in the entire world!

229
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,685
If Allah willing, hodja.

230
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,006
What's going on, husband?

231
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,922
We had a stroke of a great luck, life!

232
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,887
This place used to be the village hall.

233
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,249
Now you can stay here alone and rest.

234
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:28,007
Hodja, I just wondered.
Why didn't you stay in Emigrant's house?

235
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,648
I didn't want to disturb him.

236
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,563
I see. Oh hodja, let me tell you this.

237
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,684
Ankara is uncomfortable about you.
Please don't put me in a hard situation OK?

238
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,483
We support the law and order, administrator.
You don't have to worry.

239
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,647
Just don't fall into the same delusions with Ankara.

240
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
You are right about that.

241
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,208
Mister hodja, the view here is really nice.

242
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,045
Do you see this maple tree?

243
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,727
It must be 800 to 1000 years old.

244
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,884
Hello my maple brother. Hello.

245
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,206
Welcome, come in.

246
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,601
Come on look what I will give you.
You came also?

247
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,570
And you will also come?
Come in.

248
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,724
You are my first visitors.

249
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,124
The believers, the immigrants, and the ones
who tight with all their properties and lives...

250
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,807
...in a holy lar for Allah
have great values on Allah's side.

251
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,645
Those are who reach
to salvation and bliss.

252
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,131
-Assalamualaikum, hodja!
-Waalaikummussalam.

253
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,323
-Let me carry for you.
-Don't bother yourself.

254
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,647
Not at all.

255
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,005
Let me take.

256
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,721
Welcome to Barla, hodja.
My name is Suleyman.

257
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,042
Thank you brother. My name is Said.

258
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,650
-Where are you from, hodja?
-I am from Nurs village of Bitlis.

259
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,451
They brought you from so far away huh?

260
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,685
Here.

261
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,967
Assalamualaikum.

262
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,130
Waalaikummussalam Suleyman brother,
please come in.

263
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,687
Come in.

264
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,968
-I brought you larm soup, hodja.
-Thank you.

265
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,602
-And these are your new shoes.
-Please come and sit.

266
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,566
I better not sit.
I will go to district directorate.

267
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,324
I have a field problem you know.

268
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,642
All right my brother, all right.
How much are the shoes?

269
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,009
-They cost 2 Liras my hodja.
-Two Liras. Here is the price of the shoes.

270
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,083
And this ten kurus for the soup.

271
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,529
I can't take it, hodja.
It is a treat.

272
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,251
Yes you can, my brother. Take it.

273
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,001
Hodja, I am an illiterate man.

274
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,601
How about if I come here time to time
and you tell me about Allah and prophet.

275
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,603
You can come anytime, brother.

276
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,004
But only with the condition that, this doesn't hinder
the livelihoods of your family and your children.

277
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,367
They are making great preparations in Ankara.
The script will be changed.

278
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,283
The books will be completely renewed.

279
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,282
The dress code be changed.

280
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,126
And superstitions such as religion and afterlife
will be removed from the books.

281
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,011
-It's not possible mister inspector.
-What do you mean, administrator?

282
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,561
I mean, whose idea is this?

283
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,683
Europe praised education, science,
technology, and abandoned the religion...

284
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,649
...so they progressed.
What did we do?

285
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,006
What did we do?

286
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,606
We praised Allah and Allah and we regressed.
That's the lay it is going to be.

287
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,602
You just don't bother
whose idea this is.

288
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,481
Or you will get into a big trouble.

289
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,043
Just don't say I didn't lam you.

290
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,969
They will remove all the religion and so.
We will be like the Europeans.

291
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,088
-What is it, hodja?
-So it is, huh!

292
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,008
Hodja.

293
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,839
Meal.

294
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,171
Hodja.

295
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,769
What happened to hodja, Suleyman?

296
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,488
I will never ever allow this.
I will prove. I will prove.

297
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,561
Allah is my witness, I will prove this.
I will never allow this.

298
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,251
I will never allow this.
Allah is my witness, I will prove this.

299
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,287
TAHIR PASHA RESIDENCY - VAN 1907

300
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,601
Mullah Said, you have some perseverance, huh!

301
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,371
You have been my guest in my mansion for a year.

302
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,605
You have read and finished all the books
in my library about religion and science.

303
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,569
God knows you already memorized them.
Last week you said 80 volumes, right?

304
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,247
We fell really very behind of Europe
on sciences, Pasha.

305
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,042
So we have to work hard.
The Ottoman is collapsing because of this reason.

306
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,964
We must do something.

307
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,769
I lent to the Ottoman Sultan
to suggest opening schools...

308
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,571
...in which the religion
and science will be taught together...

309
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,967
...and I found myself in a nut house.

310
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,207
We can illuminate the darkness of the
ignorance only with Koran's divine light.

311
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,121
That's how we can rise.

312
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,251
Someone is obviously alare of this.
Look at the newspaper.

313
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,645
The British Secretary for the Colonies adressed
the House of Commons with a Koran in his hand.

314
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,411
'As long as this Koran stays in the hands of the
Muslims, we can't truly dominate them.

315
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,851
We should either take Koran from them,
or alienate them from the Koran!

316
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
We will bring them in such a position that they will
read Koran, but will not understand its meaningl'

317
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,689
Koran is an undying, inextinguishable Sun!

318
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,085
I will prove this to the entire world.
Allah is my witness, I will prove it.

319
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,885
Please Allah, grant it to me!

320
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,603
Nol look at Allah's merciful arts.

321
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,930
How come a Creator of
endless mercy and power...

322
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,801
...who ressurects a dead and lizened
world and gives life to it...

323
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,931
...who turns winters into springs
and show His might in recreating...

324
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,167
...more then three hundred thousand plant species...

325
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,881
...does not bring the Judgment day?

326
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,604
How come He does not
or cannot bring the Judgment Day?

327
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,720
How come He does not
or cannot resurrect humans?

328
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,047
A needle cannot be without a craftsman;
a letter cannot be without a clerk...

329
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,646
...a book cannot be without a writer!

330
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,086
On the earth page of this book of universe,
every tree is a lord...

331
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,165
...every fruit is a letter
and every kernel is a dot.

332
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,210
-Selamiinaleykiim uncle.
-Waalaikummussalam.

333
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,045
-How are you, are you fine?
-I'm fine.

334
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,646
-How is your health? Let me kiss your hand.
-Thank you.

335
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,090
Look what I brought for you.

336
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,245
Mehmet!

337
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,370
-Mehmet of Damascus!
-Assalamualaikum. Welcome!

338
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,568
Waalaikummussalam, thank you uncle Emigrant.

339
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,326
Do you know who came to Barla after you left?

340
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,206
I wish the best.

341
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,044
It's good.

342
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,409
My hodja! It is you!

343
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,131
It is you, hodja.
Welcome, hodja!

344
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,648
You're welcome, you're welcome.

345
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,121
Thanks my Lord, I saw you again!

346
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,206
God bless you by brother, God bless you.

347
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,922
-Don't bother hodja, let me do it.
-You are my guest. Please.

348
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,123
-Please.
-Thank you, hodja.

349
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,846
Hodja. I can't forget that day.

350
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,004
I las just 13 years old
I saw you in Damascus.

351
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,244
We listened to you in Umayyad mosque
together with my father.

352
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,289
What a wonderful speech that las, hodja.

353
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,524
My father's told me to serve you as his lill.

354
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,809
Please allow me to serve you, hodja!

355
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,364
Not at all.
Not to me, let's serve to Koran together.

356
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,481
Write it down, brother!

357
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,086
First lord.

358
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,486
Bismillah is the beginning of
each and every charity.

359
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,685
The faith is both the divine light and the power.

360
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,120
The faith makes a man a human
and maybe a sultan.

361
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,721
Assalamualaikum.

362
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,761
-Waalaikummussalam.
-Waalaikummussalam.

363
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,771
-I brought some food for you.
-Thank you brother.

364
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,444
How are you, hodja,
is your health good?

365
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,082
-Thanks Allah. I hope you are also in good health.
-Thanks Allah, hodja.

366
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,124
Praise be.

367
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,081
Please.

368
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:32,284
Look at AIIah's mercy arts,
look how he resurrects the world after death.

369
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,082
Doubtlessly, He who makes it
is the one who resurrects the death people.

370
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,844
His power is enough for everything.

371
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,368
Husband, you've been lriting the
treatise of the divine light since the evening.

372
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,086
Drink your coffee and take some rest,
let me write a little bit.

373
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,649
Thank you my life, thank you.

374
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,048
After hodja came, the peace and
the prosperity in the house grew.

375
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,401
Thanks to him. Our master
taught us to live frugally, my life.

376
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,006
Let's lurk hard and lrite much, brothers.

377
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,641
These divine lights illuminate Barla
and all the villages lith Allah's willing.

378
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:44,050
Look at AIIah's mercy arts,
look how he resurrects the world after death.

379
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,484
Doubtlessly, He who makes it
is the one who resurrects the death people.

380
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,130
His power is enough for everything.

381
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,331
-Assalamualaikum.
-Waalaikummussalam.

382
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,209
I brought you cherries, hodja.

383
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,840
-How much is a basket of cherries?
-Five kurus, master.

384
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,968
Not ten kurus my master. I said Eve kurus.

385
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,803
No! I brought them as a present,
I will not take the money.

386
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,330
-Then I will not take the cherries!
-We don't take, neither.

387
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,641
We, neither.

388
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,483
-Yes Mehmet.
-All right, master.

389
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,970
Here.

390
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,770
We are writing non-stop my master...

391
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,441
...but who will know about what we write
in this middle of nowhere?

392
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,287
Felt-capped! Felt-capped!

393
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,043
One day, the whole world will read these writings!

394
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,489
Both my writings and Barla are very important!

395
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,963
Barla will serve like a school!

396
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,730
The divine light written here,
will spread to the whole world!

397
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:23,331
You are still not alare
what kind of a cause you are helping and why.

398
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,885
Guard...

399
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,442
-...what are they doing over there?
-They are writing and reading.

400
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,763
-What?
-They are writing and reading.

401
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,124
God is Almighty. God is Almighty.
(prayer call in Turkish)

402
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,450
God is Almighty. God is Almighty.

403
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,090
Oh Lord.

404
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,889
Everything is going to change, guard.
Everything is going to change.

405
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,001
-Everything?
-Everything.

406
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,245
Who are you?

407
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,447
Who are you?

408
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,440
I am asking you who you are,
and you are asking me who I am.

409
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,171
Now I am asking you, who are you?
I am the District Administrator.

410
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,607
District Administrator.

411
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,766
-Do you know what these are?
-What?

412
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,844
These are called Treatise of Divine Light.

413
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,167
These are going out from this small district
till Ankara, making them anxious!

414
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,481
Even though they are lritten in the banned script
they are passing from hand to hand.

415
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,371
Are you sleeping?
Are you blind, District Administrator?

416
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,808
Well, and you are...?

417
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,968
I am sorry sir, my apologies.

418
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:29,763
We sent him to the most remote corner
for oblivion, but you couldn't silence him.

419
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,487
You made him more famous!
You just couldn't control him.

420
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,727
Shame on you!

421
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,443
He is only writing sir.

422
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,811
He writes, but he writes another script,
District Administrator.

423
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,163
May it be easy, sister Zehra!

424
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,964
Seeing you carrying the woods,
Friend Hafiz must be very busy, I assume.

425
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,811
Who is she, guard?

426
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,528
She is the wife of
Mehmet Hafiz of Damascus.

427
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,723
Hafiz of Damascus. Who is he?

428
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,691
He is one of the Hodja's major,
most royal men.

429
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,285
Oh! So he is!

430
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,051
Welcome sir.

431
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,445
Where the hell are your hats?
Didn't you hear the new law?

432
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,409
Listen to me! From not on, everybody
will wear a fedora like this gentleman.

433
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,922
If can't find it, then wear this.

434
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,040
But we don't have money.

435
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,444
'We don't have money.'
Take them oh'. Come on.

436
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,168
Don't you even have chickens!
Sell them and buy one.

437
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,330
Listen to me.

438
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,850
From not on it is forbidden
to go out without a hat. Do not break the order.

439
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,725
I'II put you in jail.
You will fade in prison.

440
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,245
Move it!

441
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,724
Ignorant folks, sir!
They don't know about the civilization.

442
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,882
Where is hodja, guard?
Where is the hodja?

443
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,249
We are almost there, sir.

444
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,284
Why didn't you take off your turban brother?
There is a law.

445
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,161
Yes my friend. The government gave an order.
We have to obey this order.

446
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,368
If the guard sees you, he will seize you.

447
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,410
-Take it off. Do you want to get into trouble?
-Is it worth for a turban?

448
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,086
Will you fade away in prison?
You have a family. Pity.

449
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,483
Aleykiimselam.

450
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,206
-He came from Ankara, from Ankara!
-Oh, is that so!

451
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,681
Who are they, guard?

452
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,922
That one is Hafiz Ali of islémkiiy.

453
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,843
The other one is from Sav village.
That one is Hiisrev of Isparta.

454
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,682
And the other one is Captain Hulusi.

455
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,081
Captain?

456
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,530
And who are they?

457
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,523
They call them Divine Light's Messengers.
They are lriting and distributing.

458
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,127
And you are just staring, is that so?

459
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,167
Yes please?

460
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,684
You too?

461
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,046
Me too, brother.

462
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,042
The man has established not an organization,
but a state!

463
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,851
What has he done in this small district?

464
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,611
Where is this hodja? Where is he, guard?

465
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,325
Where are they, guard? Where are they?

466
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,641
Dear sir:
One day, together with the toln's guard...

467
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,289
we climbed to a hill
which the local people call Pine Mountain.

468
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,126
771ese men are crazy. I saw it, sir:

469
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,127
They are climbing to the mountains
and lriting books, reading books.

470
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,045
Their number is increasing every day.

471
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,603
Guard told me tllaL they climb
every summer to Pine Mountain like the nomads.

472
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,600
Said-i Nursi asks them to do this.

473
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,730
771is man is really crazy.
He doesn't wear the hat, either, sir!

474
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,168
E verybudy keeps in step with the mndemity...

475
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,925
...ony he and his students
are not changing their clothes. They are crazy, sir.

476
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,849
They camp on the top of the mountain,
they are organizing and training.

477
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,204
They are breaking the bans
and challenging the modernity.

478
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,401
VW1at do you avant me to do about these camps?
I am waiting for your orders. ismet.

479
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,129
Master.

480
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,443
-May I shave my beard?
-Why Mehmet?

481
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,287
But master, you don't have, either.

482
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,849
My brother Mehmet, I spent a life
with wars and difficulties.

483
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,323
Noll am living in exile.

484
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,445
I fought even for this turban
at the cost of my head.

485
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,691
Ifl had a beard and it las shaved,
I Iouldn't stand it and I would die.

486
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,404
We have guests, master.

487
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,405
Welcome sister.

488
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,206
I brought milk for you hodja.
Goat milk.

489
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,566
God bless you.

490
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,241
-Here.
-I brought this as a present.

491
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,166
Please take this.
It is not how I do things.

492
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,051
I brought partridge for you, hodja.

493
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,088
Thanks. What is your name?

494
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,449
-Sadlk.
-Praise be.

495
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,686
What a nice name you have. I hope
you will be faithful as your name means.

496
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,528
Do you know how to read and write Sadlk?

497
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,608
All right, then I will accept
this partridge with one condition.

498
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,800
-You will learn how to read and write with us, deal?
-Deal hodja.

499
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,127
We shepherd the goats downhill
with my son.

500
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,489
We allays hear your voices.
My son is curious about you.

501
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,440
He imitates your speech every day.
Show him, son.

502
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,446
Bismillah is an endless power,
is an unending blessing.

503
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,724
Praise be! He is a very clever boy.

504
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,166
All right, not go with your mother.

505
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,687
Tomorrow you can come and
study with your brother Mehmet.

506
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,846
-Thank you, hodja.
-God bless you, hodja.

507
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,121
God bless you, too.

508
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,526
Mehmet, is there anyone
who will go to the town?

509
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,965
Praise be.

510
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,291
Uncle hodja.
I learned to write.

511
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,170
Come here, come and sit.

512
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,490
Let me see.

513
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,682
Bravo Sadlk! Your handwriting is beautiful!

514
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,721
-I also like these high hills.
-Hold this.

515
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,286
Look.

516
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,086
Lt also loves heights,
flying freely over the heights.

517
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,240
What do you say,
shall we let it free?

518
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,447
What is happening hodja?

519
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,841
Look! The moon is eclipsed

520
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,411
What does it mean, mom?

521
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,641
Why is it like that?

522
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,763
Because a snake has swallowed the moon.

523
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,203
Don't be afraid my son, don't be afraid.
Say Bismillah!

524
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,562
Bismillah is the beginning of every charity, son.

525
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,368
In astronomy science
this is called the solar eclipse.

526
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,611
Who darkens the sun, hodja?

527
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,970
No one darkens the sun, my son.
Make your hands like fists.

528
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,686
This is the sun, this is the earth
and this is the moon.

529
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,046
When the moon passes between
the sun and earth, it covers the light...

530
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,607
...so the sun is eclipsed.

531
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,963
Don't lorry, nothing can turn oh' the sun light.

532
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,162
Look, it is brightened.

533
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,403
Oh no! My mother told me to come back
early enough. We will milk the goats! I am late!

534
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,091
Where are my shoes.

535
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,806
These are your new shoes, our present.

536
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,521
No, I Ion't wear them!
I don't accept unrequited presents, either.

537
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:49,571
Then write a complete copy of this
and we will be even, ok?

538
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,807
I will write. I will write
the exact copy and bring it.

539
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,967
Silence.

540
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,810
Everybody listen to me.

541
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,045
I will read the reforms
which must be complied from not on!

542
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,685
One: No one will write and read in the old script.
It is banned!

543
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,284
Two: From not on, no one will give the call
for prayers or listen to it in Arabic.

544
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,851
Banned!

545
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,001
-Selamiinaleykiim!
-Waalaikummussalam!

546
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,966
Listen to me.

547
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,250
From not on, no one will talk
to the exiled hodja. It is banned!

548
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,130
Come on, guard. What does the reforms
have got to do anything with talking to hodja?

549
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,249
Listen, from not on it is also forbidden
to play the Saz and singing the folk-songs.

550
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,768
From not on, this one will be played.

551
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,011
-This is called the mandarin. Got it?
-Are you sure it is not orange, guard?

552
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,686
Thank you.

553
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,768
Baker brother! Don't give me
more than I deserved.

554
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,847
-This is redundant. Here.
-Don't mention it, hodja.

555
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,085
I can manage for 15 days with a loaf of bread
and 3 months with a kilo of honey.

556
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,604
My ration is two loaves of bread. I deserved
this much. Wish you a good business.

557
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,683
Hodja you are making our lives easier.

558
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,567
Give me bread. Give me bread.

559
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,282
Here, friend Sevket.

560
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,489
Sevket loves the hodja.
Sevket loves the hodja.

561
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,967
Would you like some, too, kids?

562
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,000
Seyda. Will you accept a guest?

563
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,483
Welcome.
Please come in.

564
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,081
Thank you. Thanks Seyda.

565
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,327
They exiled us to the villages of E§irdir.

566
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,961
We are coming from there.

567
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,807
We are the relatives of Sheikh Said.

568
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,923
Sheikh Said's letter.

569
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,650
Honorable Seyda Nibs.

570
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:52,289
Unfortunately it is no more possible for us
to come to an agreement with the Government.

571
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,490
The religion will be lost.

572
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,963
We're laiting for your urgent support for our cause.

573
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,682
Sincerely yours.

574
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,170
We will uprise.

575
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,326
An right!

576
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:24,368
Sl I ask, which holy purpose
makes you consider joining to this revolt?

577
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,886
We want Sharia.

578
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,005
Do you want Sharia?

579
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,131
But what you are doing is against the Sharia!
It will help the foreigners!

580
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,244
They abolished the caliphate.

581
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,485
If we don't help the Sheikh, they will totally
erase the name of Islam from our country.

582
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,201
They keep talking about Turkishness Seyda!

583
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,567
They are allays bashing the Kurdish people!

584
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,807
Listen, honorable men.

585
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,565
A mistake cannot be corrected
with another mistake!

586
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,449
Just because someone is making a mistake,
doesn't mean that you have to do the same.

587
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,890
Turks and Kurds are brothers and sisters!

588
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,007
They have been sewing together
to the religion for centuries.

589
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,447
If there are faulty people among them,
go and lam them mildly.

590
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:32,691
The Sharia cannot be saved with actions
against it, with the idea of tribalism!

591
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,603
You cannot achieve anything
with revolt or revolution.

592
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,043
You will just kill the innocent people.
You will cause brothers kill brothers.

593
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:56,449
And you will be slapped
by the opposite of your purpose!

594
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,530
I will not join you!

595
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,331
I will not tight with you against
the descendants of this gallant nation...

596
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,448
...who has served the religion!

597
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,322
In a country, the lar is made with
science and following the right path.

598
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,680
Renounce this purpose.

599
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,569
Tell Sheikh Said that...

600
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,325
...he should also renounce!

601
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,323
How have you been doing?

602
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,809
We struggle.

603
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,962
I struggle a lot, too, brothers.

604
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,651
I lost 9 teeth in the last three months.
I am under a continuous pressure.

605
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:04,962
Iwish I had a craft to lurk and support you.

606
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,845
I am just a hodja.

607
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,762
All I can do is teaching.

608
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,727
I can't provide you a financial relief.

609
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,361
Be patient.

610
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,810
These hard days will be over, with AIIah's willing.

611
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,450
It's a great honor to see you.

612
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,726
It gave us patience.

613
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,962
It strengthen us.

614
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,690
May Allah be with you.

615
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,771
Thanks Seyda. God bless you.

616
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,689
May Allah help you my brothers.

617
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,767
Who are they?

618
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,124
Relatives of rebel Sheikh Said.
Aha, the commander is coming.

619
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,646
-Assalamualaikum.
-Waalaikummussalam, sir.

620
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,970
-Who is he?
-Major.

621
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,763
-Where is he going?
-To hodja's house.

622
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:33,801
God is Almighty. God is Almighty.
(call for prayer in Turkish)

623
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:43,729
Allalruekben Allalruekbed
(call for prayer in Arabic)

624
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,440
-Lailahaillallah!
-Hands up!

625
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,890
Hands up!

626
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,361
Come on.

627
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,961
How dare you, mister soldier?

628
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,127
Banned! It is banned
to call for prayer in Arabic.

629
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,408
Is it also banned inside the mosque?

630
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,650
Your lay of clothing is also banned.

631
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,971
The turban on your head is also banned.

632
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,606
Is the Kurdish Hodja orders you
to do like that?

633
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,242
Son, this is banned, that is banned.
Are we unbelievers huh?

634
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,409
May Allah forbid.

635
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,960
-Yes?
-Move away. We lill make a search.

636
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,203
-What is it, what search?
-Where are the treatises?

637
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,208
Stop, how dare you trespass on my privacy?

638
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,521
You are coming with us
to the police station. Move!

639
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,648
-What station?
-The commander has ordered.

640
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,961
Father! Father!

641
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,081
Move. Move.

642
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,121
Come on, move.

643
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,291
Where do you take us?

644
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,611
Where is our master?

645
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,165
Hodja, we have the orders.

646
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,530
They want you from Isparta.

647
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,530
I las expecting this, Administrator.
I las expecting.

648
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,441
We will keep you in the station
and then set forth in the morning.

649
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,120
So, the time has come.

650
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,522
Then please allow me till the morning.

651
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,606
No, you have to come with us.

652
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,810
Let him stay, Administrator.
l'll put a guard to the door.

653
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,601
Will you?

654
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,124
All right, as it is then.

655
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,091
But, Hodja...

656
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:28,966
...I cannot send you to Isparta like that.
You have to take your turban off and wear a hat.

657
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,362
Listen to me, District Administrator!

658
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,891
I represent your grandfathers!

659
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,042
This turban will only be taken off
together with this head!

660
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,405
They are also forcing me.
I am also an aide.

661
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,366
Then go and say to your superiors
who gave the orders! This is what it is.

662
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,721
All right, hodja.

663
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,404
Go on, lalk.

664
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:28,242
I feel the strikes on the Islam-World
in my own heart first!

665
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,762
Oh our Allah!

666
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,364
I am poor, lonely.

667
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:47,201
I am weak. I have no power.

668
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,450
I say: help.

669
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,802
Oh our Lord!

670
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:07,961
You gave an enormous glory, grandeur
and wealth to the pharaoh...

671
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:13,524
...and his men in their worldly lives.

672
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,529
Was that to deviate your subjects
from your path, our Lord?

673
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,571
Oh our great Lord..

674
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,370
...sweep away their wealth...

675
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,842
...and strongly crush their hearts.

676
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:42,851
Obviously, they will not have faith
unless they don't suffer such a torment.

677
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,490
-I beg for your mercy and help oh Lord!
-Mom, I hear a voice from the roof.

678
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,961
Hodja says Allah.
Hodja recites His name, son.

679
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,207
Lailahaillallah!

680
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,649
Allah makes everything good.
Allah makes everything beautiful.

681
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,321
Lailahaillallah!

682
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,568
Mom it's finished, it's finished!

683
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,203
I will take it to hodja. I will take it to hodja.

684
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,724
Where is hodja?
Where is hodja?

685
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,047
They took hodja away.
They took hodja away. Run, hurry.

686
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,568
Hodja, wait for me.

687
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,085
Hodja, I wrote the book!

688
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,163
Hodja, it is here.

689
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,562
Hodja, I wrote the book!

690
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,406
Are you Sadlk?

691
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,562
Master hodja left this for you.

692
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:21,282
After centuries of struggle, we destroyed
an empire which dominated three continents. Why?

693
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,089
Gentlemen! You know that the states
are established by revolutions...

694
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,566
_.but the civilization needs reforms.

695
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,685
Said is after the reforms, in other lords
after the civilization.

696
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:42,245
The government is administrated
by a certain people with politics.

697
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,806
But the individuals carry the civilization.

698
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,088
That's why Said educates the individuals
who will carry that civilization.

699
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,725
That's why he is not falling
into our trap to commonize him.

700
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,327
He is interested in the individuals one by one.

701
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,203
He stays away from the politics intentionally,
expands his studies to a century...

702
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:09,362
...emphasize allays the future and damages
our plan. This hodja is very clever, really!

703
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:14,170
The man has challenged the world
in a small district like Barla.

704
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,930
I believe it las lise of us
to bring him to Isparta.

705
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,881
Do you call this wise?

706
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,451
We told you to organize an incident in Isparta
such as the one in Menemen...

707
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,609
...but your men messed it up.
Your plot didn't work as you planned.

708
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,922
But this man is a very smart one, sir.

709
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:49,843
He overcame whatever we did.
As if an invisible hand protects him.

710
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:57,364
Due to your orders, we tried to finish him off
on his lay to Eskisehir prison.

711
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,765
You would finish him off,
but hodja finished him off.

712
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:09,325
The captain you sent to kill him became
his student. What kind of a finishing is this?

713
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,047
He is bewitching our men.

714
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:19,128
It didn't work in Kastamonu for 8 years either,
no matter who we sent.

715
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,724
We poisoned him
and it didn't lurk, either. As if...

716
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,689
Don't give me cock-and-bull stories.

717
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,849
Tell me what you are going to do!

718
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,205
Yes, you have arrested him in Kastamonu
because of an article that he wrote.

719
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,124
You put him into the jail in Denizli.
So you proved yourself for a change.

720
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,885
Tell me what we are going to do noi.
What if he is acquitted?

721
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,729
Don't lorry, he will not appear in the court.

722
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,727
How come?

723
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:58,246
We have a very good agent who followed him
since Barla and he knows him very well. ismet.

724
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,611
How many times did you get
arrested, sir?

725
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,400
This time you have been
arrested in military uniform.

726
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:23,809
Sir, what can I say to a brave
commander like yourself who fought in Gallipoli...

727
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,611
...and in the War of Independence,
who has lar medals.

728
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,166
How should I report?

729
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,483
You are a military man, you know such things.

730
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,405
You and I are both officers.
We serve to the government.

731
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,966
I am under pressure, sir.

732
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,609
I have to write my report.

733
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:04,244
As a matter of fact, I'm not a stranger
to your ideas. We, too, have Koran in our house.

734
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,683
Be patient my brother.
Allah willing, a solution will be found.

735
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,725
Give me a clue.
How should I report?

736
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,968
Give me some time.

737
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,965
Guardian! Where are our friends?

738
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,929
What are you doing to them? Guardian!

739
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,804
Where is our master? Guardian!

740
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,524
Guardian! Where is Major Aslm?
Where is the commander?

741
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,691
Hiisrev brother, Mehmet Feyzi brother,
what shall we do now?

742
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,084
My Anam

743
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,401
I don't want to tell lies, my Allah.

744
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:21,600
If I tell the truth, my master and
the service will be suffered.

745
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,330
If l tell lies...

746
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,360
my loyalty, integrity and my martial honor
I kept for 40 years of life will be stained.

747
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,128
Rather than committing such a sin...

748
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,281
...Iwish you take my life my Lord! Amen!

749
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,488
Enough, stop it!

750
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,283
-Shut up and go inside.
-Where is Major Aslm? What did you do to him?

751
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,284
-There is also no sound from our Master!
-Go to your places, that's enough.

752
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,490
What is going on?
Show him to us.

753
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,926
Goto your places.

754
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,411
Enough is enough.

755
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,961
-Don't do it. Stop.
-Just come here.

756
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,850
Do you lant, too?

757
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,960
Stop, don't do it. Stop, don't do it.

758
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,045
Take him up and put back to his bed.

759
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,128
You sacrificed yourself for us, brother.

760
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,641
Iwish you didn't.

761
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:54,130
I can never stand injustice.

762
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,486
Sir. I brought a prayer rug and soup for you.

763
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,961
Sir!

764
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,610
Sir!

765
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,601
Sir!

766
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,927
Sir!

767
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,770
We came from him, and we will turn back to him.

768
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,204
Our brother Aslm became a martyr.

769
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,121
German Land Forces are marching in Russia.

770
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,883
771e German leader Adolf Hit/er
continues to fight in five fronts.

771
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,321
Gaibels, the right hand man nfAdnlfHitler made
a press release about German internal affairs.

772
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,042
Why didn't you tell the guardians who I am?

773
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,242
Mr. ismet wanted so.
So it will be more convincing.

774
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,085
Look at me, huh. I will make a complaint
about you to Mr. lsmet.

775
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,249
Thankfully, I succeeded. Soon they will
go into hodja's lard. I will be one of them.

776
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,209
-Will they accept it?
-Consider it done, warden.

777
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,762
You take care of the parole issue,
and then sit in a corner and latch.

778
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:38,402
The parole is granted. I will tell the guardians.
Ah, I also ordered a meal for you.

779
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,522
See here, you will make them blow
their things up lithout the toilet.

780
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,042
-You are starving them to death.
-OK, fine.

781
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,482
Come in.

782
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,647
Put it over here son.

783
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,362
Here, warden.

784
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:53,847
What is he doing here?

785
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,971
Now we are even.

786
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,647
Come in my friends, come in.

787
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,964
So, how are you today?

788
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:33,086
-Selamiinaleykiim, Master.
-Waalaikummussalam brother Mehmet, Waalaikummussalam.

789
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,961
Master.

790
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,047
Master, this is our famous Ziibeyr brother.

791
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,602
I know. You are Ziibeyr from Konya.

792
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,891
So, you love us that much to snitch yourself
and get into jail eh?

793
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,851
Master I am at your service.

794
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,405
Hodja I am also your admirer.

795
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,609
I know. I know.

796
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,964
Master, our brothers
are very worried about you.

797
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,365
They don't have to lorry Mehmet.
They don't have to lorry.

798
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,964
Saint Yusuf (Joseph)
is the spiritual guide of prisoners.

799
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,162
And this is the Madrasah of Yusuf.

800
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,360
You must be patient.
Don't break your unity and solidarity.

801
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,927
Where is this toilet?
It will blow up.

802
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,121
Be a little patient brothers.

803
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,527
Sit down.

804
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,602
Guardian! Take us out for the toilet!

805
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,929
Here I am.
Why are you shouting?

806
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,884
You will fix it, there.

807
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,841
Hurry up.
These friends are in need. Hurry up.

808
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,528
Why haven't you taken us out
for the toilet for days?

809
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,967
We will burst! Look at us!

810
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,766
From not on, you will do your toilets here.

811
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,682
Are you joking Mister Hasan?

812
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,849
Will you suffocate us in crap huh?
Are we animals?

813
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,369
How can we perform the ablution?
How are we supposed to perform namaz?

814
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,408
Hey, look.

815
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,441
This place will stink!

816
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,885
Why are you shouting at me brother?
This the order of the warden.

817
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,128
Come on.

818
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:40,081
Uh, well, sir. Do you think
we don't get into any trouble for that?

819
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:46,328
Don't you lorry warden,
this is the definitive solution!

820
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,844
This poison is strong enough to kill an elephant.

821
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:07,884
The hodja will never appear in the court!

822
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,841
Now take it.

823
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,130
-Here, brother.
-Hol am I supposed to?

824
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,087
Out of necessity, brother.

825
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,685
But brother, next to you.

826
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,929
We don't have a choice.
Feyzi go nol.

827
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,846
-We will die because of the urine poisoning huh?
-They are poisoning us.

828
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,324
Easy brother, easy.

829
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,848
-Mister Hasan.
-Yes, hodja.

830
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,490
This tea is too much for me.

831
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,090
Can you give this to my brothers?
So that they can drink.

832
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,610
You didn't eat your breakfast hodja.

833
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,601
Go in peace my brother, go in peace.

834
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,045
Hodja sent this
for you to drink.

835
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,251
By the lay, your toilet is very nice.

836
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,248
Our master sent tea for us, lets drink!

837
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,247
ZUbeyL

838
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,722
You have a spy with you.

839
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,046
Be careful with Erdal!

840
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,044
No, no.

841
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,367
No it's not me!

842
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,721
Guardian! Help!

843
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,882
You are poisoning our people
and youth with your writings.

844
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,283
You are preventing us to progress
on our lay to lesternize.

845
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,571
If Divine Light Treatises are poison;
we need tons of that poison.

846
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,246
If mister prosecutor knows
where that poison is...

847
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,688
...he may transfer us by planes to that place!

848
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:32,883
Your honors. Said Nursi, with his books,
turns the people against the government...

849
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,683
...and aims to prevent the reforms
by strengthening the religious linds

850
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,961
And it is very clear that he established
a secret society to realize this aim.

851
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,729
Yes, that's right.
We established a society.

852
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:59,243
A society with 350 million members.
And our leader is Prophet Mohammed.

853
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:09,123
Lt says that you are against all the innovations
such as radio, train, airplane and cinema!

854
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:15,841
We are not against the wonders of the civilization.
These are all blessings.

855
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:21,480
Both radio and cinema are blessings
if they broadcast useful things...

856
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,486
...but they are disasters
if they broadcast deleterious issues.

857
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:30,443
We are establishing a modern world
on our country like the western people.

858
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,969
And you are damaging our world
and peace with your writings.

859
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,968
I have nothing to do to with damaging
neither your world, nor your peace!

860
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,091
My goal and purpose is something different.

861
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,609
Right in front of me, there is an enormous tire,
its flames rising up to the sky.

862
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:54,928
In this tire, my descent is burning,
my faith is set on tire, its burning.

863
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:02,045
I am running to put the Ere out, I am running
for saving my faith. I am telling about Allah.

864
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,364
How dare you!
Your honor, here you see!

865
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,085
He disregards the court!

866
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,131
Who do you trust
to speak so reckless!

867
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,121
You are insulting the Supreme Court
when you say 'you are not my addressee'!

868
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,281
Who do you trust?

869
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,965
To this and to Allah!

870
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,361
We are trusting to our shrouds!
To our shrouds.

871
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,727
Bismillah is the beginning of every charity.

872
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,210
We too start with it at the beginning.

873
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:39,130
Know oh my soul, this holy lord is the mark of
Islam. And it is what all the existing creatures...

874
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,089
_.recite it in their own language.

875
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:49,201
If you want to understand what an endless power,
how is an unending blessing the Bismillah is...

876
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,364
...listen to this figurative story!

877
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:54,968
Here it is:

878
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,885
A man making a journey through the
deserts of Arabia...

879
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:06,843
has to travel in the name of a tribal chief
and enter under his protection.

880
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:12,401
So he maybe saved from the bandits
and secure his needs.

881
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,370
We said at the beginning:

882
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:21,970
All the existing creatures recite
Bismillah in their own languages.

883
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,247
Right?

884
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:28,524
Mister Said. The prosecutor claims that
you are the enemy of the republic.

885
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,844
What do you think about the republic?

886
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:37,282
Your honor.
They asked the same question in Eski§ehir court.

887
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:45,126
My history in that rile proves
that I am a religious republican.

888
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,848
The deceased pasha knew that, too.

889
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,164
Your honors!

890
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:56,127
We are accused of exploiting
the religion and breaking the order.

891
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,804
You too know that this is a lie.

892
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,522
I am trying to direct people
to Allah and Koran.

893
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:08,689
Can such people break the order?

894
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,765
For tlenty years, thousands of people
have read my writings and found peace.

895
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,489
They never broke the order.

896
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:26,084
The secret blasphemous committee
wants to destroy us...

897
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,601
...by abusing the members of the government,
and by misleading the justice.

898
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:37,603
If the truth is so, then we will tell them
with all our power that:

899
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:43,648
You miserables who sell their religion
for the world! Do what you can!

900
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:50,167
May the world be your demise.
And it will be!

901
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:59,565
If we have millions of heads,
they are all worth sacrificing on this lay.

902
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,570
We are ready for every punishment
and your death penalties!

903
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,647
Do you have any additional things to say?
Is this your last lord?

904
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,201
My last lord:
'Hasbunallah wa ni'mal wakil.'

905
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,249
Allah is enough for us.
He is the most beautiful attorney.

906
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:27,808
Your honor! Excuse me, this is the time
for namaz. I will perform the namaz.

907
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,325
No lay! This is against the regulations.
You can perform your lapsed pray later on!

908
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,529
No! No Iapsing,
I will perform my namaz!

909
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,961
You can't!

910
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:43,045
Mister prosecutor!
We are here to defend namaz!

911
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,930
That's all we are accused of.

912
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,848
I have to confess that this is the
hardest case in my professional life.

913
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,167
We should be fair in our decision.

914
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,683
You know the expert's opinion
from Ankara.

915
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,725
What do you think about it?

916
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,680
I consider him guilty.

917
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,722
My fellow judge had the same opinion
but he is sick.

918
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,928
Only if if he didn't change his mind later on.

919
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,931
His treatment is extended,
so he lon't be coming for a long time.

920
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,845
I commissioned Mrs. Asll for the duty.
She is examining the file.

921
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,089
In that case, her opinion
will be decisive.

922
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,328
Yes?

923
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,764
-Welcome Mrs. Ash.
-Thank you sir.

924
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,124
I read the expert's report and the files.
I examined the case and gave my decision.

925
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,686
Here it is.

926
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,966
Per curiam!

927
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:49,202
The evidences presented to our court and the
expertise report sent from Ankara...

928
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,045
...have been carefully examined
and we arrived at a verdict.

929
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:59,530
The expert group has determined that there is no
element of crime in the books...

930
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,127
...called Treaties of Divine Light
as a result of their detailed investigation.

931
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:09,169
And our court committee has decided that the
evidences presented by the prosecution...

932
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,086
...don't qualify to prove
the claimed crimes...

933
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:18,201
...and it has been unanimously decided
to dismiss the charges.

934
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:20,444
Shame on you!

935
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,686
With all the means we provided you,
you just couldn't succeed it.

936
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:30,045
But sir, I included my statement
in the expert report, sir.

937
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,964
You are dismissed. Out!

938
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:44,811
How come we can't handle
one single person! After all he is just a man!

939
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:51,684
But a man who doesn't bow to anybody.

940
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,126
They call him Free Man!

941
01:32:53,520 --> 01:33:01,769
He doesn't listen to anyone, he doesn't accept
any offer and he is not afraid of anything.

942
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,250
Remember all the things we offered him.

943
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:10,771
Properties, goods, money!
But he didn't accept any of them.

944
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:18,242
He thinks that he is free, but we will teach him
to live in captivity as a free person.

945
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:22,049
His freedom will be very distasteful.

946
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,960
Where is he now?

947
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:33,690
-He is on parole. In Emirda§.
-So he is in Emirda§ (Order-Mountain)!

948
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,930
He will see if it is Emirdagj (Order-mountain)
or Demirdagj (Iron-mountain)!

949
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,371
Hodja, this mosque is locked.

950
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,851
Everywhere in the world is a mosque
for a Muslim, brother.

951
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,200
At this rate, Hitler will finish the Russians.

952
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,967
Russia is a slamp, mister mayor.
I think Germans are committing suicide.

953
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:02,928
Stop, stop!

954
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,530
What is the man doing? How dare he?

955
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:15,808
Let him, mister mayor. He is harmless.

956
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,169
Is this a place for prayers?
Prayers should be performed in the mosque.

957
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,846
Mister mayor.
This is the hodja that we are waiting.

958
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:28,328
Oh! So this is the man Ankara
has been hassling for years.

959
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,607
We run into big trouble.

960
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,560
Welcome, hodja.

961
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,130
Thank you.

962
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,922
I am the doctor of the town
and also Housing Director Tahir.

963
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,361
I am responsible from
your health and housing.

964
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,887
We want to help you settle.
Would you like to stay in a hotel or in a house?

965
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,288
-House.
-All right.

966
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,887
We have a house,
but you will have a drunkard neighbor.

967
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,843
It's better than staying alone in a hotel.

968
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,449
May Allah give you good customers.

969
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,246
Bless you. May Allah be pleased with you.

970
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,645
You have a guest Hasan!

971
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,088
-A guest?
-He will reside upstairs.

972
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,446
-Please, hodja!
-Selamiinaleykiim! May it be easy.

973
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,046
-Waalaikummussalam. Welcome!
-Thank you.

974
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:27,084
That's fine you brought him here,
but I hope he Ion't be uncomfortable from me?

975
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,966
Please, hodja.

976
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,966
We have to leave, hodja.

977
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,089
Thank you brothers.
May Allah be pleased with you.

978
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,246
After you, hodja.

979
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:15,042
This room witnessed some bloodshed.
It has been locked for years.

980
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:18,326
They call it the Death Room.

981
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,726
Mehmet!

982
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:45,961
Master.

983
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,051
Mehmet! My dear Mehmet.

984
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,369
My brother.

985
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:01,684
Didn't I tell you to goto your life and children?

986
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,322
It's worth the sacrifice my wife
and my children for you, master.

987
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,530
You are my everything.
I didn't forget my father's lill.

988
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,210
My dear Mehmet.

989
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:22,241
Come. Come. Sit.

990
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,891
Come brother, let's take the other lay.

991
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:59,281
Master, Afyon Governor and Chief of Police
visited Emirda§ 5 times...

992
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:03,081
...and Chief Public Prosecutor visited
2 times in the last 10 days.

993
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,083
What do they want from us, master?

994
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,483
Master! Duck, my master!

995
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,285
Don't be afraid my brother, stand up!

996
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,490
The fate is unique and will not be changed!

997
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,888
What do they want from us, master?

998
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:32,286
My Brother. They are preparing a trap
10 times bigger than Sheikh Said...

999
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:39,050
...and Menemen incidents.
But we will not fall into this trap!

1000
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,206
My Allah.

1001
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:50,206
For the one who knows you,
a dungeon is a palace...

1002
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,444
...for the one who doesn't know you,
even a palace is a dungeon.

1003
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:14,804
...and for the one who doesn't know you,
a palace is a dungeon.

1004
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,800
My brothers.

1005
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:29,484
The one who knows Allah is in a palace
and happy even if in a dungeon.

1006
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:38,526
And the who doesn't know him is in a dungeon
and unhappy even if in a palace.

1007
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,803
The one who finds Allah, finds everything.

1008
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:52,529
Bismillah is the beginning of each and every charity

1009
01:39:53,720 --> 01:40:02,287
Since everything spiritually says Bismillah,
we too should begin with it.

1010
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:08,965
We have to give, in the name of Allah.
We have to take, in the name of Allah.

1011
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:17,204
We have to love in the name of Allah.
We have to hate in the name of Allah.

1012
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,731
Hey you, stop.

1013
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,528
What are you doing with the Kurdish hodja?

1014
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,609
It's forbidden fellows, forbidden!

1015
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:34,924
We have to find another house for our master and
take him away from this poisonous workshop.

1016
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,811
It's obvious that they put
him here to be poisoned and die.

1017
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,565
-Assalamualaikum.
-Waalaikummussalam, brother.

1018
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,449
I brought you tea, hodja.

1019
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:10,571
Thank you.

1020
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,803
Don't revere me, brother!
Revere Allah!

1021
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:31,251
Hodja, what do they want from you?
How can you endure such pressure?

1022
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:40,686
My nature does not tolerate the vileness
and indignity mister Hasan.

1023
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:49,806
There were times I wished to die
rather than living.

1024
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:54,046
If my religion did not forbid to commit suicide...

1025
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,530
...maybe this Said would have been
under the ground and had already faded away.

1026
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,806
For the faith of the society
and millions of Turkish children...

1027
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,125
...not even one Said but thousands of
Saids may be sacrificed.

1028
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:19,886
This is the secret of my patience mister Hasan.

1029
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,409
I better go now, hodja.

1030
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,931
Hodja.

1031
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:32,247
I rented a new store. I will move.

1032
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:36,925
Will you allow me to visit you time to time?

1033
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,641
What is it, brother?
Why you are moving?

1034
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:48,683
Our profession is noisy, dirty and smoky.
I don't want to disturb you any longer.

1035
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,526
Stop!

1036
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,163
Don't enter in! Where are you going?

1037
01:43:22,801 --> 01:43:26,283
Don't you know what a restriction is?
Put them into jail!

1038
01:43:31,441 --> 01:43:33,443
Lock the door.

1039
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,562
We have orders, hodja.

1040
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,769
You are under house arrest.
From not on it is forbidden for you to go out!

1041
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,331
Is this a communist country?

1042
01:43:46,481 --> 01:43:49,769
Why are you arresting the hodja in the house?
Did he cause any harm to anyone?

1043
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,400
Is this veteran fought
against the Russians for that?

1044
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,051
Do you think you really did a good thing?

1045
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:23,884
We are also sorry for your situation!
But we are aides, too.

1046
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:29,805
Our mosques are all clean.
We have Turkish hodjas in them.

1047
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,886
Go and perform your prayers in there.

1048
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:36,803
How can you perform your prayers
in a lhitesmith-store!

1049
01:44:38,641 --> 01:44:43,044
What have you got to do with that Kurdish hodja?

1050
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,846
We are Muslim, too.

1051
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:51,723
This country belongs to all of us.
I will let you free.

1052
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:59,170
But I don't want to see you anymore
with that stranger! Understand?

1053
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,283
Is that clear?

1054
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:18,122
My brothers, I am under an unnecessary
pressure and cruelty. I suffer an enormous ordeal.

1055
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:23,523
They luck my house
both from inside and outside.

1056
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:32,923
I am lonely in all senses. I am living my life
as a sick man in a boring room, without neighbors.

1057
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,608
We have to reach to our master somehow.

1058
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:39,127
-Assalamualaikum.
-Waalaikummussalam.

1059
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:41,603
My name is Mehmet. I am shopkeeper.

1060
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:45,442
They call me the Hard-Worker around here.
This is my son Ceylan.

1061
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,441
My name is Mehmet, too.
This is our brother Ziibeyr.

1062
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,604
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello, hello.

1063
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,444
We also want to see the hodja.

1064
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:13,611
Sometimes, one day here suffocates me
more than one month in prison at Denizli.

1065
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:22,924
It? enough that they have prevented my freedom
and liberty lith such a horrible cruelty...

1066
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,605
...fur 20 years.

1067
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:33,401
Is it too much to ask for the freedom
everybody has? Your brother Said.

1068
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:46,047
Allah makes everything good.
Allah...

1069
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,249
Master! Master!
What happened to you?

1070
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,687
Master.

1071
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,328
-My brothers.
-Is he poisoned again?

1072
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:00,722
They haven't given me bread
or later for 15 days.

1073
01:47:06,801 --> 01:47:09,202
Master, we brought some food for you!
My name is Ceylan.

1074
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,209
Fifteen days.

1075
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,250
Bismillah.

1076
01:47:38,801 --> 01:47:42,726
Master, I fix radios.
People always ask me.

1077
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:45,042
They ask if a Muslim should fix radios.

1078
01:47:45,521 --> 01:47:48,001
They say that I help people listen to songs.

1079
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:57,810
My brother. You are acquiring
merits for all the Koran letters come out...

1080
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:04,320
...from every radio you fixed.
A man can say good lords and the bad lords.

1081
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:09,481
Should we cut out the mouth
in case of a bad word?

1082
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:15,682
From not on lets print the treatises not
in Arabic script, but in Latin script.

1083
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:21,086
No master. We shouldn't change the Arabic script
le've been using for a thousand years.

1084
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,011
Now they teach
the Latin script in schools.

1085
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:30,124
All the correspondences, magazines, newspapers
are in Latin script.

1086
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,000
We are minority nol.

1087
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,723
People who can read the Arabic script
have decreased.

1088
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:37,767
But master...

1089
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:43,684
Don't move! Everybody stand up!

1090
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,887
Up!

1091
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:56,049
How could you enter in even though
we sealed the door? Did you dig a tunnel huh?

1092
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,962
Chief! We found the secret entrance!
They dug a hole on the la!! and entered Chief!

1093
01:49:04,561 --> 01:49:06,723
Mister Doctor, you too?

1094
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,481
What do you think?

1095
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:12,564
Take them all into the jail except Hodja!

1096
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,408
Take the doctor to the mayor! Hurry up!

1097
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,610
But this is ridiculous Doctor!
How can you join them?

1098
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,968
He is a reactionary! A reactionary!

1099
01:49:43,601 --> 01:49:47,447
Mayor, how can a man who has acquitted from
various courts be a reactionary?

1100
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:52,565
This hodja is not an enemy of our homeland
or enemy of the sate. He is a republican.

1101
01:49:56,440 --> 01:50:00,047
If Ankara Iasn't scared so much, would they
continuously request information from us?

1102
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:06,044
I have been to many conversations with him.
All he tells us is to believe in Allah...

1103
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:09,568
...to read a lot, be a honest person,
and to achieve wealth by working hard.

1104
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:13,405
He feels very sorry
for the ignorance of our people.

1105
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,410
Have you ever read what he had written?

1106
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:21,323
Yes, I have. He wants unification, and
he wants brotherhood. But they don't let him.

1107
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,442
Who do they think we are?

1108
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,608
We govern not only Turkey, but the whole world.

1109
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,441
We created a hero out of him.

1110
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,169
The more we strike, the more he grows.

1111
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:43,963
I am afraid he will take the army
and the state on his side.

1112
01:50:44,401 --> 01:50:47,405
He has students from military officers
and parliament members.

1113
01:50:49,521 --> 01:50:52,172
It is time to change our policy.

1114
01:50:54,400 --> 01:51:02,330
We will not touch him anymore.
In other words, we will forget him.

1115
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,681
But sir, how come?

1116
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,448
If we forget him, then everyone does.

1117
01:51:45,521 --> 01:51:47,728
Your house arrest is over, hodja.

1118
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,091
Hodja left the house!
Hodja left the house!

1119
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:58,930
Mayor asked a bribe from me!

1120
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,050
Mayor asked a bribe from me!

1121
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:09,484
Brothers, this is the fate
of the tyrants who take bribes.

1122
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,526
Our master asks for you.

1123
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:44,208
Look mister officer.
Being a policeman is a very important duty.

1124
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:51,245
He prevents unjustice,
he protects the aggrieved ones.

1125
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:56,442
He saves the properties and honor of the people.

1126
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:03,366
You are the physical guards of this nation,
and we are the spiritual guards.

1127
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:07,806
Together, we serve to the order of our nation.

1128
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:15,007
Hodja, all the things they say
about you confuse me.

1129
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,283
They say that you are an enemy of the republic.

1130
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:24,325
And...

1131
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,889
...they say that you are a reactionary.

1132
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:31,005
They even say that you insulted the Pasha.

1133
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:37,081
Did you really see him?

1134
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,048
I mean the Pasha, did you speak with him?

1135
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,884
Listen brother.

1136
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:50,722
After the victory,
Pasha invited me to Ankara.

1137
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:58,962
He offered me a mansion, a farm and ten thousand
Iiras as salary for working together with him.

1138
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,531
I didn't accept the offer.

1139
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:07,805
I said, 'My duty ends there.
The nation should have everything.'

1140
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,482
Congratulations for your
your speech in congress, hodja.

1141
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:16,884
Especially your lords on science
and knowledge grabbed my attention.

1142
01:55:17,681 --> 01:55:22,767
Pasha, the mind is satisfied with sciences.

1143
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:26,129
And the soul is satisfied
with religious knowledge.

1144
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:30,242
When these two come together the truth emerges.

1145
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,368
CHAMBER OF SPEAKER OF THE CONGRESS
ANKARA 1922

1146
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:36,241
Mental and physical progress
is the greatest power today

1147
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:40,765
Because the Europeans are crushing us
with their mental pressure...

1148
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:44,003
...powered by their
weapons of science and industry.

1149
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:49,645
That's why we must tight through science and arts
against ignorance, poverty, and conflict...

1150
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:57,970
...which are the most powerful enemies of
spreading the unity of Allah.

1151
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,121
Hodja, I admire your struggle,
your attitude and honesty.

1152
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:12,404
We will make some reforms.
And we need your support while doing so.

1153
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:18,050
For example we want to ease off the issues
such as alcohol and dressing code.

1154
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:29,445
Neither the authority
nor the promises of Allah will ever change.

1155
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,408
These gospels are the biggest happiness.

1156
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:38,083
He is the one who gave the earth
to your command...

1157
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:43,361
...for you to lalk on it with justice
and eat the food Allah provides.

1158
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:52,770
Pasha! Pasha! Make reforms on science and art,
but to don't try to ease of! Koran's orders!

1159
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:56,085
We allays need a brave hodja like yourself.

1160
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,849
We invited you here
to benefit from your high ideas.

1161
01:57:02,961 --> 01:57:05,089
Hodja! Hodja!

1162
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:08,882
I respect you since the day
you spoke in Thessalonica.

1163
01:57:10,001 --> 01:57:13,369
Don't interfere to our reforms. Live free!

1164
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:35,410
I saw confusion in Ankara.

1165
01:57:36,881 --> 01:57:43,002
A new generation must be educated
for the faith of this nation.

1166
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:49,605
Oh, hodja. I am under command and pressure.
Please try to understand my position.

1167
01:57:51,601 --> 01:57:55,526
I don't want to follow you, either.
Do you think I enjoy it?

1168
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:04,087
Oh hodja. Besides, do you know that
my grandfather is an Alaii Sheikh.

1169
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:08,523
We are brothers.

1170
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:14,241
I honestly love the true Alalis and
our esteemed master Ali.

1171
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:20,890
Our master Ali could perform his morning prayer
with his evening ablution.

1172
01:58:21,361 --> 01:58:25,207
He las very sensitive about the praying.

1173
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:30,490
Ah by hodja, please.
Do not strive with this order, leave it!

1174
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:32,326
Brother!

1175
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,326
My 30 years of struggle is about...

1176
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:40,761
...giving answers to European philosophers
who are working in the name of irreligion.

1177
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:48,650
This Pasha. What has he said
15 days before he died?

1178
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:50,447
Read it.

1179
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:57,729
He sent this message
to all the Muslims in the world.

1180
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:04,562
Moreover he announced this via Prime Ministry
and Foreign Affairs channels.

1181
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:13,526
All Muslims should follow the path
that the last Prophet Mohammed showed...

1182
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,289
...and should practice his instructions.

1183
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:24,681
All the Muslims should take Prophet Mohammed
as a model and act as he did.

1184
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,680
They should obey the orders of Islam
as they are.

1185
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:34,162
Because people can only survive
and develop in this lay.

1186
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:36,126
He shouldn't have said that.

1187
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:41,009
The reactionaries can take courage from this
and they can queer our pitch.

1188
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:47,086
Cover this up immediately.
Also inform the queen.

1189
01:59:48,721 --> 01:59:50,371
Write, my brother Mehmet!

1190
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:56,241
To the Members of the Parliament, to the
Prime Minister, to the President of the Republic.

1191
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:04,169
Gentlemen. Our mission is
to strengthen the people's faith.

1192
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:13,569
To live fraternally, without discriminating
the friend and the enemy, and without partisanship.

1193
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,850
Write, my brother Ceylan.

1194
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:22,247
To Chief Rabbinate, To Vatican Pontificate.

1195
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:26,360
In this recent times; we the Christians,
Jews and Muslims should put aside...

1196
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:39,924
...our controversies
and we have to join forces...

1197
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:43,926
...against our common enemies such as
immorality, irreligion and depravation.

1198
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:48,001
We have to be unified and act together
on the path of Allah.

1199
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,282
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1200
02:00:51,761 --> 02:00:54,241
My valuable, loyal, gallant brothers...

1201
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,291
...being friends with great nation such as
America which works for the religion...

1202
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:04,322
...can only be achieved
by faith and Islam.

1203
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:10,007
We, as the servers of Koran,
declare this to them and we also pray...

1204
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:13,084
...for their success at sewing Islam.

1205
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,165
Allah's willing.

1206
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:17,446
An mighty Aman.

1207
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:20,367
An mighty Aman.

1208
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:28,530
Bismillah is the beginning of each and every charity
We, too start with it. Know oh my soul.

1209
02:01:29,521 --> 02:01:30,363
Ismet.

1210
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,931
You lost yourself.

1211
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:37,765
Please collect yourself a little.
Look, we are here.

1212
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,606
-My dear father, welcome.
-Leave me alone.

1213
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:45,209
I don't feel good. I don't.
I spent my life for the government.

1214
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,842
I helped them catch hundreds of
enemies of the state.

1215
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:52,205
But they chucked me out when I am finished.
I don't feel good.

1216
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:58,967
Hello.

1217
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,880
It is for you.

1218
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:08,886
This old man lent too far.

1219
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:15,407
He wrote a letter to the parliament members,
commissioners, to ambassadors.

1220
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:19,567
He even wrote to the Pope.
How dare he!

1221
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:23,202
This men is not establishing a state,
but an emperorship.

1222
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:25,563
We shouldn't have left him alone.

1223
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,046
Please.

1224
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:38,601
Come in.

1225
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:43,886
Ismet.

1226
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,367
Good afternoon sir.

1227
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,366
Good afternoon.

1228
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:52,604
Do you think
you will succeed this time?

1229
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:53,922
Yes sir.

1230
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,685
So, what are you planning to do?

1231
02:03:10,961 --> 02:03:13,487
The prosecutor started an investigation
about Saidi Nursi.

1232
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:16,246
7 cult members were caught yesterday
during rituals.

1233
02:03:16,401 --> 02:03:18,210
Saidi Nursi incident is spreading.

1234
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,442
An reactionary organization is found out

1235
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,729
3 cult members in Ankara
and 1 cult members in inebolu is arrested.

1236
02:03:28,881 --> 02:03:30,007
Your honor.

1237
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:35,250
You brought a lot of people here because of me,
and you are trying them.

1238
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:40,450
Who brought them? Who brought them?

1239
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,845
Did they steal anything?

1240
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:48,207
Did they kill someone,
abduct a girl...

1241
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:52,251
...overthrow the government? What did they do?

1242
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:59,605
Where are the witnesses? You brought
all these innocent people with lies and untruths.

1243
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,688
Don't they have children?

1244
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,567
Now who will provide their living?

1245
02:04:06,641 --> 02:04:09,565
Who will pay for the harm
those fatherless children got?

1246
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:14,728
Will you be testifying for them
beyond the veil?

1247
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:17,648
I'm warning you!

1248
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,448
Do not fight with Divine Light's Treatises
which is based on Koran.

1249
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:24,890
It cannot be defeated.

1250
02:04:25,841 --> 02:04:30,369
Ifl had many heads as much
as the hairs on my head...

1251
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:35,483
...even if you decapitate one of them each day,
they may be sacrificed for the truths of Koran.

1252
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,410
I will not bow to blasphemy and irreligionl

1253
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:45,081
I will never give up my duty for the faith!

1254
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:54,521
With Allah's willing, this court lill break
the plans and attacks of our secret enemies.

1255
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:59,050
Mister Hodja, tell us,
how many students do you have?

1256
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:04,841
You turn the entire Afyon City into a prison
and I will tell you.

1257
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,926
Hodja hodja! Why don't you mind
your own business at this age!

1258
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:12,648
Are you responsible from people's faith or Koran?

1259
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:15,242
Why do you care?
Go and live your life!

1260
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:23,370
Faith is a divine light, a power.
I'm willing to burn in the flames of hell...

1261
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:28,127
...If I'm going to see that
the people's faith is secured.

1262
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:33,049
Because my soul will be in a bed of roses
when my body burns in flames.

1263
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:39,000
I have no desire for the paradise
nor the fear of hell.

1264
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:44,491
So, are you challenging
the court and justice?

1265
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:45,922
No!

1266
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:54,120
I have trust to the loyalty of court members
for the justice, and also to justice itself!

1267
02:05:54,481 --> 02:05:55,767
My lords...

1268
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:59,402
Defendant Mullah Said. Stand up!

1269
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:02,561
Why doesn't he talk?

1270
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:05,362
Because he can't End anything to say.

1271
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:12,810
You are tried for your life with the charges
to cause the events on 31st March...

1272
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,726
...by your provocative articles
on Volkan newspaper...

1273
02:06:16,881 --> 02:06:22,251
...and by various social movements
that you organized.

1274
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:27,608
Oh you pashas, officers!

1275
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,089
My purpose is to save
the constitution from the defect...

1276
02:06:32,241 --> 02:06:34,972
...to save the religious people from the despair...

1277
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:43,250
...and in the eyes of history, to save the people
of this century from ignorance and madness...

1278
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:44,811
...from anxieties and doubts!

1279
02:06:45,361 --> 02:06:48,331
So you have demanded Sharia
like others. Is that so?

1280
02:06:48,640 --> 02:06:55,000
Yes! I want Sharia, too.
But, not like the revolutionists want!

1281
02:06:55,921 --> 02:07:01,849
Ifl had thousands of souls, I am ready
to sacrifice them all for a single truth of Sharia!

1282
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:07,601
Because Sharia means justice, honesty, virtue!

1283
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:16,167
And you have provoked the people, the students,
the officers and the porters to revolt.

1284
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:23,769
On the contrary! I directed them from revolt
to obedience with all my speeches and articles!

1285
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:26,567
Really?

1286
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,366
Look. Look outside.

1287
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:36,006
You may end next to them.

1288
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:46,323
I lived freely on the east mountains of Kurdistan.

1289
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:50,325
Your menaces will not affect me!

1290
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:54,727
No! My son is not a bandit.

1291
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:57,769
He will never hurt any living creature.

1292
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:05,331
He is a great gallant, famous scholar respected
by the eastern clans and scholars!

1293
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:08,725
You are tyrannizing to such a hero.

1294
02:08:09,201 --> 02:08:13,365
Your honor!
Justice! Justice!

1295
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:18,765
Rule with the justice, don't tyrannize!

1296
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:22,763
Sit down old man.
I don't understand even a lord that you say.

1297
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,729
Father, don't lorry.

1298
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:31,604
Allah have justice.

1299
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:34,640
You cannot horrify me with death!

1300
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:41,091
I prefer to die tyrannized
rather than be a tyrant!

1301
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:48,162
I will gladly depart to afterlife
from the station of gallows...

1302
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,926
...with the execution passport
that you will give me.

1303
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:03,363
Long live hell for the tyrants!

1304
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:11,007
-Long live hell for the tyrants!
-Long live hell for the tyrants!

1305
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:14,846
Long live hell for the tyrants!

1306
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,685
Long live hell for the tyrants!

1307
02:09:20,881 --> 02:09:22,804
We are listening to you Mister Hodja.

1308
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:28,405
My lords, your honor,
isn't directed to yourself or the judges...

1309
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:35,209
...but to the secret godless committee
who try to manipulate the court and abuse it!

1310
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:41,729
And to the obsequious people
who betray this nation.

1311
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:52,126
With Allah's willing, this court lill break
the plans and attacks of our secret enemies.

1312
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:56,206
Verdict.

1313
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:05,967
Allah makes everything good.
Allah makes everything beautiful.

1314
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:17,322
Allah makes everything good.
Allah makes everything beautiful.

1315
02:10:26,481 --> 02:10:30,008
Hit. Hit. Hit.

1316
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:39,563
Look, you tell us the truth and le'll set you free.

1317
02:10:40,561 --> 02:10:41,687
What do you say?

1318
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:48,963
My brothers! Let's try to endure
and not shout so loudly.

1319
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:52,529
Our voices shouldn't reach to
our master and torment him!

1320
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,167
Hit. Hit. Hit stronger.

1321
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:02,765
Enough! He will die.

1322
02:11:02,961 --> 02:11:03,803
Stop it.

1323
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:07,491
Where did you hide the weapons?

1324
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:09,922
You have weapons don't you? Speak up.

1325
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,650
We have... We have...

1326
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:18,725
He is confessing.
Write it down, write.

1327
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,162
What kind of weapons do you have?

1328
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:27,686
Which are destroying the ignorance,
illuminating the darkness.

1329
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:32,723
We have weapons which are challenging against
all the tyrants of the world.

1330
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,445
We have nuclear bombs.

1331
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:43,561
He is making fun of us! Nuclear bomb, huh!
Nuclear bomb. Nuclear bomb.

1332
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:45,563
Hit. Hit.

1333
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,040
Long live hell for the tyrants.

1334
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:54,566
Oh you miserable ones who burden me!

1335
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:59,725
I don't care whatever you do to me!

1336
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:02,921
The cruelties that you unlawfully committ...

1337
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:12,446
...the pressures which touch my veins
terrorize everyone but enrages me.

1338
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:16,201
But it has been warned into my heart...

1339
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:23,530
...'Don't rage against these tyrants
but pity them, because they lill be...

1340
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:29,446
...subjected to hellish tortures physically
and mentally for the cruelties they have committed.

1341
02:12:30,961 --> 02:12:36,684
Your revenge will be taken
from them thousand times!

1342
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:46,288
They will have deadly qualms of conscience
as long as they live!

1343
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:11,241
Even though the windows of hodja's lard
were broken, he didn't freeze.

1344
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,880
Sir, please come.

1345
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,122
Have a look.

1346
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:34,329
Even that we applied too much pressure,
we couldn't make them talk.

1347
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:38,688
They didn't talk but they have cringed,
look at them.

1348
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:41,082
I don't think so sir.

1349
02:13:42,001 --> 02:13:45,005
Continue to torture, warden!
Keep the pressure.

1350
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:48,721
They will be scared! They will be really scared
and they will say everything!

1351
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:19,724
Come on hodja, you are lucky again.

1352
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,566
Salt dealer Avni from Afyon has sent these to you.

1353
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:34,721
Since I don't accept any presents,
I lon't also take them. Give them back.

1354
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:27,009
Brothers. Stand straight. Be gladsome.

1355
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:42,606
It's time to end this.

1356
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,967
Hodja, you have to be inoculated.

1357
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,809
Open your arm hodja.

1358
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:38,167
-H ere.
-It is for your own health, hodja.

1359
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:46,642
-Get well hodja.
-For your own health hodja.

1360
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:30,565
Oh Healer oh Allah!

1361
02:17:35,921 --> 02:17:38,322
Oh Healer oh Allah.

1362
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:43,891
Oh Healer...

1363
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:45,360
...oh Allah.

1364
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:54,727
Oh Healer oh Allah!

1365
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:59,407
Oh Healer oh Allah!

1366
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:43,651
Oh Healer oh Allah!

1367
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:47,325
Please heal me, Allah!

1368
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:04,290
Mother. Mother.

1369
02:19:05,521 --> 02:19:08,684
Mother. Mother.

1370
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:12,522
Mother.

1371
02:19:12,881 --> 02:19:15,851
BEKiR AGHA WARD- iSTANBUL 1909

1372
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:17,601
Said.

1373
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:32,767
Will they execute you my son?

1374
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:36,766
What will I do if you die, My Said?

1375
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:41,644
The hawk of the Eastern Mountains, my gallant son!

1376
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:44,688
I am proud of you.

1377
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:50,082
The truth will always lin.

1378
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:56,570
My son. Your mother may die for you.

1379
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:59,721
I missed you too much my son!

1380
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:06,210
Look what I brought for you.

1381
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:10,924
This is the oregano of our mountains.

1382
02:20:13,480 --> 02:20:14,970
I know you like it.

1383
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:17,681
And this is the soil of our village.

1384
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,050
It is very cold.

1385
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,766
Please take care of yourself huh?

1386
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,366
My Said.

1387
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:38,290
My Said do not forget! You are a man of struggle!

1388
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:49,525
My struggle.

1389
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:00,731
My struggle, my struggle.

1390
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:04,326
Uncle Hodja! Uncle Hodja,
what happened to you?

1391
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:06,844
Mehmed! Ziibeyr?

1392
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:08,481
It's me, Bayram.

1393
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,487
Brother, I am dying.

1394
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:16,851
My master, my master, what happened?

1395
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,728
-Don't leave us my master, please!
-My brothers, they poisoned me again.

1396
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:23,325
Damn with them, master!

1397
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:26,600
I am dying! Dying!

1398
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,770
Guardian! Come on!

1399
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:31,966
Cravens! They have poisoned our master!

1400
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,049
Where is the doctor?
Master is dying!

1401
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:35,167
Guardian!

1402
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:10,409
Brothers! I am very ill,
perhaps I lon't survive.

1403
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:14,920
All my existence may be sacrificed for motherland,
nation, youth, the Islam lorld...

1404
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:34,811
...for the happiness
and welfare of the human!

1405
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:41,962
If I die, may my friends
not take my revenge!

1406
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:51,284
You will endure some troubles
but it will end all good.

1407
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:04,249
-Long live my master!
-Get well my master.

1408
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:17,125
Allah makes everything good.
Allah makes everything beautiful.

1409
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:24,322
Get well, my master.

1410
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:32,205
Here, master.

1411
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:36,846
I had promised you.

1412
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:41,441
I am Sadlk, master. Sadlk.

1413
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:45,084
Sadlk. Shepherd Sadlk!

1414
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:49,608
I missed you very much, master. Very much.

1415
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:12,089
Hodja has survived again.
Hodja is free again.

1416
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,685
There is something in this system.
There is something in this system.

1417
02:25:23,880 --> 02:25:25,086
Hello.

1418
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,328
It's for you, sir.

1419
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:31,927
Yes?

1420
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:39,684
Mr. ismet, welcome.

1421
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:43,328
Please wait for a while.
The president is here but he has a foreign visitor.

1422
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,971
Please take a seat.
l'll bring you a cup of coffee.

1423
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:55,051
Friends. Now I will tell you
the new world order.

1424
02:25:56,560 --> 02:26:00,884
You were the rulers in Asia, Europe and Africa.

1425
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:03,322
But you couldn't succeed.

1426
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:07,883
The queen of the empire
on which the sun never sets, is finished.

1427
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:13,126
That's why we are taking over
the new world order.

1428
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:18,041
We will not establish this new order
on bans and threats like you did...

1429
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:26,961
...but on cooperation basis.
We care a lot about Turkey.

1430
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,807
This place has a history of emperorship.

1431
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:35,321
We have to lurk lith the public
especially to prevent any more heroes.

1432
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:39,965
The Ottoman spirit should never lake up.

1433
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:46,649
The people of this country must allays
consider themselves helpless.

1434
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:49,451
They must allays be dependent to us.

1435
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:55,922
But sir. This hodja is not an ordinary person.
He is like Gandhi of India.

1436
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:04,161
Gandhi collaborated with us.
Now he establishes his government.

1437
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:14,571
Mister ismet?

1438
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:17,765
Mister ismet Ihat's wrong?

1439
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:12,129
Welcome hodja, welcome.

1440
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:18,046
Assalamualaikum.

1441
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:19,851
Waalaikummussalam.

1442
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:24,763
Hodja, welcome hodja. Welcome

1443
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,050
Thank you Sevket.

1444
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:32,047
Hodja, not I'm your student, too.

1445
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:39,842
Hello. Hello my friends in Barla.

1446
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:47,810
Hello my faithful brothers
who open their hearts for me! Hello.

1447
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,846
Allah makes everything good,
makes everything beautiful.

1448
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:55,725
-Welcome hodja.
-Thank you.

1449
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:58,885
-Welcome hodja.
-Thank you.

1450
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,611
Welcome master.

1451
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:20,406
Brother Mehmet, if Allah willing, the services of
Koran will develop more and more.

1452
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:25,451
All the world will be enlightened
with the divine light.

1453
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:28,970
With Allah willing master.
With the blessing of your pray, hopefully.

1454
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:33,164
Welcome my hodja.

1455
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,211
Welcome hodja.

1456
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:48,330
Forgive our mistakes.

1457
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:58,763
We don't support animosity,
but friendship.

1458
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:03,401
Hodja.

1459
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:05,922
Hodja.

1460
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:11,286
Will you accept me as a student?

1461
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:14,890
Please forgive me hodja.

1462
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:30,930
My brothers!

1463
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:37,684
We hurried up and came in linter.

1464
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:44,720
You will come in a heavenly spring!

1465
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:53,684
Our duty is to act positively,
not to act negatively.

1466
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:59,649
I carefully analyzed the ones
who tyrannized me.

1467
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:04,450
There aren't any Turks among them.

1468
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:11,569
Because, there is not a tyrannizing vein
in the real Turkish people.

1469
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:20,086
I Ion't have a temper or complain about
the people who tormented me.

1470
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:25,290
I forgive them.

1471
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:29,208
May Allah also forgive them.

1472
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:39,450
Allah is the most merciful of the mercy showers.

1473
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:43,246
Allah speaks the truth!

1474
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:52,768
We are all like the leaves of this maple tree.
We have to clamp together.

1475
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:18,890
Oh my friends who gave their hearts to Koran,
the seeds of Divine Light that has been sow...

1476
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:21,640
...will blossom on earth.

1477
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:28,322
As a payment of our services
we are not expecting from you...

1478
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:36,242
...to visit us at our graves
when you come to pass away.

1479
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:45,165
Put some of those spring flowers
on the gravestone. And pray for us.

1480
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:52,889
We will advise to the doorkeeper.
You will be welcomed.

1481
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:05,088
I can live without bread.
I can not live without freedom.

1482
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:33,769
What gives me pain is only
the menaces which Islam is exposed to.

1483
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:39,521
In the past, the menaces were coming from
outside, so it las easy to tight against them.

1484
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:45,526
Now, the menace comes lithin.
The lorm entered into the body.

1485
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:48,528
Now, the fight became harder.

1486
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:52,929
I am afraid that the body of our society
can not succumb.

1487
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:55,489
Because, they lon't sense the enemy.

1488
02:33:56,800 --> 02:34:02,364
They'II think that the biggest enemy who tears
their vital vein off, who drinks their blood is a friend

1489
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:08,929
If the society's eye is blinded, then
the fortress of the faith will be in danger.

1490
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:14,171
This is my agony, this is my one and only agony.

1491
02:34:15,480 --> 02:34:21,442
I don't have time to think about the pains
and troubles that I experienced personally.

1492
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:27,247
Iwish that I encounter pains
thousand times more than this...

1493
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:31,606
...but the future of the
fortress of faith be secured.

1494
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:34,801
I see all the big heads in negligence.

1495
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:40,168
The corrupted columns of the blasphemy
can not hold the fortress of faith.

1496
02:34:40,680 --> 02:34:45,641
Therefore, I concentrated
all my efforts on faith.

1497
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:51,360
They ask me:
Why you attacked this and that?

1498
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:54,887
I am unaware.

1499
02:34:55,560 --> 02:35:00,964
Right in front of me, there is an
enormous tire, its flames rising up to the sky.

1500
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:06,967
In this tire, my descent is burning,
my faith is set on tire, its burning.

1501
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:12,243
I am running to put the Ere out,
I am running to save my faith.

1502
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:19,529
On my lay, somebody wants to stop me
and my foot hits him, what does it matter?

1503
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:26,404
Against such a horrible tire,
will this small event mean anything?

1504
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:29,962
Narrow minds! Small minds!

1505
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:36,246
Do they think that I am a man
who wants to save his own soul?

1506
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:53,169
Throughout my eighty years of life,
l've known nothing about the worldly pleasures.

1507
02:35:53,880 --> 02:36:03,847
I spent a whole life in battle fields,
in slavery dungeons, or in homeland's prisons...

1508
02:36:03,960 --> 02:36:08,966
...homeland's courtrooms. There is no torment
or cruelty left that I didn't experience.

1509
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:13,402
I have been treated like a criminal
in the court martial.

1510
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:17,721
I have been sent to exile from
a place to another like a Vagabond.

1511
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:25,051
I got disciplinary segregations
in homeland prisons for months.

1512
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:28,288
I have been poisoned many times.

1513
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:31,805
I have suffered various affronts.

1514
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:37,320
There were times I wished to die
rather than living.

1515
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:41,926
If my religion didn't
forbid me to commit suicide...

1516
02:36:42,440 --> 02:36:47,571
...maybe this Said would be under
the ground and already molded away.

1517
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:54,044
Then, I have sacrificed my afterlife
for the salvation of society's faith.

1518
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:59,800
I have no desire for the paradise
nor the fear of hell.

1519
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:05,361
Not only one Said, but thousands of Saids
may be sacrificed for the society...

1520
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:10,681
...not only for the tlenty live millions of
people in Turkish society...

1521
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:15,330
...but for the whole Islam society
with hundreds of millions.

1522
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:22,646
If our Koran stays on earth without community,
I don't want to be in heaven because...

1523
02:37:22,960 --> 02:37:28,251
...it will be a dungeon for me.
I'm willing to burn in the flames of hell...

1524
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:32,248
...If I'm going to see that the people's
faith is secured.

1525
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:39,081
Because my soul will be in a bed of roses,
when my body burns in flames.
