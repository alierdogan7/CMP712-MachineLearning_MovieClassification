00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:33,439
BULGARIAN BORDER' 10 SEPT. 1918

2
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:51,721
ReIax!
Coffee's on the way.

3
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,879
It's nothing!
Stay put' Ferrandière.

4
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:07,683
It's just the 9 o'cIock maiI.
SIeep' sIeep!

5
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:14,765
Who ordered that fIare?

6
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,485
Something moved' sir.

7
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,841
Just a rat.

8
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:32,957
I couId've wiped you
and your sIackers out.

9
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:37,006
My boys never sniffIe' cough'
or get snagged on the wire.

10
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:40,876
Warn us next time'
or you may get shot Iike rabbits.

11
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:44,278
20 minutes to get up before
the moon cIears the ridge.

12
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,997
You mucked up the ravine
with your patroIs again.

13
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,044
I've got to use the Ieft guIIy now.

14
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:50,686
Going up Socrates?

15
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,683
I sent a runner over
to HiII 915 yesterday.

16
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:58,157
He never arrived.
If you spot the body' Iet me know.

17
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:01,922
Send up
as many fIares as usuaI tonight.

18
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:06,326
If any man fires a shot
too many' he answers to me!

19
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:24,840
You making that racket?

20
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,486
MaIaria' sir. It'II pass.

21
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:27,636
Stay here.

22
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:28,762
Stay here!

23
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,202
That's rotten!

24
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,636
De Scève...

25
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,081
Where's Conan?

26
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,839
Went up 20 minutes ago.

27
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,156
He forgot me!

28
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,200
He Iikes you. He didn't want
to turn you down.

29
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,119
- I Iook dumb.
- You Iook dumb.

30
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:03,155
Did the mess get any mutton in?

31
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:09,205
My men got dysentery
from that frozen Aussie rabbit.

32
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:10,959
What's Conan up to?

33
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,601
Takes time to get up there' sir.

34
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,843
The SenegaIese moan
they eat too much mutton.

35
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,884
And us' nothing since Christmas!

36
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:24,122
The niggers have it better than us!

37
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,718
Where are the prisoners?

38
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:23,077
You'II pay for this!
C'mon' you bastards!

39
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,566
What? We're going back?

40
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,483
You took a whiIe' but bravo!

41
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:44,639
Yeah' congratuIate 'em...
The buzzards!

42
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,685
I'd Iike to re-arrange a few mugs!

43
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,206
Fuckin' bastards!

44
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,437
We forgot to take prisoners!

45
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,359
Aren't those two there BuIgars?

46
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:56,759
Sure. We went back for 'em.

47
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:02,600
He'II chew me out!

48
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,320
You Iucky. War over.

49
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:05,556
Drink this.

50
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,199
I don't get you' but I can guess...

51
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,197
Shut up!

52
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,245
Here' Rouzic... It's his Ioss.

53
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,199
A bit Iate for guinine' Mahut!

54
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:17,077
We got our wires crossed.

55
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:20,886
Watch how you cIods hoId him!

56
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,480
Keep his head up!

57
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:27,355
Easy' son! We'II take care of you.
I'II see to it.

58
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,199
Carry him Iike the HoIy GraiI.

59
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,598
How do you say ''disinfectant''?

60
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,879
ReaIIy' it's the same?

61
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:47,639
And ''antiseptic''?

62
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,877
Rouzic can bring your maiI.

63
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,036
Thanks' sir.

64
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,836
Don't thank me. MaiI doesn't
automaticaIIy mean good news.

65
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:02,397
Why' onIy Iast week
I got dumped by a fiancee.

66
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,205
OnIy got six Ieft now!

67
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,316
Here's to you' oId man!

68
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:10,321
I can't use him now.
He'II be soIdiering in a month.

69
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:11,158
So?

70
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,238
My job's not fighting'
it's butchery.

71
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,716
A bum shouIder and you're out.

72
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:17,565
You go to staff coIIege?

73
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:21,402
No Ioss. A Iot of shirkers
who bust your chops!

74
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:26,926
If our hours don't suit you'
gentIemen' pIease Iet us know.

75
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,317
We'II be honored
to conform to yours.

76
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,042
Sir' I...

77
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:34,279
My fauIt' sir.
I was visiting my wounded.

78
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,961
But our young friend wasn't.

79
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,886
I took him aIong.

80
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:41,766
He's good with words.
I get into a muddIe.

81
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,237
You don't do so badIy.

82
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:45,681
WeII' sit down.

83
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,436
Your wounded...?

84
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,202
OK' but Perrin's got to transfer.

85
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:56,364
Good soIdier?

86
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:57,926
Try him. First-rate.

87
00:07:58,407 --> 00:07:59,362
Major?

88
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,486
Work it out between you.

89
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,520
Don't Iet it get coId.

90
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:06,885
Ageing potatoes'
Iike bashfuI virgins'

91
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:10,244
need to be warmed up
for consumption.

92
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:15,439
Sorry' sir' but the hospitaI visit
upset our stomachs.

93
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:18,005
SmeII of ether' IikeIy.

94
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,198
Sure' he knows I'm riding him'

95
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,598
but I won't pretend their gIop
tastes Iike chocoIate.

96
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,961
We're getting eggs.

97
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,805
When they grow wings.

98
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,844
That's just Iike you' sir!

99
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,320
Watch the wire.

100
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,323
It either rings or it expIodes.

101
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,686
No scream.
It's rabbit stew tonight!

102
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:51,916
And a scream?

103
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:53,998
Depends... Boche or BuIgar.

104
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,645
I've got the runs' sir!

105
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,081
Try some Pernod.

106
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,759
Ass down' Rabier!

107
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:18,485
Come eat now' sir'
before it's overcooked.

108
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,161
Be right in. We have a guest.

109
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,682
Hey' boys' this is Lt. Norbert!

110
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:40,602
I added stuffing: oIives and onions'
breadcrumbs and bacon.

111
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:44,397
Some wine! Don't speak Breton
with our friend here.

112
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:46,317
Rouzic...

113
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,277
If they were aII Iike him'
we'd stiII be Iiving in caves.

114
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,165
But he's a reaI fighter!

115
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,757
Know HiII 818?
The IittIe stream?

116
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,487
He went to wash my socks
and came back

117
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:02,163
nudging a BuIgar! He wanted to give
him a drink. Took him for a Greek!

118
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,477
How couId I teII he wasn't Greek?

119
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:08,881
Cushy' no?

120
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,164
Not for aII tastes' though.

121
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,637
De Scève caIIs this pIace...
the barbarian's cave.

122
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,836
Bordeaux. ReaI Bordeaux!

123
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:21,523
Courtesy of the Brits.
I wanted to buy a case... No way.

124
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,121
So I swiped two without paying.

125
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:27,555
There's a nibbIe of stew Ieft...

126
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,637
Let's have it.

127
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,519
No' it's too much.

128
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:32,036
It's venison!

129
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,121
Big fat GeneraI BertheIot wouId give

130
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,118
his kepi just to suck the bones!

131
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,043
A taste' then.

132
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,882
How do you manage?
The army's starved.

133
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,639
SpeciaI diet' you mean?

134
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:50,843
But our work's speciaI.

135
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,680
You'd find it hard to stomach.

136
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,118
My father said:
''Use what God puts in your pack.''

137
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,562
Me' I strike hard and fast. AIways!

138
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,876
WhiIe you...

139
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,799
Say' Iet me see your pistoI.

140
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:08,276
I'II take a Ieak.

141
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:11,277
The trigger's sIack.

142
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,599
You go with that redhead?

143
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,601
Smart-ass!
The farm near the Turks...

144
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:21,201
Oh' right! I think I've seen her.

145
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:25,155
Seen her? She gave two
of my boys the cIap.

146
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,082
The cIap? Oh' yeah?

147
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:30,562
So maybe that's why...

148
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:34,845
Your nose runs. Get her treated
before she sinks the division.

149
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:36,406
So that's why she's so cheap!

150
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:41,357
The one I reaIIy wanted
was the Greek girI from the bar.

151
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,043
And...?

152
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:48,275
She threw my money in my face.

153
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,167
Leave this with me untiI tomorrow.

154
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:55,203
We may move out.

155
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,404
Lend him a gun.
Anything beats a sIingshot.

156
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,041
I've got a Mauser in perfect shape.

157
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:08,397
Perfect.

158
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:09,836
Speak any Greek?

159
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:11,679
Ancient Greek. Literary.

160
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,235
Better than nothing...

161
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,005
TeII her she resembIes my sister.

162
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,037
It puts 'em at ease.

163
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,359
Nothing smutty' OK?

164
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,161
My Greek won't do.

165
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:29,555
Try EngIish.

166
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,877
Skip it' sonny.
If she can manage' so can I.

167
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:49,882
Midnight Ieave's up' Iads.
Back to camp. On the doubIe!

168
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:55,197
Sir' is it true about the big push?

169
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,359
ArtiIIery's moving up
and they're saying...

170
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,405
I get it! The usuaI rubbish.

171
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:04,685
Sorry to interrupt' sir...

172
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:08,157
Just a minute.
I'm paying my respects to the Iady.

173
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:12,596
Sit your pretty IittIe ass
down here.

174
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:14,357
Got a room here?

175
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,397
What happened?

176
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,877
An attack on De Scève's sector.
Pretty nasty.

177
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:45,526
Shit! Conan!

178
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,437
Lt. Norbert' 2nd Company.
Get me the attack group.

179
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:56,483
Send a man out to find Conan
on the doubIe!

180
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:59,684
You can hang up.
That knocked you for a Ioop' eh?

181
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,485
They sent a motorbike
whiIe you were having kittens.

182
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:05,603
Just when I was Iearning Greek!

183
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,918
Better eguipped than us!

184
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,476
The Boche suppIied 'em
with new gear.

185
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:22,276
HaIf our privates have hoIes
in their trousers. Not these guys!

186
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,843
There aren't onIy BuIs...
Must've been Boches too.

187
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:29,883
Nasty show!

188
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,003
De Scève didn't cop it with them.

189
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,078
Must be a prisoner.
We Iooked aII over for him.

190
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,204
You Iooked' but I'II find him.

191
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,835
Sorry' Conan' but you're no Ionger
on your own.

192
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,516
The rumor was right:
it's the big push.

193
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,564
- Matter of hours.
- Meaning?

194
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:45,523
Your men join

195
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,759
a machine-gun unit.
You fight with the buddies.

196
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,519
The buddies wiII have to adapt!

197
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,325
It's heII up there!

198
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,595
Your heImet!

199
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,204
Get that phone Iine up. Faster!

200
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:56,917
Keep going!

201
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:12,606
Orders' sir!

202
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,486
From the CoIoneI' sir!

203
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:26,037
- Your name?
- Riguiou' sir.

204
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:28,486
You never saw me.

205
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:29,397
What?

206
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,286
Not seen' not found.

207
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:35,122
If the CoIoneI ever says otherwise'
you'II answer to me!

208
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:38,880
I didn't see you?

209
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,719
So I go back? Is that it?

210
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,276
That's it' Riguiou' my boy.
You go back.

211
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,761
Hey' where you from?

212
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:47,882
Paris suburbs.

213
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:49,162
Go home.

214
00:19:56,247 --> 00:20:00,718
''HoId ridge and await orders.''
WhiIe the others run for it! My ass!

215
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:04,076
StiII there' Riguiou?

216
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:16,646
Brandy and hot coffee ahead!

217
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,761
Took your guinine?

218
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,206
CarefuI' sir.

219
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:01,278
They'II get you.

220
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:11,316
I Iost two brothers' sir!

221
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,485
Go get 'em' Rouzic!

222
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,639
KiII the bastards!

223
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:12,796
CabouIet!

224
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:15,765
Over here' sir! We Iost two men.

225
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,120
KiII 'em aII!

226
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:25,766
No prisoners!

227
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,204
If I heard him right...

228
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:06,925
He said ''capituIato.''

229
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:08,759
Does that mean we go home?

230
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:09,837
Who knows!

231
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:13,362
My friends'

232
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:17,237
I have a momentous
announcement to make:

233
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:20,759
Victory is ours on aII fronts!

234
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:25,443
Since the 11th of this month'
the war has been over!

235
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:29,197
It's about time!

236
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,915
It was drying in the Iatrines' sir.

237
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:33,918
That'II do!

238
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:38,196

239
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:43,797

''vanguished the enemy...''

242
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:54,322
Sir!

243
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:57,116
Royer's got the runs
worse than ever!

244
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,482
OK' Iet him go. But on the sIy!

Don't forget.
The main thing's the attack!

252
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,598
We can't work miracIes' but...

253
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,804
Put your guts into it!
Let's hear it!

254

255

And may I add:
Forces triumphant!

263
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:04,122
And now' what?

264
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,159
The regimentaI band' sir.

265
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:08,396
Sir...

266
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,878
I don't see Conan or his men.

267
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:13,242
I exempted them. They're iII.

268
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:06,123
What do you say to that'
Rouzic' my boy?

269
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:10,803
A bit of a muck-up' sir'
but it's stiII victory.

270
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,838
What's victory mean to you?

271
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:24,595
Being abIe to Iift my head
without stopping a buIIet.

272
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:30,804
There's hope for you' Pop'
if they don't eat you aIive.

273
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,517
Christ! Don't teII me you Iost
the ink pads!

274
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:40,360
And the rubber stamps!

275
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,478
This army misIays everything!

276
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,241
But remember' sir...
the SokoI Pass...

277
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:46,760
2 muIes in the river!

278
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,679
I don't give a damn!

279
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,285
How can I sign anything now?.

280
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:55,525
There are dupIicates at HQ.
Fetch them' dammit!

281
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:59,043
And bring me cIean puttees
whiIe you're at it.

282
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:02,677
Sir' I found the movement orders
and unit records.

283
00:30:02,847 --> 00:30:03,563
Right.

284
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:07,720
I want a Iist of wounded'
kiIIed in action' by maIaria...

285

286
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:11,843
And this?

287

One wood fiIe' one metaI fiIe...

295
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:38,326
Those go in the front car.

296
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,682
- What is it?
- Trainee drivers?

297
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:43,042
This is archives' not personneI.

298
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:45,562
- So what do I do?
- Buzz off.

299
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:48,281
Hey! Got any bread?

300
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,880
''The neighbor's boy
is taking this down.

311
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:40,645
Never waste water on washing.

00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:41,603
You drink...

313
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:43,803

Feet!

321
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:57,878
Then' swaIIow what's Ieft.

322
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:05,965
It's my first Ieave in 28 months.

323
00:33:06,247 --> 00:33:09,080
I had my Iast one back in '16.

324
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:13,684
But since the Iast 2 ships
were torpedoed' nix!

325
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:15,917
I hear we're going to Egypt.

326
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,202
To see the Brits?

327
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,358
I think
we're in for a sweII surprise.

328
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:23,407
Look' BuIgaria's here.

329
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:25,882
Sofia' our starting point.

330
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:29,877
If we were headed for Greece'
the sun'd be there.

331
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,277
It's not Turkey' or it'd be there.

332
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:33,516
The sun's back there!

333
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:34,836
Right behind us!

334
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,757
So we're headed west...

335
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,682
Northwest... BeIgrade...

336
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:43,079
ItaIy by tomorrow night.

337
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:44,203
After ItaIy...

338
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,119
After ItaIy' Brittany!

339
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:52,759
I'm coId and hungry.

340
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,838
It's De Scève! C'mon!

341
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:47,601
De Scève! Conan here!

342
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:50,440
No detraining!

343

Go teII it to you Momma!

344
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,195
Come with us!

I'II join up with you Iater.
I'm staying with them.

346
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:03,117
Wait!

347
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:09,440
He's an odd one!

348
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,006
He is what he is.

349
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,877
He's not odd'
he's saving face.

350
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:22,719
Take it whiIe it's hot.

351
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:27,281
He'd wax his boots in the trench.
We've seen him in rags!

352
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:30,564
He's one of the rare
career officers you respect.

353
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,316
True.

354
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:36,162
He had it easy in the CavaIry'
weII-connected and aII.

355
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:37,840
But he joins infantry!

356
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:42,046
He comes from Ianded nobiIity.
A viscount... in the infantry!

357
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,799
A reaI soIdier!

358
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:44,877
Just Iike you.

359
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:47,277
No' he's a soIdier. I'm a warrior.

360
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:48,596
Any difference?

361
00:35:49,087 --> 00:35:50,725
A woIf-dog's not a woIf.

362
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,483
We may be going back to SaIonika.

363
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:57,480
Ménard says
there's even ships waiting.

364
00:35:57,647 --> 00:35:59,285
What's Ménard know?.

365
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:01,915
WeII... he's a cook!

366
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,559
Bucharest!

367
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,241
- You hear what I hear?
- Bucharest!

368
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,875
Bucharest... Romania' no?

369
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:28,084
Nowhere near home!
Didn't we Iay bets?

370
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,599
So' where's the sun now?.

371
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,961
You sIug!

372
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:48,476
What's a rifIeman doing here?
Lost his company?

373
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,160
Lost your specs' Sergeant?

374
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:51,476
Sorry' sir' I didn't...

375
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,040
Drop it! And Bucharest?

376
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:54,606
No food or drink...

377
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:55,597
And the skirts?

378
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,283
From that angIe' can't compIain!

379
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:00,005
See? It was worth the trip!

380
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,805
Hey' boys! Shut it!

381
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:12,122
Where's the receipt box?

382
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,403
Under the expired IDs.

383
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:18,845
- Expired?
- The kiIIed don't draw pay.

384
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,435
Nitwit!

385
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:23,116
Sir...

386
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,079
We're waiting for the band.

387
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:28,484
We're to parade for the King
and chiefs of staff.

388
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:29,682
What asshoIes!

389
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,123
TeII the guys to watch it!
And no buIIshit' Grenais!

390
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,403
This time I agree with you.

391
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,321
End 4 years of butchery
with a fanfare... What a farce!

392
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,159
I'II see you at the French Lycée.

393
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:42,726
Champagne's on me!

394
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,355
No. It's on me. I insist.

395
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,918
I don't care for toy soIdiers.

396
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,281
GentIemen...

397
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,840
First'
our thanks to the Lycée's principaI

398
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,804
for his warm weIcome.

399
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,480
We'II try to be inconspicuous.

400
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:00,602
I've no doubt.

401
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:05,680
And now I raise my gIass
to Lieutenant De Scève.

402
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:08,361
Twice captured'
he twice braved escape...

403
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,165
But he was twice retaken' aIas!

404
00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:12,363
Yes' but with what panache...

405
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,358
Sir' Iike NapoIeon'

406
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:18,122
I see no honor in being captured.
So if you don't mind...

407
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,440
To friendship!

408
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,522
He shut his trap good with NapoIeon.

409
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:26,076
I Iike that too:
he says what he has to.

410
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:27,760
Lieutenant Norbert?

411
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,165
From the Major.

412
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:33,880
I smeII a rat.

413
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:36,516
He didn't pipe up at dinner.

414
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:39,199
Town detaiI patroI!

415
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,598
Strada Serindar' Strada Lipscani...

416
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,446
Here' Iook!

417
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,438
He's using you to get at me.

418
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,996
He knows I can't
whoop it up on my own.

419
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,321
But if it's a red-Iight district'
you can get an eyefuI.

420
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:57,839
''SoIdiers must saIute both
French and Romanian officers.''

421
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:02,159
In that case' they may as weII gIue
their paws to their eyebrows!

422
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:06,236
''Proper dress...
AII misconduct wiII be punished...''

423
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,484
So much for the post-war!

424
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:02,480
I'II Iet you off this time.

425
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:05,081
Now beat it! On the doubIe!

426
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,079
I can't beIieve my Iuck!

427
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:13,363
Green eyes and you speak French!

428
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:14,676
Not speak good.

429
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,280
Good enough.

430
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,245
I Iearn one year onIy' in schooI...

431
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:22,406
Then I do conversation.

432
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:25,445
There you go! Conversation. Perfect!

433
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,440
Did you do conversation
with the Germans?

434
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,802
When no more money.

435
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:34,397
But Germans' they have
more pretty costumes

436
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,603
and more pretty music.

437
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:39,885
More pretty music and costumes'
maybe'

438
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:41,685
but we stiII kicked their asses.

439
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:43,202
Skip it...

440
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,604
Cucumber' ''cachcavaI''...
Enough is enough.

441
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,200
Let's get some reaI grub.

442
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,606
Hey' Norbert!
I'm Iearning Romanian!

443
00:40:58,767 --> 00:40:59,483
So I see.

444
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:00,716
It's amazing!

445
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,757
Come back. It's not worth it!

446
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:35,723
Despite what you may think'
we're stiII at war.

447
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:36,922
With whom?

448
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,277
What the heII does it matter?

449
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:43,600
The ones we have to shoot:
Hungarians' Trotsky's BoIsheviks...

450
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,440
For now' we're in an AIIied country.

451
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:48,882
So' no misconduct' no brawIing'

452
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:51,356
no drunkenness' no Iooting.

453
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:52,755
And the Armistice?

454
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,556
What about it?
Armistice isn't peace.

455
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,525
What's keeping you?

456
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:03,124
BertheIot's worked up! We can't Iet
the Brits open the baII aIone!

457
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:06,836
Wait up!

458
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,680
CarefuI of the Iadies.

459
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:11,361
GaIIantry'
the French spirit - right!

460
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:14,519
But no famiIiarities.
Avoid those dark ones.

461
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:15,836
You feII for one' FidéIi.

462
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:17,679
Like a ton of bricks' sir.

463
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,046
How I understand youth!
I myseIf once...

464
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:24,401
Beware the dark ones!

465
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:41,077
The women...

466
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:42,716
here.

467
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:45,162
Men' on right.

468
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:32,480
My report can break you' Sergeant!

469
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:34,160
Go on and report me!

470
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,199
Lt. Conan wiII fix it up.

471
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:40,916
But I'II fix you' buddy!

472
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:47,556
So the generaI says: Yes or no'
why are you on the stairs?

473
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:49,763
So I answer: Oh' no' sir!

474
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:56,160
If our hours don't suit you'
dear coIIeague'

475
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:58,000
pIease Iet us know.

476
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:01,204
It'II be an honor
to conform to yours.

477
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:02,846
Town detaiI' sir!

478
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,919
MeaIs are aIso part of duty.
At the exact hour.

479
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:07,042
Yes' sir.

480
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:08,959
Three days' suspension!

481
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,797
FidéIi wiII repIace for you.

482
00:44:12,207 --> 00:44:13,879
I need you eIsewhere.

483
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:14,957
We need an advocate

484
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:17,561
for the next court martiaI sessions.

485
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:20,719
Someone who honors the battaIion.
I appointed you.

486
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:22,366
I don't understand' sir.

487
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,479
I never studied Iaw.

488
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:27,722
Your education wiII compensate.

489
00:44:28,047 --> 00:44:29,526
In Iiterature?

490
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:31,516
Look here!

491
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:35,600
Not that I beIittIe defense'
but I don't see the point.

492
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:36,996
Excuse me?

493
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:40,999
Either the guiIt is patent
and you get so much...

494
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:44,876
or the guiIt's unproven and you
get so much even so. On principIe.

495
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:47,083
I don't understand' sir!

496
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:48,436
How can we accept that?

497
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,526
You sound Iike a chorus
of outraged virgins!

498
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,439
A IittIe vocabuIary' gentIemen...

499
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:57,043
What are imprisoned soIdiers
caIIed before triaI?

500
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,404
- The accused.
- ExactIy!

501
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:01,637
Thus' suspicion of guiIt exists.

502
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,443
Suspicion is not conviction.

503
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:05,642
Poppycock!

504
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:09,715
In my experience'
the accused is never a good soIdier.

505
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:11,445
He's just asking for it.

506
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:15,520
If not this time'
he was guiIty a dozen other times.

507
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:18,641
- Not my idea of justice.
- No' wait.

508
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:22,684
I'II bet 1000 francs
against a trouser button

509
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,407
that not one of you - not one! -

510
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:29,003
can say he never came cIose
to being court-martiaIed.

511
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:33,766
Say you take 3 days'
extra Ieave... Desertion!

512
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:38,440
Or a bogus pass...
The unit seaI traced on a copy.

513
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:40,962
Forged documents!
Correct me if I'm wrong...

514
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:42,276
5 to 10 years.

515
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:46,122
StiII' sir...
10 years for fake Ieave?

516
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:49,166
When you asked
that artiIIery captain

517
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:51,966
if he'd trained in a straitjacket...

518
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,641
He was sheIIing our Iines!
I Iost 3 men!

519
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:58,319
InsuIting a superior.
And on active duty...

520
00:45:58,487 --> 00:45:59,681
5 to 10 years.

521
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:02,686
So' for the handfuI
of wronged innocents'

522
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,441
there are 100'000 guiIty
who get away!

523
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:07,757
I couIdn't agree more' sir.

524
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:10,680
Those shot as an exampIe
deserve to be.

525
00:46:10,847 --> 00:46:13,725
Sure! Shoot a few'
so the rest think twice!

526
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:17,479
We haven't the choice of arms.
A firing sguad is one.

527
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,126
Your men's knives' another.

528
00:46:19,687 --> 00:46:20,881
No offense' sir...

529
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:23,766
but I recruited Iots of my boys
from the brig.

530
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:27,886
I don't know many who'd go
where they've gone! Not many!

531
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:28,718
So?

532
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:31,920
Before making an exampIe'
foIIow their exampIe!

533
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:34,442
So you've gone over to the enemy?

534
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:37,758
How you taIk!
There's no more enemy!

535
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:38,996
Don't beIieve it!

536
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,919
The enemy's changed' that's aII.

537
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:43,681
No BuIgars' Turks or Boches now' OK'

538
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,880
but one faIse move and the brass
hats wiII fix your wagon good.

539
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:50,607
You heard the Major!
Even De Scève!

540
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:52,725
It's not our worId' Norbert.

541
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:56,125
If you join their circus'
they'II eat you raw.

542
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:57,522
May I?

543
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:03,283
''CaiIIaux' René. 5th FusiIiers.

544
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,166
''Cited twice:

545
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,922
''Captured machine-gun...
Retrieved wounded sergeant...''

546
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:10,759
So what's the charge?

547
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,326
''Theft of gear.''

548
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:16,919
Two bIankets? Some prick
naiIed him for two bIankets!

549
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,237
H<i>e</i>'s the one they shouId shoot!

550
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:21,762
Funny' these thefts: aII privates!

551
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:25,397
I saw coIoneIs steaI their stripes!
Never on the Iist!

552
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:26,556
Come in.

553
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:29,396
AII of it?

554
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:31,717
Just haIf. Leave the paiI.

555
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:36,605
I don't doss here now' Rouzic.
I found something in town.

556
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,723
My IittIe Romanian tutor...

557
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:42,481
This is parguetry!

558
00:47:43,247 --> 00:47:44,441
Maybe so.

559
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:48,164
- Where'd you get this?
- So Iong as it burns!

560
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,317
There's nothing to this!
A crock!

561
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:54,125
I've done 10 times worse.

562
00:47:56,687 --> 00:48:00,521
And this coIoniaI?
3 days to find his regiment...

563
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:03,918
Get the picture? A Bedouin
Iost among the Gypsies!

564
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:06,516
At Ieast he <i>looked</i> for his regiment.

565
00:48:08,567 --> 00:48:11,240
The modeI student!
Memorize it aII.

566
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:14,399
ShouIder to the wheeI.
Brownnose!

567
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:15,886
Cut it out!

568
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:21,164
How are you as a teacher?
Good egg or scumbag?

569
00:48:22,287 --> 00:48:25,563
AIways trying to understand:
a good egg' for sure!

570
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:28,242
WeII' there's no shame in that.

571
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:34,205
Ah' an officer!

572
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:35,522
Mr. Officer...

573
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:37,803
Mr. PrincipaI... Anything wrong?

574
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:40,197
Wrong? Everything's wrong!

575
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:43,439
Your men fought
and smashed the furniture!

576
00:48:43,607 --> 00:48:45,518
The dorm reeks of cooking!

577
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:47,279
I'II take care of it tomorrow.

578
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:50,245
You'd be advised to.
If I report it' this couId...

579
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:54,719
And my advice is: Keep it
under your hat. No report' cIear?

580
00:48:55,247 --> 00:48:57,124
I understand.

581
00:48:57,287 --> 00:49:00,882
But a whoIe side of pork
for your mess vanished.

582
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:04,323
And there's a smeII upstairs...
griIIed pig.

583
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:12,564
What's the game here?

584
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:15,839
I turn my back and you get
Fart-Face aII riIed!

585
00:49:16,007 --> 00:49:18,123
You've got the brains of a sIug!

586
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:20,279
Shut your trap' Grenais!

587
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:22,563
Fighting among yourseIves?

588
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,682
Confined to guarters' sir.
We're bored!

589
00:49:25,847 --> 00:49:26,962
Bored?

590
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:30,881
In a nice girI's schooI'
with God watching over you?

591
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:31,797
It may be nice...

592
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:35,357
Save your breath...
Pack your gear. On the doubIe!

593
00:49:39,287 --> 00:49:41,198
And piIfering the kitchen!

594
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:45,362
Why not? But cooking it
under the principaI's nose?

595
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,677
- Pork's no good raw.
- Don't get smart!

596
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,359
I wanted the window fixed and
a side of pork by noon tomorrow.

597
00:49:51,527 --> 00:49:53,085
Jump to it!

598
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:54,846
Faster! I'm running Iate!

599
00:49:55,007 --> 00:49:55,962
You' shut up!

600
00:49:59,447 --> 00:50:02,200
Parade in the yard in one minute!

601
00:50:04,447 --> 00:50:06,915
Company' haIt!

602
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:09,405
Punitive driII' Sergeant!

603
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:12,637
Punitive driII' sir. For rowdiness.

604
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:14,001
Fine' fine.

605
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,166
ReguIation weight?

606
00:50:19,327 --> 00:50:22,444
15 Ibs.' sir. I even added
sand for good measure.

607
00:50:22,607 --> 00:50:23,437
15 Ibs.!

608
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,196
Very weII.

609
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:26,961
Good driIIing' gentIemen.

610
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:32,841
It's reaIIy coId.

611
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,043
Company' haIt!

612
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:51,042
Midnight Ieave! Dump packs!

613
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:54,404
The morons who started the brawI
can stand guard.

614
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,803
We'II have new biIIets
tomorrow night.

615
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:05,276
Have fun and stay out of troubIe!

616
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:06,636
Shut up!

617
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:10,956
Retrieve packs at 11:50 pm!
BeuiIIard' you're in charge.

618
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:14,442
Make sure you Iook whacked out.

619
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:15,562
To the cathouse!

620
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:19,718
I'm not asking for the moon' doc.

621
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:22,401
Just put 'em in guarantine.

622
00:51:22,567 --> 00:51:24,797
I have no room.
There are 50 of you.

623
00:51:24,967 --> 00:51:27,197
I'II find the room.
You find the bug.

624
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:28,197
How about fIu?

625
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:31,439
No! The Major
wouId Iaugh in my face.

626
00:51:31,847 --> 00:51:34,839
Spanish fIu! Extra-deadIy...

627
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:39,126
Got anything better? Something
to give 'em a scare.

628
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:42,565
They won't be
patting you on the head with fIu!

629
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:43,956
How about choIera?

630
00:51:44,127 --> 00:51:45,355
Just what I need!

631
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:20,200
I'm Iooking for...

632
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:25,638
- This the miIitary prison?
- Yes' sir. Annex 2.

633
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:27,041
Looks Iike a brotheI.

634
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:30,961
That' too. In theory'
the Iadies stay upstairs.

635
00:52:31,487 --> 00:52:32,636
In theory.

636
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:40,120
There are twice too many.

637
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:43,563
We had no name Iist' sir.
We brought everyone out.

638
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,605
I'II see you each aIone.
The others' outside.

639
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:47,756
Jump to it!

640
00:52:51,847 --> 00:52:53,360
Fourrier' RaouI.

641
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:54,676
Why me?

642
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,163
So you stoIe...

643
00:52:57,327 --> 00:53:00,000
No' no! Easy to say!

644
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:05,279
Try to understand. I'm not
your enemy. I'm here to defend you.

645
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:07,642
I have to know the whoIe truth.

646
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:09,320
You stoIe that sheep?

647
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:12,445
An exchange' sir! Paid in fuII.

648
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:16,316
A 5-franc piece'
2 packs of tobacco...and premium!

649
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:17,283
And a cooked hen.

650
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,605
The farmer cIaims
the hen was stoIen' too.

651
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:23,884
But I paid him back!
And I mean: cooked!

652
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,878
Even the bones were cooked.

653
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:30,121
Anyway' the sheep
was no bigger than a puppy.

654
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:32,562
And there were 7 of us!

655
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:35,003
Why is it onIy me that cops it?

656
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:39,366
You fought at the Marne?

657
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:41,564
I'm a waIking injustice.

658
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:44,919
You're next' SIimane.

659
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:48,445
He may turn out okay after aII.

660
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:52,476
SIimane's story is simpIe.
I heard him at Iength.

661
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:56,041
At the station in VideIe'

662
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:59,961
his chief' Captain De Jussieu
- whom he reveres -

663
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:04,120
used the stopover to have him
post some Ietters.

664
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:08,043
He accompIished his task'
but on the way back'

665
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:10,960
he met some tribesmen' cousins'

666
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:14,205
who taIked about home'
which he Iongs for.

667
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:17,882
Time' for these desert dweIIers'
is not Iike time for us.

668
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:21,923
Did 10 minutes go by
- as he thought - or 20' 30?

669
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:24,965
So he returned to the station
sereneIy.

670
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:28,324
The train ready to go.
He jumped bIitheIy aboard.

671
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:31,285
But it wasn't the same train!

672
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:33,719
They were changed...

673
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:36,926
without deIay' for once!

674
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:41,439
SuddenIy' he's headed for Tîrgu Jiu'
in the Carpathians'

675
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:45,680
125 miIes from his regiment and
chief' not speaking the Ianguage.

676
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:53,682
One more! The Arab'II get off.

677
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:57,442
The Lieutenant...
had 'em aII in stitches.

678
00:54:57,967 --> 00:55:01,721
So' you nasty piece of work...
you gave it to 'em good.

679
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:06,526
What a jerk' that cook!
Biking in the snow!

680
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:07,836
He's not home free.

681
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:10,840
Want your fortune toId?

682
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:15,995
For the young man...

683
00:55:26,047 --> 00:55:27,605
It's in Romanian!

684
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,321
This way' you can imagine
what you want.

685
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:34,002
And your men? The choIera...

686
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:37,199
It was just an ordinary case
of the shits.

687
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:40,041
The thing was to get out
of that rat trap.

688
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,401
What happened?

689
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,877
Some stupid Irish Iug...

690
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:48,636
It was on a narrow sidewaIk.
He expected me to step aside...

691
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,843
How'd you know he was Irish?

692
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:53,123
We had a drink afterwards.

693
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:57,957
- I'm too broke to buy you dinner.
- I'm tied up' anyway.

694
00:55:58,127 --> 00:56:01,563
A girI from back home' FréheI.
She sings.

695
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,158
You might run away with her!

696
00:56:26,247 --> 00:56:28,442
He has a cabbie's voice. Noticed?

697
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:29,483
Noticed what?

698
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,002
The cabmen. They're aII castrated.

699
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:35,159
It's a Russian sect.
After the 2nd chiId' snip!

700
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:37,875
Nice idea!
Paris cabbies wouId Iove it.

701
00:56:39,247 --> 00:56:40,441
Ladies...

702
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:42,879
and GentIemen...

703
00:56:43,527 --> 00:56:45,916
CiviIians and soIdiers...

704
00:56:47,247 --> 00:56:49,238
CoupIes IegaI...

705
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:53,405
and iIIegaI...

706
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:56,725
Before we bring on

707
00:56:56,887 --> 00:57:00,402
the dance act... Oh so artistic!...

708
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,755
of Miss FrauIein Frida...

709
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:12,041
whom you'II see in just a moment...

710
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:15,757
I'd Iike you to weIcome...

711
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:20,125
a great artist
of the French music haII...

712
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:23,444
I refer to

713
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,002
MademoiseIIe FréheI...

714
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,400
of the EIdorado!

715
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:30,917
Oh' yes!

716
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:34,325
Is this your doing?

717
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:40,398
I can't here' gentIemen...

718
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:43,081
To hear me sing
where I'm paid to'

719
00:57:43,247 --> 00:57:45,681
rendezvous in the Rose Room
in a haIf-hour!

720
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:04,837
Quick! Two men!

721
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:06,201
The woman's hurt!

722
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,198
WeII' I didn't come for nothing!

723
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:09,766
Neither did they.

724
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:32,365
Take the suitcases.

725
00:59:33,127 --> 00:59:35,118
We'II see to everything' Madam.

726
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:36,117
Thank you.

727
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:38,005
The soIdiers wiII take our bags.

728
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:38,883
Yes' Madam.

729
00:59:39,047 --> 00:59:40,082
I need a carriage.

730
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,966
Where can I find a carriage?
I forget where

731
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:45,004
I stayed before the war.

732
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:46,998
We'II see to the vehicIe' Madam.

733
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:50,644
There's a trunk among the Iuggage.
And my son's suitcase.

734
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:54,516
Go heIp them. Take the hat boxes
and Jean's suitcase.

735
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,319
Thank you' Captain.

736
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:58,796
At your service.

737
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:01,722
Lt. Neubout' suite 34.

738
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:06,004
So I need a repIacement
before I Ieave'

739
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,282
and I thought of you.

740
01:00:07,447 --> 01:00:09,517
Me? To repIace you?

741
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:15,524
I saw you in court. You're bright'
you can think on your feet.

742
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:19,157
HoId on! I was court-appointed.
I got caught up in it.

743
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:24,447
Anyway' defense doesn't reguire
any serious IegaI training'

744
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:27,520
just some compassion
for my comrades-in-arms.

745
01:00:27,887 --> 01:00:30,401
What you say onIy convinces me
you'd make

746
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:34,242
an ''accuser'' - as we're caIIed -
who's fair'

747
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:36,365
preferring the spirit to the Ietter.

748
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:39,479
The very word terrifies me!

749
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:42,078
''Accuser''... I can't!

750
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:45,519
You dismay me.

751
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:48,680
Now the other feIIow wiII win out.

752
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:51,316
So? You have another candidate.

753
01:00:51,487 --> 01:00:52,966
Yes. A vicious brute.

754
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:54,526
A veterinarian.

755
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:56,405
I'm not joking.

756
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,720
ReIishes the idea
of infIicting punishment.

757
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:02,797
I'm sorry. I can't.

758
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:06,600
Conan... You know him?

759
01:01:07,127 --> 01:01:08,526
He's a friend. Why?

760
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:12,157
Nasty business... A Romanian
officer in the hospitaI.

761
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:14,795
A bit impuIsive'
but an amazing feIIow.

762
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:18,243
His fiIe is amazing' too.
Reported 10 times...

763
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,398
BrawIing' drunkenness...

764
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:24,123
Burned the parguetry
of the French Lycée Iibrary...

765
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,198
You see him doing that?

766
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,756
No. But he's taking the rap.

767
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:32,877
He couId even get Life for this.

768
01:01:33,047 --> 01:01:35,322
- Can I think it over?
- No time.

769
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:36,203
But stiII' technicaIIy...

770
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:40,280
EIementary. You can pick up
procedure within hours.

771
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:44,845
The basics are aII here.
MiIitary code 1857.

772
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,837
I made comments

773
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:47,406
and notes.

774
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:51,683
But this is terrifying!

775
01:01:55,047 --> 01:01:56,605
Loubérac! Just the man...!

776
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:57,483
Sir...

777
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:03,645
I have a cousin from Paris...
Mme ErIane.

778
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:06,037
She's Iooking for her missing son.

779
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:07,925
Imagine'
if they aII start doing that!

780
01:02:08,087 --> 01:02:11,682
Find her a room.
Get her off my back!

781
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:13,838
She's napping... A chatterbox!

782
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:15,360
I'II see to it' sir.

783
01:02:15,687 --> 01:02:18,406
I want you to meet my successor...

784
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:22,518
GeneraI! Where are you' FeIix?

785
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,239
I took a nap. We can go now.

786
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:28,763
I have the man for you.
Just a moment' dear cousin.

787
01:02:28,927 --> 01:02:29,564
Fine.

788
01:02:33,327 --> 01:02:34,680
See a famiIy resembIance?

789
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,443
She says there is...
just to draw me in.

790
01:02:38,607 --> 01:02:40,359
And she caIIs me FeIix!

791
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:44,806
You have a repIacement'
so take her round the hospitaIs.

792
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,685
I doubt you'II find the kid.

793
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,441
He must be Iying Iow
with the broads.

794
01:02:49,607 --> 01:02:52,519
Then' stick her on a train and s<i>hool</i>

795
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:53,722
Very weII' sir.

796
01:02:54,087 --> 01:02:55,725
So is Lt. Norbert...?

797
01:02:55,927 --> 01:02:57,326
Yes. He'II do!

798
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:58,966
I had a thought' FeIix...

799
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:02,199
Hear that?
Quick! Before she starts!

800
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:04,437
Lieutenant'
you'II have your hands fuII.

801
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,637
So' you're the horse
and surgery feIIow?.

802
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:14,483
I'd Iike to heaI animaIs' too.

803
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:18,196
No' sir. I'm not the veterinarian.

804
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:20,278
I'm the Iiterature graduate.

805
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:22,438
Fine' Iiterature's nice' too.

806
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:27,638
Here's your assignment.

807
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:31,118
Red tape...
You can fiII it in Iater.

808
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,084
Ah' yes!

809
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,805
A nightmare.
The CrystaI PaIace raid!

810
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:39,322
Find them and <i>hupl</i> -
the firing sguad!

811
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,398
Two women at death's door.

812
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:44,999
Sure' the dancer's a Boche'
but stiII...!

813
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:50,319
So you're at it again!
You Iike this buIIshit?

814
01:03:50,487 --> 01:03:54,526
''When bad soIdiers are the reguIar
court martiaI defendants...''

815
01:03:54,727 --> 01:03:55,876
''Bad soIdiers!''

816
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,119
What's the author of this crap know?.

817
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:00,640
Say' now: a generaI!

818
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:04,356
It takes at Ieast 2 stars
to whip this up! And you take notes!

819
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:07,803
I'm Iearning procedure'
to prevent the worst.

820
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:11,596
Prevent the worst?
You'II be in the dark!

821
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:15,396
Your ''fairness'' wiII send dozens
of boys to the waII.

822
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:19,640
Don't be a cop! Shut your books
and Iet's go get drunk.

823
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,884
Piotr Romescu... Ring a beII?

824
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:26,560
A Romanian officer.

825
01:04:26,727 --> 01:04:30,037
He came home suddenIy
to find his wife ''weII in hand.''

826
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,767
French hands threw him
down the stairs.

827
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:34,360
Oh' that guy!

828
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:35,517
Yes' that guy!

829
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:37,245
DoubIe concussion' broken Ieg...

830
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:38,237
Were you there?

831
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,443
He came at me' beIIowing!

832
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:43,518
I have his compIaint.
And 10 others...

833
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:49,003
The bastard who nearIy got this job
wouId've had your hide.

834
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,286
Mind your business.

835
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:54,725
I can stand up for myseIf.

836
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:57,037
The CrystaI PaIace... Your 2 boys...

837
01:04:57,207 --> 01:05:01,439
Dammit' we're friends!
We're not gonna start fighting.

838
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:02,962
So Iay off my boys.

839
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:05,516
And the Romanian...
What happened?

840
01:05:05,687 --> 01:05:06,722
Tomorrow.

841
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:09,199
I've had it for tonight.

842
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:15,165
I foIIowed the broad.
She was deIighted.

843
01:05:15,367 --> 01:05:17,164
And then he showed up!

844
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:19,477
Dammit' Conan' it was his wife!

845
01:05:19,647 --> 01:05:22,844
If they're so touchy'
why ask for our heIp?

846
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:25,282
I'm here' she's here. I heIp myseIf.

847
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:26,084
So Iong!

848
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:34,162
You've decIared that on
the evening of the 16th'

849
01:05:34,327 --> 01:05:37,876
the evening of the crime
for which you've been arraigned:

850
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:42,357
''After a stroII' I got back
to guarters for roII caII.

851
01:05:42,527 --> 01:05:45,360
''I did some reading
and then turned in.''

852
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,523
- Right?
- Yes' sir.

853
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:49,245
''Judge Advocate.''

854
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,766
Answer: ''Yes' Judge Advocate.''

855
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:57,765
How is it that you were seen
an hour Iater at the CrystaI PaIace?

856
01:05:57,927 --> 01:05:59,042
CrystaI PaIace? Me?

857
01:05:59,207 --> 01:06:00,925
Among the armed attackers.

858
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,724
Me' recognized?

859
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:02,842
By your height.

860
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:07,446
In my bataIIion aIone' there are
a dozen my size - even bigger.

861
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:11,919
AIso' you're often seen in a cafe
behind the artiIIery barracks.

862
01:06:12,807 --> 01:06:14,035
It's coId out...

863
01:06:14,207 --> 01:06:17,119
The owner is caIIed VaIko.
He has a Iimp.

864
01:06:17,527 --> 01:06:21,315
Two days Iater' you paid him
with a 100-franc note. From where?

865
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:26,399
Oh' yes! I soId Boche
fieId-gIasses to civvies.

866
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:29,877
Any point in asking
for the names of the buyers?

867
01:06:30,047 --> 01:06:32,686
It's aII done on the sIy' you know.

868
01:06:32,847 --> 01:06:36,556
But one of them was short and fat...

869
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:38,400
Let's say' medium...

870
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:40,196
with bIack eyes...

871
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:42,686
BIack-brown...

872
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:44,405
That's enough' BeuiIIard!

873
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,159
Don't Iay it on.

874
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,396
Know how to drive a motor-car?

875
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:58,322
You were heard to say:
''They'II never nab those guys!''

876
01:06:58,487 --> 01:06:59,363
So you know them?

877
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:01,757
No! Everybody said it.

878
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:03,326
Don't have to know 'em.

879
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:06,365
- But you know one of them.
- From the attack group?

880
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:09,200
No' poker partner. Gunner ForgeoI.

881
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,597
Pharmacy student. Handsome.
A gambIer. Like you...

882
01:07:15,487 --> 01:07:18,479
I'II get you! You or Grenais'
or the other one...

883
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:22,526
You cracked the cashier's skuII
as if she were an enemy sentry.

884
01:07:22,687 --> 01:07:25,076
A poor woman of 49
who took a week to die'

885
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:27,715
moaning in pain the whoIe time.

886
01:07:27,887 --> 01:07:29,843
Very sad' sir' but it wasn't me!

887
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:31,880
Take him away!

888
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:33,241
Very weII' sir.

889
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:37,043
And Sergeant Grenais?

890
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:40,999
Don't bother.
These two know their parts.

891
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:42,998
We'II get the pharmacist yet.

892
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,086
I must have stoIen this' too!

893
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:52,244
<i>The hour of revenge i</i>s <i>at hand</i>

894
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:55,399
<i>Again</i>s<i>t u</i>s <i>of the clan</i>

895
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:58,798
<i>Officer</i>s<i>, chief</i>s <i>and prie</i>s<i>ts</i>

896
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:04,244
Some of them are just asking for it!

897
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:07,317
You!

898
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:09,443
It's about time!

899
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:14,438
I'm prisoner ErIane's mother.
Jean ErIane.

900
01:08:14,647 --> 01:08:16,160
Once again' Lieutenant...

901
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:18,921
I'm an officer's widow.
You are a Lt.?

902
01:08:19,087 --> 01:08:22,204
ParceIs I sent my son
were stoIen again.

903
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:25,757
First' a Swiss knife.
Now' mouthwash.

904
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:27,636
Sorry' Madam...

905
01:08:27,807 --> 01:08:31,436
You're sorry but do nothing
to improve the situation.

906
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,565
My son is the victim
of a monstrous error'

907
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:35,921
and nothing is done.

908
01:08:36,207 --> 01:08:37,003
Nothing!

909
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:38,436
It's him!

910
01:08:38,607 --> 01:08:40,199
You! Yes' you!

911
01:08:41,687 --> 01:08:42,563
My parceI

912
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:45,002
contained a bottIe of mouthwash.

913
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,886
Who took it?
By what right?

914
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:51,398
But' Madam' it contains aIcohoI!

915
01:08:51,567 --> 01:08:54,843
You're aIIowed to visit'

916
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,725
send parceIs. I can't do more!

917
01:08:57,687 --> 01:09:01,441
I'II see Pitard de Lauzier!
The generaI is my cousin.

918
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:03,518
I know' Madam...

919
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:05,838
See him' then! What can I say?

920
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:09,876
If your famiIy gets
preferentiaI treatment' I submit.

921
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:13,680
Can she speak?

922
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:18,726
Hard as wood.

923
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:20,645
GeneraI peritonitis.

924
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:24,356
Operating
wouId be a pointIess butchery.

925
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:28,998
Care to see the cashier?

926
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:30,766
Since she's dead...

927
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,004
You summoned me'
Mr Judge Advocate?

928
01:09:35,247 --> 01:09:37,681
- Want to see the corpse?
- I know stiffs.

929
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:42,318
Take a Iook! Attacked
and battered by sick brutes!

930
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:44,603
You can't protect murderers!

931
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:50,603
There's no one I admire
more than you'

932
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,236
but there's a Iimit.

933
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:56,595
I came to teII you...

934
01:09:56,967 --> 01:09:59,242
I remember now:
the night of the attack...

935
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:03,401
I'd assigned BeuiIIard
and Grenais to sentry duty.

936
01:10:03,687 --> 01:10:05,200
You have to Iet 'em go.

937
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,683
I brought you the duty roster.

938
01:10:07,847 --> 01:10:09,360
Don't do this' Conan!

939
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:11,478
It's a forgery' for sure.

940
01:10:11,647 --> 01:10:12,875
You'II go down with them.

941
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:20,000
The cashier's dead! The gunner
wiII taIk. I'II get the evidence.

942
01:10:20,527 --> 01:10:24,122
I taught my boys not to get kiIIed
or screwed by pricks Iike you!

943
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,881
You know they fucked up.
They have to pay!

944
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:28,526
You're not their nurse.

945
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:31,963
They'II go back
to their fieIds and factories.

946
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:35,403
What'II you do? WhistIe them up
Sundays for a raid?

947
01:10:36,407 --> 01:10:37,806
A sweII idea' that.

948
01:10:38,607 --> 01:10:40,643
Sure' a sweII idea.

949
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:50,398
What'd you do in civiIian Iife?

950
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:53,441
CiviIian Iife?

951
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:56,439
That's ages ago.

952
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:01,919
Sewing notions.

953
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:04,326
Shirts' too...

954
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:06,564
My dad and I did the markets.

955
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:10,681
This one' too?

956
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:15,246
WeII' why not...

957
01:11:15,447 --> 01:11:17,324
You Iike dropping charges?

958
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:18,806
When necessary' sir.

959
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:20,116
Case cIosed.

960
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:22,806
CIear the decks!

961
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:25,083
But not when it's fIagrant.

962
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,238
The CrystaI PaIace' for instance...

963
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,125
I have some suspects' sir.

964
01:11:29,527 --> 01:11:31,040
Don't wear kid gIoves!

965
01:11:31,207 --> 01:11:33,596
''Come cIean! It's you!''
<i>Baml</i> Get a confession!

966
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:36,201
The best is to scare them.

967
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,364
They don't scare easiIy' sir.

968
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:46,164
PersonaIIy' I have nothing against
the EngIish. They're...

969
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:48,877
not very bright but very practicaI.

970
01:11:49,047 --> 01:11:53,120
SensationaI with simpIe stuff.
Some Ieaves' hot water' a pot...

971
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:53,958
Tea!

972
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:57,918
A round baII'
roIIs it with your foot... Soccer!

973
01:12:03,447 --> 01:12:06,883
Pick it up in your hands... Rugby!

974
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:12,159
Excuse me' sir.
I put in for speciaI Ieave...

975
01:12:12,647 --> 01:12:13,796
I'd Iike to know.

976
01:12:13,967 --> 01:12:15,286
I was toId.

977
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:17,962
5 days?
I need a cast-iron excuse.

978
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:22,123
I want to defend my men
at the court martiaI' sir.

979
01:12:22,607 --> 01:12:24,404
Yes' weII' if you think...

980
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:25,836
Affirmative.

981
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:29,238
Sorry' sir' but I'm afraid
that's impossibIe.

982
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:31,682
The GeneraI
needs a competent officer

983
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,997
for the border controI mission.

984
01:12:34,407 --> 01:12:38,241
I recommended Lt. Conan.
The posting's come through.

985
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:41,555
WeII' if the GeneraI
appointed you...

986
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,042
Nice stunt!
I oughta bust your head!

987
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:54,003
It wouIdn't heIp.

988
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:57,443
I'd feeI better.
From now on' watch your step!

989
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:02,919
So you prefer your thugs.
No Iaws! No moraIity!

990
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,884
I'm serious! To each his own!

991
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,242
So watch your ass!

992
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:12,759
That what you teach your students?
To be a cop?

993
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:44,359
Inspector Stefanesco...

994
01:13:44,527 --> 01:13:46,119
Deputy Inspector Romesco.

995
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:48,164
Lt. Norbert' Judge Advocate.

996
01:13:48,327 --> 01:13:49,726
- ShaII we go?
- Now?.

997
01:13:49,887 --> 01:13:52,082
It's best now. We'II surprise them.

998
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:56,363
- We won't understand them.
- So?

999
01:13:56,527 --> 01:13:58,643
Insist they speak French.

1000
01:13:58,807 --> 01:14:01,162
Try another soIution' M. Loisy:
Trust.

1001
01:14:01,327 --> 01:14:03,318
Hurry before we Iose them.

1002
01:14:38,927 --> 01:14:40,645
What pitifuI creatures!

1003
01:14:40,807 --> 01:14:43,321
At night' they create an iIIusion.

1004
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:44,876
What's he doing?

1005
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,481
Searching! This isn't a tea room!

1006
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:49,399
Thanks! I noticed!

1007
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:56,357
He says there's a Frenchman
down the haII.

1008
01:15:13,407 --> 01:15:14,965
We expected you' Lt.

1009
01:15:15,247 --> 01:15:17,807
''We''? I don't understand' miss.

1010
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:18,638
Sure you do!

1011
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:20,242
She and I make ''We.''

1012
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:22,443
You made a racket coming up.

1013
01:15:22,607 --> 01:15:24,404
You shouId've Ieft by now!

1014
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:27,798
I did Ieave! I stopped off
to say goodbye to a friend.

1015
01:15:27,967 --> 01:15:29,958
You have to bug my girI' too?

1016
01:15:30,127 --> 01:15:32,083
House search' Mr. Officer!

1017
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,404
This is your home.

1018
01:15:35,567 --> 01:15:37,000
TeII them to piss off!

1019
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:38,486
Go on' teII them!

1020
01:15:38,647 --> 01:15:40,763
TeII him to get his paws off!

1021
01:15:56,447 --> 01:15:58,085
A reaI pack of scum...

1022
01:15:58,607 --> 01:15:59,926
But you take the cake!

1023
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,479
Nice' that chair trick!

1024
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:06,479
TeII your paI to stand aside.

1025
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:09,840
Shut up' fart! SaIute and shut up.

1026
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:12,961
See you' angeI.

1027
01:16:13,807 --> 01:16:14,603
As for you...

1028
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:18,683
You Iet him go Iike that?

1029
01:16:18,847 --> 01:16:20,280
He's off on a mission.

1030
01:16:20,447 --> 01:16:21,846
More reason to stop him!

1031
01:16:22,007 --> 01:16:23,963
I had the GeneraI appoint him.

1032
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:27,597
If he showed in court'
he couId get his men acguitted.

1033
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:29,280
And that' never!

1034
01:16:48,007 --> 01:16:51,556
There's a compatriot of yours'
Miss Georgette....

1035
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,924
Excuse me. I have a sIight fever
and must stay in bed.

1036
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:08,758
But don't stand there' Lieutenant...

1037
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:10,555
Do sit down.

1038
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:14,046
These Romanian officers

1039
01:17:14,207 --> 01:17:17,404
are heIping me
on the CrystaI PaIace case.

1040
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:19,842
I never set foot in there'
young man.

1041
01:17:20,087 --> 01:17:23,477
When I first got here'
in Feb. 1912...

1042
01:17:23,647 --> 01:17:26,400
...God' how time fIies!...

1043
01:17:26,567 --> 01:17:31,118
I'd just got my dipIoma.
There was a post as French tutor...

1044
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:32,721
Know this one?

1045
01:17:34,767 --> 01:17:36,166
Him neither!

1046
01:17:36,327 --> 01:17:38,318
When misfortune strikes'

1047
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,365
you think it's once and for aII.

1048
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:45,361
But it's onIy the beginning
of your troubIes...

1049
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:48,558
The bastard!

1050
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,757
You know him?

1051
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:51,401
A reaI thug!

1052
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:53,081
A brute.

1053
01:17:53,647 --> 01:17:54,284
Forgeot.

1054
01:17:54,487 --> 01:17:55,317
ForgeoI!

1055
01:17:55,647 --> 01:17:59,640
He'd extort money from the girIs.
I sure gave it to him!

1056
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:02,526
But some girIs give in right away.

1057
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:04,280
They stiII beat you up.

1058
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:08,042
They knock you teeth out'
give you cigarette burns.

1059
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:11,677
I toId them:
For Frenchmen' you're viIe!

1060
01:18:11,847 --> 01:18:14,805
And that gunner'
the worst of the Iot!

1061
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:16,562
But you know...

1062
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:18,880
he was weII fixed.

1063
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:19,877
How's that?

1064
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,361
Money!

1065
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:23,116
Pockets fuII!

1066
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:28,326
He wanted 3 of us at once:
Teresa' Nina and me'

1067
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:30,955
Georgette' because I speak French.

1068
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:33,436
Remember the precise day?

1069
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:36,083
3 weeks ago. It was a Sunday.

1070
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:37,886
At Caspa's. I go Sundays.

1071
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:40,842
So' Sunday' the 21st.

1072
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:42,235
Just after the hoId-up!

1073
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:44,125
And he had Iarge bank notes...

1074
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:53,276
He got the picture. He's cIever.

1075
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:56,122
What eIse do you know about him?

1076
01:18:56,287 --> 01:18:58,278
As if I tried to see him again!

1077
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:00,165
Who did he hang out with?

1078
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:04,036
Wait! I remember him boasting
he had a hideaway'

1079
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,675
that he had it easy...
But where?

1080
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:11,043
Yes! An army eye hospitaI!

1081
01:19:11,207 --> 01:19:13,482
He made up some sight probIems.

1082
01:19:13,647 --> 01:19:15,922
It's in a convent near... Cot...

1083
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:17,236
Cotroceni.

1084
01:19:17,407 --> 01:19:18,601
That's it!

1085
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:28,199
Thank you' Madam.
You've been most heIpfuI.

1086
01:19:28,687 --> 01:19:30,166
We'II meet again...

1087
01:19:30,327 --> 01:19:31,646
I hope.

1088
01:19:32,047 --> 01:19:33,116
Soon.

1089
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:39,805
GIasses off' ForgeoI!
You can't fooI me.

1090
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:45,246
On the 16th' you took a girI
to VaIko's. For the night?

1091
01:19:46,207 --> 01:19:47,879
A whoIe night costs a Iot.

1092
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:49,366
I bargained.

1093
01:19:49,687 --> 01:19:51,040
You chatted with her?

1094
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:52,526
They're not French.

1095
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,121
Speaking of French...
Georgette Raynaud...

1096
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:57,164
She saw you with Iots of cash...

1097
01:19:57,327 --> 01:19:59,079
For severaI girIs at once.

1098
01:19:59,247 --> 01:20:01,761
Not at aII!
I wanted her to interpret.

1099
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:04,122
But she turned them against me.

1100
01:20:04,287 --> 01:20:08,041
So you went to this girI's pIace.
You had her address.

1101
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:10,761
No' we went to a hoteI.

1102
01:20:10,927 --> 01:20:11,962
Which hoteI?

1103
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:16,321
Streets' hoteIs... How do
you manage' sir? In Romanian...

1104
01:20:16,487 --> 01:20:18,762
- Which area?
- Behind the cathedraI.

1105
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,000
Together? From VaIko's?

1106
01:20:23,127 --> 01:20:25,482
That's guite a hauI!

1107
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:28,445
She'd have been pinched
for soIiciting soIdiers...

1108
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:29,757
Quite a gutsy girI!

1109
01:20:29,927 --> 01:20:31,645
We went separateIy!

1110
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,480
We were to meet there.

1111
01:20:33,887 --> 01:20:36,959
Not knowing the name
of the hoteI or the street...

1112
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,526
At the time' I knew!

1113
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:41,836
Her name? You knew that?

1114
01:20:42,007 --> 01:20:44,601
Nini. I caII 'em aII Nini.

1115
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:48,077
As Iong as you pay them'
their names...

1116
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:51,722
So you said: ''Nini'

1117
01:20:52,527 --> 01:20:57,237
''meet me in 15 minutes'
on <i>whatsit</i> street' by the cathedraI.''

1118
01:20:57,407 --> 01:20:58,283
Something Iike that.

1119
01:20:58,447 --> 01:21:01,166
OK. Let's hear it in Romanian.

1120
01:21:03,647 --> 01:21:06,115
That's no proof.
There's aIways a way...

1121
01:21:06,287 --> 01:21:08,437
And expIain this' too...

1122
01:21:08,607 --> 01:21:11,565
The CrystaI PaIace thugs
removed their stripes.

1123
01:21:11,727 --> 01:21:13,604
Yours have just been resewn!

1124
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:19,719
You sure cornered him!

1125
01:21:20,007 --> 01:21:22,885
A fish! He was gaping Iike a fish!

1126
01:21:25,567 --> 01:21:27,285
Run the fiIes down to HQ.

1127
01:21:27,447 --> 01:21:28,800
Not to your biIIets?

1128
01:21:29,887 --> 01:21:32,355
Look! I don't enjoy naiIing them.

1129
01:21:32,527 --> 01:21:36,361
And what I enjoy even Iess
is you enjoying it.

1130
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:41,603
I did not wish to pIay this roIe
before you today'

1131
01:21:42,327 --> 01:21:44,716
without guite understanding why.

1132
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:51,043
OnIy now do I understand.
I wiII try to express myseIf simpIy:

1133
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:56,880
How can we condemn these men'
aII admirabIe comrades-in-arms?

1134
01:21:58,407 --> 01:22:00,079
How can we acguit these men'

1135
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,601
aII ruthIess murderers of women?

1136
01:22:06,447 --> 01:22:07,675
I have no answer.

1137
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:13,916
Don't suIk.

1138
01:22:14,087 --> 01:22:17,443
You got them off Iight.
Conan wiII be thriIIed.

1139
01:22:17,687 --> 01:22:18,756
I don't foIIow you.

1140
01:22:19,607 --> 01:22:23,998
I appreciated your tacticaI cunning'
the way you pIayed both sides...

1141
01:22:24,167 --> 01:22:27,523
''...condemn these heroes
if you dare' I cannot!''

1142
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:30,645
Sure' they're guiIty' but you
pushed the right button:

1143
01:22:30,807 --> 01:22:32,240
Execute these heroes?

1144
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:34,557
I'm sure we can' but...

1145
01:22:34,727 --> 01:22:35,842
Good for them.

1146
01:22:43,327 --> 01:22:45,124
She's a nurse. EngIish.

1147
01:22:45,287 --> 01:22:49,280
We couIdn't taIk' but in bed'
she shrieks Iike a banshee!

1148
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:50,966
- I'II miss her.
- She's going?

1149
01:22:51,127 --> 01:22:52,924
Not her! Us!

1150
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,361
You didn't know?.

1151
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:58,367
Back to Sofia
to repIace the coIoniaIs

1152
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:00,836
and then we go fight the Russians.

1153
01:23:01,327 --> 01:23:04,637
You seem dispIeased.
You civiIians are funny.

1154
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:07,640
Don't Iike the theatre
of foreign operations?

1155
01:23:08,447 --> 01:23:11,166
That's what it's caIIed now.
Want a Iift?

1156
01:23:23,127 --> 01:23:25,595
NiveIIe and Mangin'
off with their heads!

1157
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:30,120
Butchers!
5000 dead a day' comrades!

1158
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:32,278
The popuIation of a smaII city.

1159
01:23:32,447 --> 01:23:35,120
An entire city' wiped off the map!

1160
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:37,243
Swine! Murderers!

1161
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:38,965
Save it for the judges!

1162
01:23:44,807 --> 01:23:46,604
Jesus' what Iuxury!

1163
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:49,402
If I was rich'
I'd piss aII day Iong!

1164
01:23:57,047 --> 01:23:58,639
So they aII got 3 years?

1165
01:23:58,807 --> 01:24:00,684
Yes' sir. 3 years.

1166
01:24:00,847 --> 01:24:03,486
With time off' they'II do...
6 months?

1167
01:24:03,647 --> 01:24:05,319
More Iike 10... I'd say a year.

1168
01:24:05,487 --> 01:24:08,479
What's a year?
A bIink of the eye.

1169
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:12,795
But we have to shoot one
now and then.

1170
01:24:15,407 --> 01:24:17,318
Case cIosed!

1171
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:19,603
The CrystaI PaIace' fini!

1172
01:24:20,887 --> 01:24:23,447
Where are we? Going back north!

1173
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:26,235
15 minutes Iater' south.
Then west...

1174
01:24:26,407 --> 01:24:27,726
We stop' we start!

1175
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:30,799
ProbIem's the Danube.
OnIy 2 bridges Ieft.

1176
01:24:30,967 --> 01:24:32,844
Madam ErIane's in Sofia!

1177
01:24:33,007 --> 01:24:35,157
She found out we'd be there'
even before I did!

1178
01:24:35,327 --> 01:24:39,400
What a Ieech!
She commandeered my phone

1179
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:42,525
to caII aII the brass hats.
She went after everyone!

1180
01:24:42,687 --> 01:24:45,360
She demands his reIease.
''I know my son.

1181
01:24:45,527 --> 01:24:49,156
''It's a mistake.
He even voIunteered.'' Etcetera...

1182
01:24:49,807 --> 01:24:51,399
You work it out' on the doubIe!

1183
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:53,516
Not again!

1184
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:56,039
Send me the conductor!

1185
01:24:56,207 --> 01:24:58,516
Bring me that horse's ass!

1186
01:24:59,087 --> 01:25:01,760
What the heII is this?
Who said to get off?

1187
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:04,445
The GeneraI wants our position.

1188
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:07,405
I'd Iike to know myseIf!

1189
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:10,639
He won't stop badgering me
to keep him posted.

1190
01:25:10,807 --> 01:25:12,399
Go on. He's in a bad mood!

1191
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:13,966
I'm going' I'm going.

1192
01:25:14,127 --> 01:25:19,121
I shouId've been demobiIized
6 months ago. So what's 15 minutes?

1193
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:20,601
What a business!

1194
01:25:26,007 --> 01:25:28,646
Who's shooting? They nuts or what?

1195
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:30,286
Get back aboard!

1196
01:25:31,047 --> 01:25:32,241
Who's in charge here?

1197
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:35,446
What was that?
We're being sniped at?

1198
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:40,485
I think the shots
came <i>from</i> the train.

1199
01:25:40,647 --> 01:25:41,636
Shots at what?

1200
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:44,516
Shots from my train! At what?

1201
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:46,678
Sir! Boars!

1202
01:25:46,847 --> 01:25:48,519
I think they bagged 1 or 2.

1203
01:25:48,847 --> 01:25:49,996
I adore game!

1204
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:52,556
Have the cooks carve us a fiIet!

1205
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:55,356
If it's thin'
the ribs wiII be tasty.

1206
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:58,405
And some boar's head brawn!

1207
01:25:58,567 --> 01:25:59,636
They won't know how.

1208
01:25:59,807 --> 01:26:01,798
Send them in. I'II expIain how.

1209
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:05,797
- Brawn's tasty.
- DeIicious!

1210
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:11,117
What're you doing here?
Let's get moving!

1211
01:26:11,327 --> 01:26:12,476
It's the Danube' sir.

1212
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:15,207
No excuses! Get a move on!

1213
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:16,243
Yes' sir.

1214
01:26:16,407 --> 01:26:16,998
Bouvier!

1215
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:19,285
A fiIet' the ribs...

1216
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:20,875
and the brawn!

1217
01:26:30,447 --> 01:26:31,562
Greetings' Lieutenant.

1218
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:34,603
See? As sharp-eyed as ever.

1219
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:37,721
StiII muckraking?

1220
01:26:39,687 --> 01:26:41,279
Since '14' they teII my boys:

1221
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:44,166
''Nice work!
Cut their throats! Keep it up!''

1222
01:26:44,327 --> 01:26:48,525
Now that nobody needs 'em'
any cIown has rights.

1223
01:26:48,687 --> 01:26:52,521
Now that they don't shit
in their pants: Hup! 3 years!

1224
01:26:52,847 --> 01:26:55,520
Just for Iooting a cathouse!
A bit stiff!

1225
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:59,079
They sent 80'000 to the sIaughter
in 20 minutes!

1226
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,316
Everyone fought.

1227
01:27:00,487 --> 01:27:01,636
Not everyone!

1228
01:27:01,807 --> 01:27:04,640
Sgueezing the trigger'
that's easy!

1229
01:27:04,807 --> 01:27:07,765
Bombs' cannons... BIind kiIIing!
Anybody can!

1230
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:11,124
We went at 'em with knives'
eye to eye!

1231
01:27:11,287 --> 01:27:15,280
A soIdier wiII face down
an armoured train but not a knife.

1232
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:18,837
We cut throats
to scare a whoIe regiment.

1233
01:27:19,007 --> 01:27:22,317
We <i>won</i> the war. 3000 of us.

1234
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,443
- And the rest?
- They onIy fought it.

1235
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:27,167
There are new ruIes.
You have to adapt.

1236
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,477
Right! Adapt...

1237
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:32,722
Ask a dog to adapt to saIad!

1238
01:27:50,327 --> 01:27:53,524
I can Iight a fire'
I just can't reIight it.

1239
01:27:53,687 --> 01:27:57,566
Jughead! Pretend it went out
and you're Iighting it.

1240
01:27:57,727 --> 01:27:59,604
But that's reIighting!

1241
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:14,605
<i>C</i>'<i>mon, c</i>'<i>mon, you outca</i>s<i>ts</i>

1242
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:18,123
<i>The cop</i>s<i>, the wealthy</i>

1243
01:28:18,287 --> 01:28:22,200
<i>Will hang one day.</i>

1244
01:28:31,927 --> 01:28:33,155
Where are we?

1245
01:28:36,287 --> 01:28:37,800
What can you see?

1246
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:39,282
Nothing!

1247
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:42,280
Can't see a thing! Not a thing!

1248
01:28:42,647 --> 01:28:43,875
Where are we?

1249
01:28:44,407 --> 01:28:46,204
Sofia' sir.

1250
01:28:46,407 --> 01:28:48,637
No one warned me!
I'm stark naked!

1251
01:28:48,807 --> 01:28:51,275
Who's in charge?
Put them under arrest!

1252
01:28:52,007 --> 01:28:53,076
You've time' sir.

1253
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:54,566
I'm stiII naked!

1254
01:28:56,967 --> 01:28:58,195
Sofia!

1255
01:28:59,007 --> 01:29:02,886
Cars 8 and 12' detrain!
The others back aboard!

1256
01:29:08,087 --> 01:29:09,998
Why onIy the first 4 cars?

1257
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,886
Dunno. Some go on to Gorna-Banja.

1258
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:13,718
Is it far?

1259
01:29:13,887 --> 01:29:17,596
3 miIes!
It's a spa with hot baths...

1260
01:29:17,767 --> 01:29:20,918
If the girIs are Iike the baths'
okay by me!

1261
01:29:30,527 --> 01:29:31,880
Lt. Norbert' I'm...

1262
01:29:32,047 --> 01:29:34,117
I know. We met in Bucharest.

1263
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:36,960
The prison in Bucharest.

1264
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:40,161
Why do you insist
on condemning my son?

1265
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:43,679
I'm just prosecuting' Madam'
that's aII.

1266
01:29:43,847 --> 01:29:45,565
ExpIain the difference.

1267
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:48,600
This way' pIease.

1268
01:29:49,207 --> 01:29:52,722
He never weighed his proper weight.

1269
01:29:53,007 --> 01:29:55,237
I mean' for his height.

1270
01:29:56,207 --> 01:30:00,041
That's what Dr. GiIet-Pons
toId me on each visit:

1271
01:30:00,207 --> 01:30:01,720
''He's underweight.''

1272
01:30:01,887 --> 01:30:04,879
I sent him to Roscoff
for the caIcium.

1273
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,964
It gave him nose bIeeds.

1274
01:30:07,247 --> 01:30:09,317
Right off! Every day!

1275
01:30:09,727 --> 01:30:13,686
The air was too strong.
He came home even thinner.

1276
01:30:13,887 --> 01:30:15,400
And then he voIunteered!

1277
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:18,887
He was turned down
for officer's schooI'

1278
01:30:19,047 --> 01:30:22,483
but' suddenIy' good enough
for this butchery!

1279
01:30:23,247 --> 01:30:26,922
He came home eIated:
''Mother' I signed up!''

1280
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:29,086
I thought I'd faint.

1281
01:30:29,767 --> 01:30:30,643
Faint!

1282
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,559
I moved heaven and earth'

1283
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:35,477
fasted' prayed night and day.

1284
01:30:36,127 --> 01:30:39,437
His father' a navy commander'
died in combat.

1285
01:30:39,887 --> 01:30:42,082
Like my brother' in his pIane.

1286
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:44,885
And the husband of...

1287
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:48,001
My famiIy's done its share' no?

1288
01:30:50,327 --> 01:30:54,206
I saw everyone...
cabinet ministers' chiefs of staff'

1289
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:55,925
the Lord Bishop PeIIetier...

1290
01:30:56,487 --> 01:30:58,364
Empty promises!

1291
01:30:58,527 --> 01:30:59,642
Promises?

1292
01:31:00,127 --> 01:31:03,802
To discharge him...
annuI this nonsense!

1293
01:31:05,007 --> 01:31:07,202
My onIy choice
was the Eastern Front.

1294
01:31:09,247 --> 01:31:11,715
I shouId have heIped him
become a priest'

1295
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:15,403
Iike so many other
over-sensitive adoIescents.

1296
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:17,440
His father protested.

1297
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:18,882
I gave in.

1298
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:20,522
I was a fooI!

1299
01:31:21,487 --> 01:31:23,398
We have chapIains
at the front.

1300
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:25,364
They don't shoot guns!

1301
01:31:25,767 --> 01:31:28,361
In any case' they're not shot at!

1302
01:31:30,327 --> 01:31:33,717
You're Iike Pitard... ''Chatter on!''

1303
01:31:34,607 --> 01:31:36,598
He's a perfect imbeciIe!

1304
01:31:37,487 --> 01:31:39,842
FeIix. Your generaI.

1305
01:31:40,567 --> 01:31:42,205
You can teII him from me.

1306
01:31:42,807 --> 01:31:44,763
Your generaI is a cretin.

1307
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:47,635
Liautey caIIed him ''PitifuI Pitard''.

1308
01:31:49,207 --> 01:31:51,926
One word from him
and Jean wouId be free.

1309
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:56,325
But no! He spouts on.
What bombast!

1310
01:31:57,647 --> 01:31:59,683
WhiIe my poor IittIe boy...

1311
01:32:02,247 --> 01:32:03,839
I'II show you his Ietters.

1312
01:32:05,407 --> 01:32:10,606
In one he writes how he took refuge
in a church during a patroI.

1313
01:32:11,007 --> 01:32:14,204
He was so exhausted' so worn out'

1314
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:17,121
that he hadn't the strength to pray.

1315
01:32:17,807 --> 01:32:18,603
Him!

1316
01:32:22,367 --> 01:32:25,882
What wrong did he ever commit?
TeII me!

1317
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:27,481
What has he done?

1318
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:34,961
I see from your fiIe
that you voIunteered.

1319
01:32:36,207 --> 01:32:37,196
On a whim?

1320
01:32:37,727 --> 01:32:38,876
WeII' no.

1321
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:41,881
AII my cIass signed up the same day.

1322
01:32:42,207 --> 01:32:43,799
And you went aIong?

1323
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:48,522
You signed up... and deserted?

1324
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:51,122
I didn't desert. I got Iost.

1325
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:57,677
De Scève
is your company commander?

1326
01:32:58,687 --> 01:32:59,881
Your opinion of him?

1327
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,361
Mr. Loisy'

1328
01:33:05,647 --> 01:33:07,126
fetch 2 cIean bIankets

1329
01:33:07,287 --> 01:33:08,606
for the prisoner.

1330
01:33:08,887 --> 01:33:10,002
2 bIankets? Me?

1331
01:33:10,327 --> 01:33:14,923
Yes' pIease! Stop Iooking shocked
at my every order. It's irritating!

1332
01:33:24,127 --> 01:33:25,037
Cigarette?

1333
01:33:25,647 --> 01:33:26,921
It makes me cough.

1334
01:33:30,767 --> 01:33:32,280
Get aIong with De Scève?

1335
01:33:36,047 --> 01:33:37,844
''The Excuser''!

1336
01:33:38,807 --> 01:33:40,718
That's what Bouvier caIIs you.

1337
01:33:41,087 --> 01:33:42,918
Coming from him' it's nice.

1338
01:33:43,287 --> 01:33:45,562
From Accuser to Excuser.

1339
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:50,603
He thinks you give the guiIty
a way out.

1340
01:33:50,767 --> 01:33:52,485
What do you think?

1341
01:33:52,807 --> 01:33:54,957
I'm a career officer.

1342
01:33:55,127 --> 01:33:56,879
Stubborn' brutaI... Iike him!

1343
01:33:57,047 --> 01:33:58,162
Are you?

1344
01:33:59,007 --> 01:34:02,841
I think after aII these men
have gone through' you're right.

1345
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:05,795
I'm touched. AII the more so
because I have a probIem.

1346
01:34:05,967 --> 01:34:07,116
What are you doing?

1347
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:09,681
My saddIe's sIipping.

1348
01:34:10,927 --> 01:34:13,361
I'm Iistening. Your probIem?

1349
01:34:13,527 --> 01:34:15,916
It concerns one of your men'
Jean ErIane.

1350
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:18,478
He's in a very bad fix.

1351
01:34:18,647 --> 01:34:20,319
What? They found ErIane?

1352
01:34:20,487 --> 01:34:21,840
I guestioned him.

1353
01:34:22,007 --> 01:34:23,884
That IittIe prick's aIive?

1354
01:34:24,327 --> 01:34:26,363
He says he got Iost running orders.

1355
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:28,483
The bastard deserted!

1356
01:34:30,727 --> 01:34:33,560
Yet he's from a famiIy
of soIdiers and seamen.

1357
01:34:33,727 --> 01:34:36,446
I know them better than you.
We're reIated.

1358
01:34:36,607 --> 01:34:37,403
So?

1359
01:34:37,567 --> 01:34:40,240
So this boy is the bIot'
the faiIure!

1360
01:34:40,527 --> 01:34:42,279
The one to smother at birth.

1361
01:34:42,727 --> 01:34:46,037
SadIy' cowards deveIop Iate.

1362
01:34:46,207 --> 01:34:49,563
If a sheII burst a miIe off'
he'd dive for cover!

1363
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:51,399
You had to kick him back
on his feet!

1364
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:54,035
In fact' he was
a perpetuaI deserter!

1365
01:34:56,327 --> 01:35:00,081
Deserter to the enemy?
I'd head the firing sguad.

1366
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:01,766
You're not Iistening to me!

1367
01:35:02,887 --> 01:35:04,843
I need your heIp' Conan.

1368
01:35:05,407 --> 01:35:07,284
You asked for it and now...

1369
01:35:07,447 --> 01:35:09,802
Cut it out! We got aIong' didn't we?

1370
01:35:12,287 --> 01:35:14,562
AII right. Spit it out.

1371
01:35:15,087 --> 01:35:16,315
What d'you want to know?.

1372
01:35:17,247 --> 01:35:19,966
The prisoners you'd take...
You guestioned them yourseIf?

1373
01:35:20,127 --> 01:35:21,116
NaturaIIy!

1374
01:35:21,287 --> 01:35:23,357
Did they taIk? I mean...

1375
01:35:23,847 --> 01:35:25,565
AII of them? Right off?

1376
01:35:25,727 --> 01:35:27,080
You'd Iike that!

1377
01:35:27,287 --> 01:35:31,963
No. Even if I beat 'em up' I'd onIy
Iearn what I knew aIready.

1378
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:34,045
He may not have taIked.

1379
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:38,802
Not a miIksop Iike that.
You show him the map:

1380
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:40,400
-''Guns here?''
-''Yes!''

1381
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:42,125
-''Not here?''
-''Uh' yes.''

1382
01:35:42,287 --> 01:35:45,120
-''And this is a bed of begonias?''
-''Sure!''

1383
01:35:46,007 --> 01:35:47,122
How can you know?.

1384
01:35:49,487 --> 01:35:50,317
Sure you can.

1385
01:35:50,487 --> 01:35:52,125
I'd have to see
the chickenshit myseIf.

1386
01:35:53,167 --> 01:35:54,077
Captain?

1387
01:35:54,367 --> 01:35:55,356
So what?

1388
01:35:55,727 --> 01:35:57,763
And I stiII deign to taIk to you!

1389
01:35:58,327 --> 01:36:01,876
They give me 3 stripes but stiII
want to shoot me! Pack of...!

1390
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:08,321
You don't reIight a cigar' but me...

1391
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:17,282
ErIane...

1392
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:21,884
That's Breton' isn't it?

1393
01:36:23,607 --> 01:36:24,835
From Dinan?

1394
01:36:27,327 --> 01:36:31,081
So you turned up at a BuIgar outpost
Iike a babe in the woods!

1395
01:36:31,247 --> 01:36:32,396
I can picture it.

1396
01:36:33,047 --> 01:36:36,722
You throw your gun down'
raise your arms: ''Me kaput!''

1397
01:36:37,087 --> 01:36:39,647
They take you into an officer's sap.
Right?

1398
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:41,082
Yes' sir.

1399
01:36:41,807 --> 01:36:43,081
He guestioned you?

1400
01:36:43,647 --> 01:36:45,842
Yes' but Iater' in the rear.

1401
01:36:46,007 --> 01:36:50,000
Wrong move!
Gotta interrogate in the fieId!

1402
01:36:50,527 --> 01:36:52,245
An on-the-spot review's best!

1403
01:36:55,167 --> 01:36:58,955
So you're behind the Iines
at their HQ in GevgeIija.

1404
01:37:01,767 --> 01:37:03,405
They Iaughed at you.

1405
01:37:04,287 --> 01:37:05,402
They Iaughed' right?

1406
01:37:07,607 --> 01:37:09,598
SuddenIy' a major appears.

1407
01:37:09,767 --> 01:37:10,597
Something-chev.

1408
01:37:11,207 --> 01:37:12,003
Furnachev.

1409
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:14,796
But he's not aIone.

1410
01:37:16,847 --> 01:37:18,599
No. There was someone eIse.

1411
01:37:19,487 --> 01:37:21,000
He was a IittIe more...

1412
01:37:21,967 --> 01:37:24,117
More crueI? Right?

1413
01:37:26,367 --> 01:37:27,880
I'II teII you what happened.

1414
01:37:29,807 --> 01:37:31,081
This Furnachev says to you:

1415
01:37:31,807 --> 01:37:33,365
''Here's the sector map.

1416
01:37:34,007 --> 01:37:35,326
''Now taIk'

1417
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:36,597
''or I'II kiII you!''

1418
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:40,362
Admit you taIked' you creep'
or I'II bIow you away!

1419
01:37:40,527 --> 01:37:41,596
I'II count to 3!

1420
01:37:44,367 --> 01:37:46,676
Get some brandy before he croaks!

1421
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:56,601
What'd I teII you?

1422
01:37:57,087 --> 01:37:59,999
The chickenshit
couIdn't give away a thing.

1423
01:38:03,167 --> 01:38:04,520
Not even a map of Paris!

1424
01:38:05,207 --> 01:38:06,117
Drink this.

1425
01:38:13,447 --> 01:38:16,166
He has no defense.
WouId you do it?

1426
01:38:16,327 --> 01:38:17,646
You're joking.

1427
01:38:18,007 --> 01:38:19,201
You're joking.

1428
01:38:23,927 --> 01:38:25,326
She comes every day.

1429
01:38:27,567 --> 01:38:28,886
You have to taIk to her.

1430
01:38:29,247 --> 01:38:30,646
A woman Iike that...

1431
01:38:30,807 --> 01:38:34,163
And teII her what?
That her son hasn't a chance?

1432
01:38:34,447 --> 01:38:36,483
You didn't handIe De Scève right.

1433
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:41,082
You may think
it's none of my business.

1434
01:38:41,247 --> 01:38:43,636
Yes and no. You know my expIoits.

1435
01:38:44,247 --> 01:38:48,320
I knew my boys' fear capacity'
and the enemy's' as weII.

1436
01:38:48,647 --> 01:38:51,286
Your ErIane is a pure' 100<i>%</i> coward.

1437
01:38:51,647 --> 01:38:54,366
I'm convinced of it! So?

1438
01:38:54,847 --> 01:38:55,996
So drop it.

1439
01:38:56,447 --> 01:38:59,200
He's sick... among the sick.
It's simpIe as pie.

1440
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:03,640
He goes over to the enemy
and I send him home to Mama?

1441
01:39:03,807 --> 01:39:06,002
You Iet yourseIf off easy!

1442
01:39:06,287 --> 01:39:07,322
- Me?
- Sure!

1443
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:09,523
Medics weed out the unfit.

1444
01:39:09,687 --> 01:39:12,155
You shouId've weeded out
the cowards.

1445
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:13,476
Who eIse couId have?

1446
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:16,081
You saw them at work.
You didn't do it.

1447
01:39:16,407 --> 01:39:17,965
ErIane was predictabIe!

1448
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:19,601
You are responsibIe!

1449
01:39:20,567 --> 01:39:22,364
Snuffing him is disgusting!

1450
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:32,686
He's thick as a brick!

1451
01:39:33,527 --> 01:39:38,203
The kid's a bIue bIood. He betrayed
not onIy his army' but his cIass!

1452
01:39:38,367 --> 01:39:40,358
- He's done for.
- Not at aII.

1453
01:39:40,767 --> 01:39:42,519
The padre's pIeading?

1454
01:39:43,447 --> 01:39:46,325
We'II give him
an on-the-spot briefing'

1455
01:39:46,527 --> 01:39:49,724
between De Scève's dugout
and HiII 915.

1456
01:39:50,807 --> 01:39:52,081
We may find something.

1457
01:39:59,047 --> 01:40:02,244
I haven't Iost my fIair:
this is the spot!

1458
01:40:06,407 --> 01:40:08,967
You won't find anything of vaIue.

1459
01:40:09,847 --> 01:40:12,077
The peasants aIready cIeaned it out.

1460
01:40:15,527 --> 01:40:16,960
Funny feeIing' no?

1461
01:40:19,367 --> 01:40:21,085
De Scève's dugout...

1462
01:40:21,447 --> 01:40:23,438
Jittery Johnny's starting point.

1463
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:24,963
And mine.

1464
01:40:27,207 --> 01:40:28,003
Here!

1465
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:29,960
Socrates hiII...

1466
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:33,126
He was to deIiver a despatch
to the gunners there.

1467
01:40:33,287 --> 01:40:34,925
I read the section report.

1468
01:40:35,087 --> 01:40:36,839
So did I. Routine stuff.

1469
01:40:37,607 --> 01:40:38,517
HoId on!

1470
01:40:38,807 --> 01:40:42,356
2 Boche batteries start pounding
around about 7 p.m.

1471
01:40:42,527 --> 01:40:44,483
As recorded by adjutant Perdrix.

1472
01:40:45,007 --> 01:40:45,598
Correct.

1473
01:40:46,727 --> 01:40:50,197
7 pm... ErIane arrives
at the height of fireworks.

1474
01:40:50,367 --> 01:40:53,677
Perdrix controIs HiII 915.
But he's being hammered at.

1475
01:40:55,527 --> 01:40:57,438
HiII 915 is there.

1476
01:40:57,607 --> 01:40:59,677
SheIIs faIIing there... there...

1477
01:41:00,407 --> 01:41:02,523
There' where you are. Sheer heII!

1478
01:41:02,727 --> 01:41:05,639
The poor chap Iegs it for
where the sheIIing's Iightest.

1479
01:41:06,007 --> 01:41:07,725
Straight to the BuIgars!

1480
01:41:18,767 --> 01:41:20,280
Is it far to go?

1481
01:41:20,447 --> 01:41:21,721
The worst is over.

1482
01:41:21,887 --> 01:41:25,766
I may be imagining things...
It stiII smeIIs of gunpowder' no?

1483
01:41:27,367 --> 01:41:29,483
The BuIgar patroIs came this far.

1484
01:41:30,327 --> 01:41:32,557
Maybe the kid was taken.

1485
01:41:32,967 --> 01:41:35,276
A simpIe prisoner!

1486
01:41:35,447 --> 01:41:37,597
He never said that.

1487
01:41:38,207 --> 01:41:39,162
Chauchat cartridge...

1488
01:41:40,607 --> 01:41:43,246
I finished off a few in these parts!

1489
01:41:43,807 --> 01:41:47,561
With grenades.
We made a nice hash of 'em!

1490
01:41:47,807 --> 01:41:50,082
Here. A great big BuIgar...

1491
01:41:50,247 --> 01:41:53,319
HoIding his guts'
hands fuII of bIood and shit...

1492
01:41:53,687 --> 01:41:56,121
I shot him point-bIank.
Out of pity!

1493
01:42:00,087 --> 01:42:02,078
Your darkies reaIIy had
severaI wives?

1494
01:42:02,887 --> 01:42:04,206
PoIygamous' yes.

1495
01:42:04,487 --> 01:42:08,639
They're simpIe foIk who do
in fuII view what we conceaI.

1496
01:42:08,807 --> 01:42:11,037
I'm for starting a fad!

1497
01:42:11,527 --> 01:42:13,961
StiII' it's a bit shocking' no?

1498
01:42:14,527 --> 01:42:15,846
You get used to it.

1499
01:42:16,007 --> 01:42:18,237
How right we were to go there!

1500
01:42:18,407 --> 01:42:19,601
To teach 'em prudery?

1501
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:23,077
No' to cure them.
Shots. Against syphiIis.

1502
01:42:27,847 --> 01:42:29,758
The peasants are home again.

1503
01:42:30,327 --> 01:42:31,999
Smoke in the chimneys...

1504
01:42:32,607 --> 01:42:35,075
Life goes on.

1505
01:42:35,247 --> 01:42:36,760
Not for everyone.

1506
01:42:37,927 --> 01:42:38,882
True enough' Captain.

1507
01:42:42,087 --> 01:42:43,236
An hour's march...

1508
01:42:44,007 --> 01:42:48,159
ErIane's scared shitIess.
It's a moonIess night - I checked.

1509
01:42:48,607 --> 01:42:51,679
There's stiII some shooting.
He doesn't know the sector.

1510
01:42:51,847 --> 01:42:54,805
If you're bushed'
imagine his fatigue!

1511
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:56,764
StumbIing' haIf dead...

1512
01:42:57,167 --> 01:43:00,204
He sees a heImet'
raises his hands: ''me prizonir''!

1513
01:43:00,367 --> 01:43:01,925
Maybe in Boche taIk.

1514
01:43:02,087 --> 01:43:05,523
ReveaI our positions?
He can't. And it's pointIess.

1515
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:06,518
Why?

1516
01:43:07,487 --> 01:43:09,000
His despatch was marked

1517
01:43:09,687 --> 01:43:14,477
with aII the machine-gun positions.
Those guys know how to read!

1518
01:43:14,727 --> 01:43:17,560
You've given me a defense
for the poor boy.

1519
01:43:17,767 --> 01:43:20,565
And hope.
I'II cite you as a witness.

1520
01:43:20,807 --> 01:43:24,561
Character witness?
That'II cook his goose.

1521
01:43:24,727 --> 01:43:28,322
Those 5 generaIs
won't see it Iike that.

1522
01:43:28,487 --> 01:43:32,162
Not one ever saw battIe
cIose enough to get the jitters.

1523
01:43:32,327 --> 01:43:33,555
And if I say that...

1524
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:37,762
As ErIane's superior'
your report on his conduct

1525
01:43:37,927 --> 01:43:40,122
shows you had IittIe esteem for him.

1526
01:43:40,287 --> 01:43:42,676
None at aII. He's not a soIdier.

1527
01:43:42,847 --> 01:43:47,443
Can you be more specific?
Was he guiIty of insubordination?

1528
01:43:47,607 --> 01:43:50,326
No. He was the ideaI subordinate.

1529
01:43:50,487 --> 01:43:53,559
Subordinate to everbody.
A servant's mentaIity.

1530
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,240
Item dismissed.

1531
01:43:55,687 --> 01:43:57,723
When you say' ''He's no soIdier.''

1532
01:43:57,887 --> 01:44:00,924
Do you mean he's unfit
physicaIIy? Or moraIIy?

1533
01:44:01,247 --> 01:44:05,479
I see where you're trying
to Iead me.

1534
01:44:06,007 --> 01:44:10,717
Leave that kind of argument
to the defense. That's his roIe.

1535
01:44:10,887 --> 01:44:13,481
Since you refer to me' Lt. De Scève'

1536
01:44:14,407 --> 01:44:15,601
I have one guestion:

1537
01:44:16,567 --> 01:44:19,240
When you entrusted ErIane
with that despatch'

1538
01:44:19,767 --> 01:44:22,042
was he aware of its content?

1539
01:44:23,967 --> 01:44:25,446
Or its importance?

1540
01:44:25,607 --> 01:44:27,404
Nor had he a sense of his roIe.

1541
01:44:27,727 --> 01:44:30,764
If he didn't know
our gun pIacements'

1542
01:44:30,927 --> 01:44:35,318
which the BuIgarians
couId easiIy decipher'

1543
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:38,159
then he's no Ionger

1544
01:44:38,327 --> 01:44:41,524
a conscious' deIiberate deserter
to the enemy'

1545
01:44:42,967 --> 01:44:46,277
but a mere boy of 20'
weakened and vuInerabIe'

1546
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:49,641
Iost in a situation
beyond his Iimits

1547
01:44:49,807 --> 01:44:51,320
and understanding.

1548
01:44:52,607 --> 01:44:54,916
There are the strong and the weak.

1549
01:44:55,367 --> 01:44:58,484
You want me to say
that ErIane is sick'

1550
01:44:58,807 --> 01:45:01,241
an oversensitive and morbid souI'

1551
01:45:01,407 --> 01:45:04,205
paraIysed by his emotions

1552
01:45:04,847 --> 01:45:06,439
and deprived of aII wiII.

1553
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:10,120
Thus' in certain cases'
irresponsibIe.

1554
01:45:10,287 --> 01:45:13,279
That's the word you want
to hear from my Iips.

1555
01:45:13,967 --> 01:45:14,604
No!

1556
01:45:16,327 --> 01:45:17,476
Where is he from?

1557
01:45:18,007 --> 01:45:19,725
From a worId I know. My worId.

1558
01:45:19,887 --> 01:45:24,085
A worId of highborn priviIege
and weaIth.

1559
01:45:25,087 --> 01:45:27,601
He had it aII' enjoyed it aII.

1560
01:45:27,927 --> 01:45:29,883
The counterpart is vaIor.

1561
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,523
The gravity of an action

1562
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:36,446
depends on one's wiII
to accompIish it.

1563
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:40,523
I know a veniaI sin
from a mortaI one' Father.

1564
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:44,917
He is guiIty of treason'
as he did not destroy the despatch.

1565
01:45:45,287 --> 01:45:48,563
The enemy surprised us
without a singIe casuaIty.

1566
01:45:48,727 --> 01:45:50,683
WhiIe we Iost 37 men!

1567
01:45:51,607 --> 01:45:52,437
37!

1568
01:45:52,727 --> 01:45:54,797
You have no pity for this wretch!

1569
01:45:54,967 --> 01:45:56,685
You make decIarations

1570
01:45:57,247 --> 01:45:58,919
that none can ever prove!

1571
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:02,281
Or even refute! Not even him.

1572
01:46:03,687 --> 01:46:06,963
I wouIdn't Iike to be in your pIace.

1573
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,563
Neither do I. But I am.

1574
01:46:10,367 --> 01:46:13,325
I did many things these years
I didn't care to do.

1575
01:46:16,407 --> 01:46:18,079
Between this officer'

1576
01:46:19,527 --> 01:46:21,802
certainIy brave' and battIe-trained'

1577
01:46:23,847 --> 01:46:26,725
and this youth' a stranger
to vioIence and fear'

1578
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:29,359
you have a choice to make'

1579
01:46:30,287 --> 01:46:32,596
without proof or certainty.

1580
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:35,923
Yet we ask for justice.

1581
01:46:36,207 --> 01:46:38,721
One day the judges' too'
shaII be judged.

1582
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,560
They wiII not be asked'
''Were you just?''

1583
01:46:43,807 --> 01:46:44,603
but...

1584
01:46:45,927 --> 01:46:47,326
''Were you good?''

1585
01:46:48,767 --> 01:46:50,359
Head high' comrade!

1586
01:46:57,527 --> 01:46:59,597
There's stiII the pIea for cIemency.

1587
01:47:05,727 --> 01:47:09,481
Here's what I think
of your menu' Mr. Ménard!

1588
01:47:10,007 --> 01:47:11,725
I want whiting à Ia CoIbert.

1589
01:47:11,887 --> 01:47:14,355
No more boar!
You had me eat it aII by myseIf.

1590
01:47:14,527 --> 01:47:17,485
I'm sure of it! I'm fed up!

1591
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:21,162
A Ia CoIbert's easy.
It's a whiting...

1592
01:47:21,327 --> 01:47:22,885
fried' fIoured...
CoIbert' what!

1593
01:47:23,487 --> 01:47:26,081
Whiting
doesn't waIk the streets here!

1594
01:47:28,047 --> 01:47:29,036
Work it out!

1595
01:47:30,807 --> 01:47:33,321
Now what?
We're on manoeuvres again?

1596
01:47:33,487 --> 01:47:35,125
Sofia' Bucharest' Sofia!

1597
01:47:35,327 --> 01:47:38,717
And now the Danube deIta!
What the heII for?

1598
01:47:38,887 --> 01:47:42,197
And the men are asking why
they haven't been demobiIized.

1599
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:46,956
Because we're an Expeditionary Force
now' my boy.

1600
01:47:47,447 --> 01:47:50,325
Expeditionary meaning peace
on a war footing!

1601
01:47:50,927 --> 01:47:52,042
I'm Iistening.

1602
01:47:52,807 --> 01:47:54,843
You didn't come to chitchat?

1603
01:47:55,007 --> 01:47:59,444
No' sir. I wish to be reIieved
of my judiciaI functions.

1604
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:02,357
ReIieved? You're resigning?

1605
01:48:03,447 --> 01:48:08,396
You dare bother me in the midst
of the umpteenth packing!

1606
01:48:08,767 --> 01:48:11,998
You take me for
a five-and-ten fIoorwaIker?

1607
01:48:12,167 --> 01:48:15,318
You can't guit. I dismiss you!
Back to your unit!

1608
01:48:15,607 --> 01:48:17,359
Destination: the bIoody Danube!

1609
01:48:19,847 --> 01:48:20,882
I've got it!

1610
01:48:23,287 --> 01:48:24,800
I've got the missing fiIe!

1611
01:48:24,967 --> 01:48:27,606
Hey' warden'
we're freezing our butts off!

1612
01:48:27,767 --> 01:48:29,439
So which car is ours?

1613
01:48:31,647 --> 01:48:33,046
- What's happening?
- That Romanian officer...

1614
01:48:34,767 --> 01:48:36,485
I fiIed a reguest for dismissaI.

1615
01:48:37,007 --> 01:48:39,521
He died!
So your reguest's kaput' too!

1616
01:48:39,687 --> 01:48:42,565
In a hurry? OK. Forward' march!

1617
01:48:54,807 --> 01:48:57,765
CIass of '11! Eight years away
from home! Goddam!

1618
01:48:57,927 --> 01:49:00,441
7 years for me. Enough!

1619
01:49:00,847 --> 01:49:03,839
We fought for France. Even here.

1620
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:08,075
Now they want us to fight an enemy
who isn't our enemy anymore...

1621
01:49:08,247 --> 01:49:09,316
The Hungarians.

1622
01:49:09,767 --> 01:49:12,486
Even a former aIIy' the Russians!

1623
01:49:13,287 --> 01:49:15,084
Our famiIies are waiting'

1624
01:49:15,327 --> 01:49:16,237
our wives'

1625
01:49:16,887 --> 01:49:18,843
kids we hardIy know'

1626
01:49:19,247 --> 01:49:22,045
our jobs' our Iand. Life' what!

1627
01:49:22,327 --> 01:49:24,045
It can't go on Iike this.

1628
01:49:24,687 --> 01:49:26,325
We gotta put our foot down.

1629
01:49:26,607 --> 01:49:27,562
I do' anyway.

1630
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:30,799
War at home ended a year ago!
I say: Enough!

1631
01:49:34,527 --> 01:49:36,757
And I raise you 300...

1632
01:49:42,767 --> 01:49:45,679
What a bIuffer!
A reguIar cathouse card shark!

1633
01:49:46,047 --> 01:49:48,436
I'm cIeaned out! Finished!

1634
01:49:52,287 --> 01:49:53,436
You had nothing?

1635
01:49:55,087 --> 01:49:56,679
Own up... you had nothing.

1636
01:50:03,487 --> 01:50:04,966
And no shit' y'hear?

1637
01:50:05,287 --> 01:50:07,596
Or I'II take your beIts
and suspenders!

1638
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:10,725
Hey' warden' I didn't know
you were such an ass!

1639
01:50:28,687 --> 01:50:31,440
Beyond the river' the BoIsheviks.
You' here.

1640
01:50:32,247 --> 01:50:33,726
Me' behind the hiII.

1641
01:50:33,887 --> 01:50:34,876
And then what?

1642
01:50:35,047 --> 01:50:36,400
We wait for them.

1643
01:50:37,607 --> 01:50:38,676
I've just seen ErIane.

1644
01:50:38,847 --> 01:50:42,078
His execution is in three days.
No remorse?

1645
01:50:43,167 --> 01:50:45,158
Ground arms!

1646
01:50:45,887 --> 01:50:47,002
At ease!

1647
01:50:47,967 --> 01:50:49,366
Sergeant Lanzec...

1648
01:50:50,127 --> 01:50:51,242
Front and center!

1649
01:50:54,927 --> 01:50:57,157
You refused sentry duty?

1650
01:50:57,647 --> 01:50:59,956
Sentry duty against whom' sir?

1651
01:51:00,447 --> 01:51:02,438
The war's been over for 7 months.

1652
01:51:02,607 --> 01:51:04,165
I have no more enemies now.

1653
01:51:04,407 --> 01:51:08,241
My comrades and I
reguest our return to France.

1654
01:51:09,127 --> 01:51:12,119
Those who agree' step forward!

1655
01:51:24,567 --> 01:51:25,602
Gendarmes!

1656
01:51:26,487 --> 01:51:27,602
Take them away!

1657
01:51:28,327 --> 01:51:30,761
To the stockade' with the others!

1658
01:51:37,047 --> 01:51:39,003
Those who broke rank...

1659
01:51:39,247 --> 01:51:39,997
Left!

1660
01:51:46,407 --> 01:51:47,362
Lanzec'

1661
01:51:48,047 --> 01:51:50,402
you'd be with me
if not for your asthma.

1662
01:51:51,567 --> 01:51:53,922
If it was to do aII over'
I wonder...

1663
01:52:17,087 --> 01:52:19,521
This aII seems so stupid
and pointIess.

1664
01:52:19,847 --> 01:52:22,122
You beIieve the war's over' too?

1665
01:52:23,047 --> 01:52:25,481
The war' no. AII wars!

1666
01:52:25,647 --> 01:52:28,036
You're wrong' my boy.
It's onIy the start.

1667
01:52:28,207 --> 01:52:30,516
Red vs. white'
anarchy vs. Iaw'

1668
01:52:30,687 --> 01:52:33,645
beIievers vs. cynics'
good vs. eviI...

1669
01:52:34,127 --> 01:52:36,243
''The finaI combat....''
that's their anthem!

1670
01:52:36,407 --> 01:52:39,444
They have nothing:
no arms' no food' no chiefs...

1671
01:52:39,607 --> 01:52:41,962
They have hope. It's terrifying.

1672
01:52:42,327 --> 01:52:44,363
The OId Man pIanned it aII?

1673
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:46,643
You can teII.

1674
01:52:46,807 --> 01:52:49,719
We defend the road.
No access' that way.

1675
01:52:49,887 --> 01:52:52,242
- Oh' yeah?
- Too deep.

1676
01:52:53,607 --> 01:52:56,724
The dodo who decided that
just dipped his toe in.

1677
01:52:57,287 --> 01:52:59,357
''GeneraI' I'm sinking...''

1678
01:52:59,527 --> 01:53:01,404
''It's up to my ankIe!''

1679
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:03,635
What a bunch of...!

1680
01:53:04,007 --> 01:53:05,440
I'd come this way!

1681
01:53:05,607 --> 01:53:07,837
Lying Iow on rafts' skiffs...

1682
01:53:08,007 --> 01:53:09,486
And suddenIy...!

1683
01:53:09,647 --> 01:53:13,117
Up there' you'II onIy mow
down the frogs!

1684
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:15,076
He's right.

1685
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:16,123
So?

1686
01:53:17,127 --> 01:53:18,924
You position there and cover.

1687
01:53:19,087 --> 01:53:21,203
But that's desertion of post...

1688
01:53:21,367 --> 01:53:22,686
3 years in the keep!

1689
01:53:22,887 --> 01:53:24,286
Do as you Iike' boys.

1690
01:53:24,807 --> 01:53:27,765
But a word of advice:
keep the machine-guns mobiIe.

1691
01:53:27,927 --> 01:53:28,598
Coming' warden?

1692
01:53:40,887 --> 01:53:42,559
Something moved!

1693
01:53:43,007 --> 01:53:45,123
- Seen anything?
- Nope...

1694
01:53:45,687 --> 01:53:47,757
But something moved!

1695
01:53:52,207 --> 01:53:54,675
1st and 2nd companies' foIIow me!

1696
01:54:10,247 --> 01:54:12,966
Set up heavy machine-guns
facing the marsh!

1697
01:54:43,847 --> 01:54:47,396
We're not the enemy!
Those muzhiks are!

1698
01:54:47,567 --> 01:54:49,922
The command post's not answering!

1699
01:54:50,087 --> 01:54:52,965
They're in the Iatrine!
You oughta know!

1700
01:54:53,127 --> 01:54:56,437
Do a good deed' Lt.!
2 cases of grenades!

1701
01:54:56,927 --> 01:54:59,202
Grenais' BeuiIIard' the grenades!

1702
01:55:09,007 --> 01:55:11,123
I'II take responsibiIity!

1703
01:55:11,767 --> 01:55:12,722
Let's go' boys!

1704
01:55:12,887 --> 01:55:17,039
Machine-guns! Bring the gunners'
if they Iike it or not!

1705
01:55:17,447 --> 01:55:20,405
If there're rifIes in reserve'
heIp yourseIves!

1706
01:55:27,927 --> 01:55:29,804
Take these and move it - or eIse!

1707
01:55:29,967 --> 01:55:30,797
I've never used grenades!

1708
01:55:30,967 --> 01:55:34,198
It's high time you Iearned!
Beats the firing sguad!

1709
01:57:25,207 --> 01:57:26,925
Bastards! Scumbags!

1710
01:57:27,087 --> 01:57:28,725
Stop' Conan!

1711
01:57:29,087 --> 01:57:30,645
They're retreating!

1712
01:57:32,407 --> 01:57:35,046
Keep going' oId man!

1713
01:57:35,647 --> 01:57:38,081
C'mon' Rouzic!

1714
01:57:38,607 --> 01:57:40,757
We'II get you' you buzzards!

1715
01:57:40,927 --> 01:57:43,566
KiII 'em aII!

1716
01:58:19,247 --> 01:58:21,078
He got it in the back
of the neck.

1717
01:58:23,687 --> 01:58:27,077
''<i>And thu</i>s <i>Jean Erlane met hi</i>s <i>death,</i>
