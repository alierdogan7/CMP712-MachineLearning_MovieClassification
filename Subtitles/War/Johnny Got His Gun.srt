1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,570
[drumroll]

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,081
[drumroll continues]

3
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,562
[mortar falling]

4
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,577
[deep breathing]

5
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,590
[breathing continues]

6
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:44,605
How did you get him
so quickly?

7
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,607
A medical team heard
the shell coming in.

8
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,108
Apparently, he did, too.

9
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,011
Chest and belly
practically unmarked.

10
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,381
Curious how they always
double up in the fetal position.

11
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,849
What's curious about it?

12
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,684
They're trying to
protect their genitals.

13
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,553
Well, this young man
unfortunately succeeded.

14
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,422
Any identification?

15
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:02,456
No, sir.

16
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:03,758
Then we'll assume he's ours.

17
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,694
I'll need to take personal
charge of this case

18
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:08,162
until repairs are completed.

19
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,130
That could be
rather a long time,

20
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,632
Colonel Tillery.

21
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,100
Wouldn't you say, Captain,

22
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,036
that it's worth a year
of any doctor's life

23
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,837
to observe
a case like this?

24
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:19,782
You'd never know what
has happened to him.

25
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,284
The one part of his brain
that has escaped damage

26
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,287
is the medulla oblongata.

27
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,289
It is only because of this

28
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,291
that his heart, vasal, motor,

29
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,793
and respiratory centers
still function.

30
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,796
In short, that he lives.

31
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,797
[gunshot wails]

32
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,300
[drumroll]

33
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,307
[explosion in distance]

34
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,862
Unidentified casualty
number 4-7.

35
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,864
Post-operation orders,

36
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,865
Colonel M.F. Tillery,

37
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,367
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

38
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,870
Although the cerebellum
still permits

39
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,371
limited physical movement,

40
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,874
said movement
signifies nothing.

41
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,376
Bodily actions
have become violent,

42
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,878
and are persistently
repetitive

43
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,382
and must be treated as
reflexive muscular spasms--

44
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,884
which is to say, by sedation.

45
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:08,758
The cerebrum has suffered
massive and irreparable damage.

46
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,259
Had I not been sure of this,

47
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,262
I would not have
permitted him to live.

48
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:20,778
There's no justification
for his continued existence

49
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,747
unless we learn from him
how to help others.

50
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:25,750
Care for him as gently

51
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,751
as if he knew
what you were doing

52
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:30,755
and would feel the pain
if you did it badly.

53
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,257
Attending personnel
will remember that

54
00:05:33,257 --> 00:05:34,691
good medical care forbids

55
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,461
emotional involvement
with the patient.

56
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,363
Avoid such involvement
by remembering

57
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,375
that it is impossible for
a decerebrated individual

58
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,878
to experience pain,
pleasure, memory,

59
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,323
dreams, or thought
of any kind.

60
00:05:50,323 --> 00:05:53,326
It follows, therefore,
that this young man

61
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:56,829
will be as unfeeling,
as unthinking as the dead

62
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,332
until the day he joins them.

63
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:01,734
[pendulum ticks]

64
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:13,079
[ticking continues]

65
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,087
[Joe]
Kareen?

66
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:29,095
Kareen?

67
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,601
What happened?

68
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,614
Where am I?

69
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,122
It's dark in here.

70
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,126
Shouldn't have
turned the lights out.

71
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,136
Your old man
will be sore.

72
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:54,971
Oh, Mike won't care.
He loves me.

73
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:58,574
Only could I just
ask you one thing?

74
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:01,052
Why'd you have to volunteer?

75
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:03,454
Only six months
from the draft anyhow.

76
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,965
Pinkie and Larry
have already gone.

77
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,467
You could have been exempt
because of your sisters.

78
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:09,969
My mother's got a job.

79
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,347
Besides, when the country
needs you, you've gotta go.

80
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,259
You should go.

81
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,794
I don't think
anybody should go.

82
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,696
They'll kill you.

83
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:19,699
Oh, I could get killed
at the bakery, too,

84
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,701
or crossing the street.

85
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:24,704
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry.

86
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,640
Lots of people get killed
who don't think they'll be.

87
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,541
Lots of people come
back, too. Most of 'em.

88
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:33,279
Most of them, Joe,
they never come back.

89
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,114
Oh, if anything ever
happened to you,

90
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,523
I'd just die.

91
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:39,326
Ah, you're only
saying that.

92
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,262
I love you.

93
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,231
I do love you.

94
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,166
[dog barks]

95
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,635
[door closes]

96
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,071
[footsteps]

97
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:53,974
[record scratch]

98
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:56,952
Stop it.

99
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,938
I won't have this
in my house.

100
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,807
You think you're sitting in
the back seat of a flivver?

101
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,051
Now get up. Both of you,
get up like decent people.

102
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,528
Come on, get up.

103
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,030
But he's going away
in the morning.

104
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,533
I know, I know.
Get in the bedroom.

105
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,035
Both of you.

106
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,376
I ain't much.

107
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,378
25 years
in the coal mines,

108
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,880
carryin' an IWW card.

109
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,214
Now, what am I?

110
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,183
Goddamn railroad
bull, that's what.

111
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,118
Oh, anyhow.

112
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,087
Go on in there
with her. She's scared.

113
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,996
Go-- Go on in.

114
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:35,798
Yes, sir.
Put your arms around her.

115
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,809
You know how to
treat her, don't you? Yes, sir.

116
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,243
Uh--

117
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:41,212
She isn't a whore.
You know that, don't ya?

118
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,714
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:45,149
Eh, go to bed, son.

120
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,684
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,560
Son.

122
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:03,342
I see you.

123
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,354
Nice room.

124
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:13,127
Mike fixed it up
for my graduation.

125
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,965
Picture's crooked, though.

126
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,640
It was my mother's.

127
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,547
Why don't you
take your shoes off?

128
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:34,982
Okay.

129
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,227
[clears throat]

130
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:21,730
Joe.

131
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,164
Yeah?

132
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,665
Could you turn your back?

133
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,167
Why?

134
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,568
I have to get out of bed.

135
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,355
No. I want to see you.

136
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,856
I won't let you see me.

137
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,757
Would you get me my robe?

138
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,592
Sure.

139
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,528
It's on the closet
door. It's red.

140
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,697
Okay.

141
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,548
Why'd you do that?

142
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,483
Hot night.

143
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,395
Here it is.

144
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:55,700
[laughs] Bring it
closer, silly. Uh-uh. Reach for it.

145
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,702
All right, here.
I'll help you.

146
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:06,678
[Joe]
Oops.

147
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,983
Let's get it
through here.

148
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,919
There. There you go.

149
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,421
[laughing]

150
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,357
I'll get it right.

151
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:20,358
Here, let me show you.

152
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:23,361
[giggling]
Now we got it. There.

153
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,798
Huh?
No.

154
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:43,948
[sighing]

155
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:57,295
We should have flowers.
Hm? Sure.

156
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,001
[nervous chuckle]

157
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,905
If you really
want to see me--

158
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:08,406
Oh, if you don't
want me to,

159
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:09,907
I don't want to, either.

160
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,582
[train whistle blows]

161
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,586
Well, fair is fair.

162
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:04,429
Okay.

163
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:08,225
[toilet flushes]

164
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,536
[Mike coughs]

165
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,040
[crickets chirp]

166
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:29,046
[chimes jingle]

167
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,484
It's nice like this,
isn't it?

168
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:36,321
Mm-hmm.

169
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,823
Have you ever been this
way with anyone else?

170
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:40,825
Not with anyone I loved.

171
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:42,802
I'm glad.

172
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:44,812
Have you?

173
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,314
You shouldn't
ask that.

174
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,790
[laughs]
Why not?

175
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,258
Because I'm a lady.

176
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,078
[chuckles]
You're a mick.

177
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,546
No, I've never
been this way

178
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:55,515
with anyone
else before.

179
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:58,017
I know.
But you couldn't have known.

180
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:59,519
Not really.

181
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,322
Joe, I don't
want you to go.

182
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:06,301
I want you
to run away.

183
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,737
You don't want me
to see Paris, France,

184

My salary is also small.

531
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,481
Son is small.
So is my wife,

532
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,851
and get right down to it,
I'm no giant, myself.

533
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:41,820
Everything
around me is small,

534
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,289
inferior,

535
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,692
except this fishing pole.

536
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:51,129
I, myself,
wind it every year

537
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,931
with the best
of silk thread.

538
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:54,841
See this lacquer?

539
00:35:55,275 --> 00:35:57,653
Comes from China.

540
00:35:57,653 --> 00:35:59,588
No finer lacquer
in the world.

541
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:05,995
See those guides?

542
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:07,429
Pure amber.

543
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,308
Nobody in town has
a fishing pole like this.

544
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:14,311
Not even Mr. Ladamer
down at the bank.

545
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,782
My life is so poor
and shoddy

546
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:20,184
that without this pole,
why,

547
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:23,554
I'd have nothing to set me
apart from other men.

548
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:27,090
Nothing to give me distinction,
nothing at all.

549
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:31,428
That's why
I love it so much.

550
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,898
Do you love it more
than you love me?

551
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:35,866
[laughs] 'Course I do.

552
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:39,136
What is there about you
that can give a man distinction?

553
00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:41,038
You're not unusual at all.

554
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:42,973
Yes I am, Father.

555
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,675
How's that?

556
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:46,878
I may not be
unusual now,

557
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:49,046
but I'm going to be.

558
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,349
Of course you are.

559
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,751
You're gonna make the world
safe for democracy, aren't ya?

560
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:55,586
What is democracy?

561
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,391
Well, I was never very
clear on it, myself.

562
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:05,862
Like every other
kind of government,

563
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:08,165
it's got something to do
with young men

564
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,567
killing each other,
I believe.

565
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:12,911
Why don't old men
kill each other?

566
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:14,279
Well, the old men
are needed

567
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,215
to keep the home
fires burning.

568
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:19,102
Couldn't the young men
do that just as well?

569
00:37:19,102 --> 00:37:21,337
Young men don't have homes.

570
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:23,206
That's why they must go out
and kill each other.

571
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,744
When it comes my turn,

572
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:29,145
will you want me to go?

573
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,958
For democracy,

574
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:35,827
any man would give
his only begotten son.

575
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,005
I wouldn't.

576
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:48,691
I won't be here
to stop you, Joe.

577
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,198
Put your arms around me.

578
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:58,867
I need their warmth

579
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:01,604
to keep the chill
of death away.

580
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:04,272
I can't.

581
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,485
Please?

582
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:10,987
No!

583
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:20,563
Well...

584
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:21,598
I guess it always
comes down to that.

585
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,603
Each man faces
death by himself.

586
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:29,439
Alone.

587
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:30,840
From now on, it's
a simple matter

588
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,142
of good nursing care,

589
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,320
I can always be
reached at GHQ

590
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,754
if anything develops.

591
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:39,090
Let's try the mask.

592
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,591
<i>Thank God. They're</i>
<i>finally getting</i>

593
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:42,560
<i>this stuff off my face.</i>

594
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:43,495
<i>The air feels good.</i>

595
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:45,496
<i>Feels cool.</i>

596
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:50,776
Repairs seem to
have healed well.

597
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,282
<i>What's this?</i>

598
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:56,783
You see?

599
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:58,284
Works very well.

600
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,786
Any questions?

601
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,622
Good luck.

602
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:04,123
<i>It's better.</i>

603
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:05,625
<i>It does let</i>
<i>the air in.</i>

604
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,627
<i>But I thought when</i>
<i>they unbandaged my face,</i>

605
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:09,595
<i>I'd be all healed.</i>

606
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:27,146
<i>She's cleaning</i>
<i>my breathing tube.</i>

607
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,047
[hose slurping]

608
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:30,391
<i>I thought when they took</i>
<i>this stuff off my face,</i>

609
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:33,061
<i>they'd take</i>
<i>the tubes out, too.</i>

610
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:35,964
<i>But they didn't.</i>

611
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:37,432
<i>I don't understand.</i>

612
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,411
<i>Where is she going now?</i>

613
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,291
<i>Oh, yes. I know.</i>

614
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:59,604
<i>I've still got</i>
<i>my feeding tube.</i>

615
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:03,809
<i>When am I gonna</i>
<i>be able to feed myself?</i>

616
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,278
<i>When am I going to get well?</i>

617
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:13,852
<i>Dinner's over.</i>

618
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:16,655
<i>But it won't always</i>
<i>be like this, will it?</i>

619
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:18,957
<i>Now wait.</i>

620
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:21,860
<i>Think for a minute.</i>

621
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:22,862
<i>There's something</i>
<i>funny here--</i>

622
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:24,797
<i>something cool,</i>
<i>something wet.</i>

623
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,799
<i>I thought my face</i>
<i>was just wrapped up,</i>

624
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,767
<i>when they unwrapped it,</i>
<i>I could--</i>

625
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:32,070
<i>Oh. Oh, please, I--</i>

626
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,972
<i>Now, get a hold</i>
<i>of yourself, Joe.</i>

627
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,941
<i>Don't lose your head.</i>

628
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:37,342
<i>Your jaws.</i>

629
00:40:37,343 --> 00:40:38,844
<i>You can't move your jaws.</i>

630
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:43,849
<i>They don't work.</i>

631
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:45,358
<i>You haven't got any.</i>

632
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,260
<i>Well, take your tongue, rub</i>
<i>it around inside your teeth</i>

633
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,262
<i>like you were chasing</i>
<i>a raspberry seed.</i>

634
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:53,166
<i>I-- I haven't got any tongue!</i>

635
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:55,902
<i>I-- I haven't got</i>
<i>any teeth for it to feel.</i>

636
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,905
<i>I haven't got anything</i>
<i>here but a hole.</i>

637
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:00,240
<i>How big is it?</i>

638
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,742
<i>How-- How does it go?</i>

639
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:05,754
<i>Now don't panic.</i>

640
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,256
<i>Think.</i>

641
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:11,767
<i>Inside of the hole is--</i>
<i>is wet.</i>

642
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,670
<i>The edges of it are dry.</i>

643
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:16,114
<i>Wet, dry.</i>

644
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:17,850
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

645
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,693
<i>Now, figure out</i>
<i>where it's dry.</i>

646
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,670
<i>Feel. Yes.</i>

647
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,547
<i>I'm feeling.</i>

648
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:27,285
<i>Dry-- And shouldn't</i>
<i>the hole go up?</i>

649
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,753
<i>[nervously] Up.</i>

650
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,021
<i>No eyes.</i>

651
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,490
<i>I haven't got any eyes</i>

652
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,924
<i>or mouth or teeth,</i>
<i>tongue, or nose.</i>

653
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:34,934
<i>I haven't gotten anything,</i>

654
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:36,902
<i>but my whole face</i>
<i>is scooped out!</i>

655
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:39,772
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>it's me, and I'm alive!</i>

656
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:41,182
<i>Oh, no. It can't be!</i>

657
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:44,585
<i>Not me! I--</i>
<i>I can't live like this!</i>

658
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,087
<i>I-- I can't.</i>

659
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,488
<i>Please, no, I can't--</i>
<i>I can't!</i>

660
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:48,965
<i>Help me. Somebody</i>
<i>please help me.</i>

661
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,400
<i>Mother, where are ya?</i>

662
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:52,902
<i>Help me, Mother.</i>
<i>I'm having a nightmare</i>

663
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:54,803
<i>and I can't wake up.</i>

664
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:58,274
<i>If you don't wake me up</i>
<i>I'll be like this for years</i>

665
00:41:58,274 --> 00:41:59,208
<i>and years</i>

666
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,076
<i>and years</i>

667
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:11,620
<i>Pray for me, please.</i>

668
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:14,123
<i>Please, pray for me.</i>

669
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:17,626
To all those
in the armed forces

670
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:21,631
who sacrificed
their young lives

671
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:25,134
in this just and holy war

672
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:28,137
for everlasting peace,

673
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:33,642
I grant absolution
of all their sins.

674
00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:35,144
In the name of the Father

675
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:36,645
and of the Son

676
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,648
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.

677
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:41,651
Let us pray.

678
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:51,435
<i>A place like this,</i>
<i>you've gotta think</i>

679
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:54,939
<i>in order to keep</i>
<i>from thinking.</i>

680
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,440
<i>There are eight planets,</i>

681
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:59,844
<i>Earth, Venus,</i>

682
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,146
<i>Mars, Jupiter,</i>

683
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,451
<i>Mercury--</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

684
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,886
<i>There's something</i>
<i>chewing on my forehead.</i>

685
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,264
<i>It's a rat!</i>

686
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:13,766
<i>It's one of those great</i>
<i>big fat trench rats.</i>

687
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:17,144
<i>Help me, somebody.</i>
<i>Kill it!</i>

688
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:19,589
<i>No, couldn't be a rat.</i>

689
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,490
<i>They wouldn't let</i>
<i>rats run around</i>

690
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:23,392
<i>chewing up the customers</i>
<i>in a place like this.</i>

691
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:25,428
<i>It's a dream.</i>

692
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,897
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

693
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>It is a rat.</i>

694
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,868
<i>It's crawling.</i>
<i>It's crawling.</i>

695
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,803
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

696
00:43:33,803 --> 00:43:36,572
<i>Don't--</i>
<i>Don't let it get me.</i>

697
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,309
<i>No. No, no. No, no, no.</i>

698
00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:42,654
<i>He's close.</i>

699
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,622
<i>He's on my chest.</i>

700
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,059
<i>Don't even scare him.</i>

701
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:50,882
<i>Hold still and he will--</i>

702
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:53,484
<i>[screams]</i>

703
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:54,953
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

704
00:43:54,953 --> 00:43:56,354
<i>Did somebody kill it?</i>

705
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:58,122
<i>Or did it just go away?</i>

706
00:43:58,398 --> 00:44:01,343
<i>What if it comes back?</i>

707
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:02,777
<i>It was a dream.</i>

708
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:05,147
<i>It had to be.</i>

709
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:06,648
<i>But how can you tell</i>

710
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:08,158
<i>what's a dream</i>
<i>and what's real</i>

711
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,094
<i>when you can't even</i>
<i>tell when you're awake</i>

712
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:11,595
<i>and when you're asleep?</i>

713
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,364
<i>Or maybe the rat's real</i>

714
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:15,833
<i>and the nurse here</i>
<i>is a dream.</i>

715
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,504
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>how can I ever be able</i> <i>to tell the difference?</i>

716
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:23,440
The thing to do is yell.

717
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,409
Sometimes, even now,
I have this old dream

718
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:28,412
that somebody
wants to kill me.

719
00:44:28,412 --> 00:44:29,921
And my mother and father
are running away

720
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,756
with me to Egypt.

721
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,759
I hear the sound of
soldiers riding at night

722
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:35,560
and the screams.

723
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,861
And I yell.

724
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:38,905
And the yell wakes me up.

725
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:41,315
And then I know
that it's a dream.

726
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:43,251
So what you have
to do is yell.

727
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:45,253
But, you see,
I can't yell.

728
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:47,755
I can't even whisper.

729
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:50,758
Well, whispering
wouldn't help anyhow.

730
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:54,762
Another way is just
to tell yourself

731
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:59,233
"Wait a minute, here.
This is a nightmare.

732
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:01,669
"And I have to wake up
in order to stop it."

733
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:02,670
Then just force
your eyes open,

734
00:45:03,104 --> 00:45:04,655
and the dream
will be gone.

735
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:06,990
Oh, I can't open my eyes.
I haven't got any.

736
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,097
Well, that complicates things.

737
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,534
Maybe the thing to do

738
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:20,471
is police your mind
before you go to sleep.

739
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:22,473
Say to yourself,

740
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:24,908
"I'm going to sleep now.

741
00:45:24,909 --> 00:45:28,212
"And I'm not going
to have any nightmares."

742
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,547
Could be done, you know?
With practice.

743
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:35,694
You feel yourself
getting drowsy--

744
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,562
I never feel drowsy.

745
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:39,398
I haven't got anything
to feel drowsy with.

746
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:43,969
Nothing?
[footsteps]

747
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,341
Maybe we should

748
00:46:22,341 --> 00:46:23,809
take a different
line of attack,

749
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,243
altogether.

750
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:28,113
Let us begin
by assuming

751
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:29,455
that everything
is a dream,

752
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,800
which by and large,
it is.

753
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,201
When we're awake,
we have one kind of dream.

754
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,644
When we're asleep,
we have another.

755
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:36,646
The difference is

756
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:38,649
that we control
our daydreams.

757
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:40,584
And the dream
that comes at night

758
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:43,086
controls us.

759
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:45,588
Now think about that.

760
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:49,100
When you dream that
the rat is there,

761
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,602
do you control the dream?

762
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,071
Or does the dream
control you?

763
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,480
It controls me.

764
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:56,866
Yes, exactly.

765
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,368
If the rat
were really there,

766
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:00,303
you'd knock it off,
wouldn't you?

767
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:01,704
Of course.

768
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:03,623
So the fact that
you don't knock it off

769
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:06,166
proves that
it really is a dream.

770
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,469
Yes, yes.

771
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,972
I-- [sighs]

772
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,307
That doesn't work.

773
00:47:13,808 --> 00:47:16,143
Even if the rat was real,
I couldn't knock it off

774
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:17,478
because I haven't
got any arms.

775
00:47:20,715 --> 00:47:21,682
No arms.

776
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:23,685
I haven't got anything.

777
00:47:23,685 --> 00:47:25,586
I'm just like a piece of meat

778
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,555
that keeps on living.

779
00:47:32,902 --> 00:47:35,838
Since your real life--
[sighs]

780
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,074
is a greater nightmare
than your dreams,

781
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,976
it would be cruel

782
00:47:40,977 --> 00:47:44,480
to pretend that anyone
could help you.

783
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:48,425
What you need is a miracle.

784
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:49,911
No, not a miracle.

785
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:51,929
Just tell me
that the rat is real.

786
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,933
And the way I am now
is a dream.

787
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:56,410
Perhaps it would be
better for you

788
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,911
to go away now.

789
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:59,412
You're a very
unlucky young man,

790
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,922
and sometimes
it rubs off.

791
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:03,425
I'll go, but first
tell me just one thing.

792
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,927
Are you and I
really here together?

793
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:07,962
Or is this
a dream, too?

794
00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:09,473
It's a dream.
How do you know?

795
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:12,484
Because I'm a dream.
I don't believe you.

796
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:15,454
Nobody does.
[chuckles]

797
00:48:15,455 --> 00:48:17,865
That's why I'm as unreal

798
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:20,734
as every other dream
that didn't come true.

799
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,407
<i>I don't know whether</i>
<i>I'm alive and dreaming</i>

800
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:29,368
<i>or dead and remembering.</i>

801
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:31,286
<i>Am I getting old?</i>

802
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:32,788
<i>Is my hair turning gray?</i>

803
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:35,291
<i>Will anybody ever</i>
<i>come to visit me?</i>

804
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:37,126
<i>I hope not.</i>

805
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:38,560
<i>I really wouldn't</i>
<i>want anybody</i>

806
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:40,896
<i>to see me like this.</i>

807
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:43,774
<i>I do get homesick, though.</i>

808
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,285
<i>Oh, but they wouldn't</i>
<i>have shipped me that</i> <i>long way home.</i>

809
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:48,797
<i>Not with all these</i>
<i>tubes and things in me.</i>

810
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:51,799
<i>No, I'm probably in</i>
<i>some frog hospital,</i>

811
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,802
<i>or maybe limey.</i>

812
00:48:53,802 --> 00:48:56,304
<i>At least my teeth</i>
<i>don't ache.</i>

813
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:57,238
[door opens]

814
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,716
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>What's this?</i>

815
00:48:59,717 --> 00:49:01,218
<i>There are two</i>
<i>vibrations,</i>

816
00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:02,686
<i>and one of them</i>
<i>is heavy.</i>

817
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:04,187
<i>It's a man.</i>

818
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,098
Why are the shutters
closed?

819
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:08,108
They always have been.

820
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:10,543
At least, as long
as I've been here.

821
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:12,554
It's on the order sheet.

822
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:13,997
Well, it's crazy.

823
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:16,507
<i>Well,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

824
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:18,510
<i>Hello? Have I</i>
<i>got visitors?</i>

825
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,011
<i>What happened then?</i>

826
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:21,512
As long as I'm
head nurse of this ward,

827
00:49:21,513 --> 00:49:24,349
the shutters are open
and they will stay open.

828
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:26,158
Let him have
a little sunshine.

829
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:27,593
They said it was
to keep people

830
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:28,560
from peeking
in at him.

831
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:31,573
It would take a man
7 feet tall

832
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:33,575
to peek through that window.

833
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:35,076
Oh, and another thing.

834
00:49:35,577 --> 00:49:36,578
I want sheets
on this bed.

835
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,290
<i>He's walking.</i>
No more blankets.

836
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,267
He can't really
tell the difference, you know.

837
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:43,168
<i>Now he's stopped.</i>
I can.

838
00:49:47,073 --> 00:49:49,442
[sighs] Well.

839
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:53,345
How did the triage officer
ever overlook this one?

840
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,696
<i>He's looking at me.</i>

841
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,569
Poor baby.

842
00:50:05,942 --> 00:50:07,451
<i>No, it's a woman.</i>

843
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:08,885
<i>Those hands, a fat woman.</i>

844
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:10,787
<i>That's why I could feel</i>
<i>her footsteps so plain.</i>

845
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:13,657
Poor-- Poor baby.

846
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:18,896
Come on.

847
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,448
<i>That was funny.</i>

848
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:31,383
<i>What were they doing?</i>
<i>What has happened?</i>

849
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:32,860
<i>What's different?</i>

850
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:34,803
<i>Think, Joe.</i>

851
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:35,805
<i>Think. Use your head.</i>

852
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,740
<i>Feel.</i>
<i>Feel with your scalp</i>

853
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,208
<i>and the skin</i>
<i>on your forehead.</i>

854
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,642
<i>Something has changed.</i>

855
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:43,588
<i>It was cooler before</i>
<i>she came in than it is now.</i>

856
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:46,023
<i>What I feel is--</i>
<i>is warmth.</i>

857
00:50:46,424 --> 00:50:47,758
<i>But where does it come from?</i>

858
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:50,661
<i>Yes. Yes, yes, yes.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

859
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:52,664
<i>Oh, my God. I see it now.</i>

860
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:55,133
It-- It's the sun.

861
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,135
<i>The sun, the sun, the sun.</i>

862
00:50:57,135 --> 00:51:00,346
<i>I found the sun.</i>

863
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:03,183
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

864
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,720
Thank you. Thank you.

865
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,736
If I never have
anything else,

866
00:51:14,736 --> 00:51:17,739
I'll always have God

867
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:20,241
and the morning sunlight.

868
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:29,296
<i>It's night.</i>

869
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:30,642
<i>If a man can</i>
<i>tell the difference</i>

870
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:31,442
<i>between day and night,</i>

871
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:32,877
<i>he's beginning to tell time.</i>

872
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:34,812
<i>It's warm again.</i>
<i>It's morning,</i>

873
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:36,714
<i>and she's changing</i>
<i>my sheets.</i>

874
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:38,482
<i>Now it's night.</i>

875
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:40,701
<i>Morning again.</i>
<i>She's bathing me.</i>

876
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:42,169
<i>One morning she changes me,</i>

877
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,013
<i>the next morning,</i>
<i>she bathes me.</i>

878
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:45,415
<i>Night, night.</i>

879
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,016

more than that.

on our biscuits.

1405
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:35,680
[chuckles]

1406
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,149
I could, uh, hoe
a pretty good row...

1407
01:24:39,484 --> 01:24:40,918
lay out
a pretty good grade

1408
01:24:40,919 --> 01:24:43,421
on an uphill road.
Build a house.

1409
01:24:45,432 --> 01:24:48,401
But I never did learn
how to make any money.

1410
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:51,771
The goddamndest thing
I ever ran into.

1411
01:24:53,273 --> 01:24:54,707
[sigh] See, the trouble
with life is

1412
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:56,208
you work so much,
you don't enjoy it.

1413
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:57,710
Yeah.

1414
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:58,711
Yeah.

1415
01:25:02,182 --> 01:25:03,216
Better this way.

1416
01:25:05,218 --> 01:25:05,718
Except...

1417
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:08,729
I do miss your mother.

1418
01:25:13,178 --> 01:25:14,179
How is she?

1419
01:25:14,179 --> 01:25:16,147
I haven't seen her lately.

1420
01:25:16,148 --> 01:25:17,149
Oh.

1421
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,151
Well...

1422
01:25:22,488 --> 01:25:24,423
not too long
till sunrise.

1423
01:25:24,423 --> 01:25:25,924
Mmhh.

1424
01:25:25,924 --> 01:25:27,358
I have to go.

1425
01:25:29,361 --> 01:25:30,762
Trout'll be rising.

1426
01:25:30,762 --> 01:25:32,563
Willow Lake.

1427
01:25:32,564 --> 01:25:34,465
Now that I got
my pole back, I don't want to miss 'em.

1428
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:39,404
Goodbye, Father.

1429
01:25:41,907 --> 01:25:43,884
Give my love
to your mother when you see her.

1430
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,729
Sorry I had to leave
you in the lurch,

1431
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:49,264
but it was
the only way, believe me.

1432
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:51,600
Goodbye.

1433
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,865
[Girl]
Joe. [giggles]

1434
01:26:23,866 --> 01:26:25,801
Joe.
[giggling]

1435
01:26:25,801 --> 01:26:28,036
Here I am.
[giggles]

1436
01:26:28,037 --> 01:26:29,938
No, Joe.
Over here.

1437
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:30,940
[giggling]

1438
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,442
Let's play
blindman's bluff.

1439
01:26:33,442 --> 01:26:34,443
[giggling]

1440
01:26:34,443 --> 01:26:35,444
Joe.

1441
01:26:38,881 --> 01:26:40,390
[giggling]

1442
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:42,291
Find me, Joe.

1443
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:44,702
Why did you
leave me, Joe?

1444
01:26:45,704 --> 01:26:46,680
Run, Joe.

1445
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:49,417
Why didn't you
write me?

1446
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:50,718
I couldn't
write you!

1447
01:26:50,718 --> 01:26:52,219
I just couldn't!

1448
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,067
[giggling]

1449
01:26:54,067 --> 01:26:55,034
Why couldn't you?

1450
01:26:55,034 --> 01:26:56,468
I can't tell you!

1451
01:26:56,469 --> 01:26:57,970
That's all!
I can't!

1452
01:26:57,971 --> 01:27:00,807
You don't
love me, Joe.

1453
01:27:00,807 --> 01:27:01,707
[giggles]

1454
01:27:03,109 --> 01:27:05,611
[giggling]

1455
01:27:05,612 --> 01:27:09,048
You don't love me.

1456
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:10,549
I do love you!

1457
01:27:10,962 --> 01:27:11,469
[giggling]

1458
01:27:11,904 --> 01:27:12,943
I do love you!

1459
01:27:12,944 --> 01:27:14,912
No, you don't, Joe.
You never did.

1460
01:27:14,912 --> 01:27:16,914
Don't go, Kareen!

1461
01:27:16,914 --> 01:27:18,423
[giggling]

1462
01:27:18,424 --> 01:27:19,825
Where are you?

1463
01:27:19,825 --> 01:27:21,860
Olly olly
oxen free!

1464
01:27:23,229 --> 01:27:24,697
Don't go away
from me again.

1465
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:26,699
[giggling]

1466
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,701
[giggling]

1467
01:27:29,101 --> 01:27:31,044
[begins weeping]

1468
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:32,512
Please.

1469
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,447
[Kareen weeping]

1470
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:34,448
[tearfully]
Don't.

1471
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:38,451
[sighs]

1472
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:40,888
You need help, son.

1473
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,394
There isn't any help.

1474
01:27:47,394 --> 01:27:50,397
Have you asked for any?

1475
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:51,898
I can't.

1476
01:27:55,402 --> 01:27:57,404
I can't ask for anything.

1477
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:01,408
There is no way
I can talk to them.

1478
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:04,911
Then why don't you
send a telegram?

1479
01:28:16,264 --> 01:28:18,774
A telegram?

1480
01:28:18,775 --> 01:28:21,253
Don't you remember
when you were little?

1481
01:28:21,253 --> 01:28:23,255
How you and Bill Harper
used to

1482
01:28:23,255 --> 01:28:25,257
string a wire
between the two houses

1483
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:27,626
so you could telegraph
to each other?

1484
01:28:29,161 --> 01:28:30,962
Yes.

1485
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:39,104
Still remember
the Morse code?

1486
01:28:40,539 --> 01:28:42,040
Yes.

1487
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:47,980
What good is that?

1488
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:50,449
How can I type out
a message to them?

1489
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:52,918
You've got to learn to think.

1490
01:28:52,918 --> 01:28:54,920
Use your head.

1491
01:28:56,889 --> 01:28:59,224
Yes.

1492
01:28:59,225 --> 01:29:02,161
Yes. My head.

1493
01:29:04,096 --> 01:29:06,398
My head. My head, my head!
[chuckling]

1494
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:08,600
Yes.

1495
01:29:09,902 --> 01:29:13,405
<i>Yes. My head.</i>

1496
01:29:13,405 --> 01:29:15,407
<i>My head.</i>

1497
01:29:38,697 --> 01:29:40,699
<i>Where is she going?</i>

1498
01:29:40,699 --> 01:29:42,200
[door opens]

1499
01:29:42,468 --> 01:29:45,504
Captain?
Yes?

1500
01:29:45,504 --> 01:29:47,506
Could you come here
a minute, please?

1501
01:29:47,506 --> 01:29:50,976
Yes, of course. Would you
take care of that, nurse? Thank you.

1502
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:52,978
<i>She's brought somebody in!</i>

1503
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,922
I can't understand
what he's doing.

1504
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:05,858
May I see
the orders, please?

1505
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:07,359
Yes.

1506
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:11,363
Thank you.

1507
01:30:11,363 --> 01:30:13,698
Probably an early entry.

1508
01:30:17,136 --> 01:30:18,570
"If bodily action
becomes violent

1509
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:20,906
or persistently repetitive"--

1510
01:30:20,906 --> 01:30:23,884
These movements
are persistently repetitive.

1511
01:30:23,884 --> 01:30:26,394
"They must be treated
as reflexive muscular spasms."

1512
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:28,897
Which is to say by sedation.

1513
01:30:29,398 --> 01:30:31,400
Fair enough.
I'll prepare an injection.

1514
01:30:33,402 --> 01:30:35,312
<i>Why is she trying to stop me?</i>

1515
01:30:35,813 --> 01:30:38,816
I don't believe that
the movement is reflexive.

1516
01:30:40,217 --> 01:30:42,185
Oh, you don't?

1517
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:45,055
Well, General Tillery
will pass through on the 23rd

1518
01:30:45,055 --> 01:30:47,957
with his annual
staff inspection.

1519
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:49,392
If you don't trust me,
nurse,

1520
01:30:49,393 --> 01:30:51,395
perhaps you'd better
take it up with him.

1521
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:56,408
I will.

1522
01:30:56,408 --> 01:30:58,918
Well, that's excellent,
nurse.

1523
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:01,930
General Tillery is
the chief operating surgeon

1524
01:31:01,931 --> 01:31:03,933
who wrote those orders.

1525
01:31:05,368 --> 01:31:06,869
<i>No. No.</i>

1526
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:09,372
<i>Don't give me dope.</i>

1527
01:31:09,372 --> 01:31:12,358
<i>Don't put me under again.</i>
Would you unlock the door, please?

1528
01:31:12,358 --> 01:31:15,361
<i>I'm trying to talk to you.</i>

1529
01:31:15,861 --> 01:31:19,364
<i>Oh, God, please</i>
<i>make them hear me.</i>

1530
01:31:19,365 --> 01:31:22,735
<i>All I'm asking is for you</i>
<i>to take one little idea</i>

1531
01:31:22,735 --> 01:31:26,150
<i>that's in my mind</i>
<i>and put it into their minds.</i>

1532
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:29,153
<i>Maybe only 2 or 3</i>
<i>feet away from me.</i>

1533
01:31:29,153 --> 01:31:32,956
<i>It's-- It's such</i>
<i>a little thing to ask,</i>

1534
01:31:32,957 --> 01:31:34,959
<i>but they won't listen.</i>

1535
01:31:34,959 --> 01:31:36,961
<i>They won't hear me.</i>

1536
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:39,939
<i>All they do is give me dope,</i>

1537
01:31:39,939 --> 01:31:42,274
<i>and I go down</i>

1538
01:31:42,275 --> 01:31:44,777
<i>and down</i>

1539
01:31:44,778 --> 01:31:46,279
<i>and...</i>

1540
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,281
<i>Oh, there you are, brothers.</i>

1541
01:31:49,716 --> 01:31:52,719
<i>What were you hunting</i>
<i>when they caught you?</i>

1542
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,730
<i>Look, Father!</i>
<i>I found your fishing pole!</i>

1543
01:31:57,699 --> 01:32:00,368
<i>[Father]</i>
<i>Use your head, son.</i>

1544
01:32:00,368 --> 01:32:03,204
<i>I am, Father. I am.</i>

1545
01:32:04,472 --> 01:32:06,941
<i>Hear me.</i>

1546
01:32:06,941 --> 01:32:11,312
<i>Please try to understand</i>
<i>what I'm doing and hear me!</i>

1547
01:32:13,715 --> 01:32:17,985
<i>[Morse code machine clicking]</i>

1548
01:32:23,324 --> 01:32:25,326
<i>She did hear me!</i>

1549
01:32:25,326 --> 01:32:27,227
<i>She's going</i>
<i>to get somebody!</i>

1550
01:32:27,228 --> 01:32:29,630
<i>[clicking intensifies]</i>

1551
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:31,833
<i>She didn't even</i>
<i>close the door!</i>

1552
01:32:39,774 --> 01:32:42,143
<i>I've broken through.</i>

1553
01:32:42,143 --> 01:32:45,146
<i>I'm back</i>
<i>with people again.</i>

1554
01:32:45,146 --> 01:32:48,157
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>all you people out there.</i>

1555
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:52,137
<i>It's me, and we're going</i>
<i>to talk to each other.</i>

1556
01:32:52,137 --> 01:32:54,639
<i>They're here. A lot of them.</i>

1557
01:33:01,413 --> 01:33:02,814
It's Morse code.

1558
01:33:02,815 --> 01:33:04,550
For what?

1559
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:08,161
SOS. Help.

1560
01:33:12,065 --> 01:33:14,934
Do you mean to say
that this man

1561
01:33:14,935 --> 01:33:18,271
is actually speaking to us?

1562
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:20,615
<i>What are they doing?</i>

1563
01:33:20,616 --> 01:33:22,050
Yes, sir.

1564
01:33:30,759 --> 01:33:32,694
Decerebrated, General?

1565
01:33:33,662 --> 01:33:36,598
Completely decerebrated?

1566
01:33:36,598 --> 01:33:38,533
<i>What are they waiting for?</i>

1567
01:33:38,767 --> 01:33:39,768
<i>What's happening?</i>

1568
01:33:49,111 --> 01:33:51,613
<i>Are they leaving?</i>

1569
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:53,114
<i>No.</i>

1570
01:33:53,115 --> 01:33:55,617
<i>Just one of them.</i>

1571
01:33:55,617 --> 01:33:57,561
<i>Or maybe two.</i>

1572
01:33:57,562 --> 01:33:59,071
<i>No. Just one.</i>

1573
01:34:04,943 --> 01:34:06,786
Ask what he wants.

1574
01:34:06,786 --> 01:34:09,622
How can I ask a man like this
a question like that?

1575
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:13,525
By asking it.
How else can we help him?

1576
01:34:14,461 --> 01:34:17,897
<i>Why don't they do something?</i>

1577
01:34:20,233 --> 01:34:21,667
<i>They are.</i>
What...

1578
01:34:24,471 --> 01:34:28,641
do...you...

1579
01:34:30,877 --> 01:34:32,511
want?

1580
01:34:34,322 --> 01:34:37,609
<i>What do I want?</i>

1581
01:34:38,043 --> 01:34:39,611
<i>What do I want?</i>

1582
01:34:41,246 --> 01:34:43,047
<i>What I want...</i>

1583
01:34:45,058 --> 01:34:46,559
<i>I want out!</i>

1584
01:34:46,935 --> 01:34:48,269
<i>I want to feel fresh air</i>
<i>against my skin.</i>

1585
01:34:48,536 --> 01:34:50,838
<i>I want to feel people</i>
<i>around me.</i>

1586
01:34:51,139 --> 01:34:53,040
<i>No.</i>

1587
01:34:53,041 --> 01:34:54,042
<i>It would cost too much money</i>

1588
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:55,976
<i>taking care of me</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

1589
01:34:55,977 --> 01:34:57,745
<i>They never do that.</i>

1590
01:34:57,746 --> 01:35:00,148
<i>But-- But maybe</i>
<i>there's a way</i>

1591
01:35:00,148 --> 01:35:02,150
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

1592
01:35:03,652 --> 01:35:06,087
<i>Yes! There is a way!</i>

1593
01:35:06,087 --> 01:35:08,097
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is put me on display</i>

1594
01:35:08,098 --> 01:35:09,607
<i>and people</i>
<i>will pay to see me.</i>

1595
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:11,617
<i>Lots of people.</i>
<i>Put me in a fancy coffin</i>

1596
01:35:12,118 --> 01:35:13,986
<i>with windows in it,</i>
<i>and take me out where people</i>

1597
01:35:13,986 --> 01:35:15,887
<i>are spending money</i>
<i>and having fun.</i>

1598
01:35:15,888 --> 01:35:17,890
<i>Take me to the beaches</i>
<i>and the county fairs</i>

1599
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,891
<i>and the 4th of July</i>
<i>celebrations</i>

1600
01:35:18,891 --> 01:35:20,893
<i>and all the church bazaars.</i>

1601
01:35:20,893 --> 01:35:22,828
<i>They've seen</i>
<i>the pin-headed girl</i> <i>from Timbuktu</i>

1602
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:23,829
<i>or the dog-faced man</i>

1603
01:35:23,829 --> 01:35:25,330
<i>who crawls on his belly</i>
<i>like a reptile.</i>

1604
01:35:25,331 --> 01:35:27,308
<i>But they're not real freaks.</i>
<i>They were born that way.</i>

1605
01:35:27,308 --> 01:35:29,310
<i>They were made</i>
<i>that way by God.</i>

1606
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:31,312
<i>But this thing here</i>
<i>in his fancy coffin</i>

1607
01:35:31,312 --> 01:35:33,247
<i>was made by people--</i>

1608
01:35:33,248 --> 01:35:35,250
<i>by you and me</i>
<i>and the lady next door--</i>

1609
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,684
<i>and that takes</i>
<i>a lot of planning</i>

1610
01:35:36,684 --> 01:35:38,085
<i>and costs a lot of money.</i>

1611
01:35:38,086 --> 01:35:40,096
<i>Advertise me as the only</i>
<i>piece of meat in the world</i>

1612
01:35:40,597 --> 01:35:42,098
<i>that can talk through</i>
<i>the back of its head.</i>

1613
01:35:42,098 --> 01:35:44,508
<i>And if that</i>
<i>doesn't pull them in,</i> <i>then-- then-- then--</i>

1614
01:35:45,043 --> 01:35:47,045
<i>then bill me as the last man</i>
<i>on earth who joined the Army.</i>

1615
01:35:47,045 --> 01:35:49,047
<i>Because the army makes men.</i>

1616
01:35:49,047 --> 01:35:50,524
<i>So rally around</i>
<i>the flag, boys--</i>

1617
01:35:50,524 --> 01:35:52,526
<i>your flag, their flag,</i>
<i>anybody's flag--</i>

1618
01:35:52,526 --> 01:35:53,460
<i>because the flag</i>
<i>needs soldiers,</i>

1619
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:56,379
<i>and the army makes men.</i>

1620
01:35:56,380 --> 01:36:01,359
I...want...out...

1621
01:36:01,627 --> 01:36:04,563
so...people...

1622
01:36:05,064 --> 01:36:08,320
can...see...

1623
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,089
what...I am.

1624
01:36:11,089 --> 01:36:15,326
Put me...in...

1625
01:36:15,327 --> 01:36:18,563
a...

1626
01:36:18,563 --> 01:36:22,466
c-carnival...show

1627
01:36:22,467 --> 01:36:26,437
where they...can

1628
01:36:26,438 --> 01:36:28,907
look...at me.

1629
01:36:28,907 --> 01:36:31,943
Let...me out.

1630
01:36:31,943 --> 01:36:35,880
Well, what could we
have expected?

1631
01:36:36,882 --> 01:36:39,317
Tell him, uh...

1632
01:36:39,317 --> 01:36:41,252
Tell him we'll do
everything we can,

1633
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:44,022
but, uh, his condition
won't permit him to be moved.

1634
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:45,723
For the present, that is.

1635
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:48,927
Be sure to say
"for the present."

1636
01:36:57,903 --> 01:36:59,271
If...

1637
01:37:00,839 --> 01:37:01,781
you...

1638
01:37:04,117 --> 01:37:07,887
won't...let...

1639
01:37:08,154 --> 01:37:10,990
people see me,

1640
01:37:11,157 --> 01:37:12,625
then...

1641
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:15,928
kill me.

1642
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:32,711
He's upset.
Understandably so.

1643
01:37:33,212 --> 01:37:34,713
Ask him what his name is.

1644
01:37:54,233 --> 01:37:57,455
These shutters are to be closed
at all times.

1645
01:37:57,456 --> 01:37:59,458
What's he saying?

1646
01:37:59,892 --> 01:38:02,361
He says, "Kill me."

1647
01:38:02,361 --> 01:38:04,696
Over and over again.
"Kill me."

1648
01:38:08,434 --> 01:38:11,746
[General]
Tell him we'll do everything we can to make him comfortable.

1649
01:38:11,746 --> 01:38:13,214
For now, he needs rest.

1650
01:38:13,214 --> 01:38:16,091
Tell him we'll give him
a sedative and come back later.

1651
01:38:16,092 --> 01:38:18,035
And try to get his name.

1652
01:38:20,004 --> 01:38:22,873
You're not to mention
what has happened here to anyone.

1653
01:38:22,873 --> 01:38:25,775
I'll hold you collectively
responsible for any breach.

1654
01:38:25,776 --> 01:38:28,712
If new orders are received
in view of the new situation which has developed,

1655
01:38:28,712 --> 01:38:30,714
you'll be notified.

1656
01:38:31,215 --> 01:38:32,223
Well?

1657
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,961
He won't wait
for an answer.

1658
01:38:36,962 --> 01:38:39,898
All he says is

1659
01:38:39,898 --> 01:38:44,177
"Kill me, kill me, kill me."

1660
01:38:46,555 --> 01:38:49,491
Don't you have some message
for him, Padre?

1661
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:52,827
You could at least tell him

1662
01:38:52,828 --> 01:38:54,462
to put his faith in God,
couldn't you?

1663
01:38:55,831 --> 01:38:58,308
I'll pray for him
for the rest of my days,

1664
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:01,110
but I will not risk
testing his faith

1665
01:39:01,111 --> 01:39:02,912
against your stupidity.

1666
01:39:07,384 --> 01:39:09,352
Well, you're a hell
of a priest, aren't you?

1667
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:12,788
He's the product
of your profession,

1668
01:39:12,789 --> 01:39:15,091
not mine.

1669
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,128
[door opens]
Clear the room.

1670
01:39:19,129 --> 01:39:21,631
Give him a light sedative,
nurse.

1671
01:39:23,133 --> 01:39:25,635
<i>[Joe]</i>
<i>They're going away. Why?</i>

1672
01:39:25,635 --> 01:39:27,536
<i>Why don't they get it</i>
<i>over with and kill me?</i>

1673
01:39:28,938 --> 01:39:31,240
<i>But you're still here.</i>

1674
01:39:31,241 --> 01:39:33,743
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>what I'm tapping to you?</i>

1675
01:39:33,743 --> 01:39:36,746
<i>I'm asking you to kill me.</i>

1676
01:39:36,746 --> 01:39:38,748
<i>Please do.</i>

1677
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:01,671
[syringe clicks]

1678
01:40:02,138 --> 01:40:03,973
O my God,

1679
01:40:04,908 --> 01:40:07,243
I'm heartily sorry

1680
01:40:07,243 --> 01:40:09,645
for having offended thee.

1681
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:13,949
And I detest all my sins,

1682
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:16,285
not because of Thy judgment,
O Lord,

1683
01:40:16,286 --> 01:40:18,988
but because
thou art all good

1684
01:40:18,988 --> 01:40:22,124
and deserving
of all my love.

1685
01:40:29,098 --> 01:40:31,100
I firmly resolve,

1686
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:34,336
with the help of thy grace,

1687
01:40:34,337 --> 01:40:37,606
to sin no more, to avoid
all the occasions of sin.

1688
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:41,944
Amen.

1689
01:40:49,027 --> 01:40:50,995
<i>Oh, nurse--</i>

1690
01:40:50,995 --> 01:40:54,974
<i>beautiful,</i>
<i>beautiful nurse--</i>

1691
01:40:54,975 --> 01:40:56,876
<i>thank you,</i>

1692
01:40:56,877 --> 01:41:00,221
<i>thank you, thank you.</i>

1693
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:02,223
<i>Dear God,</i>
<i>thank her for me.</i> [sighs]

1694
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:04,191
<i>Be sweet to her, God.</i>

1695
01:41:04,192 --> 01:41:06,621
<i>Make her happy.</i>
<i>Make her beautiful.</i>

1696
01:41:06,622 --> 01:41:09,157
<i>Make everything she wants</i>
<i>come true!</i>

1697
01:41:09,658 --> 01:41:11,159
<i>Make everyone love her!</i>

1698
01:41:13,162 --> 01:41:14,663
No!

1699
01:41:16,165 --> 01:41:17,642
No.

1700
01:41:17,642 --> 01:41:18,643
Leave the room.

1701
01:41:18,643 --> 01:41:22,813
<i>Oh, somebody stopped her.</i>

1702
01:41:22,814 --> 01:41:25,057
<i>Why?</i>

1703
01:41:25,058 --> 01:41:28,670
I said,
"Leave the room."

1704
01:41:29,171 --> 01:41:30,906
Give me the key.

1705
01:41:30,906 --> 01:41:33,375
<i>What's happening?</i>

1706
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,243
The key?

1707
01:41:38,647 --> 01:41:40,148
Go on.

1708
01:41:42,084 --> 01:41:44,562
<i>She's going.</i>

1709
01:41:44,562 --> 01:41:47,197
<i>I can feel her</i>
<i>moving toward the door.</i>

1710
01:41:47,198 --> 01:41:50,067
<i>He's sending her away.</i>

1711
01:41:50,067 --> 01:41:52,002
<i>Why?</i>

1712
01:41:52,003 --> 01:41:53,904
<i>First they</i>
<i>close the shutters,</i>

1713
01:41:53,904 --> 01:41:57,883
<i>and now they're</i>
<i>sending her away.</i>

1714
01:41:57,884 --> 01:42:00,353
<i>Why did they</i>
<i>close the shutters?</i>

1715
01:42:02,589 --> 01:42:05,091
<i>Why is he</i>
<i>sending her away?</i>

1716
01:42:06,593 --> 01:42:09,529
<i>Why won't they</i>
<i>let me talk?</i>

1717
01:42:09,929 --> 01:42:13,432
<i>Because I'm a secret</i>
<i>or something?</i>

1718
01:42:13,433 --> 01:42:15,435
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

1719
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:18,805
<i>She's gone.</i>

1720
01:42:20,306 --> 01:42:22,308
<i>Good-bye, nurse.</i>

1721
01:42:23,818 --> 01:42:26,320
<i>You're gone,</i>

1722
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,322
<i>and I'm a secret.</i>

1723
01:42:29,824 --> 01:42:31,826
<i>Oh, no. Not that again.</i>

1724
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:39,275
<i>I-- I thought</i>
<i>they'd be glad</i>

1725
01:42:39,275 --> 01:42:42,211
<i>that I found a way to--</i>

1726
01:42:42,211 --> 01:42:44,213
<i>to talk to them.</i>

1727
01:42:45,214 --> 01:42:47,216
<i>But they're not.</i>

1728
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,723
<i>The only thing on this earth</i>
<i>I'm any good for</i>

1729
01:42:55,157 --> 01:42:57,692
<i>they won't let me do.</i>

1730
01:42:58,194 --> 01:42:59,195
<i>All they want is to push me</i>

1731
01:42:59,195 --> 01:43:03,199
<i>back into the darkness</i>
<i>down here</i>

1732
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:06,068
<i>so they won't ever</i>
<i>see me again.</i>

1733
01:43:06,068 --> 01:43:07,478
[door closes]

1734
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:10,915
<i>He's gone, too.</i>

1735
01:43:10,916 --> 01:43:14,219
<i>Well, now I know.</i>

1736
01:43:14,219 --> 01:43:16,154
<i>They'll never let me out.</i>

1737
01:43:18,089 --> 01:43:21,459
<i>They'll keep me a secret here</i>
<i>until someday,</i>

1738
01:43:21,459 --> 01:43:24,328
<i>when I'm an old, old man,</i>

1739
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:27,231
<i>I'll sneak away</i>
<i>from them and die.</i>

1740
01:43:29,734 --> 01:43:31,235
<i>It isn't easy, though.</i>

1741
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:37,383
<i>Inside me,</i>
<i>I'm screaming and yelling</i>

1742
01:43:37,383 --> 01:43:39,752
<i>and howling</i>
<i>like a trapped animal...</i>

1743
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:44,557
<i>and nobody</i>
<i>pays any attention.</i>

1744
01:43:44,557 --> 01:43:47,459
<i>If I had arms,</i>
<i>I could kill myself.</i>

1745
01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:51,764
<i>If I had legs,</i>
<i>I could run away.</i>

1746
01:43:51,764 --> 01:43:53,599
<i>If I had a voice,</i>

1747
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,270
<i>I could talk and be some</i>
<i>kind of company for myself.</i>

1748
01:43:57,704 --> 01:43:59,605
<i>I could yell for help.</i>

1749
01:44:00,607 --> 01:44:03,384
<i>But nobody'd help me.</i>

1750
01:44:03,384 --> 01:44:06,253
