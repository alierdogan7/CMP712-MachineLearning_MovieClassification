1
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,454
Cambodia.

2
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,422
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

3
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:29,791
Another world, a secret world.

4
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:34,034
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

5
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:37,763
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

6
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:41,904
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,204
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

8
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,345
It was there, amidst the fighting...

9
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,883
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

10
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:55,682
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

11
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,883
...a man who was to change my life...

12
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:02,063
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

13
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:14,071
So here we go
with Voice of America...

14
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:16,267
...news for Southeast Asia.

15
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,608
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

16
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:23,080
Clouds too in Washington.

17
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:27,051
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

18
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,121
...within the next few days.

19
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:31,952
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

20
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:37,822
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

21
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:41,628
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

22
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:44,704
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

23
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:47,535
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

24
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:51,110
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

25
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:55,181
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

26
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:58,182
...for an American President
in 20 years.

27
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:12,762
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

28
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:15,937
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

29
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,799
...for a stay of the injunction...

30
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,498
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

31
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,702
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

32
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:29,179
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

33
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,630
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

34
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:13,720
Information. Information.

35
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:18,866
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

36
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:22,696
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

37
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,253
Mister, you want taxi?

38
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:48,725
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

39
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:19,318
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

40
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,393
What's all this shit?

41
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:29,836
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,006
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

43
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,070
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

44
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,714
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

45
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,851
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

46
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:46,418
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

47
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,730
What the fuck is that on your head?

48
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:04,728
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

49
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:09,036
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

50
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:13,039
No, I just came from the airport.

51
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:16,974
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

52
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,810
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.

53
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:21,277
Thanks a lot.

54
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,335
What do you want to eat?

55
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:43,308
Want some eggs?

56
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:47,039
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

57
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:49,479
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

58
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,242
I'm having a café complet.

59
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,253
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

60
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:05,558
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

61
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,667
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

62
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,205
I read somewhere that they put...

63
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:17,171
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

64
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,539
What's the difference?

65
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:24,452
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

66
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,167
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

67
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,700
What was it? A rocket?

68
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,600
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

69
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:55,915
I've been looking for you.

70
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,675
I left a message for you.

71
00:06:57,886 --> 00:06:59,911
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

72
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:03,056
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

73
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:06,625
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

74
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:10,154
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

75
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:12,856
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

76
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:14,893
We're going.

77
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,661
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

78
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,831
Where you going, Schanberg?

79
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:50,837
Neak Luong.

80
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,301
Neak Luong's closed.

81
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:56,273
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

82
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,970
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

83
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:05,084
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

84
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,154
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

85
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,885
Let's go!

86
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,930
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

87
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:33,880
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

88
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,411
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

89
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:40,918
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

90
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,181
You don't know anything about it?

91
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:44,983
No, I don't.

92
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,449
All right.

93
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:50,787
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

94
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,024
...and then I'd like a comment.

95
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:57,098
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

96
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:01,401
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

97
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,167
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

98
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:07,178
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

99
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:11,014
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

100
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:15,583
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

101
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,690
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

102
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:21,055
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

103
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:25,323
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

104
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:30,171
No comment.

105
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,299
How many killed?

106
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:36,674
How many wounded?

107
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,980
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

108
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:51,487
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

109
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,495
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,038
This is just not good enough.

111
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,230
This is a big story...

112
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:44,674
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

113
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,972
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

114
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,173
I want to get down that river!

115
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,113
We should be down there now!

116
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:04,829
I'll be here.

117
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:08,892
Good night, Sydney.

118
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,775
- Messages?
- No, sir.

119
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:21,304
No, sir.

120
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:26,582
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

121
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:29,256
Let's get together again soon, okay?

122
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:30,822
- Bob?
- See you.

123
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,259
Bob?

124
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,352
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

125
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:38,760
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

126
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,936
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

127
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,434
Let's not start insulting each other.

128
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,368
Good night, Sydney.

129
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:50,744
All right, good night.

130
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,082
You've heard of pilot error?

131
00:11:58,286 --> 00:11:59,776
Computer malfunction?

132
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,121
They screwed up on the coordinates.

133
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:06,089
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

134
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,525
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

135
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,124
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

136
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:19,034
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

137
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,703
How many?

138
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:26,910
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

139
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:30,380
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

140
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:33,679
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

141
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,851
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

142
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,756
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

143
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,063
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

144
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,067
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

145
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,737
Americans take themselves so seriously.

146
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:55,740
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

147
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:59,539
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

148
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:02,272
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

149
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,541
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

150
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:05,742
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

151
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,354
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

152
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,855
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

153
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:16,696
The Yanks all at sea...

154
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,628
- All right?
- Very possible.

155
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,272
Let's go then!

156
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,771
This is good work.

157
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:12,977
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

158
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,317
One hundred!

159
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,835
- All right?
- All right.

160
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,373
Nice going, Pran.

161
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:39,800
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

162
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:44,444
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

163
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,065
Tell me what she's saying.

164
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:16,866
She needs help.

165
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:23,443
Her shop was destroyed last night.

166
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:26,085
Her husband killed.

167
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:27,515
How many bombs?

168
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:30,719
She doesn't know.

169
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,851
Does she know where the hospital is?

170
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,961
"Just over there."

171
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,501
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

172
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:50,940
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

173
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:54,543
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

174
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,685
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

175
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:00,818
"Five."

176
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,723
Her husband was killed already.

177
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,291
What's this?

178
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:11,527
What are these guys over here?

179
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,772
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

180
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,888
They kill a lot of villagers.

181
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,826
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

182
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,060
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

183
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:52,262
...then set the rags alight.

184
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,666
Film! No film!

185
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,365
I know there's no film.

186
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,702
No camera!

187
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,037
No camera!

188
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,574
It's all right.

189
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,984
Just take it easy.

190
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,516
Tell them we're jour...

191
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:23,602
Come on! Get in!

192
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:09,409
I'm worried.

193
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,251
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

194
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,251
They accuse me and they arrest me.

195
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,315
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

196
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,819
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

197
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:33,663
I want some cigarettes.

198
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,310
And I need to take a leak.

199
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,472
Would you tell them I need to piss?

200
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,130
He said, "No piss."

201
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,103
What does that mean?

202
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,510
That's no piss.

203
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,249
I've had enough of this bullshit.

204
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:22,912
I got a story to get to New York!

205
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,459
Don't leave me!

206
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:41,603
I won't leave you.

207
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,844
They brought in the whole press corps!

208
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:56,380
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

209
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,954
I am going to tell you something.

210
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:10,857
I'm walking out of here.

211
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,397
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

212
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,659
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

213
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,805
...and I am walking out of here!

214
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:24,840
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

215
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:37,384
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

216
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:39,388
It's still a restricted area.

217
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:41,857
Now, if you look across the river...

218
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:44,997
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

219
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,996
...who moved in over
the past few days.

220
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,432
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

221
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:54,130
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

222
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,737
Get in the chopper now!

223
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,502
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

224
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,909
That won't stop my story!

225
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:06,585
What is this?

226
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:09,813
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

227
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:12,925
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

228
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,958
If anybody ever reads about this...

229
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,858
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

230
00:23:58,038 --> 00:23:59,232
Good morning.

231
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:01,063
What time is it?

232
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,567
Six o'clock.

233
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:06,911
Shit.

234
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,342
Telex for you.

235
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:10,450
You been to the telex?

236
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,218
We made the front page.

237
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,388
Sure.

238
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,550
We must be doing something right.

239
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,128
My wife is very worried.

240
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,366
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

241
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,309
Well, Pran...

242
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:42,915
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

243
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,445
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

244
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,816
...the future could be very bad.

245
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:52,989
What do you think?

246
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,394
I don't know.

247
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,265
I don't know either.

248
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,006
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

249
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:08,640
Let's get going.

250
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,577
All right.

251
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,147
Don't go back to sleep.

252
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,444
I won't.

253
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:30,659
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

254
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:32,889
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

255
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,536
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

256
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:39,001
Now look at all this fucking mess!

257
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,444
In America, everybody got a good car.

258
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,051
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

259
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:57,314
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

260
00:25:57,524 --> 00:25:59,719
Mercedes, number one!

261
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,785
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

262
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,234
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

263
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,494
Mercedes, number one, okay?

264
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:49,834
What did he say?

265
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:53,069
He said he thought all
American people left already.

266
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:55,648
Made in the USA.

267
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,177
Are we winning?

268
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,181
No, you're not winning.

269
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,721
What should we do?

270
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:08,156
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

271
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,463
The first section came
by Route number 36.

272
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,831
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

273
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,529
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

274
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,407
He doesn't know how many.

275
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,600
They expect an attack today.

276
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:26,302
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

277
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:27,912
- Why there?
- Don't know.

278
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:30,049
How many mortar rounds you have...?

279
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:48,060
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

280
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:52,968
Come on, let's get him out of here!

281
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:21,998
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

282
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,136
I'm not happy here, Syd.

283
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:26,238
Jon, I'm leaving.

284
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,065
Syd, come on!

285
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:29,397
Come on!

286
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,457
Sydney, this way!

287
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,576
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

288
00:29:57,164 --> 00:30:00,099
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

289
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,201
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

290
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:06,304
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

291
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:07,404
I can't eat.

292
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:12,443
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

293
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,240
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

294
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,613
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

295
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,415
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

296
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:27,856
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

297
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:31,394
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

298
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:35,557
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

299
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,586
No more electricity.

300
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:33,485
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

301
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:35,662
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

302
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:38,194
Alan, this country's split apart.

303
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,198
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

304
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,494
Any port.

305
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:48,471
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

306
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:52,236
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

307
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,940
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

308
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:02,884
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

309
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,354
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

310
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,528
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

311
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:13,599
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

312
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,395
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

313
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:18,866
Dith Pran and family.

314
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,096
Right.

315
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:26,276
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

316
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,213
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

317
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:35,185
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

318
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:37,686
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

319
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:40,792
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

320
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,122
What about the airlift?

321
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,888
We're taking it with us.

322
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:49,099
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

323
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:51,668
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

324
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:56,739
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

325
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:11,679
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

326
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:21,132
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

327
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:25,270
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

328
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,245
I'm sorry. I'm late.

329
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:43,717
Where you been?

330
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:46,787
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

331
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:48,620
Yes. I'm sorry.

332
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:54,622
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

333
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:58,532
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

334
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:03,766
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

335
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,811
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

336
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:09,447
6 p.m.

337
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:14,451
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

338
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:16,645
This is a newspaper.

339
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:21,355
How about update tomorrow?

340
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,997
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

341
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:38,876
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

342
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:40,977
Good news?

343
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,978
No, not good news.

344
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,719
They say that when
this place goes up...

345
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:58,723
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

346
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:03,629
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

347
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,907
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

348
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:13,436
Do you want to stay
or leave?

349
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:23,179
And how about you?

350
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:26,256
That's none of your business.

351
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:34,928
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

352
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:39,699
I know.

353
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,100
You love my family.

354
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:49,280
But me, I'm reporter too.

355
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,473
You know what I mean?

356
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,329
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

357
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:11,902
Take it easy.

358
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:20,037
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

359
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:35,648
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

360
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:38,618
This is the last check.

361
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:44,054
Last check. This is the last check!

362
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,160
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

363
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:55,532
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

364
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:57,772
Now, I want you to go right now!

365
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,803
I want you to leave now!

366
00:38:00,013 --> 00:38:02,106
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

367
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,757
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

368
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:24,233
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

369
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:27,065
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

370
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:30,504
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

371
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,453
Have you seen Pran?

372
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:46,647
No, I haven't.

373
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:48,451
Where is he?

374
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:54,262
Well, it's been real.

375
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:01,262
They're gonna miss it.

376
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,566
Why don't you check around
the other side?

377
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:08,271
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

378
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:22,827
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

379
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:25,224
No, have you looked at the hotel?

380
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,296
He's at the post office!

381
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,292
The post office!

382
00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:00,228
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

383
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,695
Move your asses out of here!

384
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:04,636
Hold those doors!

385
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:11,543
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

386
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,917
Yes, sir, what's your name?

387
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:30,493
Dith Pran family, sir.

388
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,460
Dith Pran family?

389
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,997
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

390
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:37,959
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

391
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,435
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

392
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,348
Rockoff, help me!

393
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:03,512
Run!

394
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:05,473
There's no time!

395
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:15,020
Wait a minute.

396
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:19,748
Smile.

397
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:47,744
Jon.

398
00:44:48,321 --> 00:44:49,413
Hello, Sydney.

399
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,741
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

400
00:45:13,513 --> 00:45:14,810
Who told you that?

401
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,512
The British Embassy.

402
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:51,677
Khmer Rouge coming.

403
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:55,047
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

404
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:00,784
No more fighting!

405
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,484
I be right back!

406
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:20,469
No more fighting! No more war!

407
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:22,237
What do you think?

408
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:25,071
I don't like the look of this.

409
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:29,976
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

410
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:33,117
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

411
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:36,583
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

412
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:46,389
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

413
00:48:47,226 --> 00:48:49,956
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

414
00:48:50,162 --> 00:48:52,528
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

415
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:07,175
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

416
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,074
Okay, let's have her over.

417
00:49:14,887 --> 00:49:19,483
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

418
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:22,417
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

419
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:25,923
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

420
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:28,726
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

421
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,734
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

422
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:06,094
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

423
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,739
For God's sake, back it up now!

424
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:28,010
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

425
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,817
They won't let him in.

426
00:51:53,412 --> 00:51:54,538
All right?

427
00:58:13,425 --> 00:58:14,357
Okay?

428
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,753
Looks all right.

429
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:17,232
I'm coming!

430
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,175
Just a minute! He's with me!

431
01:01:27,452 --> 01:01:29,283
He's with The New York Times!

432
01:01:29,488 --> 01:01:32,685
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

433
01:01:33,258 --> 01:01:36,659
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

434
01:01:36,928 --> 01:01:39,590
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

435
01:01:40,565 --> 01:01:44,399
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

436
01:01:44,603 --> 01:01:48,004
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

437
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:50,868
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

438
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:54,204
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

439
01:01:54,412 --> 01:01:58,974
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

440
01:01:59,184 --> 01:02:03,484
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

441
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:07,818
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

442
01:02:08,026 --> 01:02:12,588
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

443
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:14,264
...are not clear.

444
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:22,605
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

445
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,264
That's the consul.

446
01:02:58,543 --> 01:03:01,478
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

447
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:09,482
Look, piss off! Please!

448
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:12,816
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

449
01:03:20,565 --> 01:03:22,556
First, the main points of the news.

450
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:24,291
BBC, Dougal.

451
01:03:27,038 --> 01:03:29,871
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

452
01:03:30,075 --> 01:03:33,909
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

453
01:03:34,846 --> 01:03:38,782
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

454
01:03:38,984 --> 01:03:40,042
...Hugh Elder.

455
01:03:41,987 --> 01:03:44,114
Where do they get this crap?

456
01:03:44,656 --> 01:03:47,784
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

457
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:51,418
Could we not all look at once, please?

458
01:03:52,197 --> 01:03:55,792
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

459
01:03:56,534 --> 01:03:57,364
You're kidding.

460
01:03:57,569 --> 01:04:01,027
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

461
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:04,208
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

462
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:06,138
With specially trained hens.

463
01:04:07,445 --> 01:04:11,643
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

464
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,613
...like their regular fowl.

465
01:04:13,818 --> 01:04:18,346
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

466
01:04:19,424 --> 01:04:20,482
I told you.

467
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,624
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

468
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:28,458
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

469
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:31,761
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

470
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,597
...be handed over to them.

471
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:36,535
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

472
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:38,834
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

473
01:04:39,044 --> 01:04:42,480
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

474
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:46,617
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

475
01:06:15,992 --> 01:06:19,723
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

476
01:06:19,929 --> 01:06:22,558
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

477
01:06:22,766 --> 01:06:25,701
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

478
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:29,671
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

479
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:35,176
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

480
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:37,772
Half of them are under 15.

481
01:06:38,483 --> 01:06:41,419
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

482
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,609
Can you help?

483
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:45,389
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

484
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:47,650
I'd prefer it if it was you.

485
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,463
What did you do that for?

486
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:03,069
The guy's insecure enough already.

487
01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:07,872
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

488
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:14,146
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

489
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,716
...and the Cambodians out.

490
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:56,532
If you have papers,
you have a name.

491
01:07:56,737 --> 01:07:58,932
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

492
01:07:59,706 --> 01:08:02,335
Look, I fight for five years.

493
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:04,342
Useless war.

494
01:08:07,148 --> 01:08:08,115
Fuck!

495
01:08:10,518 --> 01:08:13,283
Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

496
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:17,255
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

497
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,321
Does Syd know how serious this is?

498
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:23,192
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

499
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:28,028
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

500
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,434
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

501
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:34,839
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

502
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:38,950
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

503
01:08:39,151 --> 01:08:40,379
It's worth a try.

504
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:44,485
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

505
01:08:59,006 --> 01:09:01,338
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

506
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,305
Give me two or three weeks.

507
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:06,838
If you get there first, let me know.

508
01:09:07,415 --> 01:09:10,145
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

509
01:09:10,985 --> 01:09:14,716
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

510
01:09:15,624 --> 01:09:17,615
I got no time to give you.

511
01:09:19,228 --> 01:09:20,991
Swain's got an idea.

512
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:29,401
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

513
01:09:29,606 --> 01:09:32,131
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

514
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:35,369
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

515
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,569
I don't think so.

516
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:39,109
Give him your passport.

517
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:41,478
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

518
01:09:41,686 --> 01:09:42,745
Khmer Rouge took everything.

519
01:09:42,955 --> 01:09:44,980
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

520
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:46,054
Fuck!

521
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:49,253
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

522
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:53,489
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

523
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:57,263
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

524
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,960
We'll find the film.

525
01:10:01,142 --> 01:10:03,474
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

526
01:10:03,677 --> 01:10:05,235
No, I haven't got any film!

527
01:10:05,446 --> 01:10:10,077
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

528
01:10:12,787 --> 01:10:15,051
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

529
01:10:15,257 --> 01:10:17,452
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

530
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:18,759
Shit!

531
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:23,062
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

532
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:26,599
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

533
01:10:31,675 --> 01:10:34,508
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

534
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:38,940
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

535
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,048
What?

536
01:10:41,386 --> 01:10:45,220
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

537
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,286
Come on down here.

538
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:50,828
Go to the end of the hall there.

539
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,155
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

540
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:57,700
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

541
01:10:57,904 --> 01:11:01,169
Syd, I have got the camera...

542
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,467
...I have got the film...

543
01:11:03,944 --> 01:11:06,937
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

544
01:11:11,652 --> 01:11:13,882
All right. Don't smile.

545
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:19,550
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

546
01:11:19,995 --> 01:11:21,360
Stop, please.

547
01:11:21,563 --> 01:11:24,556
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

548
01:11:39,513 --> 01:11:40,639
Okay, cover it.

549
01:11:46,388 --> 01:11:48,618
This fucking paper, I don't know.

550
01:11:49,357 --> 01:11:51,952
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

551
01:11:54,096 --> 01:11:55,825
Ankertill Brewer.

552
01:11:56,699 --> 01:11:59,133
Ankertill Brewer.

553
01:12:14,752 --> 01:12:17,084
Getting an image.
Look at it.

554
01:12:17,288 --> 01:12:18,847
Look, the bugger's face.

555
01:12:19,058 --> 01:12:21,322
It sure is. Come on.

556
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:23,523
Come on.

557
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,622
Come on.

558
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,724
Now fix it.

559
01:12:30,437 --> 01:12:31,870
That's good.

560
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:37,472
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

561
01:12:37,778 --> 01:12:39,109
Goddamn it.

562
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:42,177
Goddamn this paper!

563
01:12:42,383 --> 01:12:45,649
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

564
01:12:55,098 --> 01:12:56,690
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

565
01:12:58,835 --> 01:12:59,893
I did it.

566
01:13:02,138 --> 01:13:03,571
Let me have that.

567
01:13:06,143 --> 01:13:07,303
It's fading.

568
01:13:08,245 --> 01:13:09,212
Take it out.

569
01:13:09,413 --> 01:13:13,214
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

570
01:13:13,418 --> 01:13:15,181
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

571
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:16,445
Fuck!

572
01:13:17,555 --> 01:13:19,022
Goddamn it!

573
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:26,430
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

574
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:28,030
Could I just...?

575
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:30,298
I'll just do it myself, okay?

576
01:13:30,503 --> 01:13:33,837
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

577
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:35,799
Fuck.

578
01:13:37,177 --> 01:13:38,109
Sorry.

579
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:53,989
That's it.

580
01:14:10,715 --> 01:14:12,114
It's perfect.

581
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:14,577
Perfect.

582
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:31,666
Welcome to New York. We got it.

583
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:34,032
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

584
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,937
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

585
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:40,806
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

586
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:43,482
This is the last call for passports.

587
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:45,913
Can I have your passports, please?

588
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:48,656
Can I have your passports, please?

589
01:14:50,058 --> 01:14:51,047
Thank you.

590
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:53,418
Passports, ladies and gents.

591
01:14:54,764 --> 01:14:58,791
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

592
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:03,302
Your passports, please.

593
01:15:03,507 --> 01:15:05,668
On this passport depend my life.

594
01:15:07,344 --> 01:15:08,174
Thank you.

595
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:12,712
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

596
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:18,777
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

597
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:21,551
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

598
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,352
Come on, passports, please.

599
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,823
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

600
01:15:27,032 --> 01:15:28,226
Going...

601
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:29,564
...going...

602
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:35,231
...gone.

603
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:08,238
Is this lunch?

604
01:16:13,851 --> 01:16:14,715
What?

605
01:16:17,922 --> 01:16:19,981
It seems certain
that the majority...

606
01:16:20,191 --> 01:16:24,924
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

607
01:16:25,129 --> 01:16:28,497
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

608
01:16:28,801 --> 01:16:29,859
Hello again.

609
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:39,270
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

610
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,147
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

611
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:46,280
Now, listen, everybody.

612
01:16:48,222 --> 01:16:52,625
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

613
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:55,795
Probably in the next 24 hours.

614
01:16:56,498 --> 01:16:58,989
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

615
01:16:59,468 --> 01:17:01,493
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

616
01:17:12,082 --> 01:17:14,107
These so-called journalists
have no right...

617
01:17:14,318 --> 01:17:18,482
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

618
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:22,353
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

619
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,926
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

620
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:21,357
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

621
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:34,997
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

622
01:20:37,009 --> 01:20:39,273
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

623
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:41,105
Don't forget. All right?

624
01:20:41,313 --> 01:20:44,215
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

625
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:46,180
You had no right to keep him here!

626
01:20:46,386 --> 01:20:48,513
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

627
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:51,692
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

628
01:20:51,926 --> 01:20:53,985
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

629
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:57,187
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

630
01:21:02,871 --> 01:21:04,236
Goodbye, Rockoff.

631
01:21:26,664 --> 01:21:29,225
Tell my wife I love her...

632
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:31,766
...and look after all my children.

633
01:21:33,071 --> 01:21:36,507
She doesn't speak any English.

634
01:21:38,411 --> 01:21:39,810
Please...

635
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,074
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

636
01:22:20,223 --> 01:22:21,622
Dith Pran.

637
01:22:22,525 --> 01:22:25,757
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

638
01:22:25,963 --> 01:22:29,160
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

639
01:22:30,101 --> 01:22:33,094
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

640
01:22:33,705 --> 01:22:37,072
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

641
01:22:37,276 --> 01:22:38,106
In April 1975.

642
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:43,010
4144-5364...

643
01:23:14,984 --> 01:23:17,214
Pran is a resourceful man.

644
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:20,049
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

645
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:22,088
...and then he'll make his move.

646
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:41,206
Thank you for coming...

647
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,607
...and taking care of her
and her family.

648
01:23:43,816 --> 01:23:47,275
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

649
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:49,286
That's not true.

650
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:53,390
That's absolutely not true.

651
01:24:01,068 --> 01:24:03,195
It's not true. It's not.

652
01:24:04,473 --> 01:24:06,338
She doesn't believe you...

653
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:09,601
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

654
01:24:32,737 --> 01:24:33,931
You're a good man.

655
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:40,300
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

656
01:24:44,283 --> 01:24:45,614
You better go.

657
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:28,557
For the past 5 years...

658
01:26:29,132 --> 01:26:32,227
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

659
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:37,107
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

660
01:26:37,308 --> 01:26:41,370
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

661
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,278
As the President spoke...

662
01:26:43,482 --> 01:26:47,009
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

663
01:26:49,255 --> 01:26:53,157
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

664
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:55,327
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

665
01:26:55,695 --> 01:26:58,927
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

666
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:04,399
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

667
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:13,948
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

668
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:17,881
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

669
01:27:18,087 --> 01:27:19,611
We will aid Cambodia.

670
01:27:19,822 --> 01:27:24,225
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

671
01:32:27,429 --> 01:32:28,556
Sydney...

672
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:33,235
...I think of you often
and often my family.

673
01:32:33,903 --> 01:32:37,236
They tell us that God is dead.

674
01:32:37,473 --> 01:32:40,705
And now the party they call
the Angka...

675
01:32:40,911 --> 01:32:43,641
...will provide everything for us.

676
01:32:44,281 --> 01:32:47,217
He says Angka has identified...

677
01:32:47,419 --> 01:32:49,410
...and proclaims the existence...

678
01:32:49,621 --> 01:32:51,851
...of a bad new disease...

679
01:32:52,057 --> 01:32:56,961
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

680
01:32:57,163 --> 01:33:00,132
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

681
01:33:01,033 --> 01:33:05,061
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

682
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:08,073
The enemy is inside us.

683
01:33:08,575 --> 01:33:10,770
No one can be trusted.

684
01:33:20,054 --> 01:33:22,545
We must be like the ox...

685
01:33:22,757 --> 01:33:26,455
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

686
01:33:26,662 --> 01:33:30,098
No love but for the Angka.

687
01:33:34,804 --> 01:33:36,328
People starve...

688
01:33:37,674 --> 01:33:39,767
...but we must not grow food.

689
01:33:42,713 --> 01:33:44,681
We must honor the comrade children...

690
01:33:44,882 --> 01:33:48,147
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

691
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,216
Is anybody of us...

692
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,284
...a doctor...

693
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:21,013
...professor...

694
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:22,689
...and student?

695
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:24,955
Angka needs you.

696
01:34:25,794 --> 01:34:27,763
Angka has forgiven all the past.

697
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:43,771
Sydney...

698
01:34:44,815 --> 01:34:49,276
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

699
01:34:49,487 --> 01:34:52,149
...in the years
of the great struggle...

700
01:34:52,356 --> 01:34:56,453
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

701
01:34:57,529 --> 01:35:00,589
...because now is the year zero...

702
01:35:00,866 --> 01:35:03,528
...and everything is to start anew.

703
01:35:12,178 --> 01:35:14,340
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

704
01:35:14,782 --> 01:35:17,580
I must show no understanding.

705
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:20,246
Not of French or English.

706
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:22,952
I must have no past, Sydney.

707
01:35:24,259 --> 01:35:26,386
This is the year zero...

708
01:35:26,962 --> 01:35:29,192
...and nothing has gone before.

709
01:35:41,378 --> 01:35:45,212
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

710
01:35:45,616 --> 01:35:48,608
The war has killed love, Sydney.

711
01:35:49,052 --> 01:35:52,750
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

712
01:35:53,091 --> 01:35:56,458
And no one dare ask where they go.

713
01:35:56,828 --> 01:36:01,129
Here, only the silent survive.

714
01:41:45,481 --> 01:41:48,076
Mercedes, number one!

715
01:47:21,487 --> 01:47:25,890
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

716
01:47:28,495 --> 01:47:32,488
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

717
01:47:34,768 --> 01:47:38,261
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

718
01:47:38,606 --> 01:47:40,733
But I can't stand here tonight...

719
01:47:40,942 --> 01:47:43,604
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

720
01:47:43,811 --> 01:47:48,442
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

721
01:47:51,219 --> 01:47:54,656
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

722
01:47:54,857 --> 01:47:59,191
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

723
01:47:59,862 --> 01:48:02,296
...concerned themselves
with many things:

724
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:07,728
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

725
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:11,906
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

726
01:48:12,209 --> 01:48:16,510
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

727
01:48:17,482 --> 01:48:19,746
They had domestic concerns as well...

728
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:24,753
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

729
01:48:25,591 --> 01:48:29,288
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

730
01:48:29,495 --> 01:48:31,088
...in their own careers.

731
01:48:31,865 --> 01:48:34,561
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

732
01:48:34,768 --> 01:48:37,293
...were the Cambodians themselves.

733
01:48:37,704 --> 01:48:39,535
Not the people...

734
01:48:40,007 --> 01:48:41,999
...not the society...

735
01:48:42,477 --> 01:48:44,104
...not the country.

736
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:48,747
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

737
01:48:52,688 --> 01:48:54,451
Dith Pran and I...

738
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:57,181
...tried to record and bring home...

739
01:48:57,393 --> 01:49:01,160
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

740
01:49:01,698 --> 01:49:03,495
To human beings...

741
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:07,565
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

742
01:49:07,772 --> 01:49:09,603
...but who paid the price...

743
01:49:09,807 --> 01:49:12,002
...and took the beating for them.

744
01:49:17,482 --> 01:49:21,646
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

745
01:49:22,187 --> 01:49:23,814
I'm very honored...

746
01:49:24,489 --> 01:49:27,152
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

747
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:43,604
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

748
01:49:46,281 --> 01:49:49,045
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

749
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,649
I'm sorry.

750
01:49:53,722 --> 01:49:56,623
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

751
01:49:57,526 --> 01:50:00,086
Abe, meet my sister.

752
01:50:00,296 --> 01:50:02,127
I'm very happy to meet you.

753
01:50:02,331 --> 01:50:04,800
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

754
01:50:05,902 --> 01:50:06,869
One second.

755
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:10,267
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

756
01:50:10,474 --> 01:50:13,444
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

757
01:50:13,644 --> 01:50:16,511
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

758
01:50:25,657 --> 01:50:29,457
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

759
01:50:32,065 --> 01:50:34,761
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

760
01:50:34,968 --> 01:50:38,233
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

761
01:50:39,707 --> 01:50:42,437
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

762
01:50:42,643 --> 01:50:43,473
What?

763
01:50:43,878 --> 01:50:46,574
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

764
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,909
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

765
01:50:50,118 --> 01:50:52,848
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

766
01:50:54,756 --> 01:50:56,883
The fuck you didn't.

767
01:50:57,492 --> 01:51:00,985
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

768
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:03,529
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

769
01:51:03,733 --> 01:51:05,291
I'm doing everything I can.

770
01:51:05,501 --> 01:51:08,801
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

771
01:51:09,006 --> 01:51:12,271
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

772
01:51:12,476 --> 01:51:16,140
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

773
01:51:17,015 --> 01:51:19,040
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

774
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,913
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

775
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:30,425
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

776
01:51:30,963 --> 01:51:32,487
Life isn't a '40s movie.

777
01:51:32,698 --> 01:51:36,533
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

778
01:51:38,138 --> 01:51:40,936
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

779
01:51:45,746 --> 01:51:47,043
Congrats.

780
01:51:49,116 --> 01:51:51,676
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

781
01:51:51,886 --> 01:51:54,082
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

782
01:51:54,289 --> 01:51:57,156
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

783
01:51:57,359 --> 01:51:59,725
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

784
01:51:59,928 --> 01:52:03,660
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

785
01:52:04,334 --> 01:52:06,165
We made a mistake.

786
01:52:06,736 --> 01:52:09,330
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

787
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:12,065
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

788
01:52:12,276 --> 01:52:13,436
That is provocative...

789
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:17,045
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

790
01:52:17,248 --> 01:52:19,682
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

791
01:52:19,883 --> 01:52:21,442
Don't you believe them?

792
01:52:21,653 --> 01:52:25,521
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

793
01:52:25,724 --> 01:52:28,022
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

794
01:52:28,226 --> 01:52:30,718
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

795
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:33,296
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

796
01:52:33,499 --> 01:52:35,933
Will you be covering the boat people?

797
01:52:36,135 --> 01:52:37,261
No, I will not.

798
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:39,166
Do you want a cup of tea?

799
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:43,735
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

800
01:52:46,313 --> 01:52:48,942
I must have sent 500 letters.

801
01:52:54,455 --> 01:52:58,187
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

802
01:52:58,394 --> 01:53:01,090
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

803
01:53:01,597 --> 01:53:03,861
I don't know who I didn't write to.

804
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:13,002
I never really gave him any choice.

805
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:21,577
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

806
01:53:30,529 --> 01:53:33,988
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

807
01:53:37,303 --> 01:53:40,602
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

808
01:53:44,611 --> 01:53:47,136
But I never discussed it with him.

809
01:53:58,326 --> 01:54:01,262
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

810
01:54:07,303 --> 01:54:09,168
And I stayed because...

811
01:57:48,615 --> 01:57:50,481
I'm trapped, Sydney.

812
01:57:50,684 --> 01:57:54,882
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

813
01:57:55,522 --> 01:57:58,923
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

814
01:57:59,226 --> 01:58:01,320
I must take much care.

815
01:58:01,863 --> 01:58:05,924
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

816
01:58:06,468 --> 01:58:11,372
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

817
01:58:12,141 --> 01:58:16,043
And now they say we must fight them.

818
01:58:17,848 --> 01:58:22,046
I miss you, my wife, my children.

819
01:58:22,252 --> 01:58:25,710
And my heart hungers for news of you.

820
01:58:49,849 --> 01:58:51,373
New China Radio reports...

821
01:58:51,584 --> 01:58:54,884
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

822
01:58:55,089 --> 01:58:57,455
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

823
01:58:57,725 --> 01:59:00,455
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

824
01:59:00,661 --> 01:59:03,095
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

825
01:59:06,835 --> 01:59:08,200
Taxi driver, huh?

826
01:59:26,056 --> 01:59:27,887
I think you speak English.

827
01:59:28,358 --> 01:59:29,655
Sit down.

828
01:59:35,867 --> 01:59:38,392
You know, I love this country.

829
01:59:40,205 --> 01:59:43,004
I sacrificed everything for it.

830
01:59:44,477 --> 01:59:47,969
My wife died for the revolution.

831
01:59:49,883 --> 01:59:54,582
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

832
01:59:55,522 --> 01:59:59,084
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

833
02:00:00,928 --> 02:00:02,987
And they don't trust me.

834
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,364
I fear...

835
02:00:07,769 --> 02:00:10,102
...really fear for the future.

836
02:00:14,510 --> 02:00:18,003
I think you love my son.

837
02:00:21,117 --> 02:00:22,379
For his sake...

838
02:00:23,453 --> 02:00:24,852
...look after him.

839
02:00:29,493 --> 02:00:32,087
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

840
02:00:32,296 --> 02:00:34,764
If the Vietnamese get here...

841
02:00:34,965 --> 02:00:37,127
...Angka will destroy everything...

842
02:00:39,271 --> 02:00:40,829
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

843
02:03:50,182 --> 02:03:53,618
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

844
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:14,939
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

845
02:13:17,878 --> 02:13:21,837
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

846
02:13:22,049 --> 02:13:23,744
Abe, I've got some great news!

847
02:13:36,966 --> 02:13:40,026
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

848
02:13:40,236 --> 02:13:43,137
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

849
02:13:43,339 --> 02:13:45,433
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

850
02:13:45,642 --> 02:13:48,509
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

851
02:13:48,712 --> 02:13:51,340
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

852
02:13:51,715 --> 02:13:53,411
Is your mother there?

853
02:13:56,020 --> 02:13:57,180
When?

854
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:02,253
All right,
I want you to get this down.

855
02:14:03,095 --> 02:14:05,757
No, write it down. Write it down.

856
02:14:07,299 --> 02:14:09,426
I've got a message from your dad!

857
02:15:22,382 --> 02:15:23,576
How you been?

858
02:15:36,665 --> 02:15:37,689
Do you forgive me?

859
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,994
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
