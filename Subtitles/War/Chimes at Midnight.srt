1
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,797
Jesus, the days that we have seen!

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,882
(both chuckling)

3
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,886
Do you remember
since we lay all night in the windmill

4
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,097
in St. George's field?

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,141
No more of that, Master Shallow.

6
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,308
(Shallow laughs)

7
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,394
'Twas a merry night!

8
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,815
Is Jane Nightwork alive?

9
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,151
She lives, Master Shallow.

10
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,154
Doth she hold her own well?

11
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,739
Old.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,033
Old, Master Shallow.

13
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,828
Oh, no, she must be old.

14
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,247
She cannot choose but be old.

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,959
- (sighs)
- Certain she's old.

16
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:28,423
And had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork
before I came to Clement's Inn.

17
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,177
Jesus, the days that we have seen!

18
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,429
Ha, Sir John? Said I well?

19
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:37,432
We have heard the chimes at midnight,

20
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,100
Master Robert Shallow.

21
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:42,437
That we have! That we have! That we have!

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,439
In faith, Sir John, we have.

23
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,191
(bell tolling)

24
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:49,778
Jesus, the days that we have seen.

25
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,864
(tolling continues, fades)

26
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:05,186
NARRATOR: <i>King Richard II was murdered,</i>

27
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,482
<i>some say at the command
of the Duke Henry Bolingbroke,</i>

28
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,359
<i>in Pomfret Castle</i>

29
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,737
<i>on February the 14th, 1400.</i>

30
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,826
<i>Before this, the duke Henry
had been crowned king,</i>

31
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,454
<i>though the true heir to the realm
was Edmund Mortimer,</i>

32
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,374
<i>who was held prisoner by the Welsh rebels.</i>

33
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:30,461
<i>The new king was not hasty
to purchase his deliverance,</i>

34
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:34,757
<i>and to prove this,
Mortimer's cousins, the Percys,</i>

35
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,719
<i>came to the king unto Windsor.</i>

36
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,512
<i>There came Northumberland,</i>

37
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:42,849
<i>his son, Henry Percy, called Hotspur,</i>

38
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,517
<i>and Worcester,</i>

39
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:49,314
<i>whose purpose was ever
to procure malice and set things in a broil.</i>

40
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,775
Shall our coffers then be emptied
to redeem a traitor home?

41
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,737
- My liege ‒
- No, on the barren mountain let him starve.

42
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,739
For I shall never hold that man my friend

43
00:03:57,822 --> 00:04:02,285
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
to ransom home revolted Mortimer.

44
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:06,497
"Revolted Mortimer"? He never did fall off
my sovereign liege but by the chance of war.

45
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,875
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,

46
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,002
unapt to stir at these indignities.

47
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:15,506
And you have found me,
for accordingly you tread upon my patience.

48
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,425
Our house, my sovereign liege,

49
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,679
little deserves the scourge of greatness
to be used on it.

50
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,306
And that same greatness too,

51
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,851
which our own hands have helped
to make so portly.

52
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,978
Worcester, get thee gone,

53
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:32,440
for I do see danger
and disobedience in thine eye.

54
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,775
My lord ‒

55
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,653
Henceforth let me not hear you
speak of Mortimer,

56
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,615
or you shall hear in such a kind from me
as will displease you.

57
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,033
My good lord, hear me.

58
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:45,536
My Lord Northumberland,
we license your departure.

59
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,957
With your son.

60
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,476
"Speak of Mortimer."

61
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,978
Zounds, I will speak of him.

62
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,647
And let my soul want mercy
if I do not join with him.

63
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,148
Hear you, cousin, a word.

64
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,317
Hark you, Uncle, did not King Richard

65
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,320
then proclaim my brother, Edmund Mortimer,
heir to the crown?

66
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,947
NORTHUMBERLAND:
He did. Myself did hear it.

67
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,867
Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king that
wished him on the barren mountains starve.

68
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:28,997
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
or fill up chronicles in time to come,

69
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,499
that men of your nobility and power

70
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,335
did gage them both in an unjust behalf ‒

71
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,255
as both of you, God pardon it, have done ‒

72
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,925
to put down Richard,
that sweet, lovely rose,

73
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,344
and plant this thorn,
this canker Bolingbroke?

74
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,512
Peace, cousin.

75
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,514
By heavens, methinks it were an easy leap

76
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,142
to pluck bright honor
from the pale-faced moon

77
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:53,604
or dive into the bottom of the deep where
fathom line could never touch the ground,

78
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,357
and pluck up drowned honor by the locks.

79
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,776
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,655
Farewell, kinsman. I'll talk to you
when you are better tempered to attend.

81
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:05,575
Why, look, you, I am whipped
and scourged with rods,

82
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:10,580
nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.

83
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,373
In Richard's time ‒

84
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,917
What do you call the place
where I first bowed my knee

85
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,212
unto this king of smiles,
this Bolingbroke?

86
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,382
'Sblood! When you and he
came back from Ravenspurgh!

87
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:24,093
- At Berkeley Castle.
- Ah! You say true.

88
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:29,348
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me.

89
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,935
"Look, gentle Harry Percy."
And "Kind cousin."

90
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,480
Ah! The devil take such cozeners!

91
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:39,734
(bell tolling, faint)

92
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,446
God forgive me.
Good uncle, tell your tale, for I have done.

93
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,741
Nay, if you have not, to it again.
We will stay your leisure.

94
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,659
I've done, i'faith.

95
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,580
You, my lord, shall secretly
into the bosom creep

96
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,125
of that same noble prelate well-beloved,
the archbishop.

97
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,627
York, is it not?

98
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,129
I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.

99
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,840
And then the powers of Scotland and of York
to join with Mortimer's.

100
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,467
And so they shall.

101
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,304
Brother, farewell. No further go in this
than I by letter shall direct our course.

102
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,765
Farewell, good brother.
We shall thrive, I trust.

103
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:15,269
All studies here I solemnly defy,
save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke

104
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,147
and that same sword-and-buckler
Prince of Wales.

105
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,818
But that I think his father loves him not and
would be glad he met with some mischance,

106
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,945
I would have him poisoned
with a pot of ale.

107
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,280
- (bell tolling)
- (whistles)

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,283
(laughing)

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,662
(kisses, continues laughing)

110
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,085
Where's Falstaff?

111
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,797
- Fast asleep.
- And snoring like a horse.

112
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,637
I picked his pocket.

113
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,347
- (Falstaff snoring)
- (whispering) What hast thou found?

114
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,432
Nothing but this, my lord.

115
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,896
(snoring continues)

116
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,904
- (Falstaff snorts)
- (laughs)

117
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,490
FALSTAFF: How now, Hal?
What time of day is it, lad?

118
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:13,703
What the devil hast thou to do
with the time of day?

119
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,164
Unless hours were cups of sack,

120
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,834
clocks the tongues of bawds,
dials the signs of leaping houses

121
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,838
and the blessed sun himself
a fair, hot wench in flame-colored taffeta,

122
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,674
I see no reason
why thou shouldst be so superfluous

123
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,801
as to demand the time of the day.

124
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,803
Indeed you come near me now, Hal,

125
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:35,725
for we that take purses go by the moon.

126
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,062
How now! Who picked me pocket?

127
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:43,816
Hostess! Hostess!

128
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,777
- Sir John!
- I fell asleep here and had me pocket picked!

129
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:50,031
- (laughing)
- You think I keep thieves in my house?

130
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,575
My lord, I pray you, hear me!

131
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,702
Go to! I know you well enough!

132
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,079
- I know you, Sir John.
- (grumbles)

133
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,040
You owe me money, Sir John,

134
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,293
and now you pick a quarrel with me
to beguile me of it.

135
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,712
FALSTAFF:
This house is turned bawdy house!

136
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,881
- Bawdy house?
- Picked me pocket!

137
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,009
(all laughing)

138
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,804
We cannot lodge and board
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen

139
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,474
who live honestly
by the prick of their needles,

140
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,726
but it's thought we keep a bawdy house!

141
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,436
(laughing continues)

142
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,107
Shall I not take my knees in mine inn,
but I shall have my pocket picked?

143
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,318
You owe me money, Sir John!

144
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,070
What didst thou lose, Jack?

145
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,739
Wilt thou believe me, Hal? Some 40 pounds.

146
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,574
- What?
- (grunts)

147
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:39,372
And a gold seal ring of me grandfather's
worth some 40 mark.

148
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:42,083
You owe mine hostess money, Jack.

149
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,377
You lost the reckoning.

150
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,421
Item: a capon, two shillings and tuppence.

151
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:52,260
Item: sauce, fourpence. Item: sack,
two gallons, five shillings and eightpence.

152
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:55,930
Item: anchovies and sack after supper,
two and sixpence.

153
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,640
Item: bread, ha'pence.

154
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,810
- O monstrous.
- Hostess, come.

155
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,854
Thou must not be in this humor with me.

156
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,690
I forgive thee.

157
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,442
Fetch me a quart of sack.

158
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,445
- (cheering, laughing)
- Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal.

159
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,989
God forgive you for it.

160
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,283
Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing,

161
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:20,288
and now am, if a man should speak truly,
little better than one of the wicked.

162
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,789
(laughing)

163
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,293
I was as virtuously given
as a gentleman need to be ‒ virtuous enough.

164
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:29,213
Swore a little.
Diced not above seven times a week.

165
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:33,301
Went to a bawdy house
not above once in a quarter... of an hour.

166
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:35,636
Villainous company hath been the spoil of me.

167
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,181
If I have not forgotten
what the inside of a church is made of,

168
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:42,184
call me a peppercorn, a brewer's horse.

169
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,686
(Hal continues laughing)

170
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,313

00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,521
The prince and Poins
be not two errant cowards.

337
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,897
There's no equity stirring.

338
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,693
There's no more valor in that Poins
than in a wild duck.

339
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,112
(Hal, Poins shouting)

340
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,501
(shouting continues)

341
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:13,046
(grunting, shouting)

342
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,759
Jesus!

343
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,137
The thieves are scattered!

344
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,222
(Hal, Poins laughing)

345
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,100
- Each takes his fellow for an officer.
- Away, good Ned!

346
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,394
HAL: Falstaff sweats to death

347
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,521
and lards the lean earth
as he walks along.

348
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,231
POINS: How the rogue roared!

349
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,109
HAL: Were it not for laughing,
I should pity him!

350
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,905
(men murmuring)

351
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:41,074
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?

352
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,492
(murmuring quiets)

353
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,953
'Tis full three months
since I did see him last.

354
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:48,040
- My liege!
- Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?

355
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,208
I have, my liege.

356
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,504
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom,
how foul it is, what rank diseases grow.

357
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,007
They say young Percy and Lord Worcester
are 50,000 strong.

358
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,508
(murmuring resumes)

359
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,636
Here is Sir Walter Blunt, my lord,
new lighted from his horse.

360
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,262
My liege, Northumberland lies sick,

361
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,557
but a great power of English and of Scots
follow young Henry Percy.

362
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,769
Yea, there thou mak'st me sad

363
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,687
and mak'st me sin in envy

364
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:15,275
that my Lord Northumberland
should be the father to so blest a son.

365
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,861
A son that is the theme of honor's tongue.

366
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,950
Whilst I, in looking on the praise of him,
see riot and dishonor stain the brow

367
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,660
of my young Harry.

368
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,580
O, that it could be proved
that some night-tripping fairy

369
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:32,542
had exchanged in cradle clothes
our children where they lay.

370
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,337
Then would I have his Harry

371
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,589
and he mine.

372
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,633
Where does the Prince of Wales?

373
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,760
We do not know, my lord.

374
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,846
I would to God, my lords,
he could be found.

375
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:51,311
Inquire at London
'mongst the taverns there,

376
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,439
for there, they say, he daily doth frequent

377
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:57,275
with unrestrained, loose companions.

378
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,320
Even such, they say,
as stand in narrow lanes

379
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,823
and beat our watch and rob our passengers,

380
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,035
which he, young, wanton and effeminate boy,
takes on the point of honor

381
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,162
to support so dissolute a crew.

382
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,757
Got with much ease! (laughs)

383
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,595
The virtue of this jest will be
the incomprehensible lies

384
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,973
this same fat rogue will tell us now ‒

385
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,975
how 30 at least he fought with,

386
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,894
what wards, what blows ‒
(laughing continues)

387
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:36,106
what extremities he endured!

388
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,858
(groaning)

389
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,277
A plague on all cowards!

390
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,363
(groaning continues)

391
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,709
A plague on all cowards, still say I.

392
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,377
And a vengeance too.

393
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,962
Give me a cup of sack.

394
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,964
How now, Jack! Where hast thou been?

395
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,550
A plague on all cowards!

396
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,552
FALSTAFF: Go thy ways, old Jack.

397
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,220
Die when I wilt.

398
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,308
If manhood, good manhood,
be not forgot upon the face of the earth,

399
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,268
then I'm a shotten herring.

400
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,854
There lives not three good men
unhanged in England,

401
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,899
and one of them is fat and grows old,
God help the while.

402
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,693
How now, woolsack?

403
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,779
- A king's son.
- (bells pealing)

404
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:27,908
If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom
with a dagger of lath

405
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:31,203
and drive all thy subjects afore thee
like a flock of wild geese,

406
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:34,956
I'll never wear hair on me face more,
you Prince of Wales.

407
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,919
- Why, you whoreson round man!
- POINS: You fat guts!

408
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,420
What's the matter?

409
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,256
Are you not a coward?
Answer that! And Poins there.

410
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,093
Call me coward? You fat paunch!

411
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,638
I call thee coward? I'll see thee damned
ere I call thee coward.

412
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,808
But I'd give a thousand pounds
if I could run as fast as thou canst.

413
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,518
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

414
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,813
There be four of us here
have ta'en a thousand pound this morning.

415
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,815
A thousand pound? Where is it?

416
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:03,652
- Where is it, Jack?
- Where is it? Taken from us, it is.

417
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:07,155
- A hundred upon poor four of us.
- What, a hundred men?

418
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,908
I was at half-sword with a dozen of them
two hours together.

419
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,576
I have 'scaped by a miracle.

420
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,913
I am eight times thrust through the doublet,
four through the hose,

421
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,998
my buckler cut through and through,

422
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,459
my sword hacked like a handsaw!

423
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,461
<i>Ecce signum</i>. Let them speak.

424
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,047
- Speak, sirs!
- We four set upon some dozen.

425
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,465
Sixteen, at least.

426
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,386
And bound them. And as we were sharing,
some six or seven fresh men set upon us.

427
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,430
- What, fought you with them all?
- All? I know not what you call "all."

428
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,517
But if I fought not with 50 of them,
then I'm a bunch of radish.

429
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,645
If there were not 50 upon poor old Jack,
then I'm no two-legged creature.

430
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,231
Pray God
you have not murdered some of them.

431
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,818
Nay, that's... past praying for.

432
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,071
I have peppered two of them.
Two I'm sure I've paid for.

433
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,157
Two rogues in buckram cloaks.

434
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,661
I tell thee what, Hal ‒ I tell thee a lie,
spit in me face, call me "horse."

435
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:59,332
Thus I bore me point. Four rogues
in buckram cloaks let drive at me.

436
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,335
- Four?
- Four? Thou said but two even now.

437
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,045
Four, Hal. I told thee four.

438
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,632
These four came all afront
and mainly thrust at me.

439
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:12,429
I made me no more ado but took
all seven of their points in me target, thus.

440
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,682
Seven? Why, there were
but four even now.

441
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:19,603
- Uh, in buckram?
- Aye. Four in buckram cloaks.

442
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,439
Seven, by these hilts,
or I'm a villain else!

443
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,234
(whispers)
Let him alone. We shall have more anon.

444
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,028
Dost thou hear me, Hal?

445
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,489
- Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
- Do so, for it is worth the listening to.

446
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,701
These, uh, nine in buckram
that I told thee of ‒

447
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,869
Two more already.

448
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,038
began to give me ground.

449
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,208
I followed me close,
came in, foot and hand,

450
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,378
and with a thought,
seven of the 11 I paid.

451
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,380
(murmuring) O monstrous!
Eleven buckram men grown out of two.

452
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,760
But as the devil would have it,
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green

453
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,638
came at me back and let drive at me.

454
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,724
For it was so dark, Hal,
I couldst not see the hand.

455
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,937
These lies are like their father
that begets them.

456
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,274
Why, thou clay-brained guts,
thou knotty-pated fool,

457
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,818
thou whoreson obscene,
greasy tallow-catch!

458
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,071
Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?

459
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,782
Why, how couldst thou know
these men in Kendal green

460
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:17,077
when it was so dark
thou couldst not see thy hand?

461
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,913
Come, tell us your reason!
What sayest thou to this?

462
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,498
Come, your reason, Jack. Your reason.

463
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,083
Upon compulsion?

464
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,378
Zounds, and I were at the strappado
or all the racks of the world,

465
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,963
I would not tell you on compulsion.

466
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,340
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin!

467
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,760
This sanguine coward,
this horseback-breaker,

468
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,428
this huge hill of flesh ‒

469
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,555
'Sblood, you starveling,

470
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:41,643
you eel-skin, you dried neat's tongue,
you stockfish!

471
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,312
O for breath to utter what is like to thee!

472
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,691
You tailor's yardstick,
you sheath, you bowcase,

473
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,944
you vile standing tuck!

474
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,822
Well, breathe a while,
and then to it again.

475
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,782
Yet hear me speak but this.

476
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,576
We two saw you four set on four.

477
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,871
Mark now how a plain tale
shall put you down.

478
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,916
And, Falstaff, you carried yourself away

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,795
as nimbly, with as quick dexterity
and roared for mercy,

480
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,673
and still run and roared
as ever I heard bullcalf.

481
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,676
What a slave to hack thy sword
and say it was in fight.

482
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,637
What trick, what device,
what starting hole canst thou now find out

483
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,639
to hide thee from this open
and apparent shame?

484
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,434
Come, Jack. Let's hear.
What trick hast thou now?

485
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,189
By the Lord, lads,
I know you as well as he that made you.

486
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,859
- (both laughing)
- Was it for me to kill the heir apparent?

487
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,861
Should I turn upon the true prince?

488
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:36,948
Thou knowest I'm as valiant as Hercules,
but beware instinct.

489
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:41,202
The lion will not touch the true prince.
I was now a coward upon instinct.

490
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,122
By the Lord, lads,
I'm glad you have the money.

491
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,999
HOSTESS: My lord the prince!

492
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:49,836
There's a nobleman of the court at the door.
He would speak with you!

493
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,173
- How now, my lady hostess?
- He says he comes from your father.

494
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:57,177
Give him as much as will make him a royal man
and send him back again to my mother.

495
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,554
- (laughs)
- What manner of man is he?

496
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,181
(laughs) An old man.

497
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,017
What does gravity out of his bed at midnight?

498
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,894
- Shall I give him his answer?
- Prithee do, Ned.

499
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,355
Clap to the doors.
Watch tonight, pray tomorrow.

500
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,191
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold!

501
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:15,028
What, shall we be merry?
Shall we have a play extempore?

502
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,446
A play?

503
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,407
Thou will be horribly cheered when
thou com'st to thy father in the morning.

504
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,326
And thou lovest me, practice an answer.

505
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,244
Do thou stand for my father?

506
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,372
(chuckles) Gents.

507
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:29,209
This chair shall be me state,
this cushion my crown.

508
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,294
(laughing)

509
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,055
(laughing continues)

510
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,610
Here was Sir Thomas Bracy from your father.
There's villainous news abroad.

511
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,946
- That same mad fellow of the North ‒
- Percy?

512
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,907
He that kills me some six or seven dozen
of Scots at a breakfast,

513
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,411
washes his hands and says to his wife,
"Fie upon this quiet life. I want work!"

514
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,746
Hal, could the world pick you out
such an enemy again

515
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,748
as that fiend Percy,
the Hotspur of the North?

516
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,251
Does not thy blood thrill of it?
Art not thou horrible afeared?

517
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:14,045
Not a whit, i'faith.
I lack some of thy instinct.

518
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,090
(laughing continues)

519
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,759
Give me a cup of sack
to make the eyes look red

520
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,971
that it may be thought I have wept,
for I must speak in a passion.

521
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:25,432
- (laughing continues)
- (dogs barking)

522
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,024
(grunting)

523
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,118
Harry!

524
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:51,124
I do not only marvel
where thou spendest thy time,

525
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,460
but also how thou art accompanied.

526
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:58,673
(laughing) He doth it just like one
of these harlotry players, as ever I see!

527
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,843
Peace, good pint pot.
Peace, good tickle-brain.

528
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,846
That thou art my son
I have partly thy mother's word,

529
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,598
partly mine own opinion,

530
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,808
but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye

531
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:13,062
and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip
that doth warrant me.

532
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,941
If then thou be a son to me,
here lies the point!

533
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,486
Why, being son to me,
art thou so pointed at?

534
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,822
There is a thing, Harry, which thou
hast heard of by the name of pitch.

535
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,950
Pitch doth defile.
So doth the company thou keepest.

536
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,535
(whimpers)

537
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:32,457
And yet there is a virtuous man
who I have often noted in thy company,

538
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,167
but I know not his name.

539
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,212
What manner of man,
and it like Your Majesty?

540
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:40,715
A goodly, portly man, i'faith,
and a corpulent,

541
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,802
of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye
and a most noble carriage.

542
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,846
And, as I think, his age some 50 ‒

543
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,140
- (Hal hoots)
- Or by'r lady, inclining to threescore.

544
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,851
And now I remember me, his name ‒

545
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,353
Falstaff!

546
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,939
If that man should be lewdly given,
he deceiveth me,

547
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,608
for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks.

548
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,777
Him keep with!

549
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,363
The rest... banish.

550
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:06,407
Dost thou speak like a king?
Do thou stand for me?

551
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,285
- (laughter, applause)
<i>- I'll</i> play my father!

552
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,371
- Depose me?
- (laughs)

553
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,500
HAL: Here I am set.
FALSTAFF: And here I stand.

554
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,294
- Now, Harry, whence comes you?
- My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

555
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,881
(wails) The complaints
I hear of thee are grievous.

556
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,508
'Sblood, my lord, they are false!

557
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,718
(mutters) Nay, I'll tickle ye
for a young prince.

558
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:29,597
HAL: There is a devil haunts thee
in the likeness of an old, fat man.

559
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,725
A tun of man is thy companion.

560
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,728
Why dost thou converse
with that trunk of humors,

561
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,565
that bolting-hutch of beastliness,

562
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,650
that swollen parcel of dropsies,

563
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:44,153
that huge bombard of sack,
that stuffed cloakbag,

564
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,947
that roasted Manningtree ox,

565
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,659
that reverend Vice, that gray iniquity,
that father ruffian,

566
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,287
that vanity in years?

567
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:56,207
Wherein is he good,
but to taste sack and drink it?

568
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,711
Wherein neat and cleanly,
but to carve a capon and eat it?

569
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:03,506
Wherein cunning, but in craft?
Wherein crafty, but in villainy?

570
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,758
Wherein villainous, but in all things?

571
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,927
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?

572
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,638
(laughing continues)

573
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,682
I would Your Grace would take me with you.

574
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,183
Who means Your Grace?

575
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:17,103
That villainous, abominable
misleader of youth!

576
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,938
- Falstaff!
- Falstaff!

577
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:22,358
That old, white-bearded Satan.

578
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,570
- My lord, the man I know.
- I know thou dost.

579
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:28,615
But to say I know more harm in him
than I know in myself

580
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,658
- (knocking)
- is to say more than I know.

581
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,952
That he is old, the more's the pity.

582
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,121
His white hairs do witness it.

583
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:40,043
But that he is, saving your reverence,
an old Satan, that I utterly deny!

584
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,794
(knocking continues)

585
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:45,965
If sack and sugar be a fault,
then God help the wicked!

586
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,426
If to be old and merry be a sin,

587
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,137
then many an old host that I know
is damned.

588
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,808
And if to be fat is to be hated,
then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved.

589
00:32:55,892 --> 00:33:00,355
No, my good lord, banish Peto,
banish Bardolph, banish Poins,

590
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,815
but for sweet Jack Falstaff,

591
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,026
kind Jack Falstaff,

592
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,028
true Jack Falstaff,

593
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,530
- valiant Jack Falstaff ‒
- (laughing)

594
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:13,242
and therefore more valiant being,
as he is, old Jack Falstaff,

595
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,370
banish not him thy Harry's company.

596
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,331
Banish not him thy Harry's company.

597
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:22,710
Banish plump Jack,
and banish all the world.

598
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,962
- (laughter, applause)
- I do!

599
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,591
I will.

600
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,678
- O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
- What's the matter?

601
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,680
The sheriff and all the watch
are at the door!

602
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,682
Play out the play. Play out the play!

603
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:39,060
I have much to say
on behalf of that Falstaff.

604
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,895
(women screaming)

605
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,124
(dogs barking)

606
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:15,054
Go hide thee, Jack. Now, my masters,
for a true face and a good conscience.

607
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,598
Both of which I have had,
but their date is out.

608
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,892
Therefore, I'll hide me.

609
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,985
- Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
- (clears throat)

610
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,570
Pardon me, my lord.

611
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,781
A hue and cry have followed
certain men into this house.

612
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,909
- What men?
- One of them is well known, my gracious lord.

613
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,747
- A gross, fat man.
- As fat as butter!

614
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,666
The man, I do assure you, is not here.

615
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:47,628
And so, let me entreat you leave the house.

616
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,006
I will, my lord.

617
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,551
(laughing)

618
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:54,927
(bells pealing)

619
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,431
There are two gentlemen
have in this robbery lost 300 marks.

620
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:01,517
If he have robbed these men,
he shall be answerable.

621
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,270
And so farewell.

622
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,230
Good night, my noble lord.

623
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,447
(dogs barking)

624
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,201
I'll to the court in the morning.
We must all to the walls.

625
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,455
Good night, my noble lord.

626
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,040
(groans)

627
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,502
I think it be good morrow, is it not?

628
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:31,130
Indeed, my lord. I think it be 2:00.

629
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,429
FALSTAFF:
We must all to the wars, eh, lad?

630
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:42,141
- Hostess, my breakfast!
- You owe me money, Sir John!

631
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,186
And money lent you, four and 20 pounds.

632
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,979
Oh, you thing.

633
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:50,650
What thing? I am no thing.
I am an honest man's wife.

634
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:53,778
And setting thy knighthood aside,
thou art a knave to call me so.

635
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,532
Setting thy womanhood aside,
thou art a beast to say otherwise.

636
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,867
- (laughing)
- Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

637
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,870
What beast? Why... an otter.

638
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:05,498
An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?

639
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:09,085
O, she's neither fish nor flesh.
A man knows not where to have her.

640
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,338
O, thou art an unjust man for saying so!

641
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,967
Thou or any man knows
where to have me, thou knave, thou!

642
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,053
Thou sayest true, Hostess,
and he slanders thee most grossly.

643
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:23,432
So he doth you, my lord,
and said you owed him a thousand pounds.

644
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:26,018
Jack, do I owe thee a thousand pounds?

645
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,938
A thousand pounds, Hal? A million.

646
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,023
Thy love is worth a million.

647
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,568
Thou owest me thy love.

648
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,194
(laughing)

649
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:39,031
Well, my sweet beef,
I must still be good angel to thee.

650
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,451
My lord, he called you a jack
and a sneak-cup

651
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:43,995
and said he would cudgel you.

652
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:47,415
- Darest thou be as good as thy word now?
- Well, Hal, as a man I dare.

653
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,208
But as a prince,

654
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,628
I fear thee as I fear
the roaring of a lion's whelp.

655
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,674
- And why not as the lion?
- The king himself is to be feared as the lion.

656
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,845
Dost though think that I'll fear thee
as I fear thy father?

657
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:06,559
The money shall be paid back again,
with advantage.

658
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:10,062
I like not that paying back.
'Tis a double labor.

659
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,690
Thou whoreson...

660
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:17,320
- little, tidy Bartholomew boar-pig.
- How now, Doll.

661
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,407
Come.

662
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,993
I'll be friends with thee, Jack.

663
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,120
Thou art going to the wars,

664
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,915
and whether I shall ever
see thee again or not,

665
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,958
there's nobody cares.

666
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:34,045
(hoofbeats)

667
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,007
(bell tolling)

668
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,929
Hal!

669
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,973
Farewell, blown Jack!

670
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,935
Farewell, All-hallown summer!

671
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:51,270
(bell continues tolling)

672
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:54,565
Percy, Northumberland,
the Archbishop's grace of York,

673
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,484
Douglas, Mortimer...

674
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,362
capitulate against us and are up.

675
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:03,282
But wherefore do I tell this news to thee.

676
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:08,454
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
base inclination and the start of spleen,

677
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,374
to fight against me under Percy's pay,

678
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,585
to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,

679
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:17,296
to show how much thou art degenerate.

680
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,855
Lords, give us leave.

681
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,568
The Prince of Wales and I
must have some needful conference alone.

682
00:38:57,086 --> 00:39:00,172
I know not whether God will have it so

683
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,800
that in his secret doom,

684
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:06,512
out of my blood he'll breed revengement

685
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:10,474
and a scourge for me
to punish my mistreadings.

686
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,270
Tell me else.

687
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:18,274
Could such inordinate and low desires,

688
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:22,611
such barren pleasures, rude society,

689
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:24,613
accompany the greatness of thy blood?

690
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:25,865
So please Your Majesty ‒

691
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,659
Had I so lavish of my presence been,

692
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:31,203
so stale and cheap to vulgar company,

693
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:35,291
opinion, that did help me to the crown,

694
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,877
had left me in reputeless banishment.

695
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,296
(bell tolling)

696
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:44,633
The skipping king, he ambled up and down,
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits

697
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:47,511
mingled his royalty with capering fools,

698
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,306
grew a companion to the common streets.

699
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,558
So when he had occasion to be seen,

700
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:56,562
he was but as the cuckoo is in June,
heard, not regarded ‒

701
00:39:56,645 --> 00:40:01,358
seen, but with such eyes
as sick and blunted with community,

702
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,320
afford no extraordinary gaze,

703
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,989
such as is bent on sunlike majesty.

704
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:12,161
And in that very line, Harry, stands thou.

705
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:15,581
For thou has lost thy princely privilege

706
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,084
with vile participation.

707
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:22,421
Not an eye but is aweary
of thy common sight,

708
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,590
save mine,

709
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,468
that hath desired to see thee more.

710
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,097
I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
be more myself.

711
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,142
Harry, for all the world
as thou art to this hour was Richard then,

712
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:38,270
when I from France
set foot in Ravenspurgh.

713
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:42,483
And even as I was then is Percy now.

714
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,444
Now, by my scepter and my soul to boot,

715
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:48,405
he hath more worthy interest
to the state than thou.

716
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,074
Do not think so!

717
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,703
You shall not find it so.

718
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,624
I will redeem all this on Percy's head

719
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:03,587
and, in the closing of some glorious day,
be bold to tell you that I am your son.

720
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,631
And that shall be the day,
whene'er it lights,

721
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:11,303
that this same child of honor and renown,
this gallant Hotspur, this all-praisèd knight,

722
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:14,807
and your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.

723
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,144
Then will I make this Northern youth
exchange his glorious deeds

724
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,146
for my indignities!

725
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,981
This in the name of God...

726
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,024
I promise here.

727
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,153
The Earl of Westmoreland sets forth today.

728
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:30,239
On Wednesday next, Harry,
you shall set forth.

729
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,408
Our hands are full of business.
Let's away.

730
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,494
(bells tolling)

731
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,255
(onlookers gasping)

732
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:50,676
(chattering, laughing)

733
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:53,929
Pish!

734
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,849
"Pish" for thee,
thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland.

735
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,350
We must to the wars together.

736
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:01,353
Why the devil should we keep knives
to cut one another's throats?

737
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:04,023
O viper vile, now Pistol's cock is up.

738
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,733
And flashing fire will follow.

739
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:09,653
Pistol, pay me the eight shillings
I won of you at betting.

740
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:12,615
- Base is the slave that pays.
- Shog off!

741
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:22,374
(excited shouting)

742
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:26,962
(cackling, chattering)

743
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:31,717
What's he that goes there?

744
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,054
- Falstaff, an't please Your Lordship.
- He that is in question for the robbery?

745
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,263
DOLL: Jack!

746
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,352
My Lord Chief Justice.

747
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:46,190
I heard say Your Lordship was sick.
I hope Your Lordship goes abroad by advice.

748
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:50,069
Your Lordship, while not
clean past his youth, has yet some...

749
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:54,740
smack of age in him,
some relish of the saltness of time.

750
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:59,912
I most humbly beseech Your Lordship
to have a reverent care of your health.

751
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,288
Ah, my Lord Westmoreland.

752
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:04,833
I heard say Your Lordship
had already been at Shrewsbury.

753
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:07,753
- 'Tis more than time I were there, and you too.
- What, the king encamped?

754
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,339
He is, Sir John.
I fear we should all stay too long.

755
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:15,177
Sir John, methinks your soldiers
are exceeding poor and bare.

756
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,471
No eye has seen such scarecrows.

757
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:21,016
FALSTAFF: If I'm not ashamed of me soldiers,
I'm a sous'd gurnet.

758
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,769
I've misused the king's purse damnably.

759
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,980
I pressed me none but good householders.

760
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:27,982
They've bought out their services,

761
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,776
and now me whole charge consists
of younger sons to younger brothers,

762
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,780
revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen,

763
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,783
the cankers of a calm world
and a long peace.

764
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:41,245
- We must away all night, Falstaff.
- The king, I can tell you, looks for us all.

765
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,414
- Goes the prince with you?
- The prince?

766
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,541
You follow him up and down
like his ill angel.

767
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:49,628
- Falstaff, you have misled the youthful prince.
- The young prince has misled me.

768
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:51,463
The truth is, you live in great infamy.

769
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:54,300
Your means are very slender,
and your waste is great.

770
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,635
I would it were otherwise.

771
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,596
I would my means were greater
and my waist slender.

772
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,350
There is not a white hair on your face
but should have his effect on gravity.

773
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:06,312
His effect on gravy, gravy, gravy.

774
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:10,524
My lords, you that are old consider not
the capacities of us that are young.

775
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:11,859
Falstaff!

776
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:14,778
You do measure the heat of our livers
with the bitterness of your galls.

777
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,989
Do you set down <i>your</i> name
in the scroll of youth?

778
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:19,450
You that are written down old
with all the characters of age?

779
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,119
Have you not a moist eye,
a dry hand, a yellow cheek?

780
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,620
- A white beard?
- A decreasing leg?

781
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,332
- An increasing belly?
- Is not your voice broken, your wind short?

782
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,958
- Your chin doubled?
- Your wit singled?

783
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:32,713
And every part about you blasted with antiquity?
And will you yet call yourself young?

784
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:36,925
My lord, I was born about 3:00 in the afternoon
with a white head and something a round belly.

785
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:40,262
My voice, I've lost it
with hallowing and singing of anthems.

786
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:43,599
Sir John, Sir John,
you loiter here too long,

787
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:46,769
being as we're to take
more soldiers in counties as we go.

788
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,937
On, Corporal Nym.

789
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,734
Well, be honest, be honest,
and God bless your expedition.

790
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,528
Could Your Grace lend me a thousand pound
to furnish me forth?

791
00:44:56,612 --> 00:45:00,032
Not a penny. Not a penny. Fare you well.

792
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,368
- My lord?
- Not a penny.

793
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:05,371
Bardolph, go thee before
and fetch me a bottle of sack.

794
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,790
Will you give me money, Captain?

795
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,877
Well, God send the prince
a better companion.

796
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,379
(Falstaff laughs)

797
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:16,048
God send the companion a better prince!

798
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:17,883
How now!

799
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:22,554
The Earl of Westmoreland, 7,000 strong,
is marching hitherwards. With him, Prince John.

800
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,264
No harm. What more?

801
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:26,475
Further, we have learned
the king himself in person is set forth.

802
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,061
He shall be welcome too.

803
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,604
Where is his son,

804
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,899
the nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,

805
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:37,069
and his comrades
that daffed the world aside and bid it pass?

806
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,779
All furnished, all in arms.

807
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:42,199
For God's sake, cousin,
stay till all come in.

808
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:45,953
O gentlemen, the time of life is short.

809
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,997
To spend that shortness basely
were too long

810
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,918
if life did ride upon a dial's point,
still ending at the arrival of an hour.

811
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,964
And if we live, we live to tread on kings.

812
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,426
If die,

813
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:03,929
brave death when princes die with us.

814
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,264
Justice Shallow?

815
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:09,184
I am Robert Shallow, sir,
a poor esquire of this county

816
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:11,645
and one of the king's
justices of the peace.

817
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,856
My captain commends him to you.

818
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,316
My captain, sir, Sir John Falstaff,

819
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,653
a tall gentleman, by heaven,
and a most gallant leader.

820
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:23,490
He greets me well, sir.
He greets me well, sir!

821
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:26,368
- Davy?
- He's come hither.

822
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:29,163
- (stammering)
- Let me see. Let me see. Where's the roll?

823
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,290
- The soldiers.
- Mmm!

824
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:35,711
Use these men well, Davy, for they
are arrant knaves and will backbite.

825
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:39,298
No worse than they are backbitten, sir,
for they have marvelous foul linen.

826
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,383
Oh, well conceited, Davy!

827
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,470
Look. Here comes Sir John.
About thy business, Davy.

828
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:46,138
Give me your good hand!

829
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:49,475
Give me Your Worship's good hand!

830
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,185
Welcome, good Sir John.

831
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:54,354
Good master Robert Shallow.
I'm glad to see you well.

832
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,857
'Fore God, you have here
a goodly dwelling and a rich, rich...

833
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,484
Oh, barren, barren, barren.

834
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,486
Nay, you shall see my orchard

835
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:04,990
where, in an arbor, we will eat
a last year's pippin of my own grafting.

836
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,658
With a dish of caraways!

837
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:12,414
Have you provided me here
with a half a dozen... sufficient... men?

838
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:13,999
We have! We have, sir.

839
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,792
Come, sir. Will you sit?

840
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:18,378
Let me see, let me see. Where's the roll?

841

842

Robert Shallow. (chuckles)

843
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,804
I remember him at Clement's Inn

844
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,808
like a man made after supper
of a cheese-paring.

845
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,728
When 'a was naked, he was,
for all the world, like a forked radish,

846
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,105
with a head fantastically
carved upon it with a knife.

847
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:41,318
Was the very genius of famine,
yet lecherous as a monkey.

848
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,280
And now is this vice's dagger
become a squire,

849
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,409
and has lands and beeves.

850
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:51,078
Hmm.

851
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:53,455
Well, I'll be acquainted with him.

852
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,582
I will use him well, Davy,

853
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:59,253
for a friend in the court
is better than a penny in the purse.

854
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,255
Let me see, let me see.

855
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:04,758
(stammering)
Let them appear as you call, cousin.

856
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:08,804
Master Surecard, as I think?

857
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,597
- Silence!

858
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:14,059
Oh, Sir John, it is my cousin Silence,
in commission with me.

866
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:34,746
And the very same day did I fight

867
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,584
with one Sampson Stockfish,
a fruiterer, behind Gray's Inn.

868
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,919
O Jesu, Jesu!

869
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:43,171

Master Silence.
Let me see your men, Master Silence.

Let them appear as you call, cousin.
Let them do so. Let them do so.

Things that are moldy lack use.

- Eh, Sir John?
- Prick him.

- You could have let me alone!
- O, prick him!

My old dame will be undone now for one
to do her husbandry and her drudgery.

O Lord sir, I'm a diseased man.

- What disease hast thou?
- A cold, sir.

00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:38,537
A cough, sir, which I caught
with ringing in the king's affairs

910

00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,964
Who hath it? He that died a-Wednesday.

1001
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,008
Doth he feel it? No.

1002
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:45,176
'Tis he insensible then? Yea, to the dead.

1003
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,179
But will it not live with the living? No.

1004
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:52,517
Why? Detraction will not suffer it.
Therefore, I'll none of it.

1005
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,438
Honor is a mere scutcheon.

1006
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,440
And so ends my catechism.

1007
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,866
HOTSPUR: Come, let me taste my horse,

1008
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:11,411
that is to bear me like a thunderbolt
against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.

1009
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:14,664
Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,

1010
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:16,624
meet and ne'er part

1011
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,793
till one drop down a corse.

1012
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,151
(armor crashing)

1013
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:55,622
(horse whinnies)

1014
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,554
(whinnying continues)

1015
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,146
(men shouting)

1016
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,942
MAN: St. George and England!

1017
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:26,152
(all shouting)

1018
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:50,885
(shouting continues)

1019
00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:10,738
- (groans)
- (gasps)

1020
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,746
(whinnying)

1021
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:21,124
Ride! (shouts)

1022
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:30,758
(whistles)

1023
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,429
(whistles)

1024
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,932
(ferocious shouting)

1025
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,799
(man shouts)

1026
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:14,302
(men shouting)

1027
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,278
(horse whinnies)

1028
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,827
(man screams)

1029
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,628
(man shouts)

1030
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,129
(groans)

1031
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,092
Mercy! Mercy!

1032
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:56,177
(ferocious shouting)

1033
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:03,810
(men shouting)

1034
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:05,353
(grunts)

1035
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,620
(all shouting)

1036
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:30,044
(whinnying)

1037
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:40,513
(shouting)

1038
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:44,225
(men roaring)

1039
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:06,998
(screaming)

1040
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,727
Aaah!

1041
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:46,788
(men roaring)

1042
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,897
(shouting)

1043
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:25,159
(roaring)

1044
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,915
What, stand'st thou idle here?

1045
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:32,583
Give me leave to breathe a while.

1046
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:35,420
Turk Gregory never did such deeds
as I have done this day.

1047
01:02:35,503 --> 01:02:38,089
I have paid Percy.
I have made him sure.

1048
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,383
He is indeed, and living to kill thee.

1049
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,760
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

1050
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,472
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.

1051
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:47,932
My name is Harry Percy.

1052
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,726
Two stars keep not their motion
in one sphere,

1053
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,814
nor can one England brook a double reign
of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

1054
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:58,609
Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come
to end the one of us.

1055
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:02,697
(whinnying)

1056
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,326
(swords clashing)

1057
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:28,806
To it! (laughs) To it!

1058
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:34,312
FALSTAFF:
Here's no boys' play, I warrant you.

1059
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:10,765
Oh, Harry,

1060
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,850
thou hast robbed me of my youth.

1061
01:04:13,935 --> 01:04:19,273
I better brook the loss of brittle life
than these proud titles thou hast won of me.

1062
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:22,902
They wound my thoughts worse
than thy sword my flesh.

1063
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:26,197
But thought's the slave of life,

1064
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,782
and life time's fool,

1065
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:32,286
and time, that makes survey
of all the world,

1066
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:33,871
must have a stop.

1067
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:36,499
O, I could prophesy,

1068
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:42,088
but that the earthy and cold hand
of death lies on my tongue.

1069
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:49,011
No, Percy, thou art dust and food for ‒

1070
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:59,063
For worms, brave Percy.

1071
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,984
Fare thee well, great heart.

1072
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:07,029
Ill-weaved ambition,
how much art thou shrunk.

1073
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:11,742
When that this body did contain a spirit,
a kingdom for it was too small a bound.

1074
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:15,580
But now two paces of the vilest earth
is room enough.

1075
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:22,128
This earth that bears thee dead
bears not alive so stout a gentleman.

1076
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:28,467
Adieu.

1077
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:37,810
What, old acquaintance!

1078
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,148
Could not all this flesh
keep in a little life?

1079
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:45,151
Poor Jack, farewell.

1080
01:05:46,152 --> 01:05:49,113
I could have better spared a better man.

1081
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:56,662
Emboweled will I see thee by and by.

1082
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:01,834
Emboweled?

1083
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:05,671
If thou embowel me today, I'll give you leave
to powder me and eat me tomorrow.

1084
01:06:05,755 --> 01:06:07,214
'Twas time to counterfeit.

1085
01:06:07,298 --> 01:06:10,968
The better part of valor is discretion,

1086
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:14,305
in the which part I have saved my life.

1087
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:18,225
Zounds, this gunpowder Percy.

1088
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:20,478
I'll swear I killed him.

1089
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:23,064
♪♪ (trumpets: fanfare)

1090
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:27,860
The trumpet sounds retreat!

1091
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:30,655
The day is ours!

1092
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:46,796
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.

1093
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:50,591
Ill-spirited Worcester,

1094
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:55,346
did we not send grace, pardon
and terms of love to all of you?

1095
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:57,515
What I have done my safety urged me to.

1096
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:59,517
Bear Worcester to the death.

1097
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:03,562
Other offenders we will pause upon.

1098
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:20,538
Come, brother,
let us to the highest of the field,

1099
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:23,541
to see what friends are living,
who are dead.

1100
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:29,213
There's your Percy. (exhales)

1101
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:32,174
If your father will do me any honor, so.

1102
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:34,719
If not, let him kill the next Percy himself.

1103
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:37,221
- HAL: Why, Percy I killed.
- Didst thou?

1104
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:39,432
And saw thee dead.

1105
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:43,310
Lord, Lord,
how this world is given to lying.

1106
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:48,023
I grant you I was down and out of breath,
and so was he.

1107
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:53,112
But we rose both at an instant and fought
a long hour by Shrewsbury clock.

1108
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,912
I look to be either earl or duke,
I assure you.

1109
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:33,611
- (man shouts)
- (men chattering)

1110
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:43,954
Rebellion in this land shall lose its sway,

1111
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,707
meeting the check of such another day.

1112
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:56,008
Falstaff, you are going with Prince John
of Lancaster against Northumberland.

1113
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:59,303
There is not a dangerous action
could peep out his head

1114
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:01,305
but I'm thrust upon it.

1115
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:05,184
Well, I cannot last ever, but it was always
the trick of our English nation,

1116
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:07,937
if they have a good thing,
to make it too common.

1117
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,148
Well, Falstaff, the king hath
severed you and Prince Harry.

1118
01:09:11,232 --> 01:09:15,361
Yes, I thank your pretty wit for it.
(chuckles)

1119
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:17,905
Prince John of Lancaster! Good faith.

1120
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:20,991
This same sober-blooded boy
doth not love me,

1121
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:23,744
nor a man cannot make him laugh.

1122
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:27,331
But that's no marvel. He drinks no wine.

1123
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:30,876
There's never any of these demure boys
come to any proof,

1124
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,130
for thin drink
doth so overcool their blood

1125
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:38,425
that they are generally fools and cowards,

1126
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:42,888
which some of us should be too,
but for inflammation.

1127
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:44,849
(laughing)

1128
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:49,061
A good sherris-sack
hath a two-fold operation in it.

1129
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:52,314
It ascends me into the brain
and dries me there

1130
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:56,193
all the foolish, dull and cruddy vapors
which environ it,

1131
01:09:56,277 --> 01:09:58,529
makes it apprehensive, quick,

1132
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:03,033
forgetive, full of nimble, fiery
and delectable shapes,

1133
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:06,036
which, delivered o'er to the voice,
the tongue, which is the birth,

1134
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,872
becomes excellent wit.

1135
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:13,210
The second property of your excellent
sherris is the warming of the blood.

1136
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:16,797
The sherris warms it
and makes it course from the inwards

1137
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:19,216
to the parts extreme.

1138
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,887
And hereof comes it
that Prince Harry is valiant,

1139
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,138
(cheering)

1140
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:28,225
for the cold blood
he did naturally inherit of his father,

1141
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:32,438
he hath, like lean, sterile, bare land,
manured, husbanded and tilled

1142
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:36,734
with excellent endeavor of drinking good
and good store of fertile sherris,

1143
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:40,279
that he is become very hot and valiant.

1144
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,948
If I had a thousand sons,

1145
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:45,701
the first humane principle
I would teach them would be this ‒

1146
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:50,247
to forswear thin potations
and to addict themselves...

1147
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:52,082
to sack!

1148
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:55,252
(men laughing)

1149
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:11,560
NARRATOR: <i>From the first,
King Henry's reign was troubled with rebellion.</i>

1150
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,688
<i>But in the year of our Lord, 1408,</i>

1151
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:17,524
<i>the last of his enemies
had been vanquished.</i>

1152
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,446
<i>The king held his Christmas
this year at London,</i>

1153
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:25,032
<i>being sore vexed with sickness.</i>

1154
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,620
Many good morrows to Your Majesty.

1155
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:32,373
- Is it good morrow, lords?
- 'Tis 1:00 and past.

1156
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:36,502
Why, then good morrow
to you all, my lords.

1157
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:38,128
The Prince of Wales.

1158
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:40,297
- My lord?
- Where is he?

1159
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:42,466
Is he not with his brother,
John of Lancaster?

1160
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:44,635
No, my good lord. He isn't present here.

1161
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:46,637
Please it Your Grace to go to bed.

1162
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,722
Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill,

1163
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:52,059
and these unseasoned hours perforce
must add unto your sickness.

1164
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,644
What would my lord and father?

1165
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:56,897
- Why art thou not at Windsor with the prince?
- He is not there today.

1166
01:11:56,981 --> 01:11:58,691
He dines in London.

1167
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:00,651
And how accompanied?
Canst thou tell me that?

1168
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:05,155
With Poins
and other his continual followers.

1169
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,409
Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds,

1170
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:13,580
and he, the noble image of my youth,
is overspread with them.

1171
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:18,127
Therefore, my grief stretches itself
beyond the hour of death.

1172
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,755
The blood weeps from my heart

1173
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:25,384
when I do shape, in forms imaginary,

1174
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:31,056
the unguided days and rotten times
that you shall look upon

1175
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,601
when I am sleeping with my ancestors.

1176
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:36,854
My gracious lord,
you look beyond him quite.

1177
01:12:37,855 --> 01:12:40,190
The Prince of Wales will,
in the perfectness of time,

1178
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:41,859
cast off his followers.

1179
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:45,696
'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave
her comb in the dead carrion.

1180

- (crown clatters)
- (chattering, murmuring)

1181
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:00,544
Be patient, lords!

1182
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:03,255
You do know these fits
are with His Highness very ordinary.

1183
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:06,550
No, no, he cannot long
hold out these pangs.

1184
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:10,179
The incessant care and labor of his mind

1185
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:13,557
hath wrought the mure
that should confine it in so thin

1186
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,893
that life looks through
and will break out.

1187
01:13:16,769 --> 01:13:18,270
The crown!

1188
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:22,691
Set me the crown upon my pillow here.

1189
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:41,919
Let there be no noise, my gentle friends,

1190
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:45,255
unless some dull and favorable hand

1191
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:48,467
will whisper music to my weary spirit.

1192
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,011
Call for the music in the other room.

1193
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:56,100
♪♪ (small band: ballad)

1194
01:13:58,018 --> 01:14:00,020
The people fear me,

1195
01:14:00,104 --> 01:14:03,774
for they do observe unfathered heirs
and loathly births of nature.

1196
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,236
The seasons change their manners,

1197
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:10,197
as the year had found some months asleep
and leaped them over.

1198
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,743
The river hath thrice flowed,
no ebb between,

1199
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:18,288
and the old folk,
time's doting chronicles,

1200
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:21,834
say it did so a little time before that
our great-grandsire, Edward,

1201
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,752
sicked and died.

1202
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:38,725
How many thousands of my poorest subjects
are at this hour asleep.

1203
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:43,230
O sleep, O gentle sleep,

1204
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:45,482
nature's soft nurse.

1205
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:50,529
How have I frighted thee that thou
no more would weigh mine eyelids down

1206
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:53,740
and steep my senses in forgetfulness?

1207
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:59,163
Why rather, sleep,
liest thou in smoky cribs,

1208
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:01,582
upon uneasy pallets stretching thee

1209
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:05,711
and hushed with buzzing night-flies
to thy slumber

1210
01:15:05,794 --> 01:15:09,464
than in the perfumed chambers
of the great,

1211
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:12,092
under the canopies of costly state

1212
01:15:12,176 --> 01:15:14,970
and lulled with sounds of sweetest melody?

1213
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:19,433
O thou dull god,

1214
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:22,686
why liest thou with the vile
in loathsome beds,

1215
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:27,316
and leav'st the kingly couch
a watchcase or a common larum bell?

1216
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:33,697
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
seal up the ship boy's eyes

1217
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:37,868
and rock his brain in cradle
of the rude imperious surge

1218
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,828
and in the visitation of the winds,

1219
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:44,499
which take the ruffian billows by the top,
curling their monstrous heads

1220
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:48,045
and hanging them with deafening clamor
in the slippery shrouds,

1221
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:51,048
that, with the hurly, death itself awakes?

1222
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:57,221
But thou, O partial sleep,

1223
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:02,267
give thy repose to the wet sea boy
in an hour so rude.

1224
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,939
And in the calmest
and most stillest night,

1225
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:11,526
with all appliances and means to boot,

1226
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,946
deny it to a king?

1227
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:19,743
Then, happy low,

1228
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,328
lie down.

1229
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:27,167
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

1230
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:30,337
Before God,

1231
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,382
I am exceeding weary.

1232
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,634
Is't come to that?

1233
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:39,888
I had thought weariness durst not have
attached itself to one of so high blood.

1234
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:41,431
Faith, it does me,

1235
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:45,185
though it discolors the complexion
of my greatness to acknowledge it.

1236
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:49,606
- God save Your Grace!
- Yours, most noble Bardolph.

1237
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,316
How doth thy master?

1238
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,443
In bodily health, sir.

1239
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,988
"John Falstaff, knight,

1240
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:58,573
to the son of the king,
nearest his father,

1241
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:01,118
Harry, Prince of Wales, greeting."

1242
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,619
(chuckling)

1243
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:04,788
"Be not too familiar with" ‒

1244
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:08,959
You allow this wen to be
as familiar with me as your dog.

1245
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:12,462
"Be not too familiar with Poins,
for he misuses thy favors so much

1246
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:15,132
that he swears thou art
to marry his sister."

1247
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:18,218
My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack
and make him eat it.

1248
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:20,721
"Repent at idle times as thou mayest,
and so, farewell.

1249
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:24,641
Thine, by yea and no, which is as much
as to say, as thou usest him,

1250
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:27,769
Jack Falstaff with my familiars,
John with my brothers and sisters

1251
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:29,604
and Sir John with all Europe."

1252
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:32,983
- Is he in London?
- Yes, sir. With Mistress Doll Tearsheet.

1253
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,652
Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?

1254
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:39,406
You, boy, and Bardolph,
no word to your master

1255
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,491
that I am yet come to town.

1256
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:43,160
There's for your silence.

1257
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:44,995
I have no tongue, sir.

1258
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:48,123
And for mine, sir, I will govern it.

1259
01:17:56,673 --> 01:18:01,720
Doth it now show very vilely in me
to desire small beer?

1260
01:18:01,803 --> 01:18:04,598
Tell me, how many
good young princes would do so,

1261
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:08,393
their fathers being so sick as yours
at this time is?

1262
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:12,022
What a disgrace is it to me
to remember thy name

1263
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,524
or to know thy face tomorrow.

1264
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:19,905
Do you use me thus, Ned?
Must I marry your sister?

1265
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:22,366
God send the wench no worse fortune.

1266
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:24,409
But I never said so.

1267
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,121
- Come, Ned.
- I am your shadow, my lord.

1268
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:30,791
I follow you.

1269
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,634
'Sblood.

1270
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:45,514
I'm as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

1271
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:48,475
Sir John, you are so fretful,
you cannot live long.

1272
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:52,229
Well, there it is.

1273
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:55,315
I'll tell you what I am about.

1274
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:57,067
Two yards, and more.

1275
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:00,821
Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about,

1276
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:02,948
but I am now about no waste.

1277
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:04,658
I'm about thrift.

1278
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:08,870
I must turn away some of my followers.

1279
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:10,455
There's no remedy.

1280
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:13,166
I will employ Bardolph.
He shall draw here for me.

1281
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,044
A tapster is a good trade.

1282
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,632
Lads, I am...

1283
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:25,554
almost out at heels.

1284
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:28,974
Hello, Doll.

1285
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:33,437
- Is that all the comfort you give me?
- (knocking)

1286
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,273
Who knocks so loud at door?

1287
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:39,943
- That muddy rascal.
- You make fat rascals, Doll.

1288
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:44,114
I make them?
Gluttony and diseases make them.

1289
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:47,117
If the cook help to make the gluttony,

1290
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,370
you help to make the diseases
we catch of you.

1291
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:52,789
- Hmm?
- Oh!

1292
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:56,710
We catch of you, for to serve bravely
is to come halting off, you know,

1293
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,171
to come off the breach
with his pike bent bravely,

1294
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,047
and to surgery bravely,

1295
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,799
to venture upon
the charged chambers bravely.

1296
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:06,219
Hang yourself, you muddy conger!
Hang yourself!

1297
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:08,680
You two never meet
but you fall to some discord.

1298
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:10,265
(groaning)

1299
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:14,352
You are both, in good truth,
as rheumatic as two dry toasts.

1300
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:16,730
(Doll retching)

1301
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:19,858
But, in faith, sweetheart,
you have drunk too much canaries.

1302
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:24,696
- How do you now?
- Better than I was.

1303
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:29,242
Oh, why, that's well said.
A good heart's better than gold.

1304
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:30,869
(Doll groaning)

1305
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:33,163
What the goodyear!

1306
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,208
One must bear, and that must be you.

1307
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:40,295
- Sir, it's Pistol. He'd speak with you.
- (shouts) Pistol?

1308
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:43,340
The foulest mouth rogue in England!

1309
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:45,967
Hang him, swaggering rascal!

1310
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:48,762
- Swagger?
- Empty the Jordan.

1311
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,931
If he swagger, let him not come here.

1312
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:53,934
- He's no swaggerer, hostess.
- A tame cheater, in faith.

1313
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:58,313
You may stroke him as gentle
as a puppy greyhound.

1314
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,816
- Pistol!
- God save you, Sir John!

1315
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,862
Pistol, I charge you with a cup of sack.
You discharge upon mine hostess.

1316
01:21:05,946 --> 01:21:09,407
I will discharge upon her,
Sir John, with two bullets.

1317
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:11,326
- (Falstaff laughing)
- (screaming)

1318
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:15,038
She's Pistol-proof, sir.
You shall hardly offend her.

1319
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:18,041
Then to you, Mistress Dorothy,
I will charge you.

1320
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:20,377
Charge me? You filthy bung!

1321
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,128
Get me my rapier, Bardolph.

1322
01:21:22,212 --> 01:21:25,549
I'll thrust my knife in your moldy chaps,
and you play the saucy cuttle with me.

1323
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:28,426
God let me not live,
but I'll bury your ruff for this.

1324
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,720
Pistol, I would not have you go off here.

1325
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,390
- HOSTESS: Not here, sweet captain.
- Captain?

1326
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:35,892
- Pray thee, go down, good captain.
- You, a captain?

1327
01:21:35,976 --> 01:21:39,145
For what? For tearing a poor whore's ruff
in a bawdy house?

1328
01:21:39,229 --> 01:21:44,109
(grunts) Shall hollow pampered jades
of Asia compare with Caesars

1329
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:48,572
and with cannibals and with Trojan Greeks?

1330
01:21:53,034 --> 01:21:56,246
- Come.
- (screams) Nay!

1331
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:57,998
Get here a judge!

1332
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:00,625
PISTOL: What! Shall we have incision?
Shall we imbrue?

1333
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:05,005
Why, then let grievous, ghastly, gaping
wounds untwine the Sisters Three!

And to think how many
of my old acquaintances are dead.

1509

Certain. 'Tis certain.

1511

Death, as the psalmist saith,
is certain to all.

God witness with me, when I found
no course of breath within Your Majesty,

1561

Thinking you dead,
I spake unto this crown as having sense,

1562
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:06,929
and thus upbraided it:

1563
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:11,892
"The care on thee depending
hath fed upon the body of my father,

1564
01:36:11,976 --> 01:36:15,604
therefore, thou best of gold
art worst of gold.
