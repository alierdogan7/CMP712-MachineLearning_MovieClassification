1
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,244
Sir, good afternoon

2
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,316
How's the situation over in
Phnom Penh?

3
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,021
A lot of personnel changes.

4
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:09,031
The situation can still be
considered stable.

5
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:28,949
Sir, you can't take my money

6
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,044
I know that is my fault

7
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:34,215
The money is very important
to me for saving a life.

8
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:36,748
Can you give it back to me?
Thank you.

9
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,228
What's up?

10
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:06,072
Cheung Chi-Mun
You're free to leave prison.

11
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:31,039
Mark

12
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,178
I was supposed to pick you
up at the airport....

13
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,013
lnstead you picked me up at
prison

14
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:53,321
Where's Dad?

15
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:55,555
Uncle's waiting for you at
the drug store.

16
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:58,258
Yesterday I almost lost my
life at the airport.

17
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,096
If I hadn't paid them off,

18
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,261
we'd be meeting inside the
prison.

19
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,430
When those customs officers
see money,

20
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:06,166
their eyes light up like car
headlights.

21
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:09,278
Mark, you went through a lot
of trouble for me.

22
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:11,074
Pedicab

23
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,181
It's a good thing they like
money.

24
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:15,079
Otherwise you'd still be
rotting in jail.

25
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:17,143
Bye-bye

26
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
''Bye-bye''

27
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:28,126
Is that ''goodbye'' in
Vietnamese?

28
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:30,724
They don't know what you're
saying

29
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,432
In Hong Kong, what do you
hear about the war?

30
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,006
We've got a piece of news
black-out,don't know a thing

31
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:40,632
The radio and newspapers
all report....

32
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:42,372
...the Viet Cong are very
close to the city.

33
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:44,073
The situation is terrible.

34
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,485
It's good you've come back.
Help me persuade Dad.

35
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,920
He's not convinced that the
situation is bad.

36
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:55,014
You said there's a news
black-out here.

37
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:57,151
How can anybody know what's
going on?

38
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:59,593
The city looks peaceful
enough.

39
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,654
Mun, didn't you apply for
Uncle's visa?

40
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:04,923
The line outside immigration
goes on forever.

41
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,958
You get nowhere without
bribes.

42
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,028
The Chinese have been here
for decades.

43
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,369
Asking them to shut down
their businesses...

44
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:12,465
...is worse than killing
them.

45
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,442
Why do you think I worked
in the black market?

46
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:15,774
Only to get him a passport.

47
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,780
And it all came to nothing.

48
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:21,110
Which one of us gets them?

49
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:25,620
They're yours

50
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:27,955
Hello

51
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:29,614
How are you?

52
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:57,977
War mongers, go home

53
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,760
Let's make a fast turn

54
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:52,099
The pedicab's broken down.
- Get off and push

55
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:54,326
Great

56
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,201
Chicken buttocks

57
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:03,412
Pat, get the soy sauce.

58
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:23,358
Uncle, here's some wine.

59
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,559
I put Chinese wine in a
foreign brandy bottle.

60
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,259
Almost got confiscated in
customs.

61
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:29,669
Drink up so it won't go to
waste. - Yeah

62
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:32,639
You're clever to put the
wine in a brandy bottle.

63
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,105
Mainland Chinese products
aren't allowed in.

64
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:39,045
You've to remove the label
or change the bottle.

65
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,581
Did you go to Mainland China
to see your Dad?

66
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:44,111
How can I go there now?

67
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:46,587
It's chaos there with the
Cultural Revolution.

68
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,318
Even if I went, I wouldn't
know how to find him.

69
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:50,791
We've been separated for
over ten years.

70
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:54,489
Uncle, I bought this at the
China Products Store.

71
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:56,264
This is good wine

72
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:57,664
Delicious

73
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,265
Pat

74
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:04,302
Not fish sauce. I hate fish
sauce.

75
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,332
I want soy sauce

76
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,708
The black stuff

77
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:12,009
Get going

78
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,379
Soy sauce.

79
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:15,580
Who's that kid?

80
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:19,213
At New Years when the Viet
Cong entered Hue,

81
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,950
he was separated from his
parents.

82
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,357
I took pity on him and took
him in.

83
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,418
When I asked him his name,

84
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:27,952
he just stammered.

85
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:29,988
I didn't understand what
he said.

86
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,364
So I call him Pat.

87
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,270
Dad

88
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:39,165
What was Dad gabbing about?

89
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:27,051
We need money to get Dad
out of here.

90
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:29,023
I was already arrested by
them once.

91
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:31,049
A second time would be very
dangerous.

92
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:33,755
But there's a war going on.

93
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:35,787
It's dangerous no matter
what you do.

94
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,129
Anyway, nothing ventured
nothing gained.

95
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,038
Who are you looking for?

96
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:51,171
My ex-boss went to Thailand.

97
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,807
When I was in prison, Chung
told me of new buyer.

98
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,181
Miss Chow Ying-Kit.

99
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,181
I'm familiar with Saigon.

100
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,216
May be I'll recognise this
Chow.

101
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:12,826
Which one of us gets her?

102
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:20,600
She's mine

103
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,980
She's responding

104
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,619
Not the reaction we hoped
for

105
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,900
Are you Cheung Chi-Mun?

106
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:47,334
Hello, Mr. Chow

107
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:48,336
Hello.

108
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,567
This is my cousin Mark.

109
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,041
Let's go over there.

110
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,053
Mr. Cheung, you've just
gotten out of prison.

111
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:14,824
You're fast at making
connections.

112
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,799
What's your connection with
Bong?

113
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,164
Chung introduced me.

114
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,930
Chung?
- Yes.

115
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,336
I can tell the soldiers
outside...

116
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:24,896
...to use you for target
practice

117
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,135
What's the matter?

118
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,138
They're looking for Chow
Ying-Kit.

119
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:31,908
These two guys are friends
of mine.

120
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,881
Let me talk to them.

121
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,850
It's Ok.

122
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:38,780
Leave

123
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,285
Does she know us?

124
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,262
This is your territory. Why
ask me?

125
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,788
You're looking for Chow Ying
Kit?

126
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,666
He's ''10th Uncle'', the boss
here.

127
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:55,897
I'm Chow Ying-Kit.

128
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,006
Bong is a complicated
fellow.

129
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,981
He doesn't need you for
the black market.

130
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,711
There's lots of other ways
to make money.

131
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,447
Why choose this path?

132
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,011
You've been in prison.

133
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:16,513
If Bong cheats you...
...and you're arrested again

134
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,720
You'll never see HK again.

135
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,818
I've done business with
Bong twice.

136
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:23,161
He could have betrayed me
long ago.

137
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,632
You say that Bong's
complicated.

138
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,794
In this business, aren't
we all?

139
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:28,930
Mr. Cheung.

140
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,598
You're an outsider.

141
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:31,765
We're all Chinese.

142
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,365
A piece of advice for you.

143
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,436
Don't get involved in things
you can't control.

144
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,537
Good-bye.

145
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,809
Miss Chow.

146
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:42,616
Miss Chow.

147
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:46,747
Please don't blame us for
our ignorance.

148
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,518
He's an overseas Chinese.

149
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:50,991
We're doing this for my
uncle.

150
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,857
You know now these old
Chinese are.

151
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,090
They struggle all their
lives to get ahead

152
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,791
lf I can't get them out of
here,

153
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,629
and they stay, what is it
all for?

154
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,932
So I've come back to take
them to Hong Kong.

155
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:04,303
I don't want to gamble like
this.

156
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,934
You've seen this country.
Everyone gambles.

157
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,035
Including this war.

158
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:12,104
Nobody knows what tomorrow
will bring

159
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:14,811
Our gambling chips...

160
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,978
...are being played by
others.

161
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,955
We have no control over who
wins or loses.

162
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,484
Not even a choice over
whether to play or not.

163
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:29,987
If this were our own place,
we wouldn't need to leave.

164
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:32,000
Everyone here tonight is
escaping.

165
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,468
To leave or to stay,

166
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,801
it's all a gamble.

167
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,239
You're very capable.

168
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,971
If you don't serve as the
casino's banker,

169
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:45,447
we won't even have a chance
to gamble.

170
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:48,109
You said that all of us are
Chinese.

171
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,811
Try to see it from our
perspective.

172
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:53,151
Tell us what to do.

173
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:01,320
According to my usual
practice,

174
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:08,493
I never conduct business
here.

175
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,437
As to the time and place,

176
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:13,032
I'll have someone contact
you.

177
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:20,912
What are you doing?

178
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:22,439
I'll have someone contact
you.

179
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,042
Don't bother. I'll answer it

180
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,487
It's just the phone Why so
anxious?

181
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,490
It's Mun's girlfriend.

182
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:34,087
Asking him to have a last
fling.

183
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,189
Then what are you so nervous
about?

184
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,596
Me?

185
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,736
Waiting for your girlfriend,
too?

186
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,635
Mun and I met that girl at
the same time.

187
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:45,162
So part of the fling should
be mine.

188
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,971
I'm going over now for my
phone fling.

189
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:53,240
His Dad and I used to be
just like that, too.

190
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:57,548
It's hard to escape the
tender trap

191
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,816
What are you laughing at?

192
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:03,017
You don't even know what
I'm talking about

193
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,185
Take your dinner

194
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:10,054
Let me have the phone
- Come on

195
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,699
Hello, Miss Chow.

196
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,258
Hello?

197
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,201
Hello? Hello?

198
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,205
Why isn't she saying
anything?

199
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,675
She already hung up.
- Playing tricks on me

200
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,110
What's up?

201
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:26,444
Tonight at 8:30 at the
Alhambra Theatre.

202
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:51,802
Miss Chow, it's getting late
still want to wait?

203
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:13,224
This car's from the Foreign
Ministry.

204
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:15,492
They wouldn't dare to do
anything rash.

205
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,095
Don't try anything

206
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,766
We have a permit from the
Foreign Ministry.

207
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:40,714
Bong, Bong. - You haven't
stopped the car yet

208
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,690
Mum Mum

209
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,622
Hello

210
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,921
We've been waiting for you
a long time.

211
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,894
This is Hung.

212
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:04,672
Please excuse us for being
late, Miss Chow.

213
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,150
Miss Chow Ying-kit is the
buyer I told you about

214
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:20,991
This is my cousin, Mark.

215
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:22,858
Miss Chow, this is Bong.

216
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:25,389
Pleased to meet you.

217
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:35,072
Let me help you with this.

218
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:42,644
Move out of the way Over
there

219
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,551
You, too. Hurry up

220
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:55,625
Have a smoke.

221
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:57,632
Let them conduct a thorough
search.

222
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,597
Have some gum and then
search him.

223
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:28,243
Come on

224
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:30,148
Hurry up

225
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:35,582
Go where?

226
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:37,785
Upstairs.

227
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,341
Make a thorough search.

228
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:01,713
Search upstairs.

229
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:29,639
Mark, stay here. Il'll stop
Bong from getting away.

230
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,615
Don't go there. It's too
dangerous.

231
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,181
The army is on its way up.

232
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:46,217
Sooner or later we'll have
to make our escape.

233
00:26:56,972 --> 00:27:00,772
Cover me. I'll get the gold
back.

234
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:08,643
No bullets left

235
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:20,282
Take a jump, Mun

236
00:28:21,156 --> 00:28:23,716
Forget about the money.
Let's get out of here.

237
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:25,988
What about Miss Chow?
How's Miss Chow?

238
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:38,795
Over there

239
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,149
Mark

240
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,553
Mark Mark

241
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,560
Mark, are you Ok?

242
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:30,139
Very proud of yourself,
aren't you?

243
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,519
Did you see Bong's
expression?

244
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:14,346
You certainly earned your
commission.

245
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,755
Otherwise, why go to so much
trouble?

246
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:20,784
I worship you more than any
other woman on earth

247
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:13,767
Miss Chow,

248
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:17,464
Let me return this to you.

249
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:23,066
I hope I didn't get your
lipstick dirty.

250
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:25,312
I forgot all about it

251
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:28,405
I'd never thought you'd take
such good care of it

252
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:33,377
Old songs always make for
great listening.

253
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:36,390
Proof that old things are
better than new ones.

254
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:40,622
Do you agree with me?

255
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,063
''10th Uncle''

256
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,122
What are you trying to say?

257
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,191
I think you still remember
Mr. Ho.

258
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,169
He made you what you are
today.

259
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:54,402
Could you ever forget him?

260
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:58,974
Ho disappeared in Holland
3 years ago.

261
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:01,709
I miss him very much.

262
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:03,944
If it weren't for him,

263
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:07,682
l wouldn't have the success
l have today.

264
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:11,385
You don't have to remind me.

265
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:34,044
What is Ho's relationship
to you?

266
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:36,250
More than ten years ago,

267
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:39,082
when Ho was just starting
out,

268
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,578
he came into the bar one
night.

269
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:44,853
l was singing in the bar
at the time.

270
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,257
l thought...

271
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,125
just one man against ten...

272
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,892
l acted on impulse and
grabbed a knife.

273
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:53,457
l saved his life.

274
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:54,968
Afterwards,

275
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:57,994
l travelled the world with
him.

276
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,473
We were together a long time

277
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:02,533
He was not only my lover,

278
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:05,671
but also my confidante.

279
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:08,915
Now,

280
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,111
his enemies are out to kill
him,

281
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:15,020
so he's disappeared for 3
years.

282
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:19,390
Do you know what it feels
like...

283
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,759
...too lose someone dear?

284
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,398
The dearest person to me is
my father.

285
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:29,028
l don't know what's happened
to him.

286
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,665
Nobody knows if he's alive
or dead.

287
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:37,006
All these years, everything
l've done....

288
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:38,875
has been for my uncle and
my cousin Mun.

289
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:41,006
l don't dare have any hopes
for myself.

290
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:42,879
l only know....

291
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,509
the bigger the hopes,

292
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:47,885
the greater the
disappointment.

293
00:37:52,794 --> 00:37:55,319
Actually, hopes are just
a big gamble.

294
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:57,456
lf you lose, it's very
painful.

295
00:37:57,498 --> 00:38:00,092
l'd rather not even try.

296
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,806
Before, when l was poor...

297
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:12,176
l just wanted to make it
big.

298
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:14,545
Now,

299
00:38:14,582 --> 00:38:17,380
l have money, position,

300
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:21,445
everything but a close
friend.

301
00:38:22,623 --> 00:38:26,889
lt's hard to make it to the
top, but impossible to

302
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:28,225
go back.

303
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:31,527
There are many things, l can
look back & observe,

304
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:33,830
but l can't go back.

305
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:36,036
Since you don't expect too
much,

306
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,630
you should be happier than
me.

307
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:42,603
lt's been a long time since
l talked so much

308
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:45,043
Really?
- Yes

309
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,717
Later on, please don't cry

310
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,124
What's the use of going back

311
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:09,898
ln 1997 Hong Kong will be
handed over to China.

312
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:12,667
We'll just have to come back
here.

313
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:16,143
Vietnam has been at war for
many years.

314
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:18,236
The situation here is no
worse than before.

315
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:21,509
Uncle, it's 1974. 23 years
until 1997.

316
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:22,641
That's a long time.

317
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,878
Might as well go back for
a look.

318
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:26,146
Yeah

319
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,348
Let's go.

320
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,053
lt's all a matter of fate.

321
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:35,392
Everthing is pre-ordained.

322
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:51,541
Mark, the taxi's waiting.

323
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,983
We're carrying a lot of cash
Will customs give us trouble

324
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:00,510
Don't worry. Kit knows those
guys.

325
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:03,580
She'll arrange matters for
us at the airport.

326
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:08,927
The signboard has been here
for over 20 years.

327
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:11,761
l can't bear to leave it
behind.

328
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,196
Pat

329
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:27,710
Be careful

330
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,215
Pat

331
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:31,114
The camera

332
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,311
Turn off the lights

333
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:41,593
l almost forgot we weren't
coming back

334
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:49,602
Uncle, l'll pack it for you.

335
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:54,637
This money for you. Don't
waste it.

336
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:57,744
l'll come back when things
have settled down.

337
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:00,679
Take good care of your
your health.

338
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:05,550
Don't forget to close the
windows at night.

339
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:09,716
Wipe away the dust when you
have time.

340
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:15,061
lt's up to you to take care
of this big place.

341
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:20,695
On clear days, take the
medicine out to dry.

342
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,495
We're running out of time,
Dad. Hurry up.

343
00:41:23,537 --> 00:41:27,098
The taxi meter is running.
Let the medicine get mouldy.

344
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:28,573
Why are you so reluctant to
leave this shop?

345
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:30,133
l'll get you a new one in
Hong Kong.

346
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,077
Does he even understand what
you're saying?

347
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:36,550
He understands more than you
l looked at the sign,

348
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,552
and he knew to take it down.

349
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,247
Why didn't you take it down?

350
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:41,686
So what if he took it down.

351
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:43,690
Now it's up to me to get it
to the airport.

352
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:46,022
Let's go The plane won't
wait for us.

353
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,688
Why are you so impatient?
Go by yourself.

354
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:50,526
l'll tell Pat to hang it
back up.

355
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:51,496
l'm not going.

356
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:53,466
l went to a lot of trouble
to get your exit permit

357
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,162
Don't make all of us miss

Hurry up and get on the
plane

445
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,655
Due to the Watergate
incident, the U.S. Congress

446
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,056
has requested President
Nixon's resignation.

447
00:51:12,092 --> 00:51:14,322
According to observers,
after Nixon resigns,

448
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,795
the situation in Vietnam
will be worsen.

449
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,354
But the South Vietnamese
government emphasizes

450
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:20,366
they have confidence in
current situation.

451
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,460
And will continue their
liberal economic policies.

452
00:51:23,503 --> 00:51:25,403
Next Monday, the President
of Vietnam

453
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:27,634
will convene an emergency
meeting...

454
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:29,665
...to deal fairly and
impartially...

455
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,678
...with the serious problem
of corruption.

456
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:33,270
He pledges to the National
Council...

457
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:34,575
...that the government will
be cleaned up.

458
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:37,508
Get out of the way

459
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:39,151
Stand to the side

460
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:40,953
Reuters reports a fierce
aerial attack...

461
00:51:40,988 --> 00:51:42,785
...on South Vietnam last
Sunday.

462
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:45,018
Casualty figures are still
unavailable.

463
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:47,356
Due to the current
instability in Vietnam,

464
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:49,862
many Vietnamese boat people
have arrived...

465
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:52,228
in Hong Kong during the past
few days.

466
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:53,927
The Hong Kong government
and the UN....

467
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:57,061
...are conducting
discussions over ways...

468
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:59,334
...to humanely solve the
refugee problems.

469
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:01,565
l told you they were
finished

470
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:03,701
lt's a good thing we left
when we did

471
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:07,871
So what? We still lost our
home

472
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:23,788
Cousin Mark, if there's
anything l've done wrongly,

473
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,127
please forgive me

474
00:52:25,265 --> 00:52:28,723
Don't be silly l got mad
just now. Don't bother me.

475
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:32,837
You'll be getting hungry as
you don't take dinner.

476
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:35,066
Have a bowl of soup, please.

477
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:36,699
Thank you.

478
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:57,763
Vietnam is in chaos.
l wonder how Kit is?

479
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,122
l hope she's OK.

480
00:53:01,635 --> 00:53:04,297
We still haven't had any
news about her.

481
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:08,606
Cousin Mark

482
00:53:08,642 --> 00:53:10,974
There's a car outside with
a flat tire.

483
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:12,911
You want to repair it?

484
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:15,611

Mun

491
00:54:24,618 --> 00:54:26,347
What's the matter? Can't
fix it?

492
00:54:26,386 --> 00:54:27,751
Tell him to leave it here.

493
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:29,278

494
00:54:30,357 --> 00:54:31,289

Thanks.

541
00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:10,041
Drink Drink

542
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:11,276
Find out what Mr. Cheung
desires,

543
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:14,219
and put it on my company's
bill.

544
00:57:14,354 --> 00:57:15,878
Thanks a lot.

545
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,717
You can treat me whenever
l come here.

546
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:20,282
Have a good time. l'm
leaving now.

547
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:24,358
Kit, l'll take you home.

548
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,192
Oh, so Mr. Cheung is a
friend of Miss Chow's.

549
00:57:31,905 --> 00:57:34,100
Miss Chow.

550
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,325
Miss Chow?
- ln the car.

551
00:57:59,633 --> 00:58:00,793
Where?

552
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:01,865
Come on

553
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:03,902
Kit

554
00:58:05,238 --> 00:58:08,366
See what you've done Go and
talk to her

555
00:58:11,077 --> 00:58:12,738
Kit

556
00:58:12,946 --> 00:58:14,072
Kit

557
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:27,258
She threw up all over the
car. Go and talk to her.

558
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:31,196
Kit

559
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,267
You take her home.

560
00:58:35,435 --> 00:58:36,697
Hey

561
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:39,097
What's the matter?

562
00:58:39,205 --> 00:58:41,230
Why do you want to go off
by yourself?

563
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:44,377
Why can't we three go
together?

564
00:58:44,811 --> 00:58:48,611
There are a lot of things
3 can't do together.

565
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:51,640
Don't you and Kit involve
me in your affairs.

566
00:58:51,685 --> 00:58:53,243
l'm giving you the chance
to take her back home.

567
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:55,117
You said that whoever she
chooses,

568
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:56,850
there will be no grudges
between us.

569
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,117
What do you mean by that?

570
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:01,957
You're giving me a chance
to be with Kit, right?

571
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:06,661
Mun, l know how you feel
about Kit.

572
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,725
Don't worry, l'll never say
you're pretty.

573
00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:11,032
Pursue her whole-heartedly.

574
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:12,504
Don't disappoint Uncle.

575
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:14,370
Two cousins after the same
girl....

576
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:17,672
but only one can be her
bridegroom.

577
00:59:18,078 --> 00:59:19,568
Mark

578
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,248
Kit, l'm Mun.

579
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:29,949
l'm not Mark.

580
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:37,289
l know. Take me home.

581
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:54,135
Mr. Cheung. Your car is over
there. Your keys.

582
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,239
l'm not leaving yet.

583
01:00:53,873 --> 01:00:57,138
The Yanks and Vietnamese are
having peace talks.

584
01:00:57,177 --> 01:00:58,769
There won't be any more
problems.

585
01:00:58,812 --> 01:01:00,746
Miss Chow wanted us to move
back to Hong Kong.

586
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,839
That was an unwise move.

587
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,440
Hong Kong is more peaceful.

588
01:01:04,484 --> 01:01:06,543
So we're refugees now

589
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:10,385
Ho Cheung Ching

590
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:14,823
Kit, they said you were
drunk.

591
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:17,329
So l didn't want to wake
you up.

592
01:01:17,897 --> 01:01:20,422
l love the way you
redecorated my place.

593
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:23,993
l almost didn't recognise
my old office.

594
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:29,864
Fortunately, you haven't
changed.

595
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:35,208
Just a bit thinner.

596
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,483
You surely have so many
problems you can't solve.

597
01:01:39,586 --> 01:01:41,747
l've come back to help you.

598
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:56,865
Uncle Let me do that.

599
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,404
We're having our grand
opening. Happy?

600
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:00,564
Of course l'm happy.

601
01:02:06,946 --> 01:02:10,677
l've had a lot of time to
think these 3 years.

602
01:02:10,717 --> 01:02:12,241
All day l'd ask myself...

603
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:16,221
how could my enemies find
out where l was in Holland?

604
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:21,854
My betrayer must be a
trusted friend.

605
01:02:22,061 --> 01:02:24,552
Grand opening Here's a
lucky packet

606
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:25,664
Thanks, uncle

607
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:28,232
''10 Uncle'', tell everybody,

608
01:02:28,368 --> 01:02:30,893
how Cheng knew my every
movement.

609
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:34,832
Mr. Ho, outsiders see how
close we are,

610
01:02:35,008 --> 01:02:36,566
and try to drive a wedge
between us.

611
01:02:36,676 --> 01:02:37,904
lf l did such a despicable
thing.

612
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:39,740
Would l have the guts to
meet you face to face?

613
01:02:39,879 --> 01:02:42,245
Don't you worry about your
kids....

614
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:43,576
...in the United States?

615
01:02:43,783 --> 01:02:46,377
Tell everyone how there
could be...

616
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:50,387
...so many killers waiting
for me at that Dutch bank?

617
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:54,524
How did your Swiss bank
account...

618
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,653
...become US$2 million
richer?

619
01:02:58,298 --> 01:03:01,324
Mr. Ho, l've let you down.
l was wrong.

620
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:04,995
l won't make it hard on
your family.

621
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:08,735
l'll let you do the
honorable thing.

622
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:33,928
Get out of my way

623
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,195
l'll shoot anyone who tries
something

624
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:40,271
Mr. Ho, let me get out of
this alive.

625
01:03:40,306 --> 01:03:42,365
Don't force me, Mr. Ho.

626
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:45,969
You've the guts to betray
me, why not shoot me?

627
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:49,038
Afraid you can't shoot?

628
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,120
They're blank

629
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:58,484
Miss Chow is busy?

630
01:03:58,758 --> 01:04:01,022
This lucky packet is for you

631
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:13,738
Mr. Ho, let me go. l didn't
want this to happen.

632
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:16,434
l was forced into it by
that gang l....

633
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:33,290
ln three years, l never
killed one of own.

634
01:04:33,393 --> 01:04:36,157
That's because you never
lost anything.

635
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:38,820
l grew up in the Cambodian
war.

636
01:04:38,965 --> 01:04:41,559
l lost far too many things.

637
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:44,636
So l don't let go of things
very easily.

638
01:04:47,907 --> 01:04:49,204
Uncle

639
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:52,276
Uncle, are you alright?

640
01:04:52,745 --> 01:04:54,770
Dad

641
01:04:54,914 --> 01:04:55,846
Uncle

642
01:04:57,016 --> 01:04:58,040
Uncle

643
01:05:05,758 --> 01:05:08,226
l'm Ho Cheung-Ching.

644
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:10,761
May be you've heard my name.

645
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:13,390
Both of you are very capable

646
01:05:13,566 --> 01:05:18,094
Opening a garage so soon
after leaving Vietnam

647
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:23,305
No matter where you go, you
will make good.

648
01:05:24,277 --> 01:05:28,976
You two were good companions
to Miss Chow.

649
01:05:29,015 --> 01:05:30,983
Every man has price.

650
01:05:31,084 --> 01:05:33,279
l'll pay you compensation.

651
01:05:34,153 --> 01:05:37,554
You've been here long enough

652
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,956
l want you to leave Hong
Kong.

653
01:05:40,326 --> 01:05:43,295
You're lucky to leave alive.
Don't come back.

654
01:05:43,429 --> 01:05:44,896
Don't think that just
because you left Vietnam,

655
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:46,623
and came here that things
would be peaceful.

656
01:05:46,766 --> 01:05:48,290
There's no difference.

657
01:05:48,468 --> 01:05:51,528
You're lucky the flower
basket didn't kill you.

658
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:53,639
But luck doesn't last
forever.

659
01:05:53,773 --> 01:05:57,470
l've said what l wanted to
say. You may leave.

660
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:00,843
Go to hell.

661
01:06:01,514 --> 01:06:02,538
Mark.

662
01:06:16,562 --> 01:06:17,961
You have one bullet.

663
01:06:17,997 --> 01:06:19,692
See who has the guts to fire

664
01:06:19,732 --> 01:06:22,292
Not many willing to roll
the dice in this world.

665
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,963
lf you can't afford to
gamble, don't gamble.

666
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:27,470
lt may not be fair.

667
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,636
Mark, forget about me. Kill
the bastard.

668
01:06:31,043 --> 01:06:32,510
Don't act rashly.

669
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:34,744
You think there's a choice?

670
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,340
No. lf there were a choice,

671
01:06:37,383 --> 01:06:39,851
millions of Vietnamese
wouldn't be trying to escape

672
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:42,317
There wouldn't be so many
beggars on the street.

673
01:06:42,421 --> 01:06:45,049
The world wouldn't have so
many people starving.

674
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:47,954
People don't have choices.

675
01:06:48,828 --> 01:06:51,126
Don't worry about me.

676
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:57,363
Don't give up your gun.

677
01:06:58,204 --> 01:06:59,466
Mun

678
01:07:31,237 --> 01:07:37,608
Dad, l should have let you
stay in Vietnam.

679
01:07:39,412 --> 01:07:43,280
We went through so much to
bring you here.

680
01:07:43,482 --> 01:07:51,287
lf you'd stayed in Saifon,
you'd still be alive.

681
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,225
Dad

682
01:08:30,696 --> 01:08:33,961
Kit's come to pay her last
respect to Dad.

683
01:08:38,204 --> 01:08:40,798
l'm responsible for his
death.

684
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:45,777
Don't be silly. You didn't
send those flowers.

685
01:08:45,911 --> 01:08:48,436
lf it weren't for me, Uncle
wouldn't have died.

686
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:51,979
You mustn't stay apart
because of me.

687
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:56,178
Kit, there isn't any more
time.

688
01:08:56,555 --> 01:08:58,921
They're forcing us to leave
Hong Kong.

689
01:09:01,894 --> 01:09:04,886
Will you agree to go away
with Mark?

690
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:08,865
l'll help Mark pack his
things.

691
01:09:09,035 --> 01:09:10,593
Tomorrow l'll buy plane
tickets and see you off.

692
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:13,603
Mun, you've to go, too.

693
01:09:17,777 --> 01:09:19,870
We all leave tomorrow.

694
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:25,549
Ok. l'll find Ling and
start packing.

695
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:41,490
l brought you a gift from
Vietnam.

696
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:44,298
But l never had the chance
to give it to you.

697
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:48,266
See if you like it.

698
01:09:48,974 --> 01:09:50,498
Thanks

699
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,083
lt's beautiful.

700
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:05,656
Try it on and see.

701
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:22,072
No matter what happens
tomorrow,

702
01:10:22,108 --> 01:10:25,202
we must be honest with each
other.

703
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,776
Sorry, l lied to you.

704
01:11:31,811 --> 01:11:35,303
Actually, l'm not going
with you.

705
01:11:35,347 --> 01:11:38,111
You don't have to revenge
on Ho.

706
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:40,618
You two can't deal with him.

707
01:11:40,653 --> 01:11:44,680
l can't. lf l must perish
with him, so be it.

708
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:48,056
The problems are my
responsibility.

709
01:11:48,327 --> 01:11:50,625
Let me settle it

710
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:54,929
Settle them? How can you
do that?

711
01:11:54,967 --> 01:11:58,425
Ho is returning to Vietnam,
to repossess his property.

712
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:01,440
We have an old score to
settle.

713
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:03,738
Please take care of Mark.

714
01:12:03,776 --> 01:12:06,472
What good is it if you die?

715
01:12:07,613 --> 01:12:10,411
What do you plan to do?

716
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,044
l'll take the morning plane
with Ho.

717
01:12:14,153 --> 01:12:18,021
l know that Mark won't be
able to forgive me....

718
01:12:18,157 --> 01:12:20,057
...for going with Ho back
to Vietnam.

719
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:22,320
lf l never make it back
alive,

720
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:26,227
l hope that you'll explain
everything to him.

721
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:28,266
Tell Mark that l didn't
betray him.

722
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:32,131
l hope he'll understand and
not hate me.

723
01:13:04,803 --> 01:13:09,763
lt doesn't look like Saigon
will last much longer.

724
01:13:12,077 --> 01:13:16,480
So we must get our money out
while there's time.

725
01:13:16,615 --> 01:13:19,015
The situation out there...

726
01:13:19,151 --> 01:13:21,881
reminds me of 1945.

727
01:13:22,087 --> 01:13:25,215
The Japanese Army was
retreating from lndochina.

728
01:13:25,324 --> 01:13:28,259
My Dad was a Japanese
businessman here.

729
01:13:28,427 --> 01:13:30,588
But he couldn't bear to
leave his property behind.

730
01:13:30,696 --> 01:13:32,721
ln the end, he was executed
by guerillas.

731
01:13:32,831 --> 01:13:34,128
l was 6 at the time.

732
01:13:34,266 --> 01:13:37,235
ln order to survive, l
assumed a Chinese name--Ho.

733
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:40,702
After all these years,
l've almost forgotten.

734
01:13:40,773 --> 01:13:42,638
My real name is Tanaka.

735
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:57,952
Mr. Ho, they are searching
the vehicle ahead of us.

736
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:11,727
Don't worry.

737
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:27,050
Phone me as soon as you and
Ling get to Taiwan.

738
01:14:27,152 --> 01:14:28,346
Take care

739
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:30,185
Where are you going?

740
01:14:30,222 --> 01:14:31,450
To the airport.

741
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,752
You brought the plane
tickets?

742
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:33,780
Yeah.

743
01:14:33,826 --> 01:14:35,157
What about Kit? You're not
waiting for her?

744
01:14:35,194 --> 01:14:36,559
We arranged to meet at the
airport.

745
01:14:36,595 --> 01:14:38,028
She didn't say she was going
to the airport.

746
01:14:38,063 --> 01:14:39,189
We arranged it. She'll be
there for sure.

747
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:43,964
Mark, don't lie. Kit isn't
even in Hong Kong.

748
01:14:52,544 --> 01:14:55,012
Where is she?

749
01:14:58,784 --> 01:15:03,915
She took the morning flight
to Vietnam.

750
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:08,451
He went with Ho.

751
01:15:08,594 --> 01:15:11,995
So there's no need for you
to go looking for Ho.

752
01:15:49,068 --> 01:15:51,832
Pat

753
01:16:03,315 --> 01:16:05,010
Nobody here

754
01:16:37,983 --> 01:16:39,245
lt's Pat

755
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:40,376
Pat

756
01:16:40,452 --> 01:16:42,044
Don't shoot

757
01:16:44,556 --> 01:16:46,353
You forgot us so quickly

758
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:48,757
Mun, look He's a soldier

759
01:17:06,178 --> 01:17:08,112
What is he talking about?

760
01:17:12,618 --> 01:17:15,382
How is father?

761
01:17:19,391 --> 01:17:22,883
Have you received any of his
letter?

762
01:17:30,602 --> 01:17:33,036
What is he talking about?

763
01:17:33,172 --> 01:17:36,403
With the Yanks leaving,
there's an oil shortage.

764
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:39,010
The phones are out of order,
too.

765
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:41,612
We'll have to split up and
search for Kit.

766
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:05,394
Miss Chow, so we meet again

767
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:08,928
ln this world, those who
should die never die

768
01:18:09,107 --> 01:18:11,075
Why should people like you
survive?

769
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:14,043
Thanks to you l was jailed
for ywo months.

770
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:18,310
But you won't be so lucky
this time.

771
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:22,478
Lock them up. Deal with
them the army way.

772
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:28,685
So you're Bong? l'm Ho.

773
01:18:28,961 --> 01:18:30,986
Kit's boss.

774
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:34,297
l'd like to talk business
with you.

775
01:18:36,401 --> 01:18:39,495
lf we can work together,

776
01:18:39,638 --> 01:18:41,606
l'll give you US$3 million.

777
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:43,800
We'll both come out ahead.

778
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:46,377
Ok, but l won't let you
leave my side.

779
01:18:46,445 --> 01:18:48,174
No problem.

780
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:50,508
But l have one condition:

781
01:18:50,616 --> 01:18:54,313
l hear that all flights
might stop at any moment.

782
01:18:54,419 --> 01:18:56,148
You army people have your
own methods.

783
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,713
lf you can get me some
documents,

784
01:18:59,858 --> 01:19:01,849
and use military connections
to get us out,

785
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:04,452
l'll pay you immediately.

786
01:19:37,496 --> 01:19:41,193
Mun, l found Miss Chow.

787
01:19:43,468 --> 01:19:45,698
Does Mark know?

788
01:19:45,871 --> 01:19:47,031
Mark hasn't come back yet.

789
01:19:47,105 --> 01:19:49,539
But Miss Chow only wants
to see you.

790
01:19:53,645 --> 01:19:55,078
Let's not wait for Mark.

791
01:19:55,113 --> 01:19:56,705
l'll take you over to Miss
Chow's.

792
01:19:56,815 --> 01:19:57,782
lf she leaves,

793
01:19:57,849 --> 01:20:00,875
it'll be impossible to find
her again. We better hurry

794
01:20:35,554 --> 01:20:39,615
Mark's here, too. He really
wants to see you.

795
01:20:39,891 --> 01:20:41,415
Here are two plane tickets.

796
01:20:41,526 --> 01:20:43,960
Saigon will fall soon. All
flights have stopped.

797
01:20:44,096 --> 01:20:45,757
Only two seats left for me
last flight out tomorrow.

798
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:47,558
You and Mark must go.

799
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:50,566
We're Hong Kong citizens.
We're not in any danger.

800
01:20:50,669 --> 01:20:52,864
There's a war going on here.

801
01:20:52,938 --> 01:20:55,304
With a change in government,
anything can happen.

802
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,274
Kit, if it's so serious, you
should come with us.

803
01:20:59,711 --> 01:21:02,646
l still have business to
attend to here.

804
01:21:03,882 --> 01:21:06,817
Don't worry. Ho and Bong
have an agreement.

805
01:21:06,952 --> 01:21:08,977
We'll get out with the
military's help.

806
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:12,614
No way l can't let you
leave us again.

807
01:21:12,724 --> 01:21:15,591
The only reason we came
back was for you.

808
01:21:16,194 --> 01:21:17,661
l want to take you back
to see Mark.

809
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:22,165
Mun, when you're in the
midst of a war,

810
01:21:22,234 --> 01:21:23,724
you must put your emotions
to the side,

811
01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:24,801
and just survive

812
01:21:24,903 --> 01:21:26,598
l shouldn't have let you
come back.

813
01:21:26,705 --> 01:21:28,036
You can't solve all of our
problems by yourself.

814
01:21:28,106 --> 01:21:31,542
l'll tell Pat to bring Mark
here. Wait for him.

815
01:21:33,445 --> 01:21:35,413
l don't have time to wait.

816
01:21:35,514 --> 01:21:40,178
At times like this, who has
the right to make requests?

817
01:21:40,285 --> 01:21:42,617
Nothing is ever really one's
own.

818
01:21:45,023 --> 01:21:48,049
The more hopes you have,
the greater the pain.

819
01:21:48,193 --> 01:21:50,024
l can't see him again.
- No

820
01:21:55,467 --> 01:21:59,699
Kit Kit

821
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:49,674
Mun, are you alright?

822
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:51,510
Can you move?
- Yes.

823
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:52,913
Leave now.

824
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:37,059
Pat

825
01:24:37,095 --> 01:24:39,256
This is wooden wall.

826
01:24:56,014 --> 01:24:58,710
Mun, look

827
01:26:01,012 --> 01:26:03,742
Mun

828
01:26:18,963 --> 01:26:21,124
Who is it?

829
01:26:46,391 --> 01:26:48,882
ls Mun dead?

830
01:26:57,902 --> 01:27:01,633
Actually, you decided long
ago to return with Ho.

831
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:04,607
So why did you look us up
in Hong Kong?

832
01:27:05,877 --> 01:27:07,777
You knew that l came back
to Saigon with Mun,

833
01:27:07,846 --> 01:27:10,679
so why did you only want
to see him?

834
01:27:10,782 --> 01:27:12,249
You have so many secrets.

835
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:15,114
What else haven't you told
me?

836
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:20,984
l have nothing to explain.

837
01:27:21,226 --> 01:27:23,820
lf you say l'm wrong then
l'm wrong.

838
01:27:23,928 --> 01:27:25,520
l've never regretted
anything.

839
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:36,733
You really know how to
handle a gun.

840
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:39,742
You've killed so many people

841
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:44,340
Even Mun died at your hand.

842
01:27:44,849 --> 01:27:47,317
Why don't you shoot me, too?

843
01:27:51,289 --> 01:27:54,816
How many will you kill
before you're happy?

844
01:27:56,628 --> 01:27:59,791
There's no reason behind our
actions.

845
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:02,092
Who is right, who is wrong,

846
01:28:02,233 --> 01:28:05,134
someday you'll understand.

847
01:28:08,406 --> 01:28:11,239
When Mun came,

848
01:28:11,376 --> 01:28:14,436
he told me over and over
that,

849
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:16,274
if you find someone whom you
truly love,

850
01:28:16,381 --> 01:28:19,441
never give them up, even if
it means death.

851
01:28:19,584 --> 01:28:22,052
He said that you'd never
betray me.

852
01:28:22,187 --> 01:28:26,647
But now l know what kind
of a person you are.

853
01:28:30,862 --> 01:28:34,730
Even if you aren't my enemy,

854
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:38,234
l never want to see you
again as long as l live.

855
01:28:38,269 --> 01:28:39,099
Mark

856
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,432
Mark

857
01:30:19,704 --> 01:30:21,831
Mark

858
01:30:27,912 --> 01:30:29,709
Mun isn't dead He's over
there Hurry

859
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:31,109
Hurry

860
01:30:37,622 --> 01:30:38,714
Mun

861
01:30:41,526 --> 01:30:42,288
Mun

862
01:30:42,393 --> 01:30:43,223
Mark

863
01:30:45,663 --> 01:30:46,789
Mun

864
01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:50,261
Have you seen Kit?

865
01:30:50,435 --> 01:30:55,134
Where's Kit? Why isn't she
with you?

866
01:30:55,406 --> 01:30:56,430
Kit?

867
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:23,693
This is the cash left in
Vietnam.

868
01:32:23,795 --> 01:32:25,262
lt's mine.

869
01:32:25,496 --> 01:32:29,091
No matter where l go, it'll
always return to my side.

870
01:32:29,267 --> 01:32:33,704
Things that don't belong to
you will never be yours.

871
01:32:49,053 --> 01:32:51,487
Don't move.

872
01:32:51,723 --> 01:32:54,988
Mr. Ho, we're both playing
for the same stakes.

873
01:32:55,093 --> 01:32:56,287
l'm in charge here.

874
01:32:56,394 --> 01:32:58,294
You can't fight me without
shattering yourself.

875
01:32:58,396 --> 01:33:00,796
The U.S. Consulate is
burning its cash.

876
01:33:00,898 --> 01:33:03,458
They're treating thier money
like garbage.

877
01:33:03,568 --> 01:33:07,436
But to us, this green paper
money...

878
01:33:07,538 --> 01:33:10,132
...is worth dying for and
killing for.

879
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:13,070
Miss Chow, don't move

880
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:15,645
Put your gun down

881
01:34:04,562 --> 01:34:07,929
At times like this l realize
how much we need each other.

882
01:34:45,403 --> 01:34:48,497
Why did you bring a time
bomb?

883
01:34:48,673 --> 01:34:51,267
Mark is in Vietnam.

884
01:34:51,843 --> 01:34:55,939
l know that neither of you
will let the other go.

885
01:34:58,115 --> 01:35:01,573
What is so great about Mark,

886
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:03,610
that you'd pay such a price?

887
01:35:03,754 --> 01:35:06,882
When you pay the final price

888
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:09,426
You haven't time to consider
its worth.

889
01:35:12,964 --> 01:35:14,829
Ok

890
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:23,236
Mark, where are you?

891
01:35:30,715 --> 01:35:32,546
Ho Cheung-Ching?

892
01:35:41,292 --> 01:35:42,520
Ho Cheung-Ching?

893
01:36:10,855 --> 01:36:14,052
l'm not Ho Cheung-Ching

894
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:18,788
My name is the same as God's

895
01:36:18,829 --> 01:36:23,698
There is no meaning to my
name.

896
01:36:23,768 --> 01:36:26,601
Listen, my real name is...

897
01:36:26,637 --> 01:36:29,435
When you die, l want you to
know who killed you.

898
01:36:29,473 --> 01:36:31,338
Even God will not care.

899
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:34,776
A man is responsible for his
own actions.

900
01:36:34,812 --> 01:36:37,246
lt's becoming a slaughter-
house out there.

901
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:39,442
Everyone is after revenge.

902
01:36:39,483 --> 01:36:42,850
Welcome to our vengeful
world.

903
01:36:42,887 --> 01:36:46,084
This place is like hell.

904
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:48,481
You have no way to go.

905
01:36:48,526 --> 01:36:53,088
l know The last plane out
of Vietnam has left.

906
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:57,965
lt makes no difference if l
live or die.

907
01:36:58,269 --> 01:37:02,399
l just want to see blood
debts paid in blood.

908
01:37:05,142 --> 01:37:07,372
You've a just a garage
mechanic

909
01:37:07,545 --> 01:37:09,445
Remember,

910
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:12,913
what goes around, comes
around.

911
01:37:13,017 --> 01:37:15,042
You'll get what you deserve

912
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:27,130
My gun is already out of
bullets.

913
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:30,190
You have your chance.

914
01:38:07,405 --> 01:38:10,704
Don't shoot

915
01:38:33,264 --> 01:38:34,390

916
01:38:59,857 --> 01:39:02,189
After all these years with
you,

917
01:39:02,226 --> 01:39:05,753
the only my regret is
injuring Miss Chow.

918
01:39:11,202 --> 01:39:13,966
Mr. Ho, when you go to the
airport,

919
01:39:14,004 --> 01:39:16,268
the most important thing
is to bring the money.

920
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,668
Kit

921
01:39:17,975 --> 01:39:20,944
Why did you come back?

922
01:39:21,512 --> 01:39:26,006
lf l didn't, l'd regret it
the rest of my life.

01:39:29,186 --> 01:39:32,019
l've never regretted
anything.

Kit

925
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:49,065
You said l'll be repaid for
what l did, but where is it?

926
01:39:49,106 --> 01:39:52,803
The price of our actions
will be paid by our

01:39:52,843 --> 01:39:54,902
loved ones

928
01:39:56,647 --> 01:39:59,810
No matter what, l'm going
to get even.

lf you shoot, l'll be
grateful.

01:40:04,755 --> 01:40:07,223
Grateful for bringing Kit
and me together.
