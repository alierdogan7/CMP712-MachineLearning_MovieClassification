1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,760
IN TIMES LIKE THESE ESCAPE IS THE
ONLY WAY TO STAY ALIVE...

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,600
AND TO CONTINUE DREAMING.
(HENRY LABORIT)

3
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,000
They send us on a mission on
Mighisti, a lost Aegean isle...

4
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,760
the smallest and most distant one.
its strategic importance was zero.

5
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,600
Our orders were to
observe and make contact.

6
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,400
We were to occupy and report.
The men assigned to me came from...

7
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,320
...all over. Survivors from
lost battles...

8
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,200
men from disbanded regiments.

9
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,040
A platoon of misfits like myself,
who had happened to survive.

10
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,800
Eliseo Strazzabosco, the mule-driver
was a strange guy.

11
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,560
He'd spent the whole war with his
Silvana. He'd brought her from home.

12
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,440
He loved her like a person.
Maybe even more.

13
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,320
Hey, Strazzabosco!
Sweet grapes, eh?

14
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,080
A honeymoon in the Aegean.
I think tonight...

15
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,840
Pretend you didn't hear.
Don't give them the satisfaction.

16
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,720
There were the Munaron brothers,
Libero and Felice.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,520
Two mountain boys who had
never seen the sea.

18
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,360
And there were Lo Russo
and Colasanti.

19
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,280
You got anything to drink?

20
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Lo Russo ha reached the rank of Sergeant
Major in the African Campaign.

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,960
What might he become by the war's
end? Colasanti, the signalman...

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,800
lived in Lo Russo's shadow practically
in symbiosis. Then there was Corrado...

23
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Noventa, the deserter.

24
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,600
He'd already escaped a few times,
trying to get home.

25
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,440
His wife was pregnant.
Last time they caught him...

26
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,200
between Albania and Yugoslavia,
trying to walk home to Italy.

27
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,040
My attendant, Antonio Farina,
was very devoted to me...

28
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
always ready for orders, at times
even anticipating my thoughts.

29
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,720
-How much longer, Lieutenant?
-Not much.

30
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,440
-Will there be shooting?
-Let's hope not.

31
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,200
We were all at the age where
one hasn't decided whether...

32
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,080
to start a family or
lose oneself in the world.

33
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,920
Lieutenant, how long do we
have to stay here?

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,840
Four months.

35
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
Fuck!

36
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,360
Silvana, don't make a fuss.

37
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,120
Don't make me look bad in front of the
Sergeant. Calm down, relax!

38
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,400
Munaron!

39
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Give me the radio!

40
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,000
Watch out for the radio!

41
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,960
Lieutenant, do we put on the
gas masks now?

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,760
-Nonsense!
-Why'd we bring all this stuff?

43
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,640
Lieutenant, what's written there?

44
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,120
-Greece is the tomb "battalion".
-What does tomb "battalion" mean?

45
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,960
All right, men. We'll all advance
very quietly inland.

46
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,800
Keep your eyes open. Strazza, at the
rear. CoIasanti, in the middle to...

47
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
make sure the radio is safe. Once on top,
we'll estabLlsh a base. Understood?

48
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
Yes, but what does tomb "batallion" mean?

49
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
"Of Italians."

50
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,200
-What?
-"Greece is the tomb of Italians."

51
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,640
There's nobody here.

52
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
-Your head's burning. You're hot, eh?
-Hell!

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,160
No objections? I'll go in.

54
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,040
This time we agree?

55
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,160
Not a fucking soul!
There's nobody in this town.

56
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,440
Are you crazy?

57
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,240
Didn't you see me? I'm Farina.
Excuse me! You almost killed me!

58
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,040
-We heard a shot, so we fired.
-Who the hell fired?

59
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,840
-Farina did, Lieutenant!
-We saw him fire.

60
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,640
-He shot, so we fired.
-Wait! Lieutenant, I saw the whole thing.

61
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Farina got attacked by a chicken and
reacted. The men, taken by surprise...

62
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,240
thought we were being attacked
by Greek chickens.

63
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's not kid around.
You could have killed him!

64
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,880
-It was no big Ioss...
-Stop joking.

65
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,680
I was only joking. I meant
better a dead chicken than...

66
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,440
It was just to keep up the morale of
the troops. You're a bunch of idiots!

67
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,720
No smoking
on guard duty.

68
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Fuck off, Strazzabosco!

69
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,320
If they spot your cigarette, they
can shoot you in the forehead.

70
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,080
What are you smoking?

71
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Millet.

72
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,840
Give me a drag.

73
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,560
I gave you a scare, huh?

74
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,360
-What's happening?
-Did you hear? Look!

75
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,040
Alarm!

76
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,640
-Who the hell yelled?
-Farina gave the alarm.

77
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Look there.

78
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,920
We're kicking their asses, eh?

79
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Lieutenant, our side is really beating them!

80
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,640
Lieutenant, I hear something
but it's mostly static.

81
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,920
Here, Lieutenant.

82
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,760
-What do they say?
-Wait.

83
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,600
What about our man?
Where are they?

84
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,480
Wait, I don't understand.

85
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,280
-It's the British.
-They're speaking English.

86
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Lieutenant, tell us, too.

87
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,920
-What about us?
-I don't know!

88
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,760
You don't know!

89
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,640
-What do you know?
-Boy, I don't know.

90
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,480
I understand.

91
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,320
Everyone in position! Maximum alert!
Stay alert and don't move. The Brits...

92
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,200
could land any minute.
Understood?

93
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Stop, who's there?

94
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,320
It's me, Lo Russo.

95
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,960
-Password.
-It's me, I said.

96
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,760
-Identify yourself. Password?
-I told you, it's me, Lo Russo.

97
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,680
The password, or we shoot.

98
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,520
All right...

99
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,240
"Savoy or death".

100
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,080
O.K., Sergeant, you may come closer.

101
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,960
O.K., my ass!
Counter password?

102
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,720
"Memento audere semper."

103
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,640
No, you're wrong.

104
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,520
-"Lightning!
-No!

105
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,360
-That's was yesterday's password.
-"Pizza Margherita!"

106
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
Sure! ''Four Seasons"!

107
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,160
-It's ''Queen Margherita"!
-Yes, it's ''Queen Margherita".

108
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,000
We're supposed to conquer Greece
with these four idiots?!

109
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,880
Tomorrow I'll turn you all in.
Understood?

110
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,760
-Go take a shit!
-Who said that?

111
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,600
Who?
Come on out! Bastards!

112
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,400
I know that one.
I recognized him. Shit-face!

113
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
It wasn't me!

114
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,240
It wasn't me!

115
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,000
"It wasn't me!" Two days' punishment
for all and four days for shit-face!

116
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,840
Quiet!

117
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,520
The British, I feel it.

118
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,360
Who goes there?
What's the password!

119
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,240
Identify yourself, or I shoot.

120
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,040
Lieutenant, if it's you, say so.

121
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,760
No! Don't shoot!

122
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,680
Don't shoot.

123
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,160
Silvana!

124
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,040
My Silvana.

125
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,920
It was Silvana, boys, but...

126
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,800
But I gave you specific orders...

127
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,440
-You said to shoot, and we obeyed.
-No. I said, ''Stop, who goes there?"

128
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,320
"Identify yourself or I'll shoot."

129
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,080
Lieutenant, I said, ''Identify yourself
or I'll shoot." These guys fired.

130
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,040
Strazza,
it wasn't our fault.

131
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,920
Bastards!

132
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,840
-Easy!
-Bastards!

133
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,520
This morning the chickens, now the
donkey! How will we carry the stuff?

134
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,320
-The radio!
-Shit! My radio!

135
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,440
-Broken?
-I don't know.

136
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,360
-Can it be fixed?
-I don't know.

137
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,200
-Why don't you know?
-I said I don't know.

138
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,880
It was our most important equipment!
To be kept in top working condition!

139
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,720
We depended on it, and then that
cretin of a mountain man broke it!

140
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,600
Don't yell. Blaming him won't
help now. Stay calm.

141
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Calm, my ass! Stay calm, my ass!
We're cut off from the war!

142
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,160
How do we communicate now?
With smoke signals?

143
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,080
My Silvana...

144
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,200
There's nothing.

145
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,840
O.K. boys, you'll stay here.
For observation and Liaison.

146
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,600
When you see a ship, send up the
signal flares. Toward us, not them.

147
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,480
In two, three days
I'll send another shift.

148
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,280
Don't worry about us. We're
not too familiar with the sea.

149
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,120
If the relief shift isn't
obligatory, we'll stay here.

150
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,000
We'll come get our supplies.

151
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,840
-Suit yourselves.
-Thank you, Lieutenant.

152
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,720
Lieutenant, one second.

153
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,560
Munaron.

154
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,360
The mission is now documented.

155
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,280
See you.

156
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,280
ITALY, I THINK AND DREAM OF YOU.

157
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Good morning, Lieutenant.

158
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,760
-Good morning, Lieutenant.
-Good morning.

159
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,640
Some island!

160
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,480
-An isIand of ghosts. There's nobody here.
-The radio?...

161
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,320
-Any news?
-I've reassembled it. It won't work.

162
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm worried about the man
because nothing's happening...

163
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,880
and especially Strazzabosco.
He's always by himself, withdrawn...

164
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,640
and now his Silvana's dead...

165
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,480
So let's invent something to
boost their morale.

166
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,240
We could have them
dig a nice trench.

167
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,080
-What for?
-Nothing. They'll dig it and cover it up.

168
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,760
-They'll get demoralised.
-Let's mount a simulated attack.

169
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,600
-In this heat?
-Then what can I do to...

170
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,400
-keep up their spirits?
-Listen, Lo Russo, think of something.

171
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,240
Now excuse me. I have to
update the military diary.

172
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,120
I didn't reaLlze...

173
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,080
-Farina, are you married?
-No.

174
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,880
-Engaged?
-No.

175
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,680
-Is anyone back home waiting for you?
-My folks died when I was little.

176
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,560
I never knew them.

177
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,240
It's nice here, right?

178
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,040
Well...

179
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,880
This may seem like an arid place,
a place for sheep...

180
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,680
but here, 2,500 years ago, before Rome,
there was a beautiful civilisation.

181
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,480
There were poets, philosophers,
warriors, goddesses.

182
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,200
We're all their descendants. Even you can
find your origins here. You understand?

183
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,720
Do you like poetry?

184
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,560
It depends.

185
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,360
Look... these were written
seven centuries before Christ.

186
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,880
You know how to read?

187
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,720
-Not in Greek.
-Each poem is translated.

188
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,760
The mountain peaks sleep, along with
the valleys, cliffs and gorges...

189
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
and creatures of the brown earth...

190
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,760
Wake up! They've landed!
I saw them! They're here!

191
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,680
Lieutenant, wake up!

192
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,520
-What happened, Sergeant?
-Where did they land?

193
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,280
-They're everywhere! Many of them!
-The British?

194
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,120
No! I tried catching one,
but they disappeared.

195
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,880
-Who are they?
-Children.

196
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Strange, isn't it?
There are no men.

197
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,640
-Just old men and children.
-It's fishy.

198
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,400
-It could be an ambush.
-I remember a similar situation in Spain.

199
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,320
-Sure, sure!
-Not again!

200
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Well, don't complain to me Iater...

201
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,120
Madame, hello.

202
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,920
The men... the soldiers,
where are they?

203
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,360
She still has a papa?

204
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,040
You can speak Italian to me.
I spent twenty years in Rhodes.

205
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,800
Italians... Greeks...
my face, my race...

206
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,680
One face, one race.

207
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,360
Father, where did all of you go?

208
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,240
Why wasn't anyone here
when we arrived?

209
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,080
The Germans were here before you.

210
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,840
They destroyed all the houses
and sank the boats.

211
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,640
They took all our men away--
deported them.

212
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,360
When we saw your ship, we
thought they had come back.

213
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,240
So... we hid.

214
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,120
I know the Italians well.

215
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,960
We don't like strangers in
our country, but...

216
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,800
it's lesser of two evils.

217
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,600
I assure you, we'll create the
least possible disturbance.

218
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,360
I'd advise you to move into
the Mayor's house.

219
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,240
You'll be more comfortable.

220
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,760
Where are you going?
We're friends!

221
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
Friends, friends.

222
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,520
Wait! Come here!

223
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,760
Regulations prohibit
fraternizing with the locals.

224
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
The first one who touches
woman, hen or rooster...

225
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,440
will be court-martialled.
Understood?

226
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,320
Why are you always screaming?
Help us instead.

227
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,200
Sergeant Lo Russo screams
whenever he wants to because...

228
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:09,000
sergeants scream.
Is that clear? Is that clear???

229
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,480
A good hand!

230
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,360
I'm just a dilettante.

231
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,120
This man reminds me of the picture
of Homer in my school textbook.

232
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,800
For the first time since I
left home I feel good.

233
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,520
You're strange, you know?

234
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,360
You don't seem like a soldier.

235
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,160
The army called me back. In peacetime
I'm a high school teacher.

236
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,880
-Did I speak it right?
-You speak Greek very well.

237
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,720
I learned Greek through books.
The lliad, the Odyssey, the poets.

238
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,560
I teach about Greece but I've never
been here. With my saIary...

239
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,440
Who knows. Maybe this is destiny.

240
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,280
Maybe I'm asking too much....

241
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,960
but... have you seen our church?

242
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,880
It's badly damaged.

243
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,640
Would you consider...
painting... the walls?

244
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,440
I'd be honored but I'm not
good enough to paint frescoes.

245
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,240
Of course you're good enough!
For free, of course.

246
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,080
Sergeant, I found these
enormous peppers.

247
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,880
For your back-ache I'll fix
a board for your bed.

248
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,520
I'm also fixing up a piece
of Ieather...

249
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,440
Be careful!

250
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,360
Leather...

251
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,160
-How will you cook the peppers?
-Stuffed.

252
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,080
Sergeant!

253
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,000
Hi, Noventa.

254
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,880
-Guess what I've got.
-A letter.

255
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,760
Yes, to my wife.
I'll leave it with you?

256
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,640
Yes, I'll send it.

257
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,560
-It's important. How long will it take?
-Like the others.

258
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,400
-I didn't put a stamp.
-No problem. You can go, Noventa.

259
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,320
Thanks.

260
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,160
-You've seen the Lieutenant?
-No.

261
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,040
-The Lieutenant's not here?
-No.

262
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,800
There's a woman outside asking
to talk to the commander.

263
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,640
-The Lieutenant isn't here?
-The Lieutenant's painting frescoes.

264
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,560
We're sweating here,
he's in a cool church.

265
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,360
Should I show her in?

266
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,080
If she wants to talk, show her in.
If not, she can stay outside.

267
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,920
Lo Russo...

268
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,800
beautiful.

269
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,640
She's beautiful.

270
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,360
That's her.

271
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
-Good morning.
-You're the captain?

272
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,840
Yes, I am.

273
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,560
-I'm Vassllissa. Vassllissa.
-Vassllissa?

274
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,480
-Yes.
-A beautiful name.

275
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm Lo Russo...
NicoIa.

276
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:29,000
-I speak... for ''DuLlam".
-I don't know ''DuLlam". Sorry.

277
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,720
You don't?
Ergassia, you understand?

278
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,560
Do we know Ergassia?
DuLlam Ergassia?

279
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,160
-Work! ... Work!
-Work?

280
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,960
You want to talk about work?
What kind of work do you do?

281
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm a ''puta".

282
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,720
-"Puta" is Greek for...?
-A whore.

283
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,560
-Please! !
-Yes! Right! Whore! Yes.

284
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,520
Good.

285
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,280
Good... I mean... there are different
ways of saying the same thing.

286
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,200
You're interested?

287
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,880
I have to glance at
the reguIations...

288
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,720
-but we're very... we'd be interested.
-Fine.

289
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:30,320
And where... let's say... do you
conduct your... where do these...

290
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,080
-manifestations take place? The house?
-My house.

291
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,920
-Your house.
-The blue house... blue.

292
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Off on Thursday.

293
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,640
Friday, Saturday, double shifts.
Sunday: day off. Understood?

294
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,520
-Why not alternate days?
-Because this is what I decided.

295
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,320
The order is based on age and rank.
So, I'm first.

296
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,160
-The Lieutenant's first.
-He doesn't go with whores. I'm first.

297
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,000
Then Colasanti, then Noventa,
Strazzabosco and then little Farina.

298
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,880
-And the two brothers?
-The damn Munarons!

299
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,800
Mind your own business!

300
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm asking for a volunteer to call
the two brothers up in the mountain.

301
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,360
Without a volunteer, the
brothers stay where they are.

302
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:06,280
Speak to me of love, Marie.
All my life, it's you.

303
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:14,920
Your lovely eyes are shining
Like two stars, they twinkle

304
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,880
-Sergeant?
-Thanks, dear.

305
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,680
Tell me it's not a dream...
I destroyed her.

306
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,440
Tell me you're all mine.

307
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,240
Instead of reading poetry, sing!
You'll stop being afraid.

308
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,040
Here, under your heart,
I'm no longer suffering.

309
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,600
Bye.

310
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,880
Vassllissa...

311
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,560
Miss Vassllissa.

312
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,160
Vassllissa!

313
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,800
Farina, get the ball!

314
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,560
-She won't give it to me.
-Get going! Get it!

315
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,200
Thanks.

316
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,760
Alarm flares from the Munarons.
Call the Lieutenant!

317
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,600
All civilians in their homes!
The enemy's here! Hurry!

318
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,840
Who is it? The British?

319
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,720
I don't see anyone yet!

320
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,600
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.

321
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,440
-You signalled the alarm?
-Yes, Lieutenant.

322
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,320
It's a ship with a red flag.

323
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,160
-Shit! The Russians.
-The flag's not exactly Russian.

324
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,040
-It's more like Turkish.
-Yeah, Turkish.

325
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,840
-Are the Turks on our side?
-What kind of ship?

326
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,680
-Like a fishing boat.
-A fishing boat.

327
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,600
You signalled about a fishing boat?

328
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,360
-We were told to report anything...
-You did well. It could be a spy.

329
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,280
There he is.

330
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,920
Italians... Turks...
One face, one race!

331
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,680
I think it isn't only tobacco.

332
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,480
Say what you want. There's something
else in it. Not just tobacco.

333
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,240
The smoke of oblivion.
Like in the Odyssey.

334
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,160
Odyssey.

335
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,720
It tastes like sage.

336
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,400
Tell me, do you have other stuff?

337
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,280
Opium...
cash...

338
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,120
No, I meant rugs and such things.

339
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,000
No rugs, no rugs.

340
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,720
Lieutenant, rugs, cash, opium, who
gives a damn! He doesn't know anything.

341
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,600
-What's happening? What is going on?
-Where?

342
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,440
Where else? In ItaIy... in Europe!

343
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,320
-Dunno.
-What ''dunno"?

344
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,160
I mean Mussolini,
Hitler, Germany!

345
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,960
-Dunno!
-What?! Where did you come from?

346
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,720
Cash... Antalia... Fatie...
no war.

347
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,480
-Let's confiscate the boat.
-Why?

348
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,360
To go to Rhodes, to Italy.

349
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,200
-to where things are happening.
-Do you care that much?

350
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,040
Yes! We're in this God-forsaken place.

351
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,920
We don't know what's
happening anywhere.

352
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,640
Aren't you curious? I say, let's go to
the front where there's action.

353
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,400
Fine...

354
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,280
let's vote.

355
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,000
Whoever agrees with the sergeant
to confiscate poor Aziz's boat...

356
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,840
to face a very dangerous journey
to Rhodes for two days...

357
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,680
without any certainty of arriving,
raise your hand.

358
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,240
Whoever wishes to stay,
raise your hand.

359
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,960
I don't vote because of my rank.

360
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,880
We stay.

361
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,680
What kind of vote is that?

362
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,400
We're staying on the
island of oblivion.

363
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,280
Smoke some oblivion!

364
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,120
It was a rigged vote.

365
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,960
Did you ever think
we'd end up here?

366
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,360
Did you eat chicken with your fingers?
Your pipe's stuck to your hands.

367
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,280
Pass it around!

368
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,080
-What's chicken got to do with oblivion?
-They both stick to your fingers.

369
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,640
I think this stuff is banned
in Italy right now.

370
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,560
Why?

371
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,440
Under Fascism everything good
is prohibited.

372
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,280
-Would you, Emperor, legalise it?
-Who, the raisin?

373
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,160
-What raisin?
-What are you talking about?

374
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,040
-As Emperor...
-Sergeant Lo Russo.

375
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,800
No guard duty... Savoy, eh?
To the boat!

376
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,720
I don't agree.

377
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,440
With the sloppy and relaxed attitude
that prevails among you.

378
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,240
Being a comrade, I can't go 
against the tide...

379
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,080
I can't go against the wishes
of the majority.

380
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,920
I also understand your rebellious
attitude toward authority because of...

381
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,680
-the absolute negligence of the state.
-What the fuck are you saying, Lo Russo?

382
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,600
What are you saying?

383
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,440
I'm saying what I'm saying.
I too feeI...

384
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,320
abandoned by my country,
by Italy.

385
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,160
And I don't give a shit!
And I'll say it again!

386
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,920
They left us here, and here we'll stay!
They said, ''You'll manage", and...

387
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,840
we're managing.

388
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,680
-What are they saying, Aziz?
-Dunno.

389
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,520
You always ''dunno".
You dunno nothing!

390
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,200
Hi, Aziz. Friend... friend!

391
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,040
Take me home!
Take me along! Friends!

392
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,920
Italy, Turkey...
one face, one race!

393
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,640
He stole everything! Everything!

394
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,480
Now what! We stay here like
a bunch of idiots.

395
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,280
Never trust the Turks.

396
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,160
Hell, don't laugh, Father!
We don't even have a weapon.

397
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,000
How can we occupy the island?

398
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,920
Come with me.

399
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,800
Come with me.

400
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,920
We've had weapons all along.

401
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,840
We're friends, right?

402
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,680
Why won't you make love
with me?

403
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,560
-Because.
-Are you embarrassed?

404
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,240
What's the most beautiful
thing on earth?

405
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,040
Some say a swarm of knights, others
say infantrymen, yet others say ships.

406
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:57,680
I say it's the one I love. And then it
continues. A Greek poet wrote it...

407
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,600
over 2,000 years ago.

408
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,440
Yes, but why won't you make
love with me? Why?

409
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,800
-I've never done it.
-Never?

410
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,600
But...

411
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,440
I want the first time
to be for Iove...

412
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,320
really for love, you understand?

413
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,240
Life isn't enough...

414
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,120
One life isn't enough for me.

415
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,920
There aren't enough days...

416
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,840
too many things to do,
too many ideas...

417
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,560
Every sunset upsets me because
another day has gone by.

418
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,240
Then I'm moved,
because I'm aIone...

419
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,080
a tiny dot in the universe.

420
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,840
I'd like to watch sunsets
with my mother...

421
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,720
or with a woman I might love.

422
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,560
I'd like to spend the nights
aIone... alone, or...

423
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,360
maybe with a beautiful slut
which is better than aIone...

424
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,200
Did the Turk leave any of that stuff?

425
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,000
"Dunno" was his name.

426
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,800
Thanks.

427
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,480
If things were always this way...

428
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:44,200
if they took your weapons and left
this stuff, we'd live better, right?

429
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,120
-Come on, come on.
-We're coming.

430
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,920
-You go first.
-No, you go.

431
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
-No, I won't go!
-Go!

432
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,640
You know what Father always said?
"If necessary, float on shit."

433
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,480
-I'd like to see him!
-Ready? One, two, three...

434
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,520
Vassllissa, what about this?

435
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,480
Mine.

436
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,280
-A gun in your kitchen?
-For the enemies.

437
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,840
-May I ask you something?
-What?

438
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,600
I've been waiting to ask you...
No, no, nothing. Never mind.

439
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,520
Go ahead. Go on.

440
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,200
How come you're a...
How come you're... a...

441
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,080
-Prostitute?
-Yes.

442
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,880
My mother was a prostitute.

443
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,680
My grandmother was a prostitute.

444
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,440
My sister's a prostitute.

445
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,320
Logical, isn't it?

446
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,080
LogicaI... logical.

447
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,920
What did you do before?

448
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,800
Where were you?
Why did you come here?

449
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,600
-Here?
-Yes.

450
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:50,280
In Athens I worked with the Germans.
The Germans brought me here.

451
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,080
They left.
I stayed.

452
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,920
The end.

453
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,720
-Do you like it here? Do you want to stay here?
-I don't know.

454
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,520
It's fine here... for now.

455
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,320
But you'll...

456
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:19,080
you'll always, always be...

457
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,920
A prostitute?
I...

458
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,840
I... I don't know.

459
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,640
Maybe I'll open a tavern.

460
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,200
-It's a massacre! Penalty!
-I didn't hurt him!

461
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,040
-Lieutenant, fuck off!
-You fuck off!

462
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,520
Calm down!

463
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,400
Now... it's a penalty.

464
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,320
On two conditions.

465
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,080
First: that you take it.
Second: that I save it.

466
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,560
I'm hypnotizing you!
It's already been saved!

467
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,320
The pepper got you, eh?

468
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,240
Go on!

469
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,120
Kick!

470
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,040
It's been 15 minutes!

471
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,880
I hypnotized you, but...

472
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:42,520
Don't show me where you're aiming for...
I' ve already saved it.

473
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,400
Move away!

474
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,280
What the hell?

475
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,120
My God!

476
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,520
He's Italian. He's one of us.

477
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,040
-Italians?
-Lieutenant RaffaeIe Montini.

478
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,920
Sergeant NicoIa Lo Russo.

479
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:31,480
Lieutenant CarmeIo La Rosa.
Anyway, I saw it. That was no penalty.

480
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:39,120
You are Italian soldiers?

481
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,040
-Aegean?
-I think so.

482
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,840
I had engine trouble, nothing
serious, just a coupling.

483
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,560
I'm headed for Crete. Our division
was united with the British.

484
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,440
-The British??!
-Sure! They have...

485
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,280
some incredible planes! The British
and the Americans are very organized.

486
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,120
British and Americans?
Did you surrender?

487
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,040
Who?

488
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,800
You don't know about anything!
Not even September 8th?

489
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,640
So what? Every year there's
September 8, 9, 1 0...

490
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,560
What about September 8th?

491
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,400
-How long have you been here?
-Since June.

492
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,280
-June of what year?
-'41 .

493
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:29,040
-'41 , '42... '43... Three years?
-What?

494
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,960
You've been here three years?

495
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,760
Hear that? Three years.
He's been here three years!

496
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,640
-We've all been here three years!
-All of you?

497
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,560
We arrived together.

498
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,400
Then you know nothing?
You have no radio, or anything?

499
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,160
-We had one.
-I'll explain it all. Mussolini fell.

500
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,000
Italy is divided. South,
the British and Americans.

501
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,840
North: The Germans and Fascists.
In between the CLN.

502
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,720
-What's the CLN?
- The National Liberation Committee--

503
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,480
the partisans. There's a civil war.

504
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,280
Friends have become enemies,
and vice versa.

505
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,160
There's utter chaos, many
opportunities, and lots to do.

506
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,880
We can't ignore it.
There are big things at stake.

507
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,800
Lots of money to be made.

508
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,640
Done!

509
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,400
-It's fixed.
-And this?

510
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,240
The plane's got too many parts! That
piece is useless. Leave it there.

511
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,880
I'll let headquarters know you're here.
A ship or something might come by.

512
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,720
If you get back, drop in on me in
PaIermo. Bring your women, your wives...

513
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,640
whatever, anybody!

514
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,360
Three years! Hard to believe!
Three years!

515
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,280
Come on! Take me along!
Why can't you?

516
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,800
-Hey, just a minute.
-Take me home!

517
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,640
-Take me home!
-Take it easy! Calm down.

518
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,600
I am calm.

519
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,480
I want to go home.

520
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,320
You could at least have
taken the letters!

521
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,720
It's over.

522
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,520
Soon they'll come for us...

523
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,360
and take us home.

524
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,880
And we won't see each other again.

525
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,760
I don't know how many men
I've been with.

526
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,480
I don't remember any
of their faces.

527
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,200
When you leave, I won't remember...

528
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,120
you, either.

529
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,040
Yes...

530
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,960
Me, you'll remember.

531
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,600
Let's do it?

532
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,320
Why?

533
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,560
-A nice game, right?
-Yes, nice.

534
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,440
-Look who's spoiling everything.
-Mind your own business!

535
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,320
You're just lucky, Pope!

536
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,160
The dice are round, but still...

537
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:18,840
I knew it! I'll never get used to it.
It's like drinking sand.

538
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,560
Let it settle on the bottom.
Learn to wait.

539
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,440
Smell the aroma, and wait.
That's the enjoyment.

540
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:32,240
What are you saying? Coffee is coffee!
You order it, drink it and leave. Shit!

541
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,080
Wait! Everybody waits!
What's there to wait for?

542
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,840
-I'll check it.
-What happened?

543
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,520
-Hi. What happened?
-Farina shot at me.

544
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,440
-What?
-It was my turn.

545
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:58,160
He's inside with her. He wouldn't let
me in. I knocked and knocked...

546
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,960
and started knocking down the door.
He shot at me from the window.

547
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,760
-Is he crazy?
-It seems impossible. What's going on?

548
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,520
-Antonio?
-Go away, all of you! You understand?

549
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,440
Leave us alone.

550
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,160
-He's gone nuts!
-What'll we do? What'll we do?

551
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,080
-Go get RaffaeIe.
-Me?

552
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,000
-Should I go?
-Why me?

553
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,840
-I could go.
-Should he go? Go on!

554
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:33,640
Does it hurt? It must hurt a little.
See? It hurts. Go on!

555
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,440
Go, GaribaIdi! That guy shoots!

556
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,040
-Nino?
-One step closer and I shoot!

557
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,960
Oh, he talks big!

558
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,760
Fuck off, Nino!

559
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,600
-He's real crazy.
-An idiot! Real scary.

560
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,280
-It's true.
-Let's see it. Does it hurt?

561
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,200
It's not serious.

562
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,040
-Just a scratch.
-What the hell got into him?

563
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,800
He's inside with Vassllissa
and won't let anyone in.

564
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,640
-Why?
-He won't respect the scheduled turns.

565
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,560
Talk to him.

566
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,320
Nino! RaffaeIe's here
to see you.

567
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,080
Antonio, what are you doing?

568
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:39,840
Nobody' to touch Vassllissa!
That goes for you too, Lieutenant.

569
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,720
O.K., Antonio, but that's her
line of work.

570
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,520
I mean, she's taken certain
psycho-physical needs to heart...

571
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,320
she's proposing a soIution...

572
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:58,080
-I mean, she's a prostitute.
-Not after today! I love her.

573
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,800
-What?
-I love her, Lieutenant. I love her.

574
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,640
He loves her.

575
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,560
Vassllissa?

576
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,120
Do you love him, too?

577
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,920
Yes.

578
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,560
Boys, that changes everything.
How can we go against feelings?

579
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,440
-We can't?
-What do you say?

580
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,360
We can't.

581
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,200
His feelings shot me in the arm.

582
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,120
Oh, come on, it's not serious.

583
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,920
I have to go back...
The colour is drying up.

584
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,760
Best wishes and lots of male chlldren...
my colour's drying.

585
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,640
Get that disinfected.

586
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:01,400
One guy's colour dries,
another guy's wound dries. Let's go.

587
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,280
Sorry.

588
01:07:52,800 --> 01:08:00,400
Now Vassllissa and Antonio
are man and wife.

589
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,280
Drink to your marriage.

590
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,080
And then you, Antonio,
will break the gIass...

591
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,880
to make sure nothing will
interfere with your happiness.

592
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,640
Italians are like Turks, huh?

593
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,480
One race, one stomach!

594
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,360
Lieutenant.

595
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,240
Where's Noventa?

596
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,160
I don't know.

597
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,080
Know what this reminds me of?

598
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,920
When the vacation was over.

599
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,680
That's when we went back to school.
Vacation was over and we headed home.

600
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:06,480
This atmosphere here reminds
me of that moment.

601
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,240
I wonder if it's right.

602
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,080
The world changes, and we're here.

603
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,880
Right or not, that' how it is.
It's destiny.

604
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,800
Destiny!

605
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,680
Destiny... can be manipuIated...

606
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,480
You can try to have things
go as you'd like.

607
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,400
One can change destiny.

608
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,200
It's not easy. Sometimes
one has to obey destiny.

609
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,040
Did you see that star?

610
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,800
Did you make a wish?

611
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,520
It's not easy.

612
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,000
Know what I'd like?
A nice ship to take me away.

613
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,840
Not that it's bad here. But...

614
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,720
I'm beginning to feeI...

615
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,520
a need for a person. Someone...

616
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,320
to be in love with.

617
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,240
Sergeant, I...

618
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,080
I could be that person.

619
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,760
I'm in love with you.

620
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,040
I don't know how the hell
it happened.

621
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,880
They're British!

622
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,600
-Can we be sure they're friends now?
-Things change.

623
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,800
Italians.

624
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,640
-What did he say? I didn't hear it.
-"Italians".

625
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,520
What the fuck do they want?

626
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,440
Dimitri.

627
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:35,200
Dimitri! They are taLlani, are taLlani.

628
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,800
Who are those guys?

629
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,480
They used to live here.
They're coming home.

630
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,760
Not allowed... not allowed to
take animal on the boat.

631
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,640
He and I, we're together.

632
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,520
And we're going home together.
To Italy.

633
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,360
If he can't go, I won't go either.
I'll stay. I won't move.

634
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,240
Try to move me!

635
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,960
See? A little reasoning...
Come, GaribaIdi.

636
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,800
How much stuff are you taking?

637
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,680
Sergeant...

638
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,560
What is this?

639
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,480
We'll never see each other again?

640
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,360
Not again!
We have the whole ocean trip!

641
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:10,160
Where's Farina?
I can't fucking find him.

642
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,000
-I'll look for him.
-How much stuff are you taking?

643
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,880
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

644
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,720
-Tell me where! They'll leave him here!
-I don't know!

645
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,520
-What's up?
-"What's up?"?

646
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,400
What's up?
What do you want?

647
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,240
What do you mean, ''What's up?"?
Come out and let's go!

648
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,040
I won't come. This is my house.
I'm married... I'm staying here.

649
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,960
Those guys won't wait.

650
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,760
They're British. Your marriage isn't
valid in Italy. Move it! Let's go!

651
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,640
It's valid for me. Very valid.

652
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,520
Bring her too. Let's go!
They won't wait!

653
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,360
Where to?... Where?

654
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:44,200
I have no home, no job. I'm alone.
Why should I leave? No!

655
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,000
Everything's changing. Italy needs
rebuilding from the ground up.

656
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,880
There's much confusion.
It's a great opportunity.

657
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,680
We'll build a great nation,
I promise you. It's also our duty.

658
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,520
What duty? Even you agreed.
Remember?

659
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,360
They forgot about us.
I want to forget them.

660
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:11,120
Rebuild Italy, change the world!
I don't believe it. I can't.

661
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,000
I'm staying here.

662
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,800
In an olive barrel on a deserted island?
Is that your ambition?

663
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,680
I feel alive, here, for the
first time. You understand?

664
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,480
Vassllissa wants to start a
restaurant. She needs me.

665
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,160
Don't be upset, Sergeant.

666
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,000
We're friends, aren't we?

667
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,720
Attendant Farina, this is
desertion, you know that.

668
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,880
-I love you.
-Me too.

669
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,440
I can't believe in it.

670
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,240
An olive?

671
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,160
-I'm not hungry.
-Take one.

672
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,040
I said I'm not hungry.

673
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,920
Farina disappeared competely.

674
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,800
Disappeared. I looked everywhere.

675
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,640
-He must have fled to the mountains!
-Probably.

676
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,520
Maybe he's right.

677
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,240
RaffaeIe, we're going to
build a great nation.

678
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,040
You'll see. He'll come back to live
there, too. You'll see.

679
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,960
Give me an olive.

680
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,760
Italians, Greeks,
my race, my face

681
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,640
one face... one race...

682
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,360
Where did you end up?

683
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,760
RESTAURANT VASSILISSA

684
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,680
Lieutenant!

685
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,480
Antonio, I'm so very sorry.

686
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:04,200
I wasn't sure about the address.
Thank you.

687
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,120
Thanks, Lieutenant.

688
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:23,440
-You've lived here all aIong?
-Yes...

689
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,280
Did you see the restaurant?

690
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,480
I have a surprise for you!

691
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,360
Look who landed here!

692
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,760
Who?

693
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,560
Lo Russo!

694
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,240
Hell! Lieutenant!

695
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,960
Life wasn't so good in Italy.

696
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,760
They didn't let us change anything.

697
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,640
So?

698
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,520
So I told them...

699
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,400
"You win..."

700
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,200
"but don't consider me
your accomplice."

701
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,120
That's what I told them.

702
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,000
And so I came here.

703
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,960
And you? What will you do now?

704
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,560
I'll give you a hand...

705
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,600
DEDICATED TO All THOSE
ARE RUNNING AWAY
