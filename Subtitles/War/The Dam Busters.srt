1
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:55,884
- I've lost it, Daddy. I can't find it.
- I've got it.

2
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,640
- Here it is, Daddy.
- Thank you.

3
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:04,958
Watch it, Christopher.

4
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:10,039
Four, three, two, one, fire!

5
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,443
Fine, that's good!
Mark it, Mary.

6
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,206
Right, well let's...

7
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,557
Hello, old Doc! I'm sorry.
Have you been here long?

8
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,678
No, I've just come.
What all this going on?

9
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,923
Oh, it's... just a little thing
I'm trying to find out.

10
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,437
Here, can you just hold that for me?
Just over the centre of the tub.

11
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,006
Got it?

12
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:35,561
Right, we'll make a note of this one.

13
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:38,440
13 foot 3. That's all right now.
Thank you very much.

14
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,886
- Hello, Doc.
- Hello, darling.

15
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,282
Are you going to look at Elizabeth?
I hope it isn't tonsils.

16
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,045
She looks all right.
Where's your mother?

17
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,646
- ln the house.
- Let's go in, shall we?

18
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,945
- I'll be in in a minute.
Stay for some tea.

19
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:48,122
- Thanks very much.

20
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:51,956
Well, now listen. Let's try to get
one or two more shots before it's too dark.

21
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,280
Thank you.

22
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,045
Watch out, Mary.

23
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,839
Watch it, Christopher.

24
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,118
I don't think there's anything
to worry about here.

25
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:02,760
The temperature is all right.

26
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,957
Quite a lot of these throats
are running around this spring.

27
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:07,237
- She'll be all right in the morning.
- Good.

28
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:10,086
Now, along to bed, darling.
I'll bring you up some supper later on.

29
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,198
Oh, but I've got to help Daddy
play marbles.

30
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,680
No, it's too late now, dear.

31
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,923
- Good night, Doctor.
- Good night, Elizabeth.

32
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,924
All right, let's try one more.

33
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,958
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

34
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:22,043
Three, two, one, fire!

35
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,159
He seems to be having a fine old game
out there.

36
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:26,996
What's it all about?

37
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,766
Just some problem he's trying to solve
before tomorrow afternoon.

38
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,286
He's been at it for days now.

39
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,682
He was out there at 5 o'clock
this morning in the rain.

40
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,117
Doctor, when I called you this afternoon
it wasn't really about Elizabeth.

41
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,124
- It was Barnes.
- You don't think he's well?

42
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,920
He's all right at present,
but he won't be for much longer.

43
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,685
He can't be if he goes on like this:

44
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:46,037
2 and 3 and 4 o'clock
night after night.

45
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,283
And after a hard day
at his real job at Vickers.

46
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,398
He hardly went to bed at all
last night.

47
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:51,755
He's wearing himself out.

48
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:55,118
I wish you'd have a talk with him,
I think he might listen to you.

49
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,124
I'll see what I can do,
but you know how he is.

50
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,722
- How is Elizabeth?
- Oh, she's all right.

51
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,519
- You don't think it's tonsils?
- No, no, no.

52
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:06,322
But I'll keep an eye on her,
don't you worry.

53
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,086
The tea is stone cold, Barnes.
I called you twice.

54
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:12,119
Oh, I'm sorry. But you know
I got a lot of very useful stuff here.

55
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,283
It's only a question now
of working it out on paper.

56
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:17,080
- Another late night?
- I don't know, it depends.

57
00:05:17,207 --> 00:05:19,767
In any case, this part is easy
compared with what's coming.

58
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,923
- Have a cup of tea, Doc.
- Well, if you're going to...

59
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,958
- I'll make some fresh.
- Don't worry, I'll do it.

60
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:26,965
No, no, you sit down
and take off those wet shoes.

61
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,039
- Better see to the blackout first.
- I'll give you a hand.

62
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:36,806
Wait a minute.

63
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,837
Come out here and listen.

64
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,401
Hmm, sound like another big one.

65
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,961
Surely they won't be able to stand up
to many raids like these.

66
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,555
They wouldn't if we could really
get at them, but we don't.

67
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,645
It's like trying to kill a giant
by firing at his arms and legs

68
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:01,283
with thousands of peashooters instead
of a clean bullet through the heart.

69
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:04,524
You know what happened
when they tried to wipe out London.

70
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,797
Here's your tea, Barnes.
Don't let this get cold.

71
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,326
I'm coming.

72
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:23,403
Doc, do you remember about
that earthquake bomb idea of mine?

73
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,643
Yes, that was the time of Dunkerque.

74
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,679
You told me the idea,
but not what you wanted it for.

75
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,558
Come over here.

76
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,486
Do you know how much water it takes
the Germans to make a ton of steel?

77
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,644
- Haven't the least idea.
- One hundred tons.

78
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,200
Now just look at this.

79
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:46,364
The whole of this great arsenal
of war factories in the Ruhr

80
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:49,240
depends for its water
on three enormous dams:

81
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,564
The Möhne,
the Eder and the Sorpe.

82
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:56,316
They control the level of the canals
and supply a lot of hydroelectric power.

83
00:06:56,447 --> 00:07:01,282
When those are full,
they hold 400 million tons of water.

84
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:04,922
Just think of the chaos
if we could break those walls down.

85
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,242
Now, this is what I wanted to do.

86
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,519
Drop a 10 ton bomb
from 40 thousand feet

87
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:15,925
that would seal itself
in the roots of the wall.

88
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:18,402
The shockwaves would be tremendous,
a real earthquake.

89
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,757
But could you hit a target that size
from 8 miles up?

90
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,481
I reckon that a near miss, even 50 feet,
would do the job.

91
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:25,802
Is there an airplane that will carry
a 10 ton bomb?

92
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,122
- No, but i was going to design one.
- What happened?

93
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,807
Well, a committee was set up
and we went into it

94
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:34,636
but I hadn't made sufficient allowance
for the cushioning effect of the water.

95
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:38,316
We should need a 30 ton bomb -
too heavy for any aircraft at present.

96
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:39,675
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.

97
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,082
- Oh, carry on.
- Well, just a little.

98
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,560
Do you know, Barnes?

99
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:47,441
I still don't see why you need
such a special bomb.

100
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:53,838
This dam is about 1 20 feet thick:
Solid masonry all through.

101
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:57,562
We've proved that a bomb 20 times
the size of the biggest bomb now

102
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,120
wouldn't even tickle it.

103
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:01,124
Besides, we can't float anything
down the lake

104
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,637
because they've got these two huge
booms stretching right across it.

105
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,025
We can't even get it
in under the water

106
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:09,283
because these booms
support thick steel nets

107
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,558
which would stop a flotilla of submarines
let alone torpedoes.

108
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,359
I see.

109
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,126
You can't bomb it,
you can't float a mine against it

110
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,965
and you can't torpedo it.

111
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:22,682
- Looks impossible.
- Yes, it does, doesn't it?

112
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:26,117
The other day I thought of a new,
a wonderful idea.

113
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,807
- You've found a way to do it?
- I think so.

114
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,715
The committee that's enquiring into
my original idea is meeting again tomorrow

115
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,725
and I rather expect they'll want
to wind the whole thing up.

116
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,246
Well, if they do, I'm done.

117
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,756
Why don't you go ahead
with your new idea until you're ready

118
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,878
and then get them
to form a new committee?

119
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:45,124
My dear fellow, you talk as if I could pull
committees out of a hat.

120
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:49,445
It took months...well, years almost
to get Whitehall to start this one.

121
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:53,685
Somehow or other I must just keep it alive
until I'm ready.

122
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:59,404
Oh, I'm sorry!
You want to get back to your surgery.

123
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:01,483
Well, I ought to really.

124
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,924
- Barnes?
- Hmm?

125
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,835
- Will you promise me something?
- If I can...

126
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,721
Would you try to get away for Easter?
You do need a rest, you know.

127
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,486
You think I'm going crazy?
A lot of people do, you know.

128
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:21,395
No, but you can't go on day and night.
Nobody can.

129
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,845
All right, Doc.

130
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,243
- Hello, Dr Pye.
- Hello, Wallis.

131
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,403
- Would you do something for me?
- I'll try.

132
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:43,882
You've got a lot of influence
over those fellows in there.

133
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,316
Will you try to stop them
winding the thing up right away?

134
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:49,484
- They'd need a very convincing reason.
- I've got a new idea.

135
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,565
It's quite different
only...l must have time.

136
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,724
- Can you explain to them what it is?
- That's just the point, I can't.

137
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,919
If I were to try explain it to them now
they'd only laugh at me.

138
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,596
- It's difficult without knowing more...
- Yes, I do see that, but...

139
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,605
We'd better go in.

140
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,117
Surely Mr Wallis must realise
the false position he's putting us into.

141
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,363
We were appointed to examine
a definite proposition.

142
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,285
I don't think we were confined
to any definite proposition.

143
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,444
We were appointed to examine every
possibility of air attack on these dams.

144
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,882
I know, but Mr Wallis
did put forward a

145
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:24,197
theory that was hopelessly
wide of the mark.

146
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:29,242
And on the strength of this, he wants time
to explore a completely new theory

147
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,198
that's too fantastic even to explain.

148
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:34,239
I'm only asking for one simple thing:
I want you to give me sufficient time.

149
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,359
To discover how much explosive
would be needed to breach these dams

150
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:40,240
if we could explode a bomb
directly against the wall.

151
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,927
How do you propose to get the bomb
directly against the wall?

152
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:44,162
That is what I'm working on now.

153
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:46,278
Yes, but surely
you can give us some idea.

154
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:48,841
I don't think that we can press Mr Wallis
to do that.

155
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:51,879
If I had a partly formed theory,
I certainly shouldn't want to talk about it

156
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,879
until I'm sure that it is all clear.

157
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:55,760
Quite so.

158
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,640
How long would you need to carry out
these new experiments?

159
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,918
If Glanville will let me have the model
dams at St Harmondsworth again

160
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,845
I would say... a week or ten days.

161
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,925
- How do you feel about that, Glanville?
- We'll be of any help we can.

162
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:12,563
Right. Then I should like to propose
that we formally adjourn for two weeks.

163
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:15,838
Can I take it
that the committee agrees to this?

164
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,400
Splendid!

165
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,637
I'm so glad you could come down.
I think you'll find this very interesting.

166
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:29,237
Glanville's people
have rigged up two charges.

167
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:33,645
This first one is equivalent
to a 10 ton bomb, 50 feet from the wall,

168
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,564
as in the earlier experiments.

169
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:39,965
This second one is only half that charge
but fixed to the wall itself.

170
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,726
Both are at a depth
equivalent to 30 feet.

171
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:45,156
- Are we all ready, Collins?
- All ready, Dr Glanville.

172
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,642
- You want to take cover?
- No, I don't think so.

173
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,246
Not for the first one.

174
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:52,086
If you all stand back over there...

175
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,762
All right, Collins, go ahead!

176
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,880
There. You see?
It isn't even scratched?

177
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,485
A very slight shock is recorded
and then it returns to normal.

178
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:20,040
This is where I was wrong before.

179
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,362
The cushion of water
between the explosion and the wall

180
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:25,160
absorbs the shock almost completely.
Shall we have the second one?

181
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,676
- When you're ready.
- This should get our feet wet.

182
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:30,002
Watch it.

183
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:31,355
Fire.

184
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:40,716
- Good heavens! That's wonderful.
- Wonderful.

185
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,884
And that is only
half the charge of the first one.

186
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:47,044
Do you see the difference when it's placed
against the wall at the right depth?

187
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:51,558
The cushion of water acts in our favour
sending shockwaves right through the wall.

188
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,076
If we use this as a basis,
Glanville and I have calculated

189
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,438
we should one need 6,000 pounds
of this new explosive, RD X,

190
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,920
to breach the Möhne dam itself.

191
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,526
I can cut the case weight down

192
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,877
and make a complete bomb
of less than 5 tons.

193
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,918
We shouldn't need
a specially constructed aircraft either.

194
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:08,756
The new four engine Lancaster can carry
a 5 ton bomb right through to the Ruhr.

195
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,196
- If you can make the bomb...
- Naturally.

196
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,922
And get it to explode exactly in the
right position, hard against the dam wall.

197
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,880
- despite the protecting torpedo nets?
- Of course, that's essential.

198
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,486
But you still don't tell us how.

199
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:21,484
Well, if you're satisfied
with what you've seen

200
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:23,802
and I can have the proper facilities
I think I can do it.

201
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:27,442
- What facilities do you want?
- A testing tank, a really big one.

202
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:30,639
The biggest I know is the experimental
ship tank at Teddington,

203
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:34,237
- the National Physical Laboratory's.
- Could I use one of those?

204
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,005
- I'll see what we can do.
- Uh-huh.

205
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,357
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

206
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,079
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

207
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:43,165
And keep at it.
I think you've got something.

208
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:53,724
Three, two, one...

209
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:54,996
fire!

210
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,717
1 10, 1 36.

211
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,166
Thank you.

212
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,926
That's no good, it's too short.
Try 2 foot 6.

213
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:06,039
Well gentlemen, when you asked us
to let Barnes Wallis use this tank of ours

214
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,283
I didn't expect him to be still here
after five months.

215
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:09,965
I don't think we did either.

216
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,521
We have urgent experiments
waiting for this tank.

217
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,366
Any idea how long he's going to be?
It's making things very difficult.

218
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,923
He's exploring something entirely new,
you can't hurry this kind of research.

219
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,878
I know and if I thought
he was getting anywhere...

220
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:24,238
But he doesn't seem to be doing so.
At any rate, he doesn't tell me anything.

221
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,961
He spends hours and hours
shooting golf balls up and down.

222
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,884
And every now and then,
he breaks a window.

223
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:32,522
Look, couldn't you find him
some quiet duck pond in the country

224
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:36,083
where he could shoot things up and down
without being a nuisance to other people?

225
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,163
We'd better have a word with him.
Is he there now?

226
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,006
He's always there.
Didn't go home at all last night.

227
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,357
- Why was that?
- I don't know, I think he forgot.

228
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,603
He only has lunch
about once a week.

229
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,484
All right. Stand by!
Once again.

230
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:56,486
Three, two, one...

231
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:57,517
fire!

232
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:02,365
It's OK, I got that all right.

233
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:05,126
1 5 0 2 0 3.

234
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,363
Splendid! We'll try that again.

235
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,400
Oh, hello.
Hello.

236
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,199
You couldn't have come
at a better time.

237
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,199
It's extraordinary
how these things happen.

238
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:19,524
One goes on and on feels as if
one's up against a brick wall forever

239
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:23,003
and then suddenly, it's as if a light
flashes on and everything slips into place.

240
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,243
And now...

241
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,676
If you come along here...

242
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,799
I've got a camera recording
but I think that up by the middle

243
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:32,918
you'll see everything perfectly.

244
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,758
All right.
Er, just about where you are.

245
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,035
Are you all ready?

246
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,395
Once again.

247
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,076
Right.

248
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,926
Three, two, one...

249
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,878
fire!

250
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,763
1 4 0...

251
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,684
We've been trying for months
to find a rule

252
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:09,116
by which we can fix
the height of each bounce.

253
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:11,203
If the bomb is released too soon,
it won't reach the dam,

254
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:13,318
if it's released too late,
it'll bounce over it

255
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:15,756
and explode directly under the aircraft
killing everyone.

256
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:19,880
But now, we've got it! If you just wait
here a moment and I'll do that again.

257
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,199
Right.

258
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:26,080
Three, two, one..

259
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,606
Fire!

260
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,684
You see? It wasn't a fluke,
it works.

261
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,718
Well, that seems to be conclusive.

262
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:37,315
It's extraordinarily good of you
to have been so patient.

263
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,005
Not at all, glad we could help.

264
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:41,083
There were times when you must have
thought I was absolutely cockeyed.

265
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,880
- My dear fellow, that's the last thing...
- I shouldn't blame you if you did.

266
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:48,239
There's such a very thin dividing line
between inspiration and obsession

267
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,517
that sometimes is very hard to know
which side we're on.

268
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,239
- Will you need the tank anymore?
- If I could have it

269
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,722
until the end of the week to check
my calculations and complete the report.

270
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,917
That's perfectly all right.
You'll leave on Saturday?

271
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,116
Oh, yes, definitely.

272
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:01,125
After what you've seen today,
you'll put in a satisfactory report.

273
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:03,317
Certainly. I think this
ought to convince the committee.

274
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,436
Splendid!

275
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,320
After that, it's a matter
for the Ministry of Aircraft Production.

276
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:11,042
Under normal conditions, we should go
right ahead and give you every facility.

277
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,203
But I'm afraid at the present moment,
it's quite impossible.

278
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,806
But why, after that report?

279
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:17,202
You know how difficult things are,
Mr Wallis.

280
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,285
The shipping losses: half a million tons
last month alone,

281
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,523
most of it vital war material.

282
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,320
We haven't got an ounce to spare
for anything except the highest priority.

283
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:28,837
Bit surely, I only want to make a few
half size dummy prototypes of my bomb.

284
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:31,435
A new weapon like this
would need highly skilled labour,

285
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,797
special machine tools,
factory space.

286
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,680
Our factories are stretched
to the last inch of their capacity.

287
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,763
And you know the acute shortage
of skilled labour.

288
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:40,525
But you're making
new weapons all the time.

289
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:43,036
We're always trying to improve
upon weapons of known value.

290
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,522
It's a different matter when we come
to revolutionary ideas,

291
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,603
I might almost say fantastic ones,
like this.

292
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,127
You mustn't think
we're unimaginative or lukewarm.

293
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:53,317
We all see the possibilities
and we'd like to go ahead.

294
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,156
But at present, I'm afraid it's out of
the question. Possibly next year.

295
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,562
For goodness sake,
let's go as far as we can now

296
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,803
even if it doesn't go beyond
these half size prototypes.

297
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,838
You could practically make those
in a bicycle shop.

298
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,958
Even if we made a few dummy bombs,

299
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,317
you say you need a Wellington bomber
for test drops.

300
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,085
They're worth their weight in gold.

301
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:12,767
Do you really think the authorities
would lend you one?

302
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,355
What possible argument could
I put forward to get you Wellington?

303
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,204
Well, if you tell them that I designed it,
do you think that might help?

304
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,757
Looks a bit choppy down there.

305
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:43,398
Smooth or choppy, it's all the same
with this bomb, Mutt.

306
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:49,602
- Ready?
- Yes.

307
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:57,762
How is the speed, Mutt?

308
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,041
Set at 180.

309
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,964
Are we all right for height?

310
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,804
We're all right. Bet you half a crown
it doesn't work anyhow.

311
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,596
Look!

312
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,923
It's all right, it works!

313
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,240
Oh!

314
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,123
Well, I imagine with the
success of the trials,

315
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,239
they'll let me go right
ahead with the real thing.

316
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,323
Personally, I'd like to see you
go straight ahead,

317
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,915
but the position is more difficult today
than it was last month.

318
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,036
How so?

319
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,362
We can't even produce enough of
existing types of bombs,

320
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,165
much less begin to
work on something

321
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,843
completely new and
completely unpredictable.

322
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:11,118
Surely they must realise if we can burst
those dams and flood the Ruhr valley

323
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:14,284
they can save the thousands of bombs
that they're dropping on the factories.

324
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:17,797
I can only pass on to you
the decision of the Ministry, Mr Wallis.

325
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,203
It might help if you could get the support
of somebody with personal influence.

326
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:22,806
Whom do you suggest?

327
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:24,440
Why not go and see
Sir Edward Hughes?

328
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,159
I've seen him twice.

329
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:30,166
- Or Sir George Burnett?
- I've seen him three times.

330
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,403
Well then of course
there's Lord Mansell.

331
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:34,342
I sat outside his office
all yesterday morning.

332
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:36,156
He was too busy.

333
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:39,199
Oh... Well, why not see
Sir Geoffrey Haines?

334
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:41,244
- I sat outside his
office all the afternoon.

335
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:43,161
- I see.

336
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:47,246
Well, in that case for the present I think
you've done everything you possibly can.

337
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,663
- Have you seen Mr Summers?

338
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,199
- I think you'll find him
in the testing shed.

339
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:55,760
Right.

340
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:13,478
- How did you get on?
- It's hopeless.

341
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:14,676
- What happened?
- Nothing.

342
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,798
I walked up and down Whitehall,
in and out of offices,

343
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,236
up and down stairs,
sat outside rooms, l...

344
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:23,155
I felt like a pedlar
trying to sell clockwork toys.

345
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:24,766
I wish there was something
I could do.

346
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:26,684
- There is, Mutt.
- What?

347
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,923
Let's take the whole thing
straight to Bomber Command.

348
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:31,641
- Harris?
- Yes. You really know him.

349
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:37,000
If he sees the films and gets interested,
well, it'll only need one word from him.

350
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:38,560
Why not?

351
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,997
There's a bit of a snag there.

352
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:44,721
You see, he gets so inundated
with fantastic inventions...

353
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,315
That's ridiculous! Everything he's using
had to be invented.

354
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:50,678
Look, if you tell him that it's worthwhile
he'll listen to you, won't he?

355
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:55,642
I'll do what I can, but don't blame me
if he throws us both out of the window.

356
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:15,122
Will you come in, please?

357
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,963
Mr Summers
and Mr Barnes Wallis, sir.

358
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,726
- Hello, Mutt. Wallis.
- Good morning.

359
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:25,882
What is it you want?

360
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:28,986
I've got an idea for
destroying the Ruhr dams.

361
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,045
The effect on Germany
would be enormous.

362
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,806
I know all that, I read the report.

363
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:37,397
But you really think you can knock down
a dam with that thing?

364
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:39,245
Yes.

365
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:43,485
It looks clever enough on paper,
but that goes for all these wizzy ideas.

366
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:46,838
You try to make them work,
they fall down flat.

367
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,162
- This one doesn't.
- How do you know?

368
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,624
We've tested it and proved it.

369
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,960
I've got some films here
I'd like you to see.

370
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,840
If you've proved the thing,
why hasn't it been taken up?

371
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,800
I don't know. But the films
only take five minutes to run.

372
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:02,646
You could see them
and decide for yourself.

373
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,756
Well...

374
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:06,916
all right.

375
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,879
Send the projectionists
out of the room.

376
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:14,124
If this thing is as good as you say,
there's no point in letting everybody know.

377
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:16,397
Thornby can run the film.

378
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:30,360
- Is that you, Barnes?
- Hello.

379
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:35,040
It's raining a bit, I shouldn't
be surprised if it turns to snow.

380
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:39,080
Yes, it is cold, isn't it?
How did you get on?

381
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,243
With Harris? Oh, he was all right.

382
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,119
What's he like?
Is he very fierce?

383
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:47,206
Oh, no. He listened to what I had to say
and saw the films.

384
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,842
- Was he interested?
- Yes, I think so.

385
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:53,765
It doesn't make any difference now anyway
because the whole thing is over.

386
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:55,718
Washed out and done with.

387
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:58,805
That's impossible.
What happened?

388
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:03,717
When I got back to Weybridge, they sent for
me and told that the people in Whitehall

389
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:05,678
had decided that I was making
a nuisance of myself

390
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:09,117
wasting everybody's time, including my own
and that the whole thing was dropped.

391
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,317
What did you do?

392
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,677
Well, the only thing I could do:
I resigned.

393
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,719
- Resigned? From Vickers?
- Mm-hm.

394
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:20,078
Surely this doesn't affect
your other work.

395
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:26,521
Sweetheart, when you believe in a thing
as much as I have believed in this

396
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:30,242
there really isn't any other work
until you have seen it through.

397
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,278
What will you do?

398
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:36,160
Oh, I haven't thought about that yet.

399
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:40,803
It's a new experience
to find myself unemployed.

400
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:42,725
The first thing you'll
do is to have a rest.

401
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:44,522
We'll get away somewhere.

402
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,480
No, I don't think so. It wouldn't
be much fun in a farm house in winter

403
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:50,565
or in some dreary wartime hotel.

404
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:53,201
There's plenty to do here too.

405
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:57,081
I must see about the tool-house door,
see if I can get it to work properly.

406
00:24:57,207 --> 00:25:01,041
I've meaning to repair the chicken run
for years.

407
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,727
After that, I can look around
for someway of earning a living.

408
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,281
I suppose I can get a job
teaching somewhere.

409
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:08,762
Oh, a secretary rang up
just before you got in.

410
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:11,355
The Ministry of Aircraft Production
want to see you in the morning.

411
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:15,366
I've had enough of the Ministry of Aircraft
Production and all the rest of them.

412
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,160
- But they said it was important.
- Yes, it is to them.

413
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:21,563
They'd enjoy giving me a lecture
on minding my own business.

414
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,565
Personally, I'd prefer to dig the garden.

415
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,638
If it doesn't snow,
I think I'll put in a few broad beans.

416
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:31,883
- Isn't it a bit too early?
- I don't know. They're very hardy.

417
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,237
One year I planted a row in November

418
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,120
and they come up a couple of inches
by Christmas.

419
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,962
I think you ought to go, Barnes.

420
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,276
Perhaps you're right.

421
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:47,825
It would be a good thing
if I told them exactly

422
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:50,242
what I think of the
whole bunch of them.

423
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,202
Mr Wallis, sir.

424
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:59,797
Oh, hello, Wallis. I was trying all over
the place to get hold of you yesterday.

425
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,702
- You needn't have troubled.

426
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:03,476
- What do you mean, I
needn't have troubled?

427
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,325
They told me the news at Vickers.

428
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,444
If you've got to tell
me officially, well...

429
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:09,440
I suppose you've got
to have your say.

430
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,205
Then I'll have mine.

431
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:12,806
But they know nothing
about it yet.

432
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:14,285
The news only came through
in the afternoon.

433
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,967
And actually I wanted you
to be the first to know.

434
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,521
- What did they told you?
- That the whole thing was off.

435
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,921
Done with, finished.

436
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:24,005
I don't know who said that,
it didn't come from us.

437
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:26,163
What I'm telling you now is official.

438
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:29,836
Orders have just come through from Downing
Street that it's to go ahead right away.

439
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,276
The Prime Minister is
enthusiastic about it.

440
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:33,999
The time is the vital element now.

441
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:37,358
The dams must be attacked early in May
when the water level is at its highest.

442
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:38,920
After that the level begins to drop.

443
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,197
Naturally, I know that.
I made it clear in my report.

444
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:45,081
It only leaves a bare two months
to train a squadron and prepare the bombs.

445
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:48,677
Can you do your part in that time?

446
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:55,882
Well...I'll do my best.

447
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:01,678
That's how it is. I expect you all
want to get back to your groups.

448
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:06,835
I want a maximum effort tonight.
See if we can get a real knock at Essen.

449
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,320
Right.

450
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:14,877
Cochrane, don't go for a minute.

451
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:21,279
What do you think of Wallis' idea
of bursting the Ruhr dams?

452
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,558
It sounds a bit far-fetched,
but personally I think it can be done.

453
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:26,120
I hope you're right.

454
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:30,763
Anyway, I've given it my support
and I've had orders to get ready.

455
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,560
- I want you to take it on.
- Right, sir, I'd like to.

456
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:36,155
It'll mean taking a squadron out
of the line for special training.

457
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,484
No, we must form
a special squadron for this

458
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:44,681
and man it with experienced crews who've
just finished their present 30 trips.

459
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:47,560
Some of those keen youngsters
won't mind doing an extra one.

460
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:50,155
Have you anyone in mind
to command the squadron?

461
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:52,403
Yes. Gibson.

462
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,240
Rad shutters auto.

463
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,644
Rad shutters auto.

464
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:36,565
- Brakes off.
- Brakes off.

465
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,244
Nigger, come on, boy!
Come on!

466
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,880
Come on, Nigger!

467
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:07,862
Come on, old fellow.

468
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:09,716
You won't have to wait
for me for a long time.

469
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,441
No, you won't!
Going on holiday, down to Cornwall.

470
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,046
Rabbits. Rabbits, boy!

471
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,556
Come on, Skipper,
you'll miss the bus.

472
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:19,121
OK! Come on, Nigger.

473
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:21,044
Come on, boy!

474
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,123
There's a show called "Let's Face it!"
at the Hippodrome.

475
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:38,203
- That's the Cole Porter musical.
- You've seen it?

476
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:41,763
Yeah, I saw it last fall.
But I'll see it again.

477
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,879
"Full Swing" at the Palace
with Jack Halbert.

478
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:47,646
Can you walk straight in on these shows
nowadays or do you have to book?

479
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:50,486
You can't get into the stalls
because of the Americans.

480
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:52,677
Most nights you can get in somewhere.

481
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:54,718
There's four of us for London,
Skipper.

482
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:57,645
We can get the 3:15 tomorrow
and see a show before we split up.

483
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,383
- All right, you
can count me in.

484
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:00,998
- We'll have a couple
of taxis here at 2:30.

485
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:03,322
Excuse me, sir. There's a message
for you from Group.

486
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,802
The A.O.C. would like to see
you at 11 o'clock tomorrow.

487
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:07,838
Oh...right.

488
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,006
You wait there, old boy.
Stay there.

489
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,756
Wing Commander Gibson, sir.

490
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:35,204
- Good morning, Gibson.
- Good morning, sir.

491
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,124
Congratulations on the bar
to your DSO.

492
00:30:37,247 --> 00:30:38,236
Thank you, sir.

493
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,164
- You finished your third tour last night?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:43,245
Would you be prepared
to take on one more trip?

495
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,005
What kind of trip, sir?

496
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:47,083
I can't tell you much about it
for the present

497
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:50,040
But it'll be a special one
and you'll command the operation.

498
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,203
I'm afraid it would mean putting off
your leave.

499
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,045
How do you feel about it?

500
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,123
- All right, sir.
- Good.

501
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:58,078
It's going to need careful training

502
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,562
and the Commander-in-Chief
wants a special squadron formed.

503
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,405
It will be best if you form it yourself.

504
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:07,203
I'm telling all the squadrons they'll have
to give up their most experienced crews.

505
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:09,477
They're not going to like it.

506
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:13,282
- Is Group Captain Whitworth there?
- He's just arrived, sir.

507
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:15,318
- Ask him to come in.
- Very good, sir.

508
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:20,117
What kind of training is it to be, sir?
What sort of target?

509
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:22,397
I can't tell you the target yet.

510
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:24,518
But it will be low-flying.

511
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:28,959
You've got to be able to low-fly at night
until it's second nature.

512
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,486
- Hello, Whitworth.
- Good morning, sir.

513
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,404
- You know each other?
- Oh, yes. We're old friends.

514
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:33,516
- Hello, Gibson.
- Hello, sir.

515
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,525
You'll be forming this squadron
at Whitworth's main base at Scampton.

516
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,239
I'm sorry I can't tell you any more,

517
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,439
but the immediate job is to get
your crews and get them flying.

518
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,683
There's one other thing:
You'll have to watch security.

519
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:47,117
As far as others are concerned,
this is just an ordinary new squadron.

520
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:48,236
Very good, sir.

521
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,916
Now go off with Group Captain Whitworth
and he'll help you to get things going.

522
00:31:57,007 --> 00:31:59,646
You'll find pretty well
everyone that matters in here, sir.

523
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:04,761
- On this board or here, in these albums.
- Right, thank you.

524
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:06,923
Now then... Oh, thanks.

525
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,124
I'd go for these Australians if I were you:
Les Knight and Mickey Martin.

526
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:13,602
Martin knows all there is to know
about low-flying.

527
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:16,195
Yes, I met him
when he was collecting a DFC.

528
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:19,876
I know this New Zealander, Les Munro,
I'd like to have him.

529
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:23,363
- And Joe McCarthy, he's great.
- Oh, the American. The Glorious Blonde.

530
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:25,876
He used to be
a Coney Island beach guard.

531
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,918
We mustn't forget the English.

532
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:34,355
Here is Bill Astell.

533
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:37,240
Oh yes, and David Maltby.

534
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:41,044
No, he's just started another tour.

535
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,203
And Hoppy Hopgood
from my old squadron.

536
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:45,557
I'd like to have Dave Shannon
and Burpee from there too.

537
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:47,803
We shan't be popular
with the other squadron commanders

538
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,883
if we start squeezing
chaps like these from them.

539
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:51,241
There are two I'd like
as flight commanders:

540
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:52,475
Henry Maudslay and Dinghy Young.

541
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:54,438
- Do you know them?
- I know Young well.

542
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,762
I told him to fly
in the Oxford University Air Squadron.

543
00:32:56,887 --> 00:33:00,277
He was a rowing blue.
Henry Maudslay's a darn good athlete too.

544
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:03,365
He's a miler, I think.
You couldn't have picked two better chaps.

545
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:06,559
- What about your own crew?
- They're off on leave this afternoon.

546
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:09,042
They've had a hard tour and must be
sick of the sight of me by now.

547
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,600
I'll leave them alone.

548
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:23,760
Come on, Nigger.

549
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:27,558
Hurry up, Skipper,
you'll miss the train.

550
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,279
You fellows go ahead,
I shan't be coming.

551
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,159
- Why? What happened?
- Nothing much.

552
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:33,084
- They've given me another job.
- A staff job?

553
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:37,200
- No, forming a new squadron.
- What? Not before your leave?

554
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:38,316
Yeah...

555
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,081
You tell the boys, will you Trevor?

556
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:46,165
You chaps will have to hurry
if you're going to get the 3:15.

557
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,044
You needn't bother about that, Crosby.

558
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,759
- I'm not going.
- Not going, sir?

559
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:03,879
No, but you needn't unpack everything again
because we're moving to Scampton.

560
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:06,202
- You go and get your dinner.
- Very good, sir.

561
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,276
What are messing about for?
I told you, I'm not going.

562
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:17,956
Skipper, this new squadron...
Are you going to fly with it?

563
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,840
- Of course I'm going to fly with it.
- Well, you'll need a crew, won't you?

564
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,525
Of course, but I'll get one all right.

565
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:24,763
Ooh, you mean you've had enough of us.
You want to get rid of us.

566
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,559
I didn't say that.

567
00:34:26,687 --> 00:34:28,439
Well, we've just had
a committee meeting.

568
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,717
There's a general opinion
that it's not going to be safe

569
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:34,123
to let you fly about with a lot of new
people who don't know how crazy you are.

570
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:37,717
It's the general opinion
that you'll need us to look after you.

571
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:41,442
Well...if that's what you want to do,
all right.

572
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:45,196
I think you're the crazy ones.
The whole bunch of you.

573
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,561
Two more beers, please.

574
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:15,037
There's eleven DFCs already
and three bars.

575
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,123
You can bet your boots
it's something big.

576
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:20,319
They say it's a special squadron
to kidnap Hitler.

577
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:24,281
- Who's that big dark fellow by the table?
- That's Young, Gibson's second in command.

578
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:27,046
Dinghy Young, they call him,
because he always comes down in the sea.

579
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,237
And paddles home
in his rubber boat.

580
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:34,441
Oi! Here's Gibson.
He's done 1 7 3 sorties already.

581
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,676
Stay there, Nigger.
Stay there, boy.

582
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:42,481
You know most of the chaps,
I think.

583
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,881
All right, carry on, please.

584
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:45,918
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Dinghy.

585
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:49,121
- McCarthy, sir.
- Oh yes, of course. Glad you're with us.

586
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,159
Hello, Maudslay. You two chaps are going
to be my flight commanders.

587
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,482
- What's it all about, sir?
- You'll find out, sooner or later.

588
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,075
- You've met Mickey Martin, haven't you?
- Yes, of course. Hello, Mickey.

589
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:58,526
I wanted you for this.

590
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,842
You're the low-flying expert.
You'll be able to tell us all about it.

591
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,241
Low-flying? Fine.

592
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:04,881
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Hoppy. Hello, Shannon.

593
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:06,759
I found Nigger outside.
Can I stand him a beer?

594
00:36:06,887 --> 00:36:08,639
Don't give him
more than a pint.

595
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,756
Right.

596
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,845
Don't drink it too quickly
or you'll get hiccups.

597
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,836
Well, sir...when are we
going to get something to fly in?

598
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,878
They're sending the first batch
of Lancs tomorrow.

599
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,922
That makes the ten they promised us
to get started with.

600
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:42,436
Have them flown and tested tomorrow.

601
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,116
We can begin this afternoon
dividing the crews into flights.

602
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,102
The first job will be
to fly over every big

603
00:36:48,103 --> 00:36:49,956
lake in England and Wales
and photograph them.

604
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:52,123
- Lakes?
- Lakes.

605
00:36:52,247 --> 00:36:55,557
- The crews are in the briefing room, sir.
- All right, I'll come.

606
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:15,516
Right, you can sit down.

607
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:23,203
Well...here we are all together
for the first time.

608
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,124
You're wondering what it's all about

609
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,715
and I can't tell you
because I don't know myself.

610
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:29,439
But I do know it's a big thing.

611
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,865
And if it comes off,
it will have results

612
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,163
that may do quite a bit
to shorten this war.

613
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:37,006
Discipline is going to be essential.

614
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,685
So is security.

615
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,446
It's unusual for a crowd like you
to be formed into a new squadron

616
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,683
so you're going to be talked about.

617
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:46,037
Rumours are flying about already

618
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,397
but you have got to keep your mouths shut!

619
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,500
All here will depend on secrecy.

620
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:56,645
If we can surprise them,
then we'll play hell with them.

621
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,997
But if they're ready for us,

622
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:02,199
then the hell is going to come
from the other side.

623
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:06,161
Now I understand that the job,
whatever it is,

624
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,403
has got to be done at low level.

625
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:13,722
So the first thing
is to practise low-flying

626
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:16,680
day and night until we can do it
with our eyes shut.

627
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:54,443
Come in.

628
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,517
- Hello, Mutt.
- This is Wing Commander Guy Gibson.

629
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:01,677
Oh, good morning.
I'm glad you've come.

630
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,798
- My name is Barnes Wallis.
- Morning, sir.

631
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,679
Well, I'll leave you to it.
See you later.

632
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,763
- Right. Thanks.
- Thanks a lot, Mutt.

633
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,003
Would you like to put those things down?
Give me that.

634
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:11,606
Thank you.

635
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:15,075
I don't smoke but there's sometimes
have a cigarette in here...

636
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:17,118
- Yes, there we are.
- Thank you.

637
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:22,842
Well, I don't suppose you know
very much about all this at present.

638
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,719
I don't know anything
about anything yet.

639
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:28,635
- But you know the target.
- No, not the faintest idea.

640
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:32,362
My dear boy... Well, I thought
they would have told you.

641
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:33,886
This makes it very awkward.

642
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:35,884
Isn't that what I'm here for,
to be told by you?

643
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,567
Oh no, not the target.
That's dreadfully secret.

644
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:42,316
I'm afraid I can't tell anybody
whose name isn't on this list.

645
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:46,076
Still, I'll tell you as much as I dare.

646
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:49,358
Well you see, there are certain objects
in the enemy territory

647
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:53,241
that are very big and quite vital
to this war effort.

648
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,439
They're so big that ordinary bombs
won't hurt them.

649
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:59,684
But I've got an idea
for a special type of bomb

650
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,241
only it would have to be dropped
at very low level.

651
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,085
Oh, they've told us about low-flying.

652
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:06,277
Oh, they have?
Oh, well that's something.

653
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:10,041
Well, I don't know
if you're scientifically minded...

654
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:12,522
In any case, it wouldn't be necessary
for you or any of your crews

655
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:14,842
to understand the theory
and mathematics of the weapon.

656
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,605
I'd like to try and understand it
if I can.

657
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:19,757
You would?
Oh, splendid.

658
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:22,117
I'll explain it all to you later
on paper.

659
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:24,044
But first of all,
I'd like you to see some films.

660
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,920
You can leave your things here,
it's only in the next room.

661
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:28,480
Ready?

662
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,439
Right, this way.

663
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:37,726
- Er, are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

664
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:40,315
Bring up a couple of chairs.

665
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:48,322
Right.

666
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:52,360
Now these are the first dropping tests
at Chesil Beach, near Weymouth.

667
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,118
Here comes the Wellington.

668
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:58,717
Mutt Summers is the pilot
and I'm working the release gear.

669
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:01,566
Now in a moment, you'll see the bomb.

670
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:05,486
There it goes...
Now watch.

671
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,403
Now we switch to one of the big
testing tanks at Teddington.

672
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:27,758
These pictures were taken much earlier,
when I was experimenting with miniatures

673
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:30,640
but they show
what the bomb does underwater.

674
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,359
There it goes.

675
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:38,759
Now that's exactly how a full size bomb
would behave.

676
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:43,244
At 30 feet down, an hydrostatic pistol
would automatically explode the charge.

677
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:50,123
Well, you can see now why this low-flying
is so important.

678
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:52,124
Each aircraft will only be able
to carry one bomb

679
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:56,684
and it must be dropped from exactly 150
feet at a speed of 240 miles an hour.

680
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:00,686
Above or below that height and speed
and it just doesn't work.

681
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:02,525
Take a chair, won't you?

682
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:08,566
I'm sorry, we're tied so closely, but it's
all a question of gravity and mathematics.

683
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,342
I'm afraid I'm asking
a great deal of you.

684
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:14,196
Do you think you can fly
it to those limits?

685
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,363
Well, it's hard to say off hand.

686
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,443
The altimeter does no good
at that level

687
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:21,558
but they've given me
some of the best pilots in the Air Force.

688
00:42:21,687 --> 00:42:23,166
So we'll see what we can do.

689
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,879
Have you tested the full size bomb yet?

690
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:28,238
No, it's being assembled now.
I hope to try it in a week or ten days.

691
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:30,963
Do you really mean
that a five ton bomb

692
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:32,964
can bounce along the water
like a ping-pong ball?

693
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,122
It's been hard to persuade some people
that it will

694
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:39,239
but I've every reason to believe it will
behave exactly like those miniatures.

695
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,437
How far from the target
do we drop the bomb?

696
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:46,357
Ah, that's the third factor that I'm afraid
requires absolute accuracy.

697
00:42:46,487 --> 00:42:50,958
I've got a little more work to do on it
but I think it'll be 600 yards.

698
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:54,079
Did you invent this thing
out of your own head?

699
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:57,722
Well...yes...
I think I may say I invented it.

700
00:42:57,847 --> 00:42:59,724
Well I think it's terrific.

701
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:02,105
I thought so at one time,
but I'm beginning to

702
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:04,363
think that the job of
inventing it was small

703
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:06,443
compared with the job of dropping it.

704
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,044
Well, we'll do our best.

705
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,601
I'm talking right in the dark at present.

706
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:13,206
If only I knew what the target was...

707
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:18,443
Yes... Well, I've told you
as much as I dare.

708
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:21,482
I hope they'll tell you the rest
when you get back.

709
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:23,757
Well, Gibson, there it is.

710
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,845
That's your main target:
The Möhne dam.

711
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,925
So that's it.
I thought it was going to be the Tirpitz.

712
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:32,186
If you can blow a hole
in this wall, you'll

713
00:43:32,187 --> 00:43:34,325
bring the Ruhr steel
industry to a standstill

714
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:36,438
and do much other damage besides.

715
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:37,636
I'm showing you the targets

716
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:40,235
but you'll be the only man in the squadron
who knows, so... keep it that way.

717
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,356
Very good, sir.

718
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:45,002
These are the models of the two other dams:
The Eder and the Sorpe.

719
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:47,163
- But the Möhne is the most important.
- I see, sir.

720
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:49,118
Come along and study these
as often as you like.

721
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:51,681
We're having regular reconnaissance
to see what they're doing over there

722
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:53,365
and watch the height of the water.

723
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:55,876
The operation must be carried out
when the lakes are full.

724
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:57,804
When is that likely to be, sir?

725
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,805
About the middle of May.
We'll need a good moon as well,

726
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:04,203
so it looks as though we're tied
to a night between the 12th and 17th.

727
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:06,062
By the time the next full
moon comes around the

728
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,797
water level will have
started to fall again

729
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:11,920
so that's our only chance this year,
about five weeks from now.

730
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:13,321
How's the training going?

731
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:15,358
Oh, pretty well, sir.
Except for the low-flying.

732
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:18,047
- I guessed you'd be in trouble over that.
- It's fairly easy by day,

733
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,920
but night-flying over water at 150 feet
is pretty near impossible.

734
00:44:21,047 --> 00:44:23,561
- You can't trust your altimeter?
- Not at the limits that Mr Wallis wants.

735
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:26,838
He was very emphatic about flying
at 150 feet exactly.

736
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:29,003
I'd hoped we could get over it by practice

737
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,799
but on still nights,
when the water is smooth,

738
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:33,316
there's a sort of a no man's land
between the dusk and the water.

739
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:37,326
I've got the Farnborough experts on that.
I hope they'll come along with an idea.

740
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:39,881
Wallis is going to test
the full size bomb at Reculver tomorrow.

741
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:41,122
I'd like you to go down and watch

742
00:44:41,247 --> 00:44:42,805
- Take your bombing leader with you.
- Right, sir.

743
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:48,401
Can I see your passes, please?

744
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:50,996
Thank you.

745
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:06,125
- Hello, Gibson.
- Hello, sir.

746
00:45:06,247 --> 00:45:08,158
This is Bob Hay, my bombing leader.

747
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:11,279
I'm sorry to drag you here so early.
We had to catch the high tide.

748
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:12,806
It goes right out here,

749
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:15,077
so when it's low we can wade in
and find the bombs

750
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:17,084
and see how they stand up
to the shock of impact.

751
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:19,163
- Have you started yet?
- Yes, we've dropped two already.

752
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:20,845
How did they go?

753
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:24,516
Erm, not too well, I'm afraid
the casing broke. We're testing another.

754
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:27,161
Well, they're due now, any minute.

755
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:36,084
Here it comes.

756
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,720
It's broken again.

757
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:03,476
I'm sorry to bring you all the way here
to see that.

758
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:06,997
There's no need to worry,
I'll get it right.

759
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:09,436
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I shall have to strengthen the casing.

760
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,637
- I'll begin work at once.
- Well, how long will it take?

761
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,787
A few days.
When the tide's out, we'll

762
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:15,806
collect the fragments
and see what happened.

763
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:18,405
I said all along it wouldn't work.

764
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,802
I'm afraid you must think me
rather a fraud.

765
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,916
Not at all, sir.

766
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:24,117
But you know, things nearly always
happen like that first

767
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:26,807
- when you're trying something new.
- Yes, I'm sure they do.

768
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:28,662
- How are you getting
on with the low-flying?

769
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:30,397
- It's awfully hard
to get accuracy,

770
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:33,564
I mean, to within a few feet -
especially at night over water.

771
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:36,645
- Still we'll find some way of doing it.
- Yes, yes, it must be very difficult.

772
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:38,405
Bomb aiming is another headache, sir.

773
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:41,087
The ordinary bombsight isn't
accurate enough at such a low level.

774
00:46:41,207 --> 00:46:44,404
And you want the aircraft to drop that bomb
dead at the same spot, one after the other.

775
00:46:44,527 --> 00:46:46,245
Yes, yes, within a few feet.

776
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,722
We'll look after our own headaches
and leave you to look after yours.

777
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,127
I'm afraid that's all
we can do at present.

778
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:51,407
Oh, I should get it right
within a few days.

779
00:46:51,527 --> 00:46:55,122
- You must try and come down again.
- I'd like to, sir.

780
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:57,158
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

781
00:46:57,287 --> 00:47:00,518
- And to those boys of yours.
- Thanks.

782
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:16,079
The tide is going out, I must wade in
and collect some of the pieces.

783
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:18,801
- Can we help?
- Oh, no, no. I'm used to it.

784
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:21,202
I just feel about in the mud with my toes.

785
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:24,239
Sometimes I get a bit of bomb,
sometimes it's cockles.

786
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:59,766
How are we going to fly at a level
of 150 feet in the dark?

787
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:00,922
That's what I want to know.

788
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:04,278
Maybe if we left a navigator down
on the end of a 150 foot wire:

789
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:07,080
When he calls out,
we'll know we're too low!

790
00:48:07,207 --> 00:48:09,960
No bombsight that works at low level,
a bomb that falls to bits,

791
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:14,000
no way of flying at 150 feet
and the raid, at all costs, in five weeks.

792
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:15,685
Otherwise, everything's marvelous.

793
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:18,275
We've got to go through London
so let's have a darn good dinner

794
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:20,796
a bottle of wine, a musical
with lots of dazzling girls and...

795
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:22,201
and the night train back.

796
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:54,764
Sing, soldier
as you march along

797
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:58,279
Sing, sailor sing a shanty song

798
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:02,002
Let the sound float around
everywhere

799
00:49:02,127 --> 00:49:05,119
Soon the pilots will pick up the air

800
00:49:05,247 --> 00:49:06,236
Zum-tarara!

801
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:10,406
Sing, worker make a cheerful sound...

802
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:13,246
She's nice, isn't she?

803
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,846
Let it ring, have your fling

804
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,923
Life's a bird in the spring

805
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:20,596
And sing, everybody sing

806
00:49:20,727 --> 00:49:24,003
Sing, soldier
as you should march along

807
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,039
Sing, sailor sing a shanty song

808
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:30,762
Let the sound
float around everywhere

809
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,924
Soon the pilots will pick up the air

810
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:35,036
Zum-tarara!

811
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:38,682
Sing, worker
make a cheerful sound

812
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:42,163
Sweet music
makes the wheels go round

813
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:43,766
Let it ring, have your fling...

814
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:47,116
- Don't you think she's nice?
- What?

815
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:50,239
- A nice kid.
- Yes, quite.

816
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,562
Up a bit...
A bit more.

817
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:19,325
Now hold it.
Much too much.

818
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:24,044
Down...down...

819
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:27,284
Hold it now.
Fine.

820
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,485
Sir, have a drink to celebrate.

821
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,040
- We've done the trick.
- What trick?

822
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,159
Flying at 150 feet. No need for altimeters,
no need for anything else.

823
00:50:48,287 --> 00:50:50,243
- How's that?
- It's simple: a couple of spotlamps.

824
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,164
One in the nose,
the other in the belly,

825
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,960
trained to shine down and meet together
at 150 feet below the aircraft.

826
00:50:55,087 --> 00:50:56,679
Watch through the cockpit blister

827
00:50:56,807 --> 00:50:59,196
and keep the two spots plumb together
on the ground or the water

828
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:02,000
and there you are, at 150 feet,
accurate to an inch.

829
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,357
Yeah, but that would mean carrying lights
rights into the attack.

830
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:06,239
That's better than finishing up
on the drink.

831
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,085
That's wonderful!
How did you think of it?

832
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:11,005
Genius, pure genius! We gave the idea
to Farnborough and they did the rest.

833
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,958
We still need a bombsight
that works at low level.

834
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:14,918
When are we getting
some real bombs?

835
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:17,117
It's annoying not knowing
a damn thing about anything.

836
00:51:17,247 --> 00:51:18,863
I know...
But the old boy has got new trials

837
00:51:18,864 --> 00:51:20,478
on Friday, you ought
to go down again.

838
00:51:20,607 --> 00:51:22,120
He's pretty sure it'll work this time.

839
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,356
Oh my God!

840
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:16,043
- It's a bad business, isn't it?
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.

841
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,623
- What are you going to do?

842
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:19,079
- I know the trouble, I
must work in it again.

843
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:21,402
Well, here we are,
the 22nd of April...

844
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:24,325
The deadline for the raid
is the 19th of May.

845
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,325
- That's barely four weeks.
- Give me a few more days. A week, at most.

846
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:30,166
If we're going to change the design
the factories will never do it in time.

847
00:52:30,287 --> 00:52:32,676
I shan't change the design, I must just
strengthen the casing

848
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:34,365
and try a new method of release.

849
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:36,682
Well, a week from today.

850
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:39,241
If it doesn't work then,
we shall have to call it off.

851
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:41,278
There's nothing else we can do.

852
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:46,116
Hello, there.

853
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:49,282
Hello, Gibson.
I was wondering if you were here.

854
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:50,681
I was watching from down there.

855
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:52,684
Why didn't you come
and watch it with me here?

856
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:55,367
I knew how you must be feeling,
I guessed you'd rather be alone.

857
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:01,482
It's a devil, isn't it?

858
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:03,882
Yes, it is rather.

859
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:07,283
It's most disappointing. I shall have to go
all out on some modifications.

860
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,006
- I wonder if I could ask
you to do something.

861
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:10,604
- Of course, anything I can.

862
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:14,638
Well you see, it isn't only the structure
of the bomb that's the trouble,

863
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:18,840
it's in the dropping of it -
we muss lessen the force of the impact.

864
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:24,280
I asked you originally if you could fly in
over water and drop the bomb at 150 feet.

865
00:53:25,047 --> 00:53:27,277
I wonder if you could do it at 60 feet?

866
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:30,080
- That's very low...
- Oh, yes. I do realise that.

867
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,163
You'd only have to hiccup
to finish in the drink.

868
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,836
Yes, I've got no right to ask you
to do a thing like that

869
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:39,164
but I'm afraid it will be our only way.

870
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:40,640
We've had a bit of luck.

871
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:42,883
We've found a way of fixing our height
with spotlamps.

872
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:45,521
I'll have them altered for 60 feet
and have a crack at it tomorrow.

873
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:49,879
You will?
That's...that's splendid.

874
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:52,726
If it's too dangerous,
you mustn't hesitate to let me know.

875
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:54,758
Oh, we'll do it all right.

876
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:09,245
Down...down...

877
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:11,320
Down...

878
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:13,961
Steady...

879
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,839
Up a bit.

880
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:17,685
Up a bit more.

881
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:19,602
Steady.

882
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:23,565
Steady...steady...

883
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:28,446
Hold it now.
Hold it, hold it.

884
00:54:41,807 --> 00:54:44,480
This is bloodily dangerous!

885
00:54:55,847 --> 00:55:00,284
"Sir, as a poultry farmer doing his best
in the food crisis

886
00:55:00,407 --> 00:55:03,126
"l wish to protest
against the stupid young men

887
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:07,877
"who indulge in idiotic joy riding
at all hours of the night.

888
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:09,679
"It may be good fun for them..."

889
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:17,363
"...it may be good fun for them,
but I would point out that

890
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:22,845
"every time they come over our poultry
houses, my hens lay premature eggs

891
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:26,846
"that drop off the perches
and mess up the floor.

892
00:55:26,967 --> 00:55:32,041
"This means a serious loss to both me
and the country."

893
00:55:49,127 --> 00:55:50,480
Sir!

894
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:56,165
You've picked up something here.

895
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:58,357
You were right about that tree,
we did take the top off.

896
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:01,285
I know where it came from.
I suppose we'd better send it back.

897
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:07,504
- Well, it's now or never, Mutt.

898
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:10,081
- Don't you worry, it's
going to be all right.

899
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,403
You'd better get a move on.
It's a good half hour's drive to Reculver.

900
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,556
Take a longer run in
to be certain of that altitude.

901
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,166
I'll watch it.

902
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:27,006
- Well, good luck.
- You pray for me, I'll pray for you.

903
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:32,164
If he doesn't hurry up,
it'll be dark.

904
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:34,357
The poor chap is probably hoping
it will be dark.

905
00:56:34,487 --> 00:56:37,240
The time I wasted on this damn thing
is driving me crazy.

906
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:40,120
It will all be over soon
one way or another.

907
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:45,115
Sorry to keep you all waiting. There are
so many last minute things to attend to.

908
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:51,035
Go ahead.
You'd better get a move on.

909
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:04,836
Hello, Gibson.

910
00:57:05,607 --> 00:57:09,156
We've had an awful day
I never thought we'd do it.

911
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:12,677
These observer fellows... I felt like a man
being driven out for execution.

912
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:15,241
Don't say another word
till you've looked over there and wished.

913
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:16,482
- What?
- New moon.

914
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:17,596
Oh!

915
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:20,525
- Have you wished?
- Oh, yes! And you?

916
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:23,366
Yep. That's our moon.
It's going to be a lucky one.

917
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:27,002
I hope so. Oh, I do hope so.

918
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:29,880
Well, we're all right on altitude
if we can fly at 60 feet in the dark.

919
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:32,840
May dear boy, can you do that?
That's absolutely splendid!

920
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,639
Yes, we've been at it all week.

921
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:38,085
- Here they come.
- Good luck.

922
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:13,806
Oh, my dear God!

923
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:23,323
- Well, I must say, that was wonderful.
- I'm immensely relieved.

924
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:25,199
- Do you smoke, Wallis?
- No, thanks.

925
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:28,125
I'll get through to the factories tonight
and give them the green light.

926
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:29,760
Any final instructions for them?

927
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:33,960
No, they can go ahead on the same
specifications they were given last week.

928
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:37,124
Well, Mr Wallis, it must be a wonderful
feeling to achieve a thing like this...

929
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:41,126
to conceive something absolutely unheard of
and carry it through with flying colours.

930
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:43,842
How on Earth did you ever get the idea?

931
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:49,277
Well... To be quite honest,
it isn't really my idea at all. l...

932
00:58:49,407 --> 00:58:50,726
I got it from Nelson.

933
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:52,280
Nelson, you say?

934
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,398
Yes, he discovered
that under certain conditions

935
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:56,916
he could get more destructive results
from his cannon balls

936
00:58:57,047 --> 00:59:00,437
by making them ricochet off the sea
before hitting the enemy ships.

937
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:04,845
Usually he pitched them about two thirds
of the way between his guns and the target.

938
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:09,085
But there is some evidence to suggest
that during the Battle of the Nile

939
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:12,404
he dismissed the French flagship
with a yorker.

940
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:17,603
Wing Commander Gibson, sir.

941
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,326
- Good evening, Gibson.
- Good evening, sir.

942
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:24,484
I've been looking at the reconnaissance
photographs that came in today.

943
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:27,326
It looks as if the water will be
at the level we need in a week's time.

944
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:30,883
The moon's full next Tuesday,
so we're pretty close to deadline.

945
00:59:31,007 --> 00:59:33,999
We're all right on low flying, but there's
still the matter of the special bombsight.

946
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:36,357
Yes, I've had the backroom boys
busy on that.

947
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:40,275
You're going to laugh when you see this.
It looks like a coat hanger from a bazaar.

948
00:59:40,407 --> 00:59:44,844
Do you see the idea? Your bomb aimer
keeps his eye to this peephole.

949
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:49,119
When these two nails are in
direct alignment with the towers,

950
00:59:49,247 --> 00:59:53,240
then you'll be exactly 600 yards
from the wall...and away goes your bomb.

951
00:59:53,367 --> 00:59:54,880
Do you think it's too simple?

952
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,124
No, sir. I'm all in favour of things
being simple, but, Good Lord...

953
00:59:58,247 --> 01:00:01,796
There it is. Try it out on the towers
at the Derwent Water dam.

954
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:32,082
Bomb gone.

955
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,881
Bomb gone.

956
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:15,316
Bomb gone!

957
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:39,962
Well, the sixpenny bombsight works
and the spotlamps work.

958
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:43,397
We've flown 2,000 hours and dropped more
than 2,000 practice bombs.

959
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,397
The specially converted aircraft
start arriving tomorrow.

960
01:01:46,527 --> 01:01:48,683
So from now until the
word go, practise

961
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:50,839
flying them at you're
proper all-up weights.

962
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:52,286
You can work that out, Dinghy.

963
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,477
Don't forget that
some of the armour's been taken out.

964
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:57,201
And don't exceed 63,000lbs,
otherwise we shan't get off.

965
01:01:58,527 --> 01:02:01,246
- Any problems?
- Does the front gunner stay in his turret?

966
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:02,800
Yes, he'll have to deal with the flak guns.

967
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,806
The trouble is that his feet dangle
in front of the bomb-aimer's face.

968
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:08,526
How about fixing up
stirrups to get his feet

969
01:02:08,527 --> 01:02:10,124
out of the way and make
him more comfortable?

970
01:02:10,247 --> 01:02:12,807
- That's a good plan.
- Have you any idea when we're going, sir?

971
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:18,123
Probably within a week,
but keep it under your hats.

972
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:21,125
You won't have to put up with being called
the armchair squadron much longer.

973
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:23,841
Two months without an operation -
it's getting a stale joke now.

974
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:27,323
There was nearly a riot when a fellow
from 57th Squadron started it again.

975
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:29,438
Our fellows would feel better
if they blew off steam.

976
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:32,843
All right, the next time anyone
start's being funny, have a riot.

977
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:35,406
All right, that's all.

978
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:44,121
- Have you seen the squadron orders?
- Yes. Same old stuff.

979
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:49,647
It's good to have
an evening off for once.

980
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:53,521
Yes, 16 ops last month,
7 in the first two weeks in May.

981
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:57,640
What are you fellows going to do
when you've worn those armchairs out?

982
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:05,277
It's a joke, you know.
Can't you take it?

983
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,240
We're getting a little tired of it.
Come on chaps.

984
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:26,836
Come in.

985
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:31,916
The Group Captain's asking for you, sir.
He's waiting outside.

986
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:45,803
- Steady!
- Let go!

987
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:05,600
- Thank you, sir.
- Saved my life.

988
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:11,204
- Hello, Guy.
- What's going on?

989
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:16,003
One of the boys from 57th Squadron
shot his mouth off once too often.

990
01:04:17,647 --> 01:04:21,117
I've just had word from Group.
Weather reports are good.

991
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,398
If it holds like this,
you'll do the job tomorrow night.

992
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:27,761
Good. What about the bombs?

993
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:29,206
Theyre arriving now.

994
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:33,998
I'm glad we're going.

995
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:38,006
There's no harm telling your flight
commanders, but keep it to yourselves.

996
01:04:38,127 --> 01:04:39,276
Right.

997
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:43,241
I'll break up that show in there
and get the boys to bed.

998
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:44,846
Fine.

999
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:49,806
- I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1000
01:05:55,847 --> 01:05:57,599
- Would you sit there, sir, please?
- Yes.

1001
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:04,845
Be seated gentlemen, please.

1002
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:12,306
For the past six weeks
you've been wondering

1003
01:06:12,307 --> 01:06:14,365
why this squadron
has been formed...

1004
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:21,645
Commander Gibson, carry on.

1005
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,477
Well, the training's over.

1006
01:06:28,287 --> 01:06:30,005
For obvious reasons,

1007
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:33,517
you've had to work without knowing
your target or even your weapon.

1008
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:36,241
You've had to put up with a good deal
from other people

1009
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,881
who think you've been having a soft time.

1010
01:06:39,007 --> 01:06:41,680
But tonight, you're going
to have the chance

1011
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:44,845
to hit the enemy harder
and more destructively

1012
01:06:44,846 --> 01:06:47,882
than any small force
has ever done before.

1013
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,761
You're going to attack
the great dams of Western Germany.

1014
01:06:58,567 --> 01:07:00,046
Here are your targets.

1015
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:04,397
Here's the Möhne dam.

1016
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:06,438
That's the Eder.

1017
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:07,841
And there's the Sorpe.

1018
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:10,003
All just east of the Ruhr.

1019
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:12,917
Now, we shall attack in 3 formations.

1020
01:07:13,047 --> 01:07:17,006
The first will take the Möhne dam as its
first target, then carry on to the Eder.

1021
01:07:17,127 --> 01:07:22,326
That will be nine aircraft in three waves,
taking off ten minutes between each wave.

1022
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:26,076
I'll lead the first with
Hopgood and Martin.

1023
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:27,720
Young leads the second

1024
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:29,997
with Maltby and Shannon.

1025
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:32,400
And Maudslay the third,

1026
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:34,483
with Knight ans Astell.

1027
01:07:34,607 --> 01:07:37,644
The second formation
will consist of five aircraft.

1028
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:43,364
Joe McCarthy, Byers, Barlow,
Rice and Munro.

1029
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,116
They'll go by this northern route
to attack the Sorpe,

1030
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:51,126
and also act as a diversion
to split up enemy fighters.

1031
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:55,445
The third formation will follow
as a mobile reserve to fill in gaps.

1032
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:57,683
That will be five aircraft.

1033
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,959
Townsend, Anderson, Brown,
Ottley and Burpee.

1034
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:11,956
There's a full moon tonight,
so normal ops are out.

1035
01:08:12,087 --> 01:08:14,555
We'll be the only people flying.

1036
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:17,566
And to avoid the fighters,
we'll have to keep

1037
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:20,444
at zero feet all the
way there and back.

1038
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:53,117
Any questions?

1039
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:56,125
- Can I say something about the route, sir?
- Yes, go ahead.

1040
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:59,398
I see you've taken it very near
a synthetic rubber factory at Hüls.

1041
01:08:59,527 --> 01:09:01,165
There's a great deal of flak around there.

1042
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,881
It's a hot spot. We nearly got the
chop there about three months ago.

1043
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:06,680
Can I suggest we go a little further north?

1044
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:09,037
Yes, we knew about that
when we planned the route.

1045
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:12,182
The trouble is, if we
go much further north,

1046
01:09:12,183 --> 01:09:15,197
we run into another
hot spot round here.

1047
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:18,246
Anyway, we can take it up a little.

1048
01:09:19,207 --> 01:09:23,803
Now, the gap isn't too wide,
so watch it, you navigators.

1049
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:25,645
What about the defences on the dam, sir?

1050
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:31,080
Reconnaissance show's them as being fairly
light, you'll see the photos in a minute.

1051
01:09:31,207 --> 01:09:32,925
Any balloons, sir?

1052
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:37,522
Up till yesterday, the nearest ones were
around a small factory 1 2 miles away.

1053
01:09:37,647 --> 01:09:39,080
We don't expect any.

1054
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:42,804
Sorry old boy.
It's secret, you can't go in.

1055
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:44,760
Come on, hop it.

1056
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:50,442
Hello, Nigger, old boy.
What are you doing?

1057
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:54,276
Who are you looking for, eh?
He's not in his office.

1058
01:09:54,407 --> 01:09:57,160
You'd better try somewhere else.
Go on, away you go. Go on!

1059
01:10:03,527 --> 01:10:07,281
Hello, Nigger.
No, not in here, old boy. Go on.

1060
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:16,119
Hello, Nigger, old boy.
What are you doing around here?

1061
01:10:17,567 --> 01:10:18,841
Nigger!

1062
01:10:23,247 --> 01:10:28,367
Well, there it is. That's what the
bomb does, the rest is for you.

1063
01:10:29,687 --> 01:10:33,236
And may I say...
good luck to you all.

1064
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:42,325
The Möhne lake looks rather like
a big double tooth.

1065
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:46,918
These strips of water are the roots
with the dam here in the crown.

1066
01:10:47,047 --> 01:10:49,322
Here's the Körbecke bridge
where we assemble.

1067
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:53,156
And here's the spit of land which gives us
a head on approach for the attack.

1068
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:54,720
Study these models.

1069
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:58,044
Get every detail into your heads
until you know them with your eyes shut.

1070
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:00,283
Get these code words off by heart.

1071
01:11:00,407 --> 01:11:04,116
"Goner" is the word for the explosion
of a bomb in the right place.

1072
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:07,398
"Nigger" is the code word
for a breach in the Möhne dam

1073
01:11:07,527 --> 01:11:09,757
and "Dinghy" for a breach in the Eder.

1074
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:26,836
Do you want me, Crosby?

1075
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:30,403
Er, I'm sorry, sir, it's Nigger...
he's been run over. He's dead.

1076
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:32,677
The car didn't even stop.

1077
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:34,763
- Where did it happen?
- Outside the main gate.

1078
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:37,401
He run across the road
and the car hit him.

1079
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:40,166
- Where is he?
- Ln the guard room, sir.

1080
01:11:41,127 --> 01:11:42,606
I see.

1081
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:01,196
- Bacon and eggs for me, please.
- Are you flying tonight, sir?

1082
01:12:01,327 --> 01:12:04,876
Am I flying?! You know perfectly well I'm
the person who pays you every fortnight.

1083
01:12:05,007 --> 01:12:08,477
Your bread and jam is on
the centre table, sir.

1084
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:10,518
No harm in trying.

1085
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,956
- We've got the wrong oil.
- It was checked this morning.

1086
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,396
No, I don't mean that oil.
It's the bomb release gear.

1087
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:20,483
Wallis is chasing around
for the right kind.

1088
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:22,359
- Can he get it?
- I hope so.

1089
01:12:22,487 --> 01:12:26,321
- Are you flying tonight, sir?
- That's the general idea.

1090
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:30,844
Can I have you next egg
if you don't come back?

1091
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:32,446
OK, I'll have yours if you don't.

1092
01:12:52,087 --> 01:12:53,981
We've still got an hour.

1093
01:12:53,982 --> 01:12:55,875
Let's put our feet up for
a bit before we change.

1094
01:12:56,007 --> 01:12:57,918
Not a bad idea. Come on.

1095
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:03,637
- Got anything for me?
- Just one, sir.

1096
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:11,480
- It's only a missed bill!
- I think I'll pay that tomorrow.

1097
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:14,286
Thank you.

1098
01:13:16,207 --> 01:13:18,402
It's all right,
they had some of the lighter oil in store.

1099
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,358
- Oh, good.
- They're changing it now.

1100
01:13:20,487 --> 01:13:23,957
- Bit of luck you noticed it.
- It was my fault it wasn't made clear.

1101
01:13:24,087 --> 01:13:28,239
- What about some supper?
- Well... I think I'll have some later.

1102
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:33,317
- Does it worry you, having me about?
- No, I'm jolly glad you came!

1103
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:34,926
Was my talk at the briefing all right?

1104
01:13:35,047 --> 01:13:36,958
Oh, fine.
You sold them that bomb hands down.

1105
01:13:37,087 --> 01:13:39,157
Coffee, sir?

1106
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:41,243
Er, no, thank you.

1107
01:13:43,087 --> 01:13:46,204
Go on, have some.
There's plenty of time.

1108
01:13:46,327 --> 01:13:47,760
Oh, thank you.

1109
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,245
Evening, sir.

1110
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:12,119
- Flight...
- Sir?

1111
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,078
Just a minute.

1112
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,158
You know that Nigger was killed
this afternoon?

1113
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:19,278
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

1114
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:24,356
Would you bury him at midnight
on the grass verge outside my office?

1115
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:26,284
Very good, sir.

1116
01:14:26,407 --> 01:14:30,320
I'd like you to do it at about the time
we're going into the job over there.

1117
01:14:30,447 --> 01:14:32,244
I'll see it's done, sir.

1118
01:14:35,127 --> 01:14:38,756
Hello, Hoppy. Tonight's the night,
tomorrow we'll have a party.

1119
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:57,397
Come in.

1120
01:14:57,527 --> 01:15:00,325
- Laundry just in, sir.
- Oh, great.

1121
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,844
Well...

1122
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:18,198
I think I'll have a clean shirt
and a nice clean shave.

1123
01:15:18,327 --> 01:15:19,646
What do you want to shave for now?

1124
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:23,043
If we have to bail out,
you never know who we might meet.

1125
01:15:25,407 --> 01:15:27,318
There's no point in me bothering.

1126
01:15:27,447 --> 01:15:32,237
If we come down together and there happens
to be two about, I'll get the ugly one!

1127
01:15:54,447 --> 01:15:56,324
- All right, sir?
- Yes.

1128
01:18:09,207 --> 01:18:11,960
Well, chaps, my watch says time to go.

1129
01:19:36,487 --> 01:19:38,876
- How is she, Sergeant?
- Bang on, sir.

1130
01:20:32,607 --> 01:20:34,165
- All set?
- Yes, sir.

1131
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:36,437
You've done a fine job with this team.

1132
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:39,445
- I couldn't have asked for a better one.
- Good luck.

1133
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:40,920
Thank you, sir.

1134
01:20:41,047 --> 01:20:42,605
Good luck.

1135
01:20:44,967 --> 01:20:46,366
Come on, then.

1136
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:01,717
OK, Hutch.

1137
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:12,925
Pitch fully fine.

1138
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:15,845
- Pitch fully fine.
- Check fuel.

1139
01:23:16,887 --> 01:23:20,357
- Fuel OK.
- Lamps 25 degrees.

1140
01:23:20,487 --> 01:23:23,206
- Lamps 25 degrees.
- Radiator shutters automatic.

1141
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,078
Radiator shutters automatic.

1142
01:25:16,567 --> 01:25:20,526
Well, I suppose
there's nothing much we can do.

1143
01:25:20,647 --> 01:25:23,161
Except wait.

1144
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:26,199
The A.O.C. is waiting
to take us back to Grantham.

1145
01:25:43,327 --> 01:25:46,399
Send a message to Hopgood.

1146
01:25:53,247 --> 01:25:55,477
Heay, Sparks?
P-Popsy signalling.

1147
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:12,526
Martin is having a chat with Hopgood.

1148
01:26:21,847 --> 01:26:23,246
What's he saying, Hutch?

1149
01:26:26,087 --> 01:26:28,203
He says we're going to get
speeches tomorrow night.

1150
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:32,397
Sure we are!
Biggest binge of all time.

1151
01:26:54,367 --> 01:26:55,925
Carry on.

1152
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:59,119
- Well, Coggie, how is it going?
- All right so far, sir.

1153
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:01,522
The first wave is about 20 miles
from the Dutch coast.

1154
01:27:01,647 --> 01:27:04,639
Enemy radar has probably
picked them up by now.

1155
01:27:04,767 --> 01:27:08,316
Cheer up, Wallis. This is your night
as well as theirs.

1156
01:27:30,527 --> 01:27:34,839
Skipper, ground speed: 203.
We'll be there in one hour and ten minutes.

1157
01:27:34,967 --> 01:27:37,640
Will be over the Dutch coast
in two minutes.

1158
01:27:42,207 --> 01:27:45,358
There it is now.
Stand by, front gunner, we're going over.

1159
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,920
The second wave should be coming up
to the Dutch coast now.

1160
01:28:40,287 --> 01:28:42,642
Enemy coast ahead.

1161
01:29:34,047 --> 01:29:35,958
Enemy coast ahead.

1162
01:31:00,927 --> 01:31:03,202
We should be on the line of the canal.

1163
01:31:07,927 --> 01:31:09,246
OK, I've got it.

1164
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:27,243
Watch out for pylons.

1165
01:31:31,567 --> 01:31:34,035
- There they are.
- Pylons.

1166
01:31:46,487 --> 01:31:50,321
At the junction, we alter course.
The next thing we see in the Rhein.

1167
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:08,236
This is new.
Hutch, warn the others.

1168
01:33:48,007 --> 01:33:51,363
New course, skipper:
165, magnetic.

1169
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:16,045
The northern wave
have run into trouble on the coast.

1170
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,761
McCarthy is going on the
Sorpe dam by himself.

1171
01:34:20,327 --> 01:34:23,239
Gibson's formation should be nearly
at the Möhne by now.

1172
01:34:33,287 --> 01:34:35,005
There's the lake now.

1173
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:37,641
The main lake and the dam
are off to the right.

1174
01:35:05,807 --> 01:35:07,320
There it is, boys.

1175
01:35:07,447 --> 01:35:09,165
Pretty impressive, aren't they?

1176
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,926
Someone's woken them up.
What do you think about it, Bob?

1177
01:35:12,047 --> 01:35:15,562
My goodness! It's big, isn't it?
Can we really break that?

1178
01:35:15,687 --> 01:35:17,279
How many guns do you think there are,
Trevor?

1179
01:35:17,407 --> 01:35:19,238
I say there's about ten guns.

1180
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:23,125
Some in the field
and some in the towers.

1181
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:25,886
We've seem to upset them a bit.

1182
01:35:38,887 --> 01:35:40,161
P for Popsy, are you there?

1183
01:35:40,287 --> 01:35:42,005
OK, leader.

1184
01:35:42,127 --> 01:35:44,402
Hello, M-Mother. Are you there?

1185
01:35:44,527 --> 01:35:45,562
I'm here, leader.

1186
01:35:45,687 --> 01:35:47,837
- Here, leader.
- Here, leader.

1187
01:35:47,967 --> 01:35:50,083
- Here, leader.
- Here, leader.

1188
01:35:50,207 --> 01:35:51,401
Here, leader.

1189
01:35:54,407 --> 01:35:59,083
Hello, all cooler aircraft.
I'm going into attack.

1190
01:35:59,207 --> 01:36:01,641
Stand by to come in to your order
when I tell.

1191
01:36:11,527 --> 01:36:15,281
Hello, M for Mother.
Stand by to take over if anything happens.

1192
01:36:15,407 --> 01:36:17,477
OK, leader.
Good luck.

1193
01:36:34,887 --> 01:36:37,526
Check height.
Speed control, Pulford.

1194
01:36:37,647 --> 01:36:38,762
Gunners ready.

1195
01:36:38,887 --> 01:36:40,718
Coming up, Spam.

1196
01:36:40,847 --> 01:36:44,999
- 220.
- This is fine, I can see everything.

1197
01:36:47,967 --> 01:36:49,685
- Down a little.
- 230.

1198
01:36:49,807 --> 01:36:52,560
- 230.
- Steady.

1199
01:36:52,687 --> 01:36:54,006
Down a little.
- 235.

1200
01:36:54,127 --> 01:36:56,163
Stand by to pull me under the seat
if I get hit.

1201
01:37:00,207 --> 01:37:01,765
- Steady...
- 240.

1202
01:37:01,887 --> 01:37:02,956
Steady...

1203
01:37:03,087 --> 01:37:05,647
- Hold her steady.
- 235.

1204
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:10,037
- Hold that.
- 240.

1205
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:11,885
- 235.
- That's fine.

1206
01:37:12,007 --> 01:37:14,123
- 235.
- Bomb, gone!

1207
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:37,246
Good shot! Nice work!

1208
01:37:37,367 --> 01:37:39,642
- Nice work, Skipper.
- Bang on, Skipper.

1209
01:37:46,007 --> 01:37:48,840
It's gone, we've done it.

1210
01:37:48,967 --> 01:37:52,357
We haven't. It's still there.

1211
01:37:56,127 --> 01:37:58,083
Hello, M for Mother.
Are you there?

1212
01:37:58,207 --> 01:38:00,084
Standing by, leader.

1213
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:02,323
Hang on a minute,
until the water comes down.

1214
01:38:02,447 --> 01:38:06,235
Hutch, send back codeword "Goner".

1215
01:38:13,127 --> 01:38:15,004
Goner...

1216
01:38:15,127 --> 01:38:17,083
from G-George.

1217
01:38:20,967 --> 01:38:22,764
That's all.

1218
01:38:23,607 --> 01:38:26,121
I'd hoped one bomb might do it.

1219
01:38:36,127 --> 01:38:39,563
Hello, M-Mother.
It's your turn, you can go in now.

1220
01:38:39,687 --> 01:38:44,636
- Good luck.
- OK, leader. Attacking!

1221
01:38:44,767 --> 01:38:46,246
Stand by to go in.

1222
01:38:57,007 --> 01:38:59,475
If he doesn't drop his bomb now
it'll be too late.

1223
01:38:59,607 --> 01:39:02,519
He's dropped it. There it goes.
Oh, they've got him!

1224
01:39:03,407 --> 01:39:04,920
It's from right over the top.

1225
01:39:27,247 --> 01:39:28,726
Hello, P for Popsy.

1226
01:39:28,847 --> 01:39:30,917
- Are you there?
- OK, leader.

1227
01:39:31,047 --> 01:39:32,844
You can go right in.

1228
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,765
I'll fly across the dam
to draw the flak off you.

1229
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,559
OK, thanks, leader.

1230
01:39:37,687 --> 01:39:39,598
Stand by, everyone.
We're going in.

1231
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:54,445
230.

1232
01:39:55,207 --> 01:39:56,925
230.

1233
01:39:57,687 --> 01:39:59,564
- 230.
- Down a bit.

1234
01:39:59,687 --> 01:40:00,836
- 235.
- Down a bit.

1235
01:40:00,967 --> 01:40:04,198
- Steady... Up a bit.
- 230.

1236
01:40:04,327 --> 01:40:05,282
It's all yours, Bob.

1237
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:07,280
- 235.
- Steady.

1238
01:40:11,087 --> 01:40:13,123
- Hold her...
- 230.

1239
01:40:13,247 --> 01:40:15,203
- Hold her, steady.
- 235.

1240
01:40:15,327 --> 01:40:16,919
- Hold her.
- 235.

1241
01:40:17,047 --> 01:40:18,036
- That's fine.
- 235.

1242
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:19,156
Bomb gone!

1243
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:30,677
The wing is hit!

1244
01:40:30,807 --> 01:40:33,799
Starboard out was empty, thank God.

1245
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:36,680
- Bomb's gone, leader.
- OK, Popsy.

1246
01:40:36,807 --> 01:40:38,320
Let me know
when you're out of the flak.

1247
01:40:38,447 --> 01:40:40,358
All OK Behind.

1248
01:40:52,847 --> 01:40:55,042
Goner from P-Popsy.

1249
01:41:07,367 --> 01:41:08,880
That's all.

1250
01:41:25,807 --> 01:41:27,399
Hello, A-Apple. Are you ready?

1251
01:41:27,527 --> 01:41:29,438
OK, leader.

1252
01:41:29,567 --> 01:41:32,957
Let me know when you're in position
and I'll draw the flak for you.

1253
01:41:34,247 --> 01:41:35,566
P-Popsy, are you hit?

1254
01:41:35,687 --> 01:41:39,282
Starboard wing, but we're all right,
we can make it.

1255
01:41:39,407 --> 01:41:40,840
A-Apple is going to attack.

1256
01:41:40,967 --> 01:41:43,527
Come in on his starboard side
and help me draw the flak.

1257
01:41:43,647 --> 01:41:44,762
OK, leader.

1258
01:41:45,407 --> 01:41:48,080
A-Apple making bombing run.

1259
01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:00,277
Goner...

1260
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:02,318
from A-Apple.

1261
01:43:06,407 --> 01:43:08,318
That's all.

1262
01:43:19,407 --> 01:43:21,045
Hello, J-Johnny.
Are you ready?

1263
01:43:21,167 --> 01:43:23,203
OK, leader.

1264
01:43:23,327 --> 01:43:26,524
All right, go ahead.
We'll come in with you.

1265
01:44:14,287 --> 01:44:17,916
- Are you there, Dave?
- Ready, leader.

1266
01:44:18,047 --> 01:44:20,925
OK. Stand by to attack.

1267
01:44:28,327 --> 01:44:30,283
It's gone! Look!

1268
01:44:30,407 --> 01:44:32,637
My God;

1269
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:43,323
- Are you there, Dave?
- Ready, leader.

1270
01:44:44,207 --> 01:44:47,483
It's all right. Skip it!

1271
01:44:59,527 --> 01:45:02,758
All right, boys.
Nice work! You've had your look.

1272
01:45:02,887 --> 01:45:05,526
P-Popsy and J-Johnny,
set course for home.

1273
01:45:05,647 --> 01:45:07,478
The rest of you come along with me.

1274
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:28,558
It's Nigger! It's gone!

1275
01:45:31,847 --> 01:45:33,758
- You've done it, Wallis.
- Well done, well done!

1276
01:45:33,887 --> 01:45:35,764
Congratulations!

1277
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:48,601
I reckon you should be able
to see it by now.

1278
01:45:55,127 --> 01:45:57,038
No sign of it.

1279
01:45:59,327 --> 01:46:00,840
Do you recognise anything, Spam?

1280
01:46:02,167 --> 01:46:05,557
Plenty of water...
No dam yet.

1281
01:46:06,567 --> 01:46:09,445
Wait...there it is!

1282
01:46:17,207 --> 01:46:19,004
All right, Dave.
You go in first.

1283
01:46:19,127 --> 01:46:20,743
There doesn't seem to
be any flaks, but it's

1284
01:46:20,744 --> 01:46:22,358
not going to be easy
with all these hills.

1285
01:46:22,487 --> 01:46:26,116
- Can you see the castle?
- I've got it, leader.

1286
01:46:27,567 --> 01:46:31,765
That's your way in.
Take your time. We've only got three bombs.

1287
01:46:31,887 --> 01:46:34,276
OK, leader. Going in now.

1288
01:46:54,967 --> 01:46:57,003
Down...down...

1289
01:46:57,127 --> 01:47:01,200
Down...down...down...

1290
01:47:01,327 --> 01:47:03,363
- We're too high.
- Down...

1291
01:47:03,487 --> 01:47:05,478
We're too high, Skipper.
We won't make it.

1292
01:47:05,607 --> 01:47:07,677
Steady...hold it there.

1293
01:47:07,807 --> 01:47:10,367
It's too late, Skipper.
It's too late.

1294
01:47:32,967 --> 01:47:35,003
Sorry, leader.
Made a mess of that.

1295
01:47:35,127 --> 01:47:36,942
- I'll try again.

1296
01:47:36,943 --> 01:47:38,756
- All right, Dave.
You hang around for a bit.

1297
01:47:40,247 --> 01:47:44,320
- Hello, Z-Zebra. Are you there?
- Here, leader. I've got the target.

1298
01:47:44,447 --> 01:47:49,237
All right, you can go in now.
There's no flak, but watch those hills.

1299
01:47:49,367 --> 01:47:52,040
Take your time
and mind the mountain on the other side.

1300
01:47:52,167 --> 01:47:56,160
- OK, leader. I'm going in.
- Good luck.

1301
01:48:27,247 --> 01:48:28,919
He's left it too late.

1302
01:48:35,647 --> 01:48:38,081
Hello, Z-Zebra.
Are you all right?

1303
01:48:39,007 --> 01:48:41,760
I think so, leader.
Stand by.

1304
01:49:07,367 --> 01:49:09,323
Goner Z-Zebra.

1305
01:49:12,607 --> 01:49:15,121
That leaves two more.

1306
01:49:15,247 --> 01:49:16,919
Cocoa, sir?

1307
01:49:18,247 --> 01:49:20,966
- Sir?
- No.

1308
01:49:33,327 --> 01:49:35,124
Are you in touch
with the reserve formation?

1309
01:49:35,247 --> 01:49:39,479
All except Burpee, sir.
He hasn't answered for some time.

1310
01:49:43,127 --> 01:49:45,197
Goner, L-Leather.

1311
01:49:52,527 --> 01:49:55,963
OK, Dave.
Bang on but you didn't break it.

1312
01:49:56,087 --> 01:49:58,760
Hello, N for Nuts.
Are you ready to make your attack?

1313
01:49:58,887 --> 01:50:00,639
- Ready, leader.

1314
01:50:06,527 --> 01:50:09,724
Come in down
and dive for the point, Les.

1315
01:50:09,847 --> 01:50:14,637
Get off the air, Dave. You've got
the last bomb, Les, so take your time.

1316
01:50:15,487 --> 01:50:16,681
Good luck.

1317
01:50:23,687 --> 01:50:28,442
Down...down...
Steady...hold it...

1318
01:50:29,287 --> 01:50:30,766
A little bit more...

1319
01:50:31,807 --> 01:50:34,321
That's fine, steady...

1320
01:50:34,447 --> 01:50:37,041
Steady...bomb gone!

1321
01:51:07,527 --> 01:51:10,883
It's Dinghy! They've done it!
They've got the Eder dam as well!

1322
01:51:15,847 --> 01:51:19,965
Wallis, when you first came to me with this
I didn't believe a word you said.

1323
01:51:20,087 --> 01:51:23,124
Now, you can sell me a pink elephant!

1324
01:51:33,247 --> 01:51:35,124
All right boys, home.

1325
01:51:36,127 --> 01:51:39,244
They know we're here now
so keep your eyes open.

1326
01:55:09,647 --> 01:55:11,797
'This is London.

1327
01:55:11,927 --> 01:55:14,600
'The Air Ministry have just
issued the following communiqué.

1328
01:55:14,727 --> 01:55:19,039
'ln early hours of this morning,
a force of Lancasters of Bomber Command

1329
01:55:19,167 --> 01:55:23,046
'led by Wing Commander G. P. Gibson,
D.S.O., D.F.C.

1330
01:55:23,167 --> 01:55:27,877
'attacked with mines the dams
of the Möhne and Sorpe reservoirs.

1331
01:55:28,007 --> 01:55:33,479
'These controlled two-thirds of the water
storage capacity of the Ruhr basin.

1332
01:55:33,607 --> 01:55:36,360
'Reconnaissance later established
that the Möhne dam

1333
01:55:36,487 --> 01:55:39,240
'had been breached over a length
of 100 yards

1334
01:55:39,367 --> 01:55:43,883
'and that the power station below had
been swept away by the resulting floods.

1335
01:55:44,007 --> 01:55:48,398
'The Eder dam, which controls the
head-waters of the Weser and Fulda valleys

1336
01:55:48,527 --> 01:55:54,079
'and operates several power stations,
was also attacked and reported as breached.

1337
01:55:54,207 --> 01:55:58,120
'Photographs show the river below the dam
in full flood.

1338
01:55:58,247 --> 01:56:01,284
'The attacks were pressed home
from a very low level

1339
01:56:01,407 --> 01:56:06,162
'with great determination and coolness
in the face of fierce resistance.

1340
01:56:06,287 --> 01:56:09,359
'Eight of the Lancasters are missing.'

1341
01:57:21,927 --> 01:57:23,838
Is it true?
All those fellows lost?

1342
01:57:23,967 --> 01:57:26,037
Only two aircrafts went down
in the attacks.

1343
01:57:26,167 --> 01:57:28,635
That was Hopgood's over the Möhne
and Maudslay's over the Eder.

1344
01:57:28,767 --> 01:57:31,486
Astell got it soon after crossing the coast

1345
01:57:31,607 --> 01:57:35,282
and Dinghy Young was shot down
over the sea on his way home.

1346
01:57:35,407 --> 01:57:36,965
The rest we don't know about.

1347
01:57:37,087 --> 01:57:39,760
They've been calling them since midnight
but they haven't answered.

1348
01:57:39,887 --> 01:57:42,959
The flak was bad,
worse than I expected.

1349
01:57:44,167 --> 01:57:51,118
56 men... If I'd known it was going
to be like this, I'd never have started it.

1350
01:57:51,247 --> 01:57:52,726
You mustn't think that way.

1351
01:57:52,847 --> 01:57:55,919
If these fellows had known they wouldn't be
coming back they'd have gone just the same.

1352
01:57:56,047 --> 01:57:58,277
There isn't a single one of them
that would have dropped out.

1353
01:57:58,407 --> 01:58:00,637
I knew them all,
I know that's true.

1354
01:58:02,447 --> 01:58:04,836
Look, you've had a worse night
than any of us

1355
01:58:04,967 --> 01:58:08,084
Why don't you go and find a doctor
and ask for one of his sleeping pills?

1356
01:58:09,407 --> 01:58:12,047
Aren't you going
to turn in, Gibby?

1357
01:58:12,048 --> 01:58:14,686
No, I... I have to write 
some letters first.
