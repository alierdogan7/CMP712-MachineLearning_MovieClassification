1
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,760
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

2
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

3
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,081
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

4
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,480
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,528
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

6
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,681
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

7
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,058
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

8
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,119
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.

9
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,618
To an American reporter...

10
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,623
there is something very special
about the people of this city...

11
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,122
this island, this nation.

12
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,125
Never in the long and stormy
history of Great Britain...

13
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,628
have her fortunes been
as low as they are...

14
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,094
in this spring of 1941.

15
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:25,689
Britain is fighting alone
for her very existence...

16
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,199
fighting desperately.

17
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,705
Yet her people remain
steadfast and unflinching.

18
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,705
Britain's allies have been
defeated one by one...

19
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:36,207
as the dark stain of Nazi conquest...

20
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,208
spreads across the map of Europe.

21
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:42,737
In Africa, Rommel is giving
the Eighth Army a very bad time.

22
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,212
Greece has fallen.

23
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,182
And the <i>Luftwaffe</i> continues
to smash English cities.

24
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:51,084
The worst news of all
comes from the North Atlantic...

25
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:54,588
where last month, German U-boats
and surface raiders...

26
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,682
sank 600,000 tons of shipping.

27
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,554
In this battle,
Britain's lifeblood is at stake.

28
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:02,255
This is the battle on which depends...

29
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,298
the future course of the war...

30
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:06,126
the future course of British history.

31
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:13,694
The battle of the North Atlantic
is fought at sea...

32
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:17,434
but it is directed from
the admiralty, here in London.

33
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:25,716
Very deep in the ancient
Admiralty Building...

34
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,216
200 feet underground, is the war room.

35
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,708
Here is the guiding brain
and central nervous system...

36
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,186
of the British navy...

37
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:34,687
The Operations Division.

38
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:37,850
Robert.

39
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,015
Sir?

40
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,525
Take Captain Shepard's things...

41
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,356
and put them in the office.

42
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,361
Aye, sir.

43
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,692
Thank you.

44
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,732
This, of course, is the message center...

45
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,200
for incoming and outgoing signals.

46
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:53,238
These tubes lead to
the wireless room down the hall.

47
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:59,242
Oh, Shepard...
Anything wrong?

48
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:00,707
That man's uniform.

49
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:03,143
Oh. We're quite informal here
about some things.

50
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,679
You'll find it's much different...

51
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,181
from the bridge of a ship at sea.

52
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,680
It has to be that way.

53
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,185
Shepard, this is Commander Richards...

54
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,686
the duty plot officer.

55
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:16,187
Captain Shepard is
the new director of operations.

56
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,689
[Mouth Full Of Food] How do you do?

57
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,692
Don't let me interrupt your meal.

58
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,693
Captain Shepard,
Second Officer Anne Davis.

59
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,695
Captain Shepard's taking over for me.

60
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,196
How do you do, sir?

61
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,697
How do you do?

62
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:29,197
Be nice to her, Shepard.

63
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,699
If she got angry and walked out,
we'd lose the war.

64
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,861
Really?

65
00:05:32,937 --> 00:05:35,405
Seriously, you can depend on
this young lady.

66
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,405
I've done it many times.

67
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,202
Anne, be a darling, will you...

68
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:41,276
and get your plot report in
as soon as possible.

69
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,775
We mustn't be late...

70
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,277
forJimmy's party tonight.

71
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,710
Right-oh.

72
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,214
I suppose I should shed a few tears...

73
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,713
at leaving this place...

74
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,216
but quite honestly, I've hated the job.

75
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,946
Too much responsibility,
strain.

76
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,716
I'm getting a command at sea.

77
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,220
That's what I've always wanted.

78
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,220
Congratulations.

79
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,223
I hope you find one...

80
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,657
that doesn't involve too much strain.

81
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:04,660
It's a different kind of strain.

82
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:07,663
If a man's going to serve in the navy...

83
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,665
he ought to serve at sea...

84
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,631
unless, of course,
it's a man like yourself...

85
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,292
who's already seen action.

86
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,337
He should still serve at sea.

87
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,838
Yes. Well, I better get along.

88
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,338
I'll say good-bye now...

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,668
unless you have any questions.

90
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,675
I don't think so. Good luck.

91
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:23,733
Thank you.

92
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,229
We thought we might be of some
assistance, sir...

93
00:06:55,303 --> 00:06:57,237
not knowing your way around yet.

94
00:06:57,305 --> 00:07:00,741
Is there anything I can do for you?

95
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:02,832
Yes, there is something.

96
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,174
I saw a rating enter the war room...

97
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,679
without his jumper.

98
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:10,704
From now on, everyone
will be properly dressed at all times.

99
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,718
I cannot have officers
eating sandwiches on duty...

100
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:15,217
Commander, under any circumstances.

101
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,219
I'm sorry, sir. Won't happen again.

102
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,688
Excuse me, sir.

103
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,020
I think you should know
that Commander Richards...

104
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:22,556
stood two watches without relief...

105
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,058
I'm sure Commander Richards...

106
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:27,153
doesn't need an interpreter,
Miss Davis.

107
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,220
I was also surprised
to hear a Wren officer...

108
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,630
addressed by her Christian name.

109
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,395
To me, this kind of informality...

110
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,993
is both irregular and inexcusable.

111
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,195
Come in!

112
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,241
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

113
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,706
Priority signal.

114
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,242
Thank you.

115
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,247
Huh. Excuse me.

116
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:04,281
Come in.

117
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,450
Oh, Shepard.

118
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,960
You know the assistant chief
of naval staff.

119
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,429
Yes, indeed, sir. Very well.

120
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,954
How are you,Jonathan?
I'm glad to see you again.

121
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,432
I have a signal here...

122
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,469
from our naval attache in Stockholm.

123
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:18,470
He reports two large German warships...

124
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:19,937
steaming through the Kattegat.

125
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,438
What ships are they?

126
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,940
He doesn't say.

127
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:24,975
Think it might be the <i>Bismarck?</i>

128
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,441
It's possible, sir.

129
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,502
She's just completed
three months' training...

130
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,945
in the Baltic.

131
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,515
Couldn't pick a better time
to break out...

132
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,516
with this Crete business
going on...

133
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,983
and our convoys scattered.

134
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:38,521
I have a nasty hunch
that's the idea, sir.

135
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:39,986
I hope you're wrong.

136
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,523
Can't afford to have that monster loose.

137
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:44,422
Look what <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and <i>Gneisenau</i> did to us.

138
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,992
22 ships sunk... 115,000 tons.

139
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,029
All in two months.

140
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:51,531
They don't have anything like
<i>Bismarck's</i> fire power.

141
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:55,021
She could stand off and sink
every ship in a convoy...

142
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,535
without ever coming under fire.

143
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,901
Shepard, get on to
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

144
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,438
Tell him we're not sure...

145
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,938
but we're very much concerned.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,439
We'll let him have...

147
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,804
every scrap of information.

148
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,068
Aye aye, sir.

149
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,337
Oh, and, Shepard.

150
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,436
I wish you'd prepare
your recommendations...

151
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:11,809
in case it is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

152
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,439
Very good, sir.

153
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,382
Pretty rough assignment...

154
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,214
for a new man on the job.

155
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,948
I'm not worried about Shepard.

156
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,954
He's one of the ablest men
in the service.

157
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:25,957
I'm told he's as cold
as a witch's heart.

158
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,959
That's a slight exaggeration, sir.

159
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,960
I want a man who's cold.

160
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,963
I'd like a man with no heart at all...

161
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:34,123
no soul...

162
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,631
just an enormous brain.

163
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,667
The battle of the North Atlantic...

164
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,135
is a grim business.

165
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,468
It won't be won
by charm and personality.

166
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,471
We've had too much of that.

167
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:44,972
I've known Shepard for years.

168
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,065
We've served together before.
He was different then.

169
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,972
Any particular reason for the change?

170
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,978
I suspect there are many reasons, sir...

171
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,980
reasons of a personal nature.

172
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:55,481
Oh. I see.

173
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:58,483
Well, how are we going to
get the information...

174
00:09:58,586 --> 00:09:59,985
on those two ships?

175
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,487
We have an agent in southern Norway...

176
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,987
Get in touch with him.

177
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,525
It's too dangerous to get in touch
with him directly.

178
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:10,527
There isn't time to go
through Zurich or Stockholm.

179
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,361
In this case,
you'll have to make direct contact.

180
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,128
Sir, this man is
in Nazi-occupied territory.

181
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,032
I realize that.

182
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:24,403
All the same, we must get
in touch with him immediately.

183
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,838
Aye aye, sir.

184
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,081
[Automatic Weapon Fire]

185
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:09,047
The enemy ships
were sighted coming out of the Baltic...

186
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,058
obviously heading out to sea...

187
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:13,560
obviously not in the service
of the king.

188
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:17,054
Now, what have we got over here
at Scapa Flow?

189
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,565
Battleships <i>King George V,
Prince of Wales...</i>

190
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,033
battle cruiser <i>Hood...</i>

191
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,534
a few cruisers and destroyers.

192
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,231
The rest of the fleet's
out on convoy escort.

193
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,272
It's from Admiral Cunningham, sir.

194
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,274
"Situation in Crete is deteriorating.

195
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:33,368
German airborne troops
have captured Maleme Airfield."

196
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:39,072
Why is it we never get
our bad medicine in small doses?

197
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,548
Perfect timing for an enemy breakout...

198
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,016
in the North Atlantic.

199
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:45,077
Cunningham and his fleet
busy down here in Crete.

200
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,553
Sommerville's got his hands full...

201
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,090
trying to reinforce Malta
with Force H.

202
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,592
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>
are up here at Brest.

203
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,593
We must keep them covered.

204
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:56,094
And 16 convoys to guard...

205
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,098
scattered all over the Atlantic.

206
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:01,497
If we had a hundred more ships...

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,999
we still wouldn't have enough.

208
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,162
Sir, we've just had a signal...

209
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,999
from our agent in Norway.

210
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:08,538
The message is incomplete.

211
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:12,508
"Sighted two enemy ships
of Kristiansand at 033 5
sailing due west...

212
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,508
Cruiser <i>Prinz Eugen</i> and..."

213
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,011
The transmission stopped
abruptly at that point, sir.

214
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,514
Did you try to get him back?

215
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:23,015
Yes, sir. No further contact.

216
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,019
Where is Kristiansand?

217
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,519
Off here, sir.

218
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,020
Southern tip of Norway.

219
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,091
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?

220
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:32,557
I don't think this man...

221
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,559
would have transmitted
in the circumstances...

222
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,562
if it hadn't been something
really important.

223
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,065
Then we'll proceed on the assumption...

224
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:42,598
that it's <i>Bismarck.</i>

225
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,227
May I suggest we put
Coastal Command to work...

226
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,669
on air reconnaissance?

227
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,068
Yes. Everything from Bergen southwards.

228
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,571
Tell them to photograph
everything that looks suspicious.

229
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:53,575
I'll talk to Commander-in-Chief
at Scapa Flow.

230
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,075
Aye aye, sir.

231
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,279
[Ship Horn Sounding]

232
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,110
[Ship Horn Sounding]

233
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,614
Excuse me, sir.

234
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:03,515
First sea lord on the line, sir.

235
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:10,215
Commander-in-Chief, sir.

236
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,722
Hello,Jack. How are you?

237
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,019
I'm fine.

238
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:14,525
Those two German ships...

239
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,027
were sighted off southern Norway
at 033 5.

240
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,528
One is the <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

241
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:21,031
and we're not sure about the other.

242
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:22,532
Do you think it's...

243
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,534
I suggest you proceed
on the worst possible assumption...

244
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,037
that it's <i>Bismarck</i>
and she's breaking out.

245
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,699
I can't think of anything worse.

246
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:33,900
We can't let that ship
get loose in the Atlantic.

247
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,534
I'll come to immediate notice
for steam, sir.

248
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,238
All right. Good-bye.

249
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:42,548
We're directed to assume
that it's <i>Bismarck...</i>

250
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,049
accompanied by <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

251
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,549
and that they're attempting to...

252
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,552
break out into the convoy lanes.

253
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,055
Now, gentlemen, they'd have
four available passages...

254
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,487
wouldn't they?

255
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,046
Here's the Denmark Strait...

256
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,058
the passage south of Iceland...

257
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,559
the Faeroes-Shetland Passage...

258
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,563
and the Fair Island Channel...

259
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,029
between the Orkneys and the Shetlands.

260
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,894
Anyone care to place a bet?

261
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,991
What about the Iceland-Faeroes
Channel?

262
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,933
Not too near our bases,
room to maneuver.

263
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,505
Why wouldn't he take the nearest exit?

264
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:13,371
Fair Island Channel's
only a few hundred miles.

265
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:15,533
Too close to our air patrol.

266
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:20,069
All you're saying is
it could be any one of the four.

267
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:22,081
Actually, of course,
you're perfectly right.

268
00:15:22,115 --> 00:15:23,548
I'm afraid somehow or other...

269
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,584
we've got to guard them all.

270
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,586
Have we any idea
where they are now, sir?

271
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,053
Nothing definite.

272
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,556
Jenkins, check with Coastal Command...

273
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,591
that they're carrying out a search.

274
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,058
Aye aye, sir.

275
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,326
Looks like two cruisers.

276
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,329
That's what the pilot said.

277
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,330
One's a cruiser, all right.

278
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,331
The other one's...

279
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,832
<i>Bismarck.</i>

280
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,459
<i>Bismarck's</i> been located in Norway.

281
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:29,763
Definitely identified.

282
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,326
<i>Bismarck's</i> in Grimstad Fjord.

283
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,838
They want us to send
everything we've got...

284
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:35,499
Bombers, torpedo planes, everything.

285
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:38,841
No luck. Nothing.

286
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,343
Visibility down to nil.

287
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,346
Cloud down to 200 feet, sir.

288
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,348
Can't get a bombing run
in weather like that.

289
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,349
200 feet along the fjord here.

290
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:47,751
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?

291
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,343
What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?

292
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,852
O.G.62, sir.

293
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,512
Right.

294
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,892
Now, Miss Davis, take the <i>Arethusa...</i>

295
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,892
from O.G.62.

296
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,327
Put her with the Home Fleet.

297
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,330
Good.

298
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,332
Now take the <i>Victorious...</i>

299
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,336
from that convoy forming
up in the Clyde...W.S.8.B....

300
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,837
And put her with the Home Fleet.

301
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,839
Sir, Operations Home Fleet calling.

302
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,340
Director of operations.

303
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,842
No, I'm sorry.
We still have no information.

304
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:22,343
Well, the weather's closed in
over there.

305
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,940
The aircraft can't see a thing.

306
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:29,177
Yes, as soon... as soon as I hear, right.

307
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,185
Right. I will.

308
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,188
Now...

309
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,191
take the <i>Repulse</i> from W.S.8.B.

310
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,955
and put her with the Home Fleet.

311
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,696
Right.

312
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,699
Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it?

313
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,928
Yes, sir, but I wouldn't give much
for the convoy.

314
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,233
You do recall that's a troop convoy...

315
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,430
don't you, sir?

316
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:55,563
Yes, I do.

317
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,732
They've got a long way to go...

318
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,742
round the cape to the Middle East.

319
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,140
This leaves them unprotected.

320
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,677
I'm quite aware of the circumstances,
Miss Davis.

321
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,442
This is a risk we have to take.

322
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,541
<i>We</i> have to take, sir?

323
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,481
Well, Shepard...

324
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:12,985
what do you have in mind?

325
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:16,182
I think we must reinforce
the Home Fleet, sir.

326
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:18,690
They can't patrol everything
from here to Greenland...

327
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:20,692
with what they've got now.

328
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,193
Well, where do we get the ships?

329
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,696
We'd have to take ships from other duty.

330
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,698
It would involve some risk.

331
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,097
We could take <i>Victorious</i>
and <i>Repulse</i> off escort duty.

332
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:33,762
That would give the Commander-in-Chief
an aircraft carrier...

333
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,305
and another battle cruiser.

334
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:36,737
What convoy were they covering?

335
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,240
The W.8.S.B., sailing
from the Clyde tomorrow.

336
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:42,744
It's a large troop convoy, sir...
20,000 men.

337
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,906
We'd be exposing them to
a long and dangerous voyage...

338
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,504
without proper escort.

339
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,743
Is that what you're recommending?

340
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,250
Yes, sir.

341
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:55,378
You're willing to gamble
the lives of 20,000 men?

342
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,923
I think there's a difference...

343
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:58,957
between a gamble and a calculated risk.

344
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,726
Good for you, Shepard.

345
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,887
Of course, I realize it's...

346
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,897
It's not an easy decision to make.

347
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:11,696
The important ones never are.

348
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,200
All right, go ahead...

349
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,703
and detach those two ships
from the convoy.

350
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,206
Inform Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

351
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,705
Aye aye, sir.

352
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,173
[Ship Horn Sounds]

353
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:25,211
They're giving us <i>Victorious</i>
and <i>Repulse.</i>

354
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:28,213
Now we can send <i>Hood</i>
and <i>Prince of Wales</i> out...

355
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,715
to support the patrols
in the Greenland area.

356
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:33,719
I want them ready to sail
within an hour.

357
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,219
<i>Prince of Wales</i>
has civilian workers aboard.

358
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,722
They're making adjustments
to the gun turrets.

359
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,226
If they don't finish their work,
they'll sail with the ship.

360
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,725
Aye aye, sir.

361
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:46,228
As far as the rest of the fleet...

362
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:48,230
we'll wait for definite information.

363
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:51,232
I suppose my nerves
can stand it if yours can.

364
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,234
I've just talked to Captain Shepard.

365
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,735
The visibility over the coast of Norway...

366
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,237
is absolutely nil.

367
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,239
She may be there. She may not.

368
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,933
What's the latest forecast?

369
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,736
Pretty bad, I'm afraid, sir.

370
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,243
Looks like two days
of very thick weather.

371
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,318
The weather report is
very good, Admiral...

372
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,318
Two days of heavy overcast.

373
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,355
Good news, is it not so, Captain?

374
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,856
It is, sir.

375
00:20:20,924 --> 00:20:22,289
Thank you, Bernhardt.

376
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:30,298
We have a most interesting
chess game here, Lindemann.

377
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:33,300
The important moves
this time are at the opening.

378
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:37,304
To break out into the Atlantic
will not be easy, sir.

379
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,805
Yes, but we have the advantage...

380
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,671
because they do not know
what we are going to do.

381
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,299
We can move out immediately...

382
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,810
or we can hide for a while...

383
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,312
under this beautiful overcast.

384
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,316
Also, we have a choice
of four different exits.

385
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,317
Group North has suggested
the Iceland-Faeroes Passage.

386
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,819
You're not forgetting that, sir?

387
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,320
We have to take orders from Group North.

388
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,256
We do not have to take suggestions.

389
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,758
Yes, sir.

390
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:06,759
Lindemann, we have
a great opportunity here.

391
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:09,160
I do not intend to let Group North...

392
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,392
or anyone else lose it for me.

393
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:13,762
There can be great glory in this voyage...

394
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,267
glory for the Third Reich...

395
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:18,304
glory for us!

396
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,203
For you, sir.
You are the fleet commander.

397
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,764
I will see that you are not forgotten.

398
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:26,776
I was forgotten after the last war.

399
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:28,777
Until the fuehrer came to power...

400
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,780
I got no recognition, no promotion.

401
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,280
I was ignored...

402
00:21:32,348 --> 00:21:34,282
just as Germany was ignored.

403
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,784
The world only remembers the winners,
Lindemann.

404
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,786
We must make sure this time...

405
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,584
that it will remember us.

406
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:43,886
I am sure it will.

407
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,790
How soon can you get under way?

408
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:48,794
I can have steam in half an hour, sir.

409
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,558
I want to be out of here
in 15 minutes.

410
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:53,065
Signal <i>Prinz Eugen.</i>

411
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:54,530
Very well, sir.

412
00:21:58,904 --> 00:22:00,997
[Whistles]

413
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:03,666
[Yelling In German]

414
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:34,299
Sir, it's a signal from
the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.

415
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,800
An aircraft from Hatston's
got through to Grimstad.

416
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,300
There's nothing there now, sir.

417
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:39,802
Well, they've sailed.

418
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,805
At least we know that much.

419
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,806
Now we can get moving.

420
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,760
Position of all convoys, sir.

421
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:11,920
Thank you.

422
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:15,762
All we can do now is wait
and see what happens.

423
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:18,768
That's the worst part
of our job...the waiting.

424
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:23,272
You have a son
in the service, haven't you?

425
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,931
Yes, sir. He's at Gibraltar.

426
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,270
He's an air gunner in the <i>Ark Royal.</i>

427
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,775
I bet you're glad...

428
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:32,301
he won't be mixed up
in this <i>Bismarck</i> show.

429
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,778
Why should I be glad?

430
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,782
If you were, you wouldn't admit it,
would you?

431
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,284
He must take his chance
like everybody else.

432
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,476
I see.

433
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,816
There's an air vice marshal
coming in later...

434
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,322
to help out on reconnaissance.

435
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,323
Give him a briefing, will you?

436
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,489
You wanted to speak to the crew,
Captain?

437
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:54,996
They've been alerted.

438
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:56,555
<i>Achtung!</i>

439
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,332
Captain Lindemann...

440
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,834
with your permission...

441
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:03,268
I would like to address
the ship's company.

442
00:24:03,338 --> 00:24:04,771
As you wish, sir.

443
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,932
Thank you.

444
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:11,776
Officers and men of the <i>Bismarck...</i>

445
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:13,609
this is the fleet commander.

446
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,081
We are going out into the North Atlantic...

447
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:19,447
to attack the British convoy system.

448
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:22,452
We are going to sink their ships...

449
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,612
until they no longer dare
to let them sail.

450
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:27,419
It's true we are only two ships...

451
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:31,291
but the world has never seen such ships.

452
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,794
We are sailing in the largest...

453
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,457
the most powerful battleship afloat...

454
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,965
superior to anything
in the British navy.

455
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,729
We are faster...

456
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:44,703
we are unsinkable, and we are German!

457
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:46,205
You cadet officers...

458
00:24:46,273 --> 00:24:48,298
you were selected by
the highest authority...

459
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,898
to make this voyage.

460
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,409
When you return to the fleet...

461
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:54,605
you will have many
inspiring stories to tell...

462
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,307
stories of German sea power...

463
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,283
stories of Nazi victory!

464
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:04,253
To all of you, I say this...

465
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:06,755
Never forget that you are Germans...

466
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,587
never forget that you are Nazis!

467
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:13,259
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

468
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,727
Heil Hitler!

469
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:22,795
In the center, the main plot.

470
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,801
What's that?

471
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,304
Another convoy, sir.

472
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:26,804
Fine. Carry on.

473
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,306
Now, sir...

474
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:31,810
over here, we have the <i>Hood</i>
and the <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

475
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:34,811
They left Scapa Flow 40 hours ago.

476
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,814
Here we have the <i>Repulse...</i>

477
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,315
the aircraft carrier <i>Victorious...</i>

478
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,316
and the <i>King George V.</i>

479
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:45,047
They've been steaming
for approximately 18 hours.

480
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:46,816
In this area...

481
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,050
the cruisers <i>Arethusa,
Manchester, Birmingham.</i>

482
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:50,819
In the Denmark Strait...

483
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,827
the cruisers <i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk.</i>

484
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:55,828
As you can see, sir...

485
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:59,196
our cruiser screen is
spread out much too thinly.

486
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,757
Now, if your people
would get into the air...

487
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,268
can't fly reconnaissance missions
in weather like this.

488
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:06,702
We realize that, of course, sir.

489
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:09,205
We must assume that the <i>Bismarck...</i>

490
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,708
in company with the <i>Prinz Eugen...</i>

491
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,767
is going to attempt a breakthrough...

492
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:15,276
to the North Atlantic.

493
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,778
We don't know where...

494
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,781
and we don't know when.

495
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,783
If it's here...

496
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,282
or here...

497
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,784
then the <i>Repulse</i> and the <i>Victorious...</i>

498
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:28,289
and the <i>K.G. V</i> will have to do the job.

499
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,789
If it's here in the Denmark Strait...

500
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,292
then the <i>Hood</i> and the <i>Prince of Wales...</i>

501
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,657
will have to go after her.

502
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,787
I should think they'd handle it.

503
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:41,300
<i>Hood's</i> a great ship.
So is the <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

504
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,300
She's fresh from the builder's yard.

505
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,800
No training for her crew.

506
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,805
She put to sea with the contractor's
workmen onboard.

507
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:52,365
The <i>Bismarck's</i> a tough proposition
for any two ships.

508
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:52,943
Excuse me, gentlemen.

509
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:53,875
Excuse me, gentlemen.

510
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,310
The first sea lord can see you now.

511
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:58,312
Thank you very much, Shepard.

512
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,472
[Telephone Rings]

513
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:00,845
Yes, sir.

514
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,281
Right, sir.

515
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,284
Yes, I will.

516
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,285
Commander Richards, who's your relief?

517
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:07,786
Dexter, sir.

518
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,289
He's late, isn't he?

519
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,290
A little. I don't mind, sir.

520
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:14,793
I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.

521
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,309
<i>My dearest Tom...</i>

522
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,311
Come in.

523
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,316
Thought you might like some tea, sir...

524
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,045
since you won't take any rest.

525
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:48,349
What are you doing here?
You're off duty.

526
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,321
Third Officer Simpson's down with flu.

527
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,823
I'm just filling in.

528
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:55,827
Oh, thank you. Would you file that
for me, please?

529
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,328
There's an air raid going on up top.

530
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,829
Bad one?

531
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:01,831
No, not very.

532
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:04,766
Won't your family be worried about you?

533
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,267
I have no family here.

534
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:09,270
My father lives in Canada now.

535
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:12,774
I thought that surely you must
be married or something.

536
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,934
No, sir. Nothing at all.

537
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:16,442
Doesn't that seem odd...

538
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,569
if you don't mind my saying so?

539
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:21,581
I was going to be married last year...

540
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:23,206
but...it didn't work out.

541
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:24,648
His fault or yours?

542
00:28:24,717 --> 00:28:26,150
He was at Dunkirk...

543
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:29,153
and he was listed as missing in action.

544
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,655
It was just a year ago...

545
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,020
a year ago next week.

546
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:37,793
He was a rather wonderful man...

547
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:41,319
not brilliant or dashing
or anything like that...

548
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,832
but just rather wonderful.

549
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:50,735
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,330
I think it helps to
talk about these things...

551
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:54,841
don't you, sir?

552
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:58,344
No, I don't.
I don't think it helps at all.

553
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,844
Getting emotional about things...

554
00:28:59,913 --> 00:29:01,346
is a peacetime luxury.

555
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:03,279
In wartime, it's much too painful.

556
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:05,282
You can't turn off your emotions...

557
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,284
just because there's a war on.

558
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:09,786
You can't do anything
about your feelings.

559
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,114
Yes, you can.

560
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:12,120
[Ring]

561
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,451
Director of operations.

562
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,287
Tell you why I called,Jonathan.

563
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:16,791
Dexter's here in my office...

564
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,849
and he has rather a special problem.

565
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:21,293
I understand you've given him
extra duty.

566
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:24,299
Correct. I'll require him for duty
the next three nights.

567
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:27,300
It seems that his girl is an army nurse.

568
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,495
She's got orders to sail tomorrow night.

569
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm very sorry that Dexter's young lady
is going overseas...

570
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,305
but that's beside the point.

571
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:35,807
Couldn't you make an exception?

572
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,309
I won't make an exception
for this officer...

573
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,809
or any other...

574
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:42,812
certainly not for reasons
of personal convenience.

575
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,576
Well, it's very simple, sir...

576
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,345
either you have discipline
or you haven't.

577
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:49,749
Well, I'm sorry, Dexter.

578
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,310
Thank you, sir.

579
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,321
By the way, Jonathan...

580
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,824
there's a fleet commander
aboard the <i>Bismarck.</i>

581
00:29:56,892 --> 00:30:00,182
Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens.

582
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:01,659
Lutjens.

583
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,163
You know this man?

584
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:04,664
Yes, sir, I do.

585
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:07,667
One of his cruisers sank my ship.

586
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:12,171
Oh. Then you'll have a special interest
in him.

587
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:23,202
Commander Richards,
have a bunk made up in my office.

588
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,373
Yes, sir.

589
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,712
I want the latest report
on all shipping...

590
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,217
in the North Atlantic...
enemy, friendly, neutral.

591
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,218
Any air reconnaissance over this area?

592
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,719
The weather's still too bad.

593
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,222
You show two cruisers
in the Denmark Strait.

594
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,722
Is <i>Suffolk</i> back on station?

595
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,726
We assume she is.
We don't know for certain.

596
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,226
She's quiet as a tomb.

597
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:55,739
Alter course to 1-9-0.

598
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,296
Starboard 15.

599
00:30:57,374 --> 00:30:59,069
Starboard 15, sir.

600
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:02,010
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

601
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:03,841
Bloody fool!

602
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,183
This blasted fog.

603
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,686
It's like looking into a cake of ice.

604
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,188
I can't see a thing.

605
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:16,689
You see something out there...

606
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,690
it will have 15-inch guns.

607
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,693
The <i>Bismarck's</i>
got a solid foot of armor plate.

608
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,193
Who said so?

609
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,695
The gunnery officer, that's who.

610
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:28,199
He said we might as well
throw crumpets at her.

611
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,703
I wish someone would
throw a crumpet at me.

612
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:38,502
Ship bearing green 4-5!

613
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:41,737
Two ships bearing green 4-5!

614
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:46,077
Hard aport! Full ahead both!

615
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,115
Hard aport. Full ahead both, sir.

616
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,719
Shall we follow them, sir?

617
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,325
Steady on 1-3-0.

618
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:05,363
Steady on 1-3-0!

619
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,863
Yeoman, make to admiralty.

620
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:09,695
<i>Bismarck</i> and cruiser sighted.

621
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,701
Course...south.

622
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,202
My position...
Give latitude and longitude.

623
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,702
Get that off immediately...

624
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:17,706
in case we run into trouble.

625
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:19,035
Aye aye, sir.

626
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:20,040
Check radar.

627
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:22,201
Check your radar plot.

628
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,212
Enemy report from <i>Suffolk,</i> sir.

629
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,214
They've found her.

630
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:31,216
Picked her up in the Denmark Strait.

631
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,683
<i>Bismarck</i> and a heavy cruiser.

632
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,719
66-45 north...

633
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,720
26 west.

634
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,723
There, gentlemen.

635
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,224
Course southwest.

636
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,724
Now things are looking up.

637
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,227
Tell the first sea lord
immediately.

638
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:48,731
Good job we've got
some heavy stuff in the area.

639
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,232
Richards, let me have
an intercepting course...

640
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,234
for <i>Hood</i> and <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

641
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,235
Sir, this one's from the <i>Norfolk.</i>

642
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:56,735
<i>Norfolk's</i> there, too, sir.

643
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:58,238
She's with <i>Suffolk.</i>

644
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,740
They're shadowing
in thick fog, using radar.

645
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:02,673
I hope that radar
works better than usual.

646
00:33:02,742 --> 00:33:05,302
She could blow them both
out of the water.

647
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,676
No. Lutjens is too clever for that.

648
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:10,181
He'd rather shake off a pair of cruisers...

649
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,682
than stop to sink them.

650
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,981
Course to intercept <i>Bismarck</i>
is 3-1-0.

651
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:17,486
That would bring <i>Hood</i> in contact...

652
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:19,853
just about...there.

653
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,357
Just about here, sir.

654
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,688
The intercepting course
is 3-1-0 degrees.

655
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,853
At full speed, we should make contact
at 0300.

656
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:29,193
I don't want to engage him
until daylight.

657
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:33,201
Give me a course and speed
to intercept at dawn.

658
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:34,701
Aye aye, sir.

659
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,203
At 27 knots... course 2-9-5...

660
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:39,705
we should meet them at first light.

661
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:42,207
We'll proceed on that course
at that speed.

662
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:44,743
Pass the word to <i>Prince of Wales.</i>

663
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:52,247
Signal from flag, sir.

664
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:54,784
Speed...27 knots.

665
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:56,251
200 revolutions.

666
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,253
Admiral's intentions follow, sir.

667
00:33:58,322 --> 00:33:59,755
Very good.

668
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:01,255
Wilson, tell the captain...

669
00:34:01,324 --> 00:34:03,189
we've gone onto 27 knots.

670
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,692
Also, the admiral's
sending his intentions.

671
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,196
Oh, Wilson, how are the civilian workers
enjoying themselves?

672
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:13,064
They're loving every moment of it, sir.

673
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:14,691
I'll tell you one thing...

674
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,202
I'm not sleeping in one of these
bloody hammocks.

675
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,703
Make a note, Walter...

676
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,205
to speak to the captain.

677
00:34:20,272 --> 00:34:22,206
We'll have double beds put in.

678
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,708
Very funny. I never even had a chance...

679
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:27,210
to tell me wife what was happening.

680
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:29,711
They thought
she might not let you go.

681
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:32,215
Imagine what she thinks I'm up to.

682
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:33,715
Pity she's wrong, isn't it?

683
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:35,216
She'll never believe this.

684
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:36,717
Where are we going?

685
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:41,052
We picked up speed.
What's that for in the night?

686
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,487
Captain speaking.

687
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:45,219
<i>Bismarck</i> has been sighted
in Denmark Strait.

688
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,751
She's on her way out into the Atlantic.

689
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:51,388
<i>We plan to tackle her
about dawn tomorrow morning.</i>

690
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,263
<i>You'll be going to action stations...</i>

691
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,393
<i>shortly after midnight.</i>

692
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,369
<i>I'm confident tomorrow is
going to be a big day for us.</i>

693
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:01,929
<i>Good luck and good shooting.</i>

694
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,169
They can't do this. I'm
in a reserved occupation.

695
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:10,179
I never thought
a thing like this would happen.

696
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:13,182
Fancy me fighting Germans
on the high seas.

697
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,185
Here, lad. You ever been in
a battle before?

698
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,684
Yeah, hundreds of times.

699
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:20,186
Don't hardly give it a thought anymore.

700
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,227
Latest plot report, sir.

701
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,729
<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk</i> still in contact.

702
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,732
<i>Hood</i> and <i>Prince of Wales...</i>

703
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,733
are estimated 120 miles from <i>Bismarck.</i>

704
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,235
Should be quite a show tomorrow morning.

705
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,237
I know where I'd rather be.

706
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,568
Excuse me, sir.

707
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:48,243
What a time for Shepard to take over.

708
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:51,246
I hope he's getting
all the help he needs.

709
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:56,478
Help, sir? I didn't think
he needed any help.

710
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,280
Captain Shepard is
a very old friend of mine.

711
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:03,482
You would be quite wrong
if you judged him too harshly.

712

00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:57,987
Then we will push forward...

894
00:46:58,054 --> 00:46:59,988
as instructed by the high command.

895
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:01,991
But surely the fuehrer must realize...

896
00:47:02,058 --> 00:47:05,926
Are you going to tell the fuehrer
what he must realize?

897
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:06,926
No, sir.

898
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:08,428
Then do not tell me.

899
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:09,929
For the time being...

900
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,431
we will hold our present
course and speed.

901
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,762
Yes, sir.

902
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,461
There will be no further
statement to the press...

903
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:17,969
not for the present.

904
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:20,472
Make a signal to admiral
commanding First Cruiser Squadron.

905
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,474
<i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk</i>
must maintain contact...

906
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,974
with the <i>Bismarck...</i>

907
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:25,977
so that Home Fleet can intercept.

908
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,979
Continue shadowing as long
as you have fuel to do so.

909
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,479
Excuse me, sir.

910
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,981
This is <i>Bismarck's</i> latest
position, course, and speed.

911
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,985
Send it to the C-in-C,
Home Fleet right away.

912
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:37,485
Now, Shepard.

913
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,487
At its present speed, sir...

914
00:47:39,554 --> 00:47:42,284
the Home Fleet cannot make
contact with <i>Bismarck...</i>

915
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:43,484
until tomorrow...

916
00:47:43,558 --> 00:47:46,652
and then only if she maintains
her present course.

917
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:48,285
What if she doesn't?

918
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:51,490
That's it exactly, sir.
They won't make contact at all.

919
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:53,499
Prime minister for you, sir.

920
00:47:58,403 --> 00:47:59,995
First sea lord here.

921
00:48:00,072 --> 00:48:01,505
Now, first sea lord...

922
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:04,439
I want to make it unmistakably clear...

923
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:06,942
that there is absolutely nothing
as vital...

924
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,445
to the nation at this moment...

925
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,242
as the destruction of the <i>Bismarck.</i>

926
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:14,442
You are authorized to employ...

927
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,144
any means at your disposal...

928
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:18,948
regardless of risk...

929
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,320
and regardless of the price
that must be paid.

930
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:27,452
This is a battle
we cannot afford to lose.

931
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:28,960
I understand, sir.

932
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:31,963
I don't care how you do it.

933
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,964
You must sink the <i>Bismarck.</i>

934
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:35,466
Good luck to you.

935
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:36,966
Thank you, sir.

936
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,974
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?

937
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,475
In my opinion, sir...

938
00:48:47,543 --> 00:48:50,478
we cannot leave this entirely
to the Home Fleet.

939
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:52,979
We must reach out and pull in...

940
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:55,016
everything we can lay our hands on.

941
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,017
I've ordered <i>Rodney</i> to leave her convoy.

942
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,018
She was the last available ship.

943
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,020
I don't suggest this lightly, sir.

944
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:03,453
Down here at Gibraltar, we've Force H...

945
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,957
<i>Renown, Sheffield, Ark Royal.</i>

946
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,959
We can't strip the Western Mediterranean...

947
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,961
with this Crete business going on.

948
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:11,462
Perhaps if we left <i>Ark Royal</i> down there...

949
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:13,963
and sent the other two out.

950
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:15,557
No, sir.

951
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:18,466
We may need <i>Ark Royal's</i> aircraft.

952
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,969
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?

953
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:22,972
It's taking a serious risk.

954
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,473
I know Shepard has weighed
that very carefully.

955
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,634
In view of what the prime minister said...

956
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,769
we don't seem to have much choice.

957
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:33,473
Well, I may be able
to argue with you two...

958
00:49:33,547 --> 00:49:35,981
but I can't quarrel
with the prime minister.

959
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,483
Order Force H to sail.

960
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:38,984

Oh, thanks.

969
00:49:58,568 --> 00:50:00,001
Thompson, where are you?

970
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:01,502

00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:07,007

973
00:50:07,075 --> 00:50:08,508
<i>that I'm always afraid...</i>

974
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,511
<i>there may be things
I will forget to mention.</i>

975
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,011
Marvelous. No letter again.

00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,514
Where are we off to this time?

977
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:17,015
Tom, is it true...

978
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:19,018
your father is director of operations?

979
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,518
I'm afraid it is.

980
00:50:20,586 --> 00:50:23,020
He's got a nerve, moving
us out of Gibraltar.

981
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,852
Tell him we don't want to go to sea.

982
00:50:25,924 --> 00:50:27,357
It's my fault, really.

983
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:30,485
I thought you blokes would like
a couple months in England.

984
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,528
You're kidding.

985
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,928
Not at all. My girl's in London.

986
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:38,297
You mean to say
you asked your father if...

987
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,563
They wouldn't dare, not in wartime.

988
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:43,069
Your father would do the same for you.

989
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:44,570
This is the captain.

990
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:47,402

No, no, boys!

994
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:08,524
If <i>Bismarck</i> holds her
present course and speed...

995
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:11,026
when's the earliest we can engage her?

996
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:14,028
9:00 tomorrow morning, sir,
at best possible speed.

997
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:17,030
If <i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Suffolk</i>
can keep track of her...

998
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,033
they can guide us in.

999
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,534
Suppose <i>Bismarck</i> gives them the slip?

1000
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:24,537
If she shakes off those cruisers
during the night...

1001
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:26,970
we may never get hold of her again.

1002
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,032
She's got the weather on her side, sir.

1003
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:31,543
Looks very bad for tonight.

1004
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,544
Slow her down before nightfall.

1005
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,547
Sommers, do you think <i>Victorious</i>
could launch an air strike?

1006
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:39,048
She's supposed to get
her deck landing training.

1007
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:42,552
Most of her pilots
have never flown off a carrier.

1008
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:46,055
I'm afraid they'll have to
start their training now.

1009
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:47,554
Detach <i>Victorious</i> from the fleet.

1010
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:50,057
Tell her to close <i>Bismarck</i> at 30 knots.

1011
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:52,059
She's to launch an air strike...

1012
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:54,061
when she's within 100 miles.

1013
00:51:54,128 --> 00:51:55,561

1014
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:05,502

she is to proceed on her course...

1016
00:52:07,072 --> 00:52:09,506
We will keep the enemy cruisers occupied...

1017
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:12,510

1018

Cease fire.

1036
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:13,325

Hold speed at 20 knots.

1072
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,268
In exactly two hours...

1073
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,271
we shall stop zigzagging...

1074
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:15,272
and proceed at full speed...

1075
00:56:15,374 --> 00:56:17,274
in whatever direction
we're headed.

1076
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:20,277
We will be out of radar range...

1077
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,778
before they realize they have lost us.

1078
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,785
This hit <i>Victorious</i> claims...

1079
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,787
it hasn't slowed <i>Bismarck</i> down at all.

1080
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:35,287
She's been zigzagging now...

1081
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,290
for more than two hours.

1082
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,223
That's odd.

1083
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:40,227
She must know we haven't...

1084
00:56:40,295 --> 00:56:42,229
any submarines in the area.

1085
00:56:42,296 --> 00:56:45,231
I wonder if <i>Victorious</i>
can get off another strike.

1086
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:47,232
I'm afraid not. It's too dark.

1087
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:49,735
Signal from <i>Norfolk</i>, sir.

1088
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:51,736
Yes? What is it?

1089
00:56:51,804 --> 00:56:54,238
Sir, they've lost contact with <i>Bismarck.</i>

1090
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:06,248
This is London.
Over 24 hours have passed...

1091
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:10,274
since the battleship <i>Bismarck</i>
destroyed HMS <i>Hood.</i>

1092
00:57:10,352 --> 00:57:12,752
Reportedly, the British
have attacked the <i>Bismarck...</i>

1093
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:14,755
with aircraft from a carrier...

1094
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:17,757
but Berlin says the attack
was beaten off successfully.

1095
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:20,760
Berlin adds that <i>Bismarck</i>
was able subsequently...

1096
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,294
to shake off the surface vessels
pursuing her.

1097
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,455
The German battleship has survived...

1098
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:28,624
the heaviest guns and ships
in the British navy...

1099
00:57:28,701 --> 00:57:30,794
and the gloomy speculation now is...

1100
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:33,803
that the British navy
may have trouble finding her...

1101
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:35,304
let alone destroying her.

1102
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,273
Of one thing we can be sure...

1103
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:41,072
The lights will burn late
in the admiralty tonight.

1104
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:41,610
This is her last known position...

1105
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:44,238
This is her last known position...

1106
00:57:44,312 --> 00:57:45,779
and this...

1107
00:57:47,982 --> 00:57:49,415
her farthest on.

1108
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:53,443
That means she has to be
somewhere inside that circle.

1109
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,752
In this sector, search aircraft
from <i>Victorious.</i>

1110
00:57:56,823 --> 00:57:59,291
To the south and west...

1111
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:02,294
cruisers <i>Suffolk</i> and <i>Norfolk.</i>

1112
00:58:02,328 --> 00:58:03,795
That leaves two possibilities.

1113
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:06,297
Either she's broken back to Germany...

1114
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,424
or she's headed for
one of the French ports.

1115
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,303
Now, Miss Davis...

1116
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:16,305
if you were <i>Bismarck</i>, what would you do?

1117
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:19,308
Well, I suppose I'm not very brave.

1118
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:21,309
I'd head for home, sir.

1119
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:24,312
And a very sensible thing to do, too.

1120
00:58:24,345 --> 00:58:27,109
Plenty of fuel, good repair facilities...

1121
00:58:27,214 --> 00:58:29,114
complete protection.

1122
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:31,185
But not Lutjens...

1123
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:33,719
or any other German fleet commander.

1124
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:34,742
Why not?

1125
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,755
Because in Nazi Germany, he'd lose face.

1126
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:39,687
I've fought these people before.

1127
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:42,728
They have to prove
their superiority every day.

1128
00:58:42,761 --> 00:58:44,729
That's their one tremendous weakness.

1129
00:58:44,762 --> 00:58:45,694
Sir.

1130
00:58:45,763 --> 00:58:46,730
Yes?

1131
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,730
Signal from the Commander-in-Chief.

1132
00:58:48,765 --> 00:58:51,233
"<i>King George V</i> running short of fuel.

1133
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,565
Can't maintain full speed much longer."

1134
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:56,934
[Telephone Rings]

1135
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:01,774
Supposing she is heading
for a French port.

1136
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,275
Won't be long...

1137
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:05,777
before she gets
friendly submarine support...

1138
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,278
and complete air cover.

1139
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,280
Too late to stop her then.

1140
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:11,781
<i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> at Brest.

1141
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:14,285
Supposing <i>Bismarck</i> joins up with them...

1142
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:18,288
and all three of them
decide to come out together.

1143
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,947
What then?

1144
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,718
[Door Opens]

1145
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,226
What's the trouble?

1146
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,726
He just collapsed, sir.

1147
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,729
Take him in the office.

1148
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,789
Why is this man on duty if he's sick?

1149
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:32,298
I don't know, sir.
He didn't report sick.

1150
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,800
Get someone over here.

1151
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,963
Aye aye, sir. Simms, take over.

1152
00:59:38,305 --> 00:59:40,239
All right. Leave him here.

1153
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:41,740
Aye aye, sir.

1154
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:42,798
Sorry, sir.

1155
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:45,710
Why the devil
didn't you report sick?

1156
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:47,245
I'm sorry, sir.

1157
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:50,714
I didn't want to miss anything.

1158
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:52,216
All right, Brown.

1159
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,219
We'll get you along to the sick bay.

1160
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:57,982
If anything happens, I'll let you know.

1161
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,521
Thank you, sir.

1162
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:02,024
What time is it, Miss Davis?

1163
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:03,526
About 6:30, sir.

1164
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,027
Morning or evening?

1165
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,028
It's a very fine morning.

1166
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,031
I think you should take a short walk.

1167
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,033
You haven't been outside
for five days.

1168
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,264
Take down this message
for Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet...

1169
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:19,271
Our interpretation
of best available information...

1170
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:22,273
indicates <i>Bismarck</i>
heading for the coast of France.

1171
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:24,003
Proceed accordingly.

1172
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:27,273
Sir, must you stick your neck out
quite so far?

1173
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:30,280
I'm afraid that goes with the job.

1174
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,281
To admiral commanding Force H...

1175
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:33,782
Proceed to intercept <i>Bismarck...</i>

1176
01:00:33,851 --> 01:00:36,285
on assumption she's headed for Brest.

1177
01:00:36,353 --> 01:00:39,254
Suggest search by aircraft
from <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1178
01:00:39,288 --> 01:00:42,791
Your son is in <i>Ark Royal</i>, isn't he, sir?

1179
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:44,281
Yes. Yes, he is.

1180
01:00:44,327 --> 01:00:46,795
Get that off immediately,
will you?

1181
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,260
Come in.

1182
01:01:28,328 --> 01:01:30,228
Come in, Miss Davis.

1183
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,229
Signal for you, sir.

1184
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,730
Thank you.

1185
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:42,170
This is a report on the
<i>Ark Royal's</i> air search.

1186
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:44,173
They haven't found a thing.

1187
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,673
Better tell Captain Shepard.

1188
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,971
Yes, sir.

1189
01:01:47,044 --> 01:01:49,171
Also, two of <i>Ark Royal's</i> aircraft...

1190
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:51,179
failed to return to the carrier.

1191
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:54,181
No need to tell him that,
I should think.

1192
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:57,707
By the way, how would you like
a trip to America?

1193
01:01:57,752 --> 01:01:59,117
America, sir?

1194
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:01,814
The admiralty's sending a mission over...

1195
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:04,413
Two regular officers and a Wren officer.

1196
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,685
The board picked you as first choice.

1197
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,250
It sounds very exciting.

1198
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:10,886
There will be no change, of course...

1199
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:13,397
until this <i>Bismarck</i> thing is settled.

1200
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,592
Aye aye, sir. Thank you very much.

1201
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:19,694
Yes, it would have to be
long-range aircraft...

1202
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,362
Catalinas, I should think.

1203
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,701
Yes, that's right. Call me back.

1204
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:24,899
Shepard.

1205
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,065
Sir?

1206
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,235
Seems our forces
are very heavily committed...

1207
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,245
to a single course of action.

1208
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:33,804
Is that based on the definite knowledge
that <i>Bismarck...</i>

1209
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:35,745
is headed for a French port?

1210
01:02:35,816 --> 01:02:38,614
On definite knowledge?
No, sir.

1211
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:40,687
It's based on my summing up...

1212
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,345
of the general situation.

1213
01:02:42,422 --> 01:02:45,186
It was a decision that had to be made.

1214
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:47,225
I hope you're right, Shepard.

1215
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:49,523
I hope to God you're right.

1216
01:02:49,628 --> 01:02:51,687
A report from <i>Ark Royal,</i> sir.

1217
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:53,229
They haven't found anything.

1218
01:02:53,264 --> 01:02:54,731
All right.

1219
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:56,732
Are you off now, Miss Davis?

1220
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,235
Yes, sir. My watch ends at 7:00.

1221
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,238
I seem to have a lot of work
to do.

1222
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:04,239
Could you stay and help me out?

1223
01:03:04,273 --> 01:03:06,241
Of course. I have a dinner date...

1224
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:08,242
but that's not until 9:00.

1225
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:10,244
Let me have the latest
information...

1226
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:12,246
on available aircraft
in Force H.

1227
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:13,746
Aye aye, sir.

1228
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,248
"Coastal command will activate
two crossover air patrols.

1229
01:03:16,282 --> 01:03:19,251
"The northern-most will cover
possible enemy courses...

1230
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:21,253
"from Brest to La Rochelle.

1231
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:24,745
The southern-most
will cover La Rochelle
to Cape Finisterre."

1232
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:27,758
If you'll coordinate that
with Coastal Command...

1233
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,761
I'll get on with the business
of Force H...

1234
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:33,262
and you can enjoy your dinner date.

1235
01:03:33,297 --> 01:03:36,266
At half-past one in the morning, sir?

1236
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:38,061
Oh, I'm sorry.

1237
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,499
I had no idea what time it was.

1238
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:42,434
By the way, Miss Davis...

1239
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:44,404
I'd like to make arrangements...

1240
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:46,599
for you to work with me full-time...

1241
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:48,505
if you can face it.

1242
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,510
What I had in mind...

1243
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,240
was to make you my assistant.

1244
01:03:54,314 --> 01:03:56,908
I appreciate you thinking of me, sir.

1245
01:03:56,981 --> 01:04:00,246
I need someone who's intelligent
and dependable...

1246
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,412
Quite honestly, someone like yourself.

1247
01:04:02,487 --> 01:04:05,251
Well... what do you say?

1248
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:08,324
I don't know quite what to say, sir.

1249
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:11,326
I'd make an effort not to be so rude...

1250
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,124
as I have been in the past...

1251
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,130
if that's what's bothering you.

1252
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,131
It isn't anything like that.

1253
01:04:18,232 --> 01:04:20,462
If you want to say no,
please say so.

1254
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:21,369
Well, you see...

1255
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:22,131
Well, you see...

1256
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:24,034
[Telephone Rings]

1257
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,299
Director of operations.

1258
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,366
One moment, please, sir.

1259
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:36,643
It's Captain Farnum... Casualty Section.

1260
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:03,768
Hello, Richard. Yes?

1261
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,929
What sort of bad news?

1262
01:05:13,378 --> 01:05:15,278
Is there no other information?

1263
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,780
I see.

1264
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,284
Yes. I appreciate your telling me.

1265
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,944
Thank you, Richard.

1266
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:36,790
My son's missing.

1267
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:39,228
His plane ran out of fuel...

1268
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,926
and failed to return.

1269
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,229
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1270
01:05:43,302 --> 01:05:45,236
There's a good chance...

1271
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,237
he'll be picked up.

1272
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:49,033
<i>You</i> were picked up.

1273
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,768
When I got out of hospital...

1274
01:05:51,843 --> 01:05:55,301
all I could think about
was getting back to London.

1275
01:05:55,345 --> 01:05:57,973
I wanted to see my wife.

1276
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:00,379
I took a taxi from Waterloo.

1277
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:03,782
As I drove into Welbeck Place...

1278
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:06,787
everything looked so familiar.

1279
01:06:06,855 --> 01:06:11,315
Every house was just as I remembered it.

1280
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,953
Every house except mine.

1281
01:06:17,363 --> 01:06:20,821
There was a large
black hole in the ground...

1282
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:22,800
where my house had been...

1283
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:26,269
uh... where my wife had been.

1284
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:35,275
I didn't think it was possible
to feel such pain.

1285
01:06:36,879 --> 01:06:38,312
I know.

1286
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,474
I've been through it myself, and I know.

1287
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:44,745
I swore that night I'd never again...

1288
01:06:44,819 --> 01:06:47,788
get emotionally attached
to a human being...

1289
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:50,289
as long as I lived...

1290
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:53,292
but I made one mistake.

1291
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:55,293
I forgot about...

1292
01:06:55,327 --> 01:06:57,386
I forgot about my son.

1293
01:06:57,496 --> 01:07:00,260
You can't avoid pain
by fencing yourself off.

1294
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:03,094
Sometimes you need
the help of other people...

1295
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,758
more than anything else...

1296
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:08,202
but you have to let them get
close enough to help.

1297
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:10,272
I don't want any help.

1298
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:13,308
I found when I was deeply troubled...

1299
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:16,310
that I needed people very badly.

1300
01:07:16,344 --> 01:07:18,312
People want to be needed.

1301
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:19,938
I found that out, too.

1302
01:07:20,014 --> 01:07:21,538
We're in business again.

1303
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:24,777
<i>Bismarck's</i> been spotted
by a Catalina flying boat...

1304
01:07:24,852 --> 01:07:26,319
headed for Brest.

1305
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:28,343
Your hunch was right, sir.

1306
01:07:28,387 --> 01:07:29,854
Excuse me.

1307
01:07:29,888 --> 01:07:31,856
Sir, Captain Shepard has offered me...

1308
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,858
a new job to be his assistant.

1309
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:36,052
I'd like very much to take it.

1310
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,219
I hope you'll have no objection.

1311
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:40,924
Jonathan, what have you
done to that girl?

1312
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:43,761
She's just been offered
a marvelous opportunity...

1313
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:46,130
to go to America.
It means sure promotion.

1314
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:49,263
She's turning that down
to stay here with you.

1315
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,270
I don't understand it.

1316
01:07:51,372 --> 01:07:52,771
Here's the situation...

1317
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:55,775
The flying boat spotted
<i>Bismarck</i> at 1030

1318
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:57,777
and has been shadowing ever since...

1319
01:07:57,878 --> 01:07:59,140
using cloud cover.

1320
01:07:59,213 --> 01:08:00,771
Jonathan.

1321
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:02,781
I'm sorry, sir.

1322
01:08:02,882 --> 01:08:04,782
You were saying...

1323
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:07,283
the flying boat spotted
<i>Bismarck</i> at 1030

1324
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:09,286
and has been shadowing ever since...

1325
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:10,786
using cloud cover.

1326
01:08:10,888 --> 01:08:13,118
From time to time, <i>Bismarck</i> has put up...

1327
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,953
very heavy anti-aircraft fire.

1328
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,303
By now, the British know where we are.

1329
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:32,304
They'll send out everything they have.

1330
01:08:32,405 --> 01:08:34,805
We can sink anything they send out.

1331
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:36,808
What was your latest fuel report?

1332
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,741
We've lost about 200 tons...

1333
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,745
from the tanks that were damaged.

1334
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:42,246
We have 3 5% left.

1335
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:44,248
That is more than enough.

1336
01:08:44,315 --> 01:08:46,249
I want to check the plot.

1337
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:48,750
Becker, keep me informed
about the fuel situation.

1338
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,176
I will, sir.

1339
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,586
I've requested air cover
from the <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

1340
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:55,624
How soon can we expect
them to be with us?

1341
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:57,626
Shore-based aircraft can operate...

1342
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,128
approximately that far
from the coast, sir.

1343
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:02,129
We will arrive at that point...

1344
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:03,596
about dawn tomorrow.

1345
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:05,633
What about <i>King George</i> and <i>Rodney?</i>

1346
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,634
What is their position now?

1347
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:09,669
Based on reports from Group West...

1348
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,136
I have them plotted...

1349
01:09:11,205 --> 01:09:13,673
200 miles to the north of us.

1350
01:09:13,705 --> 01:09:15,138
That is good.

1351
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:17,675
They cannot possibly overtake us now.

1352
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:20,679
A day or so in Brest to make repairs...

1353
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:23,976
and then we come out again
with our tanks full.

1354
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:28,644
Also, Lindemann... I have an idea.

1355
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:32,677
Suppose <i>Scharnhorst</i>
and <i>Gneisenau</i> came out with us.

1356
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:36,179
We would be the most powerful
fleet that ever sailed.

1357
01:09:36,224 --> 01:09:39,091
Nothing in the world could touch us.

1358
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:40,924
Excuse me, sir. Personal signal...

1359
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:42,587
for the fleet commander.

1360
01:09:42,663 --> 01:09:44,096
Thank you, Mueller.

1361
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:50,101
"Best wishes on your birthday."

1362
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:51,602
Look.

1363
01:09:53,172 --> 01:09:54,764
Adolf Hitler.

1364
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:00,109
This is a great honor.

1365
01:10:00,178 --> 01:10:03,113
Yes, please. Right.

1366
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,113
Here are the fuel consumption reports...

1367
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:07,115
for <i>K.G. V</i> and <i>Rodney</i>, sir...

1368
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:09,617
as close as I can calculate them.

1369
01:10:09,686 --> 01:10:11,620
Don't look too good, do they?

1370
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:14,178
They're 140 miles astern of <i>Bismarck.</i>

1371
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:17,225
Can they steam at full speed
long enough to overtake her?

1372
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,226
They wouldn't have enough fuel
to get home.

1373
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:23,628
Sir.

1374
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,633
By daylight tomorrow, <i>Bismarck</i> will be...

1375
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:30,635
in range of German air cover.

1376
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:32,637
They'll send out the whole <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

1377
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:34,638
And a line of U-boats.

1378
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:37,140
We have to slow her down by tonight...

1379
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:39,072
so Home Fleet can overtake her...

1380
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:41,075
before she gets into friendly waters.

1381
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,578
<i>Renown</i> and <i>Sheffield</i> can't do it.

1382
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:45,580
That leaves <i>Ark Royal</i>.

1383
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:49,583
10 hours of daylight left.

1384
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:51,117
Call it 9 1/2.

1385
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:54,121
There's time to get off
one air strike anyway.

1386
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,622
With luck, they might get off two.

1387
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:58,123
Yes, sir.

1388
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:01,126
We'd better get in touch with <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1389
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:11,101
Your torpedoes have been fitted
with new magnetic exploders...

1390
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:13,104
so you should get good results.

1391
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:14,763
You have <i>Bismarck's</i> position...

1392
01:11:14,838 --> 01:11:16,271
course, and speed.

1393
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:19,570
She's now 2 4 miles away,
bearing 183 degrees.

1394
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:22,610
She's all by herself,
so make your attack immediately.

1395
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,612
Oh, there's just one final word.

1396
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:26,614
The Home Fleet's 100 miles astern.

1397
01:11:26,647 --> 01:11:30,105
Unless you stop <i>Bismarck</i> today,
they'll never catch her.

1398
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:33,243
It's up to you, gentlemen. Good day.

1399
01:11:49,098 --> 01:11:51,532
The <i>Sheffield's</i> been detached
from the flagship, sir.

1400
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:54,537
She was ordered to close
<i>Bismarck</i> and shadow her.

1401
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:56,037
How long ago?

1402
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,038
1 1/2 hours.

1403
01:11:58,106 --> 01:11:59,539
1 1/2 hours?

1404
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,542
It wasn't decoded immediately, sir...

1405
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,543
because it wasn't addressed to us.

1406
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,545
We just happened to pick it up, sir.

1407
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,547
Our pilots have orders to attack...

1408
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,548
any ship alone in that area.

1409
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:12,049
Send a message to all aircraft...

1410
01:12:12,117 --> 01:12:13,709
"Look out for <i>Sheffield.</i>"

1411
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:16,051
Send it in plain language
immediately.

1412
01:12:16,121 --> 01:12:17,554
Aye aye, sir.

1413
01:12:17,622 --> 01:12:19,988
Bit of a cockup somewhere.

1414
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:41,870
It's the <i>Bismarck</i>, all right!

1415
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,545
It's all right. They're ours...swordfish.

1416
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,051
Sounds as if they're going to fly
right over us, sir.

1417
01:12:53,117 --> 01:12:55,551
They're using our position
to get their bearings.

1418
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,054
I can see them now, sir. There they are.

1419
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:01,112
They're attacking us!

1420
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:06,260
Full ahead both! Hard aport!

1421
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:08,956
All guns, hold your fire!

1422
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:15,893
Torpedo exploded
as it hit the water, sir.

1423
01:13:17,472 --> 01:13:18,962
There's another one.

1424
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:26,443
They're exploding short.
What's the matter?

1425
01:13:26,512 --> 01:13:28,639
It's those damn magnetic exploders.

1426
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,274
Here comes one that didn't explode, sir.

1427
01:13:35,352 --> 01:13:36,683
Hard astarboard.

1428
01:13:36,753 --> 01:13:38,118
Hard astarboard.

1429
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:47,784
That was the <i>Sheffield</i>, sir...
just came from the carrier.

1430
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:49,796
Signal the other aircraft.

1431
01:13:49,864 --> 01:13:52,697
Tell them to break off the attack.

1432
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,290
Wheel amidships.

1433
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:55,800
Wheel amidships, sir.

1434
01:14:07,879 --> 01:14:10,313
We all feel the same
about what's happened...

1435
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,439
so there's no point in discussing it.

1436
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:15,349
Let's just say we've learned
a very important lesson...

1437
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,851
which may well prove
a blessing in disguise.

1438
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,514
All right, let's get on with the job.

1439
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,853
There's still enough light
for one more attack.

1440
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,687
Think you're up to it?

1441
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:26,726
Yes, but what about
those magnetic exploders?

1442
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:28,194
They're being changed.

1443
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,231
We'll go back to contact exploders.

1444
01:14:30,296 --> 01:14:32,856
Keep your seats, gentlemen.

1445
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:38,131
I have a message here
from the Commander-in-Chief.

1446
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:41,297
"Unless the enemy's speed
has been reduced by midnight...

1447
01:14:41,373 --> 01:14:44,831
"<i>King George V</i> will
have to abandon the chase...

1448
01:14:44,874 --> 01:14:46,842
and turn back for refueling."

1449
01:14:46,877 --> 01:14:49,846
There's no need to tell you
what that means.

1450
01:14:49,879 --> 01:14:52,040
This is our last chance, gentlemen.

1451
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:55,811
I suggest you go below
and get something to eat.

1452
01:14:55,884 --> 01:14:58,853
You'll be taking off at 1830.

1453
01:15:02,523 --> 01:15:04,320
[Bells Ringing]

1454
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:27,775
Skipper! Ship bearing green 4-5.

1455
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,380
This is it, boys! Come on, let's go!

1456
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:50,491
Hard astarboard!

1457
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:24,187
Where was that?

1458
01:16:24,256 --> 01:16:26,190
Amidships. No serious damage, sir.

1459
01:16:26,258 --> 01:16:27,691
Thank you, Mueller.

1460
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:29,886
Tell damage control to keep us informed.

1461
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:38,298
Hard astarboard!

1462
01:17:00,118 --> 01:17:01,915
Hard aport!

1463
01:17:09,893 --> 01:17:12,327
[Buzzer]

1464
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,828
Captain.

1465
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,160
Hit in the steering compartment, sir.

1466
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,200
Put your rudder amidships.

1467
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,495
Rudder amidships.

1468
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:29,170
The rudder won't move, sir.

1469
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,815
What ships are these?

1470
01:17:39,884 --> 01:17:41,317
The 4th Destroyer Flotilla, sir.

1471
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:42,818
They're getting close.

1472
01:17:42,887 --> 01:17:46,345
We picked up two
very peculiar reports
from Coastal Command...

1473
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:47,822
following the attack by <i>Ark Royal.</i>

1474
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:49,858
The first one says,
"<i>Bismarck</i> circling."

1475
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:52,360
The second one reads,
"<i>Bismarck</i> heading nor-norwest."

1476
01:17:52,395 --> 01:17:55,262
Nor-norwest?
That's impossible, sir.

1477
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,766
She'd be headed straight
for <i>K.G. V</i> and <i>Rodney.</i>

1478
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,266
Sounds like faulty identification.

1479
01:18:00,334 --> 01:18:01,767
Wrong ship, most likely.

1480
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,665
Sir? Signal from <i>Sheffield.</i>

1481
01:18:03,737 --> 01:18:05,329
They made contact with <i>Bismarck.</i>

1482
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:07,100
She's steering north at 10 knots.

1483
01:18:08,907 --> 01:18:10,340
That's incredible!

1484
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:11,841
It must be <i>Bismarck.</i>

1485
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:14,504
But what's she doing on that course...

1486
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:17,343
and at a speed of 10 knots?

1487
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:19,882
Hit by a torpedo, I'll bet...

1488
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:20,849
and damaged.

1489
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:22,350
Propellers?

1490
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:23,850
Could be, sir.

1491
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,353
Or rudder, can't maneuver.

1492
01:18:25,421 --> 01:18:27,889
We've got a chance now, sir.

1493
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:29,891
I think we've got a chance.

1494
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:43,495
Yes.

1495
01:18:43,569 --> 01:18:45,298
It's the <i>Bismarck</i>, all right.

1496
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:46,804
Yeoman?

1497
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:48,305
Sir?

1498
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:51,309
Make to <i>Solent...</i>
intend to attack with torpedoes.

1499
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,808
Ships turning to port.

1500
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:54,309
Firing range 4,000 yards.

1501
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:55,744
Aye aye, sir.

1502
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:57,110
Bring on 30 knots.

1503
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,477
300 revolutions.

1504
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:01,812
[Yeoman] From Captain D, sir.

1505
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:03,818
Speed 30 knots.

1506
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:06,320
Turning to port to fire torpedoes.

1507
01:19:06,388 --> 01:19:07,821
Firing range 4,000 yards.

1508
01:19:07,889 --> 01:19:10,449
Good! Then it is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1509
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:17,364
Damage control.

1510
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:18,364
Damage control.

1511
01:19:18,431 --> 01:19:20,797
Damage control, sir.

1512
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:22,356
Captain speaking.

1513
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:24,902
I want a report on that rudder.

1514
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,904
The divers are down now.

1515
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,599
They'll be up in a moment, sir.

1516
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:39,345
Range 6,000 yards, sir.

1517
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,310
Yes.

1518
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:45,818
I see.

1519
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:48,321
It's impossible
to free the rudder, sir.

1520
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:50,822
It was jammed too badly
by the explosion.

1521
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:52,324
How early in the morning...

1522
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:55,827
can you put a couple
of divers over the side?

1523
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:57,328
At first light, sir...

1524
01:19:57,396 --> 01:19:59,830
about 5:00 if the sea is not too rough.

1525
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:01,832
I do not care about the sea.

1526
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:04,333
I was thinking about the men, sir.

1527
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:05,834
Sir, from fleet commander.

1528
01:20:05,904 --> 01:20:07,337
Thank you.

1529
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,841
Ah.

1530
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:17,345
"Group West is sending out three
seagoing tugs.

1531
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,347
"All submarines
in the area have been ordered...

1532
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,349
to concentrate at this point."

1533
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:23,848
That is good.

1534
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:25,282
That is very good.

1535
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:29,881
Range 5,000.

1536
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:35,092
Attention all hands.

1537
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:36,854
Attention all hands.

1538
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:40,294
This is the fleet commander.

1539
01:20:40,364 --> 01:20:41,797
We are having some difficulty...

1540
01:20:41,865 --> 01:20:44,459
repairing the damage
to our steering gear...

1541
01:20:44,533 --> 01:20:48,333
but I assure you
there is no cause for alarm.

1542
01:20:48,405 --> 01:20:50,100
4,500 yards, sir.

1543
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:52,139
Stand by the torpedo tubes.

1544
01:20:52,173 --> 01:20:53,936
Stand by the torpedo tubes.

1545
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,602
By morning, we will be in good hands.

1546
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,668
And if the British Home Fleet...

1547
01:20:58,712 --> 01:21:00,680
should be foolish enough to appear...

1548
01:21:00,714 --> 01:21:03,239
they will be torpedoed by U-boats.

1549
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:05,284
Meanwhile, let me remind you...

1550
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,376
that our guns have not been damaged.

1551
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:10,718
This is still the most
powerful ship afloat.

1552
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:15,224
I have in my hand a message...

1553
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:16,816
addressed to the entire crew.

1554
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:19,987
"All Germany is at your side.

1555
01:21:20,063 --> 01:21:24,227
"Your gallantry is
an inspiration to our people.

1556
01:21:24,299 --> 01:21:27,234
"You will forever occupy
a place of honor...

1557
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:32,261
in the history of the Third Reich."

1558
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,502
This message is signed by the fuehrer.

1559
01:21:35,575 --> 01:21:37,042
Range 4,000 yards, sir.

1560
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:40,204
Port 20, fire when the sights come on.

1561
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:47,183
Two enemy destroyers on port bow, sir.

1562
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:48,718
Alarm port.

1563
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:49,912
Alarm port, sir!

1564
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,081
[Alarm]

1565
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:00,361
Range 4,000, bearing 300 degrees.

1566
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:01,861
Guns ready port.

1567
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,363
Guns ready port, sir.

1568
01:22:03,431 --> 01:22:05,194
Illuminate with star shell.

1569
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:08,031
Illuminate with star shell.

1570
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,473
They've seen us!

1571
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,338
Now we're for it!

1572
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:19,707
20 degrees to go, sir.

1573
01:22:19,779 --> 01:22:21,076
Fire!

1574
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,712
All torpedoes gone, sir.

1575
01:22:27,784 --> 01:22:30,252
Let's get out of here. Hard aport.

1576
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:31,481
Open fire main armament.

1577
01:22:39,394 --> 01:22:40,827
Torpedo hit amidship, sir.

1578
01:22:40,896 --> 01:22:42,727
Good man!

1579
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:43,785
Fire!

1580
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:54,933
She's got the <i>Solent.</i>

1581
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:56,702
Good shooting, Lindemann.

1582
01:22:56,774 --> 01:22:58,207
Cease firing! Cease firing!

1583
01:22:58,275 --> 01:23:01,711
One hit on the armor
near the forward boiling room.

1584
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,213
The damage can be repaired...

1585
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,544
and it won't affect our speed, sir.

1586
01:23:05,615 --> 01:23:06,877
Thank you.

1587
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,144
That is good.

1588
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:13,220
Destroyers are still shadowing, sir.

1589
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,724
They have orders
to keep track of the <i>Bismarck...</i>

1590
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,224
until the Home Fleet closes.

1591
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:20,225
They claim three hits with torpedoes.

1592
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:22,227
It hasn't even slowed her down.

1593
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:24,730
What about the reports
of enemy submarines?

1594
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:26,230
A.C.N.S. says these have been confirmed.

1595
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,731
I've notified the Commander-in-Chief.

1596
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,098
What is C-in-C doing about it?

1597
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:31,636
He hasn't altered his plans.

1598
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,637
I'd like to send him a signal...

1599
01:23:33,705 --> 01:23:34,967
telling him to be careful...

1600
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:36,370
but I'm sure he'd resent it.

1601
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:39,998
Cigarette?

1602
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:41,406
Thank you, no, sir.

1603
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:43,503
I'll be here if you want me.

1604
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,309
Shepard?

1605
01:23:45,381 --> 01:23:47,815
Sorry about your son.

1606
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:51,745
Yes, sir.

1607
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,025
Captain Shepard, sir.

1608
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,525
Hmm?

1609
01:24:01,593 --> 01:24:03,026
Excuse me, sir.

1610
01:24:03,096 --> 01:24:04,529
I took in an operational signal...

1611
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:06,531
from one of the destroyers
shadowing the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1612
01:24:06,598 --> 01:24:09,567
They picked up three flyers
in a rubber boat.

1613
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,034
Must have been over an hour ago...

1614
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:14,037
so I couldn't get off in time.

1615
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:15,537
I heard about your son...

1616
01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:17,539
so I thought I'd tell you.

1617
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:20,041
It might not be him at all, sir...

1618
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,076
but you never know.

1619
01:24:22,143 --> 01:24:24,077
Thank you.

1620
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:26,080
Thank you very much.

1621
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:34,586
Oh, sir, A.C.N.S. has been calling you.

1622
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:36,088
Says it's very urgent.

1623
01:24:57,606 --> 01:24:59,540
Assistant chief of staff, please.

1624
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:01,041
Yes, sir.

1625
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:05,374
Hello, sir. Shepard here.

1626
01:25:05,446 --> 01:25:07,744
Jonathan, I've got
the most marvelous news.

1627
01:25:07,815 --> 01:25:09,407
Your son is alive and well.

1628
01:25:09,482 --> 01:25:11,416
He's been picked up by a destroyer.

1629
01:25:13,619 --> 01:25:15,052
This is absolutely official.

1630
01:25:15,121 --> 01:25:17,555
Farnum got the message half an hour ago.

1631
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:21,555
Jonathan?

1632
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:22,923
Don't you understand,Jonathan?

1633
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:26,088
Your son is alive and well.

1634
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:29,064
[Click]

1635
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:33,691
What did he say, sir?

1636
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:35,133
He didn't say anything.

1637
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,199
Well, will you excuse me, sir?

1638
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:12,566
Signal for Captain Shepard.

1639
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,067
I'll take it.

1640
01:26:14,134 --> 01:26:15,567
It's from <i>King George V.</i>

1641
01:26:15,635 --> 01:26:17,068
[Richards] What is it?

1642
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,571
They've sighted <i>Bismarck</i>, sir.

1643
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,073
Oh! Here comes the main event.

1644
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,574
Urgent signal for you, sir.

1645
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,241
Right gun load.

1646
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,885
Right gun second half charge.

1647
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:39,514
Right gun loading.

1648
01:26:48,563 --> 01:26:51,498
How much fuel have we got left?

1649
01:26:51,565 --> 01:26:55,023
We shall have to
break off action in two hours, sir.

1650
01:26:57,604 --> 01:26:59,037
Main armament ready.

1651
01:26:59,105 --> 01:27:01,164
Enemy speed 10 knots.

1652
01:27:01,241 --> 01:27:03,766
Course 3-5-0, sir.

1653
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,214
They outnumber us 2 to 1...

1654
01:27:12,282 --> 01:27:15,217
and we can't do more than 10 knots.

1655
01:27:15,285 --> 01:27:17,219
What are you saying, Captain?

1656
01:27:17,285 --> 01:27:19,549
This is the <i>Bismarck.</i>

1657
01:27:19,622 --> 01:27:22,056
We still have all our guns...

1658
01:27:22,124 --> 01:27:24,592
and any moment now
the <i>Luftwaffe</i> will arrive.

1659
01:27:32,131 --> 01:27:34,156
[Speaking German]

1660
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:47,199
Open fire, Captain.

1661
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:48,539
Open fire.

1662
01:27:48,612 --> 01:27:49,772
Fire!

1663
01:27:58,619 --> 01:27:59,847
Open fire!

1664
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:01,513
Shoot!

1665
01:28:03,758 --> 01:28:05,623
Fire!

1666
01:28:07,626 --> 01:28:08,991
Shoot!

1667
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:14,563
She's hit.

1668
01:28:14,632 --> 01:28:15,963
Good shooting, Captain.

1669
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,332
Shoot!

1670
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:27,704
[Speaking German]

1671
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:35,607
Shoot!

1672
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,491
[Speaking German]

1673
01:29:00,237 --> 01:29:02,432
Shoot!

1674
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,049
[Speaking German]

1675
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:29,490
Aah!

1676
01:29:47,608 --> 01:29:49,542
Signal from <i>King George V</i>, sir.

1677
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:51,043
"<i>Bismarck</i> on fire amidships.

1678
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:53,545
Two of her turrets out of action."

1679
01:29:53,613 --> 01:29:55,171
All right.

1680
01:29:57,117 --> 01:30:00,575
I thought I'd be
cheering, sir, at this point...

1681
01:30:00,618 --> 01:30:02,552
but I'm afraid I can't.

1682
01:30:02,621 --> 01:30:05,488
I know. It's always that way.

1683
01:30:05,556 --> 01:30:07,615
Shoot!

1684
01:30:12,529 --> 01:30:14,963
[Speaking German]

1685
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,961
Hoffman, we have to flood
the forward magazines.

1686
01:30:22,036 --> 01:30:23,469
Get the men out.

1687
01:30:23,538 --> 01:30:25,472
They can't, sir.
They're trapped by the fire.

1688
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,974
There's too much
danger of blowing up. Flood them!

1689
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:29,474
What about the men?

1690
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:30,975
I gave an order, Hoffman!

1691
01:30:31,044 --> 01:30:32,477
Flood the forward magazines!

1692
01:30:32,545 --> 01:30:33,807
[Explosion]

1693
01:30:33,879 --> 01:30:37,076
Flood the forward magazines.

1694
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,468
Our fuel state is critical, sir.

1695
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:03,469
Get closer. Get closer.

1696
01:31:03,502 --> 01:31:05,436
We've got to finish her now!

1697
01:31:05,505 --> 01:31:07,200
Shoot!

1698
01:31:15,547 --> 01:31:17,981
All the guns out of action...

1699
01:31:18,048 --> 01:31:19,481
except "A" turret, sir.

1700
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:21,984
Where is your <i>Luftwaffe</i> now, sir?

1701
01:31:22,052 --> 01:31:23,485
I don't understand it.

1702
01:31:23,552 --> 01:31:24,985
The fuehrer promised...

1703
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:26,487
promised to send help.

1704
01:31:26,556 --> 01:31:28,490
[Explosion]

1705
01:31:28,558 --> 01:31:30,992
They will be along any minute now.

1706
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:32,491
You will see.

1707
01:31:49,508 --> 01:31:51,442
He was proud of that.

1708
01:31:57,415 --> 01:31:59,440
"Tomorrow the world."

1709
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,449
He said that only yesterday.

1710
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:03,451
He was right.

1711
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,681
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

1712
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,467
Sir, all the officers
on the bridge are dead.

1713
01:32:20,532 --> 01:32:23,968
I have to tell them
that all the guns are finished!

1714
01:32:26,537 --> 01:32:29,472
Finished? Tell the men to abandon ship!

1715
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:30,973
Abandon ship!

1716
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:32,634
Abandon ship!

1717
01:32:50,457 --> 01:32:54,450
We've got her! She's finished!

1718
01:32:54,526 --> 01:32:56,960
The <i>Dorsetshire</i> has joined us, sir.

1719
01:32:57,029 --> 01:32:59,361
Tell <i>Dorsetshire</i>
finish her off with torpedoes.

1720
01:32:59,432 --> 01:33:00,865
Aye aye, sir.

1721
01:33:00,933 --> 01:33:02,457
Cease firing!

1722
01:33:58,511 --> 01:34:00,502
She's going. Yeoman?

1723
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:02,014
Sir?

1724
01:34:02,082 --> 01:34:05,051
Tell <i>Dorsetshire</i>
to stand by to pick up survivors.

1725
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:06,516
Aye aye, sir.

1726
01:35:02,597 --> 01:35:04,030
Jenkins?

1727
01:35:04,099 --> 01:35:05,532
Sir?

1728
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,033
Make to admiralty... <i>Bismarck</i> is sunk.

1729
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:08,535
Fleet is returning to Scapa Flow.

1730
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,535
Aye aye, sir.

1731
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:17,541
Well, gentlemen...

1732
01:35:17,609 --> 01:35:19,304
let's go home.

1733
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,553
Shepard?

1734
01:35:32,622 --> 01:35:34,055
Sir?

1735
01:35:34,124 --> 01:35:37,560
The prime minister wants to see us
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

1736
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:39,559
I assume you can make yourself
available.

1737
01:35:39,627 --> 01:35:40,992
Certainly, sir.

1738
01:35:41,062 --> 01:35:42,996
Why should he want to see me?

1739
01:35:43,065 --> 01:35:46,501
Seems to think you had something
to do with this operation.

1740
01:35:46,567 --> 01:35:48,000
Thank you, sir.

1741
01:35:48,068 --> 01:35:49,501
Well done,Jonathan.

1742
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:51,003
Thank you, sir.

1743
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:52,502
Petty Officer Williams?

1744
01:35:52,572 --> 01:35:55,006
Take a message for
Telegraphist Brown in sick bay.

1745
01:35:55,074 --> 01:35:56,507
Tell him the <i>Bismarck's</i> been sunk.

1746
01:35:56,576 --> 01:35:58,009
Aye aye, sir.

1747
01:35:58,075 --> 01:36:00,509
May I offer my congratulations, too,
sir?

1748
01:36:00,578 --> 01:36:02,011
Thank you.

1749
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,013
Uh, take a message.

1750
01:36:04,082 --> 01:36:06,516
Request pleasure of the company...

1751
01:36:06,616 --> 01:36:08,049
Second Officer Anne Davis...

1752
01:36:08,117 --> 01:36:09,550
at dinner.

1753
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,553
Accepted.

1754
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:15,055
Good. I know you must be very tired...

1755
01:36:15,123 --> 01:36:16,556
and it's nearly 9:00...

1756
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,058
but how about tonight?

1757
01:36:18,126 --> 01:36:19,559
Right now.

1758
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:20,854
I'll get my things.

1759
01:36:39,143 --> 01:36:41,509
Great heavens.
It's 9:00 in the morning...

1760
01:36:41,577 --> 01:36:44,011
and I asked you out to dinner.

1761
01:36:44,081 --> 01:36:47,050
We could always make it breakfast,
couldn't we?

1762
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:48,515
Why not?

1763
01:36:50,085 --> 01:36:52,019
You know, Harvey, these boys worry me.

1764
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:53,520
Four stripes on his arm...

1765
01:36:53,588 --> 01:36:56,079
he don't even know
what time of day it is.
