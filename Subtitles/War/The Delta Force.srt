[man] Move it! Sergeant,
get your men on there! Let's go!

5
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,451
Is that Peterson's helicopter?

6
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,329
He was in that damn chopper
that blew up.

7
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,919
McCoy! McCoy, get back here!

8
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,838
Where the hell are you goin'?
We're pullin' out.

Captain McCoy!

10
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,678
- Bobby, where's Pete?
- Still in the damn chopper.

11
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,723
The flames are too high.
We tried, but he can't be reached.

12
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,684
Captain, don't go in there!
The fuel bladders are about to blow!

Goddamn it, get out of here!
This goddamn thing's gonna blow!

Hang on.

Listen, Pete. When I raise up the Jeep,
move your leg.

27
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,448
Ready?

28
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,492

Lean on me.

Move, move. Get 'em up here.
Come on, move.

34

All right, take it up. Let's go.

35
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,527
Colonel, Scott and Pete
are still back there.

36
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,780
They're two men. I got a whole squadron
to think about. Come on. Get it up!

37
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,993
Hey, there they are.

38

Why in the hell
wouldn't they listen, Nick?

49
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,644
We told 'em it's too dangerous
to launch this operation at night.

50
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,771
They thought their plan was better.

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,191
I spent five years in Vietnam
watching them doing the planning...

52
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,359
...and us the dying.

53
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,653
Well...

54
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,240
...I'm resigning when I get back.

- Attention please, flight 22...
- I have a bad leg.

69
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,130
I thought you would like to know

70
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,800
we're celebrating
our silver wedding anniversary.

71
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,426
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov.

72
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,762
Don't congratulate us.
We'd have gotten divorced years ago,

73
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,806
but neither one of us
wanted custody of our kids.

74
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,265
- Please don't listen to him.
- [laughter]

75
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,518
If it was up to him,
he would spoil 'em rotten.

76
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,812
- Know what? I'm going shopping.
- Good idea.

77
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,481
- I'm gonna see what my daughter's...
- You wanna go to the duty-free?

78
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,150
Let's go. Watch the things, honey.

79
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,571
- Harry Goldman. Philadelphia.
- Ben Kaplan. New York.

80
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,626
Deborah, let her have
the doll she wants. She's a baby.

81
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,962
Mama, she's not a baby,
and you're spoiling her.

82
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,173
I'm not spoiling her.
I didn't do such a bad job with you.

83
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,843
You know, Harry wanted to buy me
a new ring for our anniversary.

84
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,844
I said no.

85
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,055
He got me this ring in Jerusalem
on our honeymoon.

86
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,766
Really? Oh, it's lovely.
What does it say?

87
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,019
One minute. I'll show you.
Here, take it.

88
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,189
It says... [speaks Hebrew]

89
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,111
Ah, that's... That's Hebrew.
I know that.

90
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,196
It's from the Song of Songs.

91
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,241
"Me to my lover, my lover to me. "

92
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,951
You're Jewish, huh?

93
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,829
No, I'm Chinese. Of course.

94
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,453
What's the problem?

95
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,748
There's no problem, miss.
We thought you had a water leak.

We're full, sir. Please move aside.

105

You see in your book.
Maybe there is space.

Sir, you can't go on board this flight.

- Could you pull this for me?
- Yes.

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,890
- Could I have a glass of water, please?
- Sure.

133
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,558
She's afraid of flying.

to get there.

I am from Chicago myself.

I must have seen you
somewhere in Chicago.

141
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,995
You don't sound like Chicago.

142
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,122
Actually, I've only been
in Chicago four years.

143
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,458
- You're Polish?
- Russian.

00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,725
- Open...
- Calm down. We'll cooperate, man.

174
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,522
- We'll do anything you want.
- Open the cockpit. Open the cockpit.

175
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,398
Open this door.

176
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,114
Jim, it's me. Open.

177
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,703
Open, Jim.

178
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,539
[Jim] Is everything OK?

179
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,584
Everything is all right. Open, please.

180
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,970
Open this door or I will blow the plane!

181
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,685
Jim, you have to open!

182
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,990
Pick it up.

183
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,341
Move. Sit down.

184
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,554
I am taking over this airplane.
You will cooperate.

185
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,474
We'll take you anywhere
you wanna go, buddy.

186
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,811
Now, why don't you put that pin
back into that hand grenade?

187
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,480
Put it.

188
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,320
Easy, Jim.

189
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,163
I am prepared to die. I am Abdul Rafai.

190
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,458
I am a commander
in the New World Revolution.

191
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,461
You will take orders from me
and from no one but me,

192
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,214
or I will blow this airplane.
Do you hear me?

193
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,633
Loud and clear.

194
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,384
Now, you fly to Beirut.

195
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,012
- Where?
- Beirut. Fly to Beirut.

196
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,514
Beirut.

197
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,058
Roger.

198
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,978
What are you doing?
Take your hand away.

199
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,396
That's normal operating procedure.

200
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,106
[speaking foreign language]

201
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,903
Dave, contact Athens
departure control.

202
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,613
No!

203
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:53,368
You will fly by map.
I know flying. You will fly by map.

204
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,453
I don't think
we have enough fuel, Captain.

205
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,083
Then you will fly
until your fuel runs out, Captain.

206
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,793
That is all.

207
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,092
[man over radio] American Embassy?
This is the Athens airport tower.

208
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,052
Get me the communications officer.
It's urgent.

209
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,721
[man 2] This is the deputy chief officer
of the American Embassy in Athens.

210
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,515
Get me
the State Department Operations Center.

211
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,809
This is an emergency.
We need immediate access.

212
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,435
[man 3] I'm reporting a hijack.

213
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:24,899
The incident occurred five minutes ago
aboard American Travelways flight 282,

214
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,193
en route from Athens
via Rome to New York.

215
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,697
We have no more information at present
as to the status of the situation.

216
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,907
[man 4] This is the Secretary of State.

217
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,993
I have a priority flash
for the president.

218
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,578
[man 5] Yes, Mr. Secretary.
I'll put the president on the line.

219
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:51,467
Good evening.
Or, rather, good morning.

220
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,013
As you know, we have
a major crisis in the Middle East.

221
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,264
The president has decided

222
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,891
to send the Delta Force
into the area immediately.

223
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,771
Now, what we have to do is work out
an emergency rescue operation.

224
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,526
Get me Nick Alexander at Bragg.

225
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,655
Has anybody ever told you
you've got beautiful legs?

226
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,076
Ah, come on, Nick.
You can't see 'em from over there.

227
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:22,623
Well, I got a good imagination.
I, uh, was just tryin' to be nice.

228
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,710
Anyone ever accuse you
of being a gentleman, Nick?

229
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,796
- Not lately.
- [pager beeps]

230
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,007
Grab me the phone,
would you, sweetheart?

231
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,141
Alexander here.

232
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,813
Put Delta Force on a phase three alert.
ATW Flight 282 was just hijacked.

233
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,815
Get Saber Squadron
and fly to the Middle East.

234
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,359
- Lebanon?
- We don't know for sure.

235
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,611
Check in while you're in the air.

236
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,946
Will do, General.

237
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,740
Here you go, sweetheart.

238
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,664
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your new captain speaking.

239
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,750
My name is Abdul Rafai.

240
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,253
I am a member of the New World
Revolutionary Organization.

241
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,964
We have declared war
against the American imperialists,

242
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,302
Zionists, terrorists,
and all other antisocialist atrocities.

243
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,680
Your plane is now headed
for a new destination.

244
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,267
For your safety,
I suggest you listen carefully

245
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,436
and you follow all instructions.

246
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,525
- Harry.
- What?

247
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,443
Harry, my ring. It's Hebrew.

248
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,363
Take it off. Put it in your purse.

249
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,532
Take it off.

250
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,952
Harry, there's a white mark on my hand.
You think they're gonna notice?

251
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,169
- Will you marry me?
- [laughs]

252
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,965
Oh, Harry.
What's gonna happen to us?

253
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,008
One thing is certain.

254
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,554
We'll always remember
our silver wedding anniversary.

255
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,890
[man] Let's do something.

256
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,892
Yeah, it's only two of 'em.
We can take 'em.

257
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,021
Sh! That's not a good idea.
These guys are dangerous.

258
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,731
Now, they're gonna blow this plane up.

259
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,318
There's a lot of people on this plane,
and we just gotta play their game.

260
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,695
All right.

261
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,947
You can all sit up now!

262
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,784
But nobody talks!
Nobody move!

263
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,956
[man] Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

264
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,083
- This young lady is preg...
- Shut up!

265
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,669
Please, I'm not feeling well.

266
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,426
An unidentified source
at the State Department

267
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,262
has just confirmed
that an American airliner

268
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,848
en route from Athens
to Rome and New York

269
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,266
has just been hijacked.

270
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,811
Over 100 Americans are believed
to be on board the ATW airliner.

271
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,522
We'll bring you further developments
as they occur.

272
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,609
In the meantime, none of the known
terrorist groups in that region

273
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,446
are willing to take responsibility
for this current action.

274
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,951
Now!

275
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,622
All men sit by the windows.

276
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,626
All women sit near the aisles!
Do it now and quickly!

277
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,961
Just do it!

278
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,134
Fast! Fast! And quiet!

279
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,390
[man] You shut up. Nobody talk.

280
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,979
[woman on TV] The hijacked plane
is still in the air

281
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,148
heading for an
unknown destination,

282
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,484
presumably somewhere
in the Middle East.

283
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,818
There is still no word

284
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,489
on the condition of the Americans
and the other hostages on board.

285
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,782
We'll keep you updated

286
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,993
as further information
becomes available.

287
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,374
Everyone get up
and go into the back. Hurry up!

288
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,833
Hurry up!

289
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,128
We're coming. We're coming.
It's all right.

290
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,338
Move! Move!

291
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,801
- Excuse me. I left my purse.
- Leave it! Go!

292
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,098
[man] Come on back. Keep movin'.
Move. Come on, move.

293
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,017
- Come on, move. Keep movin'.
- Sit down!

294
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,228
- I can't sit on the floor.
- Sit!

295
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,646
My back.

296
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,857
Sit! Sit up there. Sit there. Sit.

297
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,111
- I'll sit on his lap.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

298
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,362
Sit down!

299
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,739
- Watch that gun, sir. It might go off.
- [screaming]

300
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,367
- What'd you hit him for, man?
- Sit!

301
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,414
Keep quiet. Silence.

302
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,207
There's no space to breathe here.

303
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,793
Shut up! Everyone, shut up!

304
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,420
Sit down!

305
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,630
[Deborah] Ellen! Come back here!

306
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,382
What are you doing here? Go back.

307
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,717
My doll.

308
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,600
It's a nice doll. What is your name?

309
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,852
Ellen.

310
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,062
Ellen. It's a very nice name.

311
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,815
How old are you, Ellen?

312
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,650
Six.

313
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,278
You know, Ellen,

314
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,907
I had a daughter exactly your age.
Her name was Salima.

315
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,326
You understand, Ellen?

316
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,163
Good. Take it.

317
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,956
Thank you.

318
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,292
Go, go. Go!

319
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,544
Come on.

320
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,105
Hey, Ace. You think
the captain's gonna show up?

321
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,440
I'll be damned if he doesn't.

322
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,108
Well, wasn't he called?

323
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,112
Well, who'd call him? He's retired
to that old horse farm of his.

324
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,990
Though, I must admit I wouldn't mind
havin' Captain McCoy along.

325
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,117
I, uh, took the liberty
of giving him a call, sir.

326
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,535
You what?

327
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,995
Well, he wasn't at home.

328
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,664
Then he just might be
on his way here, Colonel.

329
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,958
Nah. None of that.

330
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,127
Now, that looks good.

331
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,588
Oh, yeah.

332
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,800
Pull down the shades.
Pull down the shades.

333
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,303
Put the shades down.
All of you! Shades down.

334
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,098
Pull them down!

335
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,895
All right. Pull them down.
All these window shades, pull them down.

336
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,314
Pull the shades down. Come on.
Pull the shades.

337
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,293
Pull these down.

338
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,920
[speaking foreign language]

339
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,814
Come here. Come here!

340
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:12,283
There are Israelis aboard this airplane.
I want you to identify them for me.

341
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,411
We don't know who the Israelis are.
How could we?

342
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,206
They came off the El Al flight,
and I will find them.

343
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,086
Collect all passports.

344
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,380
- Why?
- Do it!

345
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,674
OK.

346
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,557
Ladies and gentlemen, attention please.

347
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,851
They want all of you to turn
in your passports.

348
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,230
So, please, get out your passports
and hold them over your head.

349
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,649
- Why?
- I don't know why.

350
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,236
[woman] Thank you.

351
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,909
Come on.

352
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,705
[speaking foreign language]

353
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,561
Just be quiet
and do what they tell you to do.

354
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,940
No, just women!
You go back. Go back! Back!

355
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,858
[woman] Miss, did they tell you
why they want our passports?

356
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:28,859
Do you know why?

357
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,779
[woman 2] Will we get them back?
We need our passports.

358
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,892
Put them here. Here.
All of them. I want all of them.

359
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,479
No cheating. I know
there are 144 passengers.

360
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,022
Ingrid is getting the rest.

361
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,983
Excuse me, miss? Miss?

362
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,901
Miss, we don't have passports.
We're in the Navy.

363
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,195
- We have these green Navy IDs.
- Hide them away.

364
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,489
Hide it, man. Put it away.

365
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,618
Hey, you. Why didn't you
collect these men's passports?

366
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,329
- They don't have passports.
- It's impossible. You are Iying.

367
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,040
No, wait a second. We have these.
We have these.

368
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,626
- What is this?
- It's a Navy ID.

369
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,088
- Marines.
- No, Navy.

370
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,631
We're divers for the American Navy.

371
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,676
- You?
- All three of us. We're all Navy.

372
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,637
Marines. American Marines.

373
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,640
American Marines killed many
of my friends when they bombed Beirut.

374
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,392
America never bombed Beirut.

375
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,395
American planes from your ship
New Jersey bombed our camps.

376
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,356
- Relax.
- Son, you're making a mistake.

377
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,525
America never bombed Beirut.

378
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,902
- Your American ship!
- No!

379
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,738
- [yelling]
- No!

380
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,990
[all yelling]

381
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,744
Stop! He's a priest!

382
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,123
[speaking foreign language]

383
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,553
Oh, yes? Three American heroes.

384
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,390
From now on, you travel
only first class, gentlemen.

385
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,396
What's goin' on here?

386
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,106
Shut up.

387
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,317
- Why do you want us...
- Just shut up!

388
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,199
Come here.

389
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,493
Hold this.

390
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:06,809
Please, just be quiet. OK?

391
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,311
Everything will be all right.

392
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,151
Listen. You don't have to do that.

393
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,196
- We'll cooperate.
- Shut up. Sit down.

394
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,865
Sit down.

395
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:26,036
Now, you listen to me.
Look at this passport one by one.

396
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,581
Pick out the passport with Jewish names.

397
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,084
American passports
do not state religion.

398
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,504
Give me the Israelis.

399
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,381
There are no Israelis onboard.

400
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,884
Then pick out the Jewish names.

401
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,888
I told you, there is no way
I can know who is a Jew. How can I?

402
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,973
Do it!

403
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,435
I can't! I won't do it!

404
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,061
Yes, you will do it!

405
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,982
No, not me!
Don't you see? I'm German!

406
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,569
What does that mean?

407
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,364
The selections. The Nazis.

408
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:07,453
The death camps! Don't you see
I can't do what you want me to do?

409
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,502
Very sorry, dear lady.

410
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:20,632
But... you must do this for us.

411
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,392
You claim you belong
to a revolutionary organization.

412
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,020
That is correct.
We are freedom fighters.

413
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,314
We are fighting for our brothers.

414
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,609
But then you don't want
to be associated with Nazis

415
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,402
who killed six million Jews.

416
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,197
Not enough, lady. Not enough.

417
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,491
The Jews stole Palestine.
They took our lands.

418
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,035
Leave her alone! Without that gun,
you wouldn't be shit!

419
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,579
- Shut up, you American imperialist pig!
- Stop it, please!

420
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,165
- You are all pigs and killers.
- Don't let him kill him!

421
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,291
[grunts]

422
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,419
- Don't let him kill him, please.
- [shouting, grunting]

423
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,963
- Stop him! Don't let him kill him!
- Bitch!

424
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,465
- [Mustafa] Pig!
- [Ingrid] Please!

425
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,301
You will do what Abdul said.

426
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,346
He is your new captain,
and you obey or you die.

427
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,389
You hear me? You die.

428
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,852
We will kill everyone
on this bloody plane.

429
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,648
No, I won't do it!

430
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,108
Yes!

431
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,739
What's going on, Colonel?

432
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,075
Men and equipment are aboard.
What's the delay?

433
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,326
I'll give him five more minutes.

434
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,203
- Who?
- Oh, nothing, sir.

435
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,580
Just a few more minutes.

436
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,460
Colonel?

437
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,225
Well, it's about time you showed up.

438
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,727
I was afraid
I was gonna have to use this.

439
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,728
What is it?

440
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,440
A presidential decree
ordering you back to duty.

441
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,652
And you can leave the keys
in the van, too.

442
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,030
I've got your gear on the plane.
General, we're all set.

443
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,031
Good luck, Colonel.

444
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,076
- How was your engagement party?
- Well, it was a little cut short.

445
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,579
- Bobby, good to see you.
- Welcome back, boss.

446
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,998
- Do you know who that guy is?
- No.

447
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,835
- Well, let's go do it.
- Let's do it.

448
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,171
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you, Captain Jack.

449
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,302
Remember, I don't want
to carry your ass this time.

450
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,804
- No way, Captain.
- Major.

451
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,640
Yes, sir, Major.

452
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,142
Major.

453
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,478
- What the hell, huh?
- [laughter]

454
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,688
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

455
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,973
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your new captain speaking.

456
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,559
Miss Ingrid will read some names.

457
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,311
- If your name is called...
- What are they doing?

458
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,521
...come immediately
to first class cabin.

459
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,733
I repeat, immediately.

460
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:37,621
Kaplan, Benjamin.
Mr. Benjamin Kaplan.

461
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,083
This can't be happening.
Not now, not again.

462
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,334
Not again.

463
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,713
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Don't go.

464
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,258
We... We survived once.

465
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,386
We can do it again.

466
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,017
I'm coming.

467
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,233
Where are you going?
Go back to your seat.

468
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,693
He is my husband.

469
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,277
Sit down!

470
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,947
No. No. I won't listen.

471
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:16,034
No, I won't. Go on! Listen!
Why don't you all do something?

472
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:20,080
There's only two of them!
There's so many of you! Why don't you?

473
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,249
I don't care.

474
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,167
[woman] She's just upset.

475
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,211
No, it's the war!

476
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,505
It's the war all over again!
The concentration camps!

477
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,924
Why don't you do something? Something!

478
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,051
- There's only two of them!
- [Mustafa] Sit down!

479
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,886
And there's so many of us!

480
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,014
- Do something!
- Please...

481
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,441
You! Sit down! Sit!

482
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,871
I'm Benjamin Kaplan.

483
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,833
What can I do for you?

484
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,128
Sit down.

485
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,964
Next one.

486
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,011
Harry Goldman.

487
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,304
[woman sobs]

488
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,598
[Ingrid] Mr. Harry Goldman,
come to first class, please.

489
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,850
Please. Don't take him, please.

490
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,643
He's a sick man.
He has a heart condition.

491
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,937
- Sylvia. Sylvia, be strong.
- Please no!

492
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,981
Listen to me. Be strong. I'm OK.

493
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,110
- Please don't go!
- I can go. I can go. It's OK.

494
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,820
- It's OK.
- [Mustafa] Move.

495
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,657
- [sobbing]
- It's OK.

496
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,827
[mouthing]

497
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,581
[Mustafa] Go!

498
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,172
- Harry Goldman.
- Sit.

499
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,633
Next.

500
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,635
Robert Levine.

501
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,847
Mr. Robert Levine,
please come to first class, please.

502
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,019
OK, OK. Move, move. Move.

503
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,815
[sobbing] Please don't take my daddy.

504
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,486
Daddy, take me with you!

505
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,406
I have to go, sweetheart.
But I'm not leaving the plane.

506
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,034
- He can't, sweetie. Daddy can't...
- I'm not leaving the plane.

507
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,661
I'll be back.

508
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,373
Daddy. Here, take.

509
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,011
OK, move! Move, move!

510
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,514
Move, move!

511
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,809
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move!

512
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,062
You just keep your hands
off my daughter.

513
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,897
Move.

514
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,903
On the floor.

515
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,123
David Rosovsky.

516
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,128
Mr. Rosovsky,
come to first class, please.

517
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,260
They're making a mistake.
They're making a mistake.

518
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,428
[stammering]

519
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,015
Mr. Rosovsky, you move
or I shoot you right here.

520
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,100
But I am not Jewish. I'm an American.

521
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,102
I came from Russia,
but now I live in America.

522
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,900
I am Christian Orthodox. Ask them.
Sister, tell him I am not a Jew.

523
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,903
Father, don't you know me from Chicago?

524
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,780
- Move!
- [Sister] Wait.

525
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,365
Wait. This man is telling the truth.

526
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,117
- He's telling the truth.
- Sit down. We know what we are doing.

527
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:47,287
Sir, you are making a big mistake...

528
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,707
Sit down. On the floor!

529
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,210
[shouting continues]

530
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,841
- He is telling the truth.
- Sit down. We know what we are doing.

531
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,468
Father, where are you going?

532
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,886
You, come back!

533
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,180
Come back! I said come back!

534
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,431
No!

535
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,851
Sit down!

536
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,487
- What are you doing here?
- You called me.

537
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,448
- What is your name?
- William O'Malley.

538
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,326
- I did not call you.
- You called for all the Jews.

539
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,995
I'm Jewish, just like Jesus Christ.

540
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,999
You take one of us,
you gotta take us all.

541
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,340
Sit down, then.

542
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,561
- You.
- Me?

543
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,647
Yeah. The pregnant lady. Come on.

544
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,774
Excuse me.

545
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:02,570
You, go, go, go. Move. Come, come.

546
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,324
I need some pillows.
Give me some pillows.

547
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,701
Come, come, come.

548
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,497
Yeah... Sit down. Sit.

549
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,626
OK, that's enough. Sit.
That's enough. Sit down.

550
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,421
- You feel good? Yes?
- Fine. Thank you for remembering.

551
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,882
- OK everything? Yeah? Good.
- Thank you.

552
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,764
[inaudible chatter]

553
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,357
- Sleep well.
- Thanks.

554
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,751
[Roger] Beirut approach control,
American Travelways flight 282,

555
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:01,921
under command of Captain Abdul Rafai

556
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,466
of the New...

557
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,009
World Revolution.

558
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,347
...World Revolution
requesting landing instructions.

559
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,726
American Travelway, I am unable
to give you landing instruction.

560
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,938
This airport is closed today
to all international flights

561
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,191
by order of the Lebanese government.

562
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,611
You heard the man.
Now what do you want to do?

563
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,155
Land.

564
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,574
Damn.

565
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,243
[engine roaring]

566
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,919
[horn honks]

567
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,799
Beirut, you must clear that runway
at once, or we'll all die.

568
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,718
You are facing disaster
if you try to land.

569
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,554
[engine roaring]

570
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,814
Just a minute.

571
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,233
[speaking foreign language]

572
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,533
Captain? Captain, this is
the Minister of Defense speaking.

573
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,618
You cannot land in our country.

574
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,370
We have enough trouble
without you people.

575
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:19,624
We have 144 men, women, and children
aboard this aircraft.

576
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,835
The hijacker has threatened
to blow us up.

577
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:25,547
But if he does,
it'll be your responsibility.

578
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:30,009
Do you understand that, Mr. Minister?
Do we now have your permission to land?

579
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,179
My answer is definitely not.

580
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,960
- [grunting]
- [people groaning]

581
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,217
[speaking foreign language]

582
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,555
[grunting over radio]

583
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,434
- [sobbing]
- [grunting continues]

584
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,229
Captain, what's this shouting?
What's going on there?

585
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:28,401
They're torturing a young boy.
A Navy hostage.

586
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,403
They're killing him.

587
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,865
Mr. Minister,
we're coming in for landing

588
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,076
whether we have your permission or not.

589
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,244
Reducing power.

590
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,541
[speaking foreign language]

591
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,754
Captain, it's OK.
You have permission to land.

592
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,257
But just give me a minute.
I want to clear the runway.

593
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,957
[Nick] All right, gentlemen.

594
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,210
We'll go in three sections.
McCoy, you'll lead the first section.

595
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,673
I want you to hit the emergency exits
on the port wing, here and here,

596
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,301
clearing the first-class cabin
and the cockpit.

597
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,305
Pete, you'll have the second section.
I want you to hit the emergency exits

598
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,059
on the starboard wing, here,
clearing the main cabin.

599
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,271
Bobby, you'll have section three
for backup and emergencies.

600
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,608
Move fast. It should be a piece of cake.
There are only two terrorists onboard.

601
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,901
How do we know that?

602
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,862
A calculated guess.

603
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,615
All right, gentlemen. Any questions?

604
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,125
Please help yourself.

605
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,636
[speaking foreign language]

606
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,128
Mama, it's so hot.

607
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,089
I know, sweetie. Everybody's hot.

608
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,716
What are they doing there with Daddy?

609
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,636
[sighs] Asking him some questions.

610
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,930
What kind of questions?

611
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,934
Maybe, uh... about being Jewish.

612
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,646
They don't like Jews, huh, Mama?

613
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,606
No, sweetie, they don't like Jews.

614
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,442
Open the door. Open the door. Open.

615
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,655
[speaking foreign language]

616
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,157
You move, move, move. Sit down.

617
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,793
[men shouting]

618
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,902
[all speaking indistinctly]

619
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,289
- Father, God be with you.
- Take care of yourself, Sister.

620
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,040
Take care of them.

621
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,670
You stay.

622
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,632
Ben.

623
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,010
Don't take him, please.

624
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,722
Daddy. Mommy, they're taking Daddy.

625
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,350
No!

626
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,355
Move, move.

627
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,281
All right, time to leave. We take off.

628
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,282
Where to?

629
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,451
I will let you know
when we reach the sky.

630
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,557
[speaking foreign language]

631
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,105
[church bell rings]

632
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,841
[speaking foreign language]

633
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,458
[chanting in foreign language]

634
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,504
[man] We've been informed
by Israeli Intelligence

635
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,090
that they've left Beirut
and are headed towards North Africa.

636
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,092
We have reason to believe
they're on their way to Algiers.

637
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,970
If so, they'll be landing
at Boumediene Airport in four hours.

638
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,435
[man] Nick, I've just had confirmation
from the president.

639
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,481
The Algerian government is ready
to cooperate. You can go to Algiers.

640
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,693
[Scott] All right, guys. Listen up.

641
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:12,365
We're landing in Algiers.
Prepare your gear.

642
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,909
[all chattering]

643
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,791
Algiers, this is Delta One
requesting permission to land.

644
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,710
Delta One, this is
Boumediene International Airport.

645
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,045
Permission granted.

646
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:56,283
American Travelways flight 282,
this is Boumediene Algiers Airport.

647
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,910
You are cleared to land.

648
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,761
So you men stay with the equipment.

649
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,100
We are gonna go for it this time,
right, Colonel?

650
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,643
Damn right.

651
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,778
This is Delta One. I receive you.
Delta One, I receive you.

652
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,947
Yes, sir. Just a minute, sir.

653
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,784
Colonel. Colonel,
General Woodbridge, sir.

654
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,957
General Woodbridge, we've got
damn near perfect conditions now.

655
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,585
It's just the situation
we've been waiting for.

656
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,713
If we wait any longer,
we can end up with another fiasco.

657
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:55,843
I'm sorry, Nick. The president
doesn't want to risk any lives.

658
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,554
If he can release our people
through negotiations,

659
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,638
that's what he wants to do.

660
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,934
So until the negotiations break down...

661
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,979
...your people are on hold.

662
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,651
How long do we have to wait?

663
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,529
Well, General Woodbridge is waiting
for the go-ahead from the president.

664
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,823
I'm waiting for the go-ahead
from General Woodbridge,

665
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,576
and you're waiting
for the go-ahead from me, clear?

666
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,787
In the meantime,
I'm going over to the terminal.

667
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,081
I wanna debrief any hostages
that are released,

668
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,166
if and when any are released.

669
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,169
So you get out there. And get set.

670
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,963
- But wait for my signal.
- Got it.

671
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,098
OK, get rid of the box.

672
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,569
Move out.

673
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,045
Captain Rafai,
the flight from Athens has just landed.

674
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,631
Your comrade will be
with you any moment.

675
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,552
We expect you to release the women
and children without any more delays.

676
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,764
[Abdul] We shall keep our word
as promised, Mr. Ambassador.

677
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,016
All right, Colonel,
I'm gonna go to the plane.

678
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,685
I'll wait for you here, Mr. Ambassador.

679
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,980
You send back any hostage
from that plane that speaks English.

680
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,612
McCoy, nobody moves until all
the women and children are safe.

681
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,574
All sections, acknowledge.
One, two and three.

682
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,215
[speaking foreign language]

683
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,687
[speaking foreign language]

684
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,939
You wait. You get women and children.

685
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,080
Please, let him go.

686
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,166
He's almost dead.

687
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,334
No.

688
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,838
But you may go.
I release you with the women.

689
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Go.

690
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,515
Ingrid...

691
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,436
You're a brave woman.

692
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,282
Section one in position.

693
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,075
Section two in position.

694
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,077
Section three in position.

695
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,122
We don't move until the women
and children are away and safe.

696
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,000
- Acknowledge, section two.
- Section two acknowledge.

697
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,334
Section three?

698
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,295
Section three acknowledge.

699
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,215
Ladies and children, Allah be praised.

700
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:07,553
It is time to leave the airplane.
Men will stay in their seats.

701
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,890
We will ask you to have your valuables,
your money, yourjewelry

702
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,352
out in your hands
so that we may collect them

703
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,980
when you come
through the first-class cabin.

704
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,525
Go on, sweetie. You go ahead.
Come on.

705
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,693
We'll see you later.

706
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,822
- [all clamoring]
- [speaking foreign language]

707
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,492
Jay, you take care of your mom.
You understand me?

708
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,541
You ladies, go forward.
Everyone forward.

709
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,711
- Leave it with you.
- Move forward, Christian ladies.

710
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,755
Why are you behaving
like common bandits?

711
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,089
You're freedom fighters,
aren't you?

712
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,090
Go.

713
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,260
Move.

714
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,139
Go. Go.

715
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,516
I take this... and this...

716
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,851
I have some money.

717
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,399
- This is yours?
- Yes.

718
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,575
Thank you.

719
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,454
- You have some money? OK, go.
- Here.

720
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,665
[indistinct chatter]

721
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,731
Go. Go.

722
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,949
Thank God the women are safe.

723
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,939
[beeping]

724
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,065
Yeah.

725
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,776
Nick, the bus has left.
We're ready to make our move.

726
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,737
Sorry, McCoy. We're still on hold.

727
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,782
Damn it, Nick.
Let's not screw this one up.

728
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,832
Everyone to the back!
To the back!

729
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,709
[all shouting]

730
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,672
- [man] Colonel Alexander?
- Yeah.

731
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,382
They want you on the phone.

732
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,387
Alexander here.

733
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,931
Nick, it's a go.

734
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,725
Gotcha.

735
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,647
McCoy, it's a go. Take 'em down.

736
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:11,236
OK, section two and three, let's do it.
Close communications.

737
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,199
We go in... 60 seconds.

738
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,284
Ready? Mark.

739
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,454
Mark. We go in 60 seconds.

740
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,331
Sixty seconds. Mark.

741
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,458
Radios off the air.

742
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,517
Colonel, this is Ingrid Harding,
she's the plane's purser.

743
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,561
Mr. Ambassador, excuse me.
I'd like to talk to her alone.

744
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,480
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

745
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,902
Miss Harding,
this will only take a few minutes.

746
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:52,945
What's happening?

747
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,155
The Algerian commandos
are gonna break into the plane.

748
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,574
Oh, no. Don't.

749
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,118
All the hostages in Beirut,
they'll kill them all.

750
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,286
What hostages?

751
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,248
The guys from the Navy
and all the Jews they took off the plane

752
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,958
when the other hijackers came on.

753
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,544
- What other hijackers?
- All those men who came on board.

754
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,337
Ten or 12 of them.

755
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,632
Oh, God. All sections, all sections.

756
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,926
OK, 30 seconds. All right?

757
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,763
All sections!
Come on, somebody respond.

758
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,808
Let's go. Turn the light on.
Hit the siren.

759
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,686
- All sections.
- [siren wailing]

760
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,150
[siren approaching]

761
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,614
What the hell is that?

762
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,158
Come on, get out of there, McCoy.

763
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,493
McCoy!

764
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,997
Turn the lights!
Turn the lights out!

765
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,791
[speaking foreign language]

766
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,377
- What the hell?
- [siren wailing]

767
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,843
Don't shoot back! We're clearing out!
Get out!

768
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,511
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

769
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,889
- [gunfire]
- Get out. Get out of the tanker.

770
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,705
Oh, shit.

771
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,835
Take off immediately! Take off!

772
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,588
- All right, all right.
- Take off!

773
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,563
[speaking foreign language]
Come. Come.

774
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:59,363
Americans, look what you have done!

775
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,366
Look here, Americans! Look!

776
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,533
He's gonna kill him.

777
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,370
Now your American president
will know we are serious!

778
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,413
- Here is a token for him...
- Don't shoot.

779
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,915
...and the American people.

780
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,626
- One Marine killer!
- [gunshot]

781
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,389
Oh, Jesus.

782
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,057
Son of a bitch. Let's go.

783
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,601
Come on, move.

784
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,303
Sorry I had to do it that way, boys.

785
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,639
It was the only way
I could stop you in time.

786
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,224
What happened, Colonel?

787
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,101
Twelve terrorists got on board.

788
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,146
They were in every corner of that plane
with machine guns.

789
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,856
It would've been a disaster.

790
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,567
He's an American. He was in the Navy.

791
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,694
Where do we go from here?

792
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,487
After them, I hope.

793
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,208
They're going back to Beirut.

794
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,169
You mean it's all over for us?

795
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,754
On the contrary, Colonel.

796
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,881
The president wants you
to fly to Israel.

797
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,758
Israel?

798
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,761
[man] Israel is America's best friend
in the Middle East,

799
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,345
and it's only 20 minutes from Beirut.

800
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,807
You're gonna get anything and everything
you want to do it right.

801
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,477
The president wants those people home.

802
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,396
So do we, General. So do we.

803
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,713
We are Americans. Stay down.

804
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,887
- Clear.
- Clear!

805
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:33,558
Not bad, McCoy. Not bad.
Twenty seconds. Just like clockwork.

806
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,852
- We can do it in ten.
- All right, one more time.

807
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,407
Hold it, McCoy. We got visitors.

808
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,578
- Colonel Alexander?
- Yeah.

809
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,456
Good morning. I'm Colonel Amir
from the Israeli Intelligence.

810
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,625
Oh, yes. How are you?
This is Major McCoy.

811
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,378
- Good morning, Major.
- Colonel.

812
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,214
- Can I talk to you?
- Well, certainly.

813
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,591
Bobby, take over.
I want it done in ten seconds.

814
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,802
- You got it, sir.
- We'll be right down.

815
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,470
[Nick] So, what's happening?

816
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,430
[Amir] They've taken the hostages
off the plane.

817
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,182
- [Nick] Where to?
- [Amir] I don't know.

818
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,892
They could be spreading them
all over Beirut by now.

819
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:16,893
[Scott] That's bad.

820
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:21,022
Colonel, I assume your Mossad still has
people planted in Lebanon, right?

821
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,899
Your assumption is correct.

822
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,569
I need to get in contact
with one of them.

823
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:29,656
You mean you want to get in
and do some reckoning before the rescue?

824
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:30,991
It'd be a great help to us, Colonel.

825
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,701
If I may suggest...

826
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,288
They've announced
an international press conference.

827
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,790
Of course. Now that they
got the world's attention,

828
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,585
they wanna manipulate
the press. Perfect.

829
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,391

834
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:50,338
I was in Beirut 20 years ago.
You should have been here then.

835
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:52,757
It was something.

836
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:59,139
They had everything:
nightclubs, dancing, concerts, laughter.

837
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,685
It was the Las Vegas of the Middle East.

838
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,148
Beirut was beautiful then. Beautiful.

839

840
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,656
Hey, Marine heroes.

841
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,327
Your friend.

842
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,207
He made the news.

843
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,099
They killed him. They killed Tom.

[reporters clamoring]

845
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,945
How have they been treating you,
Captain?

846
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:40,031
- Sh!
- Quite well.

847
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,659
They're feeding us.
They're letting us use the rest rooms.

848
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,411
I suppose, under the circumstances,
they're treating us quite well.

849
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:48,873
Where are the others?
Where do they keep the Jews?

850
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,542
It's true about the selection?

851
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:51,876
Go back!

One more question!

855
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,522
If you try to be clever with me,
Captain, I will kill you.

856
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,150
That'd make you a real hero,
wouldn't it?

857
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,985
Yes, yes.

858
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:21,406
Now, you go back to the press,
but you watch what you say, huh?

859
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:29,038
Now, ask your questions, please.

Where'd you get the stupid belt?

864
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,754
You gave it to me for my birthday.

865
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,798
I did? I hope you like it.

867
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:45,949
[priest] So you're Canadian.

868
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:49,619
You're blessed
with a beautiful and peaceful country.

869
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,621
I'd like to go there myself one day.

870
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,499
Well, it's a beautiful country here.
It's a shame.

871
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,708
Do you know where we need to go?

872
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,211
Yes, my son. We're on our way.

873
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,047
You'll need these.

874
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,699
If you look down to your right,
you'll see the main sewer pipe.

875
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,285
It will lead you directly
to the backyard of the school.

876
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,373
That is where most of the hostages are.

877
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:55,810
Their headquarters. The Jews are there.
Do you want to come with me?

878
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,979
No, go and do what you have to do.

879
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,233
Under the seat you'll find something
you might need... just in case.

880
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,818
Don't take too long.

881
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,088
Boss, aren't we trusting this guy
a bit too much?

882
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:27,842
The Israelis say
he's the best man they have in Lebanon.

883
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,803
And we need someone
to get the message back to Nick.

We'd better get outta here.

He started to say something.
Then we lost him.

Well, I can't wait any longer.

all the vehicles, weaponry, personal.

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,871
Let's go.

920
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,588
Aw, Jesus, boss. She's had it.
We need another vehicle here.

We've got one.

Well, we have three targets.

of Beirut beach. 60 hostages are there.

931

Do you know where that is?

932
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:19,855
Is it the one
by the Greek Orthodox cemetery?

933
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:21,065
- Yeah, right.
- I got it.

934
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,526
And the Jews are being held
in a dungeon at their headquarters.

935
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:25,569
It's in the center of town.
You know where it's at, right?

936
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:26,695
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

937
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:28,864
And the ATW crew
is still being held on the plane.

938
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,366
We'll have to get them last.

939

Right. And I drew a map here.

I will drive a truck,

952
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,094
and truck, it will blow.

953
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,722
That'll be suicide. You know that.

954
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:41,974
I know how to die.

955
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:45,269
The White House is a very big place.
You'll need a lot of explosives.

956
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,439
You'll never get near the place.

Drop that thing and get down here quick.

Don't worry. You'll be jogging
by next week. Let's go.

01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:52,560
Let me carry him. You've enough to do.

Thank you. Gentlemen,
follow me quickly.

1009
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,732
Better hurry. I think there's
heavy reinforcements are on the way.

- How do you know?
- Something I heard on the radio.

1011
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,320
I didn't know you spoke Arabic.

1012
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:04,739
If we don't get outta here,
we'll all be speaking it.

01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:06,449
Bobby! Come on.

1014
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:12,330
- Watch his leg.
- Let's just go. Come on.

1015
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:20,463
[Nick] Come on, keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Let's go.

1016
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,716
Come on, men, we gotta go.
Let's go, come on.

1017
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:29,389
[man] Hit it. Move it, move it. Go!

1018
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:54,080
Goddamn place is empty.

1019
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,717
Looks like they've been here.

1020
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:16,144
- Come on. Let's go.
- [beeping]

1021
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:20,899
- Delta One.
- Delta Two here.

1022
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:23,026
Colonel, by the looks of it,
their headquarters is empty.

1023
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:25,779
The cells are,
I repeat, the cells are empty.

1024
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,198
Looks like they've taken
our people away.

1025
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:29,699
Then find 'em, damn it.

1026
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,910
Any suggestions, Delta One?

1027
01:36:32,077 --> 01:36:34,704
Beggin' the Colonel's pardon,
but Beirut's a goddamn big city.

1028
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,122
There's over two million people here.

1029
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,248
You know what to do, Pete.

1030
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,292
Find one that speaks English
and work on him.

1031
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,835
Come on, boys! You gotta move fast!

1032
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:43,296
Gotta find one who'll talk.

1033
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:07,487
- Where'd you find 'em all?
- Hiding in the bedrooms upstairs.

1034
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:08,655
Yeah?

1035
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:15,537
Now, who is your commanding officer?

1036
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:17,789
Speak or you're dead.

1037
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,709
- Officer. You? You? Officer?
- [all shouting]

1038
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,089
Come here. Get up.

1039
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,678
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth. Mouth.

1040
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,429
Ah, ah!

1041
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:37,559
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Nod if you wanna live.

1042
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:40,353
Do you wanna live? Live?

1043
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,939
- Where did they take the Americans?
- Ah, ah...

1044
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:46,109
Where did they take the Americans?

1045
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:55,118
[speaking foreign language]

1046
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:11,885
First and ten, Delta One.
They're on their way to Teheran.

1047
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,887
They should be somewhere
on the Damascus road right now.

1048
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:18,141
- Go after them.
- Yes, sir. I'll see you when I see you.

1049
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:19,809
OK, let's move!

1050
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:32,488
Damn. It's gonna be light soon.

1051
01:38:32,656 --> 01:38:34,782
Take off, Nick.
I'll delay the reinforcements.

1052
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,201
OK. Then you join Pete.

1053
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:38,411
I'll see you at the airport.

1054
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:39,996
I won't be able to wait for you.

1055
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,915
- Then don't wait.
- I won't.

1056
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:43,583
OK, Bobby, you stick with the major.

1057
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,585
Then take my vehicle
and meet us back at the orchard.

1058
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,962
- Will do.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

1059
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:01,267
Delta Two, this is Delta One. Over.

1060
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:03,561
- What's the plan, boss?
- A surprise party.

1061
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:05,563
- Just like the old days.
- You got it.

1062
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:07,190
Delta Two, Delta One. Come in.

1063
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:08,942
I'm gonna prepare the upper floors.

1064
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:10,902
Yeah, I'm here, Major.

1065
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,195
[Scott] How's it goin', kid?

1066
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:16,491
Well, those bastards snaked us, boss.
[spits] I'm gonna go get 'em.

1067
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,701
[Scott] Watch your ass, Butch, OK?

1068
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:20,787
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you, boss.

1069
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:23,790
[cat meowing]

1070
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,584
- Bobby.
- Yo.

1071
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:29,420
- It's showtime.
- Let's rock 'n' roll.

1072
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:38,972

1073
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:08,042

[speaking foreign language]

1077
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,713
Goddamn. That's Scott down there.
All right, let's rock 'n' roll, partner.

1078
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:01,090
OK, let's move! Let's go!

1079
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:06,429
Let's take 'em.

1080
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:09,473
[shouting]

1081
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:15,188
They're our guys. They're Americans.
They're Delta Force.

1082
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:56,312
[grunting]

1083
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:08,950
Need a hand?

1084
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,577
Grab the wheel!

1085
01:44:41,024 --> 01:44:42,483
[shouting]

1086
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:45,194
[speaking foreign language]

1087
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:03,671
Cover us.

1088
01:45:03,839 --> 01:45:06,882
Pete. Pete.

1089
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,884
Gimme that blanket.

1090
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:11,137
Pete.

1091
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,472
- Take off his clothes.
- Pete.

1092
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,980
Jesus... Pete.

1093
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:24,984
- You know the way to the airport?
- Yes, Major.

1094
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,445
Get the hostages out of the truck
and put them in our vehicles.

1095
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:30,031
The Colonel will be waiting for you
at an orange grove behind the airport.

1096
01:45:30,198 --> 01:45:32,825
- Don't stop for anything, understand?
- Yes, sir.

1097
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,702
I'll take your bike.

1098
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:37,747
- What about you, Major?
- I've got some business to finish.

1099
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:40,249
Tell the colonel not to wait for me.

1100
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:43,753
I need more bandages.
There's too much blood.

1101
01:45:56,099 --> 01:45:57,933
[speaking foreign language]

1102
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:00,394
[music plays on TV]

1103
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,774
Going somewhere?

1104
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:10,214
[motorcycle revving]

1105
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:21,267

01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,473

[groaning]

1110
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:10,519
Pete.

1111
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:12,646
Hey, doc. Get on Pete here.

1112
01:50:12,814 --> 01:50:13,731
Keep it quiet.

1113
01:50:13,898 --> 01:50:17,192
Mike, bring my bag.
And the oxygen, too.

1114
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:29,079
- Looks like they're expecting us.
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:34,376
We're gonna have to find another way.

1116
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:36,337
Maybe we could cut
through the back fence.

1117
01:50:36,504 --> 01:50:37,504
Yeah.

1118
01:50:52,854 --> 01:50:54,271
Looks quiet.

1119
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,566
How many guards around the plane
do you figure?

1120
01:50:57,734 --> 01:51:00,569
I'd say between 12 and 16.

1121
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:02,571
Six of our men.

1122
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:47,032
- Oh!
- Ah!

1123
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:55,666
[grunting]

1124
01:52:03,925 --> 01:52:05,843
Ah! [yells]

[speaking foreign language]

1126
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,519
- [Nick] Do you speak English?
- [man] Yeah.

1127
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:17,938
[Nick] You wanna live, talk fast.
Who's in charge here?

1128
01:52:18,106 --> 01:52:19,565
Jaaffer. He is in the plane.

1129
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,233
- How many men does he have?
- Nobody.

1130
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:24,153
- Come on.
- I swear by Allah he is alone.

1131
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,154
What about the hostages?

1132
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:27,614
There are only three,
sleeping in the cockpit.

1133
01:52:27,782 --> 01:52:29,366
Do you have a password?

1134
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:31,744
If you wanna live, then use it.

1135
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,797
- Maybe he is asleep.
- Wake him up.

1136
01:52:43,965 --> 01:52:45,090
Jaaffer Iben Khalil.

1137
01:52:57,729 --> 01:52:59,772
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1138
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:04,485
Good morning, gentlemen.
Colonel Alexander. Delta Force.

1139
01:53:04,652 --> 01:53:06,570
- It's about time.
- Got enough fuel?

1140
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:08,572
- For what?
- To fly to Israel.

1141
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,199
You bet.

1142
01:53:10,366 --> 01:53:12,117
Need anything else
to get this thing off the ground?

1143
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:14,369
Yeah. A clear runway.

1144
01:53:14,537 --> 01:53:17,372
OK. All right, Jim, bring 'em in.
Bring 'em in.

1145
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:20,292
- Come on, gang.
- Let's get our butt moving.

1146
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,002
Let's go!

1147
01:53:54,577 --> 01:53:56,578
[shouting]

1148
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:24,273
Sit down in the rear and buckle up.
We gotta get out of here fast.

1149
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,483
Come on, move, move, move.

1150
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,698
[man] Everybody find a seat fast!

1151
01:54:36,327 --> 01:54:38,662
[indistinct shouts continue]

1152
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:43,917
Put him in first class.

1153
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:46,795
Keep moving. If they're not wounded,
move to the back of the plane.

1154
01:54:46,963 --> 01:54:48,589
Put him over there. Come on.

1155
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:51,758
Get 'em down there. Keep going.

1156
01:54:51,926 --> 01:54:54,136
Come on.
Are you all right? Get in the back.

1157
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:55,971
You, too.

1158
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:07,274
[man] Come on. Double time.
Let's go! Come on!

1159
01:55:10,403 --> 01:55:11,695
Pull it!

1160
01:55:17,827 --> 01:55:19,828
Where is that McCoy?

1161
01:55:26,544 --> 01:55:29,046
- Intercom check.
- Check.

1162
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:32,132
All right, Captain.
Everybody's onboard.

1163
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:34,092
Let's wind this son of a bitch up
and get outta here

1164
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:36,553
before the whole of Beirut shows up.

1165
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:38,055
You got it.

1166
01:55:38,222 --> 01:55:41,683
OK. High-pressure start... number two.

[speaking foreign language]

1168
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:10,545
Come on. Let's go. Close that hatch.

1169
01:56:10,713 --> 01:56:13,674
- Colonel, what about Major McCoy?
- We can't wait. He's always late.

1170
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:16,051
I gotta get these people outta here.
Come on, move!

1171
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:18,553
OK, gang, let's go.

1172
01:56:35,905 --> 01:56:38,782
Flight 282. Flight 282,
what are you doing?

1173
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:41,785
You have no authorization to move.

1174
01:56:41,953 --> 01:56:43,495
Stay where you are.

1175
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:48,083
Beirut, this is
American Travelways flight 282.

1176
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:51,628
I wanna thank you
for an interesting stay in Beirut.

1177
01:56:51,796 --> 01:56:53,839
Hope you all have a nice day.

1178
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:55,882
ATW 282, out.

[speaking foreign language]

1180
01:57:22,368 --> 01:57:24,453
Hell, they're shooting at us.

[screams]

1182
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:42,137

1183
01:58:01,491 --> 01:58:03,825
Colonel, it's the major!

1184
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,164
Well, come on. Get a rope down to him.

1185
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,196
Ready? OK.

1186
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:45,700
That's it. We got you.
Don't worry. Pull, pull!

1187
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:51,540
Steward, close the door.

1188
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:57,129
Let's go. Goose this bird
and let's get outta here.

1189
01:58:57,296 --> 01:58:58,547
I don't know that we have enough room.

1190
01:58:58,714 --> 01:59:00,882
We won't have a second chance.
Give it all you got.

1191
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:03,885
- All right. Here we go.
- [engines roaring]

1193
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:16,022
How's Pete?

1194
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:17,315
He's up front.

1195
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:20,944
Doc set up a hospital
in the first-class section.

1196

[all chattering]

1197
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:42,591
Hey, guys, Budweisers.
Let's pass 'em over.

1198
01:59:42,758 --> 01:59:46,011
Pass 'em over. There's lots more
where these came from.

1199
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:01,359
How is he, doc?

1200
02:00:11,954 --> 02:00:13,371
Boss.

1201
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:16,666
Hi, kid.

1202
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:21,713
Did we get 'em all out?

1203
02:00:22,924 --> 02:00:24,591
Yeah, we got 'em all.

1204
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,014
Are we goin' home now?

1205
02:00:34,018 --> 02:00:36,102
We're goin' home.

1206
02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:40,148
