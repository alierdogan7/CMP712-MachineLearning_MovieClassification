Sorry.

Okay.

Now,

185
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,069
Matt and I've been coming up to these
mountains with our dad all of our lives.

186

We can hunt, we can fish,
we can stay up here a long, long time.

You got him.

- He's still breathing.

Never shoot twice.

195
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,944
Shoot twice, they can find you.

Jedediah Smith and Jim Bridger.

would know right where you were.

It's not too bad.

206
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,091
It's kinda salty like a steak or
when you've got a nosebleed, you know.

207

You gotta do it. It's the spirit of the deer.

Where are you going?

530
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,109
You're so beautiful.
Wait, what's wrong with you?

531
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:41,546
Let's get her.

533
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,581

(IN RUSSIAN) It's cut... It's cut.

537
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,985
I've seen them before.

00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:02,592

Cambodia, Angola and Mexico.

at me for a minute.

542
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,549
- You bring girlfriend?
- Yeah.

543
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,989
Okay, I be right here. Bye.

544
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,162
(IN SPANISH) What is a '"Wolverine'"?

545
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,828
(RESPONDING IN SPANISH) A small animal

546
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:38,499
like a badger, but terribly ferocious.

547
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:43,499
It is also the name
of the local school sports collective.

548
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,569
They're beasts, Ernesto.

549
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,041
You must kill
every one of them eventually.

550
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:53,078
It's the same as Afghanistan.

551
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,050
They'll never stop.

552
00:50:56,019 --> 00:51:00,820
Look, I was always
on the side of the insurgents.

553
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,525
I have no experience in these matters

554
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:08,025
but it would seem necessary
to win the support of the people.

555
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,701
As our opponents used to say
in Vietnam,

556
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,103
'"Win their hearts and minds.'"

557
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,967
And they lost, Ernesto...

558
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,173
That is true, General.

559
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,644
Things are paralyzed at the front, Ernesto.

00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,876

about these '"Wolverines.'"

580
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,626
Well, I did fly an F-15.

Here.

00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,734

I got this off a dead Russian Major.

- Major, huh?
- Yeah.

586
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,557
I guess it ought to fit on a Colonel.

587
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,335
You the honcho, sport?

588
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,203

How did you
get yourself shot down, Colonel?

00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,541
It was five to one. I got four.

593
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,552
How are you doing, Jed?

594
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,022

597
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,431
Down here is Mexico.

598
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:19,138
First wave of the attack came in
disguised as a commercial charter flight,

599
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,547
same way they did in Afghanistan in '80.

600
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,916
Only they were crack airborne outfits.

601
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,119
They took these passes in the Rockies.

602
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,252
So that's what hit Calumet.

603
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,657
I guess so.

604
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,657
They coordinated
with selective nuke strikes,

605
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,959
and their missiles were hell of a lot
more accurate than we thought.

606
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,965
They took out silos here in the Dakotas

607
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,627
- and key points of communication.
- Like what?

608
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:44,134
Oh, like Omaha, Washington, Kansas City.

609
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,231
Gone?

610
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,435
- Yeah, that's right.
- Jesus Christ.

611
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,741
Infiltrators came up illegal from Mexico.

612
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,478
Cubans, mostly.

613
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,374
They managed to infiltrate

614
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,318
SAC bases in the Midwest,
several down in Texas.

615
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,981
Wreaked a hell of a lot of havoc.

616
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,621
They opened up the door down here

617
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,659
and the whole
Cuban and Nicaraguan armies

618
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,088
come walking right through,

619
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,792
rolled right up here
through the Great Plains.

620
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,598
How far did they get?

621
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,900
Cheyenne across to Kansas.

622
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:20,273
We held them at the Rockies
and at the Mississippi.

623
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:24,636
Anyway, the Russians reinforced
with 60 divisions.

624
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,448
Sent three whole army groups
across the Bering Strait, into Alaska.

625
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:32,147
Cut the pipeline, came across Canada
to link up here in the middle.

626
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,156
But we stopped their butt cold.

627
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,896
Lines have pretty much stabilized now.

628
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,061
What about Europe?

629
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,160
I guess they figured

630
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,664
twice in one century was enough.

631
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,045
They're sitting this one out.

632
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,172
All except England.

633
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,981
They won't last very long.

634
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,314
The Russians need to take us in one piece.
That's why they're here now.

635
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,381
That's why they won't use nukes anymore
and we won't either.

636
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,926
Not on our own soil.

637
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,690
The whole damn thing's
pretty conventional now.

638
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:18,460
Who knows?
Maybe next week will be swords.

639
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,100
What started it?

640
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,762
I don't know.
Two toughest kids on the block, I guess.

641
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,509
Sooner or later they're gonna fight.

642
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,009
That simple?

643
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,147
Maybe somebody forgot what it was like.

644
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,615
Who is on our side?

645
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,881
Six hundred million screaming Chinamen.

646
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,450
Last I heard,
there were a billion screaming Chinamen.

647
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,588
There were.

648
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,401
You got a family?

649
00:57:58,608 --> 00:57:59,836
I don't know.

650
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,582
They got caught behind the lines
down in Texas.

651
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,085
I like to think they're alive,

652
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,988
but I hear stories
about what they're doing to civilians.

653
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,856
Colonel.

654
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,623
- Get up.
- What?

655
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,999
We're taking off, we're gonna go
shoot up an armored column.

656
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,133
Let's go. Early bird gets the worm.

657
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,478
Early bird gets the worm.

658
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,612
Watch those claymores in the trees.

659
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,363
Matt, RPG!

660
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:45,241

Not bad for a bunch of kids, huh?

661
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,407

for eating beans every day?

There's half a million scarecrows in Denver

664

would give anything
for one mouthful of what you got.

665
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,530
They've been under siege
for about three months.

666
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:12,405
They live on rats and sawdust bread
and sometimes

667
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,071
on each other.

668
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,747

are we doing right?

She doesn't say much, does she?

679
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,081
No.

680
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,553
Something happened to her.

681
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,710
All right, plane, plane, plane, plane.

682
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:38,447
Cuban bunker, Russian bunker,
munitions dump, troop tents.

683
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:42,714
Machine gun bunkers here,
here, here, and here.

684
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:46,226
Back here by the drive-in screen
are your political prisoners.

685
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:50,060
All right. We'll cause a diversion over here,
cut holes in the wire here,

686
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,465
fire on these machine gun positions.

687
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:56,399
The B-group comes across this area
in a flanking maneuver.

688
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,133
When you reach this bunker

689
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,732
you lay down grazing fire on this duffle-A.

690
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,344
I think that's pretty simple.

691
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,406
Anybody got any questions so far?

692
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,146
What's a flank?

694
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,444
Yeah. What's grazing fire?

695
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,319
- I need a drink.
- Why don't we shoot at them?

01:46:58,178 --> 01:47:03,377
(MEN CHATTERING IN RUSSIAN)

1074
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:12,518
You lose.

1075
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:24,426
(COUGHS)

1076
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:03,872
(MUTTERING GOODBYE IN SPANISH)

1077
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:20,717
You can rest now.

1078
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,022
Just hang on, Matt.

1079
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:32,131
Oh, Matt.

1080
01:48:32,205 --> 01:48:34,435
It's okay, Matt. It's okay.

1081
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:37,773
Just hang on, Matt.
Daddy will be here soon, Matt.

1082
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:39,906
Hang on, Matt.

1083
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,117
Come on, Matt. Daddy will be here soon.

1084
01:48:55,595 --> 01:48:58,120
It's okay. Come on, Matt.

1085
01:49:06,573 --> 01:49:08,803
I'll hold you as long as I can, Matt.

1086
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:10,570
I'll hold you as long as I can.

1087
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:12,271
You can lean on me.

1088
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:18,343
I'm so tired.

1089
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:23,553
So tired.

1090
01:50:04,831 --> 01:50:06,162
We're free now.

1091
01:50:07,801 --> 01:50:08,995
Free.

1092
01:50:23,149 --> 01:50:25,174
ERICA: I never saw the brothers again

1093
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:26,951
In time, this war,

1094
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:29,087
like every other war, ended

1095
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:31,347
But I never forgot

1096
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:33,549
And I come to this place often

1097
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:35,959
Though no one else does

1098
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:40,424
In the early days of World War III,

1099
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:43,128
guerillas, mostly children,

1100
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:46,601
placed the names
of their lost upon this rock

1101
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:48,698
They fought here alone

1102
01:50:48,775 --> 01:50:50,743
and gave up their lives

1103
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:54,780
so that this nation
shall not perish from the earth

1104
01:53:58,344 --> 01:53:59,780
{{ the end }}
