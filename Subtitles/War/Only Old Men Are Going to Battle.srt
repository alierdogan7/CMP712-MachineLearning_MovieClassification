16
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
That was a hell of a battle!
I thought it was the end.

17
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
- How's the machine?
- Great.

18
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
I got to his tail,
and he from his back... like hell!

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
He just waved his tail,
and that was the last I saw of him.

20
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,665
Why did you stay so far behind?

21
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,700
You see,
I thought my guns got jammed.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All right, time to fill up.

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
And he's dragging on a left turn...

24
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,167
The dumplings are getting cold.

25
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:40,065
- With cherries?
- With cheese.

26
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
Comrade Commander,
the mission's been completed.

27
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:43,265
What did you see?

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,100
He was all in smoke,
but I didn't see him fall.

29
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:48,400
- That's not it.
- May I?

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,765
What did you see?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
From the first 10, we shot down 2,
the rest cleared off.

32
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,365
That's not it.
Vano, what did you see?

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Four Fokkers were forcing us down,
but we slipped away and came to you.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I shot it down! I did!
I shot it down, Comrade Commander.

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Oh-oh-oh, what have you done?

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,800
Your parents should be
called to the principal.

37
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,400
- Tomorrow.
- Right.

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
- I swear I did.
- I guess, out off right.

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Congratulations on your first victory!

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,165
But remember,
Ivan Fyodorovich,

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
shooting down enemy
planes is not an exploit,

42
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
it's the duty of fighters,
it's our everyday life.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And what did you see?

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
- In battle?
- Yes.

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Don't prompt him.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Greetings, Second.
Gimme some milk.

47
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:44,500
You alive?
Broke your paw?

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Ten holes, the tank torn out,
as for me, not a scratch.

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
How do you say it, Maestro?
We'll live on. Thanks.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,165
You're welcome.

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
So, what did you see?

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,965
Haven't you noticed?

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Today we were fighting
over my Ukraine!

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
How can one notice?
The same fields, roads, villages.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No.
The air is different.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,065
The sky is bluer, the earth is greener.

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Commander, as for
greenery, in our Siberia...

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,565
Why Siberia, my dear?

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Come to Bakuriani,
you'll see the real greenery.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,200
- Have you ever seen the Yenisey?
- No, I haven't.

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
And have you seen the Tsenitskhali?

62
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:30,100
There they go...

63
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,750
Quiet.

64
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:35,300
A lark.

65
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,165
Based upon
the reminiscences

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
of Soviet pilots fighting
in the Great Patriotic War,

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,465

Give me First.
Give me first squadron!

79
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Comrade flyers,
please don't go away.

80
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,500
Captain Dementyev, come to me.

81
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,817
Give me first squadron!

82
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:38,100
- Comrade...
- Later.

83
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Comrade Commander, we've got
reinforcement. What do we do?

84
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,900
- Get the third up.
- Yes!

85
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,517
I'm First.
Ninth, answer me.

86
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:50,100
Ninth, answer me.
I'm First.

87
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,365
The wireless is too weak, it won't do.

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,365
- Get a strong one!
- That's only in the division.

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,200
Get it in the division! You're
a communications man, not a balalaika.

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Maestro, answer me.
Maestro, I'm First.

91
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Maestro, answer me. I'm First.

92
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Commander, miracles do not happen.

93
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
He's been out of fuel
for 30 minutes now.

94
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Shall we deal with the reinforcement?

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They should be assigned
to squadrons.

96
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
It's never late to assign

97
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
the living to the living.

98
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,865
Comrade Guards Major,

99
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,900
I got a new comedy in the division,
"George from Dinki-Jazz".

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They gave it to us, but Regiment 125
intercepted it. It's robbery.

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
- What did they intercept?
- "From Dinki-Jazz".

102
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:50,100
What jazz?

103
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
From Dinki.

104
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Off you go!
Why is everybody here?

105
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,365
Everyone go to supper.

106
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Do you need
a special invitation?

107
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Oh, it's you, Sergey.

108
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
He ordered me to lead everybody away,
but I'm No. 2.

109
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,565
I wasn't supposed
to leave him alone.

110
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Stop torturing yourself.
You had to carry out the order.

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
- I know.
- Go and have supper.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
It'll be windy tomorrow.

113
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:51,500
Looks like it.

114
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Forty-seven minutes.

115
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I need a pipe changed
in the engine.

116
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,900
And the storeman won't give it.

117
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Please, order him to.

118
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
You never stop begging. You'll
leave the regiment without spare parts.

119
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,100
All right, tell him it's my order.

120
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
They brought "George from Dinki-Jazz. "

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A comedy, they say.

122
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah...

123
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Come on, enough of that.

124
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
- Free here?
- Occupied.

125
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
- May I?
- I said it's occupied.

126
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Let's go over there.

127
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
The Messers!

128
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Makarych, accept the machine.
Here, I swapped it without bargaining.

129
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
You can get to its tail,
the dragon doesn't bite anymore.

130
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,465
And I...

131
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
got connecting pipes
for our Niner.

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The Niner is kaput.

133
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,565
- Everybody got back?
- Right!

134
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
- Why are you so gloomy then?
- Mourning the Niner.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Comrade Commander, I was shot
down while on a fighting mission.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Couldn't make it over the front line.

137
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,800
The infantry helped me out,
attacking just in time.

138
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:22,800
Guys at the airfield
gave me a new Messer.

139
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,565
Hi, pop.

140
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Hi, you lucky devil!

141
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
The parachute's kaput, too.

142
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
That's it. The second to rehearsal.

143
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,365
Come on.

144
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Everyone, who can tell the 'do' note
from the 'fa' note, follow me!

145
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,700
That amateur talent business again!
The pilots ought to rest.

146
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Who said songs at war
should be dropped as such?

147
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
After a fight one yearns
for music twice as much.

148
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,165
Start'er up!

149
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Today we have a respite,

150
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Tomorrow we'll fly again...

151
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Those evening bells,

152
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Those evening bells!

153
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
So many thoughts

154
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Their sound spells.

155
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Of days of youth

156
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
In my home nest,

157
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Where I was in love,

158
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Where my parents rest...

159
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,900
You see, our Chairman was like that...

160
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,365
Attention! At ease!

161
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
It's kindergarten, not reinforcement.
Follow me!

162
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,700
Curly maple,
leaves so intricately cut,

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
By love smitten, I'm standing...

164
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
You'll get a punch.

165
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
- What are we doing?
- Washing, Comrade Commander.

166
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,765
You want a punch? Oh!

167
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
- Sorry, Comrade Captain.
- Guards Captain.

168
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Yes, sir,
Guards Comrade Captain.

169
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,700
Greetings,
Comrade Commander!

170
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
- Training?
- Yes.

171
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,700
It develops the vestibular apparatus.

172
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Go on, work out.

173
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,265
Attention!

174
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
At ease, Cossacks.

175
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,665
What's new on the musical front?

176
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,100
- "On a Sunny Glade".
- We heard it.

177
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:40,117
- "Blue Kerchief".
- I see.

178
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,100
- "Dugout".
- Good song.

179
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,500
May I join the line?

180
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,700
You may.
What tune were you singing?

181
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,365
Darkie.

182
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Sing it. You know the words?

183
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't chicken, Darkie.
You're a fighter pilot.

184
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,665
Well, it goes like this.

185
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,700
In the summer, in the morning,
At a garden I dropped once.

186
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
There was a girl, a Moldavian darkie,
She was gathering some grapes.

187
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm blushing, I'm paling,
I'm about to tell her that...

188
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,500
Comrade Commander, please enlist me
into your second squadron.

189
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:16,700
- Me too.
- Me too.

190
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,265
And us, too.

191
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
- What school?
- Orenburg. Accelerated training.

192
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:25,300
I see. Takeoff-landing.
What do you play?

193
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
- Meaning?
- Musically.

194
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,465
Nothing.

195
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
You don't have to be a pilot,
we'll teach you flying anyway,

196
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,950
But a musician you have to be.

197
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:41,600
- I think he's weird.
- What?

198
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:42,765
School?

199
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,500
Dutar... I mean, Orenburg.

200
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,200
A dutar, I brought it with me.

201
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,265
A harp.

202
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,300
But I've hated music since I was a kid.
We're at war, anyway.

203
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Wars come and go,
and music remains.

204
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
My dad said so too. he's a prominent
professor, a paleobotanist.

205
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
So you're a child prodigy?

206
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm here not to enroll at
a philharmony, but to fight.

207
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
- Junior Lieutenant Antonov.
- Here!

208
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,265
- First squadron.
- Yes!

209
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,500
- Junior Lieutenant Zairov.
- Here!

210
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:23,500
- Second squadron.
- Yes!

211
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
- Junior Lieutenant Sabdullayev.
- Here!

212
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,300
Second squadron.

213
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:30,565
Yes!

214
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,200
- Junior Lieutenant Shchedronov.
- Here!

215
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,000
Second squadron.

216
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,965
Yes!

217
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Tomorrow, at most the day after
tomorrow, the war will be over.

218
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,100
As soon as they know
about our reinforcement,

219
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:48,100
the Luftwaffe will run for their lives.

220
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,965
- Eagles.
- Wolves.

221
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Cadet... Lieutenant Alexandrov.

222
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
Why are you standing there?
Second squadron.

223
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,365
Yes!

224
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,265
Right dress! Attention!

225
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,965
- As you were.
- As you were.

226
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Here're your horses, here're your
mechanic nannies. Get acquainted.

227
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,765
Eagles!

228
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
- Who's Alexandrov here?
- I'm Lieutenant Alexandrov.

229
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,400
- I'm your mechanic.
- Are you? Great!

230
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,865
Are there enough planes?

231
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
don't fear, you won't be left without
a horse.

232
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Lieutenant, no smoking
around the plane.

233
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,165
I'm not inhaling.

234
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
No matter, step aside, please.

235
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:32,065
What? You don't like me?

236
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
- Why are you staring like that?
- You're my fifth.

237
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Well, get ready to form
a winged line...

238
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
we'll see how you sing in the air.

239
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,165
Who's the bravest?

240
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Everybody is brave, but the most
experienced... Allow takeoff?

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Comrade Commander, a flare.

242
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,700
On the bridgehead across the Dnieper
the Germans are attacking our troops.

243
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
The reinforcements
are being sent there.

244
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
The enemy airplanes
are rushing to the crossing.

245
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,165
About 50 Junkerses are approaching.

246
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Not one bomb
should fall on the crossing.

247
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,100
We're going by shelves.
Solomatin will cover.

248
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,565
As usual.

249
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,865
- Titarenko among the attackers.
- Yes.

250
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Kolosov, I'm going with you.
No talking on the approach, not a word.

251
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,065
Didn't I tell you?

252
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
It goes for you, too.
No jokes.

253
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
- Got you.
- It's his nerves.

254
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,865
We fly in 12 minutes.

255
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,900
No rookies today.
Only old men are going to battle.

256
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,765
- What about us?
- Take us too.

257
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
- We won't let you down.
- don't be in a hurry.

258
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
You'll have your share of battle.

259
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Missed. And I'm going to hit...

260
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Thanks, do your job.

261
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
You got it.

262
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Do you have nothing else to do?
Fighters!

263
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Study the map of the battle area,
as all men do.

264
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
B-5.

265
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
You've sunk it.

266
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,600
Attention! At ease.

267
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
You've got it coming!..

268
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,100
- How's the machine?
- What's wrong with the gun?

269
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:11,100
It was in order.

270
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
- Comrade Commander...
- Later!

271
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Why did you leave the battle?
Got jammed again?

272
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Yes, jammed again.

273
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Send me to the tribunal, Commander.

274
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Alyosha, the gun's all right.

275
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You just shot it empty.

276
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
All right.
All right, Makarych.

277
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
What? Did you get it hot?

278
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Worse.

279
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Haven't you had your supper?

280
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Why did you go wild? The harder
you train, the better you'll fight.

281
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,365
Some maestro, my ass.

282
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Calm down. From the start, and...

283
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,365
he's such a great dog!

284
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
When Germans came to the village,
they shot all dogs.

285
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
But Lyuba hid this one so well!

286
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
He doesn't know how to bark.

287
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Good evening to your hearth.
Got enough potatoes?

288
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,765
Sit down.

289
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
What's the name of that wolfhound?

290
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,900
Just like yours.

291
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,700
Alyoshka?

292
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,365
Oh, you!

293
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,365
Put out the fire!

294
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,965
- You've been relieved, soldier?
- Yes.

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Take the kids to the mess.
They should be fed.

296
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:06,600
Yes! Come on, guys.

297
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,965
Shall we uncork it?

298
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
we'll do without warming up.

299
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
I see. We're in
for a serious talk.

300
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
What's the matter with you, Seryoga?
You're a fighter pilot.

301
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,165
I know everything you're going to say.

302
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
There's no more fighter pilot, Lyosha.
That's it.

303
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
- I'm a coward, Commander.
- Seryoga.

304
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Shut up, Lyosha. Shut up.

305
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,465
I'm broken.

306
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,465
Remember Poneri?

307
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,500
We're liars, we like
to say that the German is a coward,

308
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,300
that he's afraid of frontal attack,
that he's sure to swerve.

309
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,965
And mine hadn't swerved.

310
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So that my planes ripped off, one wing
to the left, the other to the right.

311
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I came to on the ground.
My Yak was burning down.

312
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
And I saw cherries
bloom in my eyes.

313
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
- We fight to death, Seryoga.
- I know, Lyosha.

314
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700
But believe me, I swear by mother,
I didn't mean to leave the battle.

315
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I controlled the machine, with my
hands in place.

316
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm burning to fight, but as...

317
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
It flares up...

318
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,365
When I came to my senses,

319
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,400
the fight going the hell knows where,
and I dropped out.

320
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,650
I guess I want to live.

321
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:12,492
You can't escape the war.

322
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,413
You can't escape yourself.

323
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:18,300
That's what's most horrible.

324
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Send me to the tribunal, Commander.

325
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Here, an application for my transfer.

326
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,065
Where?

327
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,650
To the infantry.

328
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:40,165
To hell, damn it!

329
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
To the penal battalion.

330
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:45,400
To hell?

331
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
And who's going to shoot down Fritzes?
Me and those rookies?

332
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,400
This is all
I can do for you.

333
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,965
As for helping you...

334
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
There're moments in life
when nobody can help you.

335
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
You come into this world on your own
and you die on your own.

336
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,200
Well, the host won't offer us any tea.
Let's get to business. Give me the map.

337
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Sit down. Will you ever get yourself
a map-case, or shall I give you one?

338
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
- One's boot is safer in battle.
- In battle, yes.

339
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,000
According to the partisans,
information, the enemy's transferring

340
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:52,000
a large grouping of tanks
to our bridgehead.

341
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,700
This information hasn't been confirmed,
so off you fly,

342
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
hover above the roofs, peek into the
barrels of guns, but find the tanks.

343
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Let me fly the trophy.

344
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,365
The Messer?

345
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,865
You may be shot down by our own.

346
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,900
But over there
I can fly like at home.

347
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's not a bad idea.
we'll warn our people.

348
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Feel out this forest. You'll come
in there from the enemy side.

349
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,900
And come out at Nekrasovka.

350
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Only no tricks.
I know you.

351
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,400
No engagements,
you're not to be spotted.

352
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,200
May I go and carry out the mission?

353
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,800
- Come back alive.
- Yes.

354
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:45,800
Good luck.

355
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Well, Ivan, let's check out
the reinforcement.

356
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Perhaps... some tea first?

357
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
You think while we sit drinking tea,

358
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,300
they'll take the downed
plane off the runway?

359
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,300
You softy!

360
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Turn it the hell down!

361
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,400
About face, damn it!
Get out of my sight!

362
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
I'm off on a mission. You're
in charge of those. Drill them.

363
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,700
- Me?
- Yes, you!

364
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
"I don't know, Comrade Commander. "

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Catching grasshoppers.

366
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,700
No flights.
No vodka ration.

367
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
A permanent duty
as an airfield attendant.

368
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,765
Grasshopper!

369
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,700
- Where are you flying?
- Straight ahead, to the west.

370
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,765
In such weather...

371
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Makarych, there's a persistent rumor
at Hitler's headquarters

372
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,800
that some Soviet aces

373
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,900
are given a cross before a flight by
politically-backward mechanics.

374
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,700
They're all weirdoes at Hitler's
headquarters.

375
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
- Start'er up!
- Yes, start'er up!

376
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,800
Flying in such weather!

377
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,065
What Jupiter can...

378
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,100
Shall we fly more today?

379
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Enough screwing for today.
Learn the theory.

380
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,665
Give me your paw for luck, my friend.

381
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Cheer up, Grasshopper. Do your duty,
and the commander may cool off.

382
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,900
Be thankful for that. It could be worse.

383
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:44,365
As Shakespeare said...

384
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
- And who's that?
- Must be some big wig.

385
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Soldier's wisdom:

386
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Stay away from big wigs,
but closer to the kitchen. Come on.

387
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Guys.

388
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
- Excuse me, is that the mail?
- Or maybe an army shop?

389
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
- Got lost, girls?
- Oh, look, a dog.

390
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:32,000
- Why don't you say hello, boys?
- Hello.

391
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,565
Let's go.

392
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
A good point. A reprimand to
everybody, comrade flyers.

393
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,400
- Got it.
- Follow me.

394
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:43,400
Lift it!

395
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,665
Come on.

396
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Pardon me, this is men's job.

397
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,600
- Ivan, work.
- Yes!

398
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,300
Lift it!

399
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,800
- Where do you run the thread here?
- What thread?

400
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:01,800
This is a flying sewing
machine, isn't it?

401
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Push it. You should've seen how
the Messers grilled us today.

402
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Oh, you fly too?

403
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,500
- I'm sorry.
- It's nothing.

404
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:18,265
Our dear U-2!

405
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,865
A hard-working horse.

406
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,900
Never mind, one day
we'll put a monument to you.

407
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,650
Thank you.

408
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:32,100
Not at all.

409
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,800
- Are you from Moscow?
- Yes.

410
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Oh, our neighbors!
First squadron, come here!

411
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,100
The night-timers came from
the neighboring regiment.

412
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:46,100
How was your flight?
I'm Petya, by the way.

413
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
Nice to meet you.

414
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,065
Good!

415
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,365
Greetings to you, girls-in-arms!

416
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,565
- What's wrong?
- A hole in the petrol pipe.

417
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Our mechanics will fix your biplane
in a jiffy... I'm Petya, by the way.

418
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,965
Stay cool.

419
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,565
don't you believe me?

420
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Incidentally, these are
the guests of the second squadron.

421
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,265
The best mechanics are here.

422
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,300
As is our
traditional hospitality.

423
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
So you can lay off, Vasya.

424
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,565
A Messer!

425
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Calm down, it's our guy.
It's Maestro.

426
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,500
After hard
and exhausting battles,

427
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,800
when you go into a frontal attack,

428
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,900
when a German ace's scowling
face is in front of you,

429
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,300
when you can see...
rivets on the enemy planes,

430
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
we, fighters, need
an emotional let-out.

431
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,400
And here we're helped by music. For
everything passes, but music remains.

432
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,300
And as Shakespeare said
in his 18th sonnet...

433
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,250
Hi, boys.

434
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:29,965
Hi, girls.

435
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What did Shakespeare say?

436
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,265
Well...

437
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,300
And not in the 18th, but...

438
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,965
In the 19th?

439
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
In the 19th sonnet Shakespeare said...

440
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,100
Lay off, Vasya.

441
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,467
Let's go.

442
00:34:52,502 --> 00:34:54,501
Hey, orators!

443
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,465
Some discipline!

444
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Why are you leaving your own home
without your superior's permission?

445
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Where's your traditional
hospitality, fighters?

446
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Yes, Comrade First, it's been
confirmed, we found them.

447
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,050
Where we supposed they were.

448
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,565
Yes, he sure flew over there.

449
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
- How many times?
- Four times over their heads.

450
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,800
I flew 4 times.

451
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,900
An arrogant general
sitting on a white horse there.

452
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,300
- You even saw his shoulder-straps?
- I was flying pretty low.

453
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,500
Vassily Vassilyevich, First's waiting.

454
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,965
- Don't see me off.
- Thank you.

455
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Punch a hole for a decoration, Maestro.

456
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Valya, give me Pop's "Kazbek"
cigarette.

457
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,900
I got Prokhorovka
on an aerial photograph.

458
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,900
I'll go to the lab and check it.

459
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
- How did the hosts receive you?
- All right.

460
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,265
But what the cheek!

461
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
Did you report everything, my dear
friend?

462
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,900
- Everything. Good tobacco.
- Yeah, good. And what then?

463
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You won't believe it.
Like in an operetta.

464
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
The tanks, and that one on a white
horse waved to me like this...

465
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,365
And you?...

466
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,965
I waved to him once, too.

467
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,500
I had to punish him, it's not 1941 now.

468
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,700
You were ordered not to reveal
yourself.

469
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Ah, what the heck. Sitting like that
on a white horse, bastard...

470
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,800
I'll remind you of
that white horse yet.

471
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,900
- May I go?
- You mean you'll go like that?

472
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
- I don't understand.
- What's happened to people?

473
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
You're not going to invite
your comrade-in-arms and commander?

474
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,165
Invite where?

475
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,200
The whole regiment is rushing
to the second squadron now.

476
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,400
May I?

477
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,400
May I?

478
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,065
May I?

479
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,100
I meant to ask you.
If...

480
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Got you.

481
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
- Granny, let's dance.
- Not me!

482
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,700
we'll show them how to dance!

483
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:43,700
But they don't dance.

484
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,665
Why don't we dance?

485
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,700
We had our dance,
I guess, back in Spain.

486
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Oh, no.

487
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,500
May I?

488
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,900
May I, Comrade Commander?

489
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,300
Did you see that?
They can't fly.

490
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
They can't shoot yet, either.
But they're real eagles!

491
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Everybody come here.

492
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
All this is fine, but it's
just a consumers, cooperative.

493
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Dear guests of the second squadron,
please come to our philharmonic hall.

494
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Curtain!

495
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Our singing second has another profile.

496
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We believe that a song is like
geography.

497
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Here's Zoya from Siberia, a stern and
mighty land. So are its songs.

498
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
A storm was raging, thundering...

499
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Vano. Georgia. Mountains.
A Caucasian rhythm.

500
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And I'm from Tauria, Southern Ukraine.

501
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,700
The steppe, as even as a table.

502
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,800
(speaks in Ukrainian)

503
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,700
It's Milky Way in Russian.

504
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Our songs are as
endless as the steppe itself.

505
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You understand it's not singing,
it's just a sketch of singing.

506
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,900
And now you'll hear
the best soloist

507
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
of the first Ukrainian,
the former Voronezh,

508
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,600
the future soloist of the Bolshoi
Theatre...

509
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:56,300
- Very big.
- Very big theatre.

510
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Senior Lieutenant Skvortsov!

511
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
(speaks in Ukrainian)

512
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Commander.

513
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,700
Cancelled for technical reasons.

514
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Maestro.

515
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,865
don't you let me down.

516
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,900
The season's first.
There's no harp. Take a tambourine.

517
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Start'er up!

518
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,200
In the summer, in the morning,
At a garden I dropped once.

519
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
There's a girl, a Moldavian darkie,
She was gathering the grapes.

520
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,900
I'm blushing, I'm paling,
I'm about to suggest:

521
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,200
"Let's go to the river
To watch summer dawn at its best. "

522
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Curly maple,
leaves so intricately cut,

523
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,100
By love smitten, I'm standing
all distraught.

524
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,300
Curly maple, so bushy a maple,

525
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Its leaves so beautifully cut!

526
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
And the girl, the Moldavian darkie,
Told the boy all at once:

527
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,100
"We're forming in Moldavia
A detachment of partisans.

528
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Our men have left their homes
Early on, before the dawn.

529
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,400
So go to the partisans,
To the woods you go on. "

530
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Curly maple,
leaves so intricately cut,

531
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,900
Here, by the maple, you and I
will have to part.

532
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:54,867
Curly maple, so bushy a maple,

533
00:41:54,902 --> 00:41:57,800
Its leaves so beautifully cut!

534
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,300
Comrade Guards Major, may I
address Comrade Captain?

535
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,365
You may.

536
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,865
Good evening.

537
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,900
Comrade Captain, while some
were doing la-la-la here,

538
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,500
the 1st squadron have got everything
for the repair ofyour cruiser.

539
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,550
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

540
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:34,565
Good boys, our first squadron.

541
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,300
When it comes to downing the Messers,
it's the second squadron,

542
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
but as to getting things, it's the 1st
squadron.

543
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Curly maple,
leaves so intricately cut.

544
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,700
Hello, darling,
now we'll never have to part!

545
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,950
Curly maple, so bushy a maple,

546
00:42:55,985 --> 00:42:58,800
Its leaves so beautifully cut!

547
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,200
Comrade Regiment Commander,
the U-2 is ready.

548
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:25,965
Thank you.

549
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
- Start'er up.
- Yes!

550
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,900
That's all.

551
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,700
Well, he's got your left hand.

552
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Our Romeo from Tashkent is sulking.

553
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,750
His Juliet left in a biplane.

554
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:37,465
Lieutenant,
stop being cheap.

555
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,500
I got your message, I'll keep mum,
or I'll be beaten by you neat

556
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,100
and never shall perform my feat.

557
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Look, I don't know what kind
of a feat we're going to perform,

558
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,500
but the fact that this
girl fights in the war, it's...

559
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Not enough paint.

560
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,450
What about you?

561
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:10,392
You may use it.

562
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:12,265
Leave the paint!

563
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,300
- There're no tanks there.
- I believe Titarenko like myself.

564
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,500
I do, too. Yet the low-flying planes
and our neighbors were there as nothing!

565
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,600
- They found no tanks.
- That's why they're not Guards.

566
00:45:22,635 --> 00:45:25,600
All right, Guards pilot,
don't get riled up.

567
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,200
150 tanks are not a matchbox.
How can one hide them?

568
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,300
When is he going to land?

569
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,100
Second squadron. As soon...
Stop munching!

570
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,200
As Titarenko lands, let him report
at once.

571
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,150
That Uzbek boy of yours has guts.

572
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:51,300
Wait and you'll see him a soloist.

573
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:54,300
we'll wait and see.

574
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,700
What are they doing?!

575
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:00,400
Turn!
Titarenko, turn!

576
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Is he nuts, that soloist of yours?!

577
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Ninth, go to a landing.

578
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,300
Oh, it's not cold at all.

579
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:44,000
The soloist is coming.

580
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
In a frontal attack a hypothetical
enemy's been hypothetically shot down.

581
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,600
May I have your remarks?

582
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,300
All right, we'll get along.
But you have to work on your turns.

583
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,600
5- minute smoke break for the old men.
Rookies, come here.

584
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,465
- Darkie!
- Here.

585
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Well, kids, tomorrow we go to battle.

586
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,100
In your first battle, most important
is not to fall back from the leader.

587
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,200
You may not shoot down enemy planes,
you may not even shoot.

588
00:47:13,235 --> 00:47:15,665
But if you hold on to the leader's
tail, you can fly.

589
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,700
But once you gape, they'll eat you
alive, and you can blame only yourself.

590
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,765
Remember three "no's".

591
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
In battle you can't be blind.
Turn your head 360°.

592
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,465
Second...

593
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,165
- Grasshopper.
- Here.

594
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,200
Go to the commander.
he's in great spirits!

595
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,800
Third, never leave your
comrade when he's in trouble.

596
00:47:40,835 --> 00:47:43,000
Better die yourself, but help your
friend out.

597
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,100
And fourth, never keep a fighter
on a permanent duty.

598
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,665
Please let me fly.

599
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,700
And fifth, you can't
interrupt your seniors in rank.

600
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,200
- You may go.
- Yes!

601
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,065
You too.

602
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,850
Grasshopper was the best at school.

603
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:01,600
Comrade Commander,
he's not 18 yet.

604
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,300
To get enrolled at school,
he added himself a year.

605
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,300
- he's a great guy!
- For how long has he to be on duty?

606
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,065
Until he comes of age.

607
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,100
You're called to the command post.

608
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,665
I was watching.

609
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Good work! But you have
to make way for your elders.

610
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
In a streetcar, not in battle.

611
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,800
we'll get along.

612
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,900
You mean I flew to my mother-in-law's
and gave you some baloney?

613
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,565
But they couldn't
vanish into thin air,

614
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,600
those damned tanks, and they
couldn't draw them off so quickly.

615
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,700
May I fly again?

616
00:48:40,735 --> 00:48:42,365
Come on, wait...

617
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,665
- Where are they, then?
- Allow me to fly.

618
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,700
And order to put a photo camera
onboard, if my word is not enough.

619
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,800
You're stubborn, aren't you?

620
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:53,565
- Here.
- What for?

621
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Too bad we don't have enough hay.

622
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,700
It eats a lot of it. What about yours?

623
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,665
Leave the hay!

624
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,700
Maestro, what was that roundabout
you had up there?

625
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,565
A training battle.

626
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,250
- And how was it?
- All right.

627
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,865
Who was it that pressed you so?

628
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,900
I told them about frontal attack.
And he went head-on and didn't turn.

629
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,800
I couldn't turn either, after all
I'm a Hero of the Soviet Union.

630
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,665
And girls stare at you at the mess.

631
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,600
It's not my character to turn,
but he went on and on.

632
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:32,600
- So you had to swerve?
- Not to mess things up.

633
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,900
- They're good boys, we'll get along.
- Hurry up, men.

634
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,500
The Germans are transferring our old
acquaintances to the Kiev area.

635
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean Goring's best carrion crows.

636
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,565
Thanks for good news.

637
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,800
Why should they come here before
the start?

638
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:49,700
Enough of your superstitions.

639
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:52,700
It's not good. Well...

640
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,900
It doesn't count.

641
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
don't swap it for a tank!

642
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,165
Starlet, I'm Maestro!

643
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,200
The irons are in place, camouflaged
as haycocks. Quadrant 19.

644
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,900
- Roger, Maestro!
- Quadrant 19, copy.

645
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,300
- Roger.
- Say hello to the neighbors.

646
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,765
How are you?

647
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,800
- How are you, Maestro?
- All right, I'm falling.

648
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,100
Guys, I'm one of you, a Soviet.

649
00:51:25,135 --> 00:51:27,900
You say Soviet? There you go!

650
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,965
Check out my uniform.

651
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,765
he's even donned our uniform!

652
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,800
- Oh, holy shit!
- He even swears in our tongue!

653
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,700
Go to hell, the queen of fields!

654
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
He seems to be ours.

655
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,900
And let my regiment know
that I'm alive and well.

656
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,300
Very warm hospitality.

657
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,800
- I'll get there.
- we'll provide you with transportation.

658
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
we'll fix you up,
and you'll be great.

659
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,700
This is pure stuff.
We keep it for our guests.

660
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Fomin, drop your accordion.
Water for our guest.

661
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,765
Yes!

662
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Let's have one for the road and to
friendship between arms of the service.

663
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,165
- Some friendship.
- don't be pissed off.

664
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,200
One Messer has been bombing
our first-aid post for a week.

665
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,500
Chose the red cross
as his target, bastard.

666
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,700
The boys took you for him
and got a bit overexcited.

667
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
You're lucky you're alive.
Well, aviation...

668
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,865
To our victory.

669
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,900
we'll live on, infantry.

670
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,500
You're a hell of a drinker!

671
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:07,800
A fighter drinker!

672
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:10,800
All right!

673
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,700
TO KIEV!

674
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,665
Halt! Who's coming?

675
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,065
Not coming, but riding. Dnieper.

676
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,800
Volga. Go on.
Greetings, Comrade Commander.

677
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:54,800
Hi!

678
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Makarych, accept the machine.
I swapped it without bargaining.

679
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Sorry, they didn't offer me a tank.

680
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,150
Who?

681
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:22,700
Darkie.

682
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,600
How did it happen?

683
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,400
They worked on flying in pairs.
Suddenly 4 Fokkers out of the blue.

684
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,300
I've never seen them like that.
All painted up with diamond aces.

685
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,100
Pop on the wireless: "Go away. "
But how? They were in the clutches.

686
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Here comes Darkie:
Cover me. I'll attack. Well...

687
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,100
He was just a kid. Got carried away.

688
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,900
He should have gone on a turn,
but he persisted, and...

689
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,400
A daring devil.
What a guy!

690
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,200
When we got up, no more Fokkers.

691
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,700
And he was burning down in the weeds.

692
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,300
Those are his things.

693
00:55:12,335 --> 00:55:14,665
Yesenin's poems.

694
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,700
His tunic... over there.

695
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,300
And Aunt Dusya.

696
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,700
His mother.

697
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,700
How are they going to tell Aunt Dusya
that he's... gone.

698
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Missing in action is better.

699
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,200
We were together in school.

700
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,900
You know, Vitya and I
lived in the same house.

701
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,300
When they were seeing us off at the
station, all the boys played the fool.

702
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
And Vitya turned around...

703
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,365
and said:

704
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,400
"Look how old our
mothers turned in a moment.

705
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,600
Just in a moment... "

706
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,900
Stop crying.

707
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,400
How do you say "sky"?

708
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,900
And "earth"?

709
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,300
And "cherry tree"?

710
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,600
Only it's not cherry, but an apple tree.

711
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,500
Makes no difference.

712
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,765
It smells of home.

713
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,800
A poplar is my home country's tree.

714
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,400
Only ours are tall,
Lombardy poplars.

715
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,100
And how do you say "home"?

716
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,565
Such a long word?

717
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,600
In Uzbek, it means
"I love you, Masha. "

718
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,600
Girls, Romeo and Masha are coming.

719
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,965
Masha.

720
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,200
- I got to go.
- Romeo!

721
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:52,865
Yes.

722
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,900
I'll be in trouble if...

723
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,965
- Sure.
- Romeo!

724
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Only you go first.
I can't look back.

725
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,965
All right.

726
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
- Don't look back either.
- Right.

727
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,100
- Well, I'm going.
- Goodbye.

728
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,600
Goodbye.

729
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,800
- Good luck.
- Goodbye.

730
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We never look back!

731
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,300
Novokov.

732
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,400
- Congratulations!
- I won't let you down.

733
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,600
Kozhanov.

734
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,565
Kozhanov!

735
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,600
No more flying for Kozhanov.

736
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Titarenko.

737
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,600
Congratulations!

738
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,865
Want to say something?

739
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,700
No, I'm not good at talking.
I'll say my word in battle.

740
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,700
Good point.

741
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,200
Our party is
8 men stronger now.

742
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,800
- 6 men.
- 8 men, Komsomol leader.

743
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,000
Eight.

744
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,100
Congratulations, communists.

745
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,200
And you, Titarenko, will get
a mission from the Party right away.

746
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Sit down, comrades.

747
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,865
Sit down.

748
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,900
You've already met
those Goring's diamond aces.

749
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,665
They can burn very well.

750
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,700
Come on, you shouldn't
underestimate the enemy.

751
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,165
The German man is a serious man.

752
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,200
But they do burn very well, and you
should explain it to the young boys.

753
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,800
All this hype with
painted aces, dragons

754
01:02:04,835 --> 01:02:07,600
and other voodoo stuff
is aimed at them.

755
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,665
This is a psychological attack.

756
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,400
You scare the enemy before battle,
you get an advantage.

757
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:16,400
They won't scare him!

758
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,600
- Your regiment has many new boys.
- That's right.

759
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,800
So your task of the first
order, Captain,

760
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,465
is to explain all that to them

761
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,400
intelligently, setting your own example.

762
01:02:30,435 --> 01:02:32,665
I understand, Major.

763
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,700
I have my own account
to settle with the diamonds.

764
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,300
Just write like this? "This'll be
the day for you and us, so kiss my...

765
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,965
Shall I put an ellipsis?

766
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
- A diplomatic note.
- Cossacks writing to the sultan.

767
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,365
Ready!

768
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,400
- Grasshopper, translate it to German.
- Yes!

769
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,100
Do it quickly, but make it
sound like belle-lettres.

770
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,165
Ready.

771
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,200
- Is that all?
- The rest is untranslatable.

772
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,165
don't drag it out, or you'll get it
coming.

773
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,200
Come out to fight one on one, we
won't shoot you on a takeoff. Maestro.

774
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,765
And it took us a whole day to write.

775
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,800
A stylist. Not funny, but to the point.
You'll be an editor after the war.

776
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,500
And a flyer during the war.
Commander, allow me to fly.

777
01:03:28,535 --> 01:03:30,800
we'll talk later.
The letter goes in there.

778
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:32,667
They'll translate this themselves.

779
01:03:32,702 --> 01:03:34,500
- Will all the squadron fly?
- No.

780
01:03:34,535 --> 01:03:36,465
Will you fly yourself?

781
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,500
My number 2 will be
senior lieutenant Skvortsov.

782
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,600
Yes!

783
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,900
Yes!

784
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,700
Seryoga, they took the challenge.
don't fall back, come in from the sun.

785
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,200
Yes!

786
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,100
- Seryoga, my gun's jammed!
- What do we do?

787
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:12,400
Imitate an attack.
Cover me, I'll attack!

788
01:04:12,435 --> 01:04:14,065
Got you, Lyosha!

789
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,100
What chivalry!
Get the second squadron up.

790
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Lyosha, a Messer at your tail.

791
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,900
Hold on, Lyosha!

792
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,465
You're on fire, diamond!

793
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,100
Ninth, pull back,
your boys are in the air.

794
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,165
Roger, Pop.

795
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,065
Go away, Lyosha!

796
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,165
Let's sing a duet now, Seryoga!

797
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,100
- But your gun!..
- It's all right, I just kidded you.

798
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,200
I'll show you pedagogy!

799
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,100
Commander, are you all right?

800
01:05:32,135 --> 01:05:34,265
Give me the paint.

801
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,300
- What paint?
- To paint stars.

802
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,265
I'll get it in a jiffy!

803
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,300
Oh, you...
You ought to have your own paint!

804
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,800
How many stars? Two?

805
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,865
I'm running!

806
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,900
Two... You sweat so much
downing just one.

807
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,300
I stuck to him
and he writhed like on a griddle.

808
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Suddenly, from behind...

809
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,900
- I hardly managed to get out of it.
- Want to live, try to be smart.

810
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,800
Yeah, we taught those diamonds
a good lesson.

811
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,700
Well, this suit suits me alright.

812
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,100
What do you say, Romeo?

813
01:06:19,135 --> 01:06:21,065
- Me?
- Yes, you.

814
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,100
I saw the fight. I saw everything.

815
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,700
- Crosses, crosses, crosses...
- Did you fire?

816
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,900
Sure, all the cartridges.
And all missing.

817
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,200
Missing.
What is Juliet going to say?

818
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Commander, the women's
regiment will be based here.

819
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,900
The second squadron has been
invited to a party tonight.

820
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,665
Stop being cheap.

821
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,700
Go, go. She's been looking for you.

822
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,500
Comrade Commander,
may I go for a minute?

823
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,365
And right away the enamored mate

824
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,400
revved up his plane
and rushed on to a date.

825
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,200
- Commander.
- Quiet.

826
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,065
The cranes.

827
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,700
It's too early for them.

828
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:23,665
They're alive.

829
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,700
- Listen, Lyosha...
- Seryoga.

830
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,200
No words, please.

831
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,900
Yes, no words, Commander.

832
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,565
- The Messers!
- The Junkerses!

833
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,600
The enemy approaching!
Where're you going, kid? Follow me!

834
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,300
To the forest!

835
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,150
Where are you going?

836
01:07:54,185 --> 01:07:55,765
Get down, Grasshopper!

837
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,800
They'll kill you, kid!
Come back!

838
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:02,100
- Start'er up!
- Yes, start'er up!

839
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
he's crazy.

840
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
He took off! Grasshopper took off!

841
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,400
- Who took off?
- Titarenko!

842
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,900
- Start'er up!
- Yes, start'er up!

843
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,400
It's something, guys!
Grasshopper's shot down a Messer.

844
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,800
What a devil!
Let's lift him up, guys!

845
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,200
My dear boy!

846
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,800
No ovations, please.

847
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,800
Guys, Grasshopper's coming.

848
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,965
Right face!

849
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Attention! Center dress!

850
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,100
By the way, where's my vodka
ration for the downed plane?

851
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Why just a ration, my dear? You
deserve a barrel of Georgian chacha!

852
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,465
Cool it.

853
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,500
I don't drink,
but it's a matter of principle.

854
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,900
Way to go! Thanks, you've saved
the regiment!

855
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,065
And how he hit him!

856
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,100
Why are you laughing? Learn from him!

857
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,300
What a style!
Against all laws of physics!

858
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,665
Listen, it wasn't me.

859
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,265
Shut up.
Prepare a report for a decoration.

860
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,300
Not for me. For Lieutenant Grasshopper...
It's Alexandrov who shot him down.

861
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,365
- Grasshopper?
- Exactly.

862
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,200
- You're kidding me.
- No. He did.

863
01:10:50,235 --> 01:10:51,900
- You shot him down?
- Yes.

864
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I could shoot down more,
but you, Comrade Commander...

865
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,800
scared off all Germans
with your underwear.

866
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,800
Oh, those kids!

867
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,465
May we come in?

868
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,165
I got on his tail...

869
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,900
The getters are already here.

870
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,000
Good evening.

871
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,600
- Gifts of the forest.
- For our girls-in-arms.

872
01:11:40,635 --> 01:11:42,900
- You got settled all right?
- All right.

873
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:45,465
For this they
could go to the can.

874
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,500
They stole the birch-tree twigs
the sergeant had provided for the bath.

875
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,400
don't think ill of them.

876
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,500
They're nice boys, but somewhat
underdeveloped aesthetically...

877
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,500
Zoya, who are these boys? I think
they're not from our neighborhood.

878
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,400
- They're not even from our street.
- That's right.

879
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,800
Quiet, comrades!
Please, be quiet.

880
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,100
Our lecturer, Grasshopper,
asks for two more minutes.

881
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,800
If he goes beyond the time-limit, we'll
turn him out of the tent. Go on.

882
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,400
I'm speaking about love.

883
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:31,000
Seriously, I'm not kidding.

884
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,700
You see... people...

885
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Humankind should
come to understand

886
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
that hatred is destructive.

887
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,300
Only love is creative.

888
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,000
Only love.

889
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,100
Yes, love...

890
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,600
Seryoga and I have gone all the way
from Brest to Stalingrad with love.

891
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,300
And from Stalingrad to the Dnieper
here, also with love.

892
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,100
Even a hundred years later, I'll be
able to fly this route without a map.

893
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,700
Because all along there are graves
of the boys from our singing squadron.

894
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,600
And not just a squadron, a whole
division have fallen there.

895
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And how many more...

896
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,165
Some day in Berlin,

897
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,200
on the tallest
surviving wall,

898
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,200
I shall write lovingly:

899
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:41,100
"Satisfied with
the Reichstag ruins. "

900
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,300
And then I can go home, even if
I'll have to spray the gardens.

901
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,800
Commander, while leaving
your autographs in Berlin,

902
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,100
please,
pay attention

903
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,700
to our signatures,
those of the first squadron.

904
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,700
What difference does it make,
friend, yours or ours.

905
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Actually, the first to sign there
will be infantry private Vanya.

906
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,650
And it's only right.

907
01:14:11,685 --> 01:14:14,000
That's how it is.

908
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,565
Commander.

909
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,600
Everything passes, only music remains.

910
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,350
we'll live on.

911
01:14:24,385 --> 01:14:27,100
Start'er up!

912
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Listen, shall we ever hear

913
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,800
the best soloist
of the First Ukrainian?

914
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,900
The future soloist of the Bolshoi
Theatre?

915
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:39,900
No problem!

916
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,400
Seryoga, jump!
Jump, Seryoga!

917
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:13,400
We'll live on, guys!

918
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,300
The regiment is to be lined up in
15 minutes! Forward march!

919
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,100
Vano, they're just kids,
but you're an old man. How come?

920
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,300
- Sorry.
- What's the score, anyway?

921
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,700
- The second squadron was winning.
- Good.

922
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,300
May I address you
on a personal matter?

923
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:21,300
Be quick. What is it?

924
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,800
- I want to get married. May I?
- Yes.

925
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,465
Yes...

926
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,500
A great idea.
And just the right time.

927
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,100
I know what you're going to say.
It's war, they may shoot you down.

928
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,300
- They may.
- But they may shoot her down, too.

929
01:17:42,335 --> 01:17:45,300
- They may.
- So please, allow me to.

930
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,500
But remember, Romeo...

931
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,400
It should be
for life,

932
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,500
a short or a long one, but...

933
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,600
Will you ever get yourself a map case,
or shall I give you one?

934
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:03,600
- In battle, a boot is more reliable.
- That's in battle...

935
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,300
don't forget to invite me to your
wedding.

936
01:18:12,335 --> 01:18:14,265
- What?
- "Thanks" in Uzbek.

937
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,500
- (speaks in Ukrainian)
- Pardon?

938
01:18:16,535 --> 01:18:18,700
"You're welcome" in Ukrainian.

939
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:21,700
Wait!

940
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,600
Stand there.

941
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,900
You softy.

942
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,100
We've waited for this moment for
a long time.

943
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,200
We've waited for a thousand days
and nights.

944
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Comrades-in-arms! Pilots of the Guard!

945
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,365
Our ground forces are coming out

946
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,400
onto the borders of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics!

947
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,100
Our regiment has got
a mission to carry out...

948
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,200
Your boy is a real eagle. As if he's
commanded a regiment all his life.

949
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,800
From now on, the whole
regiment will be singing.

950
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,700
And if he gets a division,
where shall we get so many balalaikas?

951
01:19:09,735 --> 01:19:12,265
No talking while in line!

952
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:15,100
The enemy won't
give up the sky to us.

953
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,200
Our goal is to throw them
out of there!

954
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,365
It'll be a fierce fight.

955
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,400
Only "old men" go
to battle today.

956
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,765
Onto your horses, boys!

957
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,665
- What about us?
- No talking.

958
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,700
Don't be in a hurry, boys.
You'll get your share of fighting.

959
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,900
Those kids... You know
what's the most difficult in our work?

960
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,200
Rummaging in the engine at -30°.

961
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:29,900
The most difficult part
is waiting.

962
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,500
That's some way to land.

963
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Some "old men", my ass.

964
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,400
- Romeo, hold on the machine.
- I can't see anything.

965
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:48,400
Hold on the machine!

966
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:52,700
All right, we're landing.
Reduce speed. Reduce speed.

967
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,500
I can't see anything, Commander.

968
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,600
Stay cool, Romeo. we'll land.
Pull the handle.

969
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Get ready, we're landing. Switch off
the ignition. Good work, boy!

970
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,800
Break the door!
Doctor!

971
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,000
Step back, everybody!

972
01:21:26,035 --> 01:21:29,000
What?

973
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,200
I've landed, Commander.

974
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,265
Makarych.

975
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,300
You go and tell Masha.

976
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,465
Yeah...

977
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,500
The girls, regiment is gone.

978
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:28,765
Perhaps it's as well?

979
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,800
Romeo's still alive for her.

980
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,300
Commander!

981
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:40,700
Commander.

982
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,500
When the war is over,

983
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,400
we'll come back here,

984
01:24:13,435 --> 01:24:16,200
walk over these places...

985
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,500
those who survive.

986
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,800
And we'll have the best
symphony orchestra, all in tails.

987
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,500
The conductor will come out.

988
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,600
I'll approach him and say...

989
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,400
Let them play for us...

990
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,700
Well, you know... I'll do it.

991
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,300
I'll say: "Excuse me, Maestro.

992
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,300
Let me do it. "

993
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,500
And we'll sing "The Darkie"!

994
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,700
From the very beginning to the end.

995
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,500
And the grass of the steppe smells of
bitterness,

996
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
The young winds so green evermore.

997
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:17,300
We wake up in the night
to the thunderbolts

998
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:24,300
Either of a storm or the echo of
our past war...

999
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,500
I'll get up before the dawn and go
walking

1000
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Over a wide field as the day gathers.

1001
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,300
So strange my memory is working:

1002
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,800
I remember what has happened to
others.

1003
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,700
Drops of rain beating the cheeks
weathered;

1004
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,600
Twenty years for the world is little,
rather.

1005
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I have never known the boy who
promised:

1006
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,200
"Wait for me, I shall return, Mother... "

1007
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,100
And the grass of the steppe smells of
bitterness,

1008
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,900
The young winds so green evermore...
