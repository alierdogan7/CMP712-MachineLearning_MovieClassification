When the Taliban was in power,

they enforced their version of sharia.

617
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,051
One of their edicts was a rule that all
men must shave the hair of their pubis.

618
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,900
They would walk the streets
carrying a small wooden rod,

619
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,660
a dowel,

620
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,020
which they would roll
along the front of a man's trousers.

621
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,364
If a man's pubic hair was long enough
to curl around the dowel,

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,723
they would beat him.

they're flying you first class.

1730
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,020
Geri doesn't like me that much.
But she does like me now,

1731
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,361
so while I have this juice,

1732
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,164
I've got to leverage it
into something better.

1733
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,500
(SNAPS FINGERS) Yes!

1734
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,860
Yes, wait, Iraq.

1735
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,580
- I'll come with you.
- (LAUGHS)

1736
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:33,460
No, actually, Pakistan.
That's where the real shooting shit is.

1737
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,780
It's like the Wild West out there.

1738
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,740
Actually, I told Geri
that I want New York or D.C.

1739
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,205
(LAUGHING)

1740
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,280
No, I did.

1741
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,940
No, really, where are you going?

1742
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,451
New York or D.C.

1743
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,681
Why?

1744
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,009
You can still come with me.

1745
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,460
Because I think
there's plenty of good work

1746
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,980
to be done in the real world,

1747
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,128
and the Kabubble is well-established.

1748
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,820
Is this about me going
to Badakhshan without you?

1749
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,460
'Cause you would have done
exactly the same thing.

1750
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,767
- And, hey, what, I forgive you!
- (KIM SCOFFS)

1751
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,204
This is not about you.

1752
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,940
It's not about Badakhshan, or Glasgow,

1753
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,963
or the cottage with the chickens.

1754
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,206
What chickens?

1755
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,129
It's okay. I know you're not gonna come.

1756
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,363
I just have to get out of here
before it's too late.

1757
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,365
What do you mean?

1758
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,602
I started to feel like this was normal.

1759
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,523
You know it's not, right?

1760
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,490
Come to New York and get it.

1761
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,604
Remember, you're like a six in Manhattan.

1762
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:40,611
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1763
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,205
How's your baby?

1764
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,200
Which one?

1765
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,723
- You have two?
- Yes.

1766
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,723
- Irish twins.
- (LAUGHS)

1767
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:04,260
No, they are very good.

1768
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,125
The younger one, the boy,
he's very strong.

1769
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,520
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1770
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,860
I bet the girl is strong, too.

1771
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,325
She's stronger.

1772
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,330
So, um,

1773
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,321
those men in the hospital, the addicts...

1774
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,060
Any of them ever get better?

1775
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,845
Have a happy ending?

1776
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,444
In my culture, we would hug. (CHUCKLES)

1777
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,321
(GRUNTS)

1778
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,361
Hey.

1779
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,443
COUGHLIN: You know, I miss it. The Stan.

1780
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,420
KIM: Yeah, I miss it, too.

1781
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,602
Actually, I tried to go back

1782
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,290
but even the Army wouldn't take me.

1783
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,980
I mean, the Army!
I mean, that's just hurtful.

1784
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,081
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1785
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:54,020
Well, I'm very sorry
for what happened to you.

1786
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,940
So if there's anything
that you want to say to me,

1787
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,041
that's why I'm here.

1788
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,050
That's why I came here.

1789
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:01,487
Ma'am,

1790
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,807
I lost my legs because of an IED,
not because of you.

1791
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,220
I appreciate that,
but if I hadn't quoted you,

1792
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,641
- you wouldn't have been transferred.
- (LAUGHS)

1793
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,500
No, really, you can say
whatever you want to me.

1794
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,620
That's why I'm here.

1795
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,020
Okay, well, then let's say you're right.

1796
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,201
It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.

1797
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,820
Some 12-year-old haji
had to plant that bomb.

1798
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,700
And, hell, you know,
if Bin Laden's parents

1799
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,060
hadn't have gotten divorced,

1800
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:31,084
maybe none of us would've been
in the Stan to begin with.

1801
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,540
And the Taliban, they wouldn't
have even been there for UBL

1802
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,260
if Brezhnev hadn't have gone
and fouled up Afghanistan

1803
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,850
in the first place.

1804
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,340
And the British Empire. Yeah.

1805
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,580
And Kim Baker.

1806
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,170
Okay, I deserve that.

1807
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,700
(STAMMERS) Goddamn! Once you got no legs,

1808
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,643
everyone takes everything so serious.

(COUGHLIN SCOFFS)

1810
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,800
I mean, there's only so much
any of us have any control of,

1811
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,100
good or bad.

1812
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,340
If you didn't learn that in Afghanistan,
you were not paying attention.

1813
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,660
So, you're not gonna yell at me?

1814
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,081
(CHUCKLING) I mean, ma'am...

1815
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,644
Kim, you've got to move on.

1816
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,202
You're giving yourself
way too much credit.

1817
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,883
You embrace the suck,

1818
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,042
you move the fuck forward.

1819
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,401
What other fucking choice do we have?

01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,571
ELENA: Do I hear swearing over there?

1821
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,980
How are you standing there
the one time I curse?

1822
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,100
- "One time."
- I mean...

- long run in the military.

01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:46,980
So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?

1827
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:48,844
Of course she will.

- Say bye to Kim. Bye, Kim!
- Say bye.

KIM: Colonel, the Afghan
National Army missed

1832
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,180
yet another benchmark for preparedness.

1833
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,300
How do you think that will
affect our draw down in the region?

1834
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,700
There needs to be a revision to the
previously announced draw down

1835
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,820
or our future exit strategy.

1836
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:47,921
Thank you, Colonel Roberts.

1837
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,041

for those of us who cover it.

I'll be joined by award-winning

His new book, Conflict Zone,

1843
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,260
chronicles a decade spent working

1844
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,220
in the Middle East and Afghanistan.

1845
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,060

Hi, Iain.

Hi. Was I supposed to say something then

- when you introduced me?
- Nope.

1850
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:16,529
Nope. Just sit up, smile.

1851
