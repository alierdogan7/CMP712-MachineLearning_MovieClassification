00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:48,836
[Bells ring.]

00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:51,514
[Music.]

4
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:23,843
I told you
not to drink so much.

5
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,523
[She laughs.]

6
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,445
One dance, mister.

7
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,876
Just one dance!

8
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:49,362
Jacqueline, stop bothering
the gentleman.

9
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,364
- He's not nice!
- How about a drink?

10
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:08,399
It's blood!

11
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:11,525
It's blood!

12
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,404
[Music.]

13
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:06,925
[Spanish conversations from the hall.]

14
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,924
[Knocking.]

15
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,320
Come in.

16
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,920
Excuse-me.
It's the police.

17
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:41,356
[Speaks Spanish.]

18
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:53,124
The officer wants to see
your passport.

19
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,842
- What does he want?
- It's just a formality.

20
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,920
[Speaks Spanish.]

21
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:33,120
You must go to the station.
I said you'd go today.

22
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:34,361
Ah, yes. Si...

23
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,320
[Speaks Spanish.]

24
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:55,759
Thank you.

25
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Crime on Rue Saint-Vincent.

26
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,515
[Speaks Spanish.]

27
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:22,357
- This guy is repulsive!
- Scram!

28
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,841
- French?
- Yes, but quietly.

29
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:29,005
Countrymen, finally!
Can I buy you a drink?

30
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:34,595
We wouldn't say no,
but get rid of those two!

31
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:36,364
Go on, scram!

32
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:41,117
You're new. Like anywhere else, women
aren't the only ones on the game here.

33
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,442
- I'm Pierre.
- Siméon.

34
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,637
- And I'm Gorlier.
- Hello.

35
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:48,963
[Applause.]

36
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:01,919
- You're here on business?
- No. I just came from Berlin.

37
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:05,118
- Cigarette?
- Caporal! Great!

38
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:09,319
- You can find them in Germany?
- I bought them at the border.

39
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:11,437
You can trust us.
We're men.

40
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:13,796
I can see that!

41
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:16,035
Anisette!

42
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,918
- Same here.
- Make it three!

43
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,923
Word of advice: be careful
in Barcelona.

44
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:46,200
- It's full of snitches of every stripe.
- Really?

45
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:48,397
And you can't find a decent steak.

46
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:51,114
Oh, I'm used to it.
Berlin's even worse.

47
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:55,001
You don't know hunger until
you've lived in Barcelona.

48
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:59,677
- You can't let yourself slide here.
- Well, we'll see.

49
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:10,284
Say...

50
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:14,320
Do you know a place where
I can bed down for a while?

51
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:15,845
Why not here?

52
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:19,834
The manager is an ex-con.
His old lady does the cooking.

53
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,595
No danger of food poisoning.
That's very important in Spain.

54
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:26,965
- I'll go ask him.
- OK.

55
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:29,277
Go ahead.

56
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:35,286
- He's a good guy.
- Him? Oh...

57
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:58,394
Room and board:
220 pesetas a month.

58
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:02,036
Great.
I'll take care of it right away.

59
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,838
There's no hurry.

60
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,638
You have plenty of time.

61
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:11,044
Hey, you never know, mate.
This way, the deal is done.

62
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:15,922
What the hell did I do with my wallet?
... Wow!

63
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:19,714
You lost it?

64
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:22,526
Come on, give it back right now.

65
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:25,035
What do you mean?
What bad manners!

66
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:28,283
Skip the jive. I get it.
Give it back.

67
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:32,684
Be square. It's all the dough I have left.
And what about my papers?

68
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:36,276
- He's got some nerve!
- I've got nerve!? Let's step outside!

69
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:39,245
[Hubbub.]

70
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:42,483
[Speaks Spanish.]

71
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,724
Let's clear this up with the police.
Go get a cop.

72
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,518
What? No cops!
Never mind.

73
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,518
Take a seat!

74
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:56,563
You say you were robbed
and you're afraid of the police!

75
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,644
Okay, we'll meet again!

76
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:02,520
[Speaks Spanish.]

77
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,005
- He's going to...
- Throw me out if I don't pay for my room.

78
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:13,835
- You understand Spanish?
- Not, just the situation.

79
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:22,004
- How much can you pay?
- I haven't eaten in two days.

80
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:34,957
- He says... - That he's going to seize
my dirty shirts and my toothbrush.

81
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,283
Let him. I hope he makes
good use of them.

82
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Republic of Spain.
"...former Spanish and foreign soldiers to rejoin..."
Foreign Legion.

83
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,640
Not doing well?

84
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:09,675
- So you're hungry! Come and eat.
- No, what an idea!

85
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:12,002
Come this way.

86
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:54,161
[They laugh.]

87
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:57,956
Go on, eat! Eat!
Don't mind them.

88
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:28,165
Here, lick it!
Lick, you scum!

89
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,880
Here, you scum!
Lick it!

90
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,962
I'll kill anyone who comes close.

91
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Join the glorious Spanish Foreign Legion.
You will find in the grand setting of Morocco

92
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Honor and Profit -- 5 Pesetas a day.
No papers required. No forms to fill.

93
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,602
- You're French?
- Yes.

94
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:40,757
[Speaks Spanish.]
Why do you want to enlist?

95
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,957
- I'm famished.
- How's that?

96
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,000
- I'm hungry. I have no job.
- Ah yes.

97
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:56,556
[Speaks Spanish.]

98
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,845
- You're strong.
- I guess...

99
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,243
- What?
- Do you have your papers?

100
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:18,165
- No.
- It doesn't matter. Your name?

101
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,482
- Er... Benoît.
- Benoît.

102
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,484
[Speaks Spanish.]

103
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:26,405
- What?
- It's a popular name with the French.

104
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:31,316
- Would you mind another name?
- I don't care. Makes no difference.

105
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:32,641
Then?

106
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:36,634
Well, er... Write down Gilieth.
Pierre Gilieth.

107
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:40,475
G, I, L, I, E, T, H.

108
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:42,961
Sign here.

109
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,519
You're in.

110
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:56,963
[Speaks German.]

111
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,516
- Merde!
- You're French?

112
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:19,002
Mulot Marcel. Paris,
Rue 3 Frères. And you?

113
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,764
- Pierre Gilieth.
- Did they take you?

114
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:25,835
- Yes, I got the stamp from the vet.
- Me too. This is lousy.

115
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,162
- What's forcing you?
- I was starving.

116
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:32,757
Here, check out my shoes!
And they're called Oxfords!

117
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:37,642
Just three months ago, I was still a bagpiper
with the 3rd regiment in Algeria.

118
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,760
I've never liked soldiers.

119
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,685
One day, I got fed up
and I took a powder.

120
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:47,083
I made it to Spain, fat as a bicycle.

121
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,754
I really had to tighten my belt.

122
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:53,481
So we're going back to the desert.
And we're better paid on this side.

123
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,324
Yes, 5 pesetas.

124
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:59,959
And a pal.
So what was that German on about?

125
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,680
They probably turned him down.

126
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,356
You should see the girlie who came in after me.
They'll never let him near those 5 pesetas.

127
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:10,435
Oh, here he is!

128
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,045
[Speaks Spanish.]

129
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,476
- You have a smoke?
- I wish!

130
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:23,076
- If I may.
- Hey, another one!

131
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:24,719
- French?
- Yes.

132
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:26,435
Thank you.

133
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:31,156
- Here, thanks.
- No, keep it!

134
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,961
- No, what an idea!
- Keep it. We're here for five years.

135
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,077
- No kidding?
- They took you?

136
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:40,198
- As you can see!
- But your guns are kind of empty!

137
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:43,603
Don't worry about that.
We should celebrate!

138
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:47,401
- Maybe, but I'm flat broke.
- I have money.

139
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:52,077
What!? You have the means to drink and
smoke, and you join up like an idiot?

140
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,641
- I can explain.
- No questions asked.

141
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,346
The rule here is to
keep our memories to ourselves.

142
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,239
Right. We wipe the slate clean
and start over from scratch.

143
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:03,643
- You were a soldier?
- Yes, deserter.

144
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:08,317
- You desert...?
- Hey, come on, guys, how about this drink?

145
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:10,357
Let's go tie one on.

146
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,524
Hey you! Don't leave.

147
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:18,601
Here are your marching orders.
You take the boat in Algeciras.

148
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,761
Don't look, guys,
but here we go again.

149
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,763
I go through life backwards.

150
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:29,759
- Like a crawfish...
- Still, the important thing is to eat.

151
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:33,959
Yes, but after eight days of full meals,
we forget we've ever been hungry.

152
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,760
We'll see.
Back when I was in the colonial army...

153
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:40,078
Ah, you were in the colonial army?

154
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,316
- If you like.
- A broad?

155
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:46,001
You're wasting your time.

156
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:49,801
In the Legion, buddy,
you must always look forward.

157
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:52,440
A guy in the 4th regiment at Marrakech
gave me that advice.

158
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:58,004
His name was... Hey, his name was
the same as mine. What a coincidence!

159
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:05,523
What's this monastery?

160
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:09,116
That, my friends, is an image
you won't soon be forgetting.

161
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,964
It's the Legion camp

162
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,157
where you'll be living.

163
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,640
[Bugle.]

164
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:37,878
[Fanfare, singing.]

165
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:08,357
- It's got character.
- No talking in the ranks. Forward, left.

166
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,558
[Hubbub.]

167
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,441
- Do you have a preference?
- None.

168
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:08,557
- Then, take the corner.
- OK.

169
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:13,157
- Smells like spring in a garbage dump, no?
- Yeah, a rotten spring.

170
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,355
Oh, man!

171
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:18,320
We have a nice setup here.
Hey, fancy sheets!

172
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:22,201
- We could make you a veil.
- Well dressed, housed and fed...

173
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:26,081
- We only need a secretary to take a letter.
- It's still a strange way to live.

174
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:29,801
You, my little bourgeois, you'll be used
to it in one year, and you'll re-up in 5.

175
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,395
Listen to this soldier's advice,
and pass me a smoke.

176
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:40,403
[Speaks English.]

177
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:56,723
[Speaks Russian.]

178
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,803
Who the hell's this guy?

179
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:09,955
Hey, what...?

180
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:21,320
Do you have a stuffed nose,
or are just afraid of drafts?

181
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,562
The gentleman must think he's at the movies.

182
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:38,475
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

183
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:41,923
8, 9, 10... Out!

184
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:46,598
Bravo, mate, you're a real man!
Wait.

185
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:49,722
Let's put him over here.

186
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:53,077
- We'll take care of him.
- Allow me!

187
00:23:56,206 --> 00:24:00,597
- Goodnight, sweetie.
- [Speaks Spanish.]

188
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,603
[Hubbub.]

189
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:14,597
[A yell in Spanish.]

190
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,883
[Speaking Spanish.]

191
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:33,284
[Bugle.]

192
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:48,277
[Music.]

193
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,559
Come on, play another tune!

194
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:10,042
[Speaks Russian.]

195
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:16,234
The gentleman wants his nanny.
This is sure going to be fun.

196
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:20,234
My mattress is like an ironing board.

197
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,118
I don't like soldiers.

198
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:25,955
Oh, shut it.
This isn't so bad.

199
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:06,836
There. This is the Seine.
A real ribbon.

200
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:10,083
The Seine turns, comes and then
leaves again. But not right away.

201
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:13,596
She knows that when you're in Paris,
you have to stay as long as possible.

202
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:18,601
This is Montmartre. Streets that climb,
lovely girls, and accordion music...

203
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:22,515
And there, a kid by the name of Mulot.
Yours truly.

204
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:29,835
- A kiss to get by!
- Down with the paws!

205
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,640
- Give me a kiss.
- You disgust me! Hands off.

206
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:36,998
I know someone you don't put up
as much of a fuss with.

207
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:40,164
Is your dad coming back from his trip soon?

208
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,958
Will you introduce me then?

209
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,761
He's having his nap.
Just wait 'til he's here.

210
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,036
Ah, here comes your beau!

211
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:52,044
- Hi, guys!
- Hi.

212
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:54,316
- A drink?
- I'm broke.

213
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:55,720
No problem, I'm buying.

214
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,918
- Does your mother print money?
- Perhaps!

215
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:02,163
Oh, I almost left out Rue 3 Frères!

216
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,322
Hey, don't touch Montmartre,
you ruffian!

217
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:06,756
Do you realize not one of them
understands what you're saying?

218
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:10,175
I don't care.
They're impressed and I'm amused.

219
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,002
- You're a big kid!
- Come on, I'm buying a round.

220
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:15,356
So we're playing nice now!

221
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,842
- Whenever you keep your hands to yourself.
- He was hassling you again?

222
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:21,844
When you're born a pig,
you stay a pig.

223
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:24,321
- Let me know if he bothers you again.
- Oh, I'm not scared of him.

224
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:27,598
- Where's the wine?
- Cooling. The boss will serve you today.

225
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:29,842
Hurry it up, then!

226
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:32,514
[Speaks Spanish.]

227
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:39,918
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Greetings.

228
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:46,443
- Comes to 5 pesetas. Who's paying?
- "Who's paying?" I am.

229
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:51,242
Light of my life!
Show me you're not still mad at me!

230
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:53,555
No!

231
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:54,801
Leave it!

232
00:27:55,046 --> 00:27:56,604
I'm not trying to rip you off!

233
00:27:56,846 --> 00:28:00,077
- I told you not to touch it!
- What's the matter with him?

234
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,474
He's lost it!

235
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:11,044
It's love letters, letters from a woman.
I don't want anyone to touch them.

236
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:15,000
- I don't care about your woman.
- You know that the past is sacred.

237
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:16,195
Come on...

238
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:20,764
How would you like folks to rifle through
your papers, to dig into your past?

239
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:25,084
- I have no past.
- We all have a past.

240
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,596
- You, like everyone else. That's life.
- What?

241
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:32,640
- You want me to smash your face?
- Oh, come on!

242
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,845
Say, doesn't all his money
amaze you?

243
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:40,834
- It's his mother's.
- His mother, that's easy to say.

244
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:43,241
What about the fuss
he just made over his papers?

245
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:47,837
In the middle, there was an ID card
with a photo in the corner.

246
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:52,600
Oh, maybe it's just a driver's license.

247
00:28:52,806 --> 00:28:56,924
- In any case, it had a funny color.
- You only need to ask him about it.

248
00:28:57,126 --> 00:29:00,436
Then you just pound him into submission
if he puts up a fight.

249
00:29:00,646 --> 00:29:02,841
Oh no, it's not time yet.

250
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:06,834
I'd rather use a soft touch
to find out what he's hiding.

251
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:12,245
I don't want him looking into my business.
But if he insists, I'll set him straight.

252
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:16,644
Don't worry.
I'll wait for the right opportunity.

253
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:19,041
Time doesn't exist here.
So...

254
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:22,044
Still, I'd really like to know
what that card is.

255
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:27,195
He keeps his papers in his jacket
and his jacket on his bed...

256
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:55,197
Looking for something, Gilieth?

257
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:58,239
Oh, it's you! What...

258
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:02,598
- I got the wrong bed, sorry. I can't see.
- Sure...

259
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,322
Drills, forced marches...

260
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:26,922
That's all they have us doing.
Makes you want to check out of here.

261
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,923
Oh, you're always bellyaching.

262
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:32,323
I didn't sign up to play the fool.

263
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,604
[Orders in Spanish.]

264
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,960
[Fanfare.]

265
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:06,958
[Hubbub.]

266
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,877
I'm not going downstairs.
I'll just wait for chow time.

267
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:52,317
You're right. I'm bushed too.

268
00:32:57,566 --> 00:33:00,239
Oh, on second thought...

269
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:09,079
There. A trick I learned from my aunt.
Never fails.

270
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,300
Mysterious Crime on Rue Saint-Vincent
A man was found murdered in his home.
The motives remain unknown...

271
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,900
M. Morin's family has offered a reward
of 50,000 francs for information

272
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
leading to the capture of the murderer.

273
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:09,516
So, I hear you're headed south.

274
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:13,355
- You read that in the cards?
- The guy in the telegraph office told me.

275
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:18,560
The order came through this morning.
The 4th bandera is going to relieve the 2nd

276
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:22,554
- out of a nasty spot in the desert.
- I'm not affected. I'm in the 3rd.

277
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:25,803
- Lucky you.
- You think so?

278
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:30,761
I'd like to get out of here. The air
around here isn't good for my lungs.

279
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:46,160
- So, your feet don't hurt anymore?
- No, I must have bound them too tightly.

280
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:50,245
Come on, let's go down to the tavern.
The boss just got some first-rate wine!

281
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:53,040
- Get off my back.
- He also has real Pernod.

282
00:34:53,246 --> 00:34:56,556
- I said, get off my back.
- Hey, what have I done?

283
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:59,997
Don't be nasty. We're brothers.
We enlisted together.

284
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:02,766
Don't you remember the Barcelona barracks?

285
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:05,526
Or the first meal we had together?

286
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:08,559
We weren't proud then.

287
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:10,358
You're nagging me!

288
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:14,363
[Music.]

289
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,041
How do you like it?

290
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:52,401
- Oh, it's no Beaujolais.
- The third glass is always the best.

291
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:54,755
Here.

292
00:35:57,326 --> 00:36:00,159
Hey grease ball, shut it down.

293
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,516
You're going to make us bawl.

294
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:13,315
Oh, don't cry.
You'll rust the player.

295
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:18,554
They're bugging me with their flamenco,
their fandango and their cheap romance!

296
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:21,485
Gilieth! They have French records!

297
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:24,041
You're also being a pain
with your music.

298
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:28,558
- You must be reminded of bad moments.
- I'm reminded of nothing at all.

299
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:32,236
- Mind your own beeswax.
- Let's drink to that.

300
00:36:32,446 --> 00:36:35,040
I have something you're going to like.

301
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:39,285
Rosita, the old bottle.
Tell me what you think.

302
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:42,558
Painful memories need to be drowned.

303
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:45,963
Some of them know how to swim!

304
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:48,285
[Music.]

305
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:54,125
What's the idea?

306
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:57,563
- What's the matter with you?
- Stay out of it.

307
00:36:57,766 --> 00:37:02,044
Come on, don't worry.
We know what it's like to have the blues.

308
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:08,159
You remind me of a soldier
who came here because of...

309
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,756
Because of something stupid.
That was his secret. Get it?

310
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:16,164
He kept it deep inside,
but it ate away at him.

311
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,357
One morning, it weighed so heavily
on his mind

312
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:22,605
that he went straight to the police and
spilled his guts like an idiot. Get it?

313
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:27,639
- It was too much for one man to bear.
- Why are you telling me all this?

314
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:32,523
It's to remind you that
you must always trust your friends.

315
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:37,357
If that guy had talked to his friends,
he wouldn't have messed up.

316
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,797
What do I care about your story?

317
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,998
Don't get mad. It's just a story.
It's of no importance.

318
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:49,402
And I knew a guy who was always bugging
people with question after question.

319
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:53,599
And one day, he was found
with a knife stuck in his belly.

320
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:56,195
- You're saying this for my benefit?
- No.

321
00:37:56,406 --> 00:38:00,797
No, it's just a story.
It's of no importance.

322
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:34,364
Leave it.
He's over there, it's about to start...

323
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:36,318
He's being a real pain!

324
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:40,002
<i>Under Paris bridges</i>

325
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:43,482
<i>When night falls</i>

326
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:47,838
<i>All types of bums

327

328
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:52,721
I don't want to hear this!

It's just as good as anything else.
<i>You can't see clearly...</i>

330
00:38:56,726 --> 00:38:59,877
- I said, don't want to hear this!
- Oh, it's nothing.

331
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:02,202
Will you stop this?

332
00:39:03,686 --> 00:39:07,804
<i>To go to Suresnes</i>

00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:10,440
<i>Or to Charenton</i>

334
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:14,480
<i>All along the Seine
We walk...</i>

335
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,803
Shut up, or I'll deck you!

336
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:21,843
What's wrong with him?
He must be soft in the head!

337
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:28,883
[Hubbub.]

338
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:31,680
You planned this!

339
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,478
You're rotten!

340
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:37,235
I'll cut out your heart, you hear me?

341
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:40,358
[Hubbub.]

342
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:43,322
Get out of my way!

343
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:50,325
Clear out!

344
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:58,316
Where the hell is he?

345
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:01,878
Go on, scram!
I'll calm him down.

346
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:07,121
Go get some help at the camp.

347
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:13,359
- Gilieth, are you crazy?
- I can't stand that pig anymore! I can't!

348
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,721
So you're the famous Gilieth.
You asked to speak to me?

349
00:40:20,926 --> 00:40:23,520
- Yes sir, captain!
- What is it?

350
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:24,761
I'm not doing well, sir.

351
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:27,045
Explain yourself.

352
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,805
Sir, I no longer wish
to stay with the 3rd bandera.

353
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:34,396
There's a guy... er...
Sorry, an individual who...

354
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,996
Er... I don't know...
I think I'm a pretty good legionnaire.

355
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:40,401
I signed up to get some peace.
And I have the right to that pea...

356
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:44,076
You have the right to obey and to
maintain the discipline you chose to accept.

357
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:46,880
- I always do my duty, sir.
- I know. You're a good soldier.

358
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:49,520
Yesterday, I took care of
the guy who's been riding me.

359
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:53,605
- I know that, too. Is it serious?
- I'd trade my hide for his.

360
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:56,684
I don't like that kind of answer.

361
00:40:57,326 --> 00:40:59,965
You're beginning to annoy me
with these stories.

362
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,805
You don't get to choose your place here!

363
00:41:03,606 --> 00:41:06,359
You don't get to discuss your assignment.

364
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:09,524
Stop bothering me with your
personal interests.

365
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:13,765
Sir, please transfer me to the 4th bandera
so I can leave with them for the south.

366
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:15,604
It is the 3rd bandera, yours,
which is leaving.

367
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:17,205
Ah?

368
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:21,558
Well... Then I ask that legionnaire Lucas
be assigned to a different company.

369
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:22,755
Is that all?

370
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,441
You brawled yesterday
like a common porter.

371
00:41:27,646 --> 00:41:30,922
That does not incline me to grant favors
to legionnaires who get drunk,

372
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:33,765
who slaughter each other like pigs.
Like the pigs you all are

373
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:37,356
with your big mouths, and those damn pasts
I don't wish to know.

374
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:42,276
If we had to account for the pasts of
everyone in the Legion,

375
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:45,205
we'd be better off dissolving it.

376
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:49,957
Oh... We are not all born equal
before Fortune.

377
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,681
So if I have to die just to die,
I'd rather die

378
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:56,884
- with honor.
- How long have you known that saying?

379
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,321
Since I know that
I'm leaving for the south.

380
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:05,205
Legionnaire Lucas will be reassigned.
He will not leave.

381
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:09,001
May God grant you your wish.

382
00:42:09,206 --> 00:42:11,640
- Sir! Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.

383
00:42:11,846 --> 00:42:13,564
Listen, legionnaire!

384
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:24,836
When you feel your past
clutching you by the throat,

385
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:29,836
- ask He who can...
- I don't believe in God, sir.

386
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:31,035
Ah...

387
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:42,679
Then, here.

388
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,243
Thank you, sir.

389
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:13,757
Do you know what I'm thinking?

390
00:43:15,286 --> 00:43:17,561
Don't you care what I'm thinking?

391
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:19,677
I'll tell you anyway.

392
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:23,674
I'm thinking about crosswalks,
the crosswalks in the streets of Paris.

393
00:43:23,886 --> 00:43:27,879
Oh, I've never used one.
One must have some dignity!

394
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:31,874
Well, here, now,
they seem swell to me.

395
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:33,644
It's funny, no?

396
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,284
Are you mad at me because
I'm telling you about crosswalks?

397
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:40,080
No, buddy, I'm not mad at you.
On the contrary.

398
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:44,279
No, I feel good.
As good as it gets.

399
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:26,642
You can breathe easy.
Lucas won't be making you miserable.

400
00:44:27,406 --> 00:44:29,397
Why do you think Lucas
makes me miserable?

401
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:32,803
Only the blind can't see.

402
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:35,998
You're right.
Really, if I'm here...

403
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,198
- No questions asked.
- I have a serious reason.

404
00:44:39,406 --> 00:44:43,001
No questions asked.
You're my friend, and that's enough.

405
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:45,595
Oh, if you knew how it happened.

406
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:49,401
Don't bother.
You must have had your reasons.

407
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,404
Anyway, things will be nice and quiet
in the desert.

408
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,120
No more Fernando Lucas and
his smart ass mug.

409
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:58,756
- How long did you enlist for?
- 5 years.

410
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:03,681
You don't mess around, do you?

411
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:09,085
If you still have the heart for it,
you can join the military police after.

412
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,599
You look like two fools.

413
00:45:14,806 --> 00:45:18,765
- Yes, my little whore.
- It's true we look like two idiots.

414
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:24,404
But that's because we're thinking of
pleasant things that are funny only to us.

415
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:26,597
Yes, only to us.

416
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:35,199
- Here come the replacements.
- None too soon.

417
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:05,524
Welcome to the easy life.
No one will come looking for me here.

418
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:09,603
- So that's the famous road?
- Yes sir, captain.

419
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:13,196
The work is hard. It's pure granite.
We're making slow progress.

420
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:18,605
- Plus, we're getting shot at.
- Must be coming from that peak at 1200m.

421
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:22,719
That's right, sir. We're also getting it
from that crest.

422
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,996
We've done some scouting.

423
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:28,994
But the arms smugglers run away
whenever we get close.

424
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:33,757
This suburb seems packed with
comforts and luxuries.

425
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,156
They've stuffed our heads.

426
00:46:36,366 --> 00:46:39,563
Ultimately, we'll wind up building
more roads for tourists.

427
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:15,960
I'm fed up.
I'm a soldier, not a road contractor.

428
00:47:27,726 --> 00:47:31,719
My wife and daughter are playing tennis
even as we speak.

429
00:47:31,926 --> 00:47:35,202
- That's funny, no?
- I don't know, sir. I'm a bachelor.

430
00:47:35,446 --> 00:47:38,483
I'm not staying here
5 more minutes!

431
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:42,915
I'm fed up, captain!
I want out of here!

432
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,323
You'll give me 3 days
for presenting yourself

433
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:48,278
to your captain
without prior authorization.

434
00:47:48,486 --> 00:47:51,956
And 3 more days for having done so
in an unkempt state.

435
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:53,155
You're a dirty cow!

436
00:48:04,526 --> 00:48:05,515
- Tell me.
- What?

437
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:07,398
I checked with an old-timer.

438
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:10,518
Apparently in the village down the hill

439
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:13,320
- there's an establishment of
renowned delights. - Let's go.

440
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:16,676
[Arabian music.]

441
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:24,320
The boss, she's the tall one over there.

442
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,199
They call her "Breadboard."

443
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:32,921
She was bored in Europe.

444
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:34,957
Desert fever, in other words.

445
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,963
So she came back.

446
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:40,636
Not for the business.
She doesn't care about money.

447
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:43,243
In other words, an intellectual.

448
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:54,958
After the mule, God created the ass,
and after the ass, the legionnaire.

449
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,760
The birds do as they wish.
They're free.

450
00:48:57,966 --> 00:49:00,958
So you have to please them,
sweet-talk them.

451
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:03,157
With my mug, I don't get too lucky.

452
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:09,281
They're all Bedouins,
except for the tall blond in the back.

453
00:49:09,486 --> 00:49:12,364
She's German.

454
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:16,519
Oh, you only have eyes for the Pavlova.
Well, I have some inside dope.

455
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:19,559
She's from Rabat.
She had some problems.

456
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:21,836
Something about poisoned tea.

457
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:25,522
I'm telling you what I heard.

458
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:09,245
Oh, Princess...

459
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,955
- I'll make you some tea.
- Tea!

460
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:30,119
- It's nice here.
- Everything is mine.

461
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:32,442
I'll show you.
I have treasures.

462
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:37,242
- Where did you learn such good French?
- I used to dance in Meknes.

463
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:41,234
A lot of French legionnaires came to watch.
They were nice.

464
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:43,914
Then suddenly, for no reason,
they'd go crazy.

465
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:46,799
They'd yell at the top of their lungs:
"Get out of my face!"

466
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:51,079
- And they'd break everything.
- We call it the blues.

467
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:55,240
- You too, you get the blues?
- Sometimes, like everyone.

468
00:50:55,446 --> 00:50:57,596
And you'll break everything?

469
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:00,279
I don't think so.

470
00:51:02,246 --> 00:51:04,441
Come take a look. It's time.

471
00:51:07,646 --> 00:51:10,444
They're my friends.
When I'm sad,

472
00:51:10,646 --> 00:51:13,444
I sit down in front of my clock,
and I wait for them to come out.

473
00:51:13,646 --> 00:51:15,637
They never miss an appointment.

474
00:51:15,846 --> 00:51:17,837
Are you often sad?

475
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:21,235
Come!

476
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:29,956
- Do you want to hear the sea?
- The sea?

477
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:33,195
Listen!

478
00:51:37,246 --> 00:51:39,635
What do you use this compass for?

479
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:44,044
I use it to find the south. That way,
I can look towards my hometown.

480
00:51:44,246 --> 00:51:48,524
I also have necklaces, bracelets
and a gold coin.

481
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:57,160
I'll put them on

482
00:51:57,446 --> 00:51:59,801
so that you'll find me beautiful.

483
00:52:00,126 --> 00:52:02,082
But I find you beautiful.

484
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:05,677
When they found me pretty,

485
00:52:05,926 --> 00:52:10,204
- other men would kiss me right away.
- Would you like me to kiss you?

486
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:18,521
Listen. I think that when a man and
a woman like each other, the best thing...

487
00:52:18,726 --> 00:52:21,843
I know all of women's secrets.

488
00:52:22,046 --> 00:52:25,197
Yes, but you don't know how to wait.

489
00:52:28,046 --> 00:52:29,923
- Are these tattoos?
- No, it's henna.

490
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:32,924
- I've never wanted to be marked.
- Oh yeah?

491
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:38,120
I'll come with a friend. He'll mark down
my name on your shoulder with needles.

492
00:52:38,326 --> 00:52:43,116
- You move quickly.
- My name is Gilieth. Pierre Gilieth.

493
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:47,319
I am Aischa Slaoui.
My mother came from Rabat.

494
00:53:13,926 --> 00:53:18,556
No! He's having his face tattooed now?

495
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:25,119
It'll remove any temptation of going home
if I ever get the blues.

496
00:53:25,326 --> 00:53:27,715
I never want to see civilian scum again.

497
00:53:27,926 --> 00:53:29,917
Damn, what a snob!

498
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:32,879
[Whistle.]

499
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:03,322
Gilieth is getting married tonight,
and we're invited.

500
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:05,562
[Orders in Spanish.]

501
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,275
[Gunshots.]

502
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:10,478
[Music.]

503
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:18,721
Oh! Here she comes!

504
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:21,156
Here she comes!

505
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:39,321
Go ahead. Make the cross.

506
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:40,595
Go ahead.

507
00:56:47,726 --> 00:56:50,524
And so the blood of one mingles.
with the blood of the other.

508
00:56:50,726 --> 00:56:52,921
You have drunk from
the red spring of life.

509
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:56,641
May the sole God of my beliefs
protect you.

510
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:03,321
So that's it...? You're married?

511
00:57:03,526 --> 00:57:05,323
- May I?
- Yes.

512
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:09,155
[Fanfare.]

513
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:18,916
Finally, some real music.

514
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:21,594
Today, I'm buying.

515
00:57:31,566 --> 00:57:34,080
- Let's dance like we do in my country.
- I don't know how.

516
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:36,641
Doesn't matter. I'll teach you.
Come.

517
00:57:56,926 --> 00:58:01,681
First chance I get,
I'll shoot him dead, captain or not.

518
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:56,763
With or without mint,
tea is forbidden today.

519
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,116
If I drink this,
I'll see everything upside down.

520
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:02,921
- How about now?
- Go on, princess.

521
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,321
- Like it?
- Yes.

522
00:59:05,526 --> 00:59:06,845
[Screams.]

523
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:16,844
What is it? What's the matter?

524
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,201
Oh, that's too much, you bastard!

525
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:40,434
This neighborhood is prone
to frequent night attacks.

526
00:59:40,646 --> 00:59:43,035
You'll accompany me to the camp.

527
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,077
Here's my gun.

528
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:51,996
You'll walk behind me.

529
01:00:06,446 --> 01:00:09,483
[A voice sings.]

530
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:58,238
You'll do 15 days of labor for
bragging about killing your captain

531
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,563
and 15 more days for not having done it
when you had the chance.

532
01:01:01,766 --> 01:01:05,725
- A legionnaire cannot go back on his word.
- Yes, sir.

533
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:12,034
- Say, where are we going?
- To the mountains, this weekend.

534
01:01:12,246 --> 01:01:16,444
Apparently we're hooking up
with the 4th bandera.

535
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:20,036
They're camped out there,
and sparks are flying.

536
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:24,842
Never get taken prisoner. And always keep
a last bullet for yourself.

537
01:01:25,046 --> 01:01:27,435
If those bastards take you alive,
they cut off your head.

538
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:31,719
Then they give your body to their women
who cut you open to build a fire inside.

539
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,644
That's what they call central heating.

540
01:01:33,846 --> 01:01:37,441
I don't care. A fortune teller told me
I'd die of diabetes.

541
01:01:37,646 --> 01:01:40,160
- What time do we leave.
- 3 a.m.

542
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:43,318
Something's brewing.
Smells like a fight.

543
01:01:43,526 --> 01:01:46,802
It'll be good exercise.
We're starting to get fat.

544
01:01:47,006 --> 01:01:49,645
They're sending us on recon, and
reinforcements are supposed to turn up...

545
01:01:49,846 --> 01:01:52,155
[Singing.]

546
01:02:17,486 --> 01:02:21,718
- Now's a good time to make a will.
- You've got something to bequeath?

547
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:25,123
- All I have: my body, to medical science.
- What are they supposed to do with it?

548
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:27,521
They can study the illness
I suffer from in the throat.

549
01:02:27,726 --> 01:02:30,115
- What illness?
- I suffer from thirst.

550
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:33,523
- Sir, reinforcements have been spotted.
- Sound assembly.

551
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:34,954
Very well, sir.

552
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:38,603
[Bugle.]
Reinforcements are here!

553
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:40,717
[Speaks Spanish.]

554
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:50,517
- Say, Mulot.
- What?

555
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:53,718
You never know...
If I don't come back.

556
01:02:53,926 --> 01:02:57,123
Don't worry.
I'd take care of your wife.

557
01:02:57,926 --> 01:03:00,315
It's too bad we have to leave now.

558
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,802
I've never been happier or
more at peace than in this desert.

559
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:10,164
[Fanfare.]

560
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:04,724
I wonder what he's doing here.

561
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:07,520
I don't get it. The Captain
had bounced him from the company.

562
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:10,320
He must have managed somehow.

563
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:13,723
I'm not naturally curious,
but I'd give a year's pay

564
01:04:13,926 --> 01:04:17,919
to know what he's up to,
all the way out here.

565
01:04:19,046 --> 01:04:20,604
Here, look.

566
01:04:21,366 --> 01:04:24,836
Looks like he's already well-informed.
I bet you he's headed to "Breadboard's."

567
01:04:25,046 --> 01:04:27,924
And in a big hurry, too.

568
01:04:37,886 --> 01:04:40,116
I might as well find out.

569
01:04:40,326 --> 01:04:43,238
Things are turning sour, buddy,
they're turning sour.

570
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:45,716
- What's this?
- Tea.

571
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:48,918
No, not tea.
Give me an anisette.

572
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:51,959
Something strong.
Hey...

573
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:58,645
[Speaking Arabic.]

574
01:04:58,886 --> 01:05:02,481
- Is she your girlfriend?
- It's Aischa Slaoui.

575
01:05:02,686 --> 01:05:05,154
- Does she dance?
- For those she likes.

576
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:13,474
[Speaking Arabic.]

577
01:05:13,686 --> 01:05:15,404
Aischa, will you dance for me?

578
01:05:18,286 --> 01:05:20,322
I have money, you know.

579
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:34,317
- So?
- Aischa is tired.

580
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:52,755
Oh!, Oh, Gilieth!

581
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:56,963
I'm happy to see you, pal!
You too, Mulot.

582
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,555
This is great!
Leave the bottle!

583
01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:02,724
Tonight, we're having a party
and getting smashed.

584
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:05,360
- I was so bored without you.
- Oh yeah?

585
01:06:05,566 --> 01:06:07,955
Without you around,
life was just impossible.

586
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:12,364
And you, Mulot,
are you still as fond of soldiers?

587
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:16,445
- You, get off my back.
- Be nice. I've taken an interest in her.

588
01:06:16,646 --> 01:06:19,956
You know, Aischa,
Fernando Lucas is not Bedouin fluff.

589
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:22,555
Go on, dance.
Dance, girl, dance!

590
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:31,206
Don't you follow orders anymore?

591
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:33,477
Dance, since you're being asked!

592
01:06:47,806 --> 01:06:52,596
Dear lamb, all the blood of a soldier
isn't worth a single one of your tears.

593
01:06:53,006 --> 01:06:56,476
And you paid such a high price
for your wedding gown...

594
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:59,036
Peace be with you.

595
01:07:01,606 --> 01:07:03,881
[Music.]

596
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,076
[Speaks Arabic.]

597
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:09,050
I'll give you some of the powder
that was prepared for me

598
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,400
by the holy man of Sadi Aissa.
Pour it in your friend's tea.

599
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,900
And his heart will come back to you.

600
01:07:54,966 --> 01:07:56,365
Aischa...

601
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:20,402
How strange you people are!

602
01:08:20,606 --> 01:08:24,804
- I look in your eyes and I don't
understand. - I had to do what I did.

603
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:26,706
Listen to me carefully.

604
01:08:28,366 --> 01:08:31,597
Would you like to get back to the south
where you were born,

605
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:35,594
- and be with your parents, your friends?
- I have no friends where you aren't.

606
01:08:35,806 --> 01:08:40,004
We'd leave together,
both of us, you and I.

607
01:08:40,206 --> 01:08:44,802
I'd leave this uniform and dress like
those of your tribe.  Would you like that?

608
01:08:45,006 --> 01:08:45,995
Yes!

609
01:08:47,806 --> 01:08:51,196
I have 3,000 pesetas. My savings.

610
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:55,194
Everything I've earned in 3 years.
It's all yours.

611
01:08:55,406 --> 01:08:59,399
- We can afford to take a great big car.
- Yes.

612
01:08:59,606 --> 01:09:01,801
- Can I bring along all my treasures?
- Yes.

613
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:04,520
My clocks, my fabrics,
my belts.

614
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:06,603
Yes, but before then, you must...

615
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:10,003
- I'll do anything you want.
- Very well...

616
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:13,642
That man downstairs
is my greatest enemy.

617
01:09:13,846 --> 01:09:16,997
I knew it! I guessed it
the moment he saw you.

618
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:18,525
Then, listen...

619
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:23,801
Tomorrow, I leave for the mountains.
I'll be away for a few days.

620
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:27,396
During this time, Lucas,
that's his name, Lucas,

621
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:31,997
he must come back here.
And come back often.

622
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:34,197
Above all, don't tell him
that you're my wife.

623
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:38,797
On the contrary, make him believe that
you hate me, you think I'm a brute.

624
01:09:40,006 --> 01:09:41,405
Make him talk.

625
01:09:41,606 --> 01:09:46,475
And try to find out where he comes from,
and what he really thinks of me.

626
01:09:47,406 --> 01:09:49,124
And if he stays mum?

627
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:52,395
You'll be nice to him.

628
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,836
All he asks of you...

629
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:56,639
you will do.

630
01:09:57,926 --> 01:10:00,394
Sometimes you have to give a lot

631
01:10:00,606 --> 01:10:03,404
before a man loosens his tongue.

632
01:10:04,206 --> 01:10:08,245
But he must talk. You hear me?
He must!

633
01:10:14,206 --> 01:10:16,959
[Bugle.]

634
01:10:36,846 --> 01:10:40,395
- What time is it?
- My watch is 42 francs late.

635
01:10:40,606 --> 01:10:43,803
It's in hock. Wait.
It must be 5 o'clock.

636
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,681
5 o'clock.
That's when Fernando Lucas...

637
01:11:00,086 --> 01:11:03,044
Do you know Rue Saint-Vincent in Paris?

638
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:08,518
You don't know Rue Saint-Vincent?

639
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:13,324
At number 25, there's a little villa.

640
01:11:15,006 --> 01:11:18,157
That's where I killed a man.

641
01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:22,881
There's a reward of 50,000 bills
for whoever finds the killer.

642
01:11:23,806 --> 01:11:26,240
I'm sure that Lucas...

643
01:11:35,406 --> 01:11:39,194
As far as I can look back,
I've always been alone.

644
01:11:39,406 --> 01:11:40,885
So, when he came along...

645
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:44,635
Him or another,
what difference could it make?

646
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:49,916
But since, there are days when the shadow
of Gilieth blocks out the sun.

647
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,676
You're right.
Gilieth is extremely dangerous.

648
01:11:55,206 --> 01:11:56,878
But I know just the words

649
01:11:57,166 --> 01:12:00,363
to make him crawl into the ground.

650
01:12:01,206 --> 01:12:03,037
Do you know Europe?

651
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,122
I would like to know it.

652
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:12,160
If I go back there,
would you come join me?

653
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:16,484
I'm not rich, but
you won't be unhappy.

654
01:12:16,686 --> 01:12:19,598
My trade can become a profitable one.

655
01:12:19,806 --> 01:12:22,718
But you're a soldier.
Can you become a sergeant right away?

656
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:24,564
I can do better than that.

657
01:12:24,766 --> 01:12:27,883
I'm not a soldier like Gilieth.

658
01:12:29,006 --> 01:12:32,840
I may want to leave now, but when he
returns, I won't want to.

659
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:36,994
My will runs away in front of him
like water through a sieve.

660
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:39,879
If you help me, I will rid you of him.

661
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:43,795
- Forever?
- Forever.

662
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:45,758
Speak. I will obey.

663
01:12:46,806 --> 01:12:47,875
Listen...

664
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:51,284
When he returns, ask him:

665
01:12:51,486 --> 01:12:54,398
"What were you doing in Paris,
a year ago,

666
01:12:54,606 --> 01:12:57,803
"at dawn, Rue Saint-Vincent?"

667
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:02,003
- That's funny!
- What were you doing...

668
01:13:02,206 --> 01:13:05,835
What were you doing in Paris,
a year ago,

669
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:09,800
- at dawn...
- Rue... Rue Saint-Vincent.

670
01:13:10,006 --> 01:13:11,439
Rue Saint-Vincent.

671
01:13:22,806 --> 01:13:26,879
As you say those words, be sure to
look into his face carefully

672
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:31,796
and what he tells you,
you'll need to repeat word for word

673
01:13:32,006 --> 01:13:36,158
to someone...
And that will be the end.

674
01:13:37,286 --> 01:13:40,517
Are you a police chief?

675
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:43,319
So what?

676
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:58,716
I work faithfully for society.

677
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,840
I'll never dare to ask this of Gilieth.

678
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:05,482
You won't need to fear him
anymore.

679
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:07,764
You'll be free.

680
01:14:08,086 --> 01:14:11,158
I'll marry you
and I'll take you to my country.

681
01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:13,800
The men are coming back tomorrow.

682
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:15,200
Will you help me?

683
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:17,878
Force is on our side.

684
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:20,999
And tomorrow,
Gilieth will sleep in jail.

685
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:25,882
For now at least.
God will take care of the rest.

686
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,635
They've waited enough. They won't send
another dime. We must find a solution.

687
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:39,202
- And quickly. Lest you lose your position.
- My position!

688
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:43,081
They should come be in my position.
They'll see how easy it is.

689
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:47,879
Anyway, I'm close to my goal.
Take a look.

690
01:14:50,406 --> 01:14:52,715
He's going to "Breadboard's."

691
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:56,763
In a few minutes, I'll be set.

692
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:58,754
I'm going to know.

693
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:01,036
Ah finally, I'm going to know.

694
01:15:03,926 --> 01:15:05,518
"Ask him:

695
01:15:05,726 --> 01:15:08,559
'What were you doing, a year ago,

696
01:15:08,766 --> 01:15:12,315
'in Paris, at dawn, Rue...

697
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:13,961
'Rue...'"

698
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:17,638
- Rue Saint-Vincent.
- That's it!

699
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:23,194
- Do you want to know?
- I don't care.

700
01:15:23,406 --> 01:15:25,920
- You don't care that I killed a man?
- I don't care.

701
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:29,198
- Don't you want to know why?
- You must have had your reasons.

702
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:32,284
Peace be with you and with us.

703
01:15:36,526 --> 01:15:40,155
This won't be easy. It'll take a while.
Don't stray too far away.

704
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:52,759
Come, Mulot.

705
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,035
Here comes rat face!

706
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:04,594
So, did everything go okay?

707
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:05,955
May I?

708
01:16:06,326 --> 01:16:10,842
- Give me a drink.
- Don't bother sitting down.

709
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:13,482
We were waiting for you.

710
01:16:15,526 --> 01:16:18,120
Now that you're here,
we're going to step outside.

711
01:16:18,326 --> 01:16:21,159
I need to ask you
a few explanations.

712
01:16:21,366 --> 01:16:23,118
You can speak here.

713
01:16:23,326 --> 01:16:26,318
No! If you're a man,
you'll go outside with me.

714
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:29,756
Okay... okay...

715
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:34,724
Just be careful with your movements.

716
01:16:34,926 --> 01:16:36,439
We're being watched.

717
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:39,160
Say goodbye to Slaoui.

718
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:48,275
Come on, Aischa.
Say goodbye to the gentleman.

719
01:16:50,766 --> 01:16:51,994
I can't.

720
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:53,844
You can't?

721
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,715
Then spit in his face.

722
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:13,636
- Very nice, Aischa.
- Go on, walk in front.

723
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:16,076
And not one word
or I'll shoot you down.

724
01:17:16,726 --> 01:17:17,954
Ass.

725
01:17:26,846 --> 01:17:30,202
- Where are we going?
- Never mind. We'll be out of sight.

726
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:34,318
As long as you're alive,

727
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:38,155
always keep this coin
in memory of Aischa.

728
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:48,880
So you want to
cash in on the 50 grands?

729
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:51,805
50,000 bills,
that's a nice loot.

730
01:17:54,126 --> 01:17:57,721
Assuming I don't make you bleed
like a pig.

731
01:18:05,526 --> 01:18:09,041
I killed that guy
on Rue Saint-Vincent.

732
01:18:09,246 --> 01:18:10,725
I, Pierre Gilieth.

733
01:18:10,926 --> 01:18:14,919
The son of a bitch didn't deserve to live.
I executed him, you hear?

734
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:19,438
One less piece of garbage, trust me.
And I'd do it all over again.

735
01:18:20,126 --> 01:18:21,115
So what?

736
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:24,123
Get up.

737
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:25,839
You disgust me.

738
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:31,405
The ground is wet.
You might catch cold.

739
01:18:32,926 --> 01:18:35,520
I've often thought about you.

740
01:18:35,726 --> 01:18:40,277
I knew that one day
you'd show yourself to be a snitch.

741
01:18:40,486 --> 01:18:42,602
Well? What are you going to do?

742
01:18:43,926 --> 01:18:46,645
You'll sleep in jail tonight, Gilieth.

743
01:18:46,846 --> 01:18:49,440
That's interesting.

744
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:53,116
Don't you see what our lives
are like here?

745
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:56,079
Don't you get that men who made
this choice deserve to be left in peace.

746
01:18:56,286 --> 01:18:59,119
But that's not enough?
They still need cops on their tails!

747
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:03,524
To watch their binges, spy on their sleep,
stalk their loneliness!

748
01:19:03,726 --> 01:19:08,083
- You'll sleep in jail tonight.
- Is that what you thought?

749
01:19:10,326 --> 01:19:11,395
Oh!

750
01:19:12,726 --> 01:19:14,239
Here's your knife.

751
01:19:14,486 --> 01:19:17,080
You might need it.

752
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:24,244
Listen carefully.

753
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:26,323
My life is over now.

754
01:19:26,526 --> 01:19:31,316
I had been planning
to escape to the south with Slaoui.

755
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:35,758
But that plan's worthless now.
I'd be caught before I got there.

756
01:19:38,326 --> 01:19:39,645
And there's something else now.

757
01:19:40,326 --> 01:19:42,521
I won't end up like a louse.
You hear, copper?

758
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:48,916
With just one move,
I can wipe you out like an eraser.

759
01:19:49,126 --> 01:19:51,321
And then, I'm free.

760
01:19:51,526 --> 01:19:54,723
But I'm going to surprise you.
I'm not a murderer.

761
01:19:54,926 --> 01:19:58,885
I don't care about your hide.
I'm letting you go.

762
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:03,364
See that? If you talk,
there's one for you

763
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:08,805
and another for me. Now you can
go rat me out. Good day.

764
01:20:09,006 --> 01:20:14,126
[Bugle.]
What's happening?

765
01:20:14,326 --> 01:20:16,556
They're sounding assembly.

766
01:20:32,326 --> 01:20:35,716
Legionnaires,
you are men without country.

767
01:20:35,926 --> 01:20:39,316
You enlisted to serve Spain.
Now she needs you.

768
01:20:39,526 --> 01:20:40,925
She is asking you,
without holding back

769
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:44,522
to die for a cause she supports,

770
01:20:44,726 --> 01:20:48,002
in accordance with the contract
you chose to sign.

771
01:20:48,206 --> 01:20:49,241
Even at the moment

772
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:52,722
of your death, she owes you
no other explanation.

773
01:20:52,926 --> 01:20:55,042
An entire region is rebelling.

774
01:20:55,246 --> 01:20:59,239
We have a post in the mountains,
about 100 kms from here

775
01:20:59,446 --> 01:21:01,721
that can keep the enemy in check
for several days.

776
01:21:01,926 --> 01:21:05,839
Until we can organize our defenses,
I need 24 men to occupy this post.

777
01:21:06,086 --> 01:21:08,122
I have absolute right over you.

778
01:21:08,326 --> 01:21:10,556
And I can arbitrarily pick those men.

779
01:21:11,526 --> 01:21:15,485
But I want volunteers.
I want volunteers for death.

780
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:19,962
None of your comrades
have come back alive from this fort.

781
01:21:21,326 --> 01:21:24,363
I need 24 men to defend it.

782
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:27,160
Those who are ready to die,
step forward.

783
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:37,078
I myself will take command
of this detachment.

784
01:21:41,806 --> 01:21:44,366
There's no reward, this time.

785
01:21:50,486 --> 01:21:53,796
- Pick 24 men.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:21:54,006 --> 01:21:56,395
Gentlemen, I thank you.

787
01:21:57,406 --> 01:22:00,603
To the right, to the left,
the first 12 men, step forward.

788
01:22:02,606 --> 01:22:04,995
[Singing in Spanish.]

789
01:22:50,806 --> 01:22:53,001
Beef stew was on Wednesdays.

790
01:22:53,206 --> 01:22:55,401
She really had a way to make it!

791
01:22:55,606 --> 01:23:00,316
Some well-marbled beef and a calf's foot,
with some baby carrots.

792
01:23:00,526 --> 01:23:04,997
- And bits of bacon for flavor.
- Enough. You're making my belly hurt.

793
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:08,323
To think we joined up
because we were starving.

794
01:23:08,526 --> 01:23:09,925
This is taking us back.

795
01:23:12,006 --> 01:23:14,998
How about a game?
Just one!

796
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:22,841
A game of cards? A quick one.

797
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:28,084
Pay attention.
The captain is calling me.

798
01:23:42,406 --> 01:23:44,601
We should try to go outside

799
01:23:44,806 --> 01:23:48,401
to bury our dead comrades.

800
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,119
The air in here is unbearable.

801
01:23:50,326 --> 01:23:54,001
But that's impossible, sir. We're
under direct fire from the bastards.

802
01:23:54,206 --> 01:23:56,879
- But we could take off the roofing.
- If you wish.

803
01:23:58,886 --> 01:24:03,801
Take command of the post.
I don't have too much longer left.

804
01:24:04,006 --> 01:24:06,679
Yes, sir.
You, get rid of the ceiling.

805
01:24:34,006 --> 01:24:35,917
Oh no, the sun...

806
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:45,918
Oh!

807
01:24:47,006 --> 01:24:49,076
Oh the sun, dear God!

808
01:24:55,206 --> 01:24:56,719
Muller, where are you going?

809
01:25:00,006 --> 01:25:04,522
- I forbid you from going out.
- Captain...

810
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,360
- I'm going to get you some water.
- I forbid you...

811
01:25:14,406 --> 01:25:18,524
The water hole is under surveillance.
You know we can't get there.

812
01:25:19,606 --> 01:25:20,595
Muller!

813
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:22,918
[Shots.]

814
01:25:24,846 --> 01:25:26,325
[Gunshots.]

815
01:25:27,766 --> 01:25:29,085
The dirty cows!

816
01:26:02,006 --> 01:26:03,325
You know this is poisoned!

817
01:26:03,566 --> 01:26:05,284
Look at the guys!

818
01:26:14,206 --> 01:26:16,401
He's crazy!

819
01:26:19,606 --> 01:26:21,358
You're nuts!

820
01:26:21,806 --> 01:26:25,924
By God, no one is drinking
from this again!

821
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,565
[Hubbub.]

822
01:26:36,246 --> 01:26:38,362
Stop, stop!

823
01:26:39,446 --> 01:26:41,402
To your posts, immediately!

824
01:26:41,606 --> 01:26:43,801
Mulot! Mulot, to your post!

825
01:26:44,006 --> 01:26:46,201
To your post, I say!

826
01:26:46,406 --> 01:26:47,998
Mulot!

827
01:26:50,406 --> 01:26:54,399
Where the hell is that rescue column?
We're dying of hunger and thirst here!

828
01:26:54,606 --> 01:26:58,804
They were probably stopped. Maybe that
cannon we heard all night is responsible.

829
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:00,803
Isn't that what our planes are for?

830
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:02,724
[Sound of a plane engine.]

831
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:12,203
It's one of ours, guys!

832
01:27:12,406 --> 01:27:15,398
It's Lieutenant Garcia's squadron.

833
01:27:21,126 --> 01:27:23,401
[Gunshots.]

834
01:27:25,806 --> 01:27:29,355
He must have run into the bastards!
I'll show this pig!

835
01:27:33,326 --> 01:27:35,715
[Gunshots.]

836
01:27:48,566 --> 01:27:51,205
- He's coming back!
- Take cover!

837
01:27:51,406 --> 01:27:53,237
Lie down!
Play dead!

838
01:28:06,206 --> 01:28:08,117
Hurrah!

839
01:28:08,606 --> 01:28:10,403
Hurrah!

840
01:28:10,606 --> 01:28:12,198
Hurrah!

841
01:28:12,406 --> 01:28:13,395
[Shot.]

842
01:28:16,406 --> 01:28:18,795
This time, we're screwed.

843
01:28:19,006 --> 01:28:20,758
You're telling me!

844
01:28:23,766 --> 01:28:26,599
If I have to die,
I don't want to die of thirst.

845
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:30,003
- I'm going to get some water.
- Stay here!

846
01:28:30,206 --> 01:28:34,279
Don't worry. I've figured out how to get
there, and I'll be careful.

847
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:38,394
- Anyway, at the point where we are...
- Did you go nuts too?

848
01:28:39,406 --> 01:28:42,603
If I'm not back in three or four weeks,

849
01:28:42,806 --> 01:28:46,401
and one day you go by Place Blanche,
stop by the newsstand at the corner.

850
01:28:46,606 --> 01:28:49,803
Tell the guys that Mulot died
for a glass of water.

851
01:28:50,006 --> 01:28:53,442
I'd love to see
the look on their faces!

852
01:28:54,486 --> 01:28:55,475
[Shot.]

853
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,363
[Shots.]

854
01:29:03,006 --> 01:29:07,921
[Mulot singing.]

855
01:29:09,606 --> 01:29:10,800
Captain!

856
01:29:18,006 --> 01:29:20,998
So, you're with the police.

857
01:29:21,246 --> 01:29:22,804
Yes, sir.

858
01:29:24,606 --> 01:29:26,995
My enlistment is void.
I only signed up to...

859
01:29:27,206 --> 01:29:29,401
I don't want to know anything.

860
01:29:29,606 --> 01:29:31,801
If I had known your identity sooner,

861
01:29:32,006 --> 01:29:34,645
I would have drummed you out.

862
01:29:34,846 --> 01:29:37,599
People like you
have no business being with us.

863
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:41,003
Our men deserve to be forgotten.

864
01:29:41,206 --> 01:29:43,800
I volunteered to follow you here.

865
01:29:44,006 --> 01:29:48,796
If you get out alive,
you will leave this uniform,

866
01:29:49,006 --> 01:29:51,156
you will return to Europe...

867
01:29:51,646 --> 01:29:53,079
Yes, sir.

868
01:29:53,406 --> 01:29:55,397
And you will forget.

869
01:29:56,406 --> 01:29:59,239
- Did you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

870
01:30:00,606 --> 01:30:02,164
By your command, sir.

871
01:30:13,886 --> 01:30:14,875
[Shot.]

872
01:30:15,086 --> 01:30:17,884
Ow! Bastards!

873
01:30:19,006 --> 01:30:21,918
I don't care.
I'm not thirsty anymore...

874
01:30:25,806 --> 01:30:29,196
- Mulot is dead. I'm going to get him.
- They'll kill you too.

875
01:30:29,406 --> 01:30:32,398
Does that inconvenience you, copper?
You had other plans for me.

876
01:30:32,606 --> 01:30:34,801
But he's my friend! My friend!

877
01:30:35,006 --> 01:30:38,123
It's over, Gilieth.
You know it.

878
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:42,404
Ah... And if we get out of this?

879
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:45,325
You won't have to worry about me.

880
01:30:47,966 --> 01:30:50,275
Listen. The two of us came here together.

881
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:52,716
We don't care what
the world thinks of us.

882
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:56,555
But since we're going to die,
we mustn't die like pigs.

883
01:30:57,406 --> 01:30:58,475
Come on.

884
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,634
[Bugle.]

885
01:31:08,006 --> 01:31:10,566
- We're going to make it.
- Oh, Gilieth!

886
01:31:12,966 --> 01:31:15,321
[Gunshots.]

887
01:31:29,606 --> 01:31:32,678
- Life is beautiful!
- Oh, my God!

888
01:31:37,806 --> 01:31:40,001
What? Gilieth! Gilieth!

889
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:41,321
Gilieth!

890
01:31:41,606 --> 01:31:45,201
The replacements are here, mate!
They're here!

891
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:53,634
Captain!

892
01:31:54,606 --> 01:31:56,005
Captain!

893
01:32:53,686 --> 01:32:55,961
Present arms!

894
01:33:00,766 --> 01:33:04,805
The 1st company takes
roll call of the 4th bandera!

895
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,764
