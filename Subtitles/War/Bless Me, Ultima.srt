(SIGHS) He walked toward
a grove of cottonwood trees.

185

186
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,585
He'd been warned before
not to go there,

Yes, I will go.

206
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:19,263
But you must understand, that when
one tampers with the fate of a man,

207
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,701
a chain of events is set in
motion that no one can control.

01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,386
I'm dying.

886
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,726
I need confession.

887
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:31,656
I'm not a priest.
But you're pure of heart.

888
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:34,900
Confess me.

889
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,371
Come. Come.

890
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,552
ADULT ANTONIO: My father
went to the sheriff,

891
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:02,119
but he only had the word
of a small boy

892
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,100
as a witness against a man
of means and family name.

893
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,536
I wondered how God
could take such a man,

894
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,207
how he could let him sink
so quietly into the ground,

895
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,841
like the rain.

896
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,580
I wondered.

897
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,391
And in time,

898
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,691
no one remembered
anything good about Narciso.

899
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,236
Not long after, Andrew quit
his job at the grocery store.

900
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,310
And he dropped his plans
to finish high school,

901
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:55,214
to join Leon and Eugene
in Albuquerque.

902
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,309
(CHUCKLES) Thanks, Mom.

903
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,532
No one knew that
he had forsaken Narciso.

904
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,936
No one knew that he
couldn't face his shame.

905
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,942
GABRIEL: They've forsaken
their father.

906
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,848
My boys have left me.

907
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,812
It's my fault...

908
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,419
My fault.

909
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:42,863
I should have known that the Marez blood
in them would make them restless.

910
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:53,874
The same blood that set me
wandering when I was young.

911
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,037
Papa!

912
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,414

913
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,312
(SIGHING) Oh!

914
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:10,484
It's time for supper, eh?

915
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,795
You know,
we're all just wanderers,

916
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,086
adrift at sea.

917
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,233
It's in the name, Marez.

918
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,731
Perhaps the Luna blood
should win in the end.

919
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,834
It's more quiet, like the moon.

920
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,928
(WHISPERING) Go inside.

921
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,044

I'm so proud of you, Antonio.

928
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,727
Just think, when you take
your First Communion,

929
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,068
all your sins will be forgiven,

930
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,301
and you will be
at one with God.

931
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,102
Really?

932
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,944
I'll be one with God?

933
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,208
Yes.

934
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,377
He asked me how many people
is there in one God.

935
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:58,723
What'd you say?

936
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,801
Three, four...

I don't know!

938
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,161
What about you, Tony?

939
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,831
I had to recite
the Apostles' Creed

940
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:07,108
and tell what each part meant.

Bull!

943
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,345
Tony could do it
if he wanted to.

944
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,505
Tony's gonna be a priest!

945
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:13,639
I have an idea.

946
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,080
Why don't we all practice
going to confession

947
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,481
and make Tony the priest?

948
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,076
No, no.
Tony's the priest.

949
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,518
Yeah.
Tony's the priest.

950

Okay! Okay.
I'm the priest.

953
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,732
Do it right. Yeah,
do it for reals!

01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,100
You have sinned.
Yeah.

What are your sins? Tell
him your worst one.

I know! I know how to do it!
Yeah!

961
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,509
One day, when Miss Violet
let me go to the bathroom,

962
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,065
I made a hole in the wall
with a nail.

964
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:53,518
Then I could see
into the girls' bathroom.

Give him a penance!

967
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,555
Okay, for your penance,
say a rosary to the Virgin.

968
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:01,720
Florence next!

969
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,290
Nah, that's enough practice.

970
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,333
Florence needs the practice.

971
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,728
Yes. Why doesn't
he believe?

972
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:11,931
Stop it!

What are your sins?

975
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,308
I don't have any.

976
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:24,784
Yes, you do, you jerk!

977
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,081
Everybody has sins!

978
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,245
Just tell me one.

979
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,717
I don't have any!

Confess your sins or you'll go to Hell!
Yeah! Confess!

981
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,251
I haven't sinned!

982
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,022
God sinned against me.

983
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,064
Florence, don't say that.

984
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,690
Why?
It's the truth.

985
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,394
Why did he take
my parents from me?

986
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,169
Why did he take Narciso?

987
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,864
What harm did Narciso ever do?

988
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:45,437
We shouldn't
even listen to him.

989
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:46,633
He shouldn't even be here.

990
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:47,935
Give him a penance.

991
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,170
Make his penance hard!

992
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:51,041
No! There'll be
no punishment!

01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,637
His sins are forgiven!

you have to!

absolved him of his sins.

We don't want
you for our priest!

998

Punish the priest.

No.

1005
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,072
I can't.

1006
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:23,468
I can't.

01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:26,475

I'm trying to remember
all the sins

I've ever committed.

1011
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,442
Please forgive me for them.

Please forgive me.

Please forgive me.

Did he harm you in any way?

No.

1016
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,685
Did he leave anything
by the tree, hmm?

1017
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,485
Anything you might have
touched, or picked up?

1018
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,121
No, but...

(SIGHING) The day
he killed Narciso,

1020
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,855
he swore he would kill you.

1021
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,667
Don't worry about Tenorio.

1022
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,595
He's just an old wolf

1023
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,869
who drags around the ground
where he made his kill.

1024
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,174
His conscience
will not let him sleep.

1025
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:06,140
But where there is no penance,

1026
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,943
there can be no forgiveness.

I was one with God,

1048
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:13,966
I would ask him why Tenorio
was alive instead of Narciso?

1049
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,773
Why he had allowed evil
to happen?

1050
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,781
Why it went unpunished?

1051
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,147
I called out to him
that now was a part of me.

1052

01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:14,330
And no road was too long for her
to travel to ease someone's pain,

or to lift a curse,
or cool a fever.

1064
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:19,966
But often when
their miseries passed,

1065
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,305
they shunned her just the same.

1066
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,021

Was he wandering in purgatory?

Would he burn forever in Hell?

1106
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,915
I wondered if God was angry

Ay, mijo, you have
so many questions.

01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:31,949
Didn't the priest
talk about it in church?

Oh... Oh, okay, well...

In that case, I'll
tell you how I see it.

1130
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:48,694
I think most of the things we
call evil, aren't evil at all.

1131
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,568
It's just that we don't
understand what they are,

1132
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:53,038
so we call 'em evil.

1133
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,702

He got sick,

1134
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:59,178

1136
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,441
she understood what was wrong.

01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:05,845
But, I took the Holy Communion

1138
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,252

1139
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:11,616
Understanding doesn't
come that easy, Tony.

01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,558

Understanding comes with life.

1143
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:27,941
As a man grows,
he sees life and death.

1144
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,873
He's happy, he's sad, he works,

he plays, he meets people.

Sometimes it takes a whole
lifetime to acquire understanding.

But, mijo, in the end,

1148
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:53,161
understanding simply means to have
sympathy, sympathy for people, yeah?

1149
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:54,695
And Ultima...

1150
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,229
Ultima has sympathy for people.

1151
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,171
But with her, mijo,

1152
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:04,735
with her it's so complete that she
can touch their souls and cure them.

I worked alongside my uncles.

1158
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:33,363
I watched the care and the respect
they showed the earth and the plants.

1159
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:38,342
Only Ultima showed such reverence
for the land and its offerings.

1160
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:43,342
I learned that the phases of the
moon not only ruled the planting,

1161
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:46,213
but almost every part
of their lives.

1162
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,351
That's why they were Lunas.

1163
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:55,258
They would not gather plants or save next
year's seeds until the moon said so.

1164
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:02,365
I thought of my father too.

reached out somewhere.

01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:39,995
When I was a child,

1236
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:43,999
a wise old man gave me the owl

1237
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:48,903
as a... As a bond
to the time

1238
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:52,342
and harmony of the universe.

1239
01:35:57,251 --> 01:36:01,051
Evil men create disharmony

1240
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:06,257
that reaches out
and destroys life.

1241
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:13,161
But it passes away,

1242
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:16,527
it passes away.

1243
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:24,173
Gather my medicines,

1244
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:31,106
and burn them
somewhere on the river.

1245
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:33,116
Everything.

1246
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:37,954
But take the owl now
into the hills,

1247
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,484
and bury it at a...

1248
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,665
At a forked juniper tree.

1249
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:49,060
Go...

1250
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:51,535
Go quickly.

1251
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:55,867
Bless me, Ultima.

1252
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:02,981
In the name of all that's good

1253
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:08,413
and strong and beautiful

1254
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,359
I bless you.

1255
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:19,991
Go.

1256
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:22,759
Go, quickly.

1257
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,396
Grande...

1258
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:05,342
(SNIFFLES)

1259
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,662
ADULT ANTONIO: My father
built a fine pine coffin,

1260
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:30,669
and people came from miles
around to mourn La Grande,

1261
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:33,738
her cures and her magic.

1262
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:38,138
But, I knew to look
beyond their sadness.

1263
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:43,009
Ultima taught us how to make
strength from our experiences.

1264
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:45,176
To hold wonder in our lives.

1265
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:50,551
She taught us that the eternal
soul expands by embracing life,

1266
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:54,116
and all that happens,
both good and evil.

1267
01:38:58,198 --> 01:38:59,859
No, I did not cry.

1268
01:39:01,068 --> 01:39:03,662
Her voice is everywhere.
