He was ignorant of the profound change
that had come over Tomainia.

Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation

- The working hours. The cut in wages.

Chiefly, the synthetic food...
the quality of the sawdust in the bread.

Burn down some of their houses.

life for the liberation of his people.

01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:26,299
I have been in continued communication
with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir.

1692
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,384
The route ahead of us is well-guarded.

1693
01:53:28,468 --> 01:53:32,138
And at the back of us are 200 tanks,
50 armored cars and 500 machine guns.

[Officer]
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...

1725
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:31,502
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.

1726
01:57:36,341 --> 01:57:38,384
"Corona veniet delectis."

1727
01:57:38,468 --> 01:57:40,678
"Victory shall come to the worthy."

1728
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:46,767
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

1729
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:49,562
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

1730
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:51,230
They stand in the way of action.

1731
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,232
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

1732
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:58,904
In the future, each man will serve the
interest of the state with absolute obedience.

1733
01:57:58,989 --> 01:58:01,031
Let him who refuses beware.

1734
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:05,494
The rights of citizenship will be taken
away from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

1735
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:08,914
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

1736
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:12,418
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1737
01:58:13,628 --> 01:58:16,672
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

1738
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:20,551
and the people of this nation will obey the
laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...

1739
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:26,098
the dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich...

1740
01:58:26,182 --> 01:58:30,060
the future emperor of the world.

1741
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:32,813
You must speak.

1742
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:35,274
I can't.

1743
01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:37,943
You must. It's our only hope.

1744
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:42,072
Hope.

1745
01:59:29,913 --> 01:59:31,497
I'm sorry...

1746
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:33,499
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1747
01:59:33,583 --> 01:59:35,668
That's not my business.

1748
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:38,253
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1749
01:59:38,338 --> 01:59:40,255
I should like to help everyone,
if possible...

1750
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:43,592
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1751
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:47,262
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1752
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:50,599
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1753
01:59:50,684 --> 01:59:53,102
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

1754
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:56,355
In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

1755
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:58,357
and can provide for everyone.

1756
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:01,485
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

1757
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:03,612
But we have lost the way.

1758
02:00:03,697 --> 02:00:06,240
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

1759
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:08,617
has barricaded the world with hate...

1760
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:11,620
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1761
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:15,082
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

1762
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:18,210
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

1763
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:22,214
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

1764
02:00:22,298 --> 02:00:25,134
We think too much and feel too little.

1765
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:27,803
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

1766
02:00:27,887 --> 02:00:31,473
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

1767
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:35,811
Without these qualities, life will
be violent, and all will be lost.

1768
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:38,605
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

1769
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:41,900
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

1770
02:00:41,985 --> 02:00:45,404
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1771
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:48,490
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

1772
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:51,785
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

1773
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:56,874
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

1774
02:00:56,958 --> 02:01:00,335
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1775
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:03,589
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

1776
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:07,426
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1777
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:10,804
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

1778
02:01:10,889 --> 02:01:14,433
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

1779
02:01:14,517 --> 02:01:18,312
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

1780
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:22,357
Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes...

1781
02:01:22,442 --> 02:01:26,111
men who despise you, enslave you,
who regiment your lives...

1782
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:28,447
tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel...

1783
02:01:28,531 --> 02:01:32,868
who drill you, diet you, treat you
like cattle, use you as cannon fodder!

1784
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:35,537
Don't give yourselves
to these unnatural men...

1785
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:39,208
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts!

1786
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:43,045
You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

1787
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:45,380
You have the love of humanity
in your hearts.

1788
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:47,800
You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.

1789
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:49,802
The unloved and the unnatural.

1790
02:01:49,886 --> 02:01:53,388
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery,
fight for liberty!

1791
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,516
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke
it is written...

1792
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,226
"The kingdom of God is within man."

1793
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:00,896
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men... in you!

1794
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:03,023
You the people have the power...

1795
02:02:03,107 --> 02:02:06,109
the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

1796
02:02:06,194 --> 02:02:09,738
You the people have the power
to make this life free and beautiful...

1797
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:12,074
to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1798
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,327
Then, in the name of democracy,
let us use that power!

1799
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:16,995
Let us all unite!

1800
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:20,499
Let us fight for a new world,
a decent world...

1801
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:22,334
that will give men a chance to work...

1802
02:02:22,418 --> 02:02:25,420
that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

1803
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:28,465
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

1804
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:32,427
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!

1805
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:36,265
Dictators free themselves,
but they enslave the people.

1806
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:39,434
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!

1807
02:02:39,519 --> 02:02:41,770
Let us fight to free the world...

1808
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:45,440
to do away with national barriers,
to do away with greed...

1809
02:02:45,525 --> 02:02:47,526
with hate and intolerance.

1810
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:52,197
Let us fight for a world of reason,
a world where science and progress...
