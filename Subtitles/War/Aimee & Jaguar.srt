1
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,201
That's nice.

2
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,304
I got him!
- Good!

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,433
Berlin has always been one of Europe's
most important cities ... a center.

4
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:12,072
And right here in these rooms you're in
the center of the center, so to speak.

5
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,344
Government buildings are so close, you
might meet the Chancellor for breakfast.

6
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:22,149
The radiance of the next millennium
streams through these very windows.

7
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,684
This way, please.

8
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:29,456
The wallpaper will be removed,
and the walls will be plastered.

9
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,293
Rudi, take your hands off that!

10
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,633
Rudi, where are you?

11
00:01:55,716 --> 00:02:00,487
The photos and the chair are mine.
You can burn the rest.

12
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,201
You've got all my things?
- Yes, don't worry, Mrs. Wust.

13
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,270
I'll be with you in a sec.

14
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,407
There you are.

15
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,822
Lovely skirt.

16
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,424
One last look?

17
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,236
You'll get used to it, Mrs. Wust.
Just get yourself settled,

18
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:55,275
and then come down and meet the others.
Do you like to play rummy?

19
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,213
Mrs. Wust?
Where is she? Mrs. Wust?

20
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:11,358
Where are you going, Mrs. Wust?
Be sensible.

21
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,195
Stay here!
- I gotta leave.
- Where are you going?

22
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,399
No, no, no!
- Stay here! Be sensible!
Where are you going?

23
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,202
Where are you going, Mrs. Wust?

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,961
Ilse?

25
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,974
Yes, well, I'm Ilse.

26
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:06,013
In November, 1943, my girlfriend Felice
and I went to hear Beethoven's Ninth.

27
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:10,551
The Berlin air battle was in its 3rd week,
but life's full of contradictions.

28
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,320
War didn't interest me at all
that evening.

29
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,491
All I had on my mind
were Felice and her elegant perfume.

30
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,519
Something wrong?

31
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,589
Ilse?

32
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,900
I said I couldn't babysit tonight,

33
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,870
because I had to look after
my sick father.

34
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,610
So that's Mr. and Mrs. Wust.
- No.
- No?

35
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,845
Not Mr. Wust.

36
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,319
Pretty.

37
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,324
Very pretty.

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,440
Not in the middle of a movement!
Nobody leaves the stage!

39
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,845
Where are my glasses?
- We won't find them now.

40
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,115
I won't leave without them!
- Women!

41
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,618
Once the alarm went off,
Felice took a close look at Mrs. Wust

42
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,122
who I was working for during
my domestic year. She was irresistible.

43
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,959
Are these yours?
- Yes, thank you.

44
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:04,631
Ernst! Ernst! Here!
I almost never wear them, but ...

45
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:07,167
Just the same.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Come on.

46
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,972
Please, use the side exits...

47
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,610
Don't get your hopes up.
She tries it with everyone,

48
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,546
but she always stays with her husband.

49
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,817
Lovely eyes.
- Especially
when the Hitler Youth marches by.

50
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,892
Felice Schragenheim? Miss Schragenheim?

51
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,505
Your father was a good doctor.

52
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,007
Watch out for yourself.

53
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,540
Good heavens.

54
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,945
Faster! Faster!

55
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,653
Here.

56
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,612
Come on.

57
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:39,586
The 50 best photographers were sent to
photograph the most beautiful buildings.

58
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,189
They'll destroy everything.

59
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,593
Here you are. For our English friends.

60
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,162
Are you crazy? What is this?

61
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,332
The latest transport lists from Hungary.
Have Schmidty photograph them.

62
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,102
Till tomorrow.
- Felice.

63
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,340
You've lost all sense of danger.
That's not good ...

64
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,676
for any of us.

65
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,646
No one could disguise herself
as well as Felice.

66
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,850
She worked for a Nazi newspaper,
wrote countless poems

67
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:14,254
and never let anyone with shiny
long hair, like myself, slip away.

68
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,090
I sometimes thought
Felice was lots of people.

69
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,194
The moment I got hold of one,
I was betrayed by another.

70
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,564
She was hard to hold onto,
and only with her grandmother

71
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,732
was she gentle as a lamb.

72
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,637
Aaron, your lips are blue.
Drink this. It'll do you good.

73
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,773
I don't believe it.

74
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:38,679
Grandma!
- Why won't she listen to me?
I've told her at least ten times,

75
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,883
"Stay in the house. Don't go out
on the streets. Don't come here."

76
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,384
Grandma!

77
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,056
Half of Berlin is burning.
Don't tell me you weren't in the cellar!

78
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,191
Sit down!
- Were you in bed?

79
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,728
Were you at a concert?
- What does that have to do with it?

80
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,398
Then don't talk about danger!
- No. Ilse and l...

81
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,301
And not with your mouth full!

82
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:09,209
Sorry, Ilse. I know.
Grandmothers are always a problem.

83
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:15,048
When she was a child, she wanted to ride
her sled backwards over a cliff.

84
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:20,621
Right, Felice?
- Only once.
Anyway, it was my sister's idea.

85
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:25,726
She's in England now! And where are you?
- On the moon! Nothing'll harm me there.

86
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:30,631
Ilse, why are some people crazy
and others not?
- I don't know.

87
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,636
What about her fiancé?
- Who?

88
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,872
Her fiancé. She's engaged.

89
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,142
What's he like? Who is he?

90
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,214
Can he support her?
What does he look like?

91
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:55,022
Handsome, tall, black hair ...

92
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,358
When will he take her away?

93
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,199
Soon, Grandma. Very soon.

94
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,401
Madam,

95
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,839
could we possibly have the rest
of the potatoes?

96
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,783
Ilse, take care of her, won't you?

97
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,059
I had such beautiful dreams about you
this morning. I would give anything ...

98
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,228
... to kiss

99
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,264
your gentle hands ...

100
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:42,336
... and perhaps above your neck.

101
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:50,844
Above your neck ... Even a little more.

102
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,054
Well, Mrs. Schrader? Still in one piece?

103
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,125
We shot down 41 planes,
but my toilet is gone.

104
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:10,230
How's my editorial coming along?
- On the desk in front of you.

105
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,067
My little Mrs. Schrader,
what would I do without you?

106
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,138
Around 5,000 apartments in one night.

107
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:24,144
Total chaos at Party Headquarters.
Everyone's nerves are worn raw.

108
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,447
If people knew what was going on
out there. It's dog eat dog.

109
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,316
Like some?
- No, thanks.

110
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,454
But Goebbels is a genius.

111
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,292
Last night he said
that great people leave their mark.

112
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,029
And when they're gone, the mark remains.
What do you say?

113
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,464
Brilliant.

114
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,573
Keep your eye on it.
- I will.

115
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,818
You're so beautiful.

116
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:13,827
I had such beautiful dreams about you
this morning, and I would give ...

117
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:19,066
"... anything to kiss your gentle hands,
and perhaps above your neck ...

118
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,805
As deeply as a rose."
Not too bad, is it, Ilse?

119
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:29,810
"I only want to be alone with you,
embrace you and tell you again ..."

120
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,178
Bernd! Eberhard!

121
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,315
It wasn't the mountains, dummy!
It was at the zoo, zoo, zoo!

122
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,153
Then I won't play anymore.
And I'll wreck your castle!

123
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,189
That's enough! lf I hear one
more word from you,

124
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,224
I'll send you to the maneaters

125
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,360
in Bavaria!

126
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:50,330
Got it?
- Mommy, who is the General?

127
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:51,932
Quiet!

128
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,170
"I want to find stars
for you and for me.

129
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,839
Shall I tell you why?

130
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,375
I love you.

131
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,847
You are so beautiful. Jaguar."

132
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,585
No one has ever ... I mean ...

133
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:16,356
No one has ever written me like this.

134
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,258
Who could it be?

135
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,893
Ernst?

136
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,329
What's wrong?

137
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,334
Should I see if I can get any semolina?

138
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,570
Semolina? Now?
- Yes.

139
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,104
Now!

140
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:51,325
Want to see something?
Here, have a look.

141
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,360
How can you write such letters?

142
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,965
I only wrote one.
How did she react?

143
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:01,502
Anything dramatic?
Come on, tell me!

144
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,909
Ilse, it was just for fun.
Nothing but good fun. Nothing else.

145
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,478
Is it "fun" that she can smell Jews?

146
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,615
Is it "fun" that Jews are to blame
for every bomb that falls?

147
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,985
Did she really say that?
- This morning.

148
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,954
What a coincidence.
- Why?

149
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,025
I have a date with her.
- You what?

150
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,962
Maybe she really can.
- What?
- Smell Jews.

151
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,398
Felice, could anything ever stop you?

152
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,700
Oh yes. A lot.

153
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,441
What have you got there?

154
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,480
Oh no!

155
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:51,051
Thüringer? My beloved Thüringer sausage.
Is it real?

156
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,188
Yes, from the newspaper office.

157
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,526
This is for you.

158
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,263
The rest is for Grandma
and your parents.

159
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,172
See you later.

160
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:25,853
God! Ilse. He'll be here in 5 minutes.
Where are my glasses?
- There.

161
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,088
Where?
- Over there.

162
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:32,593
I'm so nervous. My God! I'm so nervous!

163
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:40,868
Ilse, how do I look? Good?
- Sure. As always.

164
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:43,604
Hm?
- Attractive as always.

165
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,644
Bernd! Eberhard! Are you crazy?

166
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,647
I cleaned this room 10 minutes ago!

167
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,216
Take your soldiers! Where are your shoes?
- I have them on.

168
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,553
Off the sofa! Get out of here!
Eberhard, put your shoes on!

169
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,156
We were playing.
- Out!

170
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,893
Get out of there. Ilse!
- Yes?

171
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:14,635
No! No! Who did that?
- Not me.
- Me neither.

172
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:19,640
It was a present from Günther.
He's going to kill us, all of us!

173
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,142
Doesn't matter.
Get your coats on and go!

174
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:27,681
But not to the zoo again!
- Yes, come on ...

175
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,251
Stop! Who does this belong to?

176
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:32,619
Me.

177
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,422
Here. Put it on outside.
See you later, my little pet.

178
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,993
Have fun, dear. Give me a kiss.
You, too. Bye bye.

179
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,064
When her beaus came,
Mrs. Wust behaved like a teenager.

180
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:48,001
She cleaned and scrubbed all day,
so that nothing

181
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,437
would interrupt her tender rendezvous.

182
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:54,374
Romantic to the bone, she thought
that Felice's letter was from him.

183
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,445
She feverishly awaited the moment
when she could throw

184
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,415
her hungry heart at his feet.

185
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:07,154
Incomprehensible!
So much trouble for a man.

186
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,134
I tell you something.
They just don't get it.

187
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,239
All anyone ever talks about is food.
We don't have this ...

188
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,674
Hello.
- Or we don't have that.

189
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:31,445
How's it going, boy? Heil Hitler!

190
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,749
Do you love me?
Tell me, do you love me?

191
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:41,255
Look at this. Come on, look at it.

192
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:46,126
Isn't that a tree? Huh? Isn't that a tree?

193
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:51,265
Princess, isn't that a tree?

194
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:55,269
Heavens! Is it your husband?

195
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,505
Lilly!
- It's my father!

196
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,141
And my mother!

197
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,476
What?

198
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,981
Where to? Don't you have a balcony?
- No! No! In there!

199
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,729
What's wrong? Are you ill?
- Ill?

200
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,301
Yes ... I mean no.
I was just on my way out.

201
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:31,038
Where are the children?
- At the zoo.
- Again?

202
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:34,141
They were there last week.
- And the week before.

203
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,711
Is Günther here?
- No, he left his things here.

204
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,113
I didn't know he came.
- I didn't either.

205
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:44,618
And good riddance! Let him talk about
wonder weapons and final victories

206
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:48,489
when he's on the front where
nobody knows what's going on.

207
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,092
Oh, cut it out. You're the one
who keeps babbling about politics.

208
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,561
8,500 tons of explosives in two weeks!

209
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,432
And it's going to go on like that
until that scum is finally gone.

210
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,737
Are you talking about German soldiers?

211
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:11,578
Who is that?
- Yes, well ...
it's Captain Ernst Biermösl.

212
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:21,421
Did you hear that, Lilly?
Those of us on the front have no idea

213
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,657
what's going on.

214
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,460
And the answers are all right here.

215
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:33,400
You and your drinking buddies,
you know what's going on, right?

216
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,371
Regardless, I'd like to know what
you're doing in my daughter's bedroom.

217
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,740
Dancing Bavarian jig.

218
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:45,512
I'm reporting you.

219
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,781
What do you say now?

220
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,417
Nothing.

221
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,323
Now you can smell death
like your son-in-law.

222
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,327
Where's the door?

223
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,900
That was a bit too much, wasn't it?
- Why?

224
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,407
You ... You weren't serious in there?

225
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,610
People like you and your kind won't
be around much longer.

226
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,613
But ...

227
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:21,315
You ...

228
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,819
You ...

229
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,831
Go!

230
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,869
Go! Go!

231
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:51,145
Lilly!
- Why don't you shut up for once!

232
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:59,853
Lilly, where are you going?
- To the zoo to get my children!

233
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:02,856
At least then I'll know what I'm good for.
Heil Hitler.

234
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:26,446
Not even Hitler and his bloodsuckers
could keep Felice from her old habits.

235
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:29,216
Her favorite meeting place
was the "Hotel at the Zoo"

236
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:33,821
where there were so many uniforms that
the race question did not even come up.

237
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,957
That was the real Berlin:
Outside, people were dying,

238
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,593
and inside they were playing
the proper tune.

239
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,261
On behalf of First Lieutenant von Deeken
I'd like you to join us for some wine.

240
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:17,931
Wine? How did you manage that?

241
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,434
Did you sell your castle?

242
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,970
There are ways and means.

243
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:30,344
May we? There are no strings attached.
- What a shame.

244
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:33,814
Just kidding.

245
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,886
Most of us are going back tonight.

246
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:42,489
In two hours.

247
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:48,061
May I ... May I go back with a "yes."

248
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:56,703
But only if you stay at your own table.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

249
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:08,048
It's alright, sweetheart.
It's only your nerves.

250
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,752
It won't be long.

251
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,087
I'm certain.

252
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,857
Perhaps you'd like to freshen up,
alright?

253
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:25,098
Go with her, Klara.

254
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,876
Are you crazy?
What if somebody comes in here?

255
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,314
I sleep on sofas, chairs, everywhere.
Wherever you like.

256
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:44,451
But I don't want to smell bad,
understand? I need something clean.

257
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:51,658
Do you have to scare us like that?
- Here. Where is Felice, damn it!

258
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,530
What's up?
- All this is for Schmidt. Stamps,

259
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,665
five passports,

260
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:02,102
blank Red Cross passports.
- For when?
- Immediately.

261
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:03,904
Did they notice anything?

262
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,476
Hey!

263
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:26,593
Good evening.

264
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,864
You'll be okay in a minute. I'm sure.

265
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:33,467
What's wrong with her? Hungry?

266
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:38,138
I suppose you didn't have any breakfast,
did you, girl?

267
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:41,041
I don't understand what you mean.

268
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,846
She looks like a girl who should buy
some food stamps.

269
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,581
We don't understand.

270
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,083
How much?

271
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:53,086
Ah, we can be friendly, too.

272
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,890
What are you? Jews?

273
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:04,031
She's a Jew, and so are you.

274
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,103
Would you please sell us some?

275
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,105
You little phony!

276
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:18,579
How much?
- 200.

277
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,448
That's ... too much.
- Make it fast.

278
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,486
Heil Hitler.

279
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,993
Exciting times, aren't they?

280
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,442
Ilse is in the hotel.

281
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,412
Mommy, I made lots of boats.

282
00:26:58,185 --> 00:27:01,121
Nice of you to come so soon.
- Shut up!

283
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:10,497
Here's to the Germans,

284
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:14,134
the most honest people in the world.

285
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,406
You'll all destroy yourselves.

286
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,678
Ilse, come on. Sit down.

287
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:26,580
Come on.

288
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:37,558
To the girls.

289
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:42,062
Oh no. It's time to go.

290
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,733
Why? lf we aren't allowed to go
to the theater, let's enjoy Mrs. Wust.

291
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:54,741
Sorry, Mrs. Wust. We were at the zoo,
and I met some girlfriends.

292
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,681
I wasn't aware you knew each other.
- Ilse has told us so much about you.

293
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:04,117
About me? What's there to tell?

294
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:06,787
For example, that you have
a Mother's Cross in silver.

295
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,056
Bronze.

296
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:12,593
Oh!
- And that your children
love to go to the zoo.

297
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,164
And that you have
a superb sense of smell.

298
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:23,704
Mrs. Wust,
could you tell me what I smell like?

299
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:33,714
It's nice. It smells somehow ...
Is it French?

300
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,582
Bravo!

301
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:44,725
I'd better go. Sorry to have bothered
you. I'll take the children.

302
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,326
We'll come along.

303
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,763
To my place?
- Yes.

304
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:52,633
Everyone?
- Mrs. Wust.

305
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,271
We won't bother you at all. Ilse has
told us such wonderful things, and ...

306
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:02,776
Klara, dear, tell her.
Don't be ashamed in front of Mrs. Wust.

307
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,483
My girlfriend had a terrible mishap,
and she needs a bath urgently.

308
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:14,087
That's not so bad.
It can happen to any of us.
- Yes.

309
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:15,589
You see?

310
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,227
Waiter! The check, please.

311
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,729
I don't know why
we met that day at the hotel,

312
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:26,233
or why Mrs. Wust was looking
for her kids that day.

313
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,537
But who really knows
why two people are drawn together?

314
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,607
Thank you.

315
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,678
Three times I was told
to send them away, but I just can't.

316
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,891
Where's your husband?
- On the Eastern front.

317
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,464
Do you think about him often?
- Oh yes, all the time, actually.

318
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:00,400
All the good men are gone.
If you have one, hold onto him.

319
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,437
That's what Günther says, too.
- Pure jealousy.

320
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:08,609
He just wants to keep you from picking
up a young guy with disability papers.

321
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,586
You know all about it, don't you?

322
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:27,194
Felice! Mrs. Wust!

323
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,797
Over here! He'll give us a lift.

324
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:42,176
You have to live your life now, Felice.
It's very important.

325
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:45,546
Now.

326
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,690
Let's go. You're freezing.

327
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:02,329
Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi, Grandma.

328
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:07,501
I'm glad you're still here. This is ...
- Lotte.

329
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,272
Klara. How do you do.

330
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:16,443
That night I realized
Felice's letter wasn't "just for fun"

331
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,878
and amusement.

332
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:22,249
Old man Wust invited a few neighbors
and played the piano.

333
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:25,853
After a while, he and Felice
got Lilly to sing us a song.

334
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,721
She stood and sang.

335
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:32,493
But in reality something else happened.
She took Felice away from me.

336
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:36,530
With every moment, more and more.

337
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:50,444
"Oh, your world is so beautiful,

338
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:58,452
Father, when it shines so golden,

339
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:13,734
when your radiance falls upon the earth

340
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:22,709
and paints the dust until it glistens.

341
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:37,357
When the redness that flickers in the clouds

342
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:44,932
sets upon my silent window."

343
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,869
You can't be serious.
- What?

344
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,374
To flirt with her.

345
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,749
Flirting is always serious.
It's love which sometimes ...
- What?

346
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:05,586
... looks funny.

347
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:18,832
Well, that's it.

348
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,151
That was highly dramatic! Impressive!
"We were stupid, not you!"

349
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,754
Ilse, we're in the street.
- I am. You are. Don't say "we!"

350
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:44,424
You're celebrating New Year's Eve with
her. Should I make the bed for you two?

351
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:48,495
I'm good at it. It's my domestic year.
- I didn't want to hurt you, Ilse.

352
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:51,532
You don't have to apologize.
She's good for you, Felice.

353
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,700
She can do what we can't.

354
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,436
I hide you.
But with her you talk about love.

355
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:00,440
The main thing is, you feel good. I hate you.

356
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,177
What does she have that I don't have?

357
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:08,182
Nothing, absolutely nothing. She isn't
better or worse than any of us.

358
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,752
How can you say that? How?

359
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,691
Has she risked her life? Would she lie
and steal and fight for you?

360
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,428
Do you think she'd take the risks
my father takes?

361
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:26,066
She has no idea what it's like listening
to every idiot who comes up the stairs.

362
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,471
But you know how it is, Felice.
Your behavior just makes me sick!

363
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,515
So send me a bill.

364
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:48,489
I'm sorry.
- What for? You're right.

365
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,795
"God created the world, Felice.
You didn't."

366
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,032
That's what my father always said to me.

367
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:07,641
My sister, my mother ... they all agreed
"Felice is crazy."

368
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,110
And do you know why?

369
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:13,914
Because for me
nothing can be taken for granted.

370
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,482
No God.

371
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:21,155
No car that picks me up,
no Ilse to help me,

372
00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:24,825
and no "thank you"
I have to tell her every day.

373
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:31,265
You want something special, and I'm not.

374
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:38,672
I am ungrateful
and desperate for admiration.

375
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,909
Say whatever you like.

376
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:48,549
But don't make me a victim,

377
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:55,222
because it's my goddamned, mediocre
little right to be free.

378
00:35:57,124 --> 00:36:00,060
As long as I can.
- It's alright.

379
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:01,895
No, it isn't.

380
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:06,300
You condemn Wust, because
she has no cause. Is that a crime?

381
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,670
Did she ever harm you?
Married at twenty?

382
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:14,174
Four children? Is that the problem?
Or is it the lovers?

383
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:19,012
He fools around, and she should suffer?
No, Ilse!

384
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,181
You don't know anything about her.

385
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:25,819
Maybe she knows more than you think
about people and death and life!

386
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,923
I gave you my friendship, Ilse,
and my love. That's all I have.

387
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,599
Who loves whom?
- What?

388
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:41,835
My father was really a communist
and a helpful person.

389
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,037
But when Felice asked him politely

390
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:47,708
if he'd heard of Sappho, he looked at her
with all the Kremlin's wrath

391
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,810
and threw her out.

392
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:54,848
Well, look at you.
- My father threw her out.
- Bravo.

393
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:59,119
She's moving in with Mrs. Wust.
- Shut up!

394
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:03,824
Why? No one would suspect you, if you
were with a conformist!
- Jealous?

395
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:07,327
Why jealous?
She's constantly nibbling on you.

396
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:11,198
I'm the one who should be jealous.
- Are you?
- No.

397
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,635
You see? She doesn't care.
Whatever you do, she doesn't care.

398
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,004
You're early, aren't you?
- Sorry.

399
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:20,340
My lover always says goodbye,
as if it were the last time.

400
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:23,343
Lotte and her men!
- Don't start that again!

401
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:29,116
Hey, Schmidty!
How can we get in the mood

402
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,587
with music like that?
- It was never a problem for you before.

403
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:39,193
Here, I don't want anything
to do with it. Get dressed.

404
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:43,297
But why? Everything's gone perfectly up to now.
- I'm giving you 3 minutes.

405
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,966
Stefan, I have 5 people
who have to get away.

406
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:51,138
I've always said, steal them wherever
you like, but not from official places!

407
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:57,211
The Red Cross!
- Stefan, please!

408
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:06,720
4 weeks.

409
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:11,758
We could all be dead in 4 weeks.
- That's very possible.

410
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,112
I want to see more of the fat one. Our soldiers

411
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,683
want something to hold onto.
- Who's fat here?
- Dumb question.

412
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,654
What does he mean by "hold onto?"
- "Hold onto" means ...

413
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:42,723
"hold onto it."

414
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,729
What do you think the soldiers do with the pictures?
- They look at them.

415
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:52,432
Very good. And then?
- They pin them on the wall.

416
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:54,268
And then?

417
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:00,440
They look again.
- Is she joking?
- No, she really is that stupid.

418
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:01,909
Yes.

419
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:45,119
I have to go to the editorial office.
What's keeping you?
- We're ready.

420
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,422
Lotte!
- Yeah, go ahead.

421
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:52,893
Next week? Promise?
- Slut!

422
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:58,165
Why? The cellar of the newspaper office
is excellent.

423
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:02,169
There are cots, bed sheets
and sometimes even milk.

424
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:05,372
I'll just say my house was bombed.

425
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:08,242
And then I bent down

426
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:11,745
very close to her stupid face and said,

427
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:15,849
"If you want to buy a dress
for 400 marks,

428
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:20,954
that's your business." Half her villa
burned down, in the middle of Dahlem!

429
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:24,691
My father said she could bathe
at our house whenever she liked.

430
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:28,695
Madam?
- Yes.

431
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,833
Could we see your identification?

432
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:39,072
What are they doing? What?
- Talking.

433
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,844
I'm sure I have it ...
- Where are you coming from?

434
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,016
I had it in my pocket.

435
00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:54,087
Alright, what's your name?

436
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:59,092
I'm going back.
- Keep going! Don't turn around!

437
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,061
What's your name?

438
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:05,199
Stop!

439
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:08,469
Ilse, get her away! Fast!

440
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,039
Fast!

441
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:38,932
Now that the Jewish mania for
destruction has shown its hideous face

442
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,835
in the deeds of those aerial pirates,

443
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:45,772
even the weak and cowardly elements
among us have realized

444
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:53,514
that National Socialism is our people's
greatest and only hope.

445
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,251
The world can mock us,
but it will tremble when it realizes

446
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:01,555
what tremendous feats
this people is capable of.

447
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:08,529
Lower Rhineland ... Yes, that's it.

448
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:15,002
Your head ... I've always wondered
where you come from.

449
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,208
Here you are.

450
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,580
Drink it.

451
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:28,982
No, thanks.

452
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:30,584
Go on.

453
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:34,021
Drink ...

454
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,091
You're safe here.

455
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:43,931
Listen, Mrs. Schrader.
We'll make a deal.

456
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:46,633
Forget your bombed-out apartment,

457
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:52,105
and I won't tell a soul that you have
the most beautiful smile in the world.

458
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:57,978
I've often wondered
what goes on in your mind?

459
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,348
I haven't found an answer yet.

460
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:08,889
But I'm sure that one of these days,
you'll give it to me.

461
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,326
Hello, Mrs. Wust speaking.

462
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,934
Hello? Who is there?

463
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:23,130
Günther?

464
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:30,037
Günther?

465
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:46,987
I'm a bad boy, Lilly.
It isn't easy, I know.

466
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:57,397
But it's my apartment, my pipe,
my wife ...

467
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:02,035
my children. I'm home, you see?

468
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:06,240
I'm home!

469
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,310
I want you and your hands
on the arch of night,

470
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:14,381
to send you all the love
I've ever felt inside.

471
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:18,285
Whoever I may have liked before

472
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,624
I feel ...

473
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:26,794
since I met you.

474
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:39,540
Perhaps ...
Perhaps in all the others ...

475
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,111
it's only you I've always loved.

476
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,080
Only you.

477
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,490
Now the night comes to an end ...

478
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:03,764
Alone, alone, alone.

479
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:14,274
But I think of your hands ...

480
00:46:17,244 --> 00:46:21,682
and tenderly I fall asleep.

481
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:42,836
We found that among her things:
no name, no clues, nothing.

482
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:54,281
Have it analyzed by Department 4c.
Something always turns up.

483
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:03,690
Berlin was at its end.
Death and destruction were everywhere.

484
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:07,161
Still, we wanted to celebrate
New Year's Eve like everyone else.

485
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:11,465
Felice managed to get herself
and Erika's beauty parlor invited

486
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:13,367
to Mrs. Wust's.

487
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:16,570
Imagine that disgusting, sweaty
little lieutenant ...

488
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:22,443
chewing on our pretty Marlene
as if she were a sausage.

489
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,746
At least better than the actor Rühmann!
- Rühmann!

490
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,149
"I break the hearts
of the vainest women,

491
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:32,786
because I'm so tiny and so greedy
and so passionate."

492
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:35,756
Felice!

493
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,660
Just what I expected.

494
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:42,930
You don't miss any opportunity, do you?

495
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:53,941
Did they really shock you?
- Oh no. They were very ...

496
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:55,843
Very what?

497
00:47:58,178 --> 00:47:59,680
I'd like to go.

498
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:14,728
Your tickets, please.

499
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:19,833
Did I disappoint you?

500
00:48:23,804 --> 00:48:26,774
Would you rather I call off the party?
- No.

501
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:33,714
I'm looking forward to it. Really.

502
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,958
Keep going onwards, onwards, my ladies.
This is neither French nor Scottish

503
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:48,695
nor Italian.
It's my good old German rosehips,

504
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:51,799
home-brewed and extremely effective.

505
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:58,705
If Churchill thinks he's done us in, he's wrong.
Not while we're dancing.

506
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:03,977
Stop jabbering and sit down.
- Boy, Hilde. You're really drunk.

507
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,649
Things are really hopping here!

508
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:18,759
Who ... who are these people?

509
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:25,599
Girlfriends ...
They are all girlfriends.

510
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:36,577
Look at that brave soldier!
- Happy New Year.

511
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:41,849
Look at that.
Say, Sweetie. Is that your spouse?

512
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,023
Happy New Year, darling.

513
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:53,494
Jesus, Lilly.
This is what I call New Year's Eve!

514
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:02,002
Happy New Year!
I'm what you might call the host.

515
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,642
May l, Mrs. Jäger?

516
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:44,711
Nice to see you.

517
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,949
Your life is wonderful, Felice.

518
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:26,787
You're free.

519
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,038
Where are your parents?

520
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:50,744
Dead.
- I'm sorry.

521
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:56,150
My God! Excuse me. I'm really sorry.

522
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:03,056
I'm sorry. Please, excuse me.

523
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,896
Want to see someone
who always does the wrong thing?

524
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,598
Here I am.

525
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:31,985
Felice?

526
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,769
Yes?

527
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,943
Why do you mean so much to me?

528
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:39,052
Ilse and Günther are kissing.
Isn't that funny?

529
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:40,988
Ilse and Günther!

530
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:56,870
What kind of game are you all playing?
What kind of game?

531
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:35,742
Felice ...

532
00:54:56,864 --> 00:54:58,766
Do you want to see me?

533
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:18,585
He wants to steal those kids!
The first, second and third

534
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:23,390
try to escape, but they aren't able to.

535
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,393
Where were you?
- Out walking.

536
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:31,665
Alright, stop!
Attention! Eyes straight ahead!

537
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:35,135
Forward march! And get dressed!
The first to finish

538
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,204
gets to see photos of my unit.

539
00:55:38,238 --> 00:55:39,606
Good morning.

540
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:43,844
Come into the kitchen.

541
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:49,950
Real coffee! Just for us.

542
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:55,155
That Ilse!

543
00:55:58,392 --> 00:55:59,626
Happy New Year.

544
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:17,978
Know what I don't understand?
Why men are so susceptible.

545
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:20,781
You have a wife and kids. Everything's great.

546
00:56:21,148 --> 00:56:23,183
Suddenly an Ilse or a Käthe

547
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:26,920
or whatever she's called
comes and looks at you.

548
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:32,292
She just looks at you. And you think,
"Damn! Hands off! Taboo!"

549
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:36,897
But she's still there.
You women don't know what it's like.

550
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:38,465
You need a man to guide you,

551
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:40,801
a man with a sense of responsibility.

552
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:45,839
But you have no idea what it costs, Lilly.

553
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:52,679
Dammit! You know
it doesn't mean anything to me,

554
00:56:53,046 --> 00:56:54,782
but I have a hard time saying "no."

555
00:56:56,049 --> 00:56:58,018
It has nothing to do with you.

556
00:56:58,385 --> 00:57:00,888
What? Nothing to do with me?

557
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:08,061
You're not even jealous?
Not even angry?

558
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:15,869
Lilly, do you know
why I came back yesterday?

559
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:20,340
I wanted to tell you on New Year's
that you're a wonderful woman

560
00:57:20,874 --> 00:57:23,377
and that I'd do everything not to lose you.

561
00:57:35,322 --> 00:57:37,324
Here, this is my unit.

562
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:42,229
Since all hell's broken loose out there,
I know what I'm capable of.

563
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,064
What?

564
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:46,266
I'm the kind of guy who comes back.

565
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,937
I look at my comrades,
and I know who won't make it.

566
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:56,877
Just before I left, one guy got
half his skull blown away.

567
00:57:57,311 --> 00:58:03,117
He looked at me and said, "Oh man, Wust.
It was all too short, huh?"

568
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:07,888
You have to duck fast, Lilly.
That's the secret.

569
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,691
Send the older kids to the country.

570
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:14,094
Who knows what'll happen.
- Daddy!

571
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:18,832
Now, now. Don't cry. Not my big boy.

572
00:58:19,466 --> 00:58:22,369
When I'm not here
you're the boss, okay?

573
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:25,873
Come on. Lie down. It'll be okay.

574
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,209
Go to sleep.

575
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:35,215
Sleep tight.

576
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:43,824
The Russians sing all night long.

577
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:52,499
We're going to win, Lilly.

578
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:56,036
We'll win!

579
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:05,379
... Germans are capable of overcoming
mental and physical obstacles.

580
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:09,983
The German people have demonstrated
their strength in the past years.

581
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:14,188
Without a doubt, they will emerge
from this tremendous war

582
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:17,891
as the most glorious people
of all time.

583
00:59:18,425 --> 00:59:24,364
Of course, our victories in the early
war years were even more glorious.

584
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:28,836
But this year
we have to prove ourselves.

585
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:32,539
We have to prove to ourselves
and to history

586
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:39,780
that we have the strength
to overcome the biggest obstacles

587
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:41,181
and we won't fail.

588
00:59:41,548 --> 00:59:47,054
Our courage and our stamina
will be strengthened.

589
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,390
And this we have done.

590
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:02,169
May I come in?

591
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:37,371
Felice ...

592
01:00:41,442 --> 01:00:43,210
Please, don't hurt me.

593
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:49,383
I'd better go.
- I'd die, if you did.
