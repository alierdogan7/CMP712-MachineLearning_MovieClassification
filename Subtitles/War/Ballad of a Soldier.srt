<i>This is the road to town.</i>

8
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,195
<i>Those who leave our village,</i>

00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,206
<i>and those who later return</i>
<i>to their birthplace,</i>

10

<i>walk along this road.</i>

11
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,772
<i>She's not waiting for anyone.</i>

12
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,577
<i>The one she used to wait for,</i>
<i>her son Alyosha,</i>

13
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,379
<i>did not return from the war.</i>

14
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,018
<i>He's buried far from his birthplace,</i>

15
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,325
<i>near a town with a foreign name.</i>

16
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,795
<i>Strangers bring flowers to his grave.</i>

17
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,333
<i>They call him a Russian soldier,</i>

18
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,734
<i>a hero, a liberator.</i>

19
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,310
<i>But to her he was simply a son,</i>

20
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,140
<i>about whom she knew everything</i>

21
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,308
<i>from the day he was born</i>

22
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:10,484
<i>to the day he left</i>
<i>along this road for the front.</i>

23
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,650
<i>He was our friend.</i>

24
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,594
<i>We will tell his story,</i>
<i>a story not everyone knows--</i>

25
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,633
<i>not even her--his mother.</i>

BALLAD OF A SOLDIER

27
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,694
- That's it! Let's go!
- But what about reporting?

28
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,525
You want to report
from the next world? Scram!

29
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:31,900
Eagle! Eagle! I see tanks!

30
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,571
Eagle! Eagle! Do you read me?

31
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,701
Eagle! This is Finch.

32
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,848
This is Finch! Eagle!

33
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,544
This is Finch! Answer me!

34
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,489
Yes, this is Finch!

35
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,219
I see tanks! Four of them!

36
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,986
They're heading straight towards me.

37
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:02,659
There's no infantry.
I can pull back.

38
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,945
You don't like that, eh?

39
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,283
<i>- Skvortsov, report to the general.</i>
- Skvortsov, report to the general.

40
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,991
Here he is, Comrade General.

41
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,531
Private Skvortsov,
reporting as ordered.

42
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,074
Well, hero, come here.

43
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,380
Tell us everything that happened.

44
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,041
Were you at the observation point?
- Yes.

45
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,118
Well, what happened?

46
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:48,125
Comrade General, to be honest,
I was afraid!

47
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,222
They were so close...

48
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,127
I was scared.

49
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,133
You were so scared
that you knocked out two tanks?

50
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,530
Out of fright?

51
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,732
Everybody hear?
I wish everybody were so scared.

52
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,902
Wait a minute. Is it possible
that somebody else did it?

53
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,145
No, it was me.

54
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,013
Excellent.

55
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,716
I'm putting you up for a decoration.

56
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,585
Include Skvortsov on the list.
- Yes, Comrade General.

57
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,254
Please make note of this.

58
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,367
Comrade General,
instead of my decoration,

59
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,664
could I go home to see my mother?

60
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,546
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

61
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,681
When I was leaving, I didn't have time
to say good-bye to my mother.

62
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:50,650
And I just got a letter from her.
The roof is leaking.

63
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,681
Please let me go, Comrade General.

64
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,188
We'd all like to go home, Skvortsov,

65
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,323
but we can't leave the front.

66
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,801
This is war and we're all soldiers.

67
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,306
I wouldn't have asked you

68
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,001
if we weren't all taking a rest now.

69
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,476
I just need one day,
Comrade General.

70
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,673
I'll fix the roof
and come right back.

71
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,688
Well, should we let Skvortsov
go home?

72
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,123
Let him fix the roof?

73
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,954
Just make sure you're back on time!

74
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:35,193
Well, I... Comrade General...
I'll do whatever it takes!

75
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,769
Sit down.

76
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,430
You're pretty lucky, Skvortsov.

77
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,600
Where are you going?

78
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,505
To Georgievsk, the village of Sosnovka.

79
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,238
I could be there by tomorrow.
- No, my friend.

80
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,414
The way things are going nowadays,
a day won't be enough.

81
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:56,316
I'll give you two days to get there
and two to get back.

82
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,982
And two to fix the roof.

83
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,581
Satisfied?

84
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,587
Comrade General.

85
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,433
Can I go now?
- Go!

86
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,973
Just make sure you're back on time.
- Yes, Comrade General!

87
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,532
Fellows, give us a hand!

88
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,855
- Take care!
- Thanks, guys!

89
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,928
- Have a good trip!
- Thank you!

90
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,656
Hey, friend! Wait a minute!

91
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,163
Are you going on leave?
- Yes.

92
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,965
- To Georgievsk?
- Yes.

93
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,597
I'm from Uzlovaya.
We're neighbors!

94
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,438
Stop by at this address.
- I won't have enough time. I can't.

95
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,206
You have to change trains
at Uzlovaya anyway.

96
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,010
Chekhov Street.
Not far from the station.

97
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,350
Stop by, friend!
- Okay. What should I say?

98
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,384
Say that you saw me!

99
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:41,517
Tell Liza that her Sergei is all right,
that you saw him yourself.

100
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,859
Tell his Liza that he dreams
about her day and night.

101
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,025
Sergei, you ought to give her
some sort of present.

102
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,569
What can he give?
Everything he has is army-issue.

103
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,732
Quit talking!

104
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,775
Sergeant, give Sergei a cake of soap!

105
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,572
It's for his wife!

106
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,841
- His ration is only for one washing.
- Give him a whole cake.

107
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,882
I have only two cakes
for the entire platoon.

108
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,781
- Well, give him one.
- That's against regulations.

109
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:11,152
- Come on, Comrade Sergeant!
- Don't be stingy!

110
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,985
It's for his wife.

111
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,553
Open it.

112
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,225
She's going to be happy.

113
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,995
- Soap is now a delicacy.
- A deficit, you moron.

114
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,469
She'll be happy regardless.

115
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,176
- Let him have the second one, too!
- He's right, Sergeant!

116
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,847
Come on, Sergeant.

117
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,609
- Comrade Sergeant...
- Here. Take it!

118
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,053
Close it.

119
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,763
- 7 Chekhov Street.
- I'll find it.

120
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,243
Let me help you.

121
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,489
Where are you going?
- To Gorisov.

122
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,496
Me, too.
That's where I'm changing trains.

123
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,192
Going home?
- Yes, I've finished fighting.

124
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,698
I'm going home, too.

125
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,905
On leave. I got lucky.

126
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,073
We'll be traveling
to Gorisov together.

127
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,208
Thanks, friend.

128
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:53,308
- I'll help you in Gorisov, too.
- Someone will meet me there.

129
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,919
Your wife?

130
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,821
My wife.

131
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:02,092
Keep an eye on my suitcase.
I have to send a telegram.

132
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,386
What on earth are you doing?

133
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,356
The train's here.
It's about to leave.

134
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,654
- What's with you?
- What do you mean? We have to go!

135
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,198
I have your suitcase.
- So go by yourself.

136
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,533
- What's wrong?
- What do you want? Beat it!

137
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,638
Beat it? I have your suitcase.

138
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,008
Fine, I'm going.
- Wait a minute. Don't be angry, friend.

139
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,217
Things are hard for me.

140
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,316
I wrote to my wife
and told her I wouldn't be coming.

141
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,859
- Why?
- I have to.

142
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,221
Even before the war,
things weren't working out.

143
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,355
I was jealous of her.
And now--

144
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,127
Be quiet!

145
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,499
I don't want to, you understand?

146
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,365
She's young and pretty.

147
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,135
She'll find her happiness, right?

148
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,975
I don't know.

149
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,852
She will.

150
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,789
- What about you?
- What?

151
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,861
Where will you go now?

152
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,964
Russia is a big country.

153
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,267
That's despicable!

154
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,869
It's despicable to think that way!

155
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,142
She's waiting for you.
And what do you do?

156
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,514
You lie! It's despicable!

157
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,330
Wanna smoke?

158
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,637
Got a piece of paper for me?

159
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,776
- Here.
- Hey, friend, can you spare one?

160
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,320
Pass one over here.

161
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:50,912
How thin!

162
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,186
Kill the enemy. Read it
and pass it on to your comrade.

163
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,255
And how's the tobacco supply
on the front?

164
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,998
On the front? It's available.

165
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,161
It's available, hero!

166
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,332
That reminds me of the soldier

167
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,533
who asked a collective farmer
for a glass of water and said,

168
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,574
"Lady, give me something to drink.

169
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,079
I'm so hungry
that I don't have a place to sleep."

170
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,214
Exactly!
The story of your life.

171
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,113
A good woman.
I can't forget her.

172
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,159
Then why forget about her?

173
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,519
After the war, go and marry her.

174
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,765
You fool!
She's already got a husband.

175
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,463
- Pockmarked like you?
- No, smooth.

176
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,931
Why would she trade
a guy with smooth skin

177
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,474
for someone pockmarked like you?

178
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:49,905
How should I know?
Maybe he has some other defect!

179
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,980
- Are you accompanying your friend?
- No, I'm by myself.

180
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,786
- Are you on a mission?
- No.

181
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,190
- Being transferred?
- No again.

182
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,890
- Then what?
- Home. On leave.

183
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,694
Who do you think you're kidding?
Come on!

184
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,996
I'm telling the truth.
I knocked out two tanks!

185
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,065
You see, even a signalman--

186
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,641
A signalman. Well, that's about
average for a signalman, of course.

187
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,041
What did you knock them out with?

188
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,012
A telephone receiver.
It was double-barreled!

189
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,842
You know how it is
with these signalmen?

190
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,954
They walk around,
they see a tank.

191
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,515
First one, then another,
and then into his bag.

192
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,626
I'm serious! When the general
called me to the bunker--

193
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,499
- Soldier, enough already.
- Enough about you talking to the general!

194
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,370
Gimme this.
I'll prove it to you

195
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,704
What are you doing?

196
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,640
- Look!
- Looks like him!

197
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,843
Direct hit!

198
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,147
Why on earth did you ruin it?

199
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,689
I have a lot more just like it.

200
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,397
Don't think about it, son.

201
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,802
Everything will work out.

202
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,368
I can't.

203
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:01,105
I have a daughter
who just got married

204
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,844
and she's already a widow.

205
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,246
- You should go. Thanks.
- Yes, in a minute.

206
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,328
Let's go.

207
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,962
<i>Vasya!</i>

208
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,186
Oh, Vasya.

209
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,696
You're back. You're alive.

210
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,910
Well, here I am.

211
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,377
Now we're together.

212
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:40,631
I was in such a hurry.
The buses aren't running.

213
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,038
It's just a shaving.
I work at the factory now.

214
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,840
The steel coming out these days
is very hard.

215
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,256
<i>So, citizen, are you going</i>
<i>to take this car or not?</i>

216
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,352
Yes, coming.

217
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,824
Vasya, this is the driver.
Where are your things?

218
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,099
- There it is.
- I'll get it.

219
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,862
- Where's the boy?
- What boy?

220
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,768
The boy. The soldier.
He accompanied me.

221
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,775
A hero! He knocked out two tanks!
- Let's hurry. I'm running late.

222
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,640
How unfortunate. He left.

223
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,573
- Hi, friend.
- Hi.

224
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,906
- Are we taking off now? To Georgievsk?
- Yep.

225
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,604
- Listen, friend--
- He won't allow it.

226
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,341
Who won't allow it?

227
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,376
- The lieutenant.
- Do you understand what's going on?

228
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:04,080
I understand perfectly.
It's not allowed. It's strategic cargo.

229
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,589
- Hay is strategic cargo?
- Depends on who it's for.

230
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,524
- For horses. Who else?
- Depends on what kind of horses.

231
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,762
Fine, your hay is strategic!

232
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,627
But you've got to understand.
I've come from the front.

233
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:19,193
I'm on leave. I've already used up
half a day and I only have two.

234
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,865
I understand perfectly,
but the lieutenant won't.

235
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,568
- What kind of man is he?
- Him? A beast! Got it?

236
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,015
Listen, let's forget
about the lieutenant.

237
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,555
I'll climb into the car
and he won't know anything about it.

238
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,989
As if I feel like getting
court-martialed for you.

239
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,190
Why court-martialed?

240
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,460
You set the wagon on fire,
and I get court-martialed.

241
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,264
- Why on earth would I set it on fire?
- How would I know?

242
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,666
What do you have in that bag?
Maybe something flammable?

243
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,277
It's just canned beef. Look.

244
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,209
Canned beef?

245
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,094
So, you're trying to bribe a guard?

246
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,499
- What? Give me that!
- What's with you?

247
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,901
I was just kidding.
What, you can't take a joke?

248
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,003
Well, you convinced me.
Climb in.

249
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,180
Not a sound. Got it?

250
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,215
Got it.

251
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,243
Where are you going?

252
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,974
Let me go! Mama!

253
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,677
Let me go, you scoundrel!
Let me go!

254
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,053
What are you doing?
You're crazy!

255
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,994
You fool!

256
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:44,632
Leave me alone!
What have I ever done to you?

257
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,172
Don't come near me!
- Are you insane?

258
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,645
- If you come near me, you'll find out.
- Don't even think about it.

259
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,300
Get away from the door.

260
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,831
Get away, I tell you!
- I won't.

261
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,099
What's with you?

262
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,110
- What's with you?
- Why do you keep screaming?

263
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,473
- Don't come near me.
- Then get away from the door.

264
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,048
I won't.

265
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,482
I was right. You're insane.

266
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,688
Well, to hell with you.

267
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,029
Go ahead and jump!
Break your neck!

268
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,862
Why should I?
We're stopping soon.

269
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,610
Open the door. I'm getting off.

270
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,215
<i>Keep away</i>
<i>from the military transport.</i>

271
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,380
Anyone caught
will be court-martialed.

272
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,548
Hey, citizen, I'm talking to you!

273
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,956
<i>Anyone caught will be shot!</i>

274
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,652
- There's no point in that.
- It's all your fault.

275
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,748
I threw my things out
because of you.

276
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,690
You would have killed yourself.

277
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,922
It's none of your business.
Quit pestering me.

278
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,225
Pestering you?

279
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,527
You jumped into the car yourself,
and I'm pestering you?

280
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,659
Then why were you hiding
in the straw?

281
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,897
- You think I was hiding from you?
- Who else?

282
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,769
From the lieutenant!

283
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,106
What lieutenant?

284
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:36,510
The one in charge of the transport.

285
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,583
He's a beast.
I snuck on the train, too.

286
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,152
If they catch me,
they'll make me get off.

287
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,380
I'll have to wait
for a passenger train, or even fly.

288
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,988
I'm scared of bigger things than you.
I thought you were the lieutenant.

289
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,392
I had a terrible fright
and got slapped in the face,

290
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,796
and it's all my fault.

291
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,104
I had everything in my bag:
my things, some bread, a skirt.

292
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,834
Everything.

293
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,500
It's nothing.

294
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,011
When you go back,
you can find your bag.

295
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:12,014
- You think so?
- Of course. Where could it go?

296
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,914
It's probably waiting for you
on a bridge somewhere right now.

297
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,828
This train just keeps
going and going.

298
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,821
We're pulling in.

299
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,795
When you get off,
go quickly so nobody sees you.

300
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,731
What if I can't find my bag?

301
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,076
You know what?
Don't get out.

302
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,784
I have some food

303
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,350
and the car is comfortable.

304
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,554
No, I'd better get out.

305
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,668
Any chance you'll stay?

306
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,005
No.

307
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,998
Someone's out there.

308
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,478
Yes.

309
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,051
Want a bite to eat?

310
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,620
Eat?

311
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,219
No, thanks. I'm full.

312
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,485
If you want any,
you're welcome to it.

313
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,191
Don't be shy.
Look at this <i>salo.</i>

314
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,561
<i>- Salo?</i>
- Yes. Try some.

315
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:21,297
Well, maybe just a little piece.

316
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,621
Like it?

317
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,920
Dry rations.

318
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,297
I love the wafers too.

319
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:55,369
Remember, before the war?

320
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,533
- I lived in a village before the war.
- I lived in a city.

321
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,668
- Are you mad at me?
- For what?

322
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,735
Because I hit you.

323
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,207
It happens.
It made us friends.

324
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,147
<i>-Stepanov, do you have the tarpaulin?</i>
<i>- No, Gavrilkin has it.</i>

325
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,547
<i>Call Gavrilkin.</i>

326
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,484
<i>Gavrilkin, do you have</i>
<i>the tarpaulin?</i>

327
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:49,089
Please forgive me.
I was so foolish.

328
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,525
Me, too. I frightened you.

329
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:03,266
You know what?
Let's introduce ourselves.

330
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,771
Let's.

331
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,648
My name is Alexei.

332
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,775
And mine is Shura.

333
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,010
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

334
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:32,101
- Where are you going?
- Home, on leave. You?

335
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,060
<i>Hurry up, Gavrilkin!</i>

336
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,196
<i>I'm coming, Comrade Lieutenant.</i>
<i>Something's jammed.</i>

337
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,537
Hide! Hurry!

338
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,010
Here it is, Comrade Lieutenant.

339
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,182
<i>- What on earth are you doing?</i>
- I'm coming, Comrade Lieutenant.

340
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,821
He didn't notice us.

341
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,928
Were you scared, Shura?
- No.

342
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,600
- You're a scaredy-cat.
- No.

343
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,699
Shura, who are you going to see?

344
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,803
I'm on my way to Kupinsk.

345
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,578
To see my fiancé.

346
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,671
He's a pilot.
He's in the hospital.

347
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,307
He's very badly wounded.
Honest!

348
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,082
I'm getting off now.

349
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,990
Why?

350
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,396
Did I offend you?

351
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,296
Then why?
-Just because.

352
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,900
- You think I won't take you to your fiancé?
- I don't think anything.

353
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,253
I'm going out for water.

354
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,074
- Heard any news?
- Those rotting swine!

355
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:29,145
The battle for Novorossisk
is getting fierce.

356
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:40,850
We'll turn you over to the war tribunal
for sneaking on board.

357
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,025
Follow me.

358
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,295
Follow me, I tell you.
- I won't.

359
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,521
Hey, stop that.

360
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,295
Ah, here's her lovey-dove now.
What's going on here?

361
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,839
We had an agreement,
and you're sneaking civilians aboard?

362
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,238
What difference does it make
if it's two people instead of one?

363
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,072
A big difference.
Come on, citizen.

364
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:05,137
She's not going anywhere, got it?
Get out of here.

365
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,143
What?

366
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,748
Who are you to give orders?

367
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,651
You've got it made: hay, a girl--

368
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,348
What? Shut up.

369
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,323
You think I didn't see?
I saw everything.

370
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,591
- What did you see?
- The two of you, tumbling in the hay.

371
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,802
Fine.

372
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:34,535
Attacking a guard while on duty.

373
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,506
You know what will happen?

374
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,448
- You miserable shit!
- From your point of view.

375
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,278
A miserable shit from your point of view.
From mine, I'm priceless.

376
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,093
Get the hell off this train,
both of you.

377
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,859
If you don't,
I have every right to shoot.

378
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,764
So, shoot. We're not scared.

379
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,771
You still haven't seen the lieutenant.
That's why you're so brave.

380
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,573
Enough. We're both a little
hot under the collar.

381
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,512
Let's talk it out.
- I have nothing to say to you.

382
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,640
Get out of here, and take your--

383
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,719
I'll give two warning shots
and then--

384
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,515
You've really made yourself
at home here.

385
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,648
What if I give you
another can of meat?

386
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,517
How about two?

387
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,628
It will take much more than that
to make up for the insult.

388
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,957
You want me to apologize to you?

389
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,303
Fine. Give me the canned meat.

390
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,651
What's going on here?

391
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,181
Comrade Lieutenant,
they snuck into the car.

392
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,889
I'm taking appropriate measures.

393
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,791
Who are they?

394
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,221
Private Skvortsov. On leave.

395
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,799
Where are you headed?

396
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,461
To Georgievsk, Comrade Lieutenant.
Here are my papers.

397
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,967
I have only two days,
and I'm already late.

398
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,447
You're a hero.

399
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,713
And the girl? Is she with you?

400
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,550
- Yes.
- No.

401
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:30,252
She lost all of her things...money,
bread... so I had to...

402
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,885
- All right, all right.
- No, really! We--

403
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,961
-Just be careful with fire.
- Okay.

404
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,395
What's that?

405
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,031
Well, Comrade Lieutenant,
it's sort of canned meat.

406
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:48,077
Who did you take it from? From them?
Give it back immediately.

407
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,575
But they gave it to me voluntarily.

408
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,812
Voluntarily?
Two days under arrest!

409
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,407
- For what?
- Five days?

410
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,714
- But I--
- Repeat the order!

411
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,017
- Five days...
- How disgraceful.

412
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:11,330
I told you: He's a beast.

413
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:28,878
Now we don't have to be afraid
of any beast.

414
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,014
Beast!

415
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,524
Alyosha, it's so pleasant
when you think badly of someone,

416
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,593
only to discover that he's good.

417
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,888
Yes, that lieutenant is a good man.

418
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,359
Very.

419
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,479
Do you believe in friendship?

420
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,216
Of course I do. On the front,
you'd be lost without it.

421
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,484
No, I know that.
I mean between a boy and a girl.

422
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,319
Some girls are even better
than boys.

423
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,658
I think so, too.

424
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,500
But there are some who believe
that they can only be in love.

425
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,161
Nonsense.

426
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,330
I used to be friends with a girl.

427
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,601
We were friends
and didn't think at all about love.

428
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:30,271
- Maybe you were in love and didn't notice.
- With her? No.

429
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,077
- Maybe she was in love with you.
- She was just a little girl.

430
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,675
Our neighbor Zoika.

431
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,347
No, love is something different.

432
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:54,900
Alyosha, would you like
to have a friend?

433
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,841
A true friend,
to have your whole life?

434
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,975
Me, too! Why do you think I'm traveling?
Do you think--

435
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,844
You're doing the right thing,
going to him. You're a good girl.

436
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,349
- That's not the only reason.
- You're a good girl.

437
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,353
You're not some sort of floozy.

438
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,922
No, Alyosha,
you don't know anything.

439
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,532
You know what, Alyosha?
- What?

440
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,575
I'm so thirsty. Aren't you?

441
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,446
Yes.

442
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,522
- A quick stop?
- A quick stop.

443

Stop! Stop!

00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:06,121
Can you take me to Uzlovaya?
I missed my train.

456
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,461
- Have you heard the news?
- Yes.

457
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,176
Damn it!

458
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,910
I haven't slept for two days.

459
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,818
What can you do!

460
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,291
Here, crank it.

461
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:09,315
What a truck.
We're the same age.

462
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:17,656
My son's on the front.
Field Post Office 1 39.

463
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,365
Have you heard of it?

464
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,665
No.

465
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:04,438
Don't fret, little fellow.
We'll get there in time.

466
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,192
- Stay back, soldier!
- This is my train!

467
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,265
You're mistaken.
Where are you going?

468
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,823
- To Georgievsk.
- That train left an hour and a half ago.

469
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,330
Alyosha!

470
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,330
Shura!

471
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:13,048
- Shura, you're still here.
- Yes.

472
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,615
Here, you forgot this.
- Shura, you're brilliant!

473
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:22,525
- It was my fault you didn't get back.
- Silly girl! I thought I'd never see you again.

474
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,992
Well, I waited.

475
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,423
I'm so thirsty.

476
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,900
- You still haven't had anything to drink?
- No, I was afraid I'd miss you.

477
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,129
My little Shura.

478
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,705
Well, let's go.

479
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:53,245
- Soon you'll be home.
- You, too.

480
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:01,284
Don't worry, Shura.
He'll get better.

481
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,026
Alyosha, I've never met
a fellow quite like you before.

482
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:17,963
Alyosha, who is
that handkerchief for?

483
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,706
It's a gift for my mother.

484
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,675
- Really? The soap, too?
- What soap?

485
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,215
The soap in your bag.

486
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,113
- Let's go.
- Where?

487
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,018
- I have to give it to someone.
- The soap?

488
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:37,526
Yes, I promised.
Good thing you reminded me.

489
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,557
It's not far-- Chekhov Street.

490
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,857
Is this Pavlov a friend of yours?

491
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,055
No, I don't know him at all.
We met by chance.

492
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,497
He was on his way to the front.

493
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,930
Chekhov Street.
- So close.

494
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,663
Grandma, where's building 7?

495
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,597
Right here.

496
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,876
Who are you looking for?
- The Pavlovs.

497
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,412
They're alive!

498
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,743
Are you looking
for Lizaveta Petrovna or the old man?

499
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:11,116
- Lizaveta Petrovna.
- She now lives on Semyonovskaya Street.

500
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:14,246
And the old man is at the institute, where
the people who were bombed out live.

501
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,154
- Which is closer?
- Semyonovskaya Street.

502
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,887
Mitya will take you there.

503
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,196
- Grandma, look what I found!
- Good.

504
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,426
Mitya, take these people to see
Lizaveta Petrovna.

505
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:32,332
Mitya, this man is from the front.
- He's going to miss his train. Come on.

506
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,606
Let's go.

507
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,954
- Don't touch my bubbles!
- Kid, do the Pavlovs live here?

508
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,962
- Lizaveta Petrovna.
- Over there.

509
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,877
You have to knock.
The bell doesn't work.

510
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,295
We're looking for Lizaveta Petrovna.

511
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,601
Please come in. That's me.

512
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,734
You must be--

513
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,210
I'm from the front.
I brought you a package.

514
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:52,517
Pavlov must have sent you.

515
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,180
Yes.

516
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,459
Please come in.

517
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:06,435
Excuse me for just a minute.
I'll be right back.

518
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,738
<i>Someone's here from the front</i>
<i>with a package from Pavlov.</i>

519
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,472
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>- Tell the truth.</i>

520
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,569
<i>I can't.</i>

521
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,514
<i>What's the problem?</i>
<i>At least he'll know the truth.</i>

522
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,086
<i>- I beg you!</i>
<i>- Well, fine.</i>

523
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,782
Please excuse me.

524
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,650
It's just so unexpected.

525
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,263
So, you're from the front?

526
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,023
From the front.

527
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:43,195
Your husband sent me.
He asked me to give you this.

528
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,773
- What is it?
- Soap.

529
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,641
Oh, soap.

530
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,077
Thank you.

531
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,116
Maybe you'd like some tea?
- No, we have to go.

532
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,649
- Why?
- I don't have enough time.

533
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:14,866
Tell me.

534
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,773
How is he?
- Pavlov?

535
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,541
He's fine.
He's worried about you.

536
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,006
Thank you.

537
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,447
Don't tell him
about what you've seen here.

538
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,890
Although maybe...

539
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,493
the truth is better.

540
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:50,402
Don't look at me like that.
You're still young.

541
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,143
Who are you here to see?

542
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,717
- We're looking for Pavlov.
- Vasilii Yegorovich!

543
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,715
It's for me.
Sergei sent him!

544
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,913
How is he?
- Don't worry, everything's fine.

545
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,550
Your son sent me.

546
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,989
Here, he sent you a little package.

547
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,497
- Soap!
- He's alive?

548
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,730
Of course he's alive!

549
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,536
Alive.

550
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,804
This means he's alive.

551
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,743
Thank you.

552
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:40,177
So this is a present from him.

553
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,376
Grandpa, lie down.
You're not supposed to--

554
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,886
- Is he wounded?
- Not at all. He's perfectly healthy.

555
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:51,287
What's the matter with me?
Please sit down.

556
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,457
Someone get them a little stool.

557
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:58,895
Here, sit down.
Tell me about him.

558
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,401
How's he doing there?

559
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:11,539
Well, he's a good fighter.

560
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,780
You could even say excellent.

561
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,284
Everyone respects him
for his courage.

562
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,523
He's a brave man.

563
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,626
The commander always says
we should follow Pavlov's example.

564
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,721
He's a steadfast soldier
and a true friend.

565
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,527
Everyone in the regiment loves him.

566
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,227
Yes, yes.

567
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:37,306
Even as a boy,
everyone loved my Sergei.

568
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,410
Well, we have to go.

569
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,211
Would you like some tea?

570
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:53,152
Thanks very much.
We don't have the time.

571
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:57,986
We have to go.
- Please excuse us, but he really has to go.

572
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,255
I understand. It's war.

573
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:04,026
Tell Sergei that I'm proud of him.

574
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:06,124
Everything's fine.

575
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,999
But don't tell him about this.
It's all temporary.

576
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,573
Better he not worry.

577
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:15,142
And tell him...

578
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:19,911
that Liza, his wife, is working.

579
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,584
She sends her regards
and is waiting for him.

580
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,790
I'll tell him.

581
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:37,390
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

582
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,296
Where are you going?
This is a war car.

583
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:41,768
- She's with me.
- Your wife?

584
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:42,895
- Yes.
- No.

585
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,473
Work it out first, then drag her on.

586
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,807
Citizen, you're not allowed.
It's a war car.

587
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,948
Was it really so hard
for you to say yes?

588
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,186
Alyosha, my dear,
go on without me.

589
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,347
You've already lost half a day
because of me.

590
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,755
I'll be fine by myself.
It's not far from here.

591
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:06,419
Go, Alyosha, go.

592
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,290
- Put this on.
- Why?

593
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,332
Put it on, I said!

594
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,600
Hold it.

595
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,754
Keep moving! Keep moving!

596
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,222
Let's go, let's go!

597
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,924
- What's wrong?
- Someone stepped on my coat.

598
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,788
Well, this is it, Alyosha.

599
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,830
Yes. Don't forget me, Shura.

600
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,430
Alyosha, don't be angry with me,
but I've deceived you.

601
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,261
How?

602
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,772
I don't have a fiancé.
I don't have anyone.

603
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,277
I'm going to my aunt's.

604
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,675
Please don't be angry.

605
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,743
I'm so silly, aren't I?

606
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,616
What did you do that for?

607
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,254
I was scared of you.

608
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,383
Are you scared now?

609
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,965
The train! Hurry, Alyosha, hurry!

610
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:38,806
Shura, wait! My address!

611
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,741
Write to me!
To the village of Sosnovka.

612
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,239
The village of Sosnovka! Shura!

613
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,052
I can't hear you!

614
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,193
When I told you
I didn't have anyone else,

615
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,996
I was admitting that I love you.

616
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:26,134
Why didn't you say anything?

617
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,768
You don't love me.

618
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,760
Wait, Shura.

619
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,157
I have something to tell you.

620
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,392
Let me through.

621
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,803
Let me off this train.

622
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,770
Are you traveling far, comrade?

623
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:44,615
To Sosnovka,just over the bridge.
It's about another 10 kilometers.

624
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,517
We're from the Ukraine.

625
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:50,888
We fly like birds in autumn,
not knowing where we're going.

626
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,421
Empty words.

627
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:57,192
We're going to the Urals.
Our factory is there. Our sons are there.

628
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,750
Is that thunder?

629
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:30,632
- Going home?
- Yes.

630
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,660
For long?

631
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:36,534
There was more time, but now it's just
for a night. My leave ends at dawn.

632
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,833
How awful.

633
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:44,106
A whole night at home--
you're very lucky!

634
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,375
Do you have a girlfriend?

635
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,245
Yes.

636
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:53,014
Only she's not in Sosnovka.
I lost her.

637
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,557
Save the children! The children!

638
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:19,791
Step aside, soldier.

639
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,671
- Get out of the way.
- Good-for-nothing.

640
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,550
<i>Comrades, I already told you:</i>

641
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,617
We're only taking
wounded women and children.

642
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:51,695
Everyone else will have
to stay behind and wait.

643
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:55,198
A train will be here
in exactly two hours.

644
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,602
Yes, Grandma, in two hours.

645
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,403
Two hours!

646
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,555
Have you lost your head?
Are you tired of living?

647
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,490
Friend! Take me to Sosnovka!

648
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,824
- I can't.
- It's only 10 kilometers.

649
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,397
I told you, I can't.

650
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,092
I've come from the front to see my mother.
I'll hug her and go right back.

651
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,499
And I should go to the slammer
because of you? Get off!.

652
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:04,766
To hell with you! You pig!

653
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:19,242
Girls, that was Katerina's boy,
Alyosha!

654
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,708
- Katerina's in the fields.
- Go get her-- quickly!

655
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,707
You're back, Alexei Nikolaevich.

656
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,299
Zoika.

657
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,843
I didn't recognize you.

658
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,346
Do you know where my mother is?
- In the fields.

659
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:31,884
Have a seat and rest.

660
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,852
Have a bit of tea
until Aunt Katya gets here.

661
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,856
I can't. I have to go now.
A car is waiting for me.

662
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:39,550
- Now?
- Now. Right this minute.

663
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:41,295
But what about Aunt Katya?

664
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:02,506
- She's not here. Let's go to the fields.
- They'll send me to jail!

665
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,949
- It's on the way.
- It's right nearby.

666
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,018
They're gonna get me
for this anyway. Let's go!

667
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:59,234
Alyosha!

668
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,820
You've come back, my son.
You've made your mother happy.

669
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,719
I've been waiting,
thinking about everything--

670
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,952
- How are you, Mama?
- Like everyone else.

671
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,188
I'm going through the war.
Work is hard.

672
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,560
There are no men-- all women.

673
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:00,065
My dear, you've come back.

674
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:02,669
Alyosha, have you seen Ivan?

675
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:08,403
- When is the war going to end?
- Leave him alone. He just got back.

676
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:12,305
Let's go, Alyosha.
You can have a bite to eat and rest.

677
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:16,783
- Wait, Mama. I'm in a rush.
- Where are you rushing to?

678
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,480
I have to travel on.
I'm just stopping by for a minute.

679
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,081
What do you mean, son?

680
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:28,990
- I don't understand.
- I have to go. Right now.

681
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,501
Let's just talk for a moment.

682
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,411
I wanted to fix the roof.

683
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:20,743
You've grown. You're so thin.

684
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,783
It's just from the trip.

685
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,749
You're not sick, are you, Mama?

686
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,686
I don't have time to be sick.

687
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:31,459
Are you shaving already?

688
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:35,355
Do you smoke?

689
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,968
I have to go.

690
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:49,043
I won't let you!

691
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,965
- Forgive me, Mama.
- For what, Alyosha?

692
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,195
Forgive me, Mama.

693
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,734
What's wrong, Alyosha?

694
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:22,673
I'll survive. I'll get by.
I'll wait for you to come home.

695
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,975
I didn't wait for your father,
but I'll wait for you.

696
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:36,379
Alyosha! Have you seen Ivan
on the front?

697
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:39,923
When is the war going to end?

698
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:10,557
I'll be back, Mama!

699
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:47,150
<i>That's all we have to tell you</i>
<i>about our friend Alyosha Skvortsov.</i>

700
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:51,430
<i>He could have become</i>
<i>a remarkable man.</i>

701
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:55,628
<i>He could have become a builder</i>
<i>or beautified the land with gardens.</i>

702
01:27:56,170 --> 01:28:01,472
<i>He was, and in our memory</i>
<i>will forever remain, a soldier...</i>

703
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,507
<i>a Russian soldier.</i>
