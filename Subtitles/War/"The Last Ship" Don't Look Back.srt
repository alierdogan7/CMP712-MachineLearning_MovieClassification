Welcome to the San
Diego Emergency Shelter.

2
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:12,074
Jeter: Right. Put them over there.

3
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:13,342
Keep them coming, boys!

4
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:14,677
We're up and running,

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,245
getting new customers by the truckload.

6
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:19,381
All right, let's get these boxes moving.

7
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,649
Oliver: What happened?

8
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,618
They came in the middle of the night

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,253
and took everything we had.

10
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:26,021
Ration cards, food, clothes...

11
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,890
our house.

12
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,092
Told us we had four hours to move.

13
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:31,560
Said we worked for them now.

14
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,229
- Who did?
- Marines.

15
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,631
They swapped out their
patches for California United Forces.

16
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,800
I grew up on a base.
I knew who they were.

17
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,468
I hear you, but you need to know,

18
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,703
those Marines didn't
know what they were doing.

19
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:41,904
They were fooled just like us.

20
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,706
[Crying] They took everything.

21
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,040
Don't give up hope. You hear me?

22
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,575
We'll get through this.

23
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:49,678
- We will.
- Thanks.

[Baby crying]

25
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,852
No, it's your chair. I understand.

26
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:59,488
It'll be okay. Here's what I'm gonna do.

27
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,548
I'm gonna give you some antibiotics,

28
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,949
but you got to stay off your feet.

29
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:06,419
- They're badly infected.
- Okay. Thanks, doc.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,840
Man: Your attention, please.

31
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:11,588
If you need
immediate medical assistance,

32
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,710
please raise your
hand and I'll come to you.

33
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,112
- Sorry.
- Can't help.

34
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,813
- Good luck.
- Here. Let me...

35
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,483
No more! Leave us alone!

36
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,018
You guys have done enough.

39
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,917
Tom: Mr. Castillo was
very forthcoming with details

40
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,165
on the other regional leaders...

41
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,921
Their homes, habits, security detail.

42
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,990
Jeter: We tasked a
satellite to do some early recon.

43
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,258
It's all in your packets.

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,960
Sasha: Randall Croft, New York City.

45
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,995
Lives in a penthouse, 60
floors above Park Avenue.

46
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:06,897
Gonna be tough to sneak up on him.

47
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,498
He does like to drink.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,801
That much I know to be true.

49
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,736
Most nights, you can find him
stumbling out of a pub on the West Side,

50
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:14,104
couple of hours before sunrise.

51
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:16,306
And Wilson is out on a
farm somewhere, right?

52
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:18,375
Yes, sir.50 miles south of Des Moines.

53
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:21,011
Sleeps with the windows
open. Likes the fresh air.

54
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,013
He's got dogs, but we can handle them.

55
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:24,815
Sasha: Price is the
smartest and the meanest.

56
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:25,816
Her place is a fortress.

57
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:26,950
You leave her up to me,

58
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,518
if it's all the same to you.

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,089
So, small teams, set targets,

60
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:35,525
simultaneous assault to cut
off the heads of leadership.

61
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,594
All goes right, we can
expect limited casualties.

62
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,430
So in one fell swoop, we
take out all three leaders?

63
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:44,067
Four. We need to take
out the mastermind.

64
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,403
We need to take out Shaw.

65
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:51,208
I know you're all
concerned, but just sit tight.

66
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,976
I'm sure Castillo has an explanation

67
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,511
as to why the train hasn't arrived.

68
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:57,047
Or why he isn't
answering any of our calls!

69
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,682
Something's going on, Allison.

70
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,885
Yeah, he's stealing Beatty's
livestock is what's going on.

71
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,321
Our livestock, for Christ sakes.

72
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:08,659
My sources are telling me
this was not Castillo's doing.

73
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,927
That train was attacked.

74
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,698
And how it was taken out,
it was no small rebel hit.

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,133
Yeah, well, if that's the case

76
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,734
and a revolution starts out west,

77
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:20,337
then we're gonna have a
real shit sandwich on our plates.

78
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:23,140
And if Castillo falls, who
takes over his region?

79
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,275
Stop, all of you. I will handle this.

80
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,611
Like you've handled it before?

81
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,878
Once my people come back with
answers about the train,

82
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:32,329
we will decide the best
way to proceed... together.

83
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:36,386
Get them started. ‭All
right, I'll let them know.

84
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:37,621
Have you found them yet?

85
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:39,847
We think they're somewhere
off the coast of San Diego, but we...

86
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,025
I'm not talking
about Nathan James, Powell.

87
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:46,363
No. We haven't found them yet.

88
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:49,199
Keep looking.

89
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,405
Last time she checked in,

90
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,307
they were splitting from
Chandler's family.

91
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,975
I'm sure Mom found a good place

92
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,744
for them to lie low with the baby.

93
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:02,546
Kara, you should take Wilson.

94
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:05,782
Let me handle Shaw. You
can't let it be personal.

95
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,150
Look, this is a mission.

96
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,453
If you let your judgment
get clouded by anger or...

97
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,388
Hey, this is personal for all of us.

98
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,090
But that's not why I'm going.

99
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,524
No one knows Shaw like I do.

100
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,793
What if something happens to both of us?

101
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,261
Then Frankie will know we died

102
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:20,764
so he didn't have to grow
up in a world like this.

103
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,166
It's not gonna happen.

104

mags are in your right pocket,

00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:38,949
not the left.

Yes, ma'am.

00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:43,787

we head downrange?

00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:52,775
Danny: Jackpot. We got Wilson.

187
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:56,245
Tex: Raptor moving
in on the master suite.

188
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:12,161
- Raptor, how we doing? Damn it.

189
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,862
Price ain't here.

190
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,837
Living room clear. Approaching bedroom.

191
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,942
Clear.

192
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,544
Negative on Shaw.

193
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:30,980
Damn it! We only got two.

194
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:32,247
We'll get the others.

195
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:34,116
- Keep me updated.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,384
Cobra, where is she?

197
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:36,652
We're working on it.

198
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:39,521
There's only one other place she'd be.

199
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,058
We've got a problem. Captain
Chandler's alive.

200
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,327
We think he's the one that
stopped that train.

201
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,229
Price: We saw the ship
sink. He should be dead!

202
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,998
He will be.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,500
Our intel says he's on the
ship with Castillo in custody.

204
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,602
- So he's coming after us?
- Not if I can help it.

205
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:54,777
That's why I called you here.

206
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,338
Why me? Why not Croft or Wilson?

207
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,740
You really want Croft or Wilson

208
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,742
with their fingers on
the button, Roberta?

209
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:04,146
Why, you sneaky little so-and-so.

210
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,782
You sold them out.

211
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:08,283
[Beeping]

212
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:09,885
We're ready.

213
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:13,889
This time, I want a
more failsafe solution.

214
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:15,190
[Beeps]

215
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:17,593
What have we got? Nuclear weapons?

216
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,295
Oh, Jesus, Roberta,
we're talking about California.

217
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,497
I'm not that cynical.

218
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,699
Well, you'll have to excuse me

219
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,533
for not giving you the
benefit of the doubt.

220
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,673
Nukes are too messy. We
have something more reliable.

221
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,153
We're gonna find the Nathan James,

222
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:31,306
we're gonna hit it, and
we're gonna watch Chandler die.

[Knock on door]

225
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:48,090
Wilson and Croft have
been secured in local prisons.

226
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,356
And the others?

227
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,926
Satellite feeds picked up

228
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,694
Price's jet touching down in St. Louis.

229
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,497
Our guess is she's headed to
the White House to meet with Shaw.

230
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:58,167
I've diverted all
teams to that location.

231
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,601
Once we have them in custody,

232
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:02,004
we'll get you on the
air to address the people.

233
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,906
And say what?

234
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,841
We got Castillo's man to stand down,

235
00:11:05,843 --> 00:11:08,710
but what if the other
generals aren't so easily convinced?

236
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:10,012
We could start a civil war.

237
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,147
The rank and file will fall in line.

238
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,083
They've just forgotten who they are.

239
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:15,350
Who's gonna remind them?

240
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,219
You put a suicidal mission in office,

241
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:18,587
and I took advantage of it.

242
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,223
We are public
enemies number one and two.

243
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:22,691
The people don't trust us.

244
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:25,160
That's because they've been poisoned.

245
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:26,795
We'll change their minds.

246
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:29,965
You know,

247
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:32,668
before the quarantine
was in place in St. Louis,

248
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,639
it was just me and
115 people in a Costco.

249
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:39,608
But I was able to protect them,

250
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,578
because they wanted more
than anything to be there.

251
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,815
Not like those broken
people we saw in that shelter.

252
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:49,585
Back then, ‭the
people wanted to fight.

Nothing on subsurface.

277
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:01,690
SPY didn't pick it up until
it was practically on top of us.

278
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,091
Radar is detecting no aircraft.

279
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,693
Could the missile have been loitering?

280
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,028
We would've spotted it sooner.

281
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,130
I saw something on
radar, just for a second,

282
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:09,998
but then it just... Disappeared.

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,935

- Pieces are breaking apart.

Man: Negative. We have no
relay yet on the signature.

285
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:19,128

as Tiger and Raptor teams land.

Sir, we can't wait. Cobra
team should move in now.

I'm not sending Cobra
team in without backup.

take care of her guards.

00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:54,822
I narrowed it down to two.

Analyzing bandwidth usage now.

- Nice shooting.
- Satellite confirmed.

F31... NORAD I.D. 58763.

TAO, sector SPY in that direction.

00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,844
Ready an eagle, fire on my command.

essential systems only.

00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,041
Chill water to SPY is down,

346
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:48,876

minutes to get it up and running.

Yeah, maybe, if we fill the
service tanks with low-grade fuel.

353
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:04,658
But we can only sustain
it for a few minutes

354
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,093
before damaging the engine.

355
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,895
Do it.

356
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:11,132
Align fuel valves from
storage tank three to service!

357
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,167
Bypass the purifier!

358
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:15,536
I need cans of unfiltered fuel now!

359
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,739
- Yes, sir!
- O'Connor!

360
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:20,474
Still working, ma'am!

361
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,476
Work faster!

362
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:25,246
Adding fuel! Give me 10 seconds!

363
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:28,382
Man: No, no, no. Go
ahead. Just cycle it again.

364
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,284
CIC, engine room.

365
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,853
Fuel systems aligned, engines
in battle override.

366
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:33,721
Sealed!

367
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:35,256
Throttle engines.

368
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:38,626
Bridge, throttle engines and
circle back over the wake.

369
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,765
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

370
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:45,713
We lost visual.

371
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,803
The Nathan James is using
smoke to mask their location.

372
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,638
Well, then aim at the smoke.
You're bound to hit something.

373
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,773
It ain't that easy. I'm working on it.

374
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:56,677
Tom: Where's my fire control, radar?

375
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,513
Sir, the pipes are badly damaged.

376
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,015
We're gonna have to
cut the water supply.

377
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:02,349
How long?

378
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:05,986
An hour before we can
get SPY up and running.

379
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:20,534
Cobra team, we are still under attack

380
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:22,470
and have lost fire control.

381
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,039
The only way to stop the
UAV is to take the White House.

382
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,775
Can you breach without backup?

383
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,421
We can do it. ‭We
found their weak spot.

384
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:42,289
We'll radio when it's done.

385
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,927
Roger. Out.

386
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:56,103
Set EMCON. Condition alpha.

[Silenced gunshots, men
groan, knock on glass]

389
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:26,745
The harpoons are radar trackers,
and the ship's gone to EMCON.

390
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:28,580
Can you kill them or not, Colonel?

391
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:30,248
Just hang on.

392
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,951
[Alarm sounding, excited chatter]

393
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,921
Sir, we've got less than three minutes

394
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,923
until the engines are shot.

395
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:41,026
Once those doors open,
there's no turning back.

396
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:44,196
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

397
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,932
[Elevator bell dings]

398

Man: Shots fired! Shots fired!

400
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:56,975
Multiple tangos! Shots fired!

401
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,543
Aah!

402
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:01,480
- Crash!
- East hallway!

[Men yell]

404

This way! Through here!

406
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,400
Unh!

407
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:22,834
Take care of that!

408
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:24,336
Call in backup if you need to.

409
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,805
Sir, the engines are overheating.

410
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,840
We've got to shut them down.

411
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:30,609
Chief, once we spot a bogey,

412
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:33,211
you'll only have 5
seconds to take it out.

413
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,080
Yes, sir.

414
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:36,748
We got what we need. We should go!

415
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,949
Not yet!

416
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:41,153
I got a target! ‭Then fire!

417

Bogey inbound, bearing 096.

Fire CIWS down that bearing!

Help me.

430
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,583
It's on auto-fire. They've
already launched.

- Inbound hostile, bearing 082!
- Second bogey, bearing 036!

- Third hostile, bearing 042!
- Fire, fire, fire!

- Distance 5 mikes and closing!
- Give me a read! Give me a read!

CIWS mount 2-1 is out of ammo.

That UAV's got at
least two missiles left.

Come on, Sasha.

437
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:24,856
Sir, it's gone quiet.

438
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,391
Detecting no inbound threats.

439
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:28,693
Picking up something on subsurface.

440
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:30,295
An impact on the water.

441
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,897
It's too big to be a missile.

442
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,465
It's got to be the UAV.

443
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,369
Man: They're in here!

her, and they're probably not

need to get out of here.

You touch my son or my daughter,

496

I will hunt you
down and I will kill you.

come up with a few different options.

503
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:16,648
- They still need work but...
- I don't want options.

504

I want my kids back.

00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,192
Ashley...

532
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,227
are you okay?

533
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:49,530
It's not mine.

534
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:55,169
They killed Grandpa.

535
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:09,483
Kara's gonna take
you. You'll be all right.

536
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,921
Come on, guys. Let's go. Okay.

537
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,024
- Daddy, what about you?
- [Sharply] Ashley.

538
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:19,560
Okay. We got to go. Come on.

539
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:29,636
You too.

540
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,208
Be safe, Commodore.

541
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:46,520
All right, move the trucks!

542
00:28:46,522 --> 00:28:50,124
Move them! Move them!

543
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:55,362
[Engine starts, tires screech]

544
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,792
Where are we going?

545
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:25,793
It's a big world.

546
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:27,528
There are a lot of nice places.

547
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:33,700
And when we get there, you kill me.

548
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,836
That is the plan, yes.

549
00:29:58,394 --> 00:29:59,726
Now?

550
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:01,762
Not yet.

551
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:07,835
Mike: Corporal!

552
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:11,071
The CNO of the United
States is on that plane.

553
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:13,407
- Your CNO.
- Don't listen to him.

554
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:16,176
Mike: As long as you
wear those uniforms,

555
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:19,146
you're sworn to protect the Constitution
from all enemies,

556
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:20,647
foreign and domestic.

557
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,850
The woman on that plane is the enemy.

558
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:24,084
You know that!

559
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,352
That's enough, Captain!

560
00:30:25,354 --> 00:30:27,121
You were all lied to.

561
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:30,657
America didn't go away just
because four people said so.

562
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,527
Don't listen to him! He's the enemy!

563
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:36,730
It's not too late to
choose the right side!

564
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:41,768
Surrender now. Lay down your arms.

565
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,203
Join us.

566
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:46,740
No one's joining anyone!
Keep those weapons up!

567
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:52,746
Killing Michener.

568
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:54,982
Was that always part of the plan?

569
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,450
No, that was your fault.

570
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,819
If you'd just stayed on
the plane in Hong Kong,

571
00:30:58,821 --> 00:30:59,820
he would've folded.

572
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:02,623
He died because he believed in you.

573
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:06,326
And because he didn't
learn the lessons of the plague.

574
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,187
Which are?

575
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,763
There are winners and there are losers.

576
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,298
If you want to win, you have to fight.

577
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,302
I suppose that's one
way of looking at it.

578
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:17,905
It's the only way to
look at it, Captain.

579
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:20,574
I come from a small
town. Everybody knew everyone.

580
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,442
People left their doors unlocked.

581
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:24,044
Until the virus came,

582
00:31:24,046 --> 00:31:27,181
and they tore each other
apart to stay alive.

583
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:28,682
The man who ran the safe zone,

584
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:31,351
he locked my sister and
my nephew and my mother out,

585
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:34,788
not because they were sick...

586
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,892
but because he wanted
more food for himself.

587
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:40,561
And then the virus did come,

588
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,397
and, one by one, I watched them die.

589
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:52,773
He killed them, so I killed him.

590
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:56,510
And since then, we've
been doing things my way.

591
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,512
I make the choices.

592
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:00,914
[Door opens]

593
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:06,386
- [Gunshots]
- Now!

594
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,256
Ugh!

595
00:32:10,726 --> 00:32:12,492
Shit.

596
00:32:12,494 --> 00:32:14,428
- Your six!
- Aah!

597
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,100
[Panting]

598
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:21,835
You hear that?

599
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:27,341
Either way, it's over.

600
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,976
Get up.

601
00:32:35,517 --> 00:32:38,452
Tex: Don't do it, Commodore.

602
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:42,055
I know what you're thinking.

603
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,027
She's not worth it.

604
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,773
It's not who you are.

605
00:33:03,512 --> 00:33:06,580
- Aw, shit.
- Tex.

606
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,081
Tex!

607
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:12,753
Tex.

608
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:14,388
[Grunts]

609
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:21,962
You're a good man.

610
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,400
[Exhales slowly]

611
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:40,580
You're an American, Colonel.

612
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:42,449
Stand down.

613
00:34:36,939 --> 00:34:39,573
Go ahead.

614
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:42,409
Take me away. It won't matter.

615
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,511
Somebody else will take my place,

616
00:34:44,513 --> 00:34:46,947
somebody who sees the
world for what it is

617
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,815
and seizes the opportunity.

618
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:51,051
The people are too wounded and scared

619
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:52,285
to think for themselves.

620
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:54,087
Today they follow you, but tomorrow,

621
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,757
they will find another
golden calf to worship.

622
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,625
That much I've learned.

623
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:00,694
Are you so naive?

624
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:03,930
Captain, ‭you didn't save the world.

625
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:06,099
You unleashed the worst in human nature.

626
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:07,768
You really want to save the people,

627
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,136
you need to terrorize them.

628
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:10,937
You need to take them by
the neck and shake them.

629
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:13,473
You need to be more terrible
so that they don't have to be,

630
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,342
and deep down
inside, you know it's true.

631
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:17,010
The America you believe in is gone!

632
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:18,512
[Gunshot]

633
00:35:32,428 --> 00:35:34,494
[Door motor whirs]

634
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:36,663
[Exhales sharply]

635
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:36,837
I didn't have to kill her.

636
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:41,341
She's responsible for
what happened in Asia.

637
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:43,877
She took your kids, killed your father.

638
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:47,514
I stood... on this ship...

639
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:52,653
and lectured Rachel on the rule of law.

640
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:55,856
You're just as human as the rest of us.

641
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:58,759
I have to hold
myself to a higher standard.

642
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:06,333
Shaw was right about one thing.

643
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:11,071
This country has lost its moral compass.

644
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:17,111
It needs someone to guide it.

645
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:21,949
Get it back to its core values.

646
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,255
I can't be that person.

647
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:29,323
Tom...

648
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,402
[Indistinct conversation]

649
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:46,907
Danny?

650
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:50,844
There's somebody here
who wants to meet you.

651
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:58,619
Kara: He was a little
restless on the way over.

652
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:02,222
I think he knew he
was meeting his daddy.

653
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:04,057
[Chuckles]

654
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:07,861
You want to hold him?

655
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,063
Yeah.

656
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:13,367
Hey.

657
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:15,435
Look at you.

658
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,404
Hey, little man.

659
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:20,374
Already flex his muscles. [Chuckles]

660
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:22,843
Oh, wow.

661
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,047
[Baby fusses]

662
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:28,515
It's so nice to finally meet you.

663
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:59,046
Tom, you can't just walk away.

664
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,615
We have too much left to do.

665
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,852
It's Slattery's ship now.

666
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,386
And he's got you.

667
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,489
That crew out there needs you.

668
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:12,125
Kathleen needs you.

669
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:13,493
She's been crying all night.

670
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:15,529
You haven't even gone to talk to her.

671
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,397
What am I supposed to say?

672
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,833
Which speech am I
supposed to give, Sasha?

673
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:22,402
The one about the "casualties of war"?

674
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:25,739
Or the one about a
hero dying for the cause,

675
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:30,577
like the ones I gave for
Mason and Cossetti, Cruz,

676
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:35,015
Chung... Frankie, Ravit...

677
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:40,387
Rachel.

678
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:48,729
I wasn't there for
her when she needed me.

679
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:52,499
I wasn't there for Darien,
I wasn't there for my kids,

680
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:54,268
for my father...

681
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,670
Whatever you think is
broken, we can fix it.

00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,440
Put on your uniform.

684
00:40:55,431 --> 00:41:00,033
I speak to you today a humbled man.

685
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:02,202
I've made mistakes.

686
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:05,405
I was silent when I
should have spoken out.

687
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:09,843
I ran when I should
have stood and fought.

[Boatswain's whistle blows]

689
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:17,718
But in adversity, we
find strength and courage.

690
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,855
The great Naval Captain Nimitz once said

691
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:26,426
"God grant me the courage not
to give up what I think is right,

692
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:30,998
even though I think it hopeless."

693
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,700
Stand with me.

694
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,036
Fight with me.

695
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:40,007
Because together, we can move forward.

696
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:46,480
Together, we can be strong again.
