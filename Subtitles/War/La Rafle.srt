1
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,037
All events in this film,
even the most extreme,

2
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,123
truly occurred in Summer 1942.

3
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,686
6th JUNE, 1942

4
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,669
No Jews - By Order

5
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,920
Hi, Raymond.

6
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,882
Weismann.
What are you doing there?

7
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,550
Can I go to school with you?

8
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,969
The star, is that right?

9
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:41,971
What's the problem?

10
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,890
We're Jewish, aren't we?

11
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,558
And proud of it, too!

12
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,767
Come on.

13
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,532
How about that!

14
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,993
They seemed like such good kids.

15
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,330
At least now
we won't get them mixed up.

16
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,961
Field Marshal,

17
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,963
here we are!

18
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:20,092
Facing you, the savior of France

19
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,430
We swear, we're your men

20
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,183
We're here to serve and follow you

21
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,686
You could've waited for me.

22
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,023
Mum insisted on walking
my brother and me to school.

23
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,901
You've given us new hope

24
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,695
The nation will be reborn

25
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,492
Field Marshal, here we are!

26
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,745
Right, the first one of you
to mention that blasted star

27
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,288
gets his arse kicked.
Clear?

28
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,331
Yes, sir!

29
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,540
File in, two by two.

30
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,042
In silence, please!

31
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,961
C'mon, lads.

32
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,098
When surgery can do nothing,
as with the faces

33
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,599
of these Great War vets,

34
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,394
a facial prosthesis can be fitted.

35
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,770
This technique...

36
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,398
Stand up, ladies!

37
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,987
Please sit down.

38
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,572
Now then, ladies...

39
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,616
You may have been told that Jews

40
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:30,079
have pointy ears, hooked noses
and goodness knows what else...

41
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,872
Curtains, please.

42
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,131
As you can see, your fellow students
look just like you.

43
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,718
That's why
you will help Esther and Sarah

44
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,096
to escape through the courtyard
if the Germans arrive.

45
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,140
I'm relying on you.

46
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,809
Thank you, ladies.

47
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,147
100,000, Field Marshal.

48
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,817
Vichy, unoccupied France

49
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,318
How many did you say?

50
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,738
100,000 Jews.
Foreigners, most of them.

51
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,866
Even so, that's rather a lot.

52
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,870
How many Israelites
do we have in our own camps?

53
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,498
10,000. The advantage
is that they're foreign Jews.

54
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,459
If the Germans
take back the scum

55
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,462
that's fled here since '33,
I've no objection.

56
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,838
Neither do I, obviously.

57
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,090
But...

58
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,968
10,000 falls a long way short.

59
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,762
Offer them to the Germans, though.

60
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,013
I have.

61
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,681
Just in Paris,

62
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,100
over half the Israelites
are French nationals.

63
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,312
Not to mention their children,
all born in France.

64
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,897
The Germans
won't take the children.

65
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,190
Won't they?

66
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,775
Not for now.

67
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,070
What are we supposed
to do with them?

68
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,866
- Hello, Violette.
- Hello, children.

69
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,788
- You coming, Simon?
- Yes.

70
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,009
- Hi, Tati!
- The terrible twosome's back!

71
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,221
Hands off my radio, you!

72
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,388
Don't worry.

73
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,975
Evening, Ida.

74
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,393
- Good evening, children.
- Evening, Captain.

75
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,728
Hi there.

76
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,105
How's my little tiger?

77
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,064
Hi, Mum.

78
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,483
You're all sweaty.

79
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,652
Look...

80
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,739
Top of the class again.

81
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,033
What have you forgotten, Simon?

82
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,086
Can I go with him, Mum?
Please, can I?

83
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,213
Don't be late.
School's not finished.

84
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,799
- Okay. Thanks.
- You have homework to do.

85
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,926
- Hi, Dad.
- Don't forget my tobacco!

86
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,136
Don't worry.

87
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,973
That was André Claveau
and his Orchestra.

88
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,850
Now the racing results.

89
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,727
At Auteuil, the Princes' Handicap

90
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,646
was won by Isaac.

91
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,566
The horse's name,
not the jockey's, of course.

92
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,860
Now they wear yellow stars,
it's a shock

93
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,154
to see Paris crawling with Jews.

94
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,655
Hard-working Jews!

95
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,199
In Montmartre,
I counted 268 yellow stars.

96
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,703
A victim of its own generosity,
France has been swamped.

97
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:18,956
Sura!

98
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,082
Which means?

99
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,085
Explode with an onion up your arse!

100
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,513
That's the third time this week.

101
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,057
Put a sock in it!
We have a job for you.

102
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,936
What kind? Hope it's nothing like
the last one...

103
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,940
When a viscount
meets another viscount

104
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,111
What do they say?
"Viscount, how are you today?"

105
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,781
When a marquis
meets another marquis

106
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,660
What do they say?
"Marquis, how are you today?"

107
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,752
Come on, Nono, let's go!

108
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,712
It's just some little Jewish scamps.

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,214
Wait for me, lads!

110
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,049
Don't be so mean!

111
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,518
- Tomorrow, we'll try a posh area.
- What's "posh"?

112
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,187
Rich, you mug.

113
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,314
The rich leave a long stub.

114
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,107
We'll visit the Eiffel Tower,
at last.

115
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,108
What's that?

116
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,945
Remember that exhibition?
"The Jews in France"?

117
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,071
What a load of shit!

118
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,198
It's not even scientific.

119
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,117
- Looking at your profile...
- What about my profile?

120
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,369
It makes you wonder.

121
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,787
Very funny.

122
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,915
What was that stink at the bistro?

123
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,417
Their sauerkraut.
It's chock-full of pork.

124
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,212
Germans don't eat kosher?

125
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,841
It's dark in here!

126
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,844
We'll die of suffocation!

127
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,763
I'm late for my customers.

128
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,181
Who are they for?

129
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,683
The Traubes.

130
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,436
Some people have such lovely things.

131
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,313
Look at Renée's blouse!

132
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,732
Hands off, you!

133
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,944
Titanic's on at the Gaumont.

134
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,406
You know Hitler blames
the Titanic sinking on us?

135
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,449
Really?

136
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,410
Iceberg.
Another damn Jew!

137
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,998
- How can you joke about it?
- Rachel, my girl...

138
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,376
Read me Gone With The Wind
instead of grumbling.

139
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,252
Rachel!

140
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,920
You'll only cry again.

141
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,797
It's good to cry
if it's not for real.

142
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,595
I've got a head this big
and I hate Jews.

143
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,890
Jews won't be laughing for long.

144
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,228
With this prophecy,
I will have the last word.

145
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:50,190
They will disappear
from the face of the earth,

146
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,153
annihilated and obliterated!

147
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,504
We must hurry, Himmler.

148
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,342
Before the international community
starts an outcry.

149
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,886
Have you read Sun Tzu?

150
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,764
The Art of War.

151
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,475
Remind me to give it to you.

152
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,484
Everything is taking place

153
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,695
as I described in Mein Kampf.

154
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,864
Page 771, mein Führer.

155
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,954
They must learn
to take me at my word.

156
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,213
Mr. Jacques first, by the church.

157
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,339
We've done him.

158
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,132
And those loaves...

159
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,967
Go on, scram!

160
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,387
This isn't a circus!
It's a respectable business!

161
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,139
Why doesn't the baker want Jews
in her shop?

162
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,558
Because she only likes barb-aryans!

163
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,894
- What's going on?
- Get lost!

164
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,022
Thank you!
Pancakes, yummy!

165
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:19,822
Simon!

166
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,950
Hello, Father.

167
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,494
Hello, boys.

168
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,220
The Nazis and collaborators
forget something.

169
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,181
Why did you call him "father",
the man in black?

170
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,933
What's that?

171
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,893
Their Christ was a Jew!

172
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,604
- You're joking?
- He was some kind of rabbi.

173
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,565
And they don't know?

174
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,609
Why'd you call that man "father"?

175
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,237
If he came back today,
their Christ,

176
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,530
he'd be wearing a star.

177
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,449
Blow me down!

178
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:07,202
The man in black isn't your father.
And that's all!

179
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,875
31 Avenue Foch, Paris. Gestapo HQ

180
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,168
It's too premature.

181
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,420
You promised
to hand over your Jews.

182
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,005
I promised nothing.

183
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,549
- I said...
- What's wrong, Bousquet?

184
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,094
- I said I'd talk to my superiors.
- That's a joke.

185
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,097
Don't let your resolve weaken
so close to our goal.

186
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,183
Must we bring troops from the front

187
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,601
to do the job ourselves?

188
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,602
You couldn't!

189
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,356
- You imagine refusing?
- I didn't say that.

190
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,818
- 100,000 Jews is too many.
- 20,000 isn't enough.

191
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,364
The Führer would not understand
if you refused to cooperate.

192
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,159
He'd interpret it as provocation.

193
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,453
An insult.

194
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,830
Look,

195
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,916
you empty it out like this.

196
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,959
Careful you don't make a mess.

197
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,256
Sura, did you see my rolling papers?

198
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,343
No, that's not the tobacco.

199
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,886
It's the solvents, the paint.

200
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,221
My papers, darling?

201
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,306
In the dresser.

202
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,517
In the drawer.

203
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,311
On the right.

204
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,396
The second one.

205
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,358
You don't even know
who smoked them.

206
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,817
What if he had tuberculosis?

207
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,987
No danger of that.
I pinched them off some Germans.

208
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,032
- Great big fellas, they were.
- Bastards are fighting fit!

209
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,576
I hope they all rot from cholera.

210
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,994
Can I practice now?

211
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,331
Can I? My audition's on Monday.
Can I start?

212
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,209
I don't think Shabbat's ended.

213
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,340
One...

214
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,385
two, three...
Three stars, Sura.

215
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,095
Shabbat's ended.

216
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,513
Don't you believe me?

217
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,722
No.

218
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,266
Jo...

219
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,725
Come over here.

220
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,731
It's true, Mum, honest.

221
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,902
Go on, put your ballet shoes on.

222
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,910
Five police training schools.

223
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,662
I know what's coming.

224
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,582
Our government must reassert itself.

225
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
We need new training schools.

226
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,627
No more paramilitary police.

227
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,590
- No more Police for Jewish Affairs.
- Darquier'll be pleased.

228
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,300
His militiamen are exemplary.

229
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,342
They're thugs.

230
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,344
- Rabble.
- Who do the dirty work.

231
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,138
They don't have the file of Jews.

232
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,764
We have it.

233
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,940
Can't you change the music?

234
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,402
I like Chopin.

235
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,322
He was Jewish, wasn't he?

236
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,533
Sura, not all geniuses are Jews.

237
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,880
I'll get you!

238
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:06,882
Stop that.

239
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,925
I have a suggestion.

240
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,637
We organize everything.

241
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,931
But you restore
our police's authority.

242
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,350
If all goes to plan,

243
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,061
I promise
the Führer will listen favorably.

244
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,207
Vanda Lesniak.

245
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,172
Sarah Landeau.

246
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,844
Annette Monod.

247
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,686
Lucienne Dufresnes.

248
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,507
Goodbye!

249
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,134
Have a good holiday!

250
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,559
Look, Mum, I won the prize!

251
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,855
That's wonderful, love.

252
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:46,690
What's wrong?

253
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,026
Come on, let's go home.

254
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,787
We'll pay for private lessons
with Prof. Grunstein.

255
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,498
He's banned, too.
That way, you keep your teacher.

256
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,459
Dad, private lessons are expensive!

257
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,377
So? I'm not a cripple, am I?

258
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,379
Listen and remember this forever.

259
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,632
They can ban you,
but they can't ban your talent.

260
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,260
The war will end one day.
All wars do.

261
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,387
- We must leave right now.
- And go where?

262
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,597
The Ritz?

263
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,183
They're dismissing Jews
from universities,

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,310
the civil service...
Everywhere, Dad.

265
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,936
The nursery school head...

266
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,188
she's been fired.

267
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,608
Have you read the papers?
Have you seen what they call us?

268
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,486
"Undesirables". That's what.
What more do you need?

269
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,737
How can 5 of us get out?

270
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,531
How can we cross the border?
With what money?

271
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,076
Mr. Finkel and his wife
tried to make it to Spain.

272
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,787
Now where are they?

273
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,914
At Drancy internment camp.
You want that?

274
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,791
Do you?

275
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,754
"9th decree of 8th July, 1942,

276
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,256
"concerning measures
against the Jews.

277
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,887
"It is forbidden for Jews to frequent
establishments open to the public. "

278
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,680
What does that mean?

279
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,641
I'll tell you what it means.

280
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,602
We're banned from cafés,
restaurants,

281
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,312
concerts, libraries,

282
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,772
fairgrounds...

283
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,483
They should say where we can go.
It'd save ink.

284
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,819
What do you think?

285
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,196
I preferred things
the way they were.

286
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,076
"Restrictions on entering
shops and businesses... "

287
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,539
Honestly, Laval, you've read it too.

288
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,333
"France is not yet
sufficiently anti-Semitic

289
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,837
"to accept
the mass deportation of Jews. "

290
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,005
Who wrote this report?

291
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,634
- The secret services.
- I always said...

292
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,885
France isn't ready.

293
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,098
Police stations are swamped
with denunciations. Overrun.

294
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,434
We can't deport French-born Jews.

295
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,978
The country won't accept it.

296
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,940
Let's turn it to our advantage.

297
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,526
We'll deport the stateless ones.

298
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,905
Personally, I'd feel no dishonor
in deporting them

299
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,825
to Germany's territories for Jews
in the East.

300
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,827
In the East?

301
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,328
East of what?

302
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,415
Any mass deportation
would cost me power.

303
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,669
I see.

304
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,090
I'll deliver your answer in person.

305
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,926
In the negative.

306
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,436
I knew we'd reach agreement.

307
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,315
Let's recapitulate.

308
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,651
You start by sending us 10,000 Jews

309
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,612
from your camps
in the southern zone.

310
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,114
In the occupied zone,
your police do the job...

311
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,365
Under French command.

312
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,702
24000 Jews in the Paris region.
That's the quota.

313
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,623
Only stateless persons
will be arrested. Austrians, Czechs,

314
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,750
Russians, Germans and Poles.

315
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,044
We'll leave you
the children until...

316
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,045
Impossible!

317
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,839
Our social services couldn't cope.

318
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,634
Children should go
with their parents.

319
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,430
We'll have to refer that to Berlin.

320
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,186
No Jews - By Order

321
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,359
Just watch what happens.

322
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,277
I knew it.

323
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,531
You should know the law.

324
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,200
You, too.

325
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:26,910
You have children here?

326
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,495
Of course.

327
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,206
Count yourselves lucky
I don't arrest you.

328
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:32,958
People end up in Drancy for less.

329
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,961
And don't forget,
curfew for Israelites at 8 PM.

330
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,587
8PM's early in summer.

331
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,214
I don't make the law.

332
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,674
Boys!

333
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,634
Nono, we're going.

334
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,886
You're going already?

335
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,097
I'm going to have a baby.

336
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,350
Your Mummy is.
You'll have a brother or sister.

337
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,602
No, it'll be a baby.

338
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,312
The doctor said so!

339
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,275
Nowadays,
you don't want to be having babies.

340
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,945
If these ladies are going,
so are we. Lucien?

341
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,744
It's silly that you have to leave.

342
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,542
It's outrageous,
how they treat you.

343
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,628
My husband made it to the free zone.

344
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,880
But I've had no news in 2 weeks.

345
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,010
I don't know how you do it,
all alone with four children.

346
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:26,886
Are you the new tenants?

347
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,140
We just moved in next door.
We're from the Marne.

348
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,017
My husband works
at Les Halles market.

349
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,519
Shall we go for coffee?

350
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,565
Aren't you forgetting something?

351
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,816
Afternoon, Mrs. Traube.

352
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,609
Good afternoon, Sura.

353
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,153
Ladies.

354
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,573
I have some laundry for you
to come and pick up.

355
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,741
Thank you.

356
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,075
Good afternoon, sir.

357
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,535
You're not in school today?

358
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,163
Not any more,
like all Jewish teachers.

359
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,832
I give German lessons
to students now.

360
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,083
Enjoy your walk.

361
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,126
Thank you.

362
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:01,963
What?

363
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,173
What what?

364
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,924
What were you laughing at?

365
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,342
I wasn't laughing.

366
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,677
Hark at him.

367
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,105
In the end,
it's proving easier with the French

368
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,025
than the Duce
or that blasted Franco.

369
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,862
Film the young people, not me.

370
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,655
You're much younger than them.

371
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,953
Spain fights
for every one of its Jews.

372
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,456
Mediterraneans,
so over-emotional!

373
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,708
Romantics.

374
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,877
That's why we dominate them.

375
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,965
Herr Hitler, can we go
and see the deer?

376
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,468
Of course you can, sweetheart.

377
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:55,183
We'll give them
some bread soaked in milk.

378
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,400
Fast and with utmost discretion.

379
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,194
Night and fog.

380
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,908
A total of 5000 men.

381
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,702
Including 4,500 gendarmes,
Mr. Secretary General,

382
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,205
and 200 plain-clothes
secret servicemen.

383
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,290
Not forgetting 1000 militiamen,

384
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,708
all highly motivated.

385
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,587
If my calculations are correct,
that's one armed man

386
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,214
for every four or five Jews.

387
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,716
We should net 24-25000.

388
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:33,513
Of whom three-quarters are women,
children and pensioners.

389
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,849
That shouldn't be any problem.

390
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,600
To reach the quota you set,

391
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,645
we'll have to strip a few thousand
of French citizenship.

392
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,105
Isn't that so, Leguay?

393
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:45,483
So it looks legal, we only arrest
foreigners or stateless persons.

394
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,443
We're taking care of it.

395
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,821
Let's say the 14th of July.

396
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,491
Be serious. It's our
national holiday, Bastille Day.

397
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,202
In that case, the 16th.

398
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,205
They've got out
the file of the Jews.

399
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,539
Evening, Tati.

400
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,916
Evening, son.

401
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,044
Thousands of people listed.

402
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,795
It'll be any time now.

403
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,381
It's nice of you to warn us, Dédé.

404
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,470
Give my love to Momone!

405
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,060
I heard they'll take children
this time.

406
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,561
You're mad, my girl!

407
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,730
Schmuel,
tell your daughter she's mad.

408
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,232
Children?

409
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,193
Why'd they burden themselves
with children?

410
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,781
Sergeant Desnoyers
came specially to warn everybody.

411
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,742
You're talking nonsense, my girl.

412
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,703
Thousands of Jews
took refuge here like us.

413
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,247
Know what they say in Poland?

414
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,499
France is the Jews' salvation.

415
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,293
- Dad, we mustn't stay here tonight!
- It'll be like last time.

416
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,795
When was that false alarm?

417
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,383
If it makes you feel better,
I'll sleep in the workshop.

418
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,884
We're in danger, too!

419
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,136
Stop it, Rachel!
You'll scare your brother.

420
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,597
They want men
for their arms factories.

421
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,724
They won't touch us.

422
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,227
And your father's a war veteran.

423
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:47,105
I'll sleep downstairs,
for Rachel's sake.

424
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,191
Have you seen my cigarettes?

425
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,278
You just want to smoke in bed.

426
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,989
What bed?
There's just a rotten couch.

427
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,365
Full of fleas!

428
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,452
- Why didn't we go to America?
- They turn back communists.

429
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,871
You can go later. I prefer Paris.

430
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,249
Every day, I go to the Sacré Coeur
for my models,

431
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,002
and every time,
I feel my heart skipping.

432
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,131
Compared to Lublin,
France is a dreamland.

433
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,591
You never saw what Poland was like.

434
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,552
We could tell you stories.

435
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,638
Pétain's no Cossack,
whatever you say.

436
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,897
It could be a rumor,
but you never know.

437
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,691
Here's what we'll do...

438
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,068
If I hear them,
I'll come calling my cat.

439
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,237
Tati, you don't have a cat.

440
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,031
What a sweetie!

441
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,866
He's a bright one, isn't he?

442
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,286
Why did she say
she'd come calling her cat?

443
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,787
The cat's make-believe.

444
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,916
Try to delay them,
so we can get out the back.

445
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,294
- Goodnight, Bella.
- Goodnight, Tati.

446
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,257
Mum?

447
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,592
Yes?

448
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,344
I have an idea.

449
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,388
What's your idea?

450
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,682
We should get married.

451
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,727
What do we do with Dad?

452
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,771
We'll invite him.

453
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,028
Goodnight, darling.

454
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,095
You can finish tomorrow.

455
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,724
You'll teach me
to speak French good?

456
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:47,600
Right now?

457
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,520
No, I'm having lots of work to do.

458
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,105
I have.

459
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,523
I have lots of work to do.

460
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,692
Make fun of me.

461
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,778
Goodnight, darling.

462
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,535
What does that mean?

463
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,413
My little Yiddish noggin,
I think you'd say.

464
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,915
You're my little Yiddish noggin.

465
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:13,751
Goodnight, Mum.

466
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,223
To all Divisional Chiefs,

467
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,018
you will arrive
at the first address at 4 AM.

468
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,980
All listed Jews
must leave their homes immediately.

469
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,066
You will proceed swiftly
without needless chatter.

470
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,862
The ethics of the operation
are not to be debated.

471
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,824
All arrestees will be taken
to the primary detention centre,

472
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,535
whatever their state of health
or age.

473
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,163
Gas and electricity meters
will be shut off.

474
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,624
Pets will be given to the concierge,
with tenants' keys.

475
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,586
Arrestees must be in possession
of identity cards.

476
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:01,132
Each detainee is allowed one pair
of shoes, two pairs of socks,

477
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,342
two shirts, two pairs of underwear,

478
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,428
a sweater, a set of sheets,

479
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,347
a bowl, a cup, blankets...

480
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:09,932
Razors are permitted.

481
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:15,313
Moreover, detainees must take
two days' food per person.

482
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,442
You will send childless couples
and bachelors to Drancy camp.

483
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:23,905
All the others
to the Winter Velodrome.

484
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,456
Kitty! Kitty!

485
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,669
They're here! They're coming!

486
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,134
They're coming! Wake up!

487
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,511
I'll report you!

488
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,889
There are only poor folk here.
They haven't done anything!

489
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,974
Stay out of this! Back inside!

490
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,017
Go!

491
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,602
That's an order!

492
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,944
The children too?

493
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,823
- Mum!
- The children!

494
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,450
Stop! Don't hurt her!

495
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,371
They're taking the children too!

496
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,497
The children!

497
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,790
- Quiet!
- Run!

498
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:17,959
Stop!

499
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,670
They're taking the children!

500
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,423
Open up, now!

501
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,383
Run!

502
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,010
It's the Zyglers.

503
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,432
Don't hurt her!

504
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,518
Stop hurting her!

505
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,445
- Vladimir, please take the children.
- You too, Ida.

506
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,573
I can't leave my husband.

507
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,158
Children, don't make a noise.

508
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,286
I'll see you soon.

509
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,881
Where are you going?

510
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,217
Taking my brother to his nanny's.

511
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,761
- Name?
- Louise Timonier.

512
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,847
We just moved in.

513
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,645
What are you doing?

514
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,668
Let's go!

515
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,305
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep out.

516
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,765
They're Jews.

517
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:56,974
Mummy!

518
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,980
Thanks anyway.

519
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,316
Get the hell out!

520
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,197
I'm missing two from my list.

521
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,199
Louise and Léon.

522
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:15,951
Where are they, ma'am?

523
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,789
Do you honestly
expect me to tell you?

524
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,589
I won't leave!
This is my home.

525
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:55,616
Your name!

526
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,291
He fought in the Great War!

527
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,544
His Jewish comrades died for France!

528
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,462
How dare you?

529
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,687
Those are my children!

530
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,244
Murderers!

531
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,328
Excellent.

532
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,583
Only four suicides so far, sir.
And almost no fighting.

533
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,918
Yes, but how many have we got?
What time is it?

534
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,253
7.30, sir.

535
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,380
- I said, how many?
- 5000.

536
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,800
We're below target. Look lively!

537
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,266
Ida...

538
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,522
Get your paws off me!

539
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,191
Idiot!

540
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,321
Open up. Police!

541
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,115
Open it or we'll blow the lock off.

542
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,457
What are you doing?

543
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,921
A madwoman jumped with her brat.
I don't want an epidemic.

544
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,838
My God!

545
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,591
Who was it?
We know everyone here.

546
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,635
Who cares, they're dead.

547
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,970
Right, how many Jews here?

548
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,599
We've got five.

549
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,478
Sura, Charlotte, Rachel,
Joseph and...

550
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,106
Stupid dago name.

551
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,817
Schmuel Weismann.

552
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,528
- He isn't here.
- Where is he?

553
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,321
Deceased.

554
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,658
It doesn't say so here, ma'am.

555
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,827
Last week.
Embolism.

556
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,916
Just to repeat myself, you're allowed
2 days' food, clothing...

557
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,668
Hurry up!

558
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,378
Girls, help me!

559
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,967
Take warm clothes,
they'll come in handy.

560
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,469
Where are you taking us?

561
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,637
Chop chop!

562
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,473
Get some crockery.
Nothing breakable.

563
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,229
No need, you'll get them there.

564
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,023
Forget that, too.

565
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,901
You won't need it there.

566
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,782
Where's "there"?
Why won't you tell us?

567
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,577
I don't know
and I don't give a damn!

568
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,038
Quick or I'll get the Gestapo.
You'll change your tune.

569
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,792
Don't try to escape,
we have orders to shoot.

570
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,168
Move!

571
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,048
For Poor Relief.

572
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,469
Shouldn't we tell Dad?

573
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,059
That's an idea I like.

574
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,353
So, not a widow after all?

575
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,439
Hubby's embolism all cured?

576
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,024
Get the champagne!

577
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,192
What's embolism, Mum?

578
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,241
It's okay, Jo. You didn't know.

579
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,375
Gently, please!

580
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,544
She got out of hospital yesterday.

581
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,255
You think they'll hurt my teddy?

582
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,841
They can't. It's a toy.

583
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,051
I don't understand.

584
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,637
Are you okay, Mum?

585
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,931
- Are you sure?
- Not a word.

586
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,768
Otherwise, they won't let me
come with you. Not a word.

587
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,552
- Your papers!
- Leave it, Momo, she's new.

588
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,055
Mona, make any cash last night?

589
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,598
Want a jar at René's?

590
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,141
Yeah, sure...

591
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,268
This strip of a girl? A prossie?

592
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,229
With a sprog and no tits?

593
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,399
As if you don't know
how twisted you men are.

594
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,110
Come on, Mona, let's have a drink.

595
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,864
I know where we'll hide her.

596
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,866
You're the Zygler girl, aren't you?

597
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,119
We'll take her to Father Bernard.

598
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,251
And Professor Traube, where's he?

599
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,045
At Collège St. Vincent,
with his students.

600
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,673
He's an early riser for a teacher!

601
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:06,010
Those kicked out of their schools
have no choice.

602
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,597
Remind me
to send a van to St. Vincent.

603
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,560
We have a Jew to pick up.
One Saul Traube.

604
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,148
You have ten minutes.

605
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,067
Food for two days,
one small suitcase.

606
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,403
You understand French, don't you?

607
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,371
- I have my orders.
- Not orders to peep, though.

608
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,374
Run up to the attic and hide.

609
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,668
- What are you going to do?
- Warn Dad.

610
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,962
I've got to beat them there.
Take your coats.

611
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,756
They'll think you left.

612
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,053
I'll try to delay them.
Go on!

613
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,510
The little bitch!

614
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,346
Check upstairs.

615
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,038
Stop it!

616
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,971
Not so proud now, eh?

617
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,306
- Good riddance, I say.
- Shut up!

618
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,142
What'd these kids do to you?

619
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,269
Where are they taking them?

620
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,854
Jerusalem!

621
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,774
Death to Jewish vermin!

622
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,152
I'm not vermin!

623
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,653
Die!

624
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,867
Look, Mum, it's Jo!

625
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,201
Mum, grab him!

626
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,912
- We can keep him.
- I'm not allowed to.

627
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,208
Goodbye, HéIène.

628
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,503
- That's enough.
- Goodbye, Sura.

629
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,550
Goodbye, Jo.

630
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,604
If anyone escapes,

631
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,481
hostages will be chosen at random
and shot.

632
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Is that clear?

633
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,950
I'm sorry, Dad.

634
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,660
Sorry for what, son?

635
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,207
Isn’t it better,
the whole family together?

636
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,841
I'm a war veteran.
I want to know where we're going.

637
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,096
- Are we leaving France?
- On my word as an officer, no.

638
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,015
I believe you.

639
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,375
Let's face facts, we've failed.

640
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,336
With all due respect, sir,

641
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,588
13,000 people,
you call that a failure?

642
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,507
A mere 10,000 Jews missing!

643
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,676
They had accomplices.

644
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,304
To arrest more Jews,
we'll have to search Aryan homes.

645
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,726
From now on,
you must never say your old name,

646
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,855
nor your little brother's
nor other family members' names.

647
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,609
You must forget
your old address, your school,

648
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,945
your classmates...

649
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,406
You must change your date of birth,

650
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,951
your religion and everything else.
Do you see?

651
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,329
It's a question of life or death.

652
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,622
Thank you.

653
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,916
I know what you risk.

654
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,168
To fight Hitler

655
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,005
is to fight the Antichrist.

656
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,681
Excuse me,
the Winter Velodrome, please?

657
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,490
The senior doctor's expecting me.

658
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,826
I'm looking
for the consultations room.

659
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,245
- Who are you?
- Annette Monod.

660
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,996
Let go of my wife!

661
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,263
Miss! Our son has a bad fever.

662
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,973
I won't be a moment.

663
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:13,145
Can you tell us our new address?
Our children might worry.

664
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,274
We've been without water for 2 days.
Please, do something.

665
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:18,692
I'll be right back.

666
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:23,238
Where are we going?
My daughter has measles.

667
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,031
I won't be a moment.

668
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,704
Are you alone?

669
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:32,873
I beg your pardon?

670
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,416
I asked for reinforcements.

671
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:36,334
I'm sorry.

672
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,377
What's your name?

673
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:43,341
I only have 6 nurses,
including you, for 8000 people.

674
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,096
Ask Matthey Joanis at the nursery
what you can do.

675
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,807
Do you know if doctors are coming?

676
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,059
No.

677
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:58,815
I have 60 volunteers ready,
but they want no witnesses.

678
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,281
They dragged Jews from hospitals,
old folks' homes,

679
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,575
asylums even.
We have lunatics here.

680
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,912
Appendicitis cases
who'd just been operated on.

681
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,372
And the usual children's diseases.

682
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,459
Measles,
scarlet fever, chicken pox...

683
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,169
Typhoid even.

684
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,338
I never saw chaos like this.

685
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,048
And in the pharmacy?

686
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:26,968
Methylene blue.
And two stoves to sterilize syringes.

687
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:32,140
45 minutes to give an insulin jab.
On the front in '14, it was better.

688
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,351
- You were there?
- Ambulances at Verdun.

689
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,771
I lost my eye there.
But the other misses nothing.

690
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,481
Where do I begin?

691
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,192
We just received some milk.
Under-4s only.

692
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,361
There's not enough to go round.

693
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,704
I've been a good boy.

694
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,249
I'm sure you have.

695
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,543
My teacher said so.

696
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,961
I believe you.

697
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:05,048
Why can't I leave then,
if I've been a good boy?

698
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,970
I've no idea, little man.
I don't know why you're here.

699
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,596
We need to tell Mummy

700
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,224
we're waiting here for her,
me and Simon.

701
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,394
We live at number 12.

702
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,479
Number 12, fine. I'll remember.

703
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,147
You have family here?

704
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,483
Yes, my brother's outside.

705
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,693
What's your name?

706
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,904
Noé Zygler,
but you can call me Nono.

707
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,114
Okay.

708
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,493
That boy's mother

709
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:35,954
died this morning.
A hemorrhage.

710
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,373
Poor woman died
on the way to hospital.

711
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,499
The boys don't know.

712
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,299
Which is your brother?

713
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,592
I am.

714
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:53,138
- Is your father here?
- He's in the free zone.

715
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,015
At least, I think so.

716
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,059
My big sister
and little brother got away.

717
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,853
You two are all alone here?

718
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,273
We're here. Their neighbors.
They're with us.

719
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:08,445
Look, Mummy gave it to me
before she went to hospital.

720
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,363
There's her photo inside.

721
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,616
Your Mummy's very pretty.

722
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,659
When does it begin?

723
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,037
What, darling?

724
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,581
The show. The bicycle race.

725
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,084
We're the only show here, Nono.

726
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,161
- Where are you going?
- The Red Cross. Can you help?

727
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,082
- Depends.
- Leave me alone!

728
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,819
You're trying to get out?

729
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,864
Are you alone here? No family?

730
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,700
Nobody?

731
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,286
Go and see the chief plumber,
Roques.

732
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,039
He has blank permits, Ausweis.

733
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,083
He can help you.

734
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,668
Go on.
I didn't tell you.

735
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,968
He can help you, too.
Why don't you ask him?

736
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,636
Who'd look after them?

737
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,221
Come on in, madam.

738
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,562
A fine case of chicken pox.

739
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,401
I never saw so many Jews.

740
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,571
How can they hurt us?
There's too many of us.

741
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,781
It's too much work.

742
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,786
Why are we here then?

743
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,373
I know where we're going.

744
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,460
We're going to Pitchipoi!

745
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,795
Where's Pitchipoi?

746
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:32,714
Near Timbuktu.

747
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,759
Why's everything you all say
so confusing?

748
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:40,513
I heard we're being sent
to the arms factories in Poland.

749
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,682
There aren't any in Poland.

750
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,227
But there are salt mines.

751
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,896
I saw them when I was a kid.

752
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,899
You get on a little train
and go underground.

753
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,235
And you know what the workers
built in the salt? Do you?

754
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,612
Do you know?

755
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,530
What about you?

756
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,866
A cathedral. A real one.

757
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,910
In the salt.
With candelabra and pews.

758
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,079
We can build a synagogue then.

759
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,552
The doctor sent me.

760
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:23,681
You're the chief plumber?

761
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,934
Yeah.

762
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,106
I won't shake your hand.
30 blocked crappers.

763
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,068
- Who's it for?
- Me.

764
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,404
- It'll never work.
- Why not?

765
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,993
We got two Jews out today.
Two men, in our overalls.

766
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,412
With your figure...

767
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,331
They're not that stupid!

768
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,416
Give me the Ausweis anyway.

769
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,505
In my top pocket.

770
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,091
Take the pen out, too.

771
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,470
How do you spell your name?

772
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,848
Roques, with an S.

773
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,685
If anyone asks, say I'm your wife.

774
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:09,936
I can cope with that.

775
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:14,107
- Does that look okay?
- Let's hope so.

776
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,651
Now it's got my name on it.

777
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:17,610
Thanks.

778
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,863
And good luck.

779
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:22,365
Say it to them.

780
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,267
I brought my husband his lunch.
He's the chief plumber.

781
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,528
I'll go with you, just in case.

782
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,322
Hold on.

783
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,581
How do I look?

784
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,958
Full of nerve.

785
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,209
Let's go.

786
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,922
Not him!

787
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,257
- Who is he?
- He knows I'm Jewish.

788
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,428
Miss!

789
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,400
Well played.

790
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,364
Quick, before he changes his mind.

791
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,279
Little girl.

792
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,031
Thanks.

793
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,449
Here.

794
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,369
I told you.
Why'd no one listen to me?

795
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,664
Rachel, please, not in public.

796
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,459
You're always so trusting.
It's all your fault.

797
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,545
A father protects his family!

798
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,755
Rachel, be quiet.

799
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,591
Look around you.
I wasn't the only one.

800
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,135
We all trusted them.

801
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,970
Your father's right.

802
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,556
We all trusted them, all of us.

803
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:02,734
You're Protestant?

804
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:04,819
A pastor's daughter.

805
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,779
- Practicing?
- Yes.

806
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,866
I still believe.

807
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:13,953
I wanted to say...

808
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,040
I'd no idea what was going on here.

809
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,333
I never imagined this.

810
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,170
They gave you
no special instructions

811
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,172
before they sent you here?

812
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,007
Sure.

813
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,218
So, what were
their recommendations?

814
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,431
To stay silent
about what I saw here.

815
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:38,478
Not to mix with the detainees,
to keep my distance.

816
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,524
One day,
they'll be called to account.

817
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:44,442
Who?

818
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,194
The men who ordered this.

819
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,820
They'll have to pay.

820
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:01,042
You must stop your children
from gathering by the rails.

821
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,947
Firemen!

822
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,582
Water!

823
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,625
Water!

824
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,136
What do we do, sir?
There'll be a riot.

825
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,221
I wouldn't blame them.

826
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:58,558
Roll out the hoses!

827
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,185
That's an order.

828
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,213
What the hell's going on?

829
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,091
Who gave these orders?

830
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,176
I did.

831
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,179
You're here to check the hoses,
not use them!

832
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,513
I don't see a fire.

833
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,891
Roll them back up! Now!

834
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:46,272
I'm the ranking officer
in this arena.

835
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,315
Step back, Lieutenant.

836
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,193
Attention!

837
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,572
In the absence of a superior,
I'm in command.

838
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,866
And so, I confirm my orders.

839
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,117
Roll them out!

840
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,245
Fall out.

841
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,332
What you're doing is a disgrace.

842
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,672
Hooray for the firemen!

843
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,346
Please!

844
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,931
Over here!

845
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,017
Thank you.

846
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,478
Don't push!

847
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,496
Please, over here!

848
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,211
Thank you.
God bless you.

849
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:03,057
So my uncle can bring us food.

850
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,561
I've no stamps,
but I put 5 francs inside.

851
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,067
Please...

852
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,118
Hurry!

853
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,716
God bless you.

854
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,217
Thank you.

855
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,271
Gentlemen...

856
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:55,026
I noticed you taking messages
from many detainees.

857
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,028
Tomorrow,

858
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,238
don't report for duty.

859
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,199
You'll each receive a Metro ticket.

860
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:04,869
You'll go and post the messages.

861
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,415
As far away as possible,
to avoid arousing suspicion.

862
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,335
If by chance you get caught,

863
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,921
say you're acting alone,
to protect your comrades.

864
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,591
Anyway, do your best.

865
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,095
I'm proud of you.

866
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:39,528
By the way, Cardinal Suhard...
You read his letter of protest?

867
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:45,201
"We can't hush
the cries of our conscience...

868
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,162
"In the name of humanity
and Christian principles... "

869
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,167
What do we do?

870
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,543
Nothing.

871
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,962
He didn't even make it public.

872
01:01:58,298 --> 01:01:59,965
So it doesn't exist.

873
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,929
The Germans are here!

874
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,269
You bastards!

875
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,063
Scum!

876
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,779
Deaths every day,
sanitation deteriorating...

877
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,366
I have 100 volunteer doctors
waiting for a simple order.

878
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,534
Jews, I imagine.

879
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,787
All you have to do
is allow them in.

880
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,706
There's no point.
They're leaving tomorrow.

881
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:35,459
All of them. Even you.

882
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,507
Murderers!

883
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,353
It can process 8000 units per day.

884
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:58,149
As long as we finish
crematoria 2 and 3 by mid-August.

885
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,321
Ashes, Himmler.

886
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,615
We need ashes.

887
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:09,285
Ashes don't say
how many of them there were.

888
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:12,955
They don't say
if they were men, women or children.

889
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,000
Goodness, Wagner is so depressing!

890
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,751
Can't we change the music?

891
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,515
Who wants a cocktail?

892
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,267
Moi, moi, moi!

893
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,771
Eva, you know what I think
of women drinking alcohol.

894
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:42,067
I don't drink, mein Führer.
I just think up cocktails

895
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,528
and test them on Dr. Morell.

896
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,249
Come and try my latest creation.

897
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,461
For heavens' sake,
don't get so close to the fire,

898
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,797
or you'll explode
like a Molotov cocktail.

899
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,597
Dinner's in 10 minutes.
It's Sauerbraten.

900
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:15,309
If you'd seen the slaughterhouses
in the Ukraine,

901
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:18,270
and the butchers
wading through blood,

902
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:22,024
you'd soon lose your appetite
for Sauerbraten.

903
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:57,226
It's nothing,
just a touch of heatstroke.

904
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,270
Give him plenty of fluids.

905
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:05,818
Are you okay?

906
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,153
Fetch her cape.

907
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,406
You're exhausted.

908
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,158
You need to rest.

909
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,456
Are you holding up?

910
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,125
Yes, for now.

911
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:29,508
You know your destination?

912
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,928
The Loiret region detention camps.

913
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,638
Beaune or Pithiviers.

914
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,479
I'd like...

915
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,107
I'd like to go with the children.

916
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,319
I'll support your request.

917
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,070
Thank you.

918
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,284
Get some fresh air,
you're very pale.

919
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,134
Want a cigarette?

920
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,762
Thanks, I don't smoke.

921
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,730
I couldn't face that again.

922
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:28,776
Go ahead!

923
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:30,736
Resign!

924
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,780
Go on. Rebel!

925
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,490
Not one of you has.

926
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,617
Not a single one.

927
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:39,411
Is it normal,
what's going on in there?

928
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,497
They had it
coming to them perhaps?

929
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,248
It's easy for you to say.

930
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:45,709
I'm a soldier.

931
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:47,628
I could get shot.

932
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,797
- I have kids, you know.
- So do they!

933
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,257
They've got no supplies.

934
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,594
There's a grocery opposite.
Why not let them buy food?

935
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,513
I have orders.

936
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,014
Orders to starve children?

937
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,562
They're leaving already?

938
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:09,316
We're evacuating the whole stadium.

939
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,943
About time, too.

940
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,739
It's not even a real train.

941
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,699
Keep moving!

942
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,159
Keep moving!

943
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,750
That way!

944
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,440
People: 40
Horses: 8

945
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,291
See, Jo, we haven't left France

946
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,835
and we're all together.

947
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:03,240
Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp,
100 km south of Paris

948
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,803
Look, Simon, a snail!

949
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,264
Come back here.

950
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,000
It's so hot!

951
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,712
And it stinks in here.

952
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,881
Probably, the people before us.

953
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:02,883
Where are they now then?

954
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:12,935
Stop it!

955
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:20,859
You can't get away from me,
you grub.

956
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,277
Stop...

957
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,321
That tickles.

958
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:25,906
Mrs. Traube!

959
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,001
Where's Hannah?
And your husband?

960
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,836
I don't know where they are.

961
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,880
I saw your daughter.

962
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,967
- Where did you see her?
- At the stadium.

963
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,135
My God! In that case...

964
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,471
Where is she now?

965
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,723
There are other camps nearby.

966
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,684
You need to ask.

967
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,310
You'll find her.

968
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,690
I'm glad to see you again.

969
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,486
Same here.

970
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,448
He's the last one.

971
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,118
My feet are killing me.

972
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,120
All done!

973
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,916
I don't get it.

974
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,461
I heard they're going East.
With no warm clothes.

975
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:23,380
It's Autumn soon. They'll freeze.

976
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,840
What do you think?

977
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,593
I think the Germans are organized.
Too efficient sometimes.

978
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,596
Do you trust them?

979
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,477
Here...

980
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,569
Sulking?

981
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,946
You don't care about me anymore.

982
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,035
You know I'll never abandon you.

983
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,828
You're my little Nono.

984
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,456
When will Mummy come back?

985
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,127
She's tired
from delivering your brother.

986
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,880
My brother?
What's his name?

987
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,549
He's called...

988
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,925
Julien.

989
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,053
Do you like that name?

990
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:13,305
And you? Do you like it?

991
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:15,891
Where've you been?

992
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:19,019
- Go and play. What's the game?
- The roundup.

993
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,146
I'm sick of always being the Jew.

994
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,815
- You can be the gendarme.
- Come on.

995
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,458
Soup!

996
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,003
The Loiret camps now house
almost all the undesirables.

997
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:49,591
They're teeming with Jews,
who infested France like parasites.

998
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:51,968
Turn that off.

999
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:54,096
It really gets me down.

1000
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,690
There's nothing in the soup.

1001
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:08,068
They won't last long on this.

1002
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:10,570
Did you see the daily bread ration?

1003
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,072
Go and tell the authorities.

1004
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,865
I wrote to the Prefect.

1005
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,118
I've gone on the same rations.

1006
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:18,787
What? Don't go playing the martyr.

1007
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,873
It's the only way
to prove it's insufficient.

1008
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:25,168
You think they don't know
in the Prefect's office?

1009
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,261
I'm not hungry.

1010
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,804
Go on, take it.

1011
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,391
You think we'll be grown-up
one day?

1012
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,892
I don't know.

1013
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,230
They don't just want us dead,

1014
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,149
they want us to suffer first.

1015
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:50,235
Don't do that. It's all there is.

1016
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:53,822
It can't go on like this
for centuries.

1017
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,575
Proletarian revolution.
That's the answer.

1018
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,077
Another bloodbath?

1019
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,666
What the Jews need is a land.

1020
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,835
A country we can call our own.

1021
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,004
Zionist?

1022
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,425
- Communist?
- Trotskyite. Him, not me.

1023
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:15,635
My wife's religious.

1024
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:20,765
I bet they put bromide in it.

1025
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:22,767
What?

1026
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:24,561
So you can't get it up.

1027
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,688
What do they care if I get it up?

1028
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:27,564
Young man!

1029
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,150
To stop us reproducing.

1030
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:43,705
Get up.
Get up, your brat!

1031
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,165
I didn't do anything, sir.

1032
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,333
You just spat.

1033
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:48,960
Not at you. A weevil.

1034
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,838
- He's telling the truth, sergeant.
- Keep out of this!

1035
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:54,591
I didn't do anything, sir, honest.

1036
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,301
Sergeant to you, you runt!

1037
01:15:57,637 --> 01:16:00,347
Don't! He's armed.
Think of your family.

1038
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,351
He's on the next convoy in any case.

1039
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,352
As for you, doc,

1040
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:09,189
stay in the infirmary
or I'll relieve you of your duties.

1041
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,279
Can't you sleep?

1042
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,035
Perhaps your sister was right.

1043
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,372
I should've protected you.

1044
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,332
Don't say that, Dad.

1045
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,054
Dear Sir,

1046
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,224
I received no reply to my letter.

1047
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,686
In it, I described
the sanitary situation here.

1048
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,440
The detainees live in conditions
of malnutrition and neglect

1049
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,400
unworthy of our institutions.

1050
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,320
I invite you
to come and see for yourself.

1051
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:42,991
After 3 weeks on the detainees' diet,
I've lost over 14 pounds.

1052
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,702
Nearly all the children are ill.

1053
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,454
Come to our aid.

1054
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,332
These civilians
are guilty of no crime.

1055
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,585
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

1056
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:55,837
No, come in.

1057
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,512
You still hope to get a reply?

1058
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,475
I'll go there if I have to.

1059
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,854
You can't keep starving yourself.

1060
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:14,606
We need you here.

1061
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,610
It's the only way I've found.

1062
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:23,365
If you're sick, who'll care for them?
And the next ones?

1063
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,159
They won't stop now.
There'll be more roundups,

1064
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,911
more detainees.

1065
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,330
I'm relying on you
for when I'm gone.

1066
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,350
Tell the Prefect Miss Monod's here.
He knows why.

1067
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,643
I told you, it's impossible.

1068
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:54,229
Sir!

1069
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,902
I wrote and you never replied.

1070
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,365
Do you believe me now?

1071
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:08,743
Can you reach it?

1072
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,453
Almost.

1073
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:14,457
Got it.

1074
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,835
How are my mother and Renée?

1075
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,754
- Fine. You want me to fetch them?
- No, no time.

1076
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,090
Tell them I'm in Limoges with Dad.

1077
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:25,301
Louise and little Léon
are in hiding, too. Don't worry.

1078
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:26,970
Thanks.

1079
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,808
Give my mother and Renée my love.

1080
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,393
- Okay.
- See you.

1081
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:37,439
How was she?

1082
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,316
Fine. She was all pink
and everything.

1083
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,901
She sends her love.

1084
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,371
Toffees from Brittany!

1085
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:57,333
Do you want one?

1086
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:00,086
No, thanks, we're fine.

1087
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:04,549
Here...

1088
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,927
You too.

1089
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,402
Can I have another one?

1090
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,073
Wonderful!

1091
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,827
- Can we eat it?
- Of course!

1092
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,457
Darling, do you want
a bit of your godfather to eat?

1093
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,086
At last, I can feast on mein Führer.

1094
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:51,804
Who's coming for a swim?

1095
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,695
I just spoke to Berlin.

1096
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,908
The French want to deport
the children with their parents.

1097
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,368
Why's that a problem?

1098
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,370
It's impossible.

1099
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:18,373
We're behind schedule
on crematoria 2 and 3.

1100
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,875
We can't keep up.

1101
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,336
Find an excuse for the French.

1102
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,547
Tell them whatever you want.

1103
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,508
There aren't sufficient trains.

1104
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,431
The Germans can't deport
the children before mid-August.

1105
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:37,308
That's very regrettable.

1106
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:40,353
How can we overcome this setback?

1107
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:44,399
I say they're sponge cakes.

1108
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,903
No, they're biscuits.

1109
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,073
They're rich tea biscuits.

1110
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,285
I heard there's a factory that way.

1111
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,957
When I grow up,
I'll work in that factory.

1112
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,293
Cut it out, lads, they're waffles.

1113
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:05,169
Children! Come here!

1114
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,213
We have sponge cakes!

1115
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,428
Hurry!

1116
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,931
Take it easy, eat them slowly.

1117
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,975
Come on...

1118
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:30,486
Everyone will get one.

1119
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,701
Take it easy and enjoy them.

1120
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,036
There's one each.

1121
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,787
Imperceptibly

1122
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,291
You took over my life

1123
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:30,254
Imperceptibly

1124
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,300
You won over my heart

1125
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:38,680
First, you were like a friend

1126
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:41,766
Then a sister

1127
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:47,772
We made witty jokes

1128
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,192
About happiness

1129
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,990
What do we do, sir?
Switch off the radio?

1130
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,702
No, leave it.

1131
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,538
I like this song.

1132
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,875
Everybody up! You're leaving!

1133
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,003
Come on, wake up!

1134
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,755
Everybody up!

1135
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,340
Quickly!

1136
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,009
Everybody up!

1137
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,304
We're leaving?

1138
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,891
The boy has to go with his mother.

1139
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,768
That's an order.

1140
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,479
Everybody in the yard in 15 minutes!

1141
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:38,633
Is it true they take medallions
in the search barracks?

1142
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:42,637
Mine isn't even made of gold.

1143
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,597
We'll have to tell them.

1144
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:46,933
You'll tell them, won't you?

1145
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,268
I'll tell them.

1146
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,896
You're not coming with us?

1147
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:52,980
Not just yet.

1148
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,358
I have too many sick children here.

1149
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:58,152
Afterwards,
you'll come and live with us.

1150
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,322
At Pitchipoi.
I heard that's where we're going.

1151
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:04,867
Of course I'll come.

1152
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,166
Just a second.

1153
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:15,545
Well?

1154
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,881
It's not appendicitis,
it's a minor hernia.

1155
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,926
He'll be fit to travel?

1156
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:24,428
Yes.

1157
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,222
Go and get ready.

1158
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,483
David...

1159
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,443
I've been thinking.

1160
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,487
I could ask to be replaced...

1161
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,615
I could go with the convoy.

1162
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:48,286
Only Jews are sent East.
They'll never accept.

1163
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:50,454
Listen.

1164
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,999
You've come as far as you can.

1165
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,126
It's time to say goodbye.

1166
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,594
I should have helped you escape.

1167
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,679
And let the children travel alone?

1168
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,890
I'd never have agreed.

1169
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:15,938
I'll send news when I can.

1170
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,044
Not your wedding ring!

1171
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,049
If they want it,
they can come and get it here.

1172
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,550
In the shit.

1173
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:24,006
You think I'm stupid?

1174
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,681
Thought you could trick me?

1175
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:33,391
Bitch!

1176
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:42,942
Is that what you thought?

1177
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,904
You dirty Yid!

1178
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:58,958
Get rid of it.

1179
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,008
Next!

1180
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,637
Right, state your full name.

1181
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:15,057
Put all you have on the table.
Jewels, cash, deeds...

1182
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,559
And no cheating.

1183
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,020
You saw what happens to cheats.

1184
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:24,984
Come on!

1185
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:28,571
- We haven't got all day!
- What are you doing?

1186
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,531
You're mad!

1187
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,035
- Lie on the table.
- Your head at this end.

1188
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:37,079
Is that everything?

1189
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:38,706
Go on.

1190
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,836
Next!

1191
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:33,969
I don't understand.
Why are the men over there?

1192
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,471
I don't know either.

1193
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:01,831
We're ready.

1194
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:11,006
Due to a lack of rolling stock,

1195
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:15,553
your younger children
won't be leaving today.

1196
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:21,183
- You can't separate them.
- You have no right!

1197
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:52,882
Keep them in check.

1198
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:55,134
Stand back!

1199
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,777
Back to the barracks!

1200
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:06,789
Don't shoot!

1201
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:13,671
Go back to the barracks.

1202
01:33:14,381 --> 01:33:16,632
I wanted to catch the train!

1203
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,605
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.

1204
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,816
The lunatics'll see their kids soon.

1205
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:38,445
You're the lunatics! You can't leave
children without their mothers.

1206
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:39,530
Shut up!

1207
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:40,572
Sergeant!

1208
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,242
Let me do my job.

1209
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,411
That is your job!

1210
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,579
Escort Miss Monod back.

1211
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,833
Don't separate them!

1212
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,043
Let me go!

1213
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,182
Take your belongings
and leave quietly.

1214
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,708
You will never succeed.
You'll never destroy us.

1215
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,171
Back in line!

1216
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,217
Out of the way! Move!

1217
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:31,225
Attention!

1218
01:35:33,186 --> 01:35:35,020
One step back!

1219
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:37,731
About turn!

1220
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:43,070
Quick march!

1221
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:56,708
Pick up your stuff!

1222
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,427
Forward march!

1223
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:40,419
You have to live, Jo.

1224
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:43,088
Don't stay here. Find a way out.

1225
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:44,214
Promise me!

1226
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:13,262
I'm getting out.

1227
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,640
- Come with me.
- What about your parents?

1228
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:20,060
I've given up hope.

1229
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:23,063
I can't leave without him.

1230
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,731
We'll take turns to carry him.

1231
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,441
I can't, I have a hernia.

1232
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,946
That's okay. Bring it with you.

1233
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,615
Stop, it hurts when I laugh.

1234
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:37,578
A hernia's a kind of tear
in your stomach muscles.

1235
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:40,163
I couldn't even lift him.

1236
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:42,666
You go ahead.
I'll see you after the war.

1237
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:45,586
No way.
I won't leave you and Nono here.

1238
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:50,215
- We'll wait till you're cured.
- Don't be stupid.

1239
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:54,219
They said we leave in 10 days.
I'll never be better in time.

1240
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,514
It's your only chance. Take it.

1241
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:18,744
- Go and hide it.
- Where?

1242
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,663
In one of your shoes.

1243
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:27,127
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1244
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,008
You have a raging fever.

1245
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,594
You should go and see someone.

1246
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:37,554
Who? The doctor?

1247
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,975
The one in Beaune.
We don't want you catching typhoid.

1248
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:46,396
Okay?

1249
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:48,982
Do you know the bath song?

1250
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:51,985
The bath song?

1251
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:55,405
No, I don't. How does it go?

1252
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:58,241
By the clear fountain

1253
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,203
As I was walking by

1254
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:04,665
The water looked so lovely

1255
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:07,542
That I stopped to dive in

1256
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:14,383
I've loved you so long
I'll never forget you

1257
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,176
Bath's over.

1258
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,055
Go and get dressed.

1259
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:27,688
Go ahead, children.

1260
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:32,526
Most of them
have forgotten their surnames.

1261
01:40:32,694 --> 01:40:35,070
How will they ever find
their parents?

1262
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:38,407
- You've no idea where they are.
- Poland.

1263
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:39,950
Don't worry.

1264
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:44,204
Why haven't we heard from them?
It's been 5 days now.

1265
01:40:44,414 --> 01:40:45,997
The journey takes 3 days.

1266
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:49,000
I doubt they have telephones there.

1267
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,670
No news for their children here.

1268
01:40:51,838 --> 01:40:53,505
Doesn't that seem strange?

1269
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,551
Come on.

1270
01:40:58,386 --> 01:40:59,803
Time for your bath.

1271
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,312
When you were asked
to take in Jews,

1272
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:13,608
you did,
but in a trickle.

1273
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:16,903
A thousand here, a thousand there.

1274
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:22,409
Always the same with the Americans.
Arbiters of the free world!

1275
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:27,372
What's so strange about the Germans
taking Israelite manpower?

1276
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:29,875
Especially with the Russian front.

1277
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:31,710
But morally...

1278
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:34,379
It's disease prevention, not morals.

1279
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,801
We put an end to damaging
Gaullist and communist propaganda.

1280
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:44,181
What damage can some women,
old folks and children cause?

1281
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,475
And the invalids? The disabled?

1282
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:49,895
Why this sudden urge
to take on more mouths to feed?

1283
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:51,521
It's absurd. Unless...

1284
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:56,443
- Unless what?
- It's racial purification.

1285
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:59,571
And France
is an accomplice to the crime.

1286
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:10,665
Joseph Kogan?

1287
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,250
Weismann?

1288
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:23,178
Watch out!

1289
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:29,100
All clear.

1290
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:36,733
What did I tell you?

1291
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:42,864
Come on!

1292
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:57,796
Let's go!

1293
01:43:02,468 --> 01:43:04,386
- What are you doing?
- We're hungry.

1294
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,848
- Stop it!
- It's not an excuse!

1295
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:11,434
Tastes like shit, this soup!

1296
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:13,603
Corporal! Quickly!

1297
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:16,982
What's going on?

1298
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:18,358
Come back here!

1299
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:38,461
I'll go first.

1300
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:50,307
You okay?

1301
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:35,560
The problem
of the Israelite children is settled.

1302
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:39,064
For humanitarian reasons,
I asked for families to be reunited

1303
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,565
within two weeks.

1304
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,911
- Are you cold?
- No.

1305
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,955
Are you scared then?

1306
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:56,373
Yeah, I am.

1307
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,876
It's not the dead
you need to watch out for.

1308
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:00,919
It's the living.

1309
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:03,046
Goodnight.

1310
01:45:08,427 --> 01:45:09,552
Miss!

1311
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:11,388
Get up!

1312
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:14,015
Get the children ready,
they're leaving.

1313
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:15,308
What?

1314
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:17,686
We're going to see Mummy!

1315
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:28,989
Get dressed!

1316
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:30,115
Don't forget them!

1317
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:31,366
Get up, kids!

1318
01:45:34,036 --> 01:45:35,537
We're going to see Mummy!

1319
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,914
Hold on, Nono, let's get our stuff.

1320
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,168
Not him, he's very ill.
Put him down immediately.

1321
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,883
- Put him back in his bed!
- They all have to go.

1322
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,554
They have fever.

1323
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,389
All the children must leave.

1324
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,474
I have my orders.

1325
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:57,392
Help me.

1326
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,144
You can't even stand up.

1327
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,334
Flowers for your Mummy?

1328
01:47:04,502 --> 01:47:07,837
They'll wilt in the train.
Pick others when you arrive.

1329
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:27,232
- Who are you?
- The doctor from Beaune.

1330
01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:34,948
- I have to go.
- No, wait!

1331
01:47:36,033 --> 01:47:38,201
You're running a raging fever.

1332
01:47:48,129 --> 01:47:50,421
Where's Annette gone?

1333
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:53,925
I don't know.
But at least we're together.

1334
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:09,649
The children!
They can't travel alone!

1335
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:12,694
You clearly don't understand.

1336
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:14,737
You can't do anything.

1337
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:16,489
You don't understand. Let go!

1338
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:18,741
Please, don't scream.

1339
01:48:20,286 --> 01:48:21,953
I must tell you something.

1340
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:23,496
Let me go.

1341
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:26,124
There's nothing you can do for them.

1342
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,625
It's too late.

1343
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:30,044
What?

1344
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:32,463
- They're going to die.
- What are you saying?

1345
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,799
They'll be murdered.
On arrival, probably.

1346
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,509
Gassed. All of them.

1347
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,138
You're mad.

1348
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:41,723
Listen!

1349
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:43,850
I'm with De Gaulle.

1350
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:46,644
There's no Jewish territory
out East.

1351
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:50,023
There are camps.
Extermination camps. You see?

1352
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:51,357
Gas chambers.

1353
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:55,528
Some Polish partisans escaped.
That's how we found out.

1354
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,114
Most of the parents
are already dead.

1355
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,658
They don't keep children alive.

1356
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,542
It can't be true.

1357
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,378
The BBC announced it
a few days ago.

1358
01:49:12,963 --> 01:49:15,006
The Allies wouldn't allow it.

1359
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:22,222
The camps aren't a "priority".

1360
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:24,682
First, they want to stop the war.

1361
01:49:25,643 --> 01:49:30,104
Maybe later, when we're organized,
we can sabotage the convoys.

1362
01:49:33,192 --> 01:49:34,651
I don't believe it.

1363
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,019
- Your full name?
- Bauer Abel.

1364
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,148
- Your full name?
- Salomon Thurman.

1365
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:18,027
- Your full name?
- Ylan Kotosh.

1366
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:20,989
Full name?

1367
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,991
Simon Zygler

1368
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:24,909
and Noé Zygler.

1369
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:27,996
Your full name?

1370
01:50:28,747 --> 01:50:29,831
Bernstein, Suzanne.

1371
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,041
Full name?

1372
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:33,418
Gilberte.

1373
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:35,086
Gilberte what?

1374
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,799
What's your Daddy called?

1375
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,217
Daddy.

1376
01:50:41,677 --> 01:50:42,427
Label!

1377
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:30,850
Let me out!

1378
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:33,186
Stop, Nono!

1379
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,147
I want Annette!

1380
01:51:36,357 --> 01:51:39,150
- Let me out!
- Stop it! Let go!

1381
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:42,153
- I want to get out!
- Calm down now!

1382
01:52:55,561 --> 01:52:56,978
What are you doing?

1383
01:52:57,855 --> 01:52:59,730
Someone'll see you!

1384
01:53:33,098 --> 01:53:35,391
PARIS, JUNE 1945

1385
01:53:37,394 --> 01:53:39,353
Go inside and get some rest.

1386
01:55:11,196 --> 01:55:12,488
She's my wife!

1387
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:18,995
Someone to see you.

1388
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:46,480
Have you found your parents?

1389
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:51,861
No. Nor my sisters.

1390
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,660
I have a hundred kids upstairs,

1391
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:02,288
but you know...

1392
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:06,042
no child from the Velodrome
who took that train

1393
01:56:06,877 --> 01:56:07,960
ever came back.

1394
01:56:16,345 --> 01:56:18,429
Have you found anyone?

1395
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:20,890
No.

1396
01:56:22,267 --> 01:56:23,392
Yes, I have.

1397
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,644
You!

1398
01:56:28,815 --> 01:56:31,025
I met some good people.
From the North.

1399
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,152
They want to adopt me.

1400
01:56:34,655 --> 01:56:35,988
That's good.

1401
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:41,243
I'll be going.

1402
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:44,372
I left my name at the desk.

1403
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:46,457
Will you write to me?

1404
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:50,336
Write to me here.

1405
01:56:50,796 --> 01:56:52,546
I'll be here a while.

1406
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,843
Go on...

1407
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:08,771
Gisèle!

1408
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,068
You're alive!

1409
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,333
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

1410
01:58:21,762 --> 01:58:23,220
You know him?

1411
01:58:23,388 --> 01:58:26,182
We found him
near our local station.

1412
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:30,019
He must have been pushed
onto the tracks. That's all we know.

1413
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,854
He's not very talkative.

1414
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:34,064
So you know his name?

1415
01:58:37,694 --> 01:58:39,278
Yes, I know him.

1416
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:56,689
Out of 13,000 deportees,
only 25 survived.

1417
01:59:56,857 --> 02:00:00,860
None of the 4051 children
put on the train ever came back.

1418
02:00:02,571 --> 02:00:05,114
Vichy and the Germans
aimed to round up 24000 people.

1419
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:07,157
But on the morning of the round-up,

1420
02:00:07,325 --> 02:00:09,952
brave Parisians helped hide 10,000
Jewish men, women and children.
