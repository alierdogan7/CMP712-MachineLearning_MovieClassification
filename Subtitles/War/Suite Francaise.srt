2
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,905
(Lucile) 'It began with a storm in June.

3
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,825
'In the days before,
German bombs had fallen

4
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,953
'on the outskirts of Paris
for the first time.

5
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,625
'Terrified people were fleeing the city
any way they could.

6
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,088
'But deep in the countryside
the war still felt far away

7
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,715
'and I remained preoccupied

8
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,677
'with the one I was already fighting
much closer to home.'

9
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,388
Are you not dressed yet?

10
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,641
We'll be late.

11
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,353
Do you really think
we should go out today?

12
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,188
Why ever not?

13
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,250
(Church bells chime)

14
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,086
'My mother-in-law,
Madame Angellier,

15
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,547
'refused to accept
the prospect of defeat,

16
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:57,385
'even as the first refugees from Paris
started to arrive.

17
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,685
'Three years before I'd married
her precious son at my father's insistence

18
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,645
'and moved to Bussy.

19
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:14,735
'With Gaston away fighting, she felt
I should learn how to run his properties.

20
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,363
'So every month we visited our tenants,

21
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,741
'on a Sunday because Madame knew
the farmers would be home.'

22
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:25,204
(Madame Angellier) Don't make any noise.
That way you see how they really live.

23
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,498
'She liked to catch them out.

24
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,836
'I hated every minute of it.'

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,517
Have you heard anything
from your son?

26
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,730
No, not for over a week.
And you?

27
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,107
No, nothing from either of our boys.

28
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,361
- People say Paris is going to fall.
- People say a lot of things.

29
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,948
(Madame Angellier) Lucile?

30
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,201
Madame, it's...

31
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,120
It's a big farm.

32
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,332
And it's been difficult
without my brothers.

33
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,959
We'll put what they owe us
down to next month.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,586
If I make any exceptions,

35
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,464
then Gaston wouldn't have
a home of his own to return to,

36
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,217
and then what would
he have been fighting for?

37
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,764
Come along, Lucile.

38
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,223
Good morning.

39
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,186
They don't want to pay the rent
but they don't think twice

40
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,813
about buying silk stockings
for that daughter of theirs.

41
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,649
Did you see?

42
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,069
I know it seems harsh,
but if you show them any weakness,

43
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,612
they'll bleed you dry.

44
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,199
When Gaston comes home,
he'll see he has a wife

45
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,159
who knows what it is
to be a land...

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,828
Stop! Stop the car!

47
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,668
(Horn blaring)

48
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,923
- We should turn back.
- No.

49
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,217
(Horn blaring)

50
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,221
We've got potatoes to buy
and four more rents to collect.

51
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,974
Madman.

52
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,983
The sack looks heavy.

53
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,110
He can manage.

54
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,155
- How much do we owe you?
- Four francs.

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,534
(Grunts)

56
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,123
Thank you.

57
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,544
There are more cars on the road,
from Paris.

58
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,463
My father always said,

59
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,841
"If you want to see what people
are truly made of, you start a war."

60
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,300
(Honks horn)

61
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,277
(Madame Angellier) Oh, what is this?

62
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,571

(Indistinct dialogue)

65
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,686
Go and see how long it goes on for.

66
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,190
(Man) Keep up.

67
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,735
Keep up.

68
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,822
Excuse me, Madame.

69
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,908
I wouldn't ask for me,
but my wife's very tired.

70
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,453
We've walked all the way from Paris.
Could she rest in your car?

71
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,914
Yes. Yes, yes, of course.

72
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,207
Thanks.

73
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,833
(Train approaching)

74
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh, Lord.

75

(Fighter planes approaching)

76
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,635
- Are those ours?
- Theirs, always theirs.

77
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,599
(Women gasp)

78
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,115
(Man) Get down!

79
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,075

80
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,666

Anna? Anna?

83
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,673
- Thank you.
- Lucile.

84
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,551
We need to get off the road.
Could you take us to the nearest town?

85
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,685
Hey, you!

86
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,938
Get away from my car!

87
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:49,320
(Muffled crying and shouting continues)

88
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,615
Lucile! Get in the car!

89
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,375
When I tell you to do something,
you damn well do it.

90
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,336
(Honks horn)

91
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,509

'So this was war.

93
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,981
'Paris had suddenly descended on Bussy.

94
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,776
(Man) The whole town's been cleaned out.

'Women and children escaping the bombs,
looking for food and shelter.'

'But the enemy had followed them here.'

98

Move, move!

99
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,163
Madame Perrin,
It's Lucile Angellier, Gaston's wife.

100
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,751
Get out of the damn way.
You've got to leave, they're coming.

101
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,295
(Plane hovering)

102
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,129
(French official on radio)

103

'Fear had seized the town.

'Rumours spread that a regiment
was heading to Bussy.

see his things burn

'than in the hands
of one of their soldiers.'

(Bells chime)

109
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,187
Brethren of Bussy,

110
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,815
a great tragedy
has befallen our nation.

111
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,862
Millions have fled their homes,
many thousands have lost their lives,

112
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,949
and the fate of a whole generation
of brave young men

113
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,535
still remains unknown.

114
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,124
Only God knows
what's in store for all of us

115
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,004
and the country
that we can no longer call our own.

116
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,632
- We must hold firm together.
- (Vehicles approaching)

117
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:01,261
We must put aside anything
that will divide us from our neighbour.

118
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:07,267
We must unite into one being,
one family under God.

119
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,021
They're here already.

120
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,607
Let us pray.

121
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,112
- Anna, stand up.
- Our Father who art in heaven,

122
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,446
hallowed be thy name.

123
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,492
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

124
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,870
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

125
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,957
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

126
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,544
Lead us not into temptation
and deliver us from evil.

127
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,504
Amen.

128
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,385
(Indistinct orders in German)

129
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:37,399
Under the authority
and the signature of Maréchal Pétain,

130
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,569
a new constitution
of the French state is signed,

131
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:47,659
guaranteeing the rights of labour,
of family and of the fatherland.

132
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,538
You are defeated
and we are now in charge.

133
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,708
All firearms must be surrendered

134
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,794
to German headquarters
tomorrow morning.

135
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,756
As our Führer writes,

136
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,468
"The sword will become our plough
and from the tears of war..."

137
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,354
- How long will they be here?
- I don't know.

138
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,680
"...the daily bread
of future generations will grow."

139
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,183
But I'm damned
if I'm living by German time.

140
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,770
Those who have been billeted an officer

141
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:19,691
should return home
and prepare for their arrival.

142

(Footsteps approaching)

Madame.

147
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,236
Madame Angellier,
I'm Oberleutnant Bruno von Falk.

148
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,947
You have been told to expect me?

149
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,411
Madame.

150
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,788
I will try not to inconvenience you.

151
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,333
I only require a room
and somewhere to work.

152
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,546
Excuse me.

153
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,841
I hope you don't mind,
but I can't be late.

154
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,311
Er...

155
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,938
They didn't say anything about a dog.

(Announcement in German)

157
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,578
(Madame Angellier) May the Lord bless
these gifts we are about to receive.

158
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,457
May he bless those who are unable
to share his bounty with us.

(Sirens wail)

160
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,546
Guide them from danger,
keep them safe.

161
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,506
- Amen.
- Amen.

(Bruno) Madame.

167
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:41,625
May I kindly request the key
to the piano and the desk?

168
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,756
I give you my word that they will
be treated with the utmost care.

169
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,760
Marthe will give you the key.

170
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,721
Good evening.

171
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,689
He'll be playing "Deutschland Über Alles"
before we know it.

172

(Indistinct dialogue in German)

174
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,779
Did you find somewhere to stay?

175
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,782
Yes, thank you.

176
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,081
(Madeleine) Have you seen this one?

177
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,385
We have to take German money.
We can't go out after nine.

178
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,598
And God help you if you're found
listening to De Gaulle on the radio.

179
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,062
Have you got anyone?

180
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,648
- An officer.
- Oh.

181
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,611
That's the price you pay for having
the best house in the village, I suppose.

182
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
And you?

183
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,074
Hm... nobody.

184
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,369
The only benefit of having the worst.

185
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,423
Why does she look at me like that?

186
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,008
You don't know?

187
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,972
Your mother-in-law moved her
and her parents into a barn.

188
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:06,436
Then she put a refugee from Paris
into their home and doubled the rent.

189
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,030
(Clerk) Nächste.

190
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,494
Name, occupation, address?

191
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,290
Benoit Labarie, farmer,
the Montmort estate.

192
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,797
Nächste.

193
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,511
Name, occupation, address?

194
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,687
- Viscountess.
- Benoit.

195
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,021
- Viscount.
- Excuse me.

196
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,066
Your wife and children were
in church yesterday. Where were you?

197
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,487
Working, not that you'd know
anything about that.

198
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,451
Benoit, please be careful
what you say to them.

199
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:07,664
We've been their tenants for generations.
They never give us anything but grief.

200
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,634
(Speaking German)

201
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,990
Entschuldigung.

202
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,161
- Bitte.
- Danke.

203
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,086
Get inside, girls.

204
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:42,300
We'll have to get used to it, I'm afraid,
along with everything else.

205
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,761
'There had been no men
in our town for so long.

206
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,639
'The mothers of French soldiers
looked on with disgust

207
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,391
'and begged God to curse them.'

208

(Soldier) Can I help you?

209
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,352
'But the young women just looked.'

210
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,229
You are beautiful.
What is your name?

211
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,356
Celine.

212
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,024
C-E-L-I-N-E.

213
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,696
Celine, could I have
a word with you, please?

214
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,782
(Soldiers wolf-whistle)

215
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,118
Can I carry those bags for you?

216
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,287
I'm going that way anyway.

217
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,165
You can say, "No, thank you."

218
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,305
Oh, that's not for in here.

219
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,184
(Marthe) You're not going to like this.

220
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,941
If it makes you feel any better,
everybody who can afford to is doing it.

221
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,074
'My mother-in-law pretended
we were united in war,

222
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,368
'but the well-off continued
to reap their own wheat

223
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,164
'and count their own money

'Others, like Benoit and Madeleine,

'even if they'd had the chance.'

226
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,215
This is for you.

227
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,634
It's just, we have food to spare.

228
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,596
If you know what I mean.

229
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,609
You must miss Gaston,
miss having someone else to talk to.

230
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,985
Mm.

231
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,320
Yes, I do.

232
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,032
Do you write to him?

233
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,493
We don't know where he is.

234
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,914
Well, you should write anyway.
Make you feel better.

235
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,458
Benoit would do anything
to swap places with Gaston,

236
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,044
to have fought like a man.

237
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,420
Really?

238
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,380
Yeah. If you don't believe me,
you can ask him yourself.

239
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,175
- (Baby crying)
- Oh.

240
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:48,968
Ssh...

241
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,017
(Murmuring)

242
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,696
- (Baby cries)
- Ssh... Oh.

243
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,370
- Can we help you?
- Mesdames.

244
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:20,750
There has been a change of plan.
I have been billeted with you.

245
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,545
I apologise for the inconvenience.

246
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,756
But they said that we were too far
from the village to have anyone.

247
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,301
I was surprised myself.
I was staying at the chateau.

248
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,805
- You're an officer?
- A lieutenant.

249
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,599
But this is just a farmhouse.
The rooms won't be good enough.

250
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,644
- We haven't even got any running water.
- Ssh-ssh-ssh.

251
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,771
You needn't worry about me.

252
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,776
This will do nicely.

253
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,285
Here. Ssh...

254
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:07,005
'This young officer relished his power
to disrupt Benoit and Madeleine's lives,

255
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,550
'as if their lives
weren't difficult enough already.

256
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,805
'And what about our soldier?

265
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,615
Sorry to disturb you.

266
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,247
The dog isn't mine.
We found him in an abandoned village.

267
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,584
At least he's a Frenchman.

268
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,300
May I?

269
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,519
Your house is beautiful, Madame.

270
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,399
It isn't mine.
It's my mother-in-law's.

271
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,026
The piano is yours, I imagine.

272
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,863
And what makes you say that?

273
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,325
I don't believe
your mother-in-law is a music lover.

274
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,747
My father gave that piano to me.

275
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,624
Do you play?

276
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,251
I do.

277
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,006
But Madame doesn't want
any music in the house

278
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,550
until my husband's home to hear it.

279
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,059
Do you mind if I sit?

280
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,398
The piece you keep playing...

281
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,570
- I don't recognise it.
- You wouldn't.

282
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,197
- I've studied music, you know.
- Not this.

283
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,160
You wrote it.

284
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,041
I was a composer before the war,
when I first got married.

285
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,627
- You're married?
- I've been married four years.

286
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,589
And a soldier four years.

287
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,218
She must miss you.

288
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:05,266
No, not really, not anymore.

290
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,120
Hello?

291
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,529
(Bubi barking)

292
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,241
Schätzchen, come here.

293
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,721
Bubi, here.

294
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,106
- What are you doing here?
- I thought I'd left something.

295
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,400
So you come in without asking?

296
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,736
I can't hear you.

297
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,323
I'm sorry.

298
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,203
- Did you look at any of these?
- No.

299
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,997
- No?
- No, I promise.

300
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,082
Read one.

301
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,504
Out loud.

What are they?

They are from your neighbours.

312
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,000
They were waiting for us
at the town hall when we arrived.

313
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,794
They're gossip.

314
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,256
Nothing more.
They are just people settling old scores.

315
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:46,469
- Er... they should be burned.
- If I had my way, they would.

It is my job to read them.
You can go.

318
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,750
I don't know
why you ever married him.

319
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,503
Was it the land?

320
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,715
Your father lost all of his
so he sent you looking for someone else's.

321
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,342
No.

322
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,303
My father was dying.

00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,432
He wanted to... find me a... good man.

324
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,226
A rich man.

325
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,229
What have I done?

326
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,609
I see everything
that goes on in this house.

327
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,655
Please, he only asked
to go into the garden.

328
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,532
You should have stood up and left.

329
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,450
Do you expect me
to be confined to my bedroom?

330
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,913
- I expect you to be a faithful wife.
- I am.

331
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,790
Then how can you speak,
how can you even breathe,

332
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,459
when you know that your husband
has been hunted down

333
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,919
by these animals?

334
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,048
When I see them,
I want to rip their eyes out.

335
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,178
What's happened?

336
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,349
We've just heard that...

337
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,770
...Gaston's unit is
in a labour camp in Germany.

338

This German is our enemy.
Do you understand?

00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,701
Yes.

341
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,875
Madame.

342
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,961
I can't talk to you.

343
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,635
I should have believed you.

344
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,763
I think this is why
you came into my room.

345
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,476

the rents today, Lucile.

The Viscount doesn't let the villagers
swim in the lake.

353
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,295
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean...

354
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,089
I meant with your infirmity,
can you...?

355
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,259
What happened?

356
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,097
My horse fell.
My leg was trapped.

357
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,977
Otherwise you would have fought, huh?

358
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,688
Yes, I would.

359
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,485
Nietzsche said
a man is made to be a warrior.

360
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,111
Have you read Nietzsche?

361
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,116
He also said...

362
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,788
...a woman is made
to please the warrior.

363
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:32,338
His leg, did it happen
before or after you were married?

364
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,216
After.

365
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,474
Beautiful scent.

366
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,852
Perhaps I could buy a bouquet
for my bedroom,

367
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,562
cheer it up a little.

368
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,107
Madeleine... we've got
to bring the animals in.

369
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:57,196
Hey, a vase by my bed,
if that's no trouble.

370
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,483
It's all there, Madame Angellier.

371
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,361
You'll get double that next-door now.

372

(♪ "Ode to Joy" being played on a recorder)

373
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,628
(Lucile) I learned that piece
when I was young.

374
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,965
My father taught it to me.

375
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,971
- Anna's father taught her too.
- Oh! Is he...?

376
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,933
He and my other daughter
got separated from us.

377
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,310
But, er...

378
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,062
But they'll be joining us soon, hm?

379
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,650
That's enough practice for today.

380
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,445
Why don't you go outside and play?

381
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,159
Stay close to the house.

382
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,372
- She's lovely.
- Thank you.

386
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,199
Danke schön.

387
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,639
(Lucile) I'm sorry.

388
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,644
It's just hard
with them living so close to us.

389
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,040

00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,707
(Benoit) Fuck you.

393
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,796
Fuck you.

394
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,633
(Bonnet) Was?

395

(Soldier)

396
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,080
Benoit!

397
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,456
Please.

398
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,126
I thought you'd handed in your gun.

399
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,838
I did, the one that was registered.

400
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,634
- (Marthe) People have been killed for less.
- I need it.

401
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,178
Why don't you tell her
why you're here?

402
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,556
The German... in my home,

403
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,767
he's chasing after Madeleine.

404
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,231
The officer that lives here
could put pressure on him.

405
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,775
- I don't speak to him.
- That's not what I've heard.

406
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,657
I'm not here to criticise you.
I just want him moved.

407
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,077
Please.

408
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,295
You have a complaint
about a German soldier?

409
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,465
- I apologise.
- So you'll do something?

410
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:13,053
I have no influence over him.
We are of equal rank.

411
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,680
So it's one rule for us
and another for them?

412
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,807
That's not what I said.

413
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,018
We lost the war. We don't have
to lose our women as well.

414
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:24,815
Then perhaps you should have thought
of protecting them earlier, my friend.

415
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,027
Please.

416
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,283
I will try.

417
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,078
But it might only make it worse.

418
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,747
Tell him to leave her in peace.

419
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,876
I won't ask again.

420
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,728
Our regiment could leave at any time.

421
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:09,484
I couldn't stand to think...
that you hated me.

422
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,112
(Sighs) I don't hate you.

423
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,699
Then invite me for tea.

424
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,538
There's hardly any left.
Your men have taken it all.

425
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,041
Or wine.

426
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,335
I'll talk to Bonnet,

427
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,797
but in return I only ask
that we be decent to one another.

428
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,302
Where's the harm in that?

429
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,680
My mother-in-law
would throw me out.

430
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,474
I've got nowhere else to go.

431
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,603
She has church tonight.
She'll be another half an hour.

432
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,065
Just one drink.

433
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,661
How did you become a soldier?

434
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,540
I'm from a military family.
It was expected of us.

435
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,753
My brothers and I signed up
on the same day.

436
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:13,465
Your brothers, where are they?

437
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,759
One was killed in Poland.

438
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,971
Another one in Normandy.

439
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:23,433
The youngest has just left for Africa.

440
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,561
People shouldn't be sacrificed like this.

441
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,483
- I mean none of us.
- I can't think like that.

442
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,114
Questioning only makes things
more difficult.

443
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,740
Do you believe in the war?

444
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,245
Let's say I believe
in the communal spirit.

445
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,123
None of us like to admit it,

446
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:50,294
but single actions on their own
don't mean anything.

447
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,964
So why is it that whenever I see you
you're always on your own?

448
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,426
When do you see me?

to be the one everyone's afraid of

left on?

457

You were very kind.

458

It's been a long time
since I talked to anyone like this.

459

I thank you.

Well, I suppose
you'll tell everyone now.

They're human, just like us.

468

out of their home. You did that.

Ask your officer. He knows.

473
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,625
Ask him what he's read
in those letters.

living in your house.

00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,309
The only person
I've something in common with...

527
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,147
...is you.

528
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,399
No.

529
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,638

a china dinner service,

530

of purely sentimental value.

from the enemy.

532

'The air was thick with whispers.

00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,364
'Some saw me as a collaborator.

'Others admired my bravery.

535
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,871
'But none knew
what I was really feeling.'

536
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,956
Most of it is here.

537
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,794
I apologise for any damages.

538
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,846
Well done.

539
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,975
At least you've got the nerve
to stand up to these scum.

540
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,061
(Door opening)

541
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,495
Marthe, can you take
these bags upstairs, please?

542
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:04,582
(Whispers) On Thursday
she's going to visit her sister.

543
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,002
- We'd have the house to ourselves.
- All right.

544
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,462
(Door opens)

545
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,243
(Viscountess) Come back here.
Come back here!

546
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,705
Benoit Labarie!

547
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,083
So you're the one
who's been stealing from us.

548
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,376
You thief.

549
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:36,132
What do you expect us to do?
You traitors would see us starve.

550
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,092
How dare you speak to me like that?

551
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,886
I'll speak to you how I like.

552
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,100
I'm not the only one who comes here.

553
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,313
We all do,
and it's only going to get worse.

554
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,441
- Get out of here.
- Chickens.

555
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:00,031
- Give me my fucking chickens!
- Please...

556
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,660
You'd better pray
your German friends stay a long time,

557
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,038
because the day they leave...

558
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,585
I caught him.

559
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,170
It's Labarie.

560
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,798
- I told you to let it lie.
- He still has a gun.

561
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,635
So does half the town,
including myself.

562
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,975
He tried to shoot me with it.

563
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,733
You need to do something.

564
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,824
Offizier Bonnet?

565
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:56,939

we had lived alongside each other.

'Just leave us in peace.'

01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,851
I thought you said you were going
to take the horse in yourself.

570
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,645
What have you done?

571
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,024
Go. I'll distract them.

572
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,738
Boys, quick. Now!

574
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,878
I have a warrant for the arrest
of Benoit Labarie. Where is he?

575
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,173
He's in the field.

576
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,561
I don't know what's wrong
with you farmers.

577
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:20,564
Always stashing your guns
in the same places.

578
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:22,608
Come down.

579
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,902
You won't be
in the labour camp for long.

580
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,280
The Viscount begged for leniency.
It's likely to be a year.

581
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,407
Plenty of time
for me to fuck your wife

582
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,202
while you shovel frozen shit
in Buchenwald.

583
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,641
Get off me!

584
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,314
Fuck you.

(Gunshot)

586
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,277
Stay there. Don't move.

588
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,250

589
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,795
No, no, no!

590
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:33,137
No. Benoit!

591
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:42,688

Madeleine?

596
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,726
Is your mother-in-law at home?

597
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,772
She's away for the night.
What's happened?

598
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,526
How do you know where he is?

599
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,487
There's an old hunting lodge
in the woods.

600
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,281
No one's offered to take him in?

601
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,368
That's why I'm here.

602
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,998
They let me go
but they're watching me.

603
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,293
If they're watching...

604
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,254
...you shouldn't have come here.

605
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:52,007
Look, Benoit's a good man.

606
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,177
No one else is going to help him.

607
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:59,431
He can't move very fast
and they'll hunt him and find him.

608
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,477
And when they do, they'll kill him.
Do you know that?

609
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:07,022
You're the only one
that can help me now. Please.

610
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,111
I...

611
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:23,163
Sorry, I... I don't...

612
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,461
I thought you said Madame was away.

613
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,800
Your officer won't be coming, you know.

614
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,846
I passed him in the square.

615
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:42,224
He's leading the search party
for my husband.

616
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,896
Shame on you!

Yesterday an officer
of the German Wehrmacht

628

was killed by one Benoit Labarie,

629
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,554
a resident on the Montmort estate.

630
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:31,435
Any person guilty of providing him
with shelter, aid or protection

631
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:36,607
or who knows his whereabouts
is required to report this information

632
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:41,153
to German headquarters
within 48 hours of this notice

633
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:47,451
or they will incur immediate execution
by firing squad.

Oh.

638
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,569
How romantic.

639
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,613
I'm going to have to talk
to his commanding officer.

640
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,281
No, you won't.

641
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,825
(Shouting)

642
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,140
- Who knows?
- No one.

643
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,270
- Not even his wife?
- I couldn't risk it.

644
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,775
You should have asked me first.

645

(Shouting and screaming)

646
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:22,499
My grandfather put this here
during the last war.

647
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,295
Get in, quickly.

648
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,382
Don't make a sound.

649
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,004
Why are you doing this?

650
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,926
Seeing him dressed in Gaston's clothes,
it made me think...

651
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,888
...it could be my son.

652
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,057

653
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:22,684

Madame.

Lucile, tell me.
Something's wrong.

665
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:57,445
I made a mistake.

(Gustav) Where's your daughter?

667

- Where's your daughter?
- She's with her father.

668

We'll come back for her.

669
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:23,096
Have your feelings changed?

670
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,016
Yes.

671
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,892
You're lying.

A wake is being held
for Offizier Bonnet,

674

but we don't have enough table linen,
so could we borrow some of yours?

It belonged to my mother.

676

I trust you will return it
in its original state.

677

Of course.

There's still time.

682

Somebody might give him up.

683

- You know, Benoit didn't...
- I know. I know.

684

You did the right thing.

01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,613
You'll never get past the checkpoints.
They're everywhere.

705
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,907
What if I take him?

706
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,118
Lucile, you can't do that.

707
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,411
I'm taking you.

708
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,291
What about the travel pass?

709
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:03,347
I know where you're going,
you fucking German whore.

710
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,234
He's safe.

711
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,843
(German soldiers laughing and chatting)

712
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:45,056
(♪ Rosita Serrano's "Bel Ami" playing)

713
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,016
What are you doing here?

714
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,357
I need a travel pass.

715
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,610
I have to drive to Paris.

716
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:44,824
One of our tenants needs medicine.
His daughter's very ill.

717
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,246
You heard about the Viscount?

718
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,042
Yes.

719
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,169
You must hate me now.

720
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,506
I would if I were you.

721
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:05,761
This tenant...

722
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:10,433
Has he come to the house?

723
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,021
- No.
- That's a shame.

724
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:22,403
My orderly says he could smell
a different man's tobacco.

725
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,199
He thinks you're hiding someone.

726
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,622
And you?

727
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:43,382
If I had even the slightest suspicion,

728
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,427
it would be my duty to act on it.

729
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,974
I know that.

730
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:01,442
I said it was mine,
a gift from my wife.

731
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,039
I'll instruct my orderly
to issue the pass.

732
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,295
Thank you.

733
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:44,026
We will see each other again.

734
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,280
Not as a soldier.

735
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,911
You won't even recognise me.

736
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:12,722
Be careful... with your life.

737
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,525
Is it precious to you?

738
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:27,570
Yes.

739
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,118
It is precious to me.

740
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,361
Jawohl.

741
01:30:58,203 --> 01:30:59,995
(Gasps)

742
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,061
(Madame Angellier) This is everything
you'll need.

743
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:11,025
And, er... Gaston left us this.

744
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,236
Just in case.

745
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,745
(Door opens)

746
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,422
Thank you.

747
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,439
Gaston will come back.

748
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:53,525
I'm sure of it.

749
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,285
Thank you.

750
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,221
Herr Leutnant.

751
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,885
- Guten Tag.
- Hello.

752
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,553
Wohin?

753
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,265
- Where to?
- Paris.

754
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:32,142
Papers.

755
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,598
(Soldier speaks to her in German)

756
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,309
Out.

757
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:17,271
(Cocks gun)

758
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,913
(Continues in German)

759
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,792
Open.

760
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:50,179
Schneller!

761
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:05,611
(Gasps)

762
01:37:07,614 --> 01:37:09,281
Get down!

763
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,160
(Groans)

764
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,288
Benoit.

765
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:21,668
Hold onto me.

766
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:31,113
Help me.

767
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:37,035
(Benoit groans)

768
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,334
Open it.

769
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:04,665
'Hardly a word of our true feelings
had ever been spoken.

770
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:07,459
'Not a single word about love.

771
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:15,175
'After the war
I heard that Bruno had died.

772
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:17,427
'But maybe he just disappeared,

773
01:40:18,137 --> 01:40:19,554
'like me.

774
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:29,439
'I drove Benoit to a farmhouse
and a week later we made it to Paris.

775
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:36,488
'We fought for what we believed in
and four years later France was free.

776

'Over time I tried to forget
