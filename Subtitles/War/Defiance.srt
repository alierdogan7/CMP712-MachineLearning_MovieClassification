- Horodyszcze.

176
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:53,800
We haven't eaten in two days.
My name is Paretz.

177
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,479
This is Jacov.

178
00:21:56,287 --> 00:22:00,803
Two days ago there were 3,000 Jews
in Horodyszcze. And now... there are 50.

179
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,242
Me and him, we hid in a wall.

180
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,842
Do you know a woman... Sonia Bielski?

181
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,755
We knew her.

182
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,479
There was a child.

183
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,165
<i>(retches)</i>

184
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:47,721
<i>(sobs)</i>

185
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:58,920
<i>(yells)</i>

186
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,478
<i>(sobs)</i>

187
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,646
My child...
I should have protected them!

188
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:11,400
- No.
- I... Sonia!

189
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,920
Mama!

190
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:22,841
Papa!

191
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,801
- So many dead!
- I know.

192
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:31,756
Why not us?

193
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,319
I don't know.

194
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,162
Better to be hiding in the woods...

195
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,598
...like rabbits...

196
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,000
...hunted. No.

197
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:55,118
We're looking for partisans.
What is the name of your otriad?

198
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,562
- What is an otriad?
- It's an armed brigade.

199
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,445
We heard the Russians
are beginning to organise.

200
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,405
- Here?
- And also in Lipicanska.

201
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:06,957
Then we are the Bielski Otriad.
You want to join?

202
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:11,044
- The Russians are fighters.
- But you need a gun to join them.

203
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,436
They sabotage railroads
and kill Germans.

204
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:17,076
You want to kill Germans?
Come with me.

205
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,125
Unless you're still afraid
to use that rifle.

206
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,198
Stay there. Stay there!

207
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:27,477
We must get what we need
without killing.

208
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:32,083
- This will not bring your family back.
- Blood for blood.

209
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,567
- You had yours.
- And I can still see their faces.

210
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:40,198
- "Vengeance is mine." Who said that?
- This is God's work you're doing now?

211
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,199
No, only you can do that.
Take a few lives, spare others.

212
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,484
- We must not become like them.
- No, but we can kill like them.

213
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:50,885
Are you coming with us or not?

214
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:24,800
<i>(gunshot)</i>

215
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,681
It's coming! It's coming!

216
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:42,600
<i>(engine roars)</i>

217
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:58,559
<i>(screams)</i>

218
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,485
Truck!

219
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:06,165
Hurry, hurry! Go!

220
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:10,566
Here!

221
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,436
<i>(speaks German)</i>

222
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:50,165
<i>(soldier whistles)</i>

223
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,119
Hey!

224
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,516
<i>(screams)</i>

225
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:12,716
<i>(shouting)</i>

226
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:17,557
<i>(woman shouts in German)</i>

227
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:20,081
<i>- (gunfire)
- (shouting)</i>

228
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,075
<i>(woman) Nein! Nein!</i>

229
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:30,806
<i>- (screams)
- (Jacov) Hey, I got one!</i>

230
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,196
A-ha!

231
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,202
- Vodka!
- Hey, now we are real partisans!

232
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,279
<i>- (cork pops)
- To the Bielski Otriad!</i>

233
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,358
Cigarettes!

234
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,846
<i>(engine roars)</i>

235
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,445
Asael!

236
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:11,356
<i>(screams)</i>

237
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,756
<i>- Asael!
- (barrage of gunfire)</i>

238
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,323
<i>(gunfire continues)</i>

239
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:25,999
Get his rifle!

240
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:40,443
<i>- (soldiers shout)
- (gunfire continues)</i>

241
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,756
Shit! He's going the wrong way!

242
00:28:58,567 --> 00:28:59,716
<i>(screams)</i>

243
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,037
- Come on!
- We can't just leave him!

244
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,005
We have no choice! Go!

245
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,362
- Asael!
- No! No!

246
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,559
<i>(metallic scraping)</i>

247
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:04,565
They thought you were bringing food.
Farmers stop you?

248
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,837
- Hm? They had guns? Dogs?
- No.

249
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:13,357
<i>I don't understand. (coughs)</i>

250
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:17,759
The Talmud says, if you save a life,
you must take responsibility for it.

251
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:20,281
Again, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

252
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:24,440
Oh, yes. I think you do.
And now your little brother is gone.

253
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,525
- How did you get past Lazar?
- Who?

254
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:37,275
Fucking shit...
You worthless piece of shit!

255
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,085
<i>- (screams)
- Enough!</i>

256
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,840
He walked by you!
Someone could have been killed!

257
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,760
I said enough! Get up! Get up!

258
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,919
He should be shot. If we
were real partisans, he'd be shot,

259
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,282
you stupid little piece of!

260
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:53,446
He made a mistake!

261
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:56,446
Mistake?

262
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,040
- We cannot make mistakes, Tuvia.
- Like last night, Zus.

263
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,038
First they will torture Asael...

264
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,199
...and then they will hang him.

265
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,959
You are Tuvia Bielski?

266
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,002
- You know me?
- We heard of you in Vilna.

267
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:19,726
- My sister lives in Vilna!
- My family is there!

268
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,799
- The SD came without warning.
- Oh, God!

269
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:27,005
<i>(sobs) Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

270
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:30,875
- We'll be better off in the ghetto!
- At least here we are safe.

271
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,276
- There, we had had hope.
- Here we have hope!

272
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,846
- Do we?
- We have no food!

273
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,919
- Tomorrow will be another mission.
- Like last time?

274
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,999
- We won't make that mistake again.
- How do you know?

275
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,920
<i>- (all shout)
- We may be here a long time.</i>

276
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,918
- We have to prepare.
- How?

277
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:48,680
Better security,
better at getting food...

278
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,645
We don't have weapons.
People are getting sick.

279
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:55,402
<i>- (all shout)
- (sobs)</i>

280
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:01,395
<i>(all continue to shout)</i>

281
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:05,405
Whatever it takes,
we all have to participate!

282
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,718
<i>- We can't work against each other!
- (all fall silent)</i>

283
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,046
We cannot afford revenge. Not now!

284
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,006
We cannot afford to lose friends
like Jacov and Peretz.

285
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,520
Or Asael.

286
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,478
We cannot lose anyone.

287
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,682
We will map out where we have been...

288
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:15,321
...so as not to visit
the same farms too often,

289
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:18,444
and we will take only from those
who can afford to give,

290
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:21,485
and we will leave those who can't alone.

291
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:24,045
Our revenge...

292
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:27,885
...is to live.
- The poorest farmer has more than us.

293
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:31,437
Quiet. What I am saying is,
we are not thieves or murderers.

294
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:36,957
We may be hunted like animals,
but we will not become animals.

295
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:40,400
We have all chosen this...

296
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,923
...to live here free, like human beings,
for as long as we can.

297
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:49,565
Every day of freedom
is like an act of faith.

298
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:55,043
And if we should die,
trying to live...

299
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,806
...then at least we die
like human beings.

300
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,522
Thank God. Come here! Come here!

301
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,326
Come, Asael!

302
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:36,159
<i>- (laughs)
- Zus... Zus, I can't breathe.</i>

303
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:40,001
I can't breathe.
Look. Look. Look what we found.

304
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,998
Where did you get these?

305
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:43,756
Hello.

306
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,602
- It is alright. Please come.
- Please.

307
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:51,155
<i>- (Asael) It is alright.
- (Zus) Come on.</i>

308
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,475
Give me that.

309
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,726
- Asael, you've been busy!
- Shut up.

310
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,959
Hello. I am Zus.

311
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:04,800
This is Bella and this is Chaya.

312
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,560
- Please, come. You must be hungry.
- Thank you.

313
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,884
And then, we fell into
this horrible bog,

314
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,435
and Chaya saved me. I can't swim at all.

315
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:28,078
- Well, we'll have to teach you.
- We must have got lost a dozen times.

316
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:31,876
I was resigned to die. Tell him, Chaya.
Was it not the absolute worst?

317
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,879
- And that farmer, a Mr er...
- Koscik.

318
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,356
Yes.
He kept making the most vulgar jokes.

319
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:44,560
So you're trying to tell me
that all politics is meaningless?

320
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:47,241
In the West,
the monster with the little moustache.

321
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:50,603
In the East, the monster with
the big moustache. That is politics.

322
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:53,565
Your Messiah will have a moustache,
too, and a full beard.

323
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:56,764
No. The messiahs are all in politics,
and they are killing us.

324
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,726
- No...
- What's killing me is all your talking.

325
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:09,357
<i>(quietly) And Roosevelt?
He has no moustache.</i>

326
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:11,244
We need to know about the villages,

327
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,761
where the Germans are,
who the informers are.

328
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,482
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. Yes.

329
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,325
- What's her name?
- Chaya.

330
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,956
Chaya!

331
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,241
What are you doing?

332
00:37:30,327 --> 00:37:31,965
- Talk to her.
- I hardly know her.

333
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:34,117
You spent three days in a cellar
with her.

334
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,437
Malbin says
the Piznarski granary is full.

335
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:39,405
- But we still need two guns at least.
- Whose turn is it to go?

336
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:42,001
- Zus.
- You go with him.

337
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:43,759
Make sure he understands my orders.

338
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:48,637
Go! Go and talk to her! Go!

339
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,080
Hello. How are you?

340
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,316
- Fine.
- Good.

341
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,078
Ssh...

342
00:38:25,087 --> 00:38:29,524
Leave half. He cannot go to the
Germans empty-handed. Tuvia's orders.

343
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:50,201
Halt! Who goes there?

344
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,597
You know who goes there, Lazar.
We go there.

345
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:57,157
You only say "Who goes there?"
When you don't know who goes there.

346
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,237
Sorry, Zus.

347
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,637
Milk! And eggs! Chaya, our brave men
have brought us a feast.

348
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:06,525
<i>- You can make me blintzes.
- (laughs)</i>

349
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:10,646
Hey... Hey! I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

350
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:12,957
- Hello.
- Arkady Lubczanski.

351
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:14,924
- You are Chaya.
- Yes.

352
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:18,522
You're getting along alright?
Anything you need? An extra blanket?

353
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,121
Er, no, thank you. I am fine.

354
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:26,042
- Oh. Something nice... and soft?
- No, it is alright.

355
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,636
You don't have a husband yet.

356
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,922
- Yet?
- A forest husband.

357
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:36,239
All the other women have chosen
already. They haven't told you?

358
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:39,478
No, they haven't.
Thank you for explaining it.

359
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:42,604
Descartes provided for
the subjective nature of experience.

360
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,884
Yes. You annoy me, therefore I exist.

Ben Zion?

363
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,761
The new ones have just arrived.
They are from Novogrudok.

364
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,720
Your wife...
They say she was killed last week.

365
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,043
I'm sorry.

366
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:16,045
Thank you for telling me.

Can I join you?

369
00:40:58,087 --> 00:40:59,998
Of course.

370
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:14,163
- Oh, I... I never...
- You never what?

Do you get lonely out here?

373
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:33,521
I like the woods.

374
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:37,996
I get a little bit scared sometimes.

375
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:45,685
Tell me something. Why is there a rule
against women having guns?

376
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:49,559
- There aren't enough for the men.
- Women need guns, too.

377
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,795
What for?

378
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,715
For... protection.

379
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,198
Women have men for protection.

380
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:10,238
I want protection.

381
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,365

383
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:03,764

00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,680

- Yes!

385
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,361
Keep them moving! Don't stop!
Keep them moving!

386
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:12,280
Go, go. Move! Come on!
Quickly, quickly!

387
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,595
Zus! No!

388
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,801
Quick, quick.

389
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,480
Come!

392
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,844
Ben Zion, there!

393
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:44,806
Give up Bielski,
and the rest of you can go free!

394
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:48,277
You're from Belorussia! Why do
you work against your own people?

395
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:51,518
For the same reason
you steal from the poor!

396
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,006
To survive!

397
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:58,125
- Shit!
- Next one's to the head!

398
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:03,842
It will be dark soon.
How will you find your way home then?

399
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:25,396
They'll be back.
We will have to build a new camp.

400
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:30,196
- Next time you can draw them a map.
- And what does that mean?

401
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,245
It means we should have killed
the fucking milkman.

402
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:35,921
Your policy of diplomacy is shit.

403
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:40,158
Winter is coming,
and now we have no shelter. Why?

404
00:45:41,127 --> 00:45:44,278
Because you don't have the stomach
to do what must be done.

405
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:52,678
Go! Move.

406
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:55,802
Where is he taking us?
My feet are going to fall off.

407
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,721
I need volunteers for a scouting party.

408

If my friends at the New Socialist Club
could see me now!

416
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,204
I haven't read a book in months.

417
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:16,439
I don't read much.

418
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,517
- You can ask Shimon.
- I did.

419
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:24,365
- Yet you accept me as commander?
- Who else?

00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:38,485
But?

424
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:43,399
- Other things are important, too.
- Such as?

425
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:46,081
Community.

426
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:53,725
You have ideas about, er...
about community?

427
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:56,115
A few.

428
00:51:00,847 --> 00:51:03,042
Oh! More mouths to feed.

429
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:06,244
And more young bodies
to keep us warm.

00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,446
Hello.

434
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,643
None of us knew if you really existed.

435
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:29,995
Excuse me.
My name is Yitzhak Shulman.

436
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,885
- Welcome, Yitzhak.
- I am from Baranowicze.

437
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,316
The ghetto is being liquidated.

438
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,643
The Germans said everyone
will be executed if anyone is missing.

439
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:46,039
So the council stops us
from leaving. But, er...

440
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,524
...every day, more people are killed.

441
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,438
My parents!

442
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,756
- We will do what we can.
- Thank you.

443
00:51:59,847 --> 00:52:00,962
No!

444
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:02,844
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

445
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:10,686
- Please, will you help my parents?
- I, er...

446
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:12,166
I've seen you looking at me.

447
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:14,886
If you were to rescue them,
I will do anything for you.

448
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:17,435
- No!
- Anything. Please!

449
00:52:17,527 --> 00:52:20,678
And what does it mean,
"do what we can"?

450
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:24,123
We will send for everyone
who is left alive.

451
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,722
- And if there are hundreds, Tuvia?
- Then we will provide.

452
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:30,321
And when the Germans
follow these hundreds?

453
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,602
- I won't let that happen.
- You won't?

454
00:52:32,687 --> 00:52:35,485
- No. I will bring them out myself.
- From the ghetto?

455
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:38,240
- Yes!
- So, now you are Moses, huh?

456
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:43,760
- Go back to work. You're wasting time.
- I'm not the one who's wasting time.

457
00:52:43,847 --> 00:52:46,645
I cannot have you questioning me
in front of the others.

458
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:52,205
- We're family. We stick together.
- Why?

459
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:55,962
So we can die alongside
these... malbushim?

460
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,642
- Don't call them that. They're Jews.
- Pretentious Jews.

461
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:01,638
Jews who stuck up their noses at us.

462
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:06,879
Jews who would lock their daughters
away from our dirty hands.

463
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,843
You are nothing to them, Tuvia.

464
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:13,476
They only follow you because they're
too weak to fight for themselves.

465
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:16,601
And what about Bella?

466
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:20,046
She'd be with you
if this wasn't happening?

467
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:24,124
- Don't.
- Is it love, Zus?

468
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:41,715

but all the Jews? It makes no sense.

480
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:49,605
They need us to work in the factories,
in the labour camps.

481
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:51,086
They're death camps.

482
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:56,446
We, too, have heard of such places.

483

with winter coming on?

486
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:15,116
Do you think we haven't all considered
running away?

487
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:18,005
For every one who leaves, they kill 20.

488
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,477
How can I sacrifice thousands
for the sake of a few?

491
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:32,797
We will protect you. We have alliances
with Russian partisans.

492
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:37,358
They're as bad as the Germans!
You're too young to know the pogroms.

493
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:40,996
Our only weapon is time.

494

00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,919
Can you repair guns?

515
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:51,637
- The trigger.
- Maybe.

516
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:56,957
Come forward. Have your things out
and ready. Please...

517
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:02,363
- They were my grandmother's.
- And now they belong to the Otriad.

518
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:05,200
Everyone sacrifices
for the sake of the collective!

519
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,721
We can trade this
for food or weapons. Next!

520
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,286
How about carpenters?

521
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:12,484
- Any bootmakers? Seamstresses?
- I am an accountant.

522
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,166
- Well, that should come in handy!
- Alright!

523
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:24,400
<i>(chuckles) You have a new profession.</i>

524
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,603
<i>- Mazel tov.
- (laughs)</i>

525
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:29,359
- Next!
- I am a shoemaker.

526
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:32,325
- Good. You are welcome.
- Yes, please?

527
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:36,958
- I am a nurse.
- Ah! Good. You are most welcome.

528
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:40,919
Friends!
This is the happiest day of my life,

529
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:44,556
to see you here, safely amongst us.

530
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:48,325
But there are a few things
you must learn about living here.

531
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:55,239
When you are rested and settled,
you will be assigned work duties.

532
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:57,602
Everyone will work.
There are no exceptions.

533
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:01,236
We will help supply
our Russian partisan comrades.

534
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:04,763
We will mend clothes.
We will repair weapons.

535
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:08,681
Women will learn to shoot,
and they will fight alongside men.

536
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:11,924
Pregnancies are forbidden.

537
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:15,044
We cannot accommodate
an infant's needs here.

538
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:25,880
Today... we will start rebuilding
the lives you have all lost.

539
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:35,077
This is the one place in all
of Belorussia where a Jew can be free.

540
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:42,436
We welcome you into our community.

541
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,805
- He is a Jew?
- Yes.

542
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:57,682
Reload!

543
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:01,039
<i>(chatter)</i>

544
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:06,599
This is not a gun!
To you, it is Bar Kochba's spear.

545
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:10,202
It is Samson's jawbone.
It is Ehud's sword.

546
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:14,922
It is the slingshot young David used
to bring down the monster Goliath.

547
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,558
And we will become warriors...

548
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:23,357
...like the Maccabees and the Sicarii,

549
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:27,076
brave men and women
fighting for their freedom.

550
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:29,875
As they were.

551
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:33,601
Fire!

552
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,159
Good.

553
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,726
Boom!

554
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:19,922
<i>(laughs)</i>

555
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:28,762
<i>(whistles casually)</i>

556
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,077
Now, this here... this is a knight.

557
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:39,000
It can move one, two, forward,
and one to the side.

558
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:43,846
Yesterday potato with beets,
today beets with potatoes...

559
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:45,963
Tomorrow, special treat. Potato soup.

560
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:50,086
Stop complaining, you wenches,
and keep mashing.

561
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:53,318
- We love potatoes, don't we, boys?
- Yes, sir!

562
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:55,443
We like latkes, blintzes...

563
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:59,156
Thank you! Sit down.
Put some hairs on your chest.

564
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:02,676
If you want to be a soldier, you drink!

565
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:06,036
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

566
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:08,595
<i>- (coughs)
- He's having a little drink.</i>

567
01:04:09,687 --> 01:04:12,997
So... a little bird told me

568
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:16,602
that a certain someone is waiting
for another certain someone

569
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,882
to ask a certain question.

570
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,917
- Hello, Chaya.
- Hello, Asael.

571
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:34,281
- Let me take it.
- No, no.

572
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:37,200
- Are you sure?
- I am fine. Thank you.

573
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:44,326
May I help you?

574
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:49,525
Chaya, I was wondering if...
maybe...

575
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:51,518
you... I mean,

576
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:54,804
you and I... if... we...

577
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:57,924
- I accept.
- You do?

578
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,802
I do.

579
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:11,797
<i>(Shimon) Blessed art Thou, our God,

who created man in His own image...

581
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:21,595
...and out of Himself fashioned for us
a lasting place.

Oh, gladden these loving mates

585
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:36,964

Thy creatures in Eden.

Cover them up.

01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:50,081
Some talk of returning to the ghetto.

603

- Is there any supper?
- Not today.

607
01:09:35,127 --> 01:09:39,245
- Tuvia is sending out more missions.
- You follow Tuvia like an old goat.

608
01:09:39,327 --> 01:09:43,843
I'd rather be a goat than a snake.
Tuvia is doing the best he can.

609
01:09:43,927 --> 01:09:45,565
We should have joined Zus.

Hm!
She's a tasty one, your aristocrat.

633
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:48,556
- What?
- We were told "hands off".

634
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:51,115
"Property of the commander."

635
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:57,359
Tuvia, I'm beginning to see signs
of some new sickness.

636
01:13:57,447 --> 01:13:59,961
Two of the old ones have died this week.

Tuvia!

638
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,039

- What happened?

639

- They are watching the roads.

640

- The Germans are everywhere!
- You go back. You stay alert!

641

She will be alright.

Take your food back now,
and stay on this side of the river.

643
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:25,203
But watch out for patrols.
I'll wait here for the others.

The partisans have ampicillin,

685
01:20:54,367 --> 01:20:57,404
We have covered every stone
and field with ashes.

686
01:20:57,487 --> 01:21:01,366
Sanctify another land.
Choose another people.

01:21:02,847 --> 01:21:05,759
<i>Teach them the deeds
and the prophecies.</i>

689

<i>Grant us but one more blessing.</i>

690
01:21:09,047 --> 01:21:11,561
Take back the gift of our holiness.

691
01:21:13,127 --> 01:21:15,482
<i>- Amen.
- (all) Amen.</i>

Chaya, this amount is shit.
Take your hand and dig it in the pot.

696
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:43,605
- Get off me.
- Give me some of the meat.

697
01:21:43,687 --> 01:21:47,805
Arkady! Get your hands off her!
What do you think you're doing, huh?

698
01:21:49,047 --> 01:21:53,086
- Pisher! Who do you think you are?
- I am in charge. Get back in line.

699
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:56,722
Go away, little man.

700
01:21:56,807 --> 01:22:00,004
<i>- I'll take the skin off your face!

<i>(coughs)</i>

703
01:22:19,287 --> 01:22:21,084
Now what is happening here?

704
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:23,397
Those who risk their lives
to bring back food

705
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:26,206
deserve a larger portion
than those who risk nothing!

706

<i>- (Asael) Everybody gets the same.
- Not when your bitch is serving!</i>

707

- She is my wife!
- Shut up! Everybody gets the same.

708
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:36,961
Anybody caught stealing
will face consequences.

709
01:22:37,047 --> 01:22:40,403
- What consequences?
- Half rations, one week. Both of you!

710
01:22:40,487 --> 01:22:42,955
- What?
- Are you questioning me?

711
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:47,517
This matter is settled.
Now get back in line.

712
01:22:48,767 --> 01:22:49,916
Get back in line!

- I would never...
- I know.

716
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:07,680
Why am I to be punished?

717
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:10,076
On food missions,
they take for themselves

718
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:13,762
and only bring back what's left over.
And they spread rumours

719
01:23:13,847 --> 01:23:16,600
that you are power-hungry and corrupt.

720
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,881
That you take
whatever woman you choose.

721
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:24,324
- That we keep the gold for ourselves.
- And what? What? What else?

722
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,158
That you are no longer fit to lead us.

723
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:33,243
Maybe they're right.

724
01:23:35,087 --> 01:23:37,203
Zus would have punched him
senseless.

725
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:38,436
Yes, I know.

726
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:44,117
- Well, I miss him.
- He made his choice.

Who did this to you?

731
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,118
Gramov.

732
01:24:08,207 --> 01:24:10,118
Two others.

733
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,237
I used the officers' latrine.

734
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:17,676

Hey, Arkady! When will we eat?
Where is our food?

742
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:19,037
Lazar, you will eat with the rest
of the women and the malbushim.

Tuvia?

747
01:26:33,407 --> 01:26:36,683
- You must come.
- I'll be there.

Lazar... I saw him trying to impress
the girls on guard duty,

750
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:48,437
and he slipped over,
landed right in the ditch.

Ah, Chaya. You look lovely today.

753
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:59,405
Thank you. That looks delicious.
And you look delicious.

754
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:03,638
What happened?

755
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:10,436
Arkady?

756
01:27:14,247 --> 01:27:15,680
Arkady!

757
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:36,439
- What is this?
- New policy.

758
01:27:36,527 --> 01:27:38,563
Fighters get better food.

759
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,083
That is against my orders.

760
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:50,319
You are no longer commander.

761
01:28:06,207 --> 01:28:07,799
<i>(screaming)</i>

762
01:28:14,007 --> 01:28:18,956
As long as I am leader of this group,
you will obey my commands.

763
01:28:21,207 --> 01:28:24,199
There will be no complaining,
no sitting,

764
01:28:24,287 --> 01:28:26,278
no doing nothing.

765
01:28:35,247 --> 01:28:38,762
Anyone who wants to leave, leave now!

766
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:51,558
Take his body into the woods.
Leave it for the wolves.

767
01:28:51,647 --> 01:28:53,080
Do it now.

Your fever broke in the night.

The medicine helped.

771
01:29:34,647 --> 01:29:37,400
- How long was I asleep?
- Two days.

772
01:29:38,567 --> 01:29:39,761
You nursed me?

773
01:29:43,047 --> 01:29:45,766
- I should get up.
- No, no, no.

774
01:29:46,727 --> 01:29:48,957
- I...
- It's alright. It's alright.

775
01:29:52,927 --> 01:29:56,636
- Did you study nursing?
- I was at university.

776
01:29:58,967 --> 01:30:02,039
What did you do before the war?

777
01:30:02,127 --> 01:30:05,881
Well, my wife...
Her father, he had a business.

778
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:08,037
I mean, before the Race Laws.

779
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:14,676
- And she has passed?
- Yes.

780
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:17,355
I'm sorry.

781
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:23,802
What did you study at university?

782
01:30:28,767 --> 01:30:31,725
<i>- Music.
- (chuckles)</i>

783
01:30:35,687 --> 01:30:37,564
You should rest.

784
01:30:37,647 --> 01:30:39,205
Come.

785
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:47,599
- Thank you, Lilka.
- My pleasure.

786
01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:46,044
Who's got the soap?
I know there is a little bit left.

787
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:48,800
Use the sand, Chaya.
It's good for your skin.

788
01:31:48,887 --> 01:31:52,562
And look at that skin!
And married already!

01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:57,356
Oh, look at me!
I've turned into a skeleton!

791
01:31:57,447 --> 01:31:59,199
When we get out of this forest,

792
01:31:59,287 --> 01:32:01,881
I'm going to eat only cake
and grow as big as a house.

793
01:32:01,967 --> 01:32:04,845
<i>- (laughter)
- Tamara! Come!</i>

794
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,997
Join us! At least the sun is warm.

795
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:20,126
- I can't, Lilka.
- Why?

796
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:31,287
- I am pregnant.
- I had no idea!

797
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:37,960
I've been hiding it for months,
but, er, it's obvious now.

798
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:42,682
- It could come any day.
- Who is the father?

799
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:54,643
It happened when I...
when I was escaping.

800
01:32:56,527 --> 01:32:57,642
It was a...

801
01:32:58,687 --> 01:33:01,406
...a man with a gun. He stopped me.

802
01:33:08,487 --> 01:33:11,285
What will happen when Tuvia finds out?

803
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:14,518
- He will understand.
- No. You mustn't tell him.

804
01:33:14,607 --> 01:33:17,644
I won't. I won't tell him.

805
01:33:21,367 --> 01:33:23,403
I feel there's new life inside me.

806
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:27,558
It's the only thing keeping me going.

807
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:31,922
And I won't give it up.

808
01:33:32,887 --> 01:33:34,400
No.

809
01:33:45,607 --> 01:33:49,361
Lazar says he spotted another patrol.
They're getting closer.

Here.

813
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:10,044
- She promises not to take extra.
- This is against my orders!

814
01:34:10,127 --> 01:34:12,277
So you're going to shoot her, too?

815
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:16,877
Please, Tuvia.
The baby is all she has to live for.

816
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,835
- I cannot allow it.
- You must let it live.

817
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:23,157
I cannot keep the living alive!

<i>(baby wails)</i>

819
01:34:26,567 --> 01:34:29,957
Tamara and the man who fathered
this child are responsible for it.

01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:34,646
- They must leave.
- She was raped by the Germans.

821
01:34:37,567 --> 01:34:41,116
You tell us to hold on to our humanity,

822
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,721
not to become like animals.

823
01:34:43,807 --> 01:34:48,039
What better way than by bringing a life
into this world of suffering and death?

824
01:34:50,927 --> 01:34:52,246
It is our only hope.

825
01:35:00,927 --> 01:35:02,724
Alright.

01:35:02,807 --> 01:35:04,877
Thank you, Tuvia!

827
01:35:33,367 --> 01:35:37,201
I know what is expected of the women
here, and yet you never touched me.

828
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:40,006
- Lilka...
- I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia.

829
01:35:40,927 --> 01:35:42,645
I'm not even afraid of you.

830
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,440
You call that a move?

831
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:04,839
I call it an inevitable conclusion
based on unimpeachable reasoning.

832
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:08,886
The question, my friend the genius,
is what are you going to do about it?

833
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:10,764
I'm thinking about what I'll do.

834

<i>(laughs) I got him!</i>

835
01:36:13,087 --> 01:36:16,682
Tuvia! We found this one and two
of his friends by the second bridge.

836
01:36:16,767 --> 01:36:19,964
We killed two. Aron was hurt,
but he's a brave little soldier.

837

Look! We are all Jews!

844
01:36:45,007 --> 01:36:47,237

They've assigned a division
to surround the forest.

- Don't they have a war to fight?
- The assault begins in two days.

851

The children of Israel
were afraid to leave Egypt,

"Trust in God.
He will take care of you."

888

And that is why, tomorrow,

we will celebrate the Passover

890
01:41:47,327 --> 01:41:53,163

Moses. The Exodus. He left
before Pharaoh could stop them.

You want to move them all?
The old, the sick?

- We leave now. Spread the word.

Shimon, this is it!
We are going. Children, up!

Tell your parents we are going. Now!

<i>(barrage of machine-gun fire)</i>

1029
01:55:53,767 --> 01:55:55,962
<i>(soldiers shout in German)</i>

1030
01:56:12,367 --> 01:56:13,436
Isaac!

1031
01:56:16,047 --> 01:56:18,561
Ammunition. Ammunition! There.

1032
01:56:25,447 --> 01:56:28,325
<i>(soldiers shout in German)</i>

1033
01:57:24,447 --> 01:57:26,438
No! No!

1034
01:58:44,287 --> 01:58:46,005
<i>(man) Come, come.</i>

1035
01:59:06,727 --> 01:59:10,163
Strip the bodies of weapons
and ammunition only. Take this.

1036
01:59:10,247 --> 01:59:13,125
- Anything else?
- No. Get the injured into the forest.

1037
01:59:13,207 --> 01:59:15,880
- What about the dead?
- We have to keep moving.

1038
01:59:15,967 --> 01:59:20,279
Everybody, gather your belongings!
We must get out of the open!

1039
01:59:23,167 --> 01:59:24,885
- Shulman?
- Yes, Tuvia?

1040
01:59:24,967 --> 01:59:27,037
Everybody. Tell them weapons only.

1041
01:59:27,127 --> 01:59:29,516
- Of course. Weapons only!
- Shulman?

1042
01:59:29,607 --> 01:59:32,644
You've been promoted. Congratulations.

1043
01:59:37,567 --> 01:59:41,116
<i>(Shulman) Weapons only!
Weapons only, everyone! Move.</i>

1044
01:59:41,207 --> 01:59:42,925
Let's move, please.

1045
02:00:10,447 --> 02:00:14,042
<i>- Where is the rest of your unit?
- (snorts) Good question.</i>

1046
02:00:15,927 --> 02:00:17,121
Are you going back?

1047
02:00:19,567 --> 02:00:20,556
No.

1048
02:00:24,447 --> 02:00:26,278
Well, we have a new camp to build.

1049
02:00:36,607 --> 02:00:39,997
Perhaps you... have room for one more.

1050
02:00:50,087 --> 02:00:52,237
Let's go! Come on.

1051
02:01:13,687 --> 02:01:15,996
<i>(chuckles)</i>

1052
02:01:16,087 --> 02:01:18,157
- Do you see that?
- What?

1053
02:01:20,847 --> 02:01:23,919
The forest. Beautiful, isn't it?

1054
02:01:25,327 --> 02:01:27,477
Yes, it is.
