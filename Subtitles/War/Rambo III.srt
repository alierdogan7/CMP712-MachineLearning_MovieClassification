But over
two million civilians--

and their families--

46

hadn't created anything.

was always there.

Where are
the prisoners kept?

369
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,195
Here.

370
00:32:59,262 --> 00:33:03,098
If we get in, is there
another way out?

371
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:06,669

where is all the bad water.

372

I do not think
you go this way.

377
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:22,651
We should go through
the mine fields.

378
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,419
This cannot be done.

379
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:28,657
There are many spetnaz
commandos. We are only this.

380
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:33,462

We lose more if we go there.

383
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,970
I need two men to get
me through the mines

384
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:42,571
and two

385
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:46,242
If this is done, Soviets
will come here like before,

386
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:48,610

we are not ready to help.

398
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:32,021
Most of the Afghan people
are very strong,

399
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:36,525
and we are determined
not to be driven from our land.

400

mines, and poison gas,

401

and the women are raped
and killed.

402
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:48,103
Last year,
in the valley of laghman--

403
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,771
the next valley--

404
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,574
6,ooo Afghans were killed.

405
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:56,578
Pregnant women
were cut with bayonets

406
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:59,648
and their babies
thrown into the fires.

407
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:03,085
This is done
so they will not have to fight

408
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:05,154
the next generation
of Afghans.

409
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:08,723
Yet nobody sees anything
or reads anything in the papers.

410
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:15,331
What you see here
are the mujahedeen soldiers,

411
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:17,632
holy warriors.

412
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,902
To us,
this war is a holy war.

413
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:23,172
And there's no true death
for a mujahedeen

414
00:35:23,473 --> 00:35:26,325
because we have taken
our last rites.

415
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:29,261
We consider ourselves
dead already.

416
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:34,165
To us, death for our land
and God is an honor.

417
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,968
So, my friend,

418
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:39,971
what we must do
is to stop this killing

419
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,608
of our women and children.

420
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:45,577

424
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:54,119
then of course
we will help.

425
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,657
Leave us now

426
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:01,360

among ourselves

427
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:04,095
and find the best way
to free this man.

428
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,969
