00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:30,068
Rome - Season 2 - Episode 06
"Philippi"

2
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:55,734
Where are the grain
provisioning figures?

3
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,500
This can't be right.

4
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,001
I've been talking with the men.

5
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,334
They had no idea
greece was so large.

6
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,901
And they're sick of the endless
marching you put us through.

7
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,801
Were plotting our revenge.

8
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,913
We must find good ground.

9
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:23,833
They're quite an amiable lot,
really, when you get to know them.

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,367
Ravening potbellied whorescum.

11
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,567
Let's hope they fight
as well as eat.

12
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:31,068
If you will bury your nose
in quartermaster's accounts,

13
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,701
You must expect to be gloomy.

14
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:37,300
Look up, Cassius. Look around.

15
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:40,500
Is it not wonderful?

16
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:44,634
I see only 100,000 mouths to feed.

17
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,400
You have no poetry in you, Cassius.

18
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,834
We ride with these men
to save the republic.

19
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,634
Yeah, well, sorry to be prosaic.

20
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:55,200
Before we do any saving of republics,
we have Octavian to defeat.

21
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,834
Indeed.  Ha!

22
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:12,934
if we play this right,

23
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,467
We can take Brutus
and Cassius by surprise.

24
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:23,634
They will be expecting to face
only you and your troops.

25
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:27,034
So when both our armies
arrive in greece

26
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:28,968
They will be trapped.

27
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,934
And there will be no time
for them to flee.

28
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,084
Do you understand what I'm saying,
or shall I speak more slowly?

29
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,667
No, making use of strategic
surprise is obvious.

30
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:49,550
To that end, there is a list
of the most prominent friends

31
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,367
And supporters of Brutus
and Cassius left in Rome.

32
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,801
We should kill them

33
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,434
Before they learn
what we're about.

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,124
You are a ferocious little cunt...

35
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,571
with a pen.

36
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,674
These are among the finest men in Rome,

37
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,277
Some of them my good friends.

38
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,934
Their money will be
useful as well.

39
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:10,500
General Antony, tell them.

40
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:16,534
Cicero is the cleverest
bastard of them all,

41
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,500
And he has the largest network of spies.
He must die first.

42
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,334
There are one or two names
I'd like to add myself.

43
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,400
I shall start back to Rome.

44
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,534
I'll muster my troops and
let it be known I intend

45
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,034
To go east to confront
Brutus and Cassius alone.

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,634
Lepidus, you will remain
behind with a small force.

47
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,001
Keep the peace in Rome
after we've left.

48
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm pledged
to agree with you.

49
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,901
But I must say,
these killings...

50
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:42,934
send the list ahead
to Lucius Vorenus

51
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,034
At the aventine collegium.

52
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,367
Add instructions telling him
to divide the names

53
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,367
Among the gangs.

54
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,400
I have a name while you're at it.

55
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:54,400
Not Servilia.
We cannot kill women.

56
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,334
Not Servilia.

57
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:59,200
- Rufus tranquillus.
- Who?

58
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,934
Isn't he father
to Octavia's frienjocasta?

59
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,320
Why do you
want him dead?

60
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:07,634
I don't like the girl.
She's a bad influence.

61
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:09,801
This is not a game, mother.

62
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,117
Her father is
immensely rich.

63
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,300
True.
Stone quarries.

64
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:23,068
Woe unto
rufus tranquillus then.

65
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,834
Make sure Vorenus knows
that he and titus Pullo

66
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,801
Should deal
with Cicero personally.

67
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:30,634
All right.

68
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:32,601
Tell them

69
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:34,601
To cut off his hands

70
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,901
And nail them
to the Senate door.

71
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:41,634
I told the old fool I'd do it if
he ever crossed me again.

72
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,434
Nobody can possibly say
that I don't keep my word.

73
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:03,567
Goodbye, my love.
I shall miss you.

74
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:06,701
We're forever saying goodbye.
It's becoming tiresome.

75
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,701
One little campaign in Greece

76
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,634
and we shall never be parted again.

77
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,634
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

78
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:18,701
That would make me
very happy.

79
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:22,300
When you return you must bring me
Brutus' head as a wedding present.

80
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,467
Yes, a wedding.

81
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:30,001
Yes, we must think
about that when I return.

82
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:33,667
Now don't keep your
darling boy waiting.

83
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,500
It's a long way back to Rome.

84
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:39,834
And you be careful
with Octavian.

85
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,834
Of course.
I know how to handle him.

86
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,167
That's what
I'm afraid of.

87
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:00,434
There, see?
Brings out your eyes.

88
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:02,701
What are you doing?

89
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:07,734
Wash that off at once.

90
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:09,834
Yes, father.

91
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,334
What's the problem?
A little blush.

92
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:19,867
Paint yourself
as you wish.

93
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,184
You stay away
from my daughter.

94
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,114
Mascius, tell the collegia
captains we meet here today.

95
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,400
Tell them it'll be in their interest
to attend.

96
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:32,001
- Will do.
- Thanks.

97
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,867
Eh?

98
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,968
Standing up for me
like that.

99
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:39,001
Shut up.  He's captain.
She's his daughter.

100
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:42,034
He says don't paint her.
Don't fucking paint her.

101
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,801
Spoken like a true
third man.

102
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:49,467
I like you.

103
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,400
You know I do.

104
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,867
But be careful, slave.

105
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:55,968
I have my limits.

106
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,367
Each of you has been given a list.

107
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:26,133
On it are 10 of
the richest men in Rome.

108
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,534
You've been given
license to kill them

109
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:31,278
And are to take of theirs what
you and your men can carry.

110
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:33,934
Licensed by who, you?

111
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,843
By order
of Octavian Caesar.

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,734
What gives you the right
to decide who gets what?

113
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,601
The list has been equally divided.
Yoall get your fair share.

114
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,634
I've only got two senators.

115
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:51,567
- Try to keep him out of the mud.
- I will, father.

116
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:55,300
- Cotta here's got six.
- Right!

117
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,171
You got more equestrians.
It balances out.

118
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,467
It's the principle!

119
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,934
Lucius, Lucius, stop right now.

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,133
Lucius, get out
of the mud.  Lucius!

121
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:21,267
Lucius, stop right now.
I swear I'll smack you so hard.

122
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:24,500
Lucius, stop! Stop it!

123
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,467
That's the one.

124
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:35,721
Lucius!

125
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,667
Lucius!

126
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,467
Excuse me, lady.
Is this the way to the temple of...

127
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,001
Vai! Vai. You don't talk.

128
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,167
Vai.

129
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,153
There's more than enough
here for everyone-

130
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,867
Close on 80
of the richest,

131
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:19,749
Noblest patricians for you to murder
and then rob.

132
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,767
Which of you has ever seen
so much money for the taking?

133
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:26,601
What shall we do
with all this wealth?

134
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,734
I'm serious. How shall we spend
this blood money?

135
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:34,300
Slaves?
Wine?

136
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,434
Whores for the boys?

137
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,767
We can assume
you have a better idea.

138
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,400
The feast of pomona
is coming soon.

139
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,552
It used to be that each
collegium would distribute

140
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,200
Fish and bread
to the people.

141
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,934
- Why?
- As an offering to pomona

142
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:51,001
And as a gesture
of goodwill to the people.

143
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,934
Yes, but why?

144
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,667
The people eat fish.
Then what?

145
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,834
Then the people will begin
to see the collegia

146
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,834
As more than purveyors
of violence and fear.

147
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,068
But that is what we are.

148
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:08,133
It used to be different.
It used to be

149
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,567
People would come
to the collegia for help,

150
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,767
For justice, for money

151
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,801
For a marriage or a funeral

152
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,754
When they needed it,
extra grain when the dole was short.

153
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,334
What, we're gonna be priests
of ceres now?

154
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:23,567
Thank you for the history lesson,
but that was the old days.

155
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:26,534
Nothing but war
and turmoil since then.

156
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,834
- Things change, brother.
- They do, brother.

157
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,467
They are changing now.

158
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:33,267
Whoever wins
in greece wins Rome.

159
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,290
- Some kind of peace will follow.
- Suppose it does.

160
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:38,467
Peace is no friend to men like us,

161
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,801
Men that thrive on blood
and anarchy.

162
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,534
The collegia must change

163
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,601
Or they'll die.

164
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:49,567
Suppose we don't want
to change.

165
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,567
Suppose we don't want
to waste good money

166
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,701
On fish for beggars.

167
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,701
I cannot force any of you
to be generous.

168
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:59,300
However, the aventine will be honoring
pomona with fish and bread.

169
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,300
You can spend your money
as you wish.

170
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,671
Oh, I see.
I see!

171
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:05,801
Play the big man
and make us look bad.

172
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:07,901
For that, you need
no help from me.

173
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:11,767
Vorenus, you're right.
You're right.

174
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:14,233
It's a splendid idea.

175
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,734
We shall be charitable. We shall be
large. Let us feed the people.

176
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,334
By all means,
goodwill.

177
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,267
So speak, brother.

178
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,133
Why'd you back him?

179
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,367
He's a man of vision, cotta,
a man of vision.

180
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,801
It's our duty
as romans to back him.

181
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:36,068
- And?
- It's done.

182
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:47,534
I don't trust
that Memmio.

183
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:51,233
- Too smooth by half.
- He bears watching.

184
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,267
You'll take care
of Cicero, eh?

185
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,334
He's at his villa
in tusculum.

186
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,334
They want it done quick.

187
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,467
- I'll get my kit and be off then.
- No looting on this one.

188
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:04,367
We'll show some respect.

189
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,233
Right.

190
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,634
Off out are you?

191
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,867
Ooh, sharp.

192
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,667
Don't touch that.

193
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,667
- Where are you going?
- Not your business.

194
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,667
Just trying
to be friendly.

195
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,300
Look, love,
I know your game.

196
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,634
I don't want any part
of it.

197
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:37,701
Too bad.

198
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,119
It's a good game.

199
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:50,667
Go find yourself some
other fool to play with.

200
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,280
If you ever change
your mind...

201
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:01,701
don't flatter yourself.
We're done.

202
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,801
What she want?

203
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:12,563
Huh?
Oh, nothing.

204
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:15,968
- You know her.
- Yes, I know her.

205
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,100
Where are you going?

206
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,200
Bit of work,
only for the day.

207
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,367
Why don't you
come along?

208
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,527
It's lovely country
where I'm going.

209
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,367
Vorenus,
why don't we all go?

210
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,034
Don't go.

211
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:46,068
I'll be back
before you know it.

212
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,934
Save me some
of that chicken, girls,

213
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,367
Or I'm eating Lucius
when I get back.

214
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:58,667
- Good luck.
- Ha, it's my middle name.

215
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,634
Dominus.

216
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,901
Speak, man,
what news?

217
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:36,434
I've just spoken
to someone in Antony's camp.

218
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,567
And?

219
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,934
I think your secrets will be safe
with hector. Out with it.

220
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:24,184
<i>"My dear Brutus, I write
in haste with urgent news.</i>

221
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,267
<i>Octavian and Antony
have reconciled.</i>

222
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:29,167
<i>Their two armies
are united.</i>

223
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,701
<i>They plan to descend on greece
and take you by surprise</i>

224
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,867
<i>With an overwhelming
force."</i>

225
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,167
Dominus, armed men
are at the door!

226
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,534
<i>"You must retreat to asia
before the trap is sprung."</i>

227
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,100
- You must run.
- No.

228
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,167
Too late for that.

229
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:05,667
On your life, you must get
this letter to Brutus. Understand?

230
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:08,634
- On your life.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,001
Master, you must
save yourself.

232
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,001
Show him the back way.

233
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:18,034
Be quick!

234
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,601
So you Cicero then?

235
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,901
What is your name,
young man?

236
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,233
Titus Pullo, sir.

237
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:35,167
Late of the 13th.

238
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,186
Ah, the famous
Titus Pullo.

239
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,500
I am honored.

240
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,701
Likewise, honored.

241
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,701
Talk about famous,
everyone's heard of Cicero.

242
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:49,667
Yes.

243
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,400
I daresay

244
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,634
Your work today will
earn you immortality.

245
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,100
- How's that?
- I will be in all the history books.

246
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,602
My killer's name,
no doubt, will live on also.

247
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,200
Ah, my name.

248
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,233
Thought you meant me.

249
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,767
Good peaches.

250
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:16,133
Yes,
just getting ripe.

251
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,068
There's no way...

252
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,300
I can dissuade you
from your task, I suppose?

253
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,667
I have a great deal
of money.

254
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:29,601
No, sorry.

255
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,256
Normally, I'd be tempted,
but you're far too important.

256
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,030
Imagine the fuss--
I get back and I haven't done my job.

257
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,300
Go away!

258
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,551
- Leave him alone.
- Give over.

259
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,400
- Put your weapon down.
- Never.

260
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:46,267
Don't mess about.
I haven't got all day.

261
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,300
Do as he says, Tyro.

262
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,667
But, Dominus.

263
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,100
Really, old friend,

264
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:55,734
If you could see
how absurd you look,

265
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:58,245
You would not protest.

266
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,133
Do as he says.

267
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:07,113
Thank you.

268
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,901
No, not yet.

269
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,806
Please...

270
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:17,167
give me
a few moments.

271
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,628
Whenever you're ready.

272
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,467
Mind if I pick some peaches?

273
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:37,634
What?

274
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:42,767
Oh, yes,

275
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,701
Take what you want.

276
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:47,334
Thank you.

277
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,701
Nice present
for the wife.

278
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,867
All right.

279
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,267
Now.

280
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,068
Stop this at once!

281
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,801
Resume your hideous
wailing when I'm gone.

282
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:33,734
Everything will
be all right.

283
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:36,934
You've been freed
in my will.

284
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:44,334
Take care of my people.

285
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:47,400
Yes, master.

286
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,467
Goodbye.

287
00:22:05,815 --> 00:22:08,091
Easiest if you kneel.

288
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:30,001
You might not want
to watch this.

289
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,534
- Such a beautiful girl.
- She is.

290
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,934
I mean no disrespect,

291
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,801
But it seems a shame she'll never have
a family of her own.

292
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:58,167
It is.
It is a shame.

293
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,034
But she could marry,

294
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:05,128
If you would let her.

295
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:08,801
I know Niobe
would want it so.

296
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,667
Niobe would only want her
married to a decent man.

297
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:13,467
And no decent
man would have her.

298
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,367
We might try
and find her one.

299
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,434
What kind of man would
marry a prostitute?

300
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:23,261
No man that she deserves.

301
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:27,200
- Lucius, stop!
- If she can't have a good man--

302
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,735
Lucius.

303
00:23:39,774 --> 00:23:42,436
Take better care of your brats, peasant.
I could have killed him!

304
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,333
You stupid bastard,
you were riding too fast.

305
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:47,300
Fuck you and your fucking mongrels.
Get out of my way.

306
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Vorenus, no!

307
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:53,767
The children.

308
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,734
Go.

309
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:02,701
Go, get out of my sight.

310
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:07,634
Get back to your game.

311
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,901
And you, stay out
of this road.

312
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:34,133
Anyone want some peaches?

313
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,934
- Good day, was it?
- Very nice.  Yours?

314
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,534
No problem.

315
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,068
He's not a bad fellow,
that Cicero.

316
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,367
Not stuck up,
like you might think.

317
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:58,601
Give one to your sister.

318
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:32,334
More names
from Mark Antony.

319
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:35,567
- More?
- Antony has many enemies.

320
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,634
It takes time
to remember them all.

321
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,734
Surely we have
killed enough.

322
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:42,689
Close on 1000 men.

323
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:45,506
The troops need paying.
We have to get the money from somewhere.

324
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,607
Agppa has a point.

325
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:49,601
We should proceed
more slowly.

326
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,901
We do not want
to appear butchers.

327
00:25:54,968 --> 00:25:57,667
Certainly not.

328
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,136
Excuse me.

329
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,634
I need some air.

330
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:33,834
- Long day?
- Very long.

331
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:37,667
It's tiring work, I imagine,

332
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:39,667
Killing people,

333
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,968
Even defenseless ones.

334
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,367
Most of them we shall
let escape into exile.

335
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:46,233
They will only lose
money and land.

336
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,968
Just ruined?
That's all right then.

337
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:52,034
It's not pleasant work,
but it's necessary.

338
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,534
For the good
of the republic.

339
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:56,834
Exactly.

340
00:26:56,901 --> 00:27:00,467
- If you'll excuse me.
- No, wait.

341
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:02,312
You've been avoiding me.

342
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:04,567
- I thought it best.
- Why?

343
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:06,934
To avoid
any awkwardness.

344
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:10,267
Awkwardness.

345
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:13,267
I see.
I was right then.

346
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:15,400
How so?

347
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,867
I think if you did actually
love me as you said,

348
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:19,901
You wouldn't mind any
amount of awkwardness.

349
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,040
No no, I'm glad
to know the truth.

350
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:26,100
Please do not toy
with me.

351
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,901
You cannot have mistaken
my sincerity.

352
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:30,740
But to avoid
awkwardness?

353
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:32,167
I have not spoken to you because

354
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,366
I am aware that my feelings
for you are hopeless.

355
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,500
But that's for me
to say, isn't it?

356
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,767
No.
No, it's not.

357
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:44,867
My father was a nobody.
His father was a slave.

358
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:48,167
I have not a drop
of good blood in me.

359
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,167
So you have risen
purely by merit.

360
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:53,434
Surely that is commendable,
in its way.

361
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,200
You are sister
to Gaius Octavian Caesar.

362
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:59,400
You'll not be married
to the commendable son
of a nobody.

363
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:00,801
I'll marry who I like.

364
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,232
No, no you won't.

365
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,300
You'll marry some useful nobleman of
your brother's choosing.

366
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,601
- Octavia--
- Just leave me alone.

367
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,667
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,611
I've been torturing myself
these last months.

369
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:28,734
I cannot--

370
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:32,334
- I cannot bear to--
- Don't.

371
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,731
Oh, hello, Octavia.

372
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:48,034
Maecenas, I came
to see my brother.

373
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm sure he'll be
very happy to see you.

374
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,500
Agrippa, we can't find
the wretched blasted figures

375
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,467
- For the blasted tax projections.
- Uh, yes.

376
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:03,619
Lovely to see you again.

377
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:31,167
It is no small sum

378
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,968
We are asked to give.

379
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,567
What guarantee is
there that our money

380
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,767
Buys the influence
we seek?

381
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:41,734
It is herod's own agent
who makes this request of us.

382
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,934
If our money can ensure

383
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,267
That Rome recognizes him

384
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,267
As king of judea,
herod will be in our debt.

385
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:51,467
He acknowledges this
himself.

386
00:29:51,534 --> 00:29:54,701
But who exactly does
he intend to bribe?

387
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:58,167
Who knows who will
be master of Rome
next month,

388
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,968
Leave alone next year?

389
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,167
We will not disburse
the money

390
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,767
Until the conflict
is settled.

391
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,867
How has it come
to this?

392
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,367
In this holy place

393
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:17,534
You conspire
in bribery

394
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:20,720
So that idolaters can
rule over your own people.

395
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:22,601
Who do you think
you are?

396
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,534
Sit down, Moses.

397
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:28,001
Would you have
the seleucids rule judea?

398
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,500
Or the ptolemys?

399
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,001
Better one we know,
one we can work with.

400
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:35,467
Why let any of them rule?
This is our land.

401
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:38,801
You are traitors
to your own kind.

402
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:41,167
May ha-Shem have mercy
on all of you.

403
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:50,167
Name yourselves.

404
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,467
We are the sons
of arod,

405
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:55,200
From the families
of manasseh.

406
00:30:55,578 --> 00:30:58,667
We are the wrath
of Israel.

407
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,634
Oh, tevye.
What joy it is

408
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:35,667
To have your strength
at my side.

409
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,985
I don't get it. Roughing up the elders,
no problem.

410
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,030
But where's the point
in something like that?

411
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,661
Zion is the point, brother. We're
redeeming the kingdom of zion.

412
00:31:42,662 --> 00:31:45,170
Remember, friends.
Remember who we are.

413
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,500
We are the chosen people.

414
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:50,068
Not slaves, not animals.
The chosen people.

415
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,334
Make way.
Make way there!

416
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,267
Thank you.

417
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:05,434
- Everybody eats today.
- Bless you, Vorenus.

418
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,667
See?  Orderly
as you like.

419
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:13,601
Yes, very nice.

420
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:16,167
- Octavian leaving today?
- Uh-Huh.

421
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,901
Winner takes all,
you reckon?

422
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:19,901
I reckon.

423
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,601
Shame not to be there.

424
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,534
Those days are
behind us, brother.

425
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:29,034
We've other concerns here. There'll be
peace soon, one way or another.

426
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:32,567
A good thing, I suppose.

427
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,734
But?

428
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,734
You know how it goes
with me in peacetime.

429
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:43,467
Violence is
the only trade I know.

430
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:46,400
Peace comes, and the collegia change
as you say they must,

431
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,400
I'll be on my ass again,
won't I?  Jobless,

432
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,001
Telling war stories
to the rest of the drunkards.

433
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:54,434
No, it's different now.

434
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,367
You and me,
we can do big things here.

435
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:02,567
You will.
You'll do big things.

436
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:07,001
It's good to see you so happy
and full of purpose again.

437
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,100
It is.

438
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:12,034
But me,
I don't know.

439
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:17,367
You're second man
in the aventine.

440
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:20,034
Second man.

441
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:22,500
I can see it
on my tombstone now.

442
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,200
"Second man
on the aventine.

443
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,467
He handed out
many fish."

444
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:29,267
Nothing wrong
with handing out fish.

445
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,267
No no no.
Canny business, no doubt.

446
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:33,934
But it's not soldier's
work, is it?

447
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:36,734
I'm a soldier.

448
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,901
Least I used to be.

449
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,934
Second hour.

450
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,167
Second hour.

451
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:35,167
We should go.

452
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:42,434
Third hour.

453
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,267
Gods, that can't
be right.

454
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:47,434
- They're always right.
- Third hour.

455
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,667
Blind bawdy house slaves.

456
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:51,500
Always.

457
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,400
You're familiar with the species,
are you?

458
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,634
I'm an unchaste
and sinful woman.

459
00:34:57,701 --> 00:34:59,467
I thought you
liked that about me.

460
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:03,167
I'm sorry.  I have no right
to be possessive.

461
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,934
No, I like that
about you.

462
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,882
Are you sure
you're all right?

463
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,734
I'll be fine.

464
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,001
Once you're gone,
I'm sure I shall be fine.

465
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,834
I really should go.
I'm very late.

466
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:35,831
Then go.

467
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:38,968
- I don't want to leave you like this.
- Go!

468
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:28,367
Octavian, please, if only for my sake,
be good to Antony.

469
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:30,200
I am pledged to it,
mother.

470
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:33,300
He's an arrogant shit, I know,
but he's a good and honest man.

471
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:35,934
You need him.
You need each other.

472
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:38,334
- I'm aware, mother.
- Listen--

473
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,300
Troops are assembling
on the field of Mars.

474
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,467
- We must be away soon.
- Where is Agrippa?

475
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,534
I don't know. Saying goodbye
to some woman, I expect.

476
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,701
- Oh?
- He attendsto several whores.

477
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:51,534
Or one lover.
I don't know which.

478
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,233
Be a friend to Antony.

479
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,534
Don't be cold and superior.  It will
only provoke him.

480
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,968
It provokes everybody.
We all know how clever you are.

481
00:36:58,034 --> 00:37:01,034
- No one needs reminding.
- Yes, mother.

482
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,500
I'm so sorry.

483
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:14,400
Hot from a brothel bed
on such a day?

484
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,034
Shame on you, Agrippa.

485
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,367
I assure you,
nothing of the sort.

486
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:22,068
I'm teasing you.
It's fine.  We should go.

487
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,500
Goodbye, mother.

488
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:30,400
Juno, bless you.

489
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:33,068
Oh, thank the gods
you haven't gone already.

490
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,701
I'm sorry I'm late.

491
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,001
Women's troubles--
Had to go to the temple.

492
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,200
<i>Place was a madhouse.</i>

493
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:41,267
I'm so glad
I didn't miss you.

494
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:43,801
Give me a kiss, sister.
The men are waiting.

495
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:13,865
Forward!

496
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,367
So now you can tell me
all about Agrippa.

497
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,834
What about him?

498
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,534
How long have you
two been lovers?

499
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:35,467
It's not true.

500
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:38,300
Oh, please. Don't lie to your mother.
You know it's futile.

501
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,701
How did you know?

502
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:48,267
I didn't until now.

503
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:52,434
You mustn't--
You mustn't tell Octavian.

504
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,367
- Please.
- It's harmless enough, I suppose.

505
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,867
Both you and Agrippa have
good reason to be discreet.

506
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:02,133
- You may as well enjoy yourself.
- Thank you.

507
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,300
Just so long as you keep
your wits about you.

508
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,867
Don't be thinking you can
go off and marry him someday

509
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:09,367
- Because it's not
gonna happen.
- I know.

510
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:12,534
But I love him,
mother.

511
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,367
I love him.

512
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:17,068
Soft as cheese.

513
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,167
What am I gonna do
with you?

514
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:21,467
Help me!

515
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:24,707
Gods, help me!

516
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,100
Gods, help me!

517
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:30,334
Please help me!
I beg you to help me.

518
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,434
Jocasta, what's wrong?

519
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,634
What's happened to you?

520
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:37,100
Men came in the night.

521
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,334
All my family are dead.

522
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,500
They killed them
and took me away.

523
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:46,334
- They have dishonored me.
- You're safe now.

524
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,601
Isn't she, mother?
We'll keep her safe.

525
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,467
Of course.
We'll protect you.

526
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:22,001
- Hey.
- Hey.

527
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,867
Whole place stinks
of fish, doesn't it?

528
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:35,567
I don't mind.
Reminds me of home.

529
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:38,133
Oh, right.

530
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,596
Like fish, did they,
your lot?

531
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,834
I didn't know that.

532
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,267
We had a big lake.
Deep.

533
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:51,634
A lot of fish.

534
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,701
What is the helmet for?

535
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,200
Nothing.

536
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,167
Just thinking of old days,
that's all.

537
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,801
Old days.

538
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:03,334
Not today.

539
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,295
- Soldiers leaving.
- You mean me,

540
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:08,968
Leaving with them?
No.

541
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,196
No.

542
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,801
Well, it had crossed
my mind, obviously.

543
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:19,760
I'm in with the chiefs,
aren't I?

544
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,667
If I was to go back
in now,

545
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:25,500
I'd probably be first spear, at least.
Legate even.

546
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:27,734
Think about that:
wife of a legate.

547
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:31,233
Talk about respect
and money.

548
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:33,267
Probably buy a lake.

549
00:41:37,527 --> 00:41:39,444
It'll be
a short campaign.

550
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,767
Everyone says so.

551
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:50,701
Sons of dis,
I was only talking.

552
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:52,968
No call for blubbery.

553
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:00,801
I'm "preglant."

554
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,334
What?

555
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,001
I'm "preglant!"

556
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:08,834
- "Preglant!"
- Pregnant?

557
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:11,167
Whatever you call it.

558
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:27,267
What is that
you've got there?

559
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:29,634
You've been mooning
over it the last hour.

560
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:34,167
This is my father's
signet ring.

561
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:35,968
I received it
from my mother.

562
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:39,133
I remember it on his hand
when I was a boy.

563
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,001
It's a good fit.

564
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:49,434
Sir, word from the scouts.
The enemy is sighted.

565
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,500
- At last.
- It's not just Octavian, sir.

566
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,300
Mark Antony is with him.

567
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:56,567
- That's impossible.
- The heron standard was seen.

568
00:42:56,634 --> 00:42:59,267
- How many legions?
- 19, it seems.

569
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:02,167
To our 14.

570
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,634
The worm turns.

571
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:10,367
- How far away are they?
- A day's march.

572
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:12,534
Muster the men.

573
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:15,500
We must break camp and begin
the retreat immediately.

574
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,267
No, wait.  Stop.

575
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,667
Do nothing.
We will not retreat.

576
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,765
- Old friend, this is--
- No.

577
00:43:36,462 --> 00:43:38,100
No more running.

578
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,534
We will meet them
here tomorrow.

579
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,601
If we win...

580
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,200
all the more glory for us.

581
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:53,233
And if we are to die,

582
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:56,400
This is as good
a place as any.

583
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,901
'Tis in the hands
of the gods now.

584
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:05,467
We have the upper ground.

585
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:08,634
As he says.

586
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:48,667
Heavens,
I entirely forgot.

587
00:44:48,734 --> 00:44:50,834
Today is your birthday,
isn't it?

588
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:53,834
Is it?
I believe you're right.

589
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:00,567
Happy birthday.

590
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:02,034
Sorry there's no cake.

591
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:05,467
Next year, eh? You can bake me
an extra big one.

592
00:45:05,534 --> 00:45:07,400
I shan't forget.

593
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:10,267
No cinnamon--
Makes me sneeze.

594
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:24,200
If you need to urinate,
now would be the time.

595
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:27,001
I'm fine,
thank you.

596
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:28,968
You sure?

597
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:33,434
Let us begin then.

598
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:36,573
Watch closely, boy.

599
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,667
This is how history
is made.

600
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:46,334
Now, let's have
some fun.

601
00:45:49,968 --> 00:45:53,334
Advance!

602
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:09,233
Sorry, rude of me.

603
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:11,300
Would you like the honor?

604
00:46:12,157 --> 00:46:14,567
No no,
you do it by all means.

605
00:46:15,977 --> 00:46:17,867
Thank you.

606
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:22,934
Advance!

607
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:46,767
What is happening?
Do you know?

608
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:49,100
No idea.

609
00:47:54,068 --> 00:47:56,901
On my command,
follow me.

610
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,767
Where are you going?

611
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:03,133
When in doubt...
attack!

612
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:07,300
Standard on Antony!

613
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,001
Go.

614
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:21,901
Thank you.

615
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,834
You two, on me.

616
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,001
Yes, sir.

617
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,267
Sir, Antony's forces
have broken the line.

618
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,434
Our right flank is gone.

619
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,801
- Halt!
- Our right flank is gone.

620
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,001
Send in
the reserve cohort.

621
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:23,434
Testudo!

622
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:40,133
Teombure!

623
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,934
Forward!

624
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,267
Down.

625
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:11,901
Cassius?

626
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,300
Cassius?

627
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:21,367
What happened?

628
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:23,734
Not sure,
to be honest.

629
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,100
Hell of a birthday.

630
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:29,601
Don't despair.
The day's not done yet.

631
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,233
Sir, our center is routed.
We must fall back.

632
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,467
We must fall back
immediately.

633
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:47,934
I see.
All right.

634
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:51,100
Come, old friend,
we have to move.

635
00:50:52,328 --> 00:50:54,500
Sir, we must go.

636
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:56,634
Cassius?

637
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,634
We must go.

638
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,068
Sir.

639
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:41,100
It has been an honor
and a pleasure leading you.

640
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:45,001
I am sorry we could not
do better.

641
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,667
But you must look
to yourselves now.

642
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:49,834
Save your ins.

643
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:51,567
Sir...

644
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:58,534
give my best to my mother.

645
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:01,034
Tell her...

646
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:10,500
tell her
something suitable.

647
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:08,267
Cohort halt!

648
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:01,867
Keep searching.
Throw the dead on the pyre.

649
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:03,968
Breathe deep, boy.

650
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:06,133
The smell of victory.

651
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,801
Smoke, shit
and rotting flesh.

652
00:54:08,867 --> 00:54:11,167
Beautiful,
isn't it?

653
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:12,634
What report, Agrippa?

654
00:54:12,701 --> 00:54:14,601
The body of Cassius
has been found.

655
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:16,667
We're still searching
for Brutus.

656
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:18,901
Excellent.

657
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:21,601
Have the head
packed in salt

658
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:23,567
For transportation
back to Rome.

659
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:26,701
People appreciate

660
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:29,500
the little touches, I find.
