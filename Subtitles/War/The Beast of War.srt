AFGHANISTAN, 1981

3
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,395
THE SECOND YEAR
OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION

4
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,799
Spread out.

5
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,632
Spread out.

6
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,268
Move it.

7
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,394
Get your weapon out, Golikov.

8
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,074
Kaminski.

9
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,277
Move it.

10
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,390
Over here, over here.

11
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,992
Kaminski.

12
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,271
<i>- T5447, what's your status?
- Mopping up, almost done.</i>

13
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,153
<i>All units rejoin the column.</i>

14
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,628
I got them.

15
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,919
Did you get them sheep?
There's only a couple left...

16
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,839
<i>T5447. Roger, six.</i>

17
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,037
- Behind this building over there-
- Got a souvenir!

18
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,078
Give me the flamethrower.

19
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,992
What you got?

20
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,350
- Come to me! Over this way!
- On my way.

21
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,348
Golikov, come on over here.
Bring that cyanide.

22
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,358
Where's the extra satchels?

23
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,113
Molotov!

24
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,949
I'm burning!

25
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,551
- You owe me.
- Bring him.

26
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,991
Come on, get his arm.
Come on, come on!

27
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,269
Move it!

28
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,751
You son of a bitch! You're dead!

29
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,956
Put him under the track.

30
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,553
- Get your feet under there.
- Do you want me to kick him?

31
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,030
You can't kill my friends!

32
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,950
- Mount and crank it up.
- We're gonna squash you like a grape.

33
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,159
Ask him where the other rebels are.

34
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,350
Where are the rebels?

35
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,150
Mujahedeen are all around you!

36
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,393
Ten Russian dogs will die
for every Afghan!

37
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,797
- What did he say?
- He does not know, sir.

38
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,952
Tell them to stop!

39
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,790
No further!

40
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,953
Let him go!

41
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Sherina! I order you away from here!

42
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,749
Bitch!

43
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,599
This commander prefers
bullets to words. Go!

44
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,355
Traitor!

45
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,674
Tell your shit eater of a
commander to let him go!

46
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,200
Sir, these women humbly beg you
for the prisoner, sir.

47
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,351
You tell them to watch
what happens to rebels.

48
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,151
Do it, Koverchenko.

49
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,799
He is to be my husband!

50
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,758
No Russian will escape Afghanistan!

51
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,795
Forward!

52
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,598
Forward!

53
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,833
Allah is the only God...!

54
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,831
<i>- Directions, sir?
- Right fork.</i>

55
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
<i>- What?
- Right fork.</i>

56
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,833
<i>- Sir, you sure?
- I said right fork. Do you copy?</i>

57
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,034
<i>- Yes, sir.
- T5447, do you copy?</i>

58
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,916
<i>- What's your position?
- Why can't they hear us?</i>

59
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,594
<i>T5447, do you copy?</i>

60
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,913
The tank is lost.

61
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,435
No...

62
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,313
We need help.

63
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,030
Taj...

64
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,230
Uncle...

65
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,710
Come on.

66
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,599
Uncle... why?

67
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,948
Retaliation.

68
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,073
Be his mother.

69
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,350
Moustafa!

70
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,112
Salaam, Taj Mohamed.

71
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,359
Cousin, truce.

72
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,869
Greetings, uncle.

73
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,275
I always said, have faith in
Allah and keep a hidden pistol.

74
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,510
Every part of me
screams to see your blood.

75
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,350
Nothing has changed
between us, then.

76
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,550
Taj...

77
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,192
...your father would never
dishonor a truce.

78
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,835
What do you want here?

79
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,069
A tank that killed your people
is lost in the valley of the Jackal.

80
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,390
I know that valley.

81
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,390
It only has one way in and out.

82
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,316
I come to call upon your
honor to avenge Afghanistan.

83
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,917
When Moustafa talks of honor...

84
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,039
...the end of the world is at hand.

85
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,434
Cousin, uncle, we are tired
of this ancient vendetta.

86
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,394
Let us take revenge together...
We divide the booty.

87
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,273
I will not fight with a scavenger...

88
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,911
...who picks gold from the
teeth of dead Russians.

89
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,633
Then run to Pakistan.

90
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,277
I would speak with the Khan.

91
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,710
My father was killed.

92
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,395
My brother Shahzaman is now Khan.

93
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,476
Your brother was martyred
by a Russian tank.

94
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,198
You are now Khan, Taj Mohamed.

95
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,356
My Khan, we would fight with
you to avenge Shahzaman.

96
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,832
With this we can destroy the tank!

97
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,559
I know how to work it!

98
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,793
What do you say, Taj?

99
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,316
Your brother did not go to
Pakistan... He went to Paradise.

100
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,274
Allah...

101
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,988
Give me a man to tear apart.

102
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,115
From this time forth...

103
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,478
I am a stone in your sling!

104
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,833
Revenge!

105
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,876
- I don't see a village.
- I can't raise them.

106
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,756
- Shit!
- Come on!

107
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,836
- Sir?
- Where the hell are we?

108
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,758
I don't know, sir.

109
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,556
- Where's the Kandahar Road?
- "m not sure, sir.

110
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,356
The Molotov took our radio out.
We can receive but not transmit.

111
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,952
Those hills must be here.

112
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,548
- Is Kandahar on the other side?
- "m not sure.

113
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,356
- Base coordinates are 31 degrees-
- You're relieved of your post.

114
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,028
- Give the log to Koverchenko.
- Why?

115
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,993
- Incompetence.
- What's my function?

116
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,397
None. Give yourself
a medal, Koverchenko.

117
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,956
- For what?
- Trying to save those tankers.

118
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,158
- Check this side out.
- To your post!

119
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,512
Just say, "Yes, sir"
and keep out of his way.

120
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,555
- Why'd that rebel laugh at me?
- It wasn't at you, he was happy.

121
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,116
You die in a holy war,
you go to paradise.

122
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,038
You believe that?

123
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,557
After university,
"m not sure what I believe.

124
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,159
I need a woman!

125
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,238
- Maybe you'll find another sheep.
- Maybe.

126
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,956
- Kaminski, turn that music off.
- Golikov put it on, sir.

127
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,353
Shit!

128
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,679
Come here,
I got something to show you.

129
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,519
- Under siege!
- Driver, crank it up!

130
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,358
Gunner!

131
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,754
Troops on the ridge!

132
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,551
Turn power!

133
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,158
- Range?
- Three-zero-zero!

134
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,753
What's wrong?

135
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,837
Get it out of here!

136
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,912
- Ready to roll.
- Rock forward, go. Go!

137
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,913
- Heads up, Samad.
- Traversing!

138
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,149
Up!

139
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,073
- Fire.
- On the way.

140
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,356
Let's go!

141
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,317
You said you could kill
the tank in one shot!

142
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,233
Maybe it is not the will of Allah.

143
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,236
Or maybe you are a bad shot!

144
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,028
I am Khan!

145
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,789
I demand to be the one
to explode the tank!

146
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,716
Give me the RPG!

147
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,870
Your nephew is a hothead, uncle.

148
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,151
We all stay together!

149
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,355
Taj...

150
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,195
Who calls himself Khan is not a Khan.

151
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,035
Patience, Taj.

152
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,719
This is your trial.

153
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,390
Uncle?

154
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,196
It's nothing. A scratch.

155
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,790
Come...

156
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,077
Allah gives us tracks to follow.

157
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,268
Khanzaman! Afzal! Come on!

158
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,828
Only one drank the water, Samad!

159
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,555
I told you to throw
that canister far away.

160
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,270
At my command, gunner. Frag.

161
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,674
Move, move, move. Move it.

162
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,312
- Frag is up.
- Fire.

163
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,953
On the way.

164
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,998
- Misfire.
- Go to manual.

165
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,676
- Misfire.
- Out of the tank!

166
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,188
- What happened?
- Misfire. I know it's gonna blow.

167
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,550
The shell looked okay to me.

168
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,829
Samad, did you touch that shell?

169
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,948
Yes, sir.

170
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,674
I just handed it-
I handed it to Golikov, sir.

171
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,755
Misfires happen, sir.
One in every hundred rounds. Cook-off.

172
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,750
It's the loader's
responsibility to unload.

173
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,154
Golikov.

174
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
I've never handled a cook-off before.

175
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,672
I will do it, sir.

176
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,755
He doesn't know what he's doing, sir.
Let me go.

177
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,588
- All right. Kaminski.
- Sir?

178
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,032
Pinpoint the mujas.
Don't take your eyes off them.

179
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,470
Koverchenko, Golikov.

180
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,758
Sir, maybe I ought to do this.
What if something happens?

181
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,598
Then Kaminski will have
his first command.

182
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,673
Just tell me one thing.

183
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,678
Why do you stick up for the Afghan?

184
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,558
Because he's doing the best he can.

185
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,194
That's what worries me.

186
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,277
You've got what it takes.
"ve seen it.

187
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,994
Just keep your head on straight.

188
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,477
Why don't we just fight?

189
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,196
Because they could put a hole
right through us with that RPG.

190
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,674
What happened?

191
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,668
They're gone.
Samad just saved their lives.

192
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,871
I didn't do anything.

193
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,594
- Booby-trap that round.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,273
Come on, come on.

195
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,269
- Get us out of here.
- Moving tank.

196
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,275
We bleed because we are weak
for Russian junk.

197
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,674
Your mujahed has no chance to live.

198
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,309
Our uncle is wounded too.
Let him stay here with Noor.

199
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,516
My wound will heal
when I see the tank explode.

200
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,755
We leave him food and water.

201
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,710
God is great.

202
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,868
Another grave.

203
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,276
The wind covers the tank tracks...
we want to return to the village.

204
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,552
<i>You have no village - only "Badal"!</i>

205
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,953
A Holy Man.

206
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,830
David! You have come!

207
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,674
Prophet Mohamed bid me build
a fire to light your way.

208
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,471
God willing, with only a stone
you will slay The Beast, David!

209
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,070
What Beast?

210
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,109
Goliath!

211
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,519
Look Taj... tank tracks!

212
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,676
Build a fire, sir?

213
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,357
I'm sure you lost
those muja fucks, sir.

214
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,872
- Tend to the track, Kaminski.
- You got it, sir.

215
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,873
Let me hit that.

216
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,795
<i>It is Pushtunwali.
It's the code of honor.</i>

217
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,829
<i>- Pushtunwali.
- Three obligations.</i>

218
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,191
<i>First, melmastia: hospitality.</i>

219
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,959
<i>Melmastia.</i>

220
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,351
<i>Second, badal: revenge.</i>

221
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,639
<i>- Badal.
- Third, nanawatai:</i>

222
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,556
The obligation to give sanctuary
to all those who ask.

223
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,431
- To all?
- All.

224
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,154
- Even the enemy?
- All.

225
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,876
What if I kill your brother?

226
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,511
<i>And you come for badal, revenge...</i>

227
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,756
<i>...and I ask for nanawatai?</i>

228
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,758
Then "d be obligated
to feed, clothe and protect you.

229
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,076
It's incredibly civilized.

230
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,998
<i>- What is it, nanawatai?
- Nanawatai.</i>

231
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,789
<i>- Nanawatai.
- Bread?</i>

232
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,032
Smells like he's been chewing on
fucking buffalo shit.

233
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,279
Laszlo...

234
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,350
- ... when we get back, transfer out.
- I'll win his respect in time.

235
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,509
When the old man gets on your back,
you can't shake him off.

236
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,669
Dear Konstantin, I regard this abuse
as the price I must pay to learn.

237
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,469
I love Afghanistan, but we are
a flea in the tail of a bear.

238
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,349
We must join the 20th century.

239
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,155
When Afghans accept that,
I will be there...

240
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,113
...knowing technology and Russian.

241
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,754
- So you're a patriot?
- Yes.

242
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,078
So was that rebel. He wanted
to keep things the same.

243
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,479
I wish I believed in
something that much. I envy him.

244
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,628
- Then why did you crush him?
- I had no choice.

245
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,033
- You always have a choice.
- She sent nudes of herself?

246
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,028
- Give it to me.
- She's got that nympho look.

247
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,597
I got the half I want.

248
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,071
- You son of a bitch.
- Get the fuck off me!

249
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,070
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing, sir.

250
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,672
Thanks, Konstantin.

251
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,478
What is this?

252
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,276
- Brake fluid?!
- No wonder they don't work.

253
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,630
Keeps me steady on the gun, sir.
I filter it through bread.

254
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,039
I add raisins and sugar. It ferments
in a few days and gives a good kick.

255
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,077
- Write him up, sir?
- Get over here.

256
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,237
For one mistake?

257
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,069
He's the best gunner in the division.
Omit it.

258
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,272
It's already done, sir. In ink.

259
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,669
You better watch your ass from now on.

260
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,158
Sometimes Afghan snipers
pick off tank drivers.

261
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,273
- Sometimes drivers pick them off first.
- Really?

262
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,678
Grenade!

263
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,915
Get down!

264
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,673
Shit!

265
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,678
Where are they?

266
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,789
Don't blow it up!

267
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,590
Kill the Russians underneath,
not the tank!

268
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,753
Grenade!

269
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,037
- Open the hatch!
- "m getting slaughtered!

270
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,673
Open the hatch!

271
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,877
I'm bleeding! "m bleeding!

272
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,237
- Inside!
- Get inside.

273
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,556
Get in the tank! Hurry up!

274
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,674
Get us the hell out of here!

275
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,635
Hurry up!

276
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,390
We got a fire on top!

277
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,433
- "m dying! "m dying!
- I can't see.

278
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,868
Hard right!

279
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,273
Gunner, traverse right, 180!

280
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,916
- "m dying!
- Extinguisher!

281
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,315
Traversing!

282
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,470
I can't see through the fire!

283
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,599
Gunner, identify! Bead on
the fire of the campsite.

284
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,870
I can't get elevation.

285
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,273
We can detect anything
in a 100-metre radius.

286
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,671
They must have camels
or something to keep up.

287
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,757
They really want this tank.

288
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,474
- They just keep coming.
- Shut up.

289
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,277
How much longer are we gonna stay?

290
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,358
Till we can see where we're going.

291
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,869
- Crack the hatch, sir?
- No.

292
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,795
- Sir, I have to piss.
- Hold it.

293
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,038
- Do you have water?
- All the canteens were left behind.

294
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,471
- All the rations too.
- Great.

295
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,912
- Your pals will feast tonight.
- We don't need food and water.

296
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,076
We're safe in here.

297
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,872
My tanks have been hit by everything.

298
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,075
In Mongolia once...

299
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,993
...RPG. Direct hit.

300
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,672
Commander, gunner
and turret went flying.

301
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,876
I drove the rest of the tank back.

302
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,470
These tanks today are better.

303
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,318
Much better.

304
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,594
Sir, I can't hold it much longer.

305
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,791
Sir! Sir!

306
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,718
- How many?
-20 to 25, they're everywhere.

307
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,669
- Battle stations.
- I don't think they see us.

308
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,435
- They're in RPG range.
- Wait.

309
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,359
- Gunner, troops, frag.
- Frag's up, sir.

310
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,870
- Identify.
- I can't identify. It's too dark.

311
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,878
- Go to IR.
- IR is busted!

312
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,071
They're all around us, sir.

313
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,477
Standby to traverse left, 360.
All weapons fire at my command.

314
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,238
Traverse. Fire!

315
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,079
Cease fire!

316
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,715
All dead, sir.

317
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,798
- Samad.
- Sir?

318
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,678
Go verify.

319
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,476
- Move it!
- Yes, sir.

320
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,471
Kaminski, stand down.

321
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,990
Koverchenko, get on the co-ax.

322
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,030
- Set Samad in your sights.
- What?

323
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,276
Take him now, he's a traitor.

324
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,271
Are you insane?

325
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,316
Your insubordination demoted you
from Intelligence to this tank.

326
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,875
Your next stop is prison.

327
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,675
With your record,
I wouldn't disobey another order.

328
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,512
Take Samad now.

329
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,874
No.

330
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,959
How many dead?

331
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,671
It's deer, sir.

332
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,913
It's a herd of deer.

333
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,552
The Russian kills just to kill.

334
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,508
- We're leaking oil.
- Raise the snorkel, seal the cannon.

335
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,669
- Are we going underwater, sir?
- The rebels are following our tracks.

336
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,073
Samad, stop it.

337
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,473
- "m in my prayers, sir.
- Get up.

338
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,433
If I can reconcile dialectical
materialism and Allah...

339
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,471
...isn't that my business?

340
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,068
Why don't you trust me?
You know "m a member of the Party.

341
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,556
My son's in Moscow, sir.
You think "d compromise him?

342
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,079
I said get up.

343
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,434
See how deep the river is.

344
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,273
How, sir?

345
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,672
Walk in it.

346
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,071
You don't need that.

347
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,670
- Like ice, sir.
- I didn't ask for the temperature.

348
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,074
Is the bottom mud or stone?

349
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,473
Stone.

350
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,068
Why?

351
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,390
- I said why?!
- Shut up!

352
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,352
What are you doing?

353
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,676
- Recording this.
- Add your name.

354
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,874
- This'll get you a court-martial.
- So will killing your own men!

355
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,872
You would have done the same thing.

356
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,676
Samad was waiting for a chance
to give this tank to the enemy.

357
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,270
I was too smart for him.

358
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,269
And I didn't study philosophy.

359
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,078
I read your dossier, Mr. Intellectual.

360
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,677
What do you think it says about you?

361
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,269
That I think for myself.

362
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,674
You think for yourself.

363
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,478
When I was 8, defending Stalingrad,
I didn't think for myself.

364
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,758
When Russia asked for our lives,
we gave.

365
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,431
My father and mother didn't think
of themselves, they gave!

366
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,076
My brother didn't think
of himself, he gave!

367
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,558
My comrades lowered me
on top of Nazi tanks.

368
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,548
I stuffed Molotovs under
turret and cannon...

369
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,069
...then they pulled me up again.

370
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,076
They called me Tank Boy.

371
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,678
I took a lot of Nazi tanks.

372
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,993
A lot.

373
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,635
Over the years,
"ve learned to smell a traitor.

374
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,519
- How bad is it?
- You mean the tank?

375
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,709
Do you think he's snapped, huh?

376
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,152
- What are you doing?
- What?

377
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,158
You want to be next?
Don't talk to him.

378
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,269
- How far can we go?
- Not far enough.

379
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,150
We should ditch this bitch...

380
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,397
...dismantle the gun,
walk to Kandahar Road!

381
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,030
What are you whispering about?

382
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,509
Kaminski had an interesting idea.

383
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,639
Ditching the tank and walking back.

384
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,714
He's a fucking liar, sir.

385
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,159
As a man who thinks for himself,
what do you think?

386
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,399
Well, sir...

387
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,388
...the roadwhee"s cracked,
he drank our brakes...

388
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,512
...the battery's low,
we're losing oil.

389
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,518
If the engine heats up,
it'll seize.

390
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,358
We have no rations.

391
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,434
The mujas don't seem to run on
anything we know of...

392
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,511
...and they have an RPG.

393
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,270
Their aim is getting better.

394
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,991
You admire them, don't you?

395
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,036
- They've got us on the run.
- What do you suggest? Surrender?

396
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,590
That's a direct violation
of Soviet military law.

397
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,950
But you're all for it, aren't you?
That's mutiny.

398
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,119
Try it!

399
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,192
- Get his weapon. Cover him.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,836
Golikov, get some rope.

401
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,631
Now!

402
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,755
Tie him up.

403
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,637
I'll haunt you.
I'll be your worst nightmare.

404
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,239
Shut up.

405
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,638
You hear me?

406
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,276
- Don't be an idiot.
- I don't believe this.

407
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,879
Hold still, asshole.

408
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,196
- What are we doing?
- Shut up!

409
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,636
- Stepped in this one himself.
- Fucking lackey.

410
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,474
Fuck.

411
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,630
- Get the logbook.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,630
- He doesn't have it. It's in the tank.
- Booby-trap him.

413
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,869
- Yes, sir.
- Twisted and insane. Don't be an idiot.

414
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,399
Don't move.

415
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,630
If you need anything, just nod.

416
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,039
- Konstantin, "m sorry.
- Anton.

417
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,669
Anton, you're next.

418
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,634
Go blow his brains out,
come back and untie me.

419
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,239
- You're next.
- I can't.

420
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,070
You hear me, Anton?
Don't leave me here. Don't leave me.

421
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,998
- I can't.
- Untie me!

422
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,518
You're a good soldier.

423
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,269
They can depend on you
to shoot your mother.

424
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,119
Golikov! Goddamn it!

425
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,909
Don't leave me here, you coward!

426
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,556
Golikov, you fuck!

427
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,230
- I think you did the right thing.
- I appreciate that, Kaminski.

428
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,228
And I think I speak for all of us
when I say that.

429
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,752
What he wrote could close doors
for the rest of your lives.

430
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,912
I don't know why
you didn't just kill him.

431
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,634
I was trying to buy us some time.

432
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,192
Tank's roomier now, sir.

433
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,789
Sherina!

434
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,637
What are you doing here?

435
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,634
Akbar, we would fight
the tank with you.

436
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,196
You have no weapons.

437
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,759
Get back to the village, woman!... Go!

438
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,877
Uncle...

439
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,877
...am I fit to be Khan?

440
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,273
To ask that question makes you Khan.

441
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,916
When The Beast is dead, we will return.

442
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,552
I will be waiting.

443
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,231
There it is. Kandahar Road.

444
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,438
Kaminski, we're home!

445
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,395
We're almost out of petrol.

446
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,838
- Make it to the road.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,877
- Stop tank.
- What?

448
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,839
Stop tank. Stop tank!

449
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,834
Sir, "m sure I can make it,
it's only-

450
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,875
Please...

451
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,349
Untie my hands.

452
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,870
Afghan women, turn your grief to stone!

453
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,319
Stop!

454
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,433
Jesus. Stop!

455
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,108
Please, stop. Stop!

456
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,589
<i>Nanawatai!</i>

457
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,598
Sherina, how did you find us?

458
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,870
It was Allah's will...

459
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,912
We found him tied to the rock.

460
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,551
You take the honor, Taj.

461
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,711
<i>Nanawatai!</i>

462
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,434
He asks for mercy.

463
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,197
<i>I teach you another word - Badal!
Blood for blood!</i>

464
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,359
Silence, woman!

465
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,795
You speak Afghan?

466
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,359
What's your name?

467
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,999
A crow can speak a word,

468
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,437
but a crow is not a man,
and neither is a Russian.

469
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,828
Kill him!

470
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,679
If we dishonor our code and slay him
we are no better than the infidels.

471
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,433
...but why was he abandoned
by the tank?

472
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,191
<i>Nanawatai is for Afghans.</i>

473
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,638
If he is an enemy of our
enemy, then he is a friend.

474
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,831
Let us look to our guest.

475
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:37,831
Eat.

476
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,189
Choke.

477
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,230
You broke it when you dropped it.

478
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,310
So? David took Goliath
with just a stone.

479
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,838
It's an RPG.

480
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,719
It's kaput.

481
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,916
Oh, kaput.

482
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,514
Fix.

483
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,075
I fix, I fix.

484
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,033
- Kaput.
- Kaput.

485
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,632
Enfield.

486
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,714
Enfield.

487
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,469
I need Enfield to fix the RPG.

488
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,919
Thanks.

489
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,917
Now he has ruined two of our weapons!

490
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,874
This one is truly sent from Allah!

491
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,195
Kaboom.

492
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,869
Exactly.

493
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,233
That's a tank.

494
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,512
- Tank.
- Yeah, tank.

495
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,913
RPG...

496
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,519
...kaboom...

497
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,709
...tank.

498
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,152
RPG kaboom tank.

499
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,114
<i>Da...</i>

500
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,313
...RPG...

501
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,954
...kaboom...

502
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,519
...tank.

503
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,919
He's Russian!

504
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,192
He knows how to use that...

505
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,400
...and they tried to kill him.

506
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,714
<i>Da kaboom tank.</i>

507
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,791
Yeah, I'll kaboom tank.

508
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,039
Come on, man! Come on, get your shit.
Let's go!

509
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,712
Hey, you guys!

510
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,516
I can't believe it.

511
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,951
- Where did you guys come from?
- Oh, this is beautiful!

512
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,113
- We are so glad to see you guys.
- Oh, my God!

513
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:45,548
If we hadn't been looking for water,
we'd have never found you guys.

514
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,028
Climb aboard.
I'll call in for a strike on the tank.

515
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,439
Nobody wastes my tank.

516
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,631
Get back in the tank.

517
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,917
- What for?
- Because I said so.

518
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,629
- We're going home, sir.
- Yes, in the tank.

519
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,236
Why can't we go home
in the fucking helicopter?!

520
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,998
Because you're tankers.

521
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,720
Yeah, you're also in a cul-de-sac.

522
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,590
The only way out is back through
that pass you came through.

523
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,397
We'll go back the same way we got in.

524
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,118
You got any extra water?

525
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,790
No. You two, load the extra fuel
onto the tank.

526
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,231
Radio for more fuel
to meet us at the pass.

527
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,712
Jesus, what an asshole!

528
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,838
What are we doing?

529
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,839
- Why don't we make a run for it?
- Are you fucking crazy?

530
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,554
He'd shoot us right out of the sky.

531
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,756
The tank is leaving!

532
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,030
The pass... The pass!

533
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,119
It's turning back for the pass!

534
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,873
What, what?

535
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,597
- Tank.
- Yeah, I know. What?

536
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,109
Tank.

537
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,719
Tank.

538
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,112
It's a dead end, it's a dead end.

539
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,593
The pass. He's going to the pass.

540
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,429
Why the pass?
Why didn't he get in the helicopter?

541
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,428
The bastard won't leave his tank.
He won't leave it.

542
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,510
He's gone. He's gone.

543
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,113
Tank mountains?

544
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,515
Mountains...

545
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,112
He's got to go around
to get to the pass.

546
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,840
A shortcut? You know a shortcut?

547
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,435
- Tank.
- Shortcut. I understand.

548
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,312
I understand.

549
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,389
Konstantin.

550
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,872
Konstantin! Khan.

551
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,555
- Sir, the engine's hot.
- Maintain 20 kilometres an hour.

552
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,234
Sir, the radiator needs water.

553
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,031
- Keep going.
- Goddamn it!

554
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,913
The engine's gonna seize up.

555
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,909
Keep going. Waterhole's not far.

556
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,630
You think they radioed back?

557
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,631
Of course they did.

558
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,428
I hate this fucking country.

559
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,631
Fill the radiator.

560
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,078
Battle stations!

561
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,912
Mujahedeen! One thousand metres!

562
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,632
Crank it up.

563
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,670
- Traversing left.
- Come on, baby.

564
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,630
Give me power to the tank!

565
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,915
Shit! I can't, sir, she won't start!

566
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,517
Go to master battery!

567
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,031
Shit! The battery's dead, sir!

568
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,990
- Get us out of here!
- "m trying, sir! It's overheated!

569
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,634
Manual traverse left!

570
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,638
Gunner! Frag!

571
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,474
- We're out of frag, sir!
- Anything!

572
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,559
I got heat up!

573
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,757
Goddamn it. Come on!

574
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,074
On the way.

575
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,670
Spread out! Spread out!

576
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,149
Up!

577
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,633
On the way!

578
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,231
They're in RPG range, sir!

579
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,113
Come on!

580
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,468
I got it, sir!

581
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,112
Tank! Kaput! Now!

582
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,356
Moustafa! Come on!

583
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,032
I have what I want.

584
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,795
The Beast escapes!

585
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,550
Allah has tossed a peach
in our laps - Enjoy it!

586
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,359
Cousin, you are a pig!

587
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,391
Hasan, you are clever.

588
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,910
Can you learn a helicopter?

589
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,633
This way.

590
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,474
Shit!

591
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,280
They can't get us! We're too high!

592
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,072
You son of a bitch!

593
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,752
- Can't get elevation, he knows it.
- Who?

594
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,190
<i>- You're mine!
- Badal!</i>

595
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,870
- Keep it coming.
- Last round, sir!

596
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,192
- Reload!
- We're out!

597
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:33,112
- She's burning up!
- Make it to the pass!

598
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,478
Down!

599
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,995
Sir!

600
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,832
Rocket! I need the rocket!

601
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,428
Rocket! Throw!

602
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:37,914
Throw!

603
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,950
The pass is directly ahead!
One hundred metres!

604
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,677
- Faster, Kaminski!
- Yes, sir!

605
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,839
It only hit the muzzle!

606
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,194
We made it, sir! We made it!

607
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:50,228
Allah! Why have you forsaken us?

608
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,075
Goliath was covered with armor,
but just a rock brought him down!

609
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,192
<i>Badal!</i>

610
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,990
- We're off the track, sir.
- Oh, God.

611
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,078
Make a run for it, sir?

612
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:54,034
No. The gunships are coming.
We're safe in here.

613
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,393
- Fire!
- Close it!

614
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,038
Tank Boy!

615
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:15,276
I said, Tank Boy!
I got something for you, Tank Boy!

616
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,919
Koverchenko!

617
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,075
Kind of hot in there?

618
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,518
- Sir, they got us!
- Oh, shit!

619
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,833
- We gotta go up!
- We're gonna die in here!

620
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:38,432
- I want you, Tank Boy!
- Oh, shit!

621
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,469
You know our standing orders.

622
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,872
What?

623
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:58,074
Out of commission, become a pillbox.
Out of ammo, become a bunker.

624
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,271
Out of time, become heroes.

625
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:09,796
- You must be out of your fucking mind.
- Now, together.

626
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,272
Get the pin.

627
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,511
We're gonna die in here!

628
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:33,275
- You son of a bitch!
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

629
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,839
- Son of a bitch, get out!
- Don't shoot.

630
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,272
Shit!

631
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,838
Allah is too generous!

632
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:14,474
I didn't want to leave you out there.

633
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,311
- Take Daskal and let us go.
- Please don't let them kill me.

634
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,119
Get up.

635
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,996
Such unmanliness makes revenge unclean.

636
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,430
<i>Nanawatai shuravi.</i>

637
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,795
He will always be Russian.

638
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,470
Move aside and I will kill them all!

639
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,477
Tank kaput. Tank kaput.

640
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,276
<i>Nanawatai shuravi.</i>

641
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,469
Are you an angel or a devil?

642
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,911
Okay, take the boots.
Okay, take the helmet.

643
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,432
Okay, take the boots, take the boots.

644
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,833
Sorry, sir.

645
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,831
Not much of a war.

646
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,431
No Stalingrad.

647
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,632
How is it that
we're the Nazis this time?

648
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,038
How is that?

649
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,468
I'm trying to be a good soldier.

650
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,468
But you can't be a good soldier
in a rotten war, sir.

651
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,231
I want you to live to see them win.

652
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,674
Go.

653
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,875
I said, go!

654
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,676
<i>Badal!</i>

655
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,554
Afghanistan.

656
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,830
I don't understand you.

657
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,478
Konstantin.

658
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,632
Forgive me, my Khan...

659
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,038
Two escaped.
