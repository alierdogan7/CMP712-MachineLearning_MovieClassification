1
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,173
It's 4:00.

2
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,070
We are over Trollness again.

3
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,654
Look. Look. That flag.

4
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:23,190
- That's not ours.
- It's Norwegian.

5
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,656
Let's go down.

6
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:35,771
Our garrison headquarters
flying a Norwegian flag.

7
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,270
That's right. A Norwegian flag.

8
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,410
Suggest you investigate immediately.

9
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,944
Not a sign of life.

10
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,962
No smoke coming from the chimneys.

11
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,325
There can be fire without smoke.

12
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:29,349
Go away! Go away!

13
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,850
This is mine!

14
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,420
All mine! I own all this!

15
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,080
Go away! Go away, I tell you!

16
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,490
This is all mine. Go away!

17
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,554
Stop.

18
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:51,698
- What happened here?
- What happened here? What happened here?

19
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,739
The cannery, I built it.

20
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,142
Yes, I built it. With beautiful machines
that stamped out on millions of cans...

21
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:01,306
...Kaspar Torgersen, Torgersen,
Torgersen.

22
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,213
I owned half the boats.

23
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,253
Now I own them all. I own everything.

24
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,318
Hopelessly insane. Get rid of him.

25
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,983
Mine. Mine. Mine.

26
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,561
The landing party will be divided
into four groups.

27
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,189
Each group will scour a section of the town.
When they accomplished that...

28
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,268
...they will assemble at the hotel.
- Yes.

29
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:21,562
It's all mine.

30
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:30,367
If you're not too squeamish, lieutenant,
I would like to dictate a report.

31
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,508
At your service, Herr Hauptmann.

32
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,935
We entered the town of Trollness,
October 28th, 1942.

33
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,881
Former German garrison...

34
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:20,148
...commanded
by Hauptmann K-O-E-N-l-G.

35
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,420
Hauptmann Koenig.

36
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,761
Herr Major Ruck.

37
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,867
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler, Herr Major.

38
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,208
My credentials.

39
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,335
Please sit down, Herr Major.

40
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:47,644
May I offer my apologies
for this surprise visit?

41
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,612
I'm a member of the führer's bodyguard
attached to the Academy of War Sciences.

42
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:56,246
- Of course. Of course, Herr Major.
- Sit down. Don't be alarmed.

43
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,717
We discovered
we obtain our best results...

44
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,557
...by not announcing our arrival
beforehand.

45
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:06,931
In Berlin I have seen the files from all the
commands of the central Norwegian coast.

46
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:11,830
You are mentioned as a student of tactics,
a good disciplinarian, worthy of promotion.

47
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,671
- Herr Major means...
- Sit down. That's not what I have come for.

48
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,605
- Can we be overheard?
- No, Herr Major.

49
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:21,545
I will be brief.

50
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,254
I stopped at every station
between here and Trondheim.

51
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:31,257
On one point, there is dissatisfaction
both in the general staff and in Berlin.

52
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,553
It is the attitude of the Norwegians
toward our troops.

53
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,197
I've come here to correct it.

54
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,232
I want all the available information
concerning your town.

55
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,370
Facts, figures, et cetera.

56
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,066
This is Trollness.

57
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:49,302
Main industry, fishing.

58
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:52,174
The cannery, it employs
about a hundred men and women.

59
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,976
A few shopkeepers, a few professionals.

60
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:59,713
In the hills, a few scattered farms.
Total population, a little under 800 persons.

61
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:03,518
Against them, our German garrison
of 150 men...

62
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,957
...well-equipped, well-seasoned troops.

63
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,720
This hotel is our headquarters.

64
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,161
Breastworks have been put up,
trenches dug.

65
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,460
Machine guns are scattered
all over the town.

66
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,628
I can defend this town against anything,
except an attack by sea.

67
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,434
A revolt would be crushed
within an hour.

68
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:22,203
I compliment you on your thoroughness,
Hauptmann Koenig.

69
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,005
Thank you, Herr Major.

70
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,411
I have been working on a plan every night
since I've been here.

71
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,849
It's not just a plan for this town alone,
but a master plan for all occupied territories.

72
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,852
- lf Berlin accepts...
- Sent it to Berlin?

73
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:37,424
Yes, I have.
And I expect an answer by the next boat.

74
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:40,187
If they accept it,
I hope I shall be transferred.

75
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,092
To the Russian front, preferably.

76
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,927
- You don't like it here, Hauptmann Koenig?
- I'm a soldier.

77
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,228
It's one thing to fight soldiers.

78
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,394
Those are ghosts.

79
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,335
- Then there is trouble here too?
- Nothing you can put your finger on.

80
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,969
Once in a while, a fire breaks out,
a boat is sunk, a wire is cut...

81
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:00,047
...a shipment of fish is spoiled.

82
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:02,207
The kettle boils.

83
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,445
It's clear this town is no different
from many others.

84
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,521
Yes. Especially of late.

85
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,955
The underground newspaper
keeps the people excited and stirred up...

86
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:14,790
...with their silly tales
of commando raids, guerrilla warfares...

87
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,454
...our losses in Russia.

88
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,726
After all,
I can hardly be expected to take...

89
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:22,769
I have carried out
all military regulations to the letter.

90
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:24,530
Blackout every night after curfew.

91
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,470
- Precautionary searches...
- I am sure you have.

92
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,611
One thing more.
My stay here will be brief.

93
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,213
A few days at most.

94
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,111
I shall want a list of all the troublemakers
in this town.

95
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:38,879
Ha, ha, ha. I would have to give you the
name of every man, woman and child.

96
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,580
- The leaders, do you know who they are?
- Every one.

97
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:45,989
We begin right here in the hotel,
right where my soldiers are quartered.

98
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,357
<i>The woman downstairs, the innkeeper...</i>

99
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:51,796
<i>...her father was shot as a hostage
when we first took over the town.</i>

100
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:54,565
<i>She steals army food
from the commissariat...</i>

101
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,466
...and distributes it in the village.

102
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,473
<i>I close my eyes to that
because she's very efficient otherwise.</i>

103
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,204
I took the liberty of fixing your chair.

104
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:10,375
You have a habit of tilting it back
and I noticed that the legs were too weak.

105
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,143
Try it.

106
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,786
Don't be afraid. I'm a good carpenter.

107
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,760
You always have flowers on the table.

108
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,126
My dead wife loved flowers.

109
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,495
You bear such a strong resemblance
to her.

110
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,604
I'm busy. I have work to do.

111
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:35,138
Yes, I know. Too much for a woman.

112
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:41,542
This could be a fine hotel.
It needs a man around to fix things.

113
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,081
I'm a good carpenter.

114
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,218
You're a German.

115
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,889
<i>Now, for the rest of them,
here in the town.</i>

116
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,757
<i>There is Jensen, the shoemaker.</i>

117
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:01,732
<i>He is sly. He bears watching.</i>

118
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,899
<i>Solveig Brategaard, the baker's widow.</i>

119
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:10,906
<i>Her husband was shot,
but she carries on his work against us.</i>

120
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,512
Petersen, the butcher.

121
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,017
<i>He will run amuck some day.</i>

122
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,585
<i>Old man Mortensen, the tailor.</i>

123
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,320
<i>His son was arrested in Oslo. He is bitter.</i>

124
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,359
<i>Lars Malken, he runs the general store.</i>

125
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,700
<i>An old fool.
But he's useful to them for errands.</i>

126
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,235
<i>Karen Stensgard,
very active, very dangerous.</i>

127
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,345
<i>Daughter of the only doctor in town,
Martin Stensgard.</i>

128
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,743
- Where are you going?
- To Gunnar Brogge.

129
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,749
- Karen, I forbid it.
- What have you against him, Father?

130
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,443
- He's not for you.
- I think he is.

131
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,453
Germans will stand him up against a wall,
you along with him.

132
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:55,681
Someone has to fight.

133
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,520
I'm a good Norwegian.
I wanna hold this family together.

134
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,357
You're not the only one in Norway
that wants that. Good night, Father.

135
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,931
A few farmers.
They're not very important.

136
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,233
In the cannery, they are all against us.

137
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:15,343
- One with us.
- The owner?

138
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:16,569
Of course.

139
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,176
- Who is the leader among these rebels?
- A man called Brogge, Gunnar Brogge.

140
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,319
A fisherman, about 30.

141
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,149
Served in the Norwegian army
when we first came in.

142
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:30,349
Head of the fishermen's union
when they had one.

143
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,987
Why don't you make arrests?

144
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:35,924
If it comes to an open rebellion...

145
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:40,728
...I can assure you, Herr Major,
within ten minutes.

146
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,264
We're 150 against 800.

147
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,204
We could be 150 against 8000.

148
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,604
Eighty thousand.

149
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,940
We have guns and they are afraid to die.

150
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,448
This man Brogge, where does he live?

151
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:59,748
Here on the wharf in this shack.

152
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:18,238
I can sail the course to England
blindfolded.

153
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,541
The moon is bright tonight.

154
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,074
They won't see me.

155
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,546
Gunnar, maybe you could wait?

156
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,481
- For what?
- For another night, a darker one.

157
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:35,283
- I've had my fill of waiting.
- All right then, go, now.

158
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,030
Karen...

159
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,323
...you think this is easy for me?

160
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,230
I can't stand it here any longer.

161
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,600
More than two years now with the Nazi
without striking a blow.

162
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:53,674
Other Norwegians have gone to England.
They're doing something.

163
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,173
But you've been doing things.

164
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:57,835
- Everyone here depends on you.
- Yes.

165
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,208
"Gunnar, how long? Gunnar, when?

166
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,009
Will we get the arms, Gunnar?"

167
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,652
And we wait. And they never come.

168
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:08,222
- So you leave us.
- I must.

169
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:09,649
You leave me.

170
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,664
Go now or I shall hold you.

171
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,355
Into the other room.

172
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,370
Gunnar.

173
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,006
- Gunnar.
Karen.

174
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:15,488
Hammer, what happened?
What are you doing here in Trollness?

175
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:18,627
- In Stoksund, revolt.
- What?

176
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:22,127
- There's a revolt in Stoksund.
- How? When?

177
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:23,889
Gunnar, I walked here.

178
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,057
- Talk.
- I can't.

179
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,896
A bullet here.

180
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:33,768
Karen, take him to Osterholm's farm.
It's not far.

181
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:36,638
Gunnar, I can't walk anymore.

182
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,712
Then crawl. Did you hear that bugle?

183
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:41,111
Koenig must have gotten the news
from Stoksund.

184
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,047
They'll send patrols.
They'll search every house for arms.

185
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,710
This is the first house they'll come to.

186
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,287
The patrol.

187
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:57,226
The trap, quick.

188
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,933
Hang on under the wharf until they leave.
Stay in the water then use the rowboat.

189
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,474
Hammer, please,
try to hold on a little longer.

190
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:11,908
Open up in there.

191
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,346
Open up in there!

192
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:23,548
We have orders to search the place.
All right.

193
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,805
Come here.

194
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,975
What is this for?

195
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,547
That?

196
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,944
Oh, I fish down there
when it's stormy and I'm afraid to go out.

197
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,490
All right. Hurry up there. You too.

198
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,340
What's this?

199
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,412
I was fixing my net.
You banged so hard on the door...

200
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:27,248
...it startled me and I cut myself.

201
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,182
Now, with your permission, I'd like to go
to a doctor before I bleed to death.

202
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:07,924
There's no use crying anymore, Anna.
They have gone.

203
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:10,621
They had no right to search this house.

204
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,202
- They're searching every house, Anna.
- No. They had no right to search this house.

205
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,032
They're not searching
your brother's house.

206
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,876
Oh, I'm sorry, Anna.
I didn't mean to say that.

207
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,711
Anna, you'd better go upstairs
and go to bed.

208
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,821
It's after 9:00.

209
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,353
Martin.

210
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:38,823
It's just... I want them to treat you
with respect.

211
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:42,122
You're a doctor.
Doctors should be treated with respect.

212
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:43,924
Yes, Anna. Yes. Thank you.

213
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,966
Hulda, take Mrs. Stensgard upstairs.
It's after 9:00.

214
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,329
After 9:00.

215
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:52,200
In the old days, we used to sit up
until 11, sometimes 12.

216
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:53,705
Well, Hulda...

217
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,436
...we'll have to give this house
a thorough cleaning.

218
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,910
I hope that lamp the Germans broke
can be mended.

219
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,549
It was such a beautiful lamp.

220
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,254
- I cut my arm.
- What do you want?

221
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,455
A man is on his way
to Knut Osterholm's farm.

222
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,687
He's badly hurt.

223
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,531
- Who is he?
- A Norwegian.

224
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:21,191
Brogge, why don't you let me alone?

225
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,504
You're the only doctor in town.

226
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,155
Let us understand each other, Brogge.

227
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,285
It is my duty to heal the sick.

228
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,586
I go with you only because I am a doctor.

229
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:10,749
Please, Hammer.
It's just a little ways now.

230
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,880
I can't go any farther.

231
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,722
Send my daughter on a mission like this.
Maybe to her death.

232
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,365
Dr. Stensgard, please.

233
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,831
We're all as worried as you are.

234
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,989
- Karen, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

235
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,226
- You're wet, shivering. You're cold.
- Father, that man is in agony.

236
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,530
You must change your clothes.
You'll be sick.

237
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,265
Gerd has some dry clothes for you.

238
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:23,723
- Hammer.
- Here. Cut his sleeve.

239
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,189
Gunnar.

240
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:34,796
Gunnar.

241
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,767
You're all right now, Hammer.

242
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,166
You're all right.

243
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,240
Gunnar.

244
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,876
Listen.

245
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,975
Important.

246
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,242
I got out.

247
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:47,809
No one else.

248
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,114
From the beginning.

249
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:54,287
- From the beginning, Hammer.
- This man is in no condition to talk.

250
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,584
He must be quiet. Quiet. Hold the light.

251
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,317
Will he live?

252
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:03,425
I don't know.

253
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,566
- What are you doing?
- Putting him to sleep.

254
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:08,828
- Supposing he doesn't come out of it?
- Then let him die in peace.

255
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,870
Hammer, listen to me.

256
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,101
- Are you listening?
- This is a human being, Brogge.

257
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,268
I'll ask questions. You answer.

258
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,678
The skin has burned off his face.
It's agony for him to move his lips.

259
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,647
How did the revolt start?

260
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,252
We got arms.

261
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,846
They got arms.

262
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,991
I've known you all my life as kind,
decent people.

263
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,592
Hammer, how did you get the arms?

264
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,484
He's going to sleep.

265
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,494
I could kill you for this.

266
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,792
Hammer, you've got to hold on.

267
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,229
How did you get the arms?

268
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,938
The English.

269
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,606
They're...

270
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,474
They're...

271
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,409
What, Hammer? What?

272
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:56,248
Delivering arms,
all up and down the coast.

273
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:57,749
Not to us, they haven't.

274
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:00,678
- They will.
- Are you sure, Hammer?

275
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:04,517
Hammer, are you sure?

276
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,189
Yes.

277
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:09,189
Sure.

278
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,696
I'm sure.

279
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,461
Sure.

280
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,200
Hear that? Did you hear what he said?

281
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:19,704
We're gonna get arms from the British.
He was sure.

282
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,866
- Arms.
- At last.

283
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,512
God help us.

284
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,939
God help us all.

285
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,111
Goodbye.

286
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,491
How many mornings we've said goodbye
on these steps?

287
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,490
Will there be one more morning, Gunnar?

288
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:17,795
I must make arrangements to get Hammer
across the border into Sweden.

289
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:25,830
Before he goes,
we must hold a meeting in the church.

290
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,384
It's important that in receiving the arms
the whole town be with us.

291
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:42,182
They'll be with us. They'll follow you.

292
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:43,915
Thanks.

293
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:48,962
All right, Gunnar.
I'm through crying now.

294
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,596
Karen, I gave you many reasons
for wanting to go to England.

295
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,735
I don't care now why you wanted to go.

296
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,637
All I care is that you're staying.

297
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:00,735
- But there was one reason I didn't give you.
- Yes?

298
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,367
You.

299
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:04,171
I worried about you.

300
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:07,281
I was afraid
that if anything happened to you, l...

301
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:09,041
I might lose my head.

302
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,208
Then I wouldn't be
of much use anymore.

303
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:14,516
But now I stay. Now, I've got to stay.

304
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:17,021
Karen, if were going to fight...

305
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:20,020
...we have to be like steel.

306
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,156
Yes, Gunnar.

307
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,470
I'll have some more butter, please.

308
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,041
There isn't any more, ma'am.

309
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,373
There won't be any more
until the day after tomorrow.

310
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,514
Good morning, Mother, Father.
Good morning, Karen.

311
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,775
Good morning, darling.

312
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:46,352
- How pretty she looks. You slept well.
- Wonderfully, Mother.

313
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,013
Oh, I'm so glad you weren't here last night
when the Germans came.

314
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:54,123
I was visiting the pastor's wife.
She's not feeling very well.

315
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:56,696
You must've stayed late.
I didn't hear you come in.

316
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,025
Did you hear her, Martin?

317
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:01,401
- No. No, I didn't.
- I'll help you straighten out the house.

318
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:05,005
Yes.
Yes, this house must be straightened out.

319
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:09,109
- This house must look as pretty as you do.
- Isn't she sweet?

320
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,012
Darling, I had a dream.

321
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:17,174
I had a wonderful dream.
I dreamt things were like they used to be.

322
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:19,616
I had made a great big supper...

323
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:22,723
...and we sat around the table
talking, laughing.

324
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,793
Your father drank a little bit too much,
fell asleep just the way he used to do.

325
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,588
And Uncle Kaspar told stories...

326
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:31,425
...about how he worked his way up
in the world.

327
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,126
And you were playing the piano
and Johann was singing.

328
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:38,397
- Wasn't that a beautiful dream?
- Yes, Mother.

329
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,973
Darling, that wasn't a dream.
That's the truth.

330
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:45,841
That's just the way it's going to be.
Johann is coming home.

331
00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:49,111
Johann's coming home?

332
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,311
Well, aren't you glad?

333
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,612
Yes, Mother.

334
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:00,091
I got the letter this morning.
I must have read it 20 times.

335
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,587
No. No, it isn't in my pocket.
It's upstairs.

336
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,165
I'll go and get it. I'll read it to you.

337
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,535
I didn't even know he was coming
until your mother got the letter.

338
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:18,611
I didn't send for him.

339
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,711
- Who did?
- Your uncle.

340
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:25,250
- Birds of a feather.
- Karen, Johann is your brother.

341
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,878
In Oslo, in 1940 when the Germans came,
he was one of the first...

342
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:32,254
- He didn't know what he was doing.
- He knew.

343
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:34,691
His whole world was crumbling.
He was bewildered.

344
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:38,127
I have seen men stood up against a wall
with the Germans.

345
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,462
They had more to lose than he did.
Wives, children.

346
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,799
Their world was crumbling too.
They weren't bewildered.

347
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:48,838
Karen, we are not all strong.

348
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,171
There are some of us that are weak.

349
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:54,907
- When he comes, what will you do?
- Villagers of Trollness are his countrymen.

350
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,246
- They will be his judges.
- They don't have to know.

351
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,916
Why must everything in the world
be either black or white?

352
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,921
That's the way the world is these days.

353
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,287
Johann may have changed. Men repent.

354
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:10,056
Why don't you wait and see for yourself?
Let your mother see him once more.

355
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:13,325
If he doesn't come home now,
she probably never will again.

356
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:17,569
Would it be better
if she were to find out?

357
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,733
We can keep that from her.
We've kept everything else.

358
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:24,174
Karen, let her dream come true.

359
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,973
There are so few dreams left that do.

360
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:29,850
Poor father.

361
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,245
- Poor father.
- There were good things in the old life.

362
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:35,582
Don't tear up everything by the roots.

363
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,749
Maybe, when this is over,
we'll all wanna pick where we left off.

364
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:43,687
Karen, please. Two years is a long time.
A man can change.

365
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,426
Let him stay here in peace. Let him feel
there is still a home to come to...

366
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:50,469
...that there is still a place
where people love each other.

367
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,304
Father, I say this for your sake
and for his sake.

368
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,879
If you can still stop him from coming,
do it.

369
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:02,748
- Father, promise me you'll try.
- All right, I'll try.

370
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:31,243
Why do you come to see me
in the middle of the day?

371
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,108
I'm a busy man.
I have troubles of my own.

372
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:38,448
Well, whatever it is, come on,
say it and get it over with.

373
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:43,281
Kaspar, why did you send for Johann?

374
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,550
Because I need him.

375
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:47,320
He should stay in Oslo
and finish his education.

376
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:48,985
Ha, why do you lie to yourself?

377
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,597
He hasn't been near a classroom
in almost two years.

378
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,757
That's a fact.
I'm a man who deals in facts.

379
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,698
If he comes here, there'll be trouble.

380
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,237
No trouble. Johann's a smart boy.
He understands the new order.

381
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,136
Write him. Tell him not to come home.

382
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,301
You will tell him to stay where he is,
to go back to school.

383
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,880
Tell you daughter it's too late.
He's on the boat. He'll be here Sunday.

384
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,880
I don't want you to get him mixed up.

385
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,713
Your daughter doesn't want me
to get him mixed up.

386
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:15,515
- Let him alone.
- Your daughter wants me to let him alone.

387
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,681
Anything happens,
I'll hold you responsible.

388
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,157
Why is Karen so worried
about his coming here?

389
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:22,626
This is a peaceful village.

390
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:25,064
Or maybe it isn't.

391
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,895
Maybe there's something going on.

392
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:31,436
Something you ought to tell
your brother-in-law about.

393
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,073
Well?

394
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,606
Well, well?

395
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:38,542
Facts. Give me facts.
I'm a man who deals in facts.

396
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:43,106
I can't understand.
You're an educated man. A clever man.

397
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:47,015
A man who's been willing to take advantage
of every opportunity that came along.

398
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:50,089
Now when the greatest opportunity
of a lifetime comes along...

399
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:52,783
...you flounder like a fish out of water.

400
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:56,154
What is it? You want to be a patriot?

401
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,767
Well, it's men like us
who are the real patriots of Norway.

402
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,458
Shut your fat, evil mouth!

403
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,536
The polite doctor shouts.

404
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:07,141
The cultured gentleman raises his voice.

405
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:11,635
What's the matter, Martin,
holding out for a bigger price?

406
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,107
Hauptmann Koenig.

407
00:32:17,318 --> 00:32:19,650
Good morning, Dr. Stensgard.
Herr Torgersen.

408
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,413
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

409
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:24,080
- It is exactly 11.
- Everything is arranged.

410
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:27,955
- The men are waiting for you.
- Excellent, Herr Torgersen, excellent.

411
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:31,528
Did you hear what he said?
"Excellent, Herr Torgersen."

412
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,031
And you slapped me.

413
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:41,473
There've been incidents
in this cannery in direct defiance...

414
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:43,770
...of the order
of the German high command.

415
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:47,346
Let me remind you how the order reads.

416
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,243
"The economic life of a country
occupied by German troops is to continue.

417
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,516
Everyone is to remain at his position
and continue with his work as before.

418
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,626
Any acts to the contrary are sabotage."

419
00:32:59,994 --> 00:33:01,723
I have been lenient, heretofore.

420
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,659
If there are any more accidents...

421
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:06,698
...if there are any more attempts
to spoil the fish...

422
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:10,827
...such as making them unfit for
consumption by kerosene or other means...

423
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:16,238
...men will be chosen at random
and tried for sabotage by a military court.

424
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,709
I will impose stricter measures
on the town.

425
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,212
Forbid public gatherings.
Close the church.

426
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:23,714
- Tonight at the church.
Fishing will be forbidden.

427
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:26,115
The cannery will be shut down.

428
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,617
We got arms from the British.

429
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:37,026
We were told to wait for the day
the entire coast was armed.

430
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,189
We couldn't. We were betrayed.

431
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:43,497
Some quisling must have told the Germans
the guns were buried in our gardens.

432
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,468
They came with searching parties.

433
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,108
Then it started. House to house.

434
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,609
The men defending themselves.
What else could they do?

435
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,011
Possession of arms meant death anyway.
It was like a blood bath.

436
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:59,176
They offered us a truce on their terms.

437
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,116
We told them to go to the devil.

438
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,784
How were you situated?
How many of you?

439
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:44,363
A hundred and four.

440
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:48,093
One machine gun
and 2000 rounds for the rifles.

441
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,033
We were facing them
with our backs to the water.

442
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:55,039
On the other flank, we had a little hill
which we could keep pretty well covered.

443
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,973
That's how we stood
when the attack started.

444
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:02,378
About that time was when young
Olav Brande tried to launch the boat.

445
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,018
Olav Brande was a friend of my son.

446
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,120
The one who was arrested in Oslo
for cutting wires.

447
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:08,380
Shh.

448
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:11,047
He called to women and children
to get in the boats...

449
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:14,854
...and he'd set them adrift until
it was over, but they couldn't make it.

450
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,589
The Germans raked the wharf
with machine gun fire.

451
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,597
The women and children?

452
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:24,033
Most of them were lying on pilings under
the wharf. You could hear them crying.

453
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,298
What happened to the women
and children?

454
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:29,034
Those that tried to run for the boats
were shot.

455
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,613
There's no time for tears. Be quiet.

456
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:37,745
Go on.

457
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,944
We fought until dark and held them off.

458
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,453
About 9:00, their firing stopped.

459
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,352
We sat back and began to talk over...

460
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,722
...whether or not we could make the boats
in the dark.

461
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,261
There had to be a way out.

462
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,796
Then the planes came.

463
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:54,093
They sent down flares and then dived.

464
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:56,327
Houses started bursting into flames.

465
00:35:56,504 --> 00:36:00,167
First one, then another.
The whole fjord was yellow.

466
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,969
Even the trees were on fire.

467
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,242
I guess that's all.

468
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:09,141
Stoksund was a nice town.

469
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:12,184
Once I was gonna open a butcher shop
in Stoksund...

470
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:14,184
...but my wife was against it.

471
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,918
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to be funny.

472
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,955
Hammer has told us that the English
are delivering arms up and down the coast.

473
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,928
We'll get them here.

474
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,095
You've heard what happened
in Stoksund.

475
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:31,200
That may also happen here.

476
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:32,964
Oh, no.

477
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,604
Not if you plan your strategy.

478
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,505
Lars Malken may be right.

479
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,612
That's another question.

480
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:43,214
The question now is,
do we agree to accept the arms?

481
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:45,249
Are we together when they come?

482
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,149
Each man should speak his mind here.
Now.

483
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:51,849
- You say the whole coast will be armed?
- Yes.

484
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:53,994
Then what is there to speak about?

485
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,857
Is there anyone here
who can't see what that means?

486
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:03,567
No, this is not the way.

487
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,740
Every man must speak his mind.

488
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:09,069
Pastor, what do you say?

489
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,608
I say it's wrong.

490
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:14,009
I say it's against God's will.
I say it's murder.

491
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,816
They slaughtered us in the streets
and you talk about murder.

492
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,147
Yeah, that's it.
- Wait.

493
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,689
Wait. You'll all have a chance to speak.
Let him have his say.

494
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,622
Believe me, I understand.

495
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:30,230
But do not infect us.
It would only make it worse.

496
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:33,333
By him who died on the cross,
I swear I'm no coward...

497
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,197
...but in my very soul,
I know this is wrong.

498
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,669
You are a man of God, pastor.
But in these times, you...

499
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,502
In these times,
I must cry out all the louder.

500
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,346
How can you trust a man
who talks like that?

501
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,209
God have mercy on you.

502
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:51,977
We pay you a good wage,
300 kroner a month...

503
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:54,053
...and now you turn on us.

504
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:56,086
I am not turning on you.

505
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,617
He has a right to say what he thinks.

506
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:01,421
That he has. Go on, pastor.

507
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:04,086
No, I've said my share.

508
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,657
And you, Dr. Stensgard?

509
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:09,394
- No, not now.
- Then it's settled.

510
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,266
No, not yet.

511
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,773
I don't agree with the pastor,
but there are doubts in my mind.

512
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:19,709
You doubt. But my son in Oslo
was arrested for cutting wires.

513
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,745
To the devil with your son in Oslo.

514
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:24,180
- You're a traitor.
- I'm a farmer.

515
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:27,185
If I lose my farm,
there must be a reason for it.

516
00:38:27,355 --> 00:38:31,382
The sacrifice of one poor village,
what will it accomplish?

517
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,026
What sacrifice?

518
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:37,255
What are you giving up? Your life?

519
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:40,366
Maybe they'll take that from you
whether you fight or not.

520
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,800
Your farm? It isn't yours anyway
until you fight for it.

521
00:38:45,106 --> 00:38:46,573
Your peace?

522
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,609
What peace is there when a body of troops
can come in the middle of the night...

523
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:53,576
...and arrest you as a hostage
to be shot...

524
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,717
...for something you never did
or never even thought of?

525
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,182
Like my father.

526
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:03,954
To live in constant fear,
to have blackings at your windows...

527
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:08,494
...to talk in whispers,
to have guards at your church doors.

528
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,654
Do you have anymore objections?

529
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,924
All I did was ask a question.

530
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,833
A man has a right to ask a question.
I'm satisfied with the answer.

531
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:22,635
Sixtus Andresen, you're a man
for whom we all have respect.

532
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,301
You have taught our children,
even some of us.

533
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:27,208
We have found you to be wise.

534
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:30,976
- Surely in this matter, your wisdom...
- He's fallen asleep.

535
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:34,315
No, no, I was not asleep.

536
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:37,881
I was thinking what to say
when you asked me.

537
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,653
And I knew that you would ask me.

538
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:46,094
What can I say to you?
How can I advise you?

539
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:50,564
I find now that I've lived
more than 70 years...

540
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:54,105
...and all I know, I know from books.

541
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:59,907
And in all the books I've read, not one
do I remember that gives me an answer.

542
00:40:01,215 --> 00:40:03,911
Perhaps I read the wrong books.

543
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,580
Forgive me if I've failed you.

544
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:10,421
All this may prove a point.

545
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,491
Vote. Let's have the vote.

546
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,560
We are all Norwegians. I love my country
as much as you do. You must believe that.

547
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,699
What would you have us do,
Dr. Stensgard?

548
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:20,891
Wait.

549
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:23,832
A tidal wave has swept over us.
It'll recede. When it does...

550
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,266
We'll all be drowned.

551
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:29,136
Ask yourself these questions. Do you
want your country ravaged, homes burned?

552
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,710
Your children bombed
as they were in Stoksund?

553
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:34,712
Ask your children those questions.

554
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:42,081
All right. Take the vote.

555
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:45,385
All those in favor.

556
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,089
Hold on, Gunnar.

557
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:52,028
How do we know the pastor
and some others won't betray us?

558
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,598
No.

559
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,134
Dr. Stensgard won't betray you.

560
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,772
He's a good man. I work for him.

561
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,374
I know he won't betray you.

562
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,402
Excuse me.

563
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,208
Thank you, Hulda.

564
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:11,280
Those with us.

565
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:39,579
Don't try to go further than Olsen's farm.

566
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,806
It's too rough on a wounded man.
Good luck.

567
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,609
Don't worry about me.

568
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,688
- Just a minute.
- Run.

569
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:09,398
- What do you want?
- Do you want them to hear you?

570
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,408
Where's the guard? Don't they have one?

571
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,843
He's at the back.
He'll be around in a minute.

572
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:15,675
Who are you?

573
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:20,487
- Who's down there? I heard voices.
- I did not see anybody.

574
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,755
- Hauptmann Koenig.
- Not now. Later.

575
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,529
So you're Gunnar Brogge?

576
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:37,598
Lovely night, Miss Stensgard,
for running though the woods.

577
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,569
Feeling better, Sister Gerd? Good.

578
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,469
Now let's get down to business.

579
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:46,441
A dictionary. Oslo edition, 1937.

580
00:42:46,614 --> 00:42:49,082
I give it to you
in case we have no opportunity later.

581
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,411
- Who are you?
- A British agent.

582
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:54,577
- How do we know you speak the truth?
- You don't.

583
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:57,786
- When arms are landed in this village...
- We fight.

584
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,255
Gerd.

585
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:02,452
No. You wait. No matter what happens.

586
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,394
Keep your people in check
till the whole coast is armed.

587
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,932
Beginning tomorrow,
you'll have a man stationed...

588
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:12,004
...between midnight and 4 on the plateau
about half a mile up from the hotel.

589
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:16,309
He must keep a watch out to sea to a point
due west to the center of the village.

590
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:19,275
- Due west to the center.
- He will be signaled by a ship...

591
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:21,676
...lying 12 miles off coast.
- And then?

592
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,784
He will answer the signals
with 20 candlepower brilliance.

593
00:43:24,952 --> 00:43:27,250
One flash for yes, two for no.

594
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:29,013
Ten seconds between answers.

595
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,282
For each word,
we will flash two numbers.

596
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:35,053
The first designates page number, second
the number of the word on that page.

597
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:41,030
So 212-9 would mean page 212,
the ninth word.

598
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,896
Will you remember all that?

599
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,436
If I don't, she will.
She's a very educated girl.

600
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:50,600
Due west, 20 candlepower, one, yes,
two, no. Ten seconds between answers.

601
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:52,439
Page and word number in dictionary.

602
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:55,047
- Correct.
- You see? She went to college in Oslo.

603
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,944
When does this happen?

604
00:43:57,184 --> 00:44:00,153
Don't ask me. I only carry the news.

605
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:03,256
An Englishman in that uniform.
How do you do it?

606
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:05,051
Do I ask you how you catch fish?

607
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:19,598
I'll not be left out of things,
do you hear me?

608
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:22,901
Why wasn't I asked to the meeting
with Hammer at Osterholm's farm?

609
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,102
I'll make an issue of it.

610
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,279
Look here, Gunnar,
why don't you let me in on things?

611
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,610
Reason? I demand a reason.

612
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:33,048
Should I talk to him that way?

613
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,984
Or should I be clever,
wheedle it out of him?

614
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:38,021
You're wearing out your shoes.

615
00:44:38,192 --> 00:44:40,126
Leather is rationed too.

616
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:42,057
I'll show you.

617
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:47,491
I'll show all of you. I'm not useless.

618
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:50,000
You'll come to me yet,
Mr. Gunnar Brogge.

619
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,104
I'll show you how to beat the Germans.

620
00:44:55,142 --> 00:44:57,804
Go on up to the hotel. Start shooting.

621
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:03,006
Good morning.

622
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:05,583
Good morning.
- I want a bag for traveling.

623
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:31,970
- Is this the best you have got?
- This is all I've got.

624
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:35,238
- How much?
- Norwegian or German money?

625
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:37,077
I get paid by the Germans.

626
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:39,151
Twenty-two marks.

627
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:55,566
"Go up to the hotel," she says.
"Start shooting," she says. The old...

628
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,562
Hotel.

629
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:03,203
Say, maybe that's not such a bad idea.

630
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:36,165
- Hey, Paul, want a boat ride?
- We're going out to get the mail.

631
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:37,901
No, thanks.

632
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:46,079
Put the breakfast on the table.

633
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:48,982
Would you hand me a towel?

634
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:51,147
There's one on the bed.

635
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,917
Thank you.

636
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:58,730
Is there any news from the town?

637
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:05,397
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

638
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,097
What do you want?

639
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:12,371
I'm sorry to disturb you. l...
You thought I was somebody else.

640
00:47:12,946 --> 00:47:17,144
You remember me, don't you?
The shop and the bag?

641
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:19,808
What about it?
Did I pay you too much or too little?

642
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:22,478
Oh, no, no, no. It's not that l...

643
00:47:22,956 --> 00:47:25,424
I wanted to talk to someone.

644
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,789
Someone who'd been down
on the Continent since I was there.

645
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:30,759
I heard you were Polish.

646
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,456
I have a cousin in Warsaw.

647
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:37,627
And I thought, perhaps,
you might be dressed...

648
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:41,300
What was your cousin's name?

649
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:45,104
His... Malken same as mine.

650
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,769
Sit down.

651
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,710
Give me your hat.

652
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:51,544
What a beautiful new one it is.

653
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:53,982
Do you mind if I dress?

654
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,780
Is there any trouble in the town?

655
00:47:58,158 --> 00:48:00,126
Trouble? Why should there be trouble?

656
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:05,056
Tell me about your cousin.
I know a great many people in Warsaw.

657
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,593
Well, I think... I think...

658
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:12,705
Was he a Pole or a Norwegian?
What was his business there?

659
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:15,205
- Well, l...
- Was he in Warsaw during the siege?

660
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,867
- You mustn't ask me questions.
- Then tell me why you've come to see me.

661
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:22,640
I wanted you to help us.

662
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,249
To do what?

663
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:25,578
Well, I thought...

664
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:29,347
...see, you living in this hotel with
the Germans, you might have information.

665
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:32,856
- What kind of information?
- Well, we could use all kinds of information.

666
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:36,723
For instance, number of guns, where
they're placed, have they got a wireless?

667
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:39,058
What do you want that information for?

668
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:42,963
Well, you see,
everybody in town thinks I'm useless.

669
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:46,105
- I'm not. I thought if we could bring them...
- We?

670
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:49,069
Will you help us?

671
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,107
What makes you think I'd do this?

672
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:53,303
What good will your filthy money
do me here?

673
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,278
Think I'm crazy enough to get mixed up
in anything like this?

674
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,350
I'm leaving here. Today.
They promised me.

675
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:02,284
- Well, I don't know. I just thought...
- Oh, you fool. You fool.

676
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:06,025
Go before somebody finds you.

677
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,227
Go, go.
Do you want me to give you away?

678
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:12,622
Wait a minute. How did you get in here?

679
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:14,460
Through the corridor window.

680
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:18,469
If you don't want to get a good beating,
you better go out the same way you came.

681
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:20,034
You wait here.

682
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,539
I will go and see
if there's anybody in the hall.

683
00:49:34,454 --> 00:49:35,580
What are you looking at?

684
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:37,787
It isn't forbidden to look.

685
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,255
For you it is, you swine.

686
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:43,362
- You Polish sow.
- Go ahead. I dare you. I dare you to hit me.

687
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:47,194
You won't always be with the officers.

688
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:49,062
I can wait.

689
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,999
You will rot first!

690
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:15,918
Hello, Grandpa.

691
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,530
Oh, muscles. Heh, heh.

692
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,890
Not bad.

693
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:22,862
Teeth too.

694
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,129
Hey!

695
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:31,711
What's your hurry, Grandpa?

696
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,510
Look, men.
Look what came out of Katja's room.

697
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:38,378
Let me at him. I'm jealous.

698
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:40,711
No, no. Wait a minute.

699
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:45,517
Here. Before he dies, he's gonna tell us
the secret of his success with the ladies.

700
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:48,217
Let me go.
Before I tell you what I think of you.

701
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:50,260
What every honest man thinks of you.

702
00:50:51,898 --> 00:50:53,991
Quiet! Quiet, everybody!

703
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:56,226
All right, Grandpa, tell us.

704
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:15,348
Brave Nazis. Very brave indeed. But not
so brave when you're patrolling at night.

705
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:18,855
I've watched your faces. Somebody
slams the door, you think it's a shot.

706
00:51:19,025 --> 00:51:22,426
And how do you sleep at night?
Not very well. And why?

707
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:25,087
Because my Norway
has a fighting tradition.

708
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:27,358
There was Eric the Red.
There was lbsen.

709
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:30,162
You're dealing here with giants.

710
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,540
I could have told them all those things.

711
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,674
I didn't say a word.

712
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:04,799
Well, Johann.
You remember me, don't you?

713
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:07,371
- Of course. How are you, Brogge?
- Fine.

714
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,135
- I didn't know you were coming home.
- He surprised us.

715
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:13,074
Oh, surprise.
Well, that's the best kind of a visit.

716
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:15,976
I'm sorry. We have to hurry.
His mother is waiting.

717
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:23,449
Letter for Hauptmann Koenig
from Berlin.

718
00:52:23,623 --> 00:52:26,353
Maybe we'll be lucky
and they'll transfer him.

719
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:29,361
Berlin has said no to my plan.

720
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:31,895
They have ordered me to stay here.

721
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:34,023
Now I remain nothing.

722
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:36,635
A commander of a garrison.

723
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:40,500
A garrison
in which even my own troops hate me.

724
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:45,638
- You weren't listening.
- I was. But the boat is leaving...

725
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:47,279
You will not go to the boat.

726
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:50,109
You weren't listening.
You kept thinking about yourself.

727
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:51,716
- You promised.
- You are not.

728
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:53,978
You're staying.
Here in this hole like I am.

729
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:55,553
- You're staying.
- You promised!

730
00:52:55,722 --> 00:52:57,656
- You are staying!
- Liar! Liar!

731
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:00,657
You are staying!
- Liar! Liar!

732
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:18,177
Draw the curtains,
before someone sees me in here.

733
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:21,473
Weren't you taught to knock
before you enter someone's room?

734
00:53:21,648 --> 00:53:24,583
Please don't be angry with me. Help me.

735
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,445
I don't know what to do.

736
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,565
Hauptmann was quite upset.

737
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,930
- You heard?
- Yes.

738
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,631
- You're Polish, aren't you?
- Yes.

739
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,469
What are you doing here in Norway?

740
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:56,545
Well, you see, at the time
the Germans took my country...

741
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:59,549
...I was in Berlin on the stage.

742
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:03,153
Then they wanted me
to work in a factory.

743
00:54:03,423 --> 00:54:07,052
After all, they said, I was only a Pole.

744
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:10,920
I told them I was an actress.

745
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:15,261
Then they said
that before I could act anywhere again...

746
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:17,266
...I would have to prove my loyalty.

747
00:54:17,437 --> 00:54:21,305
And to prove it,
you agreed to come to Norway?

748
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:27,509
They promised I would only have to be here
a little while.

749
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:32,408
Now I have been here almost two years.

750
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:35,351
What do you want me to do about it?

751
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:47,198
I thought that since you are here,
a high officer...

752
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:52,134
...that maybe you would talk to
the hauptmann, get him to send me back.

753
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:54,532
I am afraid to stay here any longer.

754
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,700
- What are you afraid of?
- Everything.

755
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,277
The soldiers. This town.

756
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:03,541
There's something going to happen here.
I feel it.

757
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:08,677
Only today, a man came up from town
and wanted to know if I would help him.

758
00:55:08,855 --> 00:55:11,483
- Did you report him?
- No.

759
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:13,592
- Why not if you're loyal?
- I'm not loyal.

760
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,887
I'm not anything. I hate them.

761
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,121
I'll have you shot for such talk.

762
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:20,493
No, you won't.

763
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:24,360
I know you're not
what you pretend to be.

764
00:55:24,537 --> 00:55:26,664
I saw you talking to those people
last night.

765
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,068
It was I who warned you.

766
00:55:32,879 --> 00:55:35,780
I can't risk the fate of a whole village
just to help you.

767
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:38,417
- What must I do?
- You could do a lot.

768
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,882
You could help us all.

769
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:42,317
Remember the old man
who came and asked for help?

770
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:46,152
- No, no, I won't.
- You wanted me to tell you what to do.

771
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,489
I'm not going to get mixed up in anything
that will get me killed.

772
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:52,153
I want to get out of here alive.

773
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:59,161
Are you going to speak
to Hauptmann Koenig for me?

774
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:00,704
No.

775
00:56:04,144 --> 00:56:06,772
Do you want me to speak
to Hauptmann Koenig?

776
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,847
Now, before your boat leaves?

777
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:12,644
I could do it so easy.

778
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:13,979
Only a word.

779
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:17,447
One little word.

780
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:22,286
You'll find my shirts in the top drawer.
Will you bring them here?

781
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:24,247
Ten o'clock and we're still up,
just like in the old days.

782
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,723
I'd like...

783
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,320
I'd like to make a toast.

784
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,857
Father, Mother wants us to drink a toast.

785
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:37,930
Oh, I'm sleepy.

786
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,807
No, Martin, you are drunk.

787
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,843
- Hello, Hulda.
- Good evening, sir.

788
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:56,254
Well, it's a fine thing.

789
00:57:56,422 --> 00:58:00,153
My sister's son comes home, I'm not invited
to my sister's house to welcome him.

790
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:02,123
Oh, forgive me, Kaspar, I forgot.

791
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:04,957
- You see, there's so much excitement.
- Oh, forget it.

792
00:58:05,131 --> 00:58:08,362
- Welcome home, Johann.
- Uncle Kaspar.

793
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,366
Well, this is nice. Family life.

794
00:58:11,538 --> 00:58:14,439
Mother, father, children, all together.

795
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:19,209
I can see now I missed a lot
by never getting married.

796
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:21,040
But I have Johann.

797
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:23,774
Like a son he is to me, just like a son.

798
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,214
Now I can settle back
and take things easy.

799
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:29,549
You'll help your old uncle,
won't you, Johann?

800
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:34,125
Well, that's why I'm here, Uncle Kaspar,
to help you in the cannery.

801
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:43,595
Kaspar, we were just drinking a toast.
Will you join us?

802
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:51,170
Now, let me see,
what were we drinking to?

803
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:55,838
Oh, yes. To peace.
May peace come again and soon.

804
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,505
To a free Norway.

805
00:58:57,684 --> 00:58:59,515
I'll drink to that.

806
00:59:55,742 --> 00:59:57,369
From Trollness, 500 blankets.

807
01:00:02,448 --> 01:00:04,712
From Trollness, 300 overcoats.

808
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,956
From Trollness, 800 pair of shoes.

809
01:00:11,124 --> 01:00:15,060
From Trollness, 100 tons of fish.

810
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:17,228
From Trollness, milk.

811
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:18,887
From Trollness, eggs.

812
01:00:19,065 --> 01:00:20,464
From Trollness, butter.

813
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:50,121
It will be ready in a minute.

814
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:54,323
Fräulein.

815
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,766
The orders are that any person out
after curfew may be shot on sight.

816
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,000
Well then why don't you shoot me?

817
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:06,407
Why should there be hate between us?

818
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:10,275
There's such a thing as being in the war
and yet outside of it.

819
01:01:10,616 --> 01:01:12,675
We all have our own lives.

820
01:01:12,852 --> 01:01:16,652
All of us, even those who have the
strongest faith would like to stop fighting.

821
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,621
We'll fight until we push the last one of you
into the sea.

822
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:26,393
Perhaps what you say is true.

823
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:28,466
Perhaps that will be the end.

824
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:31,997
The resemblance is remarkable.

825
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:34,036
Good night, Fräulein.

826
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,619
The 59th watch.

827
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,518
I feel like shouting out across the seas
to the world.

828
01:01:53,693 --> 01:01:57,789
"Hey, world, we're waiting here
in Trollness. Don't forget us."

829
01:01:57,997 --> 01:02:00,693
Go ahead. Shout.

830
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:02,664
Maybe it'll help.

831
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:05,694
But tell them to be quick. I'm getting old.

832
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:12,142
When my father was my age,
he already had two children.

833
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:16,442
What must it be like to live in world
where there are no Nazis.

834
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:20,750
Good.

835
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:37,694
I might have been a German guard.

836
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,839
At a time like this, you've no right
to think of yourselves.

837
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,574
Poor Gerd.

838
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:48,873
She's unhappy.

839
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:52,540
I would be too if I were in love
with a German soldier.

840
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,224
- You got everything?
- Yes.

841
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:19,801
Why don't you go home?

842
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:24,079
We'll stand your watch with you.

843
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,411
It's lonely out here.

844
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:28,651
I'm sorry I was angry.

845
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:37,191
Lend me a handkerchief,
will you, Gunnar?

846
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:38,921
The glasses are dirty.

847
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:52,308
That's better.

848
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:54,608
Thank you.

849
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:21,200
They've come. They're here.

850
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:23,433
Stack them over here, men.

851
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,578
The British captain says, "Look,
there's Norway, only four miles away.

852
01:04:29,749 --> 01:04:31,410
Must be quite a place in peacetime."

853
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:33,575
"Captain," I says,
"it's quite a place now."

854
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:36,745
Karen, you should've seen that wonderful,
big fisherman of yours.

855
01:04:36,923 --> 01:04:41,189
Collar up, cap pulled over the eyes,
face streaked with salt water.

856
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,158
There he was, squinting dead ahead
through the spray.

857
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,059
The picture of a Viking.

858
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:48,063
I never heard Gunnar so talkative.

859
01:04:48,234 --> 01:04:50,259
Every time the boat rolled, he'd say:

860
01:04:50,436 --> 01:04:52,563
"We're not in your store now,
eh, Malken?"

861
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:55,468
And me so seasick,
I was afraid I wouldn't die.

862
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:59,008
Same with me. It got to the point
where I thought I could stand no more.

863
01:04:59,178 --> 01:05:01,578
And at that moment,
I heard our motor stop.

864
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:03,908
"Are you sure this is the right spot,
Gunnar?"

865
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:06,677
"Yes," says Gunnar. "I marked it yesterday
on the side of the boat."

866
01:05:08,287 --> 01:05:10,016
Did you have trouble finding the sub?

867
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:13,124
No. I had the good fortune to be looking
in the right direction.

868
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,452
I saw it all.

869
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:18,723
First, a white line of breakers
and then something like a fish in the middle.

870
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:22,231
When, all at once, she was up
not 50 yards away...

871
01:05:22,401 --> 01:05:24,596
...with sailors pouring fast
out of the hatch...

872
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,330
...training a light and a deck gun on us.

873
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,236
We heard a voice calling.
"Brogge, Gunnar. Are you there?"

874
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,707
That was Ruck.
He was the first to greet us.

875
01:05:32,878 --> 01:05:35,142
"You wanted to know
when we'd deliver the arms?

876
01:05:35,314 --> 01:05:37,646
Here's your answer.
The last night in September."

877
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:39,148
I knew he wouldn't forget us.

878
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:42,116
He didn't. "Clever woman you have
in sister Gerd," he said.

879
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:43,619
"Kiss her for me, will you?

880
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:45,780
And the beautiful Miss Stensgard too."

881
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:48,984
Now, to work. I want to see
what our friends sent us.

882
01:05:49,228 --> 01:05:50,490
I wrote down every box...

883
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:53,188
...as the quartermaster
was calling out their contents.

884
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,697
Read it.

885
01:05:55,301 --> 01:05:58,566
"Fifteen thousand rounds
of 50-caliber ammunition.

886
01:05:58,738 --> 01:06:01,730
One hundred hand grenades,
300 bayonets.

887
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:05,741
Three hundred rifles
and four light machine guns."

888
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:07,936
"And don't stop to count them," he said.

889
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:10,911
I don't wanna say anything.

890
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:15,213
We should be glad to get that much,
but still, it's the old story.

891
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,913
Four machine guns
against the German army.

892
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:20,183
That Osterholm,
always on the gloomy side.

893
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:22,088
Here, Karen, feel how light that is.

894
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:25,355
Does no one here remember Stoksund?

895
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:30,927
Sure. We remember Stoksund.

896
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:33,765
But in Stoksund, they were betrayed
by a quisling.

897
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:43,607
In Trollness, we, too, can be betrayed
by a quisling.

898
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,284
Speak up, Karen.

899
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,922
Tell them who might betray us
here in Trollness.

900
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,525
My brother.

901
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:15,111
- This is the tree. Mark it.
- All right, Gunnar. I won't be long.

902
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:56,586
Down.

903
01:08:01,694 --> 01:08:03,753
The flashlight, they shot it
out of my hands.

904
01:08:03,929 --> 01:08:06,193
- Where is it?
- Don't know, shouldn't have lit it.

905
01:08:06,365 --> 01:08:07,389
That's bad.

906
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,656
Hello?

907
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:36,527
You can see for yourself
what ungrateful people they are.

908
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:39,094
They speak of loyalty to their country.

909
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:40,698
And how do they prove it?

910
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,959
By provoking the Germans
into destroying it...

911
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,797
...with their plots and conspiracies.

912
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:47,598
What do you want, Uncle Kaspar?

913
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:50,634
You and I, Johann.
We're the only sane ones.

914
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:53,472
The only calm ones, the only smart ones.

915
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:55,944
We'll come out all right,
no matter who wins.

916
01:08:56,115 --> 01:09:00,279
When I came here, it was with the clear
understanding that I was to be left alone.

917
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:01,817
Well, I've left you alone.

918
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:04,353
Well, let it continue that way.

919
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:07,526
I made a mistake in Oslo. I'm not a Nazi.

920
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:09,854
It isn't a question
of being a Nazi, Johann.

921
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:12,361
It's a question
of protecting what's yours.

922
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:16,297
This cannery is mine now,
but it'll be yours someday.

923
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:19,096
Tomorrow morning,
because of this nonsense on the hill...

924
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:21,967
...Koenig is confiscating
all the fishing boats.

925
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:25,042
He's afraid the villagers
might use them to get arms.

926
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:27,042
Do you know what that means, Johann?

927
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:31,047
It means that our cannery
will have to close.

928
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:36,514
Now, wouldn't it be better
if quietly and without any fuss...

929
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:40,090
...you could find out
what they were doing on that hill?

930
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,660
It wouldn't be hard.
The villagers trust you.

931
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:47,595
You could listen, ask a few questions.

932
01:09:50,469 --> 01:09:52,903
- Well, Johann?
- No.

933
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:55,296
I won't go through it again.

934
01:09:55,474 --> 01:09:57,271
What I went through in Oslo...

935
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,673
...when all my friends found out.

936
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,474
What will you do, Johann?

937
01:10:02,648 --> 01:10:05,913
I'll go away to some other town.

938
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:09,854
All right, let's deal in facts.

939
01:10:10,022 --> 01:10:14,459
One, travel in Norway is forbidden
without a German visa.

940
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,687
Two, it will be very simple
for the people of Trollness...

941
01:10:17,863 --> 01:10:20,559
...to find out you were a traitor.

942
01:10:20,733 --> 01:10:24,601
Three, the Nazis consider you
one of them.

943
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:28,171
They don't like traitors either.
They shoot them.

944
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:37,741
See, Johann,
the facts speak for themselves.

945
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,414
Where did you get this?

946
01:10:42,588 --> 01:10:45,386
Can you fix it, Mr. Malken?
I think it can still be used.

947
01:10:45,557 --> 01:10:48,185
- Well, where did you get it?
- I found it.

948
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,453
- Up on the plateau in the woods?
- Yeah.

949
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:52,494
Why? Is it yours?

950
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:54,926
It's lucky you found it
instead of the Germans.

951
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,124
How do you mean?

952
01:10:56,302 --> 01:10:57,826
- Well, you see that hole?
- Yeah.

953
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:01,336
German bullet went right through there.
Shot it right out of a fellow's hand.

954
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:04,899
Oh, what a night.
My back's almost broken.

955
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:09,571
Hauling all those supplies
from the plateau to the big ravine.

956
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:13,115
From the plateau to the ravine.
From the plateau to the ravine.

957
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:30,561
- Well?
- A fool's errand. There's nothing.

958
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,267
I told you word for word
what Malken said.

959
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:38,876
It's not my fault.

960
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:42,070
Lucky for us, Karen warned us in time.

961
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:43,578
Her own brother.

962
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,374
Maybe it wasn't such a fool's errand.

963
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,181
Lieutenant, the following measures
are to be carried out immediately.

964
01:11:50,356 --> 01:11:51,914
Confiscate their fishing boats.

965
01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:55,288
Evict the schoolmaster
and convert his home into a blockhouse.

966
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,986
All restrictions on our troops
are to be lifted.

967
01:11:58,163 --> 01:12:01,860
- They're free to do as they choose.
- There'll be trouble, Herr Hauptmann.

968
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:04,867
That's exactly what I want.

969
01:12:06,538 --> 01:12:08,096
Your son, Anna. He's a traitor.

970
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:10,173
- Father.
- It's time for her to know.

971
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:11,400
Know what, Martin?

972
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,512
He's a traitor. Ask him why.
Maybe he'll tell you.

973
01:12:18,784 --> 01:12:21,776
Johann, you tell them the truth now.
It'll be better.

974
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:24,218
You tell them the truth.

975
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:26,881
All right.

976
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:30,693
When the Nazis came into Oslo...

977
01:12:31,063 --> 01:12:33,657
...I had to make a decision
and I thought...

978
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:37,700
- You thought of yourself before Norway.
- Yes.

979
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,703
That was in Oslo, but here,
on the boat, you gave your word.

980
01:12:40,873 --> 01:12:43,842
I didn't realize, father, that once you're in
you can't get out.

981
01:12:44,009 --> 01:12:45,340
You can.

982
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:46,842
If you're not afraid to die.

983
01:12:47,012 --> 01:12:48,479
Karen...

984
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,583
...if I could get out of Norway
to Sweden, England, any place.

985
01:12:52,751 --> 01:12:54,946
You can help me get out.
You people have ways.

986
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,452
I know you've smuggled thousands
across the border.

987
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,750
Not long ago, in Trondheim...

988
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:02,325
...they helped a quisling
to get across the border.

989
01:13:02,494 --> 01:13:05,554
No sooner was he across, the people
who'd helped him were arrested.

990
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:08,928
Ten men were shot.
The rest sent to a concentration camp.

991
01:13:09,101 --> 01:13:12,161
No. No, I wouldn't do that.
You know I wouldn't.

992
01:13:12,337 --> 01:13:13,804
Karen, tell him I wouldn't.

993
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:16,307
You wouldn't want to do it, Johann.

994
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,035
You didn't want to go back
to the Nazis either...

995
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:20,974
...but you can't help yourself now.

996
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,876
- You're weak, Johann.
- Karen.

997
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:26,350
Mother, I wish I could speak for him.

998
01:13:26,518 --> 01:13:28,952
I wish I could say to Gunnar,
"Help my brother."

999
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:32,352
I wish I hadn't been the one
that had to warn them against him.

1000
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:36,388
Father, they'll kill me.

1001
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,659
No.

1002
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:43,630
No, we won't kill you.

1003
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:45,929
It isn't necessary to kill you.

1004
01:13:46,105 --> 01:13:51,042
There isn't a single person in this town
who doesn't know that you're a quisling.

1005
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,701
Soon all Norway will know it.

1006
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,107
JOHANN
What can I do?

1007
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,277
Mother...

1008
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:04,518
...what can I do?

1009
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:08,290
Oh, my boy.

1010
01:14:12,731 --> 01:14:14,631
I don't know.

1011
01:14:33,318 --> 01:14:35,912
<i>"In the name of the German army
high command, I decree...</i>

1012
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:38,147
<i>...the immediate confiscation
of all vessels.</i>

1013
01:14:38,323 --> 01:14:40,086
<i>It is forbidden to leave the harbor.</i>

1014
01:14:40,259 --> 01:14:43,126
<i>It is forbidden to remove
any equipment from these boats.</i>

1015
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:46,787
<i>Any resistance will be crushed
by military force."</i>

1016
01:15:22,034 --> 01:15:23,626
Come in.

1017
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,204
- Yes?
- Good morning.

1018
01:15:32,244 --> 01:15:33,871
Good morning.

1019
01:15:38,217 --> 01:15:40,981
My name is Sixtus Andresen.

1020
01:15:41,153 --> 01:15:45,556
I'm the schoolmaster of Trollness,
retired seven years.

1021
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:48,249
Your men came to see me this morning.

1022
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:52,693
They were kind enough
to offer me 48 hours to move my things.

1023
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:55,059
What little odds and ends I have,
my books...

1024
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:56,667
Yes?

1025
01:15:59,838 --> 01:16:01,203
Hm.

1026
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,903
Do you mind?

1027
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:09,873
What with the scarcity these days,
it's been some time since I've smoked.

1028
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,113
What do you want?

1029
01:16:15,554 --> 01:16:17,215
Thank you.

1030
01:16:19,191 --> 01:16:21,352
I thought it only right...

1031
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:25,553
...considering that you are
de facto commandant of the village...

1032
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:28,256
...to acquaint you with a decision
that I've made.

1033
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,691
I'm very busy.

1034
01:16:29,868 --> 01:16:34,635
I know. I hope you will forgive me.
I know I'm being selfish, but, uh...

1035
01:16:35,574 --> 01:16:37,508
Why did you want my house?

1036
01:16:37,876 --> 01:16:39,844
For a blockhouse.

1037
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,003
But what was it you wanted
to see me about?

1038
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:45,614
I cannot let you have my house.

1039
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:50,216
- You what?
- I must forbid you to enter my house.

1040
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,555
Are you insane? I could have you shot.

1041
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,553
I know.

1042
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,359
But if you're interested, I'll tell you
what brought me to my conclusion...

1043
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:06,026
...which is, I can assure you,
completely unshakable.

1044
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,229
You see, I'm well past 70.

1045
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:13,367
And at my age, it would be foolish for me
to be like Socrates' enemies...

1046
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:17,106
...and fear death more than I love truth.

1047
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:22,379
- Go on.
- I have no guns, no airplanes, no force.

1048
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:24,579
- I disdain...
- Silence!

1049
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,186
What you don't understand
is that the individual man...

1050
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:30,794
Quiet, you fool!

1051
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:34,955
The individual man must stand against you
like a rock.

1052
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:37,397
Will you stop?

1053
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,127
No.

1054
01:17:39,371 --> 01:17:43,865
If I were afraid, there might be hope
for you, but I'm not.

1055
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:49,569
There are certain things
you cannot take away from me.

1056
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,512
What is mine is mine.

1057
01:17:52,684 --> 01:17:57,587
Do you think you can stop
the working of my brain and my heart?

1058
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:01,187
We are not animals, we are men.

1059
01:18:02,561 --> 01:18:06,258
That is the foundation of law.
You cannot win.

1060
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:10,367
Where are your courts,
your judges and your juries?

1061
01:18:10,535 --> 01:18:13,993
Until you bring them forward,
I must forbid you my house.

1062
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:15,833
He forbids!

1063
01:18:16,007 --> 01:18:17,599
He forbids!

1064
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,917
Attention!

1065
01:18:34,092 --> 01:18:35,787
Attention!

1066
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,393
I give you 45 minutes
to clear everything out of his house.

1067
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:47,299
Clear him out too.
We have no room for philosophers.

1068
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:49,667
Take all his belongings
to the public square...

1069
01:18:49,841 --> 01:18:51,866
...and burn them as a lesson
to the others.

1070
01:18:52,043 --> 01:18:55,410
They must be taught to obey.
That's an order.

1071
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:00,783
Stack arms.

1072
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:04,052
Throw the old goat to us.
We'll catch him.

1073
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:27,037
Well, my little goat almost got away.
You better throw me a rope.

1074
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:30,477
So you like to run, Grandfather. Go on.

1075
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:41,450
Come on.

1076
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:48,088
After you've been here for a while,
you'll get used to it.

1077
01:20:00,745 --> 01:20:03,043
Hail! Halt!

1078
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,512
One!

1079
01:20:04,683 --> 01:20:06,275
Two!

1080
01:20:27,839 --> 01:20:31,798
The professor has so much in his head
that he doesn't need his books anymore.

1081
01:20:31,977 --> 01:20:35,105
He asked us to distribute
a little knowledge among all of you.

1082
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,510
Here's some knowledge for you,
my friends.

1083
01:20:37,682 --> 01:20:39,513
There's some knowledge.

1084
01:20:39,684 --> 01:20:41,652
Knowledge for you.
Here's some knowledge.

1085
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,344
Here.

1086
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,650
Do nothing. This is not the day.

1087
01:22:26,825 --> 01:22:28,690
Wait for the day.
- Do nothing. Wait.

1088
01:22:29,094 --> 01:22:30,721
Wait for the day.

1089
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:32,362
Wait.

1090
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:37,233
Wait. Wait. Remember Stoksund.

1091
01:22:40,472 --> 01:22:42,303
Wait. Our day is coming. Wait.

1092
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:48,768
This is not the day. Wait. Wait.
Remember Stoksund.

1093
01:22:49,147 --> 01:22:50,614
Wait. Wait.
Wait now.

1094
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:54,710
Remember Stoksund. Wait.
Our day will come.

1095
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,320
This is not the day. Wait. Wait.

1096
01:25:22,433 --> 01:25:24,458
All right, Brogge.

1097
01:25:39,184 --> 01:25:42,642
You must forgive us, Sixtus Andresen,
for not helping you.

1098
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:45,346
But, you see, if we had
then all our hopes...

1099
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:47,889
I understand.

1100
01:25:48,426 --> 01:25:50,519
Is this why you came to see me?

1101
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,289
- To explain?
- Yes.

1102
01:25:53,464 --> 01:25:55,261
And the others?

1103
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:57,697
They've asked me to speak for them.

1104
01:25:59,204 --> 01:26:02,002
I'm a fool, Brogge.

1105
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:06,509
We all think
that you're a very brave man.

1106
01:26:06,678 --> 01:26:09,112
Still a fool.

1107
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:15,116
Koenig is a fool too, but I, a worse one.

1108
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:19,315
Thank you for coming.

1109
01:26:30,702 --> 01:26:33,694
Each day we learn a lesson.

1110
01:26:35,073 --> 01:26:38,702
What is the lesson for today, Stensgard?

1111
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:44,105
The individual cannot stand like a rock.

1112
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:48,282
Even a rock can be crushed.

1113
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,111
It's obvious.

1114
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:54,921
Tell me, Stensgard.

1115
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:00,090
Do you think that again I prove a point?

1116
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:21,916
Another patrol. Every day. Every day.

1117
01:27:25,089 --> 01:27:27,114
The days to come will be even worse.

1118
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:30,557
Koenig wants to make us lose our heads.
He's trying to forced our hand.

1119
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:31,888
He will, Gunnar.

1120
01:27:32,063 --> 01:27:34,122
Our people won't stand it much longer.

1121
01:27:34,299 --> 01:27:36,494
Soon, we'll have to fight.

1122
01:27:37,568 --> 01:27:40,401
There are some of us
who won't come out of it alive.

1123
01:27:41,539 --> 01:27:44,099
Every battle must have its dead.

1124
01:27:45,643 --> 01:27:46,974
We've been lucky, Karen.

1125
01:27:47,145 --> 01:27:49,670
We've had two whole years together.

1126
01:27:50,214 --> 01:27:52,876
Time is measured differently these days.

1127
01:27:53,051 --> 01:27:55,178
A day is a year.

1128
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,348
In a way, this war's been good to me.

1129
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,821
Because of it, I met you.

1130
01:28:01,926 --> 01:28:05,555
We must be ready for whatever happens.
The plans have got to be well laid.

1131
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:08,198
Tonight we'll meet in Osterholm's cellar.

1132
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:12,299
I'll go back and tell those inside.
Notify the others, I'll meet you at my house.

1133
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:15,303
No. I'd better go home.
It's a lonely house now.

1134
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:18,533
All right, I'll pick you up there.

1135
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:51,268
Will you shut that off?

1136
01:28:51,442 --> 01:28:54,138
When the English gave us this,
they told us to use it.

1137
01:28:54,312 --> 01:28:56,439
Well, why do you have to use it here?

1138
01:28:56,614 --> 01:29:00,482
If the Germans caught me,
I'd be dead even if I had nine lives.

1139
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:03,711
A meeting in my cellar,
guns in my cellar...

1140
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:06,755
...and now an illegal radio in my ce...
Will you shut that off?

1141
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:09,188
Mr. Churchill's going to speak.

1142
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,352
For a week, you've been saying,
"Mr. Churchill's going to speak."

1143
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:14,464
So far, all I've heard is static.

1144
01:29:14,632 --> 01:29:17,465
All the same,
Mr. Churchill is going to speak.

1145
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:21,037
Good evening, Hulda.

1146
01:29:21,205 --> 01:29:23,935
Is...? Oh, good evening, Mrs. Stensgard.

1147
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,132
- Doctor.
- Good evening.

1148
01:29:25,309 --> 01:29:27,072
- I came for Karen.
- Karen's not here.

1149
01:29:27,245 --> 01:29:28,872
Oh, please come in. You're welcome.

1150
01:29:29,047 --> 01:29:32,244
We were about to have some tea.
We could sit and talk a while. Hulda?

1151
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:35,079
No, thank you, Mrs. Stensgard.
I haven't got much time.

1152
01:29:35,253 --> 01:29:37,687
I left Karen an hour ago.
She was gonna meet me here.

1153
01:29:37,855 --> 01:29:41,018
- We were going on together to Osterholm's.
- An hour ago?

1154
01:29:41,259 --> 01:29:43,250
- Perhaps, we'd better go and find out.
- No.

1155
01:29:43,428 --> 01:29:47,387
She's probably stopped some place to visit,
perhaps with Gerd, and went on with her.

1156
01:29:47,565 --> 01:29:50,796
We're holding a meeting, doctor,
in Osterholm's cellar.

1157
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:53,402
We'd like you there to help us plan.

1158
01:29:54,705 --> 01:29:56,434
- Me?
- Yes.

1159
01:29:56,607 --> 01:29:58,632
I'll wait for you if you like.

1160
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,613
Oh, no, no. No, you go ahead.
You go on.

1161
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,608
All right, you know where we are
if you change your mind.

1162
01:30:05,783 --> 01:30:08,479
Good evening.
Good evening, Mrs. Stensgard.

1163
01:30:18,849 --> 01:30:21,317
Martin, you go.

1164
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:24,613
Go on with him.
Your heart's with them. I know it is.

1165
01:30:24,788 --> 01:30:28,485
I knew it this afternoon
when you stood in the square and you sang.

1166
01:30:28,659 --> 01:30:31,822
And I knew it here all evening
when you were silent.

1167
01:30:31,995 --> 01:30:35,624
I knew what was on your mind,
what was in your tongue.

1168
01:30:36,566 --> 01:30:40,730
Martin, I want you to go with him.

1169
01:30:51,081 --> 01:30:54,107
Now, there's your hat, the cane.

1170
01:30:54,284 --> 01:30:57,310
Doctor should always look his best.

1171
01:31:06,129 --> 01:31:08,359
I'll go and look for Gunnar.

1172
01:31:09,433 --> 01:31:13,267
That's all we need, somebody to go out
to look for someone else.

1173
01:31:13,437 --> 01:31:15,166
You shouldn't have let Gunnar go out.

1174
01:31:15,339 --> 01:31:19,400
- He was here. He should have stayed here.
- Then why didn't you try to stop him?

1175
01:31:26,683 --> 01:31:29,743
I think they're here.
- Now will you turn that off?

1176
01:31:31,054 --> 01:31:32,316
Dr. Stensgard.

1177
01:31:38,595 --> 01:31:41,359
I brought my wife.
I hope you don't mind.

1178
01:31:41,531 --> 01:31:43,590
You're both welcome.

1179
01:31:45,836 --> 01:31:49,067
- Dr. Stensgard, this is your chair.
- Thank you.

1180
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,237
Mrs. Stensgard, will you sit here?

1181
01:31:52,409 --> 01:31:54,673
- You were expecting him to come?
Why, yes.

1182
01:31:54,845 --> 01:31:57,006
Oh, thank you.

1183
01:31:58,215 --> 01:32:01,412
But my daughter and Gunnar Brogge,
they were supposed to be here.

1184
01:32:01,585 --> 01:32:05,419
Yes, we're expecting them.
They're a little late.

1185
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:16,356
- It's raining.
- Yes.

1186
01:32:18,668 --> 01:32:21,466
Oh, that's a pretty shawl you've got on.
Did you make that?

1187
01:32:22,005 --> 01:32:23,029
Yes.

1188
01:32:23,774 --> 01:32:27,870
Don't you think it'd be a good idea
for you to turn the radio on?

1189
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:32,010
But you said...

1190
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:38,911
Mr. Churchill's going to speak.

1191
01:32:44,594 --> 01:32:46,494
- She's not here.
Gunnar.

1192
01:32:46,663 --> 01:32:48,927
I've looked everywhere,
every house, every street.

1193
01:32:49,099 --> 01:32:51,897
When you came to my house, you told me
she'd gone with Gerd. I remember clearly.

1194
01:33:00,811 --> 01:33:04,076
Karen, what is it?

1195
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:07,850
Karen, what is it?

1196
01:33:08,585 --> 01:33:11,053
- Perhaps you all better go, leave us alone...
- No.

1197
01:33:11,221 --> 01:33:14,520
Let them hear. Let them all hear.

1198
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,231
I know the man.

1199
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:26,726
I know him.

1200
01:33:26,903 --> 01:33:31,237
Gunnar, if you think that now
is the time to fight, we fight.

1201
01:33:49,226 --> 01:33:51,091
- Listen to me.
- I'll listen to no one.

1202
01:33:51,261 --> 01:33:55,197
You're going to throw away everything we
hoped for, struggled for, to be revenged.

1203
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:58,027
Gunnar, all over Europe
this happens to many. They go on.

1204
01:33:58,201 --> 01:34:00,328
Happened to you's all I know.
All I wanna know.

1205
01:34:00,504 --> 01:34:02,938
I didn't have to tell you,
could've kept it from you.

1206
01:34:03,106 --> 01:34:05,199
They killed Gerd's father,
Solveig's husband.

1207
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:07,343
- Why am I any different to them?
- Why am I?

1208
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:11,140
I'm human. Is there a man in Norway
who wouldn't kill for this?

1209
01:34:12,282 --> 01:34:14,978
Yes, there is such a man. Gunnar Brogge.

1210
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:16,584
Gunner Brogge is our leader.

1211
01:34:16,753 --> 01:34:18,550
The people of Trollness trust him.

1212
01:34:18,722 --> 01:34:21,657
There's a chance for them to win
if he doesn't throw it away.

1213
01:34:21,825 --> 01:34:26,091
He said himself, "In these times,
we must be like steel." Like steel.

1214
01:34:26,263 --> 01:34:27,753
Were they just words, Gunnar?

1215
01:34:58,395 --> 01:35:00,056
It's...

1216
01:35:00,397 --> 01:35:03,628
It's hard to find words
for such a thing as this.

1217
01:35:04,534 --> 01:35:08,300
When you put flame to the tip of a harpoon
to temper it...

1218
01:35:08,838 --> 01:35:12,501
...even the hardest steel melts
if the flame is too hot.

1219
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:15,439
I was full of such a flame.

1220
01:35:17,914 --> 01:35:19,609
Karen is right.

1221
01:35:19,849 --> 01:35:20,975
We'll not fight now.

1222
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:23,478
These things are not forgotten.

1223
01:35:23,653 --> 01:35:25,382
They're written down in books.

1224
01:35:25,555 --> 01:35:30,822
In days to come, people will say,
"There were giants here in Trollness."

1225
01:35:32,762 --> 01:35:35,094
We came here tonight
to learn our plan of battle.

1226
01:35:35,265 --> 01:35:37,859
What is it, Gunnar? You're our leader.

1227
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:41,099
From now on,
every one of us must be a leader.

1228
01:35:42,706 --> 01:35:44,606
I'll draw you the plan here.

1229
01:35:44,774 --> 01:35:46,366
Remember it.

1230
01:35:46,676 --> 01:35:48,701
Remember it well.

1231
01:35:52,282 --> 01:35:55,877
<i>That is symbolism and that is the message...</i>

1232
01:35:56,052 --> 01:35:57,451
<i>...of the Atlantic meeting.</i>

1233
01:35:57,621 --> 01:36:00,715
<i>Do not despair, brave Norwegians.</i>

1234
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:02,915
<i>Your land shall be cleansed...</i>

1235
01:36:03,093 --> 01:36:05,118
<i>...not only from the invader...</i>

1236
01:36:05,295 --> 01:36:10,255
<i>...but from the filthy quislings
who are his tools.</i>

1237
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:11,932
<i>Yield not an inch...</i>

1238
01:37:01,785 --> 01:37:04,845
A German soldier
has been brutally assassinated...

1239
01:37:05,021 --> 01:37:07,489
...when in foreign land,
surrounded by enemies...

1240
01:37:07,657 --> 01:37:10,421
...by a civilian population of thieves
and assassins.

1241
01:37:10,593 --> 01:37:12,891
But the fatherland stands with us.

1242
01:37:13,063 --> 01:37:16,829
I want you to remember the honor
of the Third Reich lies in your hands.

1243
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,833
No man shall die unavenged.

1244
01:37:20,103 --> 01:37:22,628
There stands the self-confessed assassin.

1245
01:37:23,073 --> 01:37:26,440
The depraved product
of a degenerate democracy.

1246
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:30,238
That a man like that
could have such a son.

1247
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:33,806
But the life of one Norwegian
is not payment enough...

1248
01:37:33,983 --> 01:37:36,178
...for the life of a German soldier.

1249
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:38,616
As an example to the rest
of the population...

1250
01:37:38,788 --> 01:37:40,847
...every one of their leaders
will be shot...

1251
01:37:41,024 --> 01:37:43,618
...tomorrow morning at 7:00
in the public square.

1252
01:37:43,793 --> 01:37:47,126
Their bodies will be buried there,
graves will serve as a reminder...

1253
01:37:47,297 --> 01:37:50,528
...to slave populations
that there must be complete submission...

1254
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,793
...to the master race.

1255
01:37:52,969 --> 01:37:54,869
They will dig their own graves.

1256
01:38:09,452 --> 01:38:11,215
Three minutes.

1257
01:39:17,987 --> 01:39:21,753
- Forgive me.
- There's nothing to forgive, Father.

1258
01:39:21,925 --> 01:39:24,155
When I saw their faces, I had to kill.
I had to.

1259
01:39:24,327 --> 01:39:26,522
If it hadn't been you,
somebody else would have.

1260
01:39:26,696 --> 01:39:29,859
The noose was drawn too tight
around our necks.

1261
01:39:39,809 --> 01:39:43,438
You will see, Torgersen, from now on
this will be a peaceful village.

1262
01:39:43,613 --> 01:39:44,705
I hope so.

1263
01:39:45,081 --> 01:39:46,446
Oh, God.

1264
01:39:46,616 --> 01:39:48,584
If this suffering must be...

1265
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:52,687
...bless those that serve thee
and want only freedom.

1266
01:39:53,323 --> 01:39:56,053
But whatsoever thou decidest...

1267
01:39:57,026 --> 01:39:58,391
...may thy will be done.

1268
01:40:00,697 --> 01:40:04,189
Well, Mr. Torgersen, I think it is time.

1269
01:40:04,367 --> 01:40:06,801
Lieutenant, proceed.

1270
01:40:11,207 --> 01:40:13,607
Lay down your shovels.

1271
01:40:21,951 --> 01:40:24,351
Lieutenant, cover each entrance.

1272
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:28,149
If they don't stop when ordered, fire.
The execution will proceed.

1273
01:40:32,061 --> 01:40:34,495
This time
Koenig's guns won't stop them.

1274
01:40:34,664 --> 01:40:37,428
This time none of them are afraid to die.

1275
01:40:53,416 --> 01:40:56,977
Get the prisoners ready. Out!

1276
01:41:03,993 --> 01:41:05,551
Attention!

1277
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:08,094
Go back,
your leaders have betrayed you.

1278
01:41:08,264 --> 01:41:09,697
They deserve to be shot.

1279
01:41:10,099 --> 01:41:12,829
Go back. I will intercede in your behalf.

1280
01:41:13,002 --> 01:41:15,698
The canneries will be reopened.
Fishing will be resumed.

1281
01:41:15,872 --> 01:41:18,773
Your boats will be given back to you.
There'll be peace again.

1282
01:41:18,942 --> 01:41:23,072
Work again, bread again. Go back!

1283
01:41:32,388 --> 01:41:34,015
Ready!

1284
01:42:33,549 --> 01:42:35,608
It's an armed revolt.

1285
01:42:37,453 --> 01:42:39,444
- Headquarters, headquarters.
Yes, sir?

1286
01:42:39,622 --> 01:42:43,854
Lieutenant, revolt. It's come. They have
arms. Dispatch reinforcements to all posts.

1287
01:42:44,027 --> 01:42:46,757
Hold force to protect hotel
in case they break through.

1288
01:43:08,117 --> 01:43:11,484
Women and children should stay
under cover until they get to the boats.

1289
01:43:11,654 --> 01:43:15,590
The order was women with children
get under cover. I fight.

1290
01:43:15,758 --> 01:43:17,783
Excuse me.

1291
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:21,093
Harbor detachment, harbor detachment.

1292
01:43:21,264 --> 01:43:23,789
<i>This is Hauptmann Koenig.
Revolt. They've got arms.</i>

1293
01:43:23,966 --> 01:43:26,298
<i>They will break through to the boats.</i>

1294
01:43:53,129 --> 01:43:54,596
Dead!

1295
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,745
Go back to your room.

1296
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,689
Blockhouse.

1297
01:44:31,868 --> 01:44:33,096
<i>Blockhouse? Blockhouse?</i>

1298
01:44:33,269 --> 01:44:35,203
<i>This is Hauptmann Koenig.</i>

1299
01:44:35,371 --> 01:44:37,305
<i>Blockhouse? Blockhouse?</i>

1300
01:44:37,473 --> 01:44:39,771
Blockhouse, blockhouse,
will you answer. Corporal!

1301
01:44:41,444 --> 01:44:42,877
Your corporal is dead.

1302
01:44:43,045 --> 01:44:45,570
We're coming up to get you next.
Free Norway!

1303
01:44:52,522 --> 01:44:54,752
Harbor detachment? Harbor detachment?

1304
01:44:55,892 --> 01:44:59,123
<i>Harbor detachment? Harbor detachment?</i>

1305
01:44:59,295 --> 01:45:02,423
Yes, this is the harbor detachment.
The Norwegian harbor detachment.

1306
01:45:02,598 --> 01:45:05,396
If you want a ride to England
with women and children, come.

1307
01:45:05,568 --> 01:45:07,559
We're saving a place for you.

1308
01:45:08,571 --> 01:45:10,835
Machine guns in woods east
and west of the hotel.

1309
01:45:11,007 --> 01:45:14,067
Rabble advances across the clearing,
wipe them out with crossfire.

1310
01:45:14,243 --> 01:45:15,369
Yes, sir.

1311
01:45:23,386 --> 01:45:25,320
- Is this is what you wanted?
Thank you.

1312
01:45:25,488 --> 01:45:27,149
Here's the rest of your instruments.

1313
01:45:28,858 --> 01:45:31,691
Martin? Martin?

1314
01:45:32,428 --> 01:45:34,020
Martin!

1315
01:45:36,999 --> 01:45:39,263
Martin, goodbye.

1316
01:45:42,838 --> 01:45:44,305
Goodbye.

1317
01:46:00,723 --> 01:46:02,247
The machine guns are placed, sir.

1318
01:46:02,425 --> 01:46:04,416
The enemy is heading this way.
Many of them.

1319
01:46:04,594 --> 01:46:06,824
Radio to Trondheim.
Tell them I want planes.

1320
01:46:16,672 --> 01:46:20,267
It means our radio is dead.
They'll never get beyond the clearing.

1321
01:46:20,443 --> 01:46:22,638
Machine guns on the flanks
will cut them down.

1322
01:46:22,812 --> 01:46:25,610
You don't know, didn't see them.
They kept coming and coming.

1323
01:46:25,781 --> 01:46:27,715
Check the east wing.

1324
01:46:30,886 --> 01:46:32,148
Attention!

1325
01:46:35,891 --> 01:46:38,416
Our outposts have been wiped out.

1326
01:46:38,594 --> 01:46:40,357
The radio is dead.

1327
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:42,759
We are cut off from the outside.

1328
01:46:42,932 --> 01:46:45,264
If we succeed in holding this hotel
until 4:00...

1329
01:46:45,434 --> 01:46:47,868
...until the patrol plane
flies over Trollness...

1330
01:46:48,037 --> 01:46:50,403
...we'll be able to communicate
with the outside.

1331
01:46:50,573 --> 01:46:52,871
We'll get reinforcements.

1332
01:46:55,244 --> 01:46:57,678
We are German soldiers.

1333
01:46:57,847 --> 01:47:00,247
Soldiers of our führer.

1334
01:47:00,449 --> 01:47:02,349
These are rabble.

1335
01:47:02,518 --> 01:47:04,486
They must not win.

1336
01:47:04,654 --> 01:47:07,020
They cannot win.

1337
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:09,449
- Heil, Hitler.
Heil, Hitler.

1338
01:47:11,927 --> 01:47:14,054
Leave me alone.

1339
01:47:15,598 --> 01:47:18,158
I want to make a speech
to the German army.

1340
01:47:18,334 --> 01:47:19,995
I have ordered you to your room.

1341
01:47:20,536 --> 01:47:22,902
To the invincible German army.

1342
01:47:23,072 --> 01:47:24,699
To the master race.

1343
01:47:24,874 --> 01:47:27,342
To the conquerors of the world.

1344
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:30,809
To Hauptmann Koenig,
the father of the Koenig plan.

1345
01:47:32,848 --> 01:47:35,146
You are frightened.

1346
01:47:36,819 --> 01:47:39,754
You, remove the body,
then report down here.

1347
01:47:39,922 --> 01:47:41,219
You'll take care of wounded.

1348
01:47:57,773 --> 01:48:00,207
Now, remember,
as soon as you get out of the woods...

1349
01:48:00,376 --> 01:48:02,435
...spread out so you won't make
good targets.

1350
01:48:02,611 --> 01:48:04,238
Walk slowly.

1351
01:48:04,413 --> 01:48:07,348
Don't fire until they do, then charge.

1352
01:48:07,516 --> 01:48:09,814
We'll keep our surprises for them
until later.

1353
01:48:09,985 --> 01:48:14,615
We've gotta get this over with before
their 4:00 patrol plane checks the town.

1354
01:48:49,091 --> 01:48:50,888
Goodbye, Gunnar.

1355
01:48:51,627 --> 01:48:54,323
We've said goodbye before,
we're still alive.

1356
01:48:54,497 --> 01:48:58,331
Just in case when this is over one of us
is not around, the other gets to England.

1357
01:48:58,501 --> 01:49:00,992
Only women, children, and wounded
will get to England.

1358
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:03,604
Your plan
was for the rest of us to follow them.

1359
01:49:03,773 --> 01:49:05,536
No, we stay here.

1360
01:49:05,708 --> 01:49:08,836
These fascists will never drive Norwegians
out of Norway.

1361
01:49:09,011 --> 01:49:11,980
Those of us who come out of this alive
will take to the hills.

1362
01:49:12,148 --> 01:49:15,117
Fight on from there
until we drive them out.

1363
01:49:33,702 --> 01:49:35,329
Corporal.

1364
01:49:36,672 --> 01:49:38,264
Hold your fire until I ordered it.

1365
01:49:38,441 --> 01:49:42,639
The crossfire from the machine guns
I've placed on our flanks must not fail.

1366
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:16,235
Pick up their guns.
We need all they've got and more.

1367
01:50:20,382 --> 01:50:22,213
Why aren't they firing? Where are they?

1368
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:30,752
Norwegians!

1369
01:50:31,494 --> 01:50:33,155
Go back!

1370
01:50:33,329 --> 01:50:34,796
It's a trap!

1371
01:50:34,964 --> 01:50:37,125
They've got machine guns
on both sides of you.

1372
01:50:37,299 --> 01:50:39,290
Gunnar, it's Johann.

1373
01:50:39,468 --> 01:50:41,936
JOHANN
Go back! Go back!

1374
01:50:42,471 --> 01:50:44,939
How can we trust him? Keep going.

1375
01:50:45,474 --> 01:50:47,567
Keep going.
Keep going.

1376
01:50:48,244 --> 01:50:50,109
It's a trap!

1377
01:50:59,121 --> 01:51:02,113
Go back! Believe me, I'm with you!

1378
01:51:02,758 --> 01:51:05,318
With you, believe me!

1379
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:11,757
Osterholm.

1380
01:51:14,203 --> 01:51:17,468
Take some men, cover the woods
on the right. Lars, you cover the left.

1381
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:20,302
Got to get behind the machine guns.
Do you understand?

1382
01:51:20,476 --> 01:51:23,741
The rest of us will charge
just as soon as we hear your fire.

1383
01:55:04,266 --> 01:55:05,528
Now I can talk.

1384
01:55:05,701 --> 01:55:08,101
You're dealing here with giants!
I tell you, giants!

1385
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:11,239
Stop me from saying it now. Stop me.

1386
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,912
"Go to hotel," she said.

1387
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:27,214
"Start shooting," she said.

1388
01:56:34,556 --> 01:56:39,220
"We entered the town
of Trollness on October 28th, 1942.

1389
01:56:39,394 --> 01:56:45,424
Thorough investigation disclosed the fact
that no one was left alive on either side.

1390
01:56:45,601 --> 01:56:49,935
The former German garrison,
commanded by Hauptmann Koenig...

1391
01:56:50,105 --> 01:56:55,338
...evidently fought a battle of annihilation
with the people of Trollness."

1392
01:57:11,126 --> 01:57:12,787
Add this:

1393
01:57:12,961 --> 01:57:17,227
Hauptmann Koenig died a hero's death.

1394
01:57:17,566 --> 01:57:20,296
For the führer and the Reich.

1395
01:57:20,702 --> 01:57:25,696
The town of Trollness is once again
flying the German flag.

1396
01:57:44,293 --> 01:57:45,317
See anything?

1397
01:57:45,494 --> 01:57:48,691
One of their soldiers
is sending up the German flag.

1398
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:23,625
It's all right, I can walk alone.

1399
01:58:24,299 --> 01:58:26,631
No, you don't have to.

1400
01:58:30,272 --> 01:58:36,768
<i>If there is anyone who still
wonders why this war is being fought...</i>

1401
01:58:36,945 --> 01:58:39,937
<i>...let him look to Norway.</i>

1402
01:58:40,349 --> 01:58:46,584
<i>If there is anyone who has any delusions
that this war could have been averted...</i>

1403
01:58:46,755 --> 01:58:49,553
<i>...let him look to Norway.</i>

1404
01:58:49,925 --> 01:58:55,522
<i>And if there is anyone who doubts
of the democratic will to win...</i>

1405
01:58:55,697 --> 01:59:01,135
<i>...again I say, let him look to Norway.</i>
