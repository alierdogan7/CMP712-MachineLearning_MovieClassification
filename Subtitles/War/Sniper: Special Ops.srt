REPORTER: ...turmoil since
the Arab uprisings of 2011...

00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,620
As armored military vehicles
took to the streets of Kabul

3
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,189
in an effort to calm...

4
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,158
Even though the Middle East
is fractured by...

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,995
Burning U.S. flags continues
as unrest in Afghanistan...

6
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:08,200
And the other part is
under full Israeli control.

7
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,540
Beeline,
this is Apache Renegade,

8
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,509
nearing extraction point 3.0.

9
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,010
How copy?

10
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,279
Apache Renegade,
this is Beeline. All copy.

11
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,217
APACHE: Beeline, Team Dogbite
is on the ground.

12
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,920
Repeat, Team Dogbite is on
the ground, outside Matubahk.

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,456
Returning to outpost Renegade.

14
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,992
BEELINE: Copy that, Apache.
Good luck.

15
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,112
Now?

16
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,982
Nope.

17
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,318
Not now.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,220
Roger that.

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,942
I'll be damned.

20
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,481
You see that?

Now?

24
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:23,935
Nope.

25
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,171
Not now.

27
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,525
Now. All clear.

28
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,460
Moving.

29
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,301
This was Johnny Longbow's.

30
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,639
A rabbit's foot?

31
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,140
Can't hurt.

32
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,276
No, thanks.
I'm trying to quit.

33
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,050
We're at Zulu, up high.

34
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,018
You got a visual?

35
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,555
Roger. Moving to Bravo.

36
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,922

[Crunch]

38
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,803
Overwatch, confirm clear.

39
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,971
We're ready to check Bravo.

40
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,441
We're good here.

41

[Hinge squeaks]

42
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,218
Bravo is clear bottom.
Heading topside.

43
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,270
Overwatch, Two is at Charlie.

44
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,440
Anything in my area?

45
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,677
That's a negative.
Quiet as a mouse.

46
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,251
Hey, Vic.

47
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,088
Yeah, Jake.

48
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,925
I've been thinking about
that 50 bucks I owe you.

49
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,992
Hey, don't even.

50
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,027
And it's 60 bucks.

51
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,564
How about if we
knock off five dollars

52
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:17,234
for every time
I save your ass today?

53
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,438
Tell you what.
How 'bout we double-down

54
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,475
if I get your butt
out of here in one piece?

55
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,943
No deal.

56
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:30,515
Where does an entire personal
security detail disappear to?

57
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,384
That's the same thing
I was thinking, man.

58
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,419
I really don't know.

59
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,589
Your guess is as good as mine.

60
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,457
Just keep your eyes open,
head on a swivel.

61
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,693
Copy all.
Two holding at Charlie.

62
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,267
Bravo is clear
above and below.

63
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,403
We got a butt-load
of mix-caliber brass,

64
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,039
some blood trails,
nothing else.

65
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,667
- All right?
- Yeah.

[Hinge creaks]

67
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,586
They're done.
No package.

68
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,863
Beeline, Beeline,
this is Dogbite.

69
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,297
How copy? Over.

70
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,800
Dogbite, Beeline.
Solid copy. Send it.

71
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,804
Beeline, Beeline,
Dogbite is at Delta.

72
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,674
I say again,
Dogbite is at Delta.

73
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,777
We have the personal
security detail all down hard.

74
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,612
No joy on the package.

75
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,447
I say again,
no joy on the package.

76
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,349
Last chance is Echo.

77
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,918
Oscar Mike there now.

78
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,386
How copy?

79
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,521
Dogbite, copy all.
Standing by.

80
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,836
Hey.

81
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,147
Vasquez.

82
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,152
Doc, eyes.

83
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,234
Hey, you think they're
waiting for us inside?

84
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,070
No. They're gonna hit us
on the way out.

85
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,772
Doc.

86
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,350
Clear!

87
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,590
Clear!

88
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,527
Clear.

89
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,829
- Positive ID?
- Yep, that's the congressman.

90
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,531
Help me cut him down.

91
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,167
Cut him.

92
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,402
Got it.

93
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,171
Bring him down.
I got him.

94
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,873
Yep, he's mine.

95
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,544
Congressman?
Congressman!

96
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,745
Sir!

97
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,215
All right, they got him
narc'd with something.

98
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,284
I'm gonna hit him with some
Narcan to bring him out of it,

99
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,819
then we gotta get
out of here ASAP.

100
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,756
Beeline, Beeline, be advised,
we have the package.

101
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,225
I say again,
we have the package.

102
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,794
[Gasps]

103
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,329
Sir, sir, sir, stay calm.
Look at me, look at me.

104
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,264
- No!
- Hey, look at me, okay?

105
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,300
We're here to help you, okay?

106
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,570
Beat up, but still breathing.

107
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,539
We will be moving to
Foxtrot 3 for exfil.

108
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,009
Seven pax.
And we need a doc on the bird.

109
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,476
How copy? Over.

110
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,579
Dogbite, Beeline. Copy all.

111
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,915
No birds available
at this time.

112
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,717
Exfil will be ground.

113
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:28,619
Meet the vics at Foxtrot 3.
They are rolling now.

114
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,887
Beeline, that is
a piss-poor option.

115
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,522
I say again,
piss-poor option.

116
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,726
We have a priority package.
Can we get a bird?

117
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,695
Negative, Dogbite.
No air authorized on this one.

118
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,599
ETA on the vics is five mikes,
call sign "Rattler."

119
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,467
Copy, Beeline.
We'll talk about this later.

120
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,737
Break, break.
Overwatch, Overwatch.

121
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:50,341
Be advised we are Oscar Mike
to Foxtrot 3 for ground exfil.

122
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,376
I say again, ground exfil.

123
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,078
Cover our move
and join the party

124
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,813
once you have eyes
on the incoming vic.

125
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,882
How copy? Over.

126
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,184
Oh, hang on.
There's dust being kicked up

127
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,054
by something on the back street
to your right as you come out.

128
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,588
Roger that.

129
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,724
We'll come out with the package
when ride is confirmed.

130
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,629
Confirmed. Humvee inbound.

131
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,132
All right, gents.
You heard him? Good?

132
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,134
Marcus, give Doc a hand.

133
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,402
Okay.

134
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,211
All right, help us out.
Get on your legs.

135
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,646
Use those legs.
There you go, buddy.

136
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,116
All right, you are glue to him.
All right.

137
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,617
Overwatch, Overwatch,

138
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,789
we are Oscar Mike with package
to Foxtrot 3 for exfil.

139
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,056
Cover our six.

140
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,225
Roger. On our way.

141
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,660
Moving. Let's go.

142
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,594
Go.

143
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,064

144
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,632
[shouting in Arabic]

145
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,307
This is your fire station.
Maintain my six.

146
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,541
Copy.

147
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,491
Oh, man, that felt like a trap
from the get-go.

148
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,559
Like we had a choice.

149
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:49,010
At least they're
not behind us.

150
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:50,111
Not yet, anyway.

151
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,552
This is as far as we can go.

152
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,600
Rattler, Rattler!

153
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,070
We're in a firefight
at position Charlie.

154
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,305
Not sure we can make it
to Foxtrot 3.

155
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:20,708
If you make it,
you come to us.

156
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,388
Doc, Miller, Marcus, move it!
Let's go!

159

- Shit!

161
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,982
Rattler! Rattler!

162
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,450
This is Dogbite!

163
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:06,420
We're still in
a heavy firefight!

164
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,324
Position Charlie!

165
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,828
Playtime is over!
Playtime is definitely over!

166
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,932
When you enter the ville,
bypass Foxtrot 3.

167
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,534
Head directly
to the city square.

168
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,668
I say again, city square.

169
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,171
We're on the southwest corner.

170
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,810
And, gents, give us as much
firepower as you got

171
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:31,746
so we can get this package
on the vic.

172
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,682
Over there!

173
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,551

Overwatch, Overwatch!

175
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,922
Join us ASAP

176
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,591
as soon as you have eyes
on the vics inbound.

177
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,829
Moving now.

178
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,078
Overwatch, watch my right!

179
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:10,117
Come on, pick it up!

180
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,185
Come on!

181
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,989
Put your hand on my shoulder
and don't let go.

182
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:23,097
Get him in there!
Get him in there!

183
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,203
- Secure the package!
- In here!

184
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,238
[Screams]

185
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,507
Come on, buddy!

186
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,775
Get him in!

187
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,346
Vic, we can't hold
this position any longer.

188
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:42,582
Don't you move!
Don't you dare move!

189
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,197
Vic, we gotta go.

190
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,099
Jake, where are you guys?
We gotta move!

191
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,307
Come on, boy, let's go.

192
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,552
Vic, the orders are clear!
You're risking everything now!

193
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,888
Shit!

194
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:28,195
Get out of here!

195
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,865
Go!

196
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,570
Come on.

197
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,617
- Do you know your name?
- Cooper.

198
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,186
Cooper? Congressman Cooper,

199
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,820
I'm Sergeant Richter
of the U.S. Army.

200
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,622
We're taking you back to base,
all right?

201
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,894
Let me have that thing.

202
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,362
Keep it up. Come here.

203
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:05,299
You're gonna be okay.
All right.

204
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,234
Where are you?
Open another field dressing.

205
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,636
Give me one more pack.
Hurry up.

206
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,841
How you doing, buddy?

207
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,510
We should go back.

208
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,380
We can't. Getting
the congressman to safety

209
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:20,915
is our number one priority.

210
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,384
I know what our number one
priority is.

211
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:24,919
Okay.

212
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,687
I'm just saying
I'd like to go back.

213
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,158
And we will, Vic,
as soon as we can.

214
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,060
Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there.

215
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:35,595
I gotta keep pressure, okay?
You all right?

216
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:36,897
Step on it, Charlie!

217
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm crushing it, Vic.

218
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,135
I'd like to be more helpful,
Miss Conrad,

219
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,404
but your timing's off.
Maybe in a couple of days.

220
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,072
I can't believe this.

221
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,376
You're deliberately
hamstringing me, Colonel. Why?

222
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,744
Nobody is
hamstringing anybody.

223
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,548
It's simply not safe
outside the wire right now.

224
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,050
That's ridiculous.
This is a war zone.

225
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,052
It's never going to be safe.

226
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,855
Look, you may have finagled your
way onto this combat outpost,

227
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,425
and you may be
Admiral Willet's niece,

228
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:25,028
but none of that buys you
a ride outside this wire.

229
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,797
It's just too damn dangerous.

230
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,566
I'll have you know
I was embedded

231
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,167
with Cheyenne at Obamadad.

232
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,769
Yeah, and three soldiers
were killed on that ride-along.

233
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,272
Ah, so you're saying I'm some
kind of jinx, is that it?

234
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,074
You're saying I got
those men killed?

235
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,442
I'm not saying anything
of the kind.

236
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,643
Here's what I am saying.

237
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,645
You are not going
outside my wire.

238
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,879
End of discussion.

239
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,317
I see. So you are
hamstringing me.

240
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,724
Let's go, men!

241
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,192
Oh, shit. What's that?

242
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,531
Move it! Move it!
Let's go!

243
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,865
Medics on the way!

244
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,167
Let's go!
Get him out, get him out!

245
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,903
Okay.

246
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,908
Hey, get the congressman down
to the colonel now, ASAP.

247
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,712
Trevor, close that gate,
damn it!

248
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,979
Secure it!

249
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,450
Medic's here, buddy.

250
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,984
No, Charlie, I can walk.

251
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,386
Don't need no medic.

252
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,187
We can get you inside,
get you all patched up.

253
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,057
No, I can walk.
Let me walk. Vic!

254
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,859
I'm sorry, buddy.
It has to be this way.

255
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,993
Get him on the stretcher now!

256
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,663
- You! Get over here!
- Hey!

257
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,332
Come on.
One, two, three.

258
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,833
[Grunts]

259
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,806
- Charlie, you got him?
- I got him. Grab him.

260
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,276
One, two, three, go!
Let's go, move.

261
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,584
I don't know who you are
or what you want,

262
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,018
but stay away from my men.

263
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,520
And who authorized you
to take photos?

264
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,921
Easy, cowboy.

265
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,090
Stay away from my men.
Do you understand me?

266
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,059
NATO correspondent,
so just cool down, okay?

267
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,031
Hey, you can't do that.

268
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,405
Give that back to me.
Give that--

269
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,806
- Charlie, keep her out.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,275
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

271
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,179
Excuse me, Sergeant,
is that Congressman Cooper?

272
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,847
Ma'am, please, just stand back.

273
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,015
Is that Congressman
Stan Cooper?

274
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,417
Ma'am, please step aside.

275
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,187
What is he doing in there?
Is he wounded?

276
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,188
Damn it!

277
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,382
It was just a bright flash
of light right in my eyes.

278
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,484
It must have ricocheted
off the Humvee.

279
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,119
[Groans]
My face feels like it's on fire!

280
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,522
I know, Marcus.
Let Shipley take a look.

281
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,526
[Groans]

282
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,094
Well?

283
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:15,799
I can see shapes.
It's all blurry.

284
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,401
Marcus, listen to me, buddy.

285
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,903
Stop talking and let Shipley
take care of your wounds.

286
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:24,107
Just sit back and relax, okay?
We'll be back to check on you.

287
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,743
- Let's go.
- Hey, Vic.

288
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,143
Yeah.

289
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,913
Thanks for dragging me
into that Humvee.

290
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,915
If I had just been
a little bit faster.

291
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,118
Yeah, forget it.
It's what we do, right?

292
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,888
We watch each other's six.

293
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,693
May I have a word with you?

294
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,995
V? You know what we gotta do.

295
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,765
Go get the gear prepped.
Stand by.

296
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,534
Roger that.

297
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,902
What do you want?

298
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,804
I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

299
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,472
I'd really like to fix that.

300
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,374
You know I got a job to do.
So do you.

301
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,142
Sometimes I can be
a little pushy

302
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,845
'cause I'm one of those people
no one ever wants around.

303
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,147
If I don't push, I don't get.

304
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,883
Makes me pretty unpopular.

305
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,484
So I'm sorry.

306
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,653
Fair enough.

307
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,355
Janet Conrad.

308
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,225
That Janet Conrad?

309
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,895
What's that supposed to mean?

310
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,396
I think maybe I heard of you.

311
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,298
Don't start with
this jinx nonsense.

312
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Imbedded in Portacurdey.

313
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,201
- Obamadad.
- Have a nice day.

314
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,070
Was that Congressman Cooper
you just brought in?

315
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,505
I don't know who
you're talking about.

316
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,373
Of course you do.
Congressman Stanford Cooper.

317
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,376
He's one of the most vocal
opponents of military spending.

318
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,212
He'd shut this whole operation
down if he could.

319
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,081
Cut your paycheck,
cancel your vacation,

320
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,516
shoot your dog,

321
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,318
yet here he is.

322
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Why?

323
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,856
Sure sounds like you know
a lot more than I do.

324
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:49,693
What's he doing here?
Why are you being so evasive?

325
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,162
I have a debrief to attend.

326
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:05,658
We didn't make it out, huh?

327
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,993
No.

328
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:12,599
What about the others?

329
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,401
Some did,
some are lying out there.

330
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,742
Thanks for not
leaving me behind.

331
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:24,477
Don't mention it, brother.

332
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,582
Jake?

333
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,184
Yeah.

334
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:36,790
I can't move my legs.

335
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,424
I'm trying, but...

336
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,062
I can't feel anything.

337
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,098
You got a round
lodged in your spine.

338
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,667
I stopped the bleeding, but...

339
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,836
there's really not much more
I could do for now.

340
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:54,941
We gonna have to wait
until some folks get here.

341
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:57,577
When will that be?

342
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,280
Soon, I hope, man.
Our 119 is shot.

343
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:04,617
Can't fix this damn thing.

344
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,521
Probably we're gonna have
to just wait it out.

345
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,194
And you checked the bodies?

346
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:16,562
Yes, sir. All of 'em.

347
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:19,465
Full of bullet holes.
Some of 'em cut up.

348
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:22,635
Bodies were all stripped clean
of body armor and weapons.

349
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:25,238
They had the bodies stacked up
in that little shop

350
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,607
across the street
from the hotel.

351
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,877
Looks to me like it was a real
intense, close-quarter battle.

352
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,312
They lost.

353
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:33,680
Then we headed
over to the hotel.

354
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,415
They had the congressman
strung up there

355
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,518
like a damn worm on a hook,
and we took the bait.

356
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,053
Then what?

357
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,621
Request to speak freely.

358
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,190
Shoot.

359
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:47,360
How in the hell does
a non-military observer

360
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,095
like the congressman

361
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:54,600
get authorization to go on some
sightseeing tour in Matubahk

362
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,904
and then fall into a damn ambush
that is so perfectly laid out

363
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:01,141
that not one of the team members
of the personal security detail

364
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,976
survives or radios for help?

365
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,477
Don't smell right, sir.

366
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,546
I don't have a good answer
for you, Sergeant Mosby.

367
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,882
What about the congressman?
Why was he spared?

368
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,450
Who the hell knows?

369
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,185
Maybe they were
planning to stage

370
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:13,753
some Internet extravaganza
with him

371
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,421
or trade him
for something they want.

372
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,823
Hell, they only
had him for a day.

373
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,225
Maybe they didn't
have any plan at all.

374
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:20,493
Maybe.

375
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,097
All right, sir, look,
as far Chandler and Cannon go--

376
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,834
If you're talking about going
back into Matubahk today,

377
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,969
negative.

378
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,604
Why? Those are my men, sir.

379
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:35,508
Because I'm short of people
and ammunition.

380
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,410
Here's the deal, Mosby.

381
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,445
Renegade got hit hard
last night,

382
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,114
and they're still
under pressure.

383
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:44,050
All available air assets have
been committed to that fight.

384
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,486
In the meantime, I get word
a major Taliban force

385
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,355
is headed in our direction.

386
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,790
If that's the case,
I don't have the people,

387
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,426
and I don't have the ammo
to stage an effective defense.

388
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,696
So I am not authorizing
anything outside the wire

389
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,166
until we get resupplied
and reinforced.

390
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:01,534
Now go see about your men.

391
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,943
All right, when do we go?

392
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,812
- We don't.
- What?

393
00:27:12,814 --> 00:27:15,215
Colonel says we wait.

394
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,616
That doesn't make any sense.

395
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,719
I know.
He's got his reasons.

396
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,521
I'm just not sure I'm buying.

397
00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:23,423
What are you gonna do?

398
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:26,726
I'm gonna go ask
some questions.

399
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,396
You stand by.
Be ready to move.

400
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,407
Marcus.

401
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,442
You awake, buddy?

402
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,678
Hey, Vic.
Yeah, I'm awake, all right.

403
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,880
They just gave me
a shot of the good stuff,

404
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:49,749
so it won't be long.

405
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,484
That's good, buddy.
That's good.

406
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:52,986
You need your rest.

407
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:56,122
Well, I'm sorry about
Doc and the guys.

408
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:58,825
Yeah, yeah, we all are.

409
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:03,629
I guess compared to them,
I'm the lucky one.

410
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:10,370
I want you to have this.
Maybe it'll do you some good.

411
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:13,873
Besides, I heard
there's a jinx in the camp.

412
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:18,744
News travels fast, huh?

413
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:21,647
You, uh, sure
you can spare this?

414
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:22,449
[Chuckles]

415
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,750
Yeah, I'm sure.

416
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:26,987
As long as you have it on you,
you'll be okay.

417
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:28,388
All right, buddy.

418
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,457
I'll take real good care
of it, all right?

419
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:36,496
[Groaning]

420
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,505
[moans]

421
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:49,642
- Congressman?
- [Screams]

422
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,644
It's okay, it's okay.

423
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,079
You're safe, you're safe.

424
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,581
I'm Sergeant First Class Mosby.

425
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,617
I was leading the rescue team
this morning, sir.

426
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,519
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,920
Relax, relax.

428
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,289
Congressman.

429
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,690
- Sir.
- Hmm?

430
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:07,160
I need to know
what happened in Matubahk.

431
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:12,399
Sir, was it an ambush
or was it something else, sir?

432
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,467
Congressman?

433
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:16,503
You're not gonna get anything
out of him, Vic.

434
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,172
He's been on the hard stuff
for a while.

435
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,640
Ah, damn it.

436
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:25,778
Yeah. I heard him talking
before he passed out.

437
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,448
He was rambling.

438
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,651
What'd you hear him say?

439
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:36,822
He said a name
two, three times.

440
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:38,258
I don't...

441
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,929
Ab-- Abdul Abbat...

442
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:43,996
Abdul Azim Abad?

443
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,687
Sergeant.

444
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,389
How's your friend?

445
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,795
[Sighs]

446
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:18,164
Ma'am?

447
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,334
You keep doggin' me. Why?

448
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:23,803
Hey, I thought
we were friends now.

449
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:26,006
Besides, you're the most
interesting soldier I've met

450
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:27,140
so far.

451
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,776
Well, you must not be
looking too hard.

452
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,477
Let's call a truce.

453
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,847
I'm sure we can find a happy
balance, don't you think?

454
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:35,949
You haven't even
gotten to know me yet.

455
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,083
[Chuckles]

456
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,120
Oh, I think I know you
pretty well.

457
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:43,222
Let's see.

458
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:45,025
Spoiled little rich girl.

459
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:48,695
Probably went to Harvard,
Yale, Princeton.

460
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,596
Mount Saint Agnes.

461
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,799
Oh, Mount Saint Agnes. Close.

462
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,001
Uh, you got some heavy hitters
in your background.

463
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:57,403
The kind of folks
that can push along

464
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:58,772
your little career in NATO

465
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,375
to get you exactly where
you want to be fast.

466
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:05,845
I'm guessing you're probably
somebody's daughter,

467
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,080
granddaughter...

468
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,114
Niece.

469
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,448
Niece!

470
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,583
Admiral Willett's.

471
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:11,851
Oh, even better.

472
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:14,620
That's outstanding.
Admiral.

473
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,622
Well, the admiral must not
be too fond of you

474
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,124
if he sent you here.

475
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,627
You kidding me?
I begged for this assignment.

476
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,197
But your colonel
keeps smothering me.

477
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,899
Now it wouldn't do for
the lieutenant colonel

478
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,735
to allow you to get your ass
shot up on his watch.

479
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:30,269
Can you blame him?

480
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:32,271
Well, no, but I didn't fly
all the way out here

481
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:34,708
just to photograph some
soldiers washing their skivvies

482
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,509
and playing horseshoes.

483
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,744
Hmm.

484
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:41,681
I have to ride along
on a mission.

485
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:44,150
I see. I feel your pain.

486
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,120
But that is not my call.

487
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:50,824
Now, ma'am,
if you will excuse me,

488
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,659
I've got some skivvies to wash.

489
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:00,700
[Distant dog barking]

490
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,989
It's funny.

491
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:26,826
My girl back home
is always ragging on me.

492
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:32,031
Stress of all this makes her
kind of crazy, you know?

493
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:41,107
So yesterday
I get this letter from her.

494
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,577
Not a phone call,
just an old-fashioned letter.

495
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:49,615
Says she found someone new.

496
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,620
Someone who could
be there for her.

497
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:00,927
Someone who wasn't
halfway around the world.

498
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,730
Didn't think this day
could get any worse,

499
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,100
and then this happens.
[Laughs]

500
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,939
I mean,
what are the chances, right?

501
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:16,442
Listen, man, you're gonna get
a Silver Star out of this

502
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:17,944
when it's all over,

503
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:21,347
and you'll have all
the girlfriends you want.

504
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,648
Yeah, right.

505
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:30,423
Sergeant,
Jackson wants to see you.

506
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,127
- He send you to look for me?
- That's the memo.

507
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:35,628
Damn.

508
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,096
Stand by.

509
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,669
Never waste a good cigar.

510
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,911
Colonel.

511
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,281
Gents, we got an update on
what happened to our resupply.

512
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,951
This is Bashir.
He's a terp from Renegade.

513
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,220
Seems Bashir and a specialist
by the name of Tyler

514
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,288
were on one
of the supply trucks.

515
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,226
Escort hits an IED ambush
followed by a ground attack.

516
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:09,362
Bashir and Tyler take off
cross-country in the truck.

517
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,697
They reach a point
about eight clicks from here.

518
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,500
Truck breaks down.
Bashir dismounted,

519
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,870
walked the rest of the way in
to bring us the information.

520
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:19,005
What's the current status?

521
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:20,940
Well, Specialist Tyler
seems to think

522
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:23,109
that it's a relatively
minor mechanical problem,

523
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,279
something like
a broken fuel line.

524
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,748
He's standing security there,
but he can't call for help.

525
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,716
No radio in the truck.

526
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,952
Well, QRF from Renegade
should be handling that.

527
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:36,389
Yeah, and maybe they haul
his truck back to Renegade.

528
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:39,625
We need that fuel and ammo
more than they do right now.

529
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:40,960
So I want you to get out there,

530
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,796
find that truck,
help Tyler get it fixed

531
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:46,032
and roll it back here.

532
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:48,467
Take Vasquez, take Jennings.

533
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,735
Bashir will show you the way.

534
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,371
Any questions?

535
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:53,873
- I got one, sir.
- Yeah?

536
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,377
What about Abdul Azim Abad?

537
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,811
What about him?

538
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:00,613
He's on our top ten
hit list of bad guys,

539
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:03,249
and he's operating in that AO.

540
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:04,984
How do you know that?

541
00:35:04,986 --> 00:35:06,953
Folks talk in their sleep, sir.

542
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:09,555
Look, you might as well know.

543
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:13,426
When Congressman Cooper came
up here, he had an agenda.

544
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:15,361
The whole idea was to prove
that all our efforts

545
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,696
are just a big waste
of time and money.

546
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,967
He insisted on visiting an
isolated or abandoned village,

547
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:22,868
and we only had
one of those in our AO.

548
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,237
- Matubahk.
- Yeah.

549
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,605
Now you get out there
and find that truck.

550
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:27,873
Yes, sir.

551
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:30,743
Vic.

552
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:33,212
JR?

553
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,448
If you can't get
that truck rolling,

554
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,818
pull what cargo you can
and blow the rest in place.

555
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,020
We got very little time
and a lot to do.

556
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:44,324
Roger that, sir.
Let's go, guys.

557
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:59,805
Jake?

558
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,941
I'm burning up, man.

559
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,179
I know.

560
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:12,051
Listen, I gotta go.

561
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:15,288
You're not leaving me, are you?

562
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,824
No. I'm going to get
Doc's med pack and some water.

563
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:27,900
Use this. Just don't
shoot the wrong guys.

564
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,637
Roger that.

565
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,239
All right.

566
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,098
I'll just wait right here.
[Chuckles]

567
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:13,279
I haven't been out this way
in almost a year.

568
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,915
Looks like a great place
for an ambush.

569
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,251
Hardly anybody
uses it anymore.

570
00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:20,319
It turns into a dirt road
just up ahead.

571
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,323
Let's just try not to hit any
IEDs while we're out here, huh?

572
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,058
Yeah, you got it.

573
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,234
- I don't like it.
- How's that?

574
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:39,372
Convoy gets hit
by a IED ambush,

575
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:43,075
and the one vehicle
that has all the munitions

576
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,810
and supplies that we need

577
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:47,079
goes all Evel Knievel
and escapes,

578
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,315
but breaks down
before it can get to us.

579
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,358
You think maybe
this is a setup?

580
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,794
I don't know, V.

581
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,996
Maybe.

582
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,969
Hey, look.

583
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:16,742
I don't see our boy Tyler yet,
so don't get too close.

584
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:18,077
Go ahead, stop.

585
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,137
Bashir.

586
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,506
You know Specialist Tyler,
right?

587
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,208
Yes, Sergeant.

588
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,044
Go ahead and walk on out there
and call his name.

589
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:53,879
Excuse me?

590
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:56,849
About halfway
between here and there.

591
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,384
We'll cover you.

592
00:38:58,386 --> 00:38:59,918
As you wish.

593
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,120
Go on.

594
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,931
Be ready, boys.

595
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,948
He seems awfully jumpy.

596
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,151
I might be too.

597
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:35,021
Yeah. Point taken.

598
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,409
Mr. Tyler?

599
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:02,381
- [Camera clicking]
- Huh?

600
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:06,519
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

601
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,287
This is perfect.

602
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,056
Get back in the truck.

603
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:13,325
This is what I came here for.
Don't you try to stop me now.

604
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,762
I'll wring your scrawny
little neck.

605
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,165
Sounds like fun, but I don't
think my uncle would like it.

606
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,466
Stay behind me.

607
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:23,702
Mr. Tyler, are you still here?

608
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:26,238
MAN: Freeze right where you are!

609
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:31,009
Hands behind your head!

610
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:35,414
It's me, Bashir.
I brought help.

611
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:40,052
Hey, Bashir, buddy.

612
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:43,855
I didn't know who it was
at first. Sorry, man.

613
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:46,325
I was kind of a sitting duck
out here right now, you know?

614
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:49,228
I understand completely.

615
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,729
All right,
let's get on with this.

616
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,969
Brother, am I glad
to see you boys.

617
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,738
Need a hand, Specialist Tyler?

618
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,107
Need a fuel line.

619
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:02,608
What makes you think
it's a fuel line?

620
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,876
Well, I'm out of gas,
and I shouldn't be.

621
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,979
Might be a hole in the tank,
but I didn't see one.

622
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:08,614
She turns over okay?

623
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:10,849
Yeah. No, everything's in
perfect working order, except...

624
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:12,585
- You're out of gas.
- Right.

625
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:15,521
I got more gas than I need in
the back of the truck, but...

626
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:18,190
not gonna do anyone
any good there.

627
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,726
All right. Let's go
take a look, Jennings.

628
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,698
Do you mind?

629
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:32,371
Could you guys shake hands
again? One more time.

630
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,375
Oh, that's so good.

631
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,045
All right, Jennings,
get us out of here ASAP.

632
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:41,614
I'll figure it out.

633
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:50,255
[Speaking Arabic]

634
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,091
Oh, dear God.

635
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,760
Just about to tell you
about her.

636
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,563
[Baby crying]

637
00:41:58,565 --> 00:42:00,198
Yeah, that too.

638
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,668
[Crying continues]

639
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,837
Specialist Tyler...

640
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,439
could I have a word
with you in private?

641
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,909
Absolutely.

642
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:13,112
[Crying continues]

643
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:55,554
All right, Specialist,
lay it on me.

644
00:42:55,556 --> 00:43:01,026
Well, I lost my escort
around 0400 hours.

645
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:03,228
I was lucky to have gotten
around the lead vehicle,

646
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,697
so I went off-road.

647
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:07,199
Figure that's where I
picked up the damage.

648
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:09,334
Radio took a hit.

649
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,536
About an hour after sunup,

650
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:13,739
she comes running out
in the middle of the road.

651
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:15,007
I almost ran her over.

652
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,377
She, uh, hit the ground
pretty hard, so I stopped.

653
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:21,113
She was a wreck, Sergeant.

654
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:23,315
She was crying,
begging for help.

655
00:43:23,317 --> 00:43:25,150
Bashir said she wasn't
making any sense,

656
00:43:25,152 --> 00:43:28,420
and that's when we discovered
she had that baby hidden there.

657
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:30,222
Anybody chasing her?

658
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,790
No, I mean,
not that we could see.

659
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,491
I don't even know
where she came from.

660
00:43:33,493 --> 00:43:36,328
There's not a lot
back in these hills.

661
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,763
That's all?

662
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,765
That's it.

663
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:42,434
I mean, you know,
without a radio in the truck,

664
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,069
I didn't know what to do.

665
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:45,570
And with the baby and all,

666
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:49,374
I just put her out of sight
in the back.

667
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,945
We continued on to Wildside,
then this happened.

668
00:43:52,947 --> 00:43:54,847
Hmm.

669
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:58,050
That's one hell of a story,
Specialist.

670
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,684
It's all true.

671
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:18,336
It's just a camera.
We won't hurt you. That's it.

672
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:19,772
Tell her.

673
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,879

[baby coos]

677
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:37,589
Well?

678
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,557
It's very hard to interpret.

679
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,994
She speaks one of
the minor languages.

680
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,896
Sansi, I think.

681
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:45,931
Very hard to make out.

682
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,666
Great.

683
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:51,870
Well, she knows
we'll help her,

684
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:55,640
or she wouldn't have flagged
Specialist Tyler down.

685
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,810
Conrad, go back
to the other vehicle

686
00:44:57,812 --> 00:44:59,912
and go get her
some food and water.

687
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:00,879
What?

688
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,314
You found your way
on this mission.

689
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:03,515
Now you're part of it.

690
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:05,784
Now move your ass.
Let's go.

691
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:13,058
- Sergeant Jennings?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,426
Your nickname is Detroit

693
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:15,527
because you're good
with cars, right?

694
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:16,895
That's the rumor.

695
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:18,630
Get your butt under
this Deuce-and-a-half,

696
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,732
find the problem so we can
get the hell out of here.

697
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:24,269
- I'm on it.
- I'll help you.

698
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:29,541
Bashir?

699
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:32,477
Why didn't you
tell us about her?

700
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,880
Sergeant, there are
many like her.

701
00:45:34,882 --> 00:45:37,549
I didn't think it was
of any real importance.

702
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:41,019
All I could think of
was helping Mr. Tyler.

703
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:42,888
Now, is there anything else

704
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,523
that you have failed
to mention to me?

705
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,260
No, sir.
I am very sorry.

[Whistles]

707
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:54,900
Wow. There's enough gas and ammo
in here to blow us all to hell.

708
00:45:56,636 --> 00:45:59,738
Or start a small war.

709
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:12,284
- Is something wrong?
- I can't find the MREs.

710
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:28,500
Thanks.

711
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,573
That was some crazy stunt
you pulled, Miss Conrad.

712
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,542
Why would you do
a thing like that?

713
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,677
Pearls don't lie on
the seashore, Detroit.

714
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,381
If you want one,
you gotta dive for it.

715
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,616
This one?

716
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:46,718
Yeah, that's it.

717
00:46:47,988 --> 00:46:49,988
Hey.

718
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,258
I feel kind of naked out here.

719
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,726
You mind sharing?

720
00:46:55,996 --> 00:47:00,432
I shouldn't,
but under the circumstances,

721
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:02,700
here.

722
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,072
[Sighs]
Thanks.

723
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:15,581
How's it going?

724
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,516
Nothing yet.

725
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:27,826
You give 'em to her.
You're less threatening.

726
00:47:31,532 --> 00:47:33,632
Less threatening?

727
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,068
[Chuckles]

728
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,338
Yeah, you're a lot
less threatening.

729
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,208
Now put that away and don't
shoot yourself and jinx us.

730
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,944
You're getting your very own
article out of this, Sergeant.

731
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,681
I can't wait.

732
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:51,417
I happen to be
an expert marksman.

733
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,786
Can you say the same?

734
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:14,039
Jake. How'd it go?

735
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:16,408
Good for now.

736
00:48:29,857 --> 00:48:32,224
What's the short of it,
Jennings?

737
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:33,792
We got a problem.

738
00:48:33,794 --> 00:48:36,027
Not that short.
Can you fix it?

739
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,529
I think so.

740
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:40,666
I gotta swap out a section of
this line and see if it'll hold.

741
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,835
And that's it? You'll be done?

742
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,904
Maybe. I won't know until
I do it and then I test it.

743
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:47,473
ETA.

744
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:49,241
I gotta cut out
the old line first

745
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:50,776
and then I'll know more.

746
00:48:50,778 --> 00:48:53,579
Better have some
good news for us soon.

747
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:55,581
I'd hate to have to
blow this truck up.

748
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,149
I'm doing my best.

749
00:48:58,151 --> 00:48:59,485
We know, son.

750
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:01,052
Just get it done, Jennings.

751
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:02,954
We gotta get outta here.

752
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:09,862
Okay, Bashir.

753
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,030
Let's try this one more time.

754
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,198
Yes, Sergeant.

755
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,105
How's it going back here?

756
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:21,273
We're doing fine.

757
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,942
I think she trusts me.

758
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:29,615
Good, because I need you
to check her out

759
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:31,249
medically and otherwise.

760
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,619
Make sure she's okay before
we take her into Wildside.

761
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:35,521
I'll give it a shot.

762
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:37,456
I don't have
any experience at this.

763
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:40,358
You.

764
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,193
Make her understand.

765
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:44,563
I don't care if you have
to act it out or what.

766
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,097
Yes, sir.

767
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:48,166
Don't call me "sir."
I work for a goddamn living.

768
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:49,735
Get in the truck.

769
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:01,112
[Speaking Arabic]

770
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,114
[speaking Arabic]

771
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:10,522
Got it.

772
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,796
Well?

773
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:19,965
I gotta cut a piece of line,
replace this.

774
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,700
Don't look like much.

775
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:24,770
You'd be surprised how much
trouble a little part can cause.

776
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,772
Well, don't let me
stop you, Jennings.

777
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,306
Get it done.

778
00:50:28,308 --> 00:50:31,944
- I'll help you cut it.
- I got a saw on the truck.

779
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:36,515
Sergeant?

780
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:37,516
Yeah.

781
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:40,352
The lady wants you.

782
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:41,787
Okay.

783
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:53,031
Yeah, what's up?

784
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:57,202
Thought you ought to see this.
This is bad.

785
00:50:57,204 --> 00:50:58,971
Hmm. She been whipped.

786
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,740
No wonder she wanted
to get away.

787
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:03,876
Probably punishment
for something.

788
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:07,946
Any sign of infection?

789
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:10,248
Not that I could see.

790
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,183
All right.
Well, just do what you can,

791
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:16,788
then, uh, check the baby out,
make sure he's okay.

792
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,992
And you, wait here with her,
all right?

793
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,327
- Of course.
- In the truck.

794
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:35,774
How's our guest?

795
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,976
[Sighs]
Pretty rough.

796
00:51:37,978 --> 00:51:40,245
Someone whipped
the hell out of her,

797
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:44,249
but nothing a little time
won't heal, I guess.

798
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:47,886
I guess maybe Tyler did
the right thing after all.

799
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:52,424
Maybe. Maybe not.

800
00:51:52,426 --> 00:51:55,994
One thing he was right about:

801
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:58,096
We are sitting ducks out here.

802
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:00,098
- [Gunfire]
- Contact!

803
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,700
Heads up!

804
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,940
Go. Get down.

805
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:10,409
[Gunfire continues]

806
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:17,048
How many you think there are?

807
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,719
Not enough to rush us.
Not yet anyway.

808
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,801
Jennings, Tyler, sitrep!

809
00:52:35,803 --> 00:52:38,870
- A-okay!
- Good to go!

810
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,544
Conrad!

811
00:52:45,546 --> 00:52:46,912
All good.

812
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:57,422
Reload!

813
00:52:58,492 --> 00:53:00,258
Up!

814
00:53:01,495 --> 00:53:03,061
Get back here.

815
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:04,896
- Vasquez!
- Let me go!

816
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:07,165
Stay put.

817
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,072
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

818
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:16,508
You do realize we're sitting
on a powder keg here.

819
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:20,445
One wild shot hits those
explosives back there, boom!

820
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:31,556
V, I've gotta make it
to that Deuce-and-a-half.

821
00:53:31,558 --> 00:53:35,627
I'm gonna bring it back here
as a shield for this truck.

822
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,696
That's suicide, Vic.

823
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,731
Jennings!

824
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:42,834
I gotta make it to your truck
and bring it back here.

825
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:44,636
Sergeant, let me go.

826
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,739
Are you sure you can bring the
truck back alongside this truck?

827
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:50,041
I can try.

828
00:53:50,043 --> 00:53:52,010
We'll give as much
cover fire as we can.

829
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,545
- Roger that.
- Tyler!

830
00:53:53,547 --> 00:53:55,246
You got any smoke grenades
in the back?

831
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,916
- Negative, Sarge!
- All right, Jennings.

832
00:53:57,918 --> 00:53:59,317
Run like the wind, boy.
Ready?

833
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,121
- Yeah.
- Three, two, one, go!

834
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:13,532
Run, run, run!

Jennings!

837
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:28,112
- I'm moving up.
- Go, go!

838
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:39,524
[Jennings groans]

839
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,499
Get in the truck.

840
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,504
Tyler!

I need a mag!

844
00:55:42,823 --> 00:55:44,489
Heads up!

845
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,266
[Engine revs]

846
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,661
Good work, Jennings.

847
00:56:22,663 --> 00:56:24,495
All right, Conrad.

848
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:26,597
Let's get baby-mama
transferred over.

849
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:27,899
Roger that.

850
00:56:27,901 --> 00:56:29,968
What about me, Mosby?

851
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,069
You can still drive, right?

852
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:32,236
Hell yeah, I can.

853
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,238
All right.
For now, get your weapon

854
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,107
and put some cover fire
on that hillside.

855
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:37,208
Roger that.

856
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,610
Keep your head down.

857
00:56:39,612 --> 00:56:42,714
Hey, V, I need you to set
a demo charge on Tyler's truck.

858
00:56:42,716 --> 00:56:44,348
Use the remote detonators,

859
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,085
and we'll blow it when we're
on the road out of here.

You stay here.

865

I'll get up there,
and I'll pull you up.

I think it's just grazed.

to be like this?

must worry about you a lot, huh?

889
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,694
Ha. I wouldn't know.

890
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,104
Oh.

891
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,274
Sometimes it's good
not to know, I guess.

892
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,209
Works for me.

893
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:46,213
Why are you doing this for me?

894
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:51,585
I don't know, man. You kinda
remind me of my little brother.

895
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:55,923
He always tried to do his best.
I'm just doing mine.

896
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,160
He's gone now?

897
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,362
Yeah, Desert Storm.

898
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,802
I'm sorry my best
wasn't good enough.

899
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:12,339
If a man does his best,
what else is there?

900
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,147
We're all set.

901
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:22,717
This thing blows, there won't be
nothing left but the tires.

902
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,351
Good.

903
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,188
What happened here?

904
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,656
Miss Conrad there

905
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,357
decided she wanted to earn
herself a Purple Heart.

906
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,060
Didn't do this on purpose.

907
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:36,564
Let's keep that blood pressure
down until I stop this bleeding.

908
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,866
- Hey, Sergeant?
- Yeah.

909
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:41,669
Help a girl out?

910
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,739
My camera.

911
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:45,807
Sure.

912
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:56,283
Don't forget to spell my name
right in the photo credits.

913
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,753
What exactly is your name?

914
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,221
Victor.

915
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,555
Victor?

916
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:05,126
Victor Thomas Mosby.

917
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,229
I'll remember that.

918
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,668
Okay.
[Groans]

919
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:20,074
It sure got quiet
all of a sudden.

920
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,243
Yup.

921
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:25,713
Like somebody flipped a switch.

922
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:28,482
Wonder why.

923
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:31,052
You think it was
seeing Miss Conrad?

924
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,553
Nope.

925
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,489
They shot her easy enough.

926
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,893
You think it's her?

927
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,594
I do, V.

928
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,530
When they saw her,
it was all over.

929
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,234
But why?

930
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,536
I don't know.

931
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:51,405
But I'm sure she does.

932
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:01,599
[Grunts]
Grab him, Bashir.

933
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,219
Poor Mr. Tyler.

934
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:24,188
He was so very brave.

935
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:27,491
All right, Mr. Bashir.

936
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,461
Here's what's gonna happen next.

937
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:32,863
What do you mean, Sergeant?

938
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:35,600
I want to know
who that girl is.

939
01:02:38,204 --> 01:02:39,637
And I want to know now.

940
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:41,372
Sergeant, I already--

941
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:43,374
Shh shh shh shh!

942
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,414
Here's the deal.

943
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:55,286
There are dozens of languages
just floating around out here.

944
01:02:55,288 --> 01:02:57,020
Maybe she knows one of them.

945
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:03,827
And we'll never know...

946
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:05,730
unless we try.

947
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:09,867
Maybe you'll get lucky.

948
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,569
Got me?

949
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:15,172
Yes, Sergeant.

950
01:03:15,174 --> 01:03:17,742
Get to it. Go.

951
01:03:27,186 --> 01:03:30,655
[Speaking Arabic]

952
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,367
What you thinking about, Jake?

953
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:50,708
I'm thinking about
trying to get out of here.

954
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,043
Yeah, I've been thinking
the same thing.

955
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:58,849
Any ideas?

956
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:06,691
Yeah. I'm gonna go downstairs
and commandeer us a truck.

957
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:10,461
Yeah? When you gonna do that?

958
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:11,862
Right now.

959
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:19,970
[Speaking Arabic]

960
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:21,839
VIC: Conrad!

961
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:24,709
Anything?

962
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:28,813
Maybe. Been at it for a while.

963
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,417
Jennings, how's it going
under there?

964
01:04:33,419 --> 01:04:35,986
Almost there, Sergeant.

965
01:04:35,988 --> 01:04:36,954
Bashir?

966
01:04:38,524 --> 01:04:39,757
Well?

967
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:41,759
She speaks some Dani.

968
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:43,594
What'd you find out?

969
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:46,230
You'll be very surprised,
Sergeant.

970
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:47,765
Her name is Jada.

971
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:50,167
She's the daughter-in-law
of the Taliban leader

972
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:51,736
Abdul Azim Abad,

973
01:04:51,738 --> 01:04:54,104
a very powerful, very evil man.

974
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:55,939
Yeah, we know who he is.

975
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:58,909
And that is his only grandson.

976
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:01,945
Well, how about that.

977
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:03,748
You think she's
telling the truth?

978
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,717
You saw how those rebels reacted
when they got a look at her.

979
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,152
They fell back like
their asses were on fire.

980
01:05:09,154 --> 01:05:13,624
Well, I think
she's telling the truth.

981
01:05:13,626 --> 01:05:16,827
And if she is telling the truth,

982
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,463
she's worth her weight in gold.

983
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:21,064
What are you saying?

984
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:25,068
Sergeant Jennings, soon as
you get finished under there,

985
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,637
I want you in the front
of the vehicle.

986
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,272
Conrad, I want you in
the rear of the vehicle.

987
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:31,041
I want you guys to keep your
eyes open and your heads down.

988
01:05:31,043 --> 01:05:35,579
Now that they know we have her,
this isn't the end of it.

989
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:37,515
Roger that.

990
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,217
V, let's go for a walk.

991
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:47,925
[Sighs]

992
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:53,631
What's on your mind, Vic?

993
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:58,068
What's on my mind
is Cannon and Chandler.

994
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,538
They're waiting on us
back in Matubahk.

995
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,540
Oh, no.

996
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,842
Oh, yeah.
Just hear me out.

997
01:06:04,844 --> 01:06:06,243
[Sighs]

998
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:08,913
Vic, you can't be thinking
what I'm thinking.

999
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:13,884
Look, Old Abdul's
daughter-in-law there,

1000
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:17,555
she's our ticket to waltz
right back in to Matubahk,

1001
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:21,058
extract our boys
without even firing a shot.

1002
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,360
Are you serious?

1003
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:26,430
You would use that lady
and her baby as a human shield?

1004
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:27,965
Of course not.

1005
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,667
I'd just have 'em along,

1006
01:06:29,669 --> 01:06:32,470
keep things peaceful, civilized.

1007
01:06:32,472 --> 01:06:34,104
That's insane.

1008
01:06:34,106 --> 01:06:35,873
Is it?

1009
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:37,942
I got a truck
sitting right there

1010
01:06:37,944 --> 01:06:40,611
with enough firepower
to blow old Abdul and his boys

1011
01:06:40,613 --> 01:06:41,979
to kingdom come.

1012
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:45,449
Now I got two things
that he really wants.

1013
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:48,085
This will cost you big.

1014
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,420
You kidding me?

1015
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:52,756
I'm already out 60 bucks.

1016
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,196
- Beeline.
- This is COP Wildside.

1017
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:33,430
Identify yourself.

1018
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:36,834
Beeline, this is Overwatch
waiting for extraction.

1019
01:07:36,836 --> 01:07:39,636
Copy, Overwatch.
Message received.

1020
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:54,285
Colonel, this just came in.

1021
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:56,754
Well, thank Christ.

1022
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:58,822
I swear, Chandler's got
more lives than a cat.

1023
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,025
Make sure I see all
the traffic on this.

1024
01:08:01,027 --> 01:08:02,193
Yes, sir.

1025
01:08:08,101 --> 01:08:10,667
All right, everybody,
listen up.

1026
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,970
This is what's gonna happen.

1027
01:08:12,972 --> 01:08:16,107
Sergeant Jennings,
very carefully,

1028
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:19,176
is going to take everybody
back to Wildside.

1029
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,479
I'm going to take command
of Tyler's vehicle.

1030
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:23,714
Roger that.

1031
01:08:23,716 --> 01:08:25,016
As soon as you
arrive at Wildside,

1032
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,850
I want you to inform
Colonel Jackson

1033
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,585
that I elected
to take a slight detour

1034
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:32,957
and reunite this young lady
and her baby with her family,

1035
01:08:32,959 --> 01:08:36,060
and that I will be following
shortly thereafter.

1036
01:08:36,062 --> 01:08:37,795
All right,
anybody have any questions?

1037
01:08:37,797 --> 01:08:39,096
Yeah. Hell yeah.

1038
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:41,332
Sorry, Conrad,
we're out of time.

1039
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,967
Godspeed.

1040
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,001
Detroit.

1041
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,171
You're in charge now.

1042
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:50,274
Sergeant?

1043
01:08:50,276 --> 01:08:53,844
I can't leave you sitting in
the brig all by your lonesome.

1044
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:56,647
Who'd you have to boss around?

1045
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,682
Thanks.

1046
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:03,120
All right,
let's gear up and move out.

1047
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,279
Get timers and blasting caps.

1048
01:10:06,386 --> 01:10:07,885
Here.

1049
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,424
- Five minutes.
- Meet you in the square.

1050
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,031
Rich.

1051
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:56,033
Rich, wake up, man.

1052
01:10:56,035 --> 01:11:00,171
Cavalry's just arrived.
Be ready.

1053
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:10,714
Don't run out on me,
little brother.

1054
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:12,783
We're almost home, ya hear?

1055
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,083
[Beeps]

1056
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:38,102
[sighs] Well, that answers
one of my questions.

1057
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,710
And that answers the other.

1058
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,680
Halfway back up the street,
right side.

1059
01:12:49,682 --> 01:12:52,349
Rooftop, Sergeant Chandler.

1060
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:57,721
I can hardly wait to see
what happens next.

1061
01:12:57,723 --> 01:12:59,423
Let's get to it.

1062
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:24,849
Oh, look, proud grandpa.

1063
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:27,084
At least I hope he is.

1064
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:31,222
You should.
Your life depends on it.

1065
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,264
Good luck, buddy.

1066
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:44,601
Hey, who needs luck
when you've got a...

1067
01:13:44,603 --> 01:13:45,702
rabbit's foot?

1068
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:53,510
Here we go.

1069
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:26,443
How.

1070
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:30,047
Very amusing, Sergeant.

1071
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,949
Just like I figured.

1072
01:14:31,951 --> 01:14:33,918
Educated in the States.

1073
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,886
Four years Liberal Arts.

1074
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,521
Scholarship.

1075
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:39,623
You?

1076
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,892
Four years, high school.

1077
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,961
[Scoffs]

1078
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:48,432
All right, have your men
put their weapons on the ground,

1079
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:51,335
put their hands
behind their head,

1080
01:14:51,337 --> 01:14:54,104
and then we'll get this
whole matter all wrapped up,

1081
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:55,539
nobody gets hurt.

1082
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:59,310
[Laughs]

1083
01:14:59,312 --> 01:15:02,579
You truly are
a very funny man.

1084
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,714
Well...

1085
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:09,719
your daughter-in-law
sure seems to think so.

1086
01:15:09,721 --> 01:15:13,090
And what a handsome
grandson you have.

1087
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:17,261
Yup, he has your eyes,
all right.

1088
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,396
He is very dear to me.

1089
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:23,533
My only son Emir
was killed not too long ago.

1090
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:25,436
Very tragic.

1091
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:30,374
Do you think your son Amir would
approve of you whipping Jada?

1092
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:34,478
She made some bad decisions.

1093
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:59,703
Interesting.

1094
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:04,208
An animal's foot...

1095
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,876
for good fortune?

1096
01:16:05,878 --> 01:16:09,579
Well, you'd have to ask
the rabbit about that.

1097
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:18,422
Get Jada and my grandson
to me now...

1098
01:16:18,424 --> 01:16:20,557
and I'll let you go.

1099
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,764
Is that your best offer?

1100
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:32,569
Okay, then.

1101
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:34,304
Stand by.

1102
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,851
Well?

1103
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,089
- Let her go.
- What?

1104
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:55,225
Let her go.
What choice do we have?

1105
01:16:55,227 --> 01:16:56,793
[Sighs]

1106
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:24,688
- [groans]
- Rot in hell, motherfucker!

1107
01:17:45,043 --> 01:17:46,176
Get back!

1108
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:13,604
Reload!

1109
01:19:00,286 --> 01:19:02,419
Vasquez, blow it!

1110
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:07,824
Come on.

1111
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,500
VASQUEZ: Detonator fail!

1112
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:17,093
[Camera clicking]

1113
01:20:23,469 --> 01:20:26,102
You know...

1114
01:20:26,104 --> 01:20:29,105
we're gonna be in
a lot of trouble for all this.

1115
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:30,674
Probably.

1116
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,610
Most definitely.

1117
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,048
I, uh...

1118
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,818
I just want to say, uh...

1119
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:44,721
thank you.

1120
01:20:46,057 --> 01:20:47,123
And?

1121
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,125
You're not a jinx.

1122
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:52,862
Wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

1123
01:20:52,864 --> 01:20:55,532
Besides, my uncle is an admiral.

1124
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:56,933
That's right, he is.

1125
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,769
So maybe you could
put a good word in for me.

1126
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,470
I'm definitely gonna need it.

1127
01:21:00,472 --> 01:21:03,173
I could be persuaded.

1128
01:21:03,175 --> 01:21:05,442
Your exclusive story rights.

1129
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:06,943
[Chuckles]

1130
01:21:09,315 --> 01:21:12,516
All right, you win.

1131
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:13,950
What do you need from me?

1132
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,688
Well, we could start
with a big hero smile.

1133
01:21:20,526 --> 01:21:21,958
Okay.

1134
01:21:29,335 --> 01:21:30,834
All right.

1135
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,178
Okay.

1136
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:45,782
Right here.

1137
01:21:51,423 --> 01:21:53,390
Ohh.

1138
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:55,058
Man, what kept you, Vic?

1139
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,794
You still sore
about that 50 bucks?

1140
01:21:57,796 --> 01:22:00,664
Nope, and it's 60.

1141
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,833
Oh, you gonna
be like that now?

1142
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,034
And after all the times
I saved your life.

1143
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,803
All the times
you saved my life?

1144
01:22:06,805 --> 01:22:08,905
That's what people say.

1145
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:11,641
Yeah, right,
and you don't call no more.

1146
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:13,844
You know why?

1147
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,747
We done broke the comms
in all this excitement.

1148
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:21,251
Yeah, well, it was
a very long day, brother.

1149
01:22:21,253 --> 01:22:24,821
You know what?
When you get a minute someday,

1150
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:26,690
you're gonna have
to tell me about it.

1151
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:30,527
After you pay me my 60 bucks.

1152
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,362
Where's Cannon?

1153
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:35,565
He up there, yeah.

1154
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:36,966
Good to see ya.

1155
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,705
Sergeant Chandler?

1156
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,139
Yes, ma'am.

1157
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:46,810
Are you really as good
as they all say you are?

1158
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,013
Every once in a while.
