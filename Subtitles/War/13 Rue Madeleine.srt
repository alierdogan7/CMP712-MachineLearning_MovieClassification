[Man Narrating]
"What is past is prologue."

2
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:26,269
Yes, here at the National Archives
in Washington D. C...

3
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,396
past is prologue...

4
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:32,431
for this is the final resting place
of the histories and records...

5
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,071
of tens of thousands
of illustrious Americans.

6
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:39,309
World War II has come
to a victorious conclusion...

7
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:43,820
and now new names and new records
are being added to the list...

8
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,483
for the nation and the world are
for the first time learning...

9
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,959
of silent and significant deeds
performed in foreign lands...

10
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:56,933
by a legion of anonymous men and women...
the Army of Secret Intelligence.

11
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:03,039
When Washington, recovering from
the staggering blow of Pearl Harbor...

12
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,837
realized how effective had been
the long-established...

13
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,744
espionage machines
of Germany and Japan...

14
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:13,010
from the White House came orders
that the United States, too...

15
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,678
must have eyes and ears
within enemy countries.

16
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:20,850
Immediately, the nation commenced...
for the first time in its history...

17
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,588
to recruit a Secret
Intelligence Corps.

18
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:29,031
As the man best capable of organizing
the secret activities...

19
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,034
of the new United States
Intelligence Corps...

20
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:36,732
the president chose a Saint Louis
attorney, Charles Stevenson Gibson...

21
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:39,776
whose background in international
affairs had been gained...

22
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:44,439
from ten years'special service
in the American Embassy in Berlin.

23
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,449
As director of
Secret Intelligence...

24
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:51,352
Gibson reported only to the president
and theJoint Chiefs of Staff.

25
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:57,520
Among the top-level executives
of United States Secret Intelligence...

26
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:01,292
was a widely traveled scholar
and soldier of fortune...

27
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:05,597
Robert Emmet Sharkey
of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

28
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,571
Master of five languages and one
of America's foremost athletes...

29
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,134
Bob Sharkey was twice captured
by the Germans in World War I...

30
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:19,877
and both times escaped
with a brilliant record of
achievement behind enemy lines.

31
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:27,823
To Washington, in the weeks and months
that followed Pearl Harbor...

32
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:31,349
had come 76 carefully selected
groups of candidates...

33
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:36,024
for training and assignment
to secret operations overseas.

34
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,035
At the Union Station
one morning in 1944...

35
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:43,802
among thejostling thousands,
came the 77th group of candidates...

36
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:46,843
each unknown to the other.

37
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:53,543
The Washington headquarters of Secret
Intelligence was under tight security...

38
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:58,054
its address and telephone unlisted
in any governmental directory.

39
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:00,420
Few even knew of its existence.

40
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,784
The story of Operation 77
is typical of the activities...

41
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:09,424
of any of the 76 groups
which preceded it.

42
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,025
Each candidate's qualifications
and background...

43
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:16,038
had been checked and rechecked
before he was called to Washington.

44
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:21,271
Every member of O77 had volunteered
without reservation...

45
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:24,712
for hazardous duty
behind enemy lines.

46
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:29,481
Among those assigned to O77
were men like Pappy Simpson...

47
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:32,249
a British intelligence officer
in the First World War...

48
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,758
and, until early 1942,
a professor of English literature...

49
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:39,262
at Dartmouth College
at Hanover, New Hampshire.

50
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,321
Suzanne de Beaumont,
a French citizen...

51
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,859
had found herself stranded in the
United States when France fell in 1940.

52
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:52,068
Ofher husband, a captain
of artillery in the French army,
nothing had been heard.

53
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:56,306
Jeff Lassiter, son of a former
American consul at Bern, Switzerland...

54
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,814
was educated at Geneva
and Oxford.

55
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:03,876
Lassiter was recruited from the
Officers Training School at U.C.L. A...

56
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:07,754
partly because ofhis
superior knowledge of French.

57
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,805
Bill O'Connell,
a Rutgers graduate...

58
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:11,136
Bill O'Connell,
a Rutgers graduate...

59
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:15,165
had been employed in the Foreign
Department of the Chase National Bank.

60
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:18,144
He spent two years in the bank's
European branches...

61
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:20,147
then Hitler went on the march...

62
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:23,150
and O'Connell returned
to New York.

63
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:29,023
- Say, do you remember the maiden
name of your grandmother?
- Sure.

64
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,025
She was quite a dame.

65
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:33,027
I wish mine had been.

66
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:39,392
[Narrator] Far away from the eyes of
inquisitive, gossipy Washington...

67
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:43,131
in secluded, country estates
requisitioned by the government...

68
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:47,767
O77 candidates entered
phase one of training.

69
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,713
Oh, is this bunk taken?

70
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,715
- Not yet.
- You bought a roommate.

71
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,947
I don't know. A guy that can't remember
the maiden name of his grandmother...

72
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,954
- She's got one now.
- [Knocking]

- Sorry for intruding, gentlemen.

- Great. Fine.

are for your convenience.

We'll be here two weeks.
I hope you'll be comfortable.

79
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:20,166
- Are we going to start training?
- No. This is assessment school.

80
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,176
You'll be given tests
to determine your mental...

81
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,337
and physical qualifications
for training.

82
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,346
To see if we can make the grade,
is that it?

83
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:30,145
Well, everyone isn't temperamentally
equipped for every job, you know.

84
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:32,152

of beer in the icebox all the time.

Just help yourselves. Oh, uh,

This is your group, Bob.
You're in charge.

95
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:23,835
Three months of indoctrination school,
two weeks of practical exercises...

96
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,839
and they've got to be
in shape to go.

97
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,375
- Is that my assignment?
- That's one of them.

98
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,879
22 potential agents.

99
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:35,439
Most of them have a foreign background.
All can speak French.

100
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:39,044
- One of them can speak German.
- Mm-hmm.

101
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,214
You've got to find out
who that is.

102
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,281
All right.

103
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,759
That's not as easy
as it sounds.

104
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:51,424
- Why?
- Because one of the students in
that group is a German agent.

105
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,703
A German agent?

106
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:12,084
- You know?
- Yeah.

107
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,622

¶¶[Stops]

112
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:47,680
I've got a couple of things
to say to you before you begin
the next phase of your training.

113
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,350
Your instructors are all
experts in their jobs.

114
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:54,691
They're going to cram their years
of experience into your heads.

115
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:58,358
It shouldn't be necessary,
but I'm going to remind you of security.

116
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,368
Everything you learn,
everything you do, is secret.

117
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:05,236
Even your closest relatives can't know
you're an agent in O77.

118
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:08,743
Maybe nobody will ever know.
That's not important.

119
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,438
But keeping your mouth shut is.

120
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,640
Now, you're gonna have
a lot to remember...

121
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:18,845
and a couple of things
to forget.

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,254
Now, the average American is
a good sport. Plays by the rules.

123
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:28,160
But this war is no game, and no
secret agent is a hero or a good sport...

124
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:32,962
that is, no living agent.

125
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:36,697
You're going to be taught to kill,
to cheat, to rob, to lie.

126
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,366
Everything you learn is moving you
toward one objective...

127
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:44,435
just one, that's all...
the success of your mission.

128
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:48,107
Fair play? That's out.

129
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:50,617
Years of decency
and honest living?

130
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:54,382
Forget all about them,
or turn in your suits...

131
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,391
because the enemy can forget...

132
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,528
and has.

133
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:07,125

every inch of the way. All the way.

It'll break the force of your fall.

one of these launching platforms...

there's going to be an invasion.

He does know that the invasion
base is in Southampton...

and he's building up
a tremendous supply of these rockets.

When he launches his attack, it's going
to be a sustained barrage on this area.

- When Eisenhower makes his move.

00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,087
- Hello, Lassiter.
- How do you do, sir?

489
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:58,097
- Sit down, Jeff.
- Yeah.

490
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:01,700
You, uh...

491
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:05,704
- Two days ago you saw
your friend O'Connell.
- Yeah, in the canteen.

492
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:08,969
- We had a cup of coffee.
- This is not, uh, an accusation.

493
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:12,842
- You didn't reveal the nature
of your mission?
- Of course not.

494
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:17,509
- You understand why I asked.
- No, I don't understand.

495
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:21,884
Your chum O'Connell...
is an agent of the Nazi government.

496
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:24,651
- What?
- His name is Kuncel.

497
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:28,058
He's a clever, thoroughly
trained German secret agent.

498
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:30,062
Oh... Oh, you're kidding.

499
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,294
- No, I'm not kidding.
- But that's silly.
I was with him all through school.

500
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:37,303
L... I lived in the same room
with the guy for months.

501
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:41,307
Jeff, this is a tough, realistic
business with a thousand twists.

502
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,538
- Don't feel badly. He fooled me too.
- I can't believe it.

503
00:38:44,611 --> 00:38:46,545
It was hard. Harder to find him...

504
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:49,741
although I'd been told there
was a German agent in the school.

505
00:38:49,816 --> 00:38:53,718
- German agent...
- Not just a German agent.
One of the best they have.

506
00:38:53,787 --> 00:38:57,450
Planted there for a reason.
That's why he's still in the group.

507
00:38:57,524 --> 00:38:59,958
That's where you with
your disarming naiveté came in...

508
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,258
to keep him from suspecting
we knew anything about him.

509
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:07,266
- You did a very much betterjob
not knowing who he was.
- Yeah.

510
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,268
Yeah, I did a good job.

511
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:11,770
Now you got a tougher one.

512
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,471
Ajob that you can't do
without knowing.

513
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:18,477
O'Connell has been assigned
a mission in Holland.

514
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:22,481
That's the clincher
to all the misinformation
we have allowed him to obtain.

515
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:27,009
- Holland?
- The invasion of Holland.
That's the lie we're trying to sell...

516
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:29,180
to the German High Command, and Kuncel...
O'Connell... is the salesman.

517
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:31,952
- That's where you come in.
- What could I do?

518
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:36,792
- O'Connell asked for you.
We're going to send you with him.
- What about Duclois?

519
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:40,128
Still your mission as planned.
You'll proceed to Le Havre.

520
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,668
- How?
- You'll be dropped near Rotterdam.

521
00:39:42,736 --> 00:39:47,173
Contact a man
by the name Wolfert Bockman
at the Department of Public Works.

522
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:52,076
- Bockman will see that you and
Suzanne get through to France.
- S-Suzanne?

523
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:55,581
She'll be briefed for the Holland
mission with you and O'Connell.

524
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:57,583
The briefing will be short
and, of course, a phony.

525
00:39:57,651 --> 00:40:01,451
You'll be on your way
within 48 hours.

526
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:04,456
Now comes the rugged part.

527
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:09,120
- Yes.
- We think O'Connell is sold.

528
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:13,326
If we're right, he'll make his break
and you'll never see him again.

529
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,561
Could he know anything
about Duclois?

530
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,605
- Not unless he gets it from you.
- He won't.

531
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:22,233
Never forget you're dealing
with an extremely clever man.

532
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:25,938
Drop your guard one minute,
we'll have failed, you may be dead.

533
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:29,141
Don't forget the time he slugged you.
He thinks fast...

534
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:32,185
he's ruthless,
lets nothing interfere.

535
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:37,189
- That's why we're gonna do it his way.
- His way? What's that?

536
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:42,217
If he isn't sold,
and should in any way suspect
that you're on a double mission...

537
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:45,356
if he doesn't make his break
and tries to follow you...

538
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:47,366
you're going to shoot him.

539
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:51,427
- Shoot him?
- And make sure it's for keeps.

540
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:54,941
- Tha... That's rough. Tha...
- That's war.

541
00:40:57,711 --> 00:40:59,736
And that's your mission.

542
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,713
Yeah.

543
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:04,478
O'Connell can do it.
Can you?

544
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,485
Yeah, I can do it.

545
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:09,044
- That's all for now.
- Right.

546
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:13,558
- Jeff...
- Yes?

547
00:41:17,764 --> 00:41:20,198
- I know how you feel.
- Right.

548
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:32,678
- Some more?
- No, thank you. I had too much.

549
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:35,681
Isn't it the most exciting evening
in our lives?

550
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:39,981
- The room is so beautiful,
and the food was so delicious.
- Yes, indeed, yes.

551
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:44,080
- Kind of like the Last Supper.
- Not the Last Supper.
There is noJudas.

552
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:47,422
Not the Last Supper, no.
To the success of your mission...

553
00:41:47,494 --> 00:41:50,657
to your safe return, to the good things
in life for all of you.

554
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:52,699
To a better, happier world.

555
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:55,428
A message for you, sir,
and the car is ready.

556
00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:57,436
- Oh, we'll be right there.
- Thank you.

557
00:41:57,504 --> 00:42:01,065
- Luck, Jeff.
- Luck.

558
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,810
Well, let's get started.

559
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:11,613
Suzanne.

560
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:13,619
Oh, have they heard?

561
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:16,121
Yes, Suzanne, they have.

562
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:24,963
Oh.

563
00:42:27,868 --> 00:42:29,802
Pappy, I'll...

564
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:33,032
I'll be back in a minute.

565
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:35,040
Sorry.

566
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:55,118
Bad news?

567
00:42:55,195 --> 00:42:58,892
- Yes.
- Your... husband's... dead?

568
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:04,433
What a rotten break.

569
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:09,271
- Maybe it's just as well
you're not going back to France.
- [Simpson] We have to go now.

570
00:43:44,845 --> 00:43:47,279
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

571
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:50,214
- How about you fellows?
- No, thanks.

572
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:52,774
How are we doing?

573
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:56,289
Just past the coast of Holland.
Won't be long.

574
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:20,074
- Jeff?
- Yeah?

575
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:22,168
We used to talk about this one.

576
00:44:22,245 --> 00:44:26,272
- Yeah.
- Feel like you thought you would?

577
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:28,283
Yeah.

578
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:36,153
You know something?

579
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:38,160
What?

580
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:41,459
I don't believe you.

581
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:44,967
Getting close.
Check your static line.

582
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:50,772
Check?

583
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,774
Check.

584
00:44:59,749 --> 00:45:01,944
Check?

585
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:03,952
Check.

586
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:13,524
- Check?
- Check.

587
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:55,062
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

588
00:45:55,138 --> 00:45:58,301
There is. You're lookin' at me
like I was in a test tube.

589
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:03,472
- Sorry, I... guess I'm nervous.
- Yeah, I'm nervous too.

590
00:46:14,991 --> 00:46:17,687
[No Audible Dialogue]

591
00:46:22,432 --> 00:46:24,866
Comin' over the target.

592
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,977
Action stations.

593
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:47,680
Jeff...

594
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:52,421
- Yeah?
- You know that 14 million you owe me?

595
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:55,521
I'm wiping it off the books.

596
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,661
What's 14 million anyway?
Never have time to spend it.

597
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:05,605
We're even, Jeff.
We'll start from scratch.

598
00:47:05,675 --> 00:47:08,610
- You don't owe me anything.
- Running in.

599
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:15,245
One... Go!

600
00:47:19,889 --> 00:47:22,414
Two...

601
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:24,426
Go.!

602
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:31,531
Three...

603
00:47:57,193 --> 00:48:01,755
"Lassiter killed in jump. Stop.
O'Connell fired at reception
committee. Stop.

604
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:06,768
"Disappeared. Stop. O'Connell
in possession of all Henri Masson
documents. Stop.

605
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:11,773
Proceeding mission area as planned.
Stop. Suzanne."

606
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:28,051
- Which one of you girls received
this message from de Beaumont?
- I did, sir.

607
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:30,558
- You sure it's her transmission?
- Positive.

608
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,594
Killed in the jump.
What a break.

609
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,600
Yes, it is.

610
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:10,398
Well, right now we're batting
zero-zero-zero.

611
00:49:10,466 --> 00:49:12,400
- [Knocking]
- Come in.

612
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:22,305
This just came in, sir,
from the operator on the plane.

613
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:31,486
Lassiter's static cord
was deliberately cut.

614
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:35,888
- What!
- His chute never opened.
He was murdered.

615
00:49:38,094 --> 00:49:40,619
What a way to die.

616
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:42,631
What did Kuncel know?

617
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:46,226
- Could he have known anything
about Lassiter's mission?
- No.

618
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:49,601
- He knew he had Vichy credentials.
- He knew more than that.

619
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:53,073
He also knew the Holland invasion
was a phony.

620
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:57,272
Yeah. Or else he wouldn't
have killed Lassiter.

621
00:49:57,347 --> 00:50:01,943
Well, Sharkey, you've done a great job.
Where do you go now?

622
00:50:02,018 --> 00:50:05,852
- Back to Minnesota
to sit on a draft board.
- What's that?

623
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:09,858
I've made the only mistake
you're allowed to make in this outfit.

624
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:13,692
Yeah, they might send you on
a rest cure for that one, except...

625
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:15,924
There are no "excepts,"
and they're right.

626
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:19,162
- It'd look good to me.
I might do it again.
- So might I.

627
00:50:19,235 --> 00:50:21,601
The one thing we can hope
for is another chance, unless...

628
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:24,765
- Unless what?
- Unless you want to concede the victory.

629
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:30,074
- Ah, not from you, Gib.
Keep your punches up, eh?
- I said, "unless you want to."

630
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:33,809
I concede nothing... until
they throw dirt in my face.

631
00:50:33,883 --> 00:50:38,752
- That's better. Now, who have you
got to send to France?
- Only one man to send.

632
00:50:38,821 --> 00:50:41,813
Too short a time to get Duclois
and blast that target. Who?

633
00:50:41,891 --> 00:50:43,825
- Me.
- No.

634
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:47,727
An agent who wasn't familiar
with the mission wouldn't have a chance.

635
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:52,063
We haven't time to bring one up to date.
We need the time on the other end.

636
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:53,957
- You know I can't send you.
- Why not? I'm familiar
with every detail. I planned it.

637
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:56,721
- You know I can't send you.
- Why not? I'm familiar
with every detail. I planned it.

638
00:50:56,793 --> 00:50:58,727
I could leave immediately.
Give me one reason.

639
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:02,458
- You know the date and place
of the invasion.
- I've forgotten.

640
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:07,469
- Do you realize what would happen
to you if you were captured?
- Torture? Certainly.

641
00:51:07,537 --> 00:51:11,667
Every agent carries an L-tablet.
And dead one minute after you bite one.

642
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:14,904
- And Kuncel's probably waiting for you.
- I'd like that.

643
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:18,778
- We're 100% failure
unless we get Duclois.
- Right.

644
00:51:18,848 --> 00:51:22,284
There's a man loose who knows
every one of our 15 agents.

645
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:26,288
- We took that chance
when we left Kuncel in.
- I trained that group.

646
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:30,019
Every one of their lives is in
jeopardy while Kuncel's around.

647

981
01:27:23,959 --> 01:27:28,658
Now, how far is it exactly
from the river to the depot?

982
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:31,063
From the river to the depot...

983
01:27:31,133 --> 01:27:34,591
12 kilomtres point 27.

984
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,366
- Have you got all those details?
- [All Murmuring] Yes.

985
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:39,464
That's all we shall need from him.

986
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:43,637
- The French Intelligence
are not through with him.
- Take him along.

987
01:27:47,049 --> 01:27:49,745
Will you come along too, Gallimard?

988
01:27:49,818 --> 01:27:53,015
We know where the depot is,
every detail of its construction...

989
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,648
the size of the stuff
we shall need to wipe it out.

990
01:27:55,724 --> 01:28:00,058
You can be very proud
of your organization, Gibson. I want
to thank you for your cooperation.

991
01:28:00,129 --> 01:28:02,859
- Right.
- Now it's our job.

992
01:28:02,931 --> 01:28:05,092
- Good night.
- Good night.

993
01:28:06,902 --> 01:28:10,838
- Communications just sent word.
They've contacted Suzanne.
- I'll go right up.

994
01:28:23,118 --> 01:28:25,518
From de Beaumont.

995
01:28:25,587 --> 01:28:29,182
[Gibson Reading]

996
01:28:29,258 --> 01:28:33,126
- It broke off there.
- Why? What's your guess?

997
01:28:33,195 --> 01:28:38,223
It was an interrupted message.
The signal stopped, but
I could still hear the carrier.

998
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,268
He wasn't lucky.

999
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:45,339
No, he's still alive.

1000
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:47,341
That's all.

1001
01:29:03,258 --> 01:29:05,658
Just three questions,
that's all, Sharkey:

1002
01:29:05,727 --> 01:29:08,025
What was your mission?

1003
01:29:08,097 --> 01:29:10,531
Where is the invasion coming?

1004
01:29:10,599 --> 01:29:12,533
When?

1005
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:18,469
We'll make you tell,
you know that, Sharkey.

1006
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:21,941
A man can take so much punishment,
remember? You taught me.

1007
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,808
"Fair play, years of decency,
that's out."

1008
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,372
You've done your job.
Now I'll do mine.

1009
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:31,385
Where, Sharkey?
Where are they comin' in?

1010
01:29:36,425 --> 01:29:39,360
- Have you got a map?
- Right here.

1011
01:29:46,335 --> 01:29:48,565
Where?

1012
01:29:48,637 --> 01:29:51,197
Right...

1013
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:11,967
Take a good look at this house.

1014
01:30:12,038 --> 01:30:14,097
This is your target.

1015
01:30:14,173 --> 01:30:16,505
Familiarize yourself with it:

1016
01:30:16,575 --> 01:30:18,668
The house, the grounds...

1017
01:30:18,744 --> 01:30:21,713
the ornate fence,
the street.

1018
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:23,806
It's got some good landmarks too:

1019
01:30:23,883 --> 01:30:27,148
The chimney, the bay,
the surrounding hills...

1020
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:29,813
this large building
on the right.

1021
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:34,325
Take a good look at it
and remember.

1022
01:30:43,536 --> 01:30:46,437
This has got to be a job
of total destruction.

1023
01:30:46,505 --> 01:30:49,133
Not a wall left standing.

1024
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:53,668
No one must escape in
that house alive. No one.

1025
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:58,016
The nature of your mission
is unusual...

1026
01:30:58,084 --> 01:31:02,748
but I cannot emphasize too strongly
how very important.

1027
01:31:02,822 --> 01:31:06,349
Two squadrons dropping
high explosives...

1028
01:31:06,425 --> 01:31:09,258
followed by two squadrons
at minimum interval...

1029
01:31:09,328 --> 01:31:12,161
to smother the entire target area...

1030
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:15,792
with rockets and machine gun fire.

1031
01:31:15,868 --> 01:31:17,802
You know it must be important.

1032
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:22,170
You've been given
your route of approach.

1033
01:31:22,241 --> 01:31:25,438
Time over target, 0300.

1034
01:31:27,546 --> 01:31:30,674
Bombers will go in at zero feet.

1035
01:31:30,749 --> 01:31:33,616
- [Men Gasp, Chattering]
- I know.

1036
01:31:33,686 --> 01:31:36,280
I know, it's tough.

1037
01:31:36,355 --> 01:31:38,289
Any questions?

1038
01:31:38,357 --> 01:31:41,292
Well, Colonel, I think on a mission...
well, a mission like this...

1039
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,954
we'd kind of like to know
who's in that house...

1040
01:31:44,029 --> 01:31:46,657
whether it's Fatso Goering
or Hitler or who?

1041
01:31:46,732 --> 01:31:50,099
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to answer that.

1042
01:31:55,207 --> 01:31:57,334
I know this is a tough assignment.

1043
01:31:57,409 --> 01:32:00,708
You'll be risking your lives.
You have a right to know.

1044
01:32:00,779 --> 01:32:05,182
That house is the headquarters
of the German gestapo in Le Havre.

1045
01:32:05,251 --> 01:32:08,186
That's an important reason
for destroying it.

1046
01:32:08,254 --> 01:32:11,052
But it's not the only reason.

1047
01:32:11,123 --> 01:32:13,489
There's an American agent
in that house.

1048
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:16,954
And ifhe talks,
it may cost the lives...

1049
01:32:17,029 --> 01:32:19,964
of a great many American soldiers.

1050
01:32:20,032 --> 01:32:24,662
Right now he's suffering the cruelest
tortures the Germans can devise.

1051
01:32:24,737 --> 01:32:27,604
But he won't talk...

1052
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:30,471
not as long as he can stand
that punishment.

1053
01:32:32,244 --> 01:32:35,645
And no human body
can stand it too long.

1054
01:32:35,714 --> 01:32:39,650
Not even this wonderful,
tough guy from Minnesota.

1055
01:32:42,421 --> 01:32:44,719
As soon as you can.

1056
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:48,552
All right, men,
let's synchronize our watches.

1057
01:32:55,968 --> 01:32:58,562
[Whip Snapping]

1058
01:33:12,985 --> 01:33:15,249
[Snapping Continues]

1059
01:33:28,133 --> 01:33:31,068
[Snapping Stops]

1060
01:33:39,144 --> 01:33:41,738
[Snapping Resumes]

1061
01:34:01,233 --> 01:34:04,100
- What have you found out?
- Nothing.

1062
01:34:04,169 --> 01:34:07,104
[Air Raid Sirens Wailing]

1063
01:34:17,483 --> 01:34:19,417
[Softly]
They're over the target.

1064
01:34:19,485 --> 01:34:23,319
- [Bombs Exploding]
- The lamp!

1065
01:34:23,389 --> 01:34:26,324
[Plane Engines Droning]

1066
01:34:38,404 --> 01:34:40,338
[Bombs Continue Exploding]

1067
01:34:41,607 --> 01:34:44,667
[Chuckling]

1068
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:54,181
Mission completed.
