How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

Don't talk about Gracchus.
He's so hateful.

349
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,953
For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician
class is a profession...

350
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,111
and not such a bad one, either.

351
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:01,319
How else can one become master
of the mob and first senator of Rome?

Ladies! Since when are they a vice?

689
01:14:41,721 --> 01:14:45,111
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

690
01:14:45,201 --> 01:14:47,396
I hope I pronounced that word.

691
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:50,757
It's well-known that even your groom
and butler are women.

692
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:52,638
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

693
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:56,475
<i>I keep these women out</i>

694
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:59,758
That morality, which has made
Rome strong enough to steal...

695
01:14:59,841 --> 01:15:01,957
two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners...

696
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:04,874

of Roman marriage and family.

<i>I will not take a marriage vow:::</i>

699
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:13,997

prevent me from keeping.

You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

701
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,512
Exactly.

702
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:23,674
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

703
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,873

I find it difficult to hate...

707
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:39,558

- <i>Who</i>'<i>s that?</i>
- Crassus.

709
01:15:41,721 --> 01:15:45,396
- You've grown very ambitious
in your hatred.
- <i>Do you blame me?</i>

710
01:15:45,481 --> 01:15:47,995
There I was, better than
a millionaire in the morning...

711
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:50,072
and a penniless refugee
by nightfall...

712
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:52,470
with nothing but rags
and my flesh.

713
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:55,359
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua...

714
01:15:55,441 --> 01:15:58,751
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs!

715
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:02,834
These two daughters of Venus
had to taunt the gladiators...

716
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:05,879
force them to fight to the death,
and before I knew what had happened...

717

- <i>revolution on my hands!</i>
- What...

718
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,191
revenge have you in mind?

719
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:14,830
I sold Crassus
this woman, Varinia.

720
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:18,596
- Whom?
- <i>Varinia: May the gods give her wings:</i>

721
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:21,559
There was no contract,
but she was clearly his slave...

722
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:23,757
as soon as the deal was made.

723
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:27,800
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

724
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:30,395
<i>And Crassus,</i>
<i>no mention of money!</i>

725
01:16:30,481 --> 01:16:33,393
You never offered me
this woman. Why not?

726
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:36,200
Well... she's not
remotely your type, Gracchus.

727
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:39,318
- She is very thin and--
- Look around you.

728
01:16:39,401 --> 01:16:43,838

- Well, yes.

735
01:17:05,641 --> 01:17:07,677
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

737
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:23,952
That will do.

No, master.

No, master.

746
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,912
Yes, master.

No, master.

751
01:18:07,361 --> 01:18:10,398
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

752
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:13,757
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

753
01:18:13,841 --> 01:18:15,991
No, master.

754
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:17,878
Of course not.

755
01:18:20,161 --> 01:18:23,471
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

756
01:18:23,561 --> 01:18:25,995
Yes, master.

757
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,118
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

758
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:32,716
and therefore not a question
of morals, is it?

759
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:36,152
Hmm?

There's only one way to deal

1033
01:41:49,161 --> 01:41:51,311
Of course you have.

1034
01:41:51,401 --> 01:41:53,232
Why--

1035
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:55,710
What are you going to do to me?

1036
01:41:55,801 --> 01:41:57,678
I don't know.

1037
01:41:57,761 --> 01:41:59,956
What should we do with him?

1038
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,760
Let's have a matched pair,
him and me.

1039
01:42:04,401 --> 01:42:07,677
I'll not fight like a gladiator!

<i>[ Booing</i> ]

1041
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:14,515
You keep staring at this.

1042
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:17,673
Do you recognize this baton?

1043
01:42:17,761 --> 01:42:19,831
- Yes!
- You should!

1044
01:42:19,921 --> 01:42:22,719
It was in your tent.

1045
01:42:22,801 --> 01:42:25,520
The symbol of the senate.

1046
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:28,069
All the power of Rome!

1047
01:42:30,481 --> 01:42:32,949
That's the power of Rome!

1048
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:37,117
Take that back to your senate.

1049
01:42:37,201 --> 01:42:39,192
Tell them you
and that broken stick...

1050
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:41,590
is all that's left
of the garrison of Rome!

1051
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:44,115
Tell them we want
nothing from Rome...

1052
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:46,761
nothing... except our freedom!

1053
01:42:46,841 --> 01:42:49,594
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

1054
01:42:49,681 --> 01:42:51,797
We're marching south to the sea.

1055
01:42:51,881 --> 01:42:54,349
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

1056
01:42:54,441 --> 01:42:56,318
Put him on a horse!
