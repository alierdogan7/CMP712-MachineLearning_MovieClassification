I need to talk with you.

194
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,799
It's very important, I wouldn't come
here like this, if it wasn't.

195
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,599
The morning of the day the group left,..

196
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,299
Michael Burnet notified me...

197
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,099
that they were traveling from this location.

198
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,899
What happened?

199
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,499
No one knows exactly.

200
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,899
They were supposed to return 10 days ago,
but they never came back.

201
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,999
I requested help from the embassy,
but they can't help.

202
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,683
Not in Burma and not in time.

203
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:09,699
How do you know they're alive?.

204
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,234
Because we've been in contact
with the Karen freedom fighters,

205
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:16,699
who say, they think they know
where they were taken.

206
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,800
And I was given the name of an ex-military
American local from the embassy...

207
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,334
who put me in touch with men who say
they have experience in this part of the world.

208
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:26,599

209
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,399
Yeah.

210

We need you to take these men...

212
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:38,199

220
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,199
Or, kill for yourself?

221
