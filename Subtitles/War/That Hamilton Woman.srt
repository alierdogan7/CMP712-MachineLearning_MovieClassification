1
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,628
? Mon ami Pierrot

2
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,424
? Prête-moi ta plume

3
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,550
? Pour écrire un mot

4
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:22,681
? Ma chandelle est morte

5
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,809
? Je n'ai plus de feu

6
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,937
? Ouvre-moi ta porte

7
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,066
? Pour l'amour de Dieu

8
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,194
? Ma chandelle est morte

9
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:33,322
? Je n'ai plus de feu

10
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,450
? Ouvre-moi ta porte

11
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:37,579
? Pour l'amour de Dieu

12
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:46,127
? Au jardin de mon pére
les lauriers sont fleuris

13
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,391
? Au jardin de mon pére
les lauriers sont fleuris

14
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,733
- Bonsoir, monsieur.
- Bonsoir, madame.

15
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,650
Combien coûte le cidre là-bas?

16
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,783
- Ça, cidre?
- Oui, oui.

17
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:03,787
- Cinq francs.
- Oh, c'est trop cher. Bonsoir, monsieur.

18
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:05,337
Bonsoir, madame.

19
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:10,170
? Auprés de ma blonde

20
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:12,671
? Qu'il fait bon fait bon fait bon

21
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:15,222
? Auprés de ma blonde

22
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:21,569
Enfin, ma belle.

23
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:25,702
Let go of me! How dare you, you brutes!
Let go of me.

24
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,497
You didn't get away this time, huh?

25
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,285
- She's English.
- What's she doing here?

26
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,833
- Stealing.
- It's a lie! Keep your dirty hands off me!

27
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:37,301
How dare you touch me!

28
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,390
I can buy thousands of bottles of your filthy wine.
I'll show you who I am.

29
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,267
Ah, I didn't recognise you. Forgive me, my lady.

30
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,271
My lady is right, you pig.

31
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:48,775
Qu'est-ce que vous...

32
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:55,955
(Screams)

33
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,019
Here, dearie, it'll do you good.

34
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,084
Thank you, dear.

35
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,998
You've all been very kind.

36
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,009
I didn't mean to get you into trouble.

37
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,923
No trouble at all.

38
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,435
I always wanted to kick that swine in the pants,
anyhow. I'm glad I done it.

39
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,599
I'm English, too.

40
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:38,443
My name's Smith - Mary Smith.
What's yours, dearie?

41
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,572
- Emma.
- Emma.

42
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,196
I knew a girl whose name was Emma.
Emily Burrows.

43
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,332
What's yours?

44
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,460
My name?

45
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:51,005
My name is Emma Lady Hamilton.

46
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,513
Oh...

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,641
That's one on me.

48
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,481
It serves me right. I shouldn't be so nosy.

49
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,438
Well, darlin',
if you don't want to tell me your name,

50
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,734
I'd be the last one to poke my nose
in anybody's secrets.

51
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:12,034
I remember my mother telling me Lady Hamilton
was the most beautiful woman in the world.

52
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:15,792
Have you got a mirror?

53
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,462
Yes.

54
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,765
Better you didn't, dearie.

55
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,598
Oh, well.

56
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,358
I know it.

57
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,489
I know that face.

58
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:35,115
For ten years it has looked back at me
from different mirrors.

59
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:38,204
It must be me.

60
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,549
But I always wait for the miracle,
that one time, just once more,

61
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:47,511
when it will be another face
that looks at me again.

62
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:50,308
A face I knew before.

63
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,312
But that face must be dead.

64
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:59,409
Go on, tell us all about it.

65
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,990
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

66
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:04,126
True or not.

67
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,299
I don't know it myself.

68
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:11,220
It's so long ago, I don't know it anymore.

69
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:18,900
My life really began when I was 18

70
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,613
I was beautiful then

71
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,745
Coach from London!

72
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,954
One day I arrived in Naples

73
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:35,387
At the palace of His Excellency
the British Ambassador

74
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,015
How's London, Gavin?

75
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,018
- How's my nephew? Did he send everything?
- It's all here, Your Excellency.

76
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,821
Give me a hand with this chisel!

77
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:49,609
- Mr Greville sends his regards.
- Don't bother me about Mr Greville now!

78
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:53,704
- Give me a hammer and chisel.
- It's most important, sir.

79
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,143
Exquisite.

80
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,273
Come and look at this.

81
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,364
- Enchanting. Whose work is it?
- George Romney.

82
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,128
If he could paint reality, he would be a master.

83
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,253
Isn't that reality?

84
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,177
The ideal an artist dreams of.

85
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:28,261
No woman ever lived with such colouring,
such god-like simplicity.

86
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,392
I thought so too till I met her.

87
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,891
You've met her?

88
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:36,113
In London, last year. And if you're patient,
you may see her in Naples one day.

89
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:39,366
- Your Excellency.
- Oh, not now, Gavin. I'll see you presently.

90
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:41,493
But I must tell you.

91
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,252
Very well, if you must, but tell me quickly.

92
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:58,683
Mum? Mum? Look, it's lovely.

93
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:00,652
It's a real palace.

94
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:02,447
Oh, I do hope Sir William will like us.

95
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,775
Don't worry, darling. Of course he'll like you.

96
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:08,571
I'll do all the talking. Charlie told me exactly what
to answer to everything.

97
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,834
Why on earth didn't you tell me?
Where are they?

98
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,832
Sshh. Here he comes.

99
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,421
You must forgive me. It's disgraceful.

100
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,723
I'd no idea you'd come.

101
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:23,098
- How do you do, Miss er...
- Emma Hart, if it pleases Your Excellency.

102
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:25,980
- How could I forget?
- This is my mother, Your Excellency.

103
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,782
Welcome to Naples, madam.
This is my friend the French Ambassador.

104
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:31,987
Did you stay in Rome?

105
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:34,788
Yes, Your Excellency
and thought it very beautiful.

106
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:38,711
We saw the Colosseum by moonlight
and were deeply impressed by the Vatican.

107
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,876
We just missed the Pope by ten minutes.

108
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,594
That was a great pity, madam.

109
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,682
Did you come through Pisa?
Did you see the famous leaning tower?

110
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:48,476
Yes, Your Excellency,
and we thought it very beautiful.

111
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:51,522
We thought the leaning tower of Pisa
one of the most remarkable

112
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,690
and lovely phenomena in the whole of Europe.

113
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,988
A chimney went like that in Liverpool last year
at the soap works.

114
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,127
It leant right over the gin warehouse and
the Bishop said it was the finger of God.

115
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:04,713
Charles - Mr Greville - sent you
many kind wishes, Your Excellency.

116
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,044
And he hopes I will prove worthy
of your kindness

117
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:10,640
and speak good French and Italian when
he comes to take me home in October.

118
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,970
He is coming the first week in October.

119
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:18,025
And er... he sent his uncle... a kiss.

120
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:23,619
Well, that's the first present I've ever received
from Charles Greville.

121
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:26,876
I feel sure you must be tired after your journey,
madam.

122
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:29,585
Francis, show the ladies their rooms.

123
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:37,060
Au revoir, madam. Au revoir, Miss Hart.

124
00:09:40,776 --> 00:09:43,233
- Who is she?
- Charles Greville found her.

125
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,197
Where can you find things like that?

126
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,738
Charles happened to find her
at Featherstone Castle - Sir Harry's place.

127
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:51,620
- Oh, she's a relation of Sir Harry?
- You might call her that.

128
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:55,877
She lived there for a whole hunting season
and a very gay hunting season it was, I'm told.

129
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,638
Oh. And where did Sir Harry find her?

130
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:02,769
Well, you remember Dr Graham's Temple of Hell
and the famous dance of the seven veils?

131
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,311
- She's a dancer?
- You might call her that.

132
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,400
She was quite a success.
The fewer the veils the greater the success.

133
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,537
But, alas, the police locked the place
just after the last veil fell.

134
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:16,541
The older I get,
the less I seem to know about women.

135
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:19,499
It's the penalty of your wicked youth,
Your Excellency.

136
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,917
Don't ask me what happened to her before.

137
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:24,052
The usual past, I suppose.

138
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,641
A poor little country girl wronged once
and then wronged again.

139
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:32,439
The old story.
Lower and lower, but always up and up.

140
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,734
And now she's the guest of an ambassador.

141
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,614
With a past like that.

142
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,155
Past?

143
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:43,294
Look at this statue.
Two hundred years in a Greek temple.

144
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,466
Then thrown into the mud
by some barbarian soldier.

145
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:51,429
2,000 years sinking lower and lower into the
mud, then dug up by the plough of a peasant,

146
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:56,977
changing hands every year until at last
it comes to its rightful place.

147
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:00,903
Into the hands of someone
who understands the glory of its beauty.

148
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:07,448
Because, my friend, it is still beautiful, isn't it,
despite its past?

149
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,705
Gavin.

150
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,704
I'll dine tonight with Miss Hart

151
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,792
Alone, at eight o'clock.

152
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:14,594
GAVlN: Yes Your Excellency

153
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,933
Thank you, my man.
I'll ring for you later, if I want you.

154
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,060
Very good, madam.

155
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,358
Two ambassadors, Mum, two!

156
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:27,401
Well, what did you think of me?
Wasn't I wonderful?

157
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,244
You were all that, darling, and more.

158
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,998
So far, so good.

159
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:36,499
But, please, Mum, not another word about the
soap factory. Not till I've married Charlie.

160
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:39,843
Charlie said Sir William was very fussy
about that sort of thing.

161
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,303
Don't worry your pretty head
about Sir William.

162
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:45,265
You'll have him eating out of your hand
within three months.

163
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:48,773
Three months? Three days?
He'll be eating out of it tonight.

164
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,605
And in a month,

165
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:52,987
Charlie will be here to take us home.

166
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,236
How pleased he'll be with me.

167
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,454
He will indeed, but there's no great hurry.

168
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,580
It's very nice here just now
and it's not costing us a farthing.

169
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:05,004
It's all very well for you, but what about me?
''Yes, Your Excellency. No, Your Excellency.

170
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:06,970
Of course, Your Excellency.''

171
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:10,060
- Oh, how I miss my Charlie.
- Yes, he's a likely, young fellow.

172
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:14,016
Burt there's no-one good enough for my Emily,
though it's her own mother who says so.

173
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:18,575
But, Mother, I wouldn't exist without Charlie.
He's done everything for me, everything.

174
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,702
Well, he's... made me a lady.

175
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,580
I know, darling, I know.

176
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,585
Oh! Look at that mountain
with the smoke coming out of it.

177
00:12:25,671 --> 00:12:28,958
The coachman said it went off a few years ago
and killed several people.

178
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,795
That would never happen in Liverpool.

179
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:34,841
Oh, Mother, you're hopeless. That's a famous
volcano. People come miles to see it.

180
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,607
What do they call it? Charles told me 100 times.

181
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:41,026
Smoking mountain. Vesuvius, that's it, Vesuvius.

182
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:44,282
If Sir William asks you what you think
of it, just say it's lovely.

183
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:47,537
- Yes, dear.
- It's mixed up with the history of Ancient Rome.

184
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:50,414
Nero set it on fire and said the Christians did it.

185
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:55,383
Remember, Mother, it's knowing little things
like that that makes you a lady.

186
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:57,511
(String quartet plays minuet)

187
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:33,239
Whenever I have a nice piece of fish,
it always makes me think of the sea.

188
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:35,234
- The what?
- The sea Your Excellency

189
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:36,441
Oh, yes.

190
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:39,208
Charles was wonderful about things like that.

191
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,416
- About fish?
- Oh!

192
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,581
You're so funny, Your Excellency.

193
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:47,092
Every time you call me ''Your Excellency'',
it adds one year to my life.

194
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,387
- Sir William?
- That's getting better

195
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:53,689
Tell me, my dear.
Was my nephew so positive about coming here?

196
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:58,237
Oh, absolutely. He would have brought me here
himself, if he hadn't been detained in London.

197
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,613
Just a second, my dear.

198
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,110
As we're to live together under the same roof

199
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:07,372
I see no reason why we should not
be perfectly frank with one another

200
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:18,182
As much as I hate to spoil this beautiful picture
that you have drawn for yourseIf of my nephew,

201
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:21,144
there's one point that must be made quite clear.

202
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,238
Charles Greville will never come to Naples

203
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,412
But, Your Excellency, Uncle,
he definitely promised.

204
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:34,880
There is a wide gap between my nephew's
promises and his fulfilment of them

205
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:38,052
The promise he gave me, he will keep.

206
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:42,353
Your confidence in him is really touching.

207
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,934
Did he promise you marriage as well?

208
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,357
Why deny it? It must be written all over me.

209
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:53,867
I'm afraid I've got to destroy
those sweet dreams of yours.

210
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:57,789
My nephew never had the slightest intention
of marrying you.

211
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:01,048
Either with my consent or without it.

212
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,256
What did you say, Your Excellency?

213
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:11,521
I said he's not going to marry you, Emma.

214
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,567
But that's not possible.

215
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:20,072
Why should he send me here with my mother?

216
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,207
It costs a lot of money, the journey.

217
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:26,922
Perhaps he feIt you would be better off
with his uncle. A nice vacation.

218
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,049
But I didn't need a vacation.

219
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,591
No. No, there must be something else.

220
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:37,058
And what's to happen after the vacation,
if he doesn't want to marry me?

221
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:40,689
He's talked of nothing else for years.
It was his idea. I never urged him.

222
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,026
I was quite happy with him just as it was.

223
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:48,915
Tell me, Your Excellency,
but please tell me the truth.

224
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,374
Did Charles tell you about me?

225
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:54,510
Do you know about my

226
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:59,060
He did. And I imagine that was the only thing
he did not lie about.

227
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:06,572
Oh but please my dear,
I don't want to make you feel ashamed.

228
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:10,705
Ashamed? Oh, I'm not ashamed.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

229
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:14,375
It's true there were men in my life
before Charles, I admit it.

230
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:16,836
I made mistakes, I was young, I was stupid.

231
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,050
I believed in men and their promises.

232
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:21,808
Charles knew about me
before he took me into the house,

233
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,600
before he promised to marry me.

234
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:27,520
And now I'm different, not only my clothes,
but inside.

235
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:30,101
I'm good. I know I'm good.

236
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,237
So why should he lie to me?

237
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,245
Why did he send me here?
What am I doing here?

238
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,705
Charles had a lot of debts. Did you know that?

239
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:39,621
Yes, quite a lot, I know.

240
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:43,213
His debts have been paid to the tune of £5,000.

241
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:47,846
Besides he has plenty of cash
to save him from new debts for a long time

242
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:55,521
Oh, I see.

243
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,448
see

244
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:08,425
He sold you antiques, paintings, and among
the bric-a-brac, a certain Emma Hart.

245
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,930
(Sobs) That wasn't fair.
That wasn't gentlemanlike.

246
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,555
He shouldn't have raised me up
just to throw me down again.

247
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:18,894
My dear.

248
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:20,859
Leave me alone. You're just as bad as he is.

249
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:23,949
Perhaps you haven't made
such a good bargain after all.

250
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,446
I'm not going to stay here.

251
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:28,112
I'm going away now. Now!

252
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:32,335
(Sobs)

253
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,674
Oh, don't take it to heart, my dear.

254
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:42,139
Forget Charles, forget the old memories,
forget London.

255
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,235
I can offer you a new life
and a far more exciting one.

256
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,361
Naples is a wonderful city.

257
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:50,285
You'll be a success here. You'll like it.

258
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,408
Perhaps not today, nor even tomorrow.

259
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,704
But you are young and the young heal quickly.

260
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:06,183
You will learn singing and music
under the greatest masters in Italy.

261
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,523
You will speak French and Italian
with our finest teachers.

262
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:12,862
Everyone of account in Europe comes to my
house. You will meet them all.

263
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:16,117
You will dine with famous soldiers,
artists and statesmen.

264
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:20,915
You can't be presented at court, of course,
but you will have a villa by the sea and a coach.

265
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:23,460
You will have your private box at the opera.

266
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,169
Ever since I first saw you in London,
I feIt this house of mine to be empty,

267
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:30,017
missing its greatest and most lovely ornament.

268
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:32,260
You will be that ornament, my dear.

269
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:35,227
And except for that absurd presentation at court,

270
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:39,365
you will have everything in life
that a woman could possibly dream of.

271
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,246
What did you say?

272
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,160
Nothing. Try to sleep.

273
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,295
Goodnight, Emma.

274
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,896
MOTHER: What's wrong, darling?

275
00:18:57,979 --> 00:18:59,392
Oh, mum!

276
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,524
Dear, dear.

277
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:03,653
(Sobs) Mum, I'm so miserable.

278
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:07,942
- What's wrong?
- He never wanted to marry me.

279
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:13,248
He got £5,000 from the old man
to send me here.

280
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,464
He never wanted to marry me.

281
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:19,924
Don't cry, my sweet.
You're too good for any of them.

282
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:21,428
I'm going to pack now.

283
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,764
We'll go right back to London and you can give
that precious Mr Greville a piece of your mind.

284
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,441
Plenty of good men want to marry my Emily.
There, now, darling. Don't cry.

285
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:34,823
There's just as good fish in the sea
as ever came out of it.

286
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,873
(Emma Sobs)
Darling, precious Emily, there, now.

287
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,512
EMMA: And I forgot London
and the old memories.

288
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:46,967
I was young I healed quickly.

289
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,396
I learnt French, Italian, singing, and music.

290
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,738
One day I had more than I ever dreamed of.

291
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:59,492
I became his wife - Emma Lady Hamilton.

292
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:14,978
(Singing)

293
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:19,483
Sshh!

294
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:22,111
My daughter, Her Ladyship, is still asleep.

295
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,195
- Good morning, Contessa.
- Good morning.

296
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:28,750
My daughter, Her Ladyship, is still resting.
Perhaps you wouldn't mind waiting a little while.

297
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:32,968
- How was Her Majesty this morning?
- Her cold is troublesome. Her throat is sore.

298
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,678
- Has it gone out of her nose?
-No.

299
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:39,263
The best way to cure a sore throat
is to wrap a woollen sock at night, going to bed.

300
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:42,144
- Oh?
- Good morning. Good morning, Contessa.

301
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:43,777
Good morning, Your Excellency.

302
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:46,105
- Is Emma still asleep?
- She is asleep.

303
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:50,413
In my village, a husband just turns round in bed
and looks for himseIf to know.

304
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:54,333
Yes, and the Queen of Naples does not wear
woollen socks to pin around her throat.

305
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:59,001
If the Queen of Naples wore a hefty pair of
woollen socks, she wouldn't have a sore throat.

306
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:01,678
(Explosion outside)

307
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,260
(Explosion)

308
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:08,311
- What's happened?
- I don't know.

309
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:10,064
(Explosion)

310
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,614
Maybe the smoking mountain went off again.

311
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:17,161
Let's see. Come along.

312
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,378
(Explosions continue)

313
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:26,553
(Explosion)

314
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:32,941
How wonderful! A battleship.

315
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:43,163
You should see the Queen about this.
Salutes at this hour of the morning.

316
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,836
Why shouldn't they blow their cannons off?
That's what they've got them for.

317
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:48,039
Boom!

318
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,888
- Boom!
- Good morning, my dear.

319
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:56,017
Boom! Good morning, William.

320
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:58,562
Here, give it to me.

321
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,822
? Rule Britannia

322
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:09,957
Let me look, my dear.

323
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:15,842
There's a small boat coming ashore.

324
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,181
They will probably need me.
Excuse me, my dear.

325
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:33,370
- The mail is just in, Emma.
- I'll attend to it later.

326
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,369
Here's a nice fat one from London.

327
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:36,791
Oh.

328
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,881
(Reads) Her Excellency, Emma Lady Hamilton,
British Embassy, Naples.

329
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,384
Charles Greville, London.

330
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,518
Open it, child, open it.

331
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:51,601
I think not. Send it back
and write on it, ''Unopened. Return to sender''.

332
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:55,031
Poor Charles. He's exactly three years too late.

333
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:58,241
And as far as I'm concerned,
he simply doesn't exist.

334
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:02,836
Are you happy, my child?

335
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,461
Happy?

336
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:10,264
Three years ago, my only idea of happiness
was to be married to Charles Greville.

337
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,394
After that, I wanted revenge.

338
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,650
Well, I got that in a way, too.

339
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,899
Then I wanted to be presented at court.

340
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:22,782
And even that impossible wish was granted
to me.

341
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,624
I've got everything.

342
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:29,999
Everything a woman of the world
could possibly wish for.

343
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,718
So why shouldn't I be happy?

344
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:35,096
Of course, I'm happy, Mother.

345
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,223
Well, Emma, what's good enough for you
is good enough for me.

346
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:41,519
And being mother to Her Ladyship
is not to be sneezed at either.

347
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:43,569
(Laughs)
- You silly old thing.

348
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,231
You're lovely, Emma.
You're so beautiful, Emma.

349
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:51,039
And what about you? Look at you with
your little cap and your silver buttons.

350
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:53,584
And your beautiful skirt.

351
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,715
You're the beautiful one.

352
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,377
Your Ladyship,
could you spare me a moment, please?

353
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:00,134
Yes, Gavin. I'm in a great hurry.

354
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:03,180
It's about the dinner invitations for Sunday night.

355
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:07,141
Then, of course, His Eminence the Archbishop,
the Duchess of Argyle,

356
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:10,322
and if there's no performance
the Prima Donna of the San Carlo.

357
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,245
- And the two ladies - which is deaf?
- The Contessa Giovanni.

358
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,955
We put her on Sir William's right.

359
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,127
Marquess Compiani the old harpy,
and the French Ambassador -

360
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:19,957
we'll put him there between them.

361
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,508
Oh, he'll have a nice time.

362
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:25,891
Beg pardon, My Lady, but Sir William informs
me the French Ambassador cannot be invited.

363
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:28,851
- Why ever not?
- Sir William mentioned

364
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:33,770
Sir William mentioned... Sir William mentioned
there's a difference between the er...

365
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:36,950
William, what's this absurd business
about the French Ambassador?

366
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:38,911
l need him for the party on Sunday night.

367
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:41,833
My dear, may I introduce
the captain of the Agamemnon?

368
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,710
How do you do? But William, I need him.

369
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:47,796
He's amusing and he's a bachelor and I need
a single man to make my number even.

370
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:52,100
I'm sorry, my dear, but we won't be seeing
the French Ambassador for quite some time.

371
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,810
Why? What's the matter with him?

372
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:55,725
The captain can explain that.

373
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:58,107
- He has a message.
- We're at war with France.

374
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,697
War? That's torn it.
Bang goes the French Ambassador.

375
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:06,579
Oh, dear. Who can I get to sit between
these two dreary old ladies?

376
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,423
My dear captain, we shall be so delighted
if you will dine with us on Sunday night.

377
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,968
You will sit between the two most amusing
and charming ladies in Naples.

378
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:21,020
You're very kind, but I sail tonight.

379
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,266
Oh, then I gather you must be in a hurry.

380
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,614
Don't let me disturb your conference. I'm going.

381
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:33,085
Well, Captain, you were saying
that the Admiral of the Fleet wanted...

382
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:34,712
Yes, sir.

383
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,506
Lord Hood advised me to instruct you...

384
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:45,470
It's all right, Captain,
I have no secrets from Lady Hamilton.

385
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:47,938
I'm very sorry, Sir William. You must forgive me.

386
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:51,445
I'm not used to discussing matters of this kind
in the presence of ladies.

387
00:25:51,532 --> 00:25:54,570
Oh. Is it as wicked as all that? Good gracious.

388
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,371
I promised to be with the Queen at 1 2.

389
00:25:56,456 --> 00:26:00,077
She won't order a single new dress
until I've discussed the patterns with her.

390
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,462
That's a very great responsibility, my dear.

391
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:04,592
- Goodbye, William.
- Goodbye.

392
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:11,812
We've captured Toulon.

393
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:15,851
The Admiral needs 10 000 troops to hold it
It would take three weeks from England

394
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,107
From here, they should be in Toulon in two
days.

395
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,406
The treaty between England and Naples
provides full co-operation

396
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,917
and the Admiral expects you to secure those
troops from the King of Naples.

397
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,295
I'll apply for an audience with the King.

398
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:31,430
But surely in a matter as urgent as this,
we could see the King at once.

399
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:35,016
At once? I can't just walk into the Royal Palace.

400
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:37,975
Well, when will you get the audience?

401
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:40,690
Friday may be possible.
Saturday almost certain.

402
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,236
But we must have these troops immediately.

403
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:47,955
You must leave this in my hands.
You see, I know these people and you don't.

404
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,082
I'll make out the application at once.

405
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,405
EMMA: Yes, that's me too.

406
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,870
Do you like it? It's a Romney.

407
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:15,495
Circe watching her lover sail away.

408
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:18,245
Is it?

409
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,093
You know, I could get you those troops like that.

410
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:27,808
You were speaking rather loudly, Captain, and
the houses get so stuffy if you close the doors.

411
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:31,352
You're worried, aren't you?
You have an important mission, haven't you?

412
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:34,864
Has it ever occurred to you that women can
sometimes be of more help than men?

413
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:36,946
Not in a matter of this kind, Lady Hamilton.

414
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,285
How do you know?

415
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:43,372
It just happens that I shall be seeing the Queen
within the next ten minutes.

416
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:46,918
The Queen? This is an important matter of state.

417
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:49,634
All the more reason to see the Queen.

418
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,306
Now I'll let you into a secret, Captain.

419
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,440
Which everyone in Europe knows.

420
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:57,153
Except you, Captain.

421
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:00,859
The real King of Naples is the Queen.

422
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:03,242
E licenziata, hai capito?

423
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,002
(The children's chatter drowns her out)

424
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:14,423
Her Majesty is pleased
to be with her children this hour.

425
00:28:14,517 --> 00:28:17,305
But my orders are to let My Lady in any time.

426
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:23,022
Even if the princes and princesses please
to be with their august parents.

427
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:25,404
The august family appears to be pretty big.

428
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:28,744
The marriage of the august parents
is continuously blessed.

429
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:32,666
There are 15 princes and princesses so far.
You will see.

430
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:34,795
(Pandemonium)

431
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,174
Lady Hamilton!

432
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:10,353
(Dog barks)

433
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:25,331
(Pandemonium drowns out conversation)

434
00:29:27,052 --> 00:29:30,673
''I have the honour to be etc, etc, etc.''
And I'll sign it at once.

435
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:32,764
Phew!

436
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:48,915
Here we are, Captain. I'll have this application
to the palace in haIf an hour.

437
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:53,052
I thought it advisable to ask for only 8,000 men.
We may get as many as 5,000.

438
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:57,267
We asked for 20,000 and we got 1 0,000. There.

439
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:01,813
I'm very much indebted to Lady Hamilton

440
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,272
Her campaign against the Queen
was a masterpiece of strategy.

441
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:08,818
Well, there, my dear captain,
you see the real Ambassador to Naples.

442
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:10,740
At least to the Queen of Naples.

443
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:14,913
Captain, now that you have your soldiers,
there's no need for you to leave so soon.

444
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:18,258
You can go tomorrow. We'll have a wonderful
party on your ship tonight.

445
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:22,974
I'll bring the Queen and you'll get the King if
you'll allow him to conduct the ship's orchestra.

446
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:26,763
We'll sail out to Capri.
By midnight, we'll be at the Blue Grotto.

447
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:31,154
Capri by moonlight.
You've no idea how beautiful the world can be.

448
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,320
We'll decorate the ship with flowers. And I'll
dance. I expect you've heard of my dances.

449
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:39,169
The Dance Of The Nymph
goes beautifully with a night on a ship

450
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:44,547
I'll wear a long tunic of pale blue cashmere.

451
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:48,557
No high coiffure. Just loose hair.

452
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:52,264
Like a Greek Goddess Gavin we're to have
a party on the battleship tonight

453
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:54,981
Get out the Chinese lanterns
to send to the harbour.

454
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,027
And ask the chef to make big steak pies,
100 of them.

455
00:30:58,118 --> 00:31:01,453
And get some rum for the sailors.
It is rum they drink, isn't it, Captain?

456
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,664
It will be magnificent, stupendous.

457
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,292
- Won't I be wonderful, William?
- You will.

458
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:10,463
I'm sorry to be ungallant, but I've just been
summoned to weigh anchor immediately.

459
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:14,970
May I present my son,
midshipman on the Agamemnon?

460
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:16,772
Such a big son.

461
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:19,100
- My step-son.
-Your wife lives in England?

462
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:20,774
Yes, sir, in Norfolk.

463
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:23,737
And this young man is your chaperone.

464
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:26,069
Precisely. He keeps a good watch on me.

465
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:28,702
- Goodbye, Sir William.
- Goodbye, Captain.

466
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,252
Goodbye, Lady Hamilton.

467
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,875
May I say,
you've done good service for your country?

468
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:37,382
It's been rather fun, hasn't it? If you're passing
Naples again, I hope you'll come and see us.

469
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:42,019
And next time, there's no need to blow off
your cannons, just knock at the door.

470
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:43,269
Goodbye.

471
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:44,984
What was your name?

472
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,731
Nelson.

473
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:56,287
William, did I seem very silly,
talking about the party in the moonlight?

474
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,421
Silly? Of course, my dear.

475
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:01,511
But delightfully silly. My Emma at her best.

476
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:03,471
I wonder.

477
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:05,598
He was so serious.

478
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,928
All of a sudden, I began to feel foolish.

479
00:32:08,022 --> 00:32:12,772
I don't think a woman can be at her best,
playing the fool with news of war.

480
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,491
Don't think about it, my dear.

481
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:18,244
War is a sordid, ugly thing,
so there's no need for them to bother you.

482
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,457
My Lady, your dancing master's here.

483
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:23,215
- Shall I show him to the dancing room?
-No, send him away.

484
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:25,626
- But, Emma.
- I don't feel like dancing.

485
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,256
William, you've left certain gaps in my
education. This war, for instance.

486
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,309
- I know nothing about it.
- But my dear...

487
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:34,683
Every time I ask you a serious question,
you begin shuffling about.

488
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,817
Tell me about it. How did it happen?

489
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:40,820
- It's very dull, my dear.
- I don't care how dull it is. I want to know.

490
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:42,536
Well...

491
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:44,248
here's England.

492
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:48,171
Such a tiny little bit.

493
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,668
Where are we?

494
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,465
Here at Naples.

495
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,098
But why should England fight?

496
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:58,314
Because all through these centuries,
she has built up a commonwealth,

497
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,730
in which every little spot has its purpose
and value to the balance line of life.

498
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:07,202
And there are always men,
who for the sake of their insane ambition,

499
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:09,614
want to destroy what other people build.

500
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:13,959
And therefore, this tiny little bit,
as you call it, Emma,

501
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:20,173
has to send out its ships again and again to fight
those who want to dictate their will to others.

502
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,601
EMMA: Then came five years of war

503
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:26,898
We fought alone with no allies

504
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:31,401
The whole of Europe in deadly fear
of Napoleon Bonaparte

505
00:33:32,704 --> 00:33:36,834
Nothing between him and the conquest
of the world but a few ships

506
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,923
And Nelson

507
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:47,221
MAN: His Majesty is pleased to award you
the Knighthood of the Bath

508
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:50,434
and you are promoted to Rear Admiral
of the Blue

509
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:53,730
Sir Horatio, that's wonderful.
The men will be delighted.

510
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:55,364
Oh, yes.

511
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:59,579
We'll catch Bonaparte in a week,
if we have an extra button on our coat tails.

512
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:04,377
Five years of this war and gentlemen in London
think that men can go on without water or food.

513
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:06,672
And I can fight the enemy without ammunition.

514
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,092
Even His Excellency the Ambassador here
sees fit to ignore our plight.

515
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:12,762
What's the matter with the lamp?

516
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,392
It's nearly empty, sir. No more oil on board.

517
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,360
Well, turn it down.

518
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:23,027
NELSON: Hardy?
- Yes, sir.

519
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,664
Sir Horatio from now on, sir.

520
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,789
Oh, not to you, Hardy.

521
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:29,333
Captain always, I hope.

522
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,210
Captain or Sir Horatio,
I can't stand this any longer.

523
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,010
What's Sir William Hamilton doing?

524
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:36,849
Why don't we sail up to Naples
and blow 'em out of their beds?

525
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,975
They'd give us water and meat then.

526
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:42,232
- Do you expect me to fire at a neutral port?
- Neutral?

527
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:44,359
Neutral against England?

528
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:48,281
Yes. Things were different when we were here
five years ago, weren't they?

529
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,613
Our braid was shining in those days.

530
00:34:50,707 --> 00:34:54,624
Today they won't even let us anchor
in the harbour as though we had the plague.

531
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:58,381
They're so scared of Bonaparte,
they daren't help the people who fight him.

532
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:00,931
Starboard!

533
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,692
What a wonderful way to get upstairs.

534
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,200
How exciting.

535
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,455
At last I'm on a battleship.

536
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:22,921
NELSON: Trowbridge, did you get anything?

537
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,802
Sir, there is someone here with me.

538
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,427
- The Ambassador.
- No sir Lady Hamilton

539
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:30,056
Is there no light? I can't see anything.

540
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,186
Everything's so dark.

541
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:34,814
Where's Horatio?

542
00:35:34,904 --> 00:35:37,064
Turn up the lamp Josiah

543
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:42,364
NELSON: How is Sir William? Ill, I presume?

544
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,996
You must please forgive me
if I seem a little abrupt.

545
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,675
We've been living here under great difficulties.
No food or fresh water.

546
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,424
No rum no tobacco

547
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:57,478
The Neapolitans have forgotten that they're our
allies and that we're fighting for their cause too.

548
00:35:57,566 --> 00:36:00,937
That is why I sent Trowbridge to ask Sir William

549
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,071
to remind the King...

550
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:05,199
What is the matter?

551
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,255
Oh... Why, I'm sorry, yes.

552
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:22,979
You must please excuse these little souvenirs
of Calvi and Tenerife.

553
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,106
I had no idea.

554
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:30,489
They told us of your victories,
but not of the price you had paid.

555
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,988
Do not distress yourself, please.

556
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,325
Tell me your news. Did Sir William see the King?

557
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:38,756
- The King refused to see him.
- Refused to see the British Ambassador?

558
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:41,381
I ought to have said
he was too terrified to see him.

559
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:43,466
You cannot realise how Naples has changed.

560
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,060
Have they gone out of their senses?
What do they think I am trying to do?

561
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:50,769
Bonaparte's fleet is in Egypt.
For the first time I know where they are.

562
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:54,150
If I can smash them up,
Europe has a chance to breathe again.

563
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:56,283
And it's the first time he's been stopped.

564
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:58,910
And yet they will not give me food or water
for my ships.

565
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,457
When I saw that William was wasting his time,

566
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,705
I took the liberty of seeing the Queen.

567
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:07,302
I've never had such a time in all my life.
She's terrified of the French.

568
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:10,096
- But I got it.
- What is that?

569
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:12,974
A mandate, signed and sealed
by the Queen's own hand,

570
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:17,695
for the full watering and victualling of the British
fleet in any port in the Kingdom of Naples.

571
00:37:17,781 --> 00:37:19,609
There.

572
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:33,756
Look out, Bonaparte.
By gad, we shall lick you now.

573
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:45,447
Tell the Queen I kiss her letter.

574
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:50,116
Tell her I hope to kiss her hand
when we return from our victory.

575
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:53,377
Won't you sit down? You must be tired.

576
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:01,635
Do you remember the picnic we planned at
Capri on your ship?

577
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,812
When I was going to dance in the moonlight
with my hair down five years ago.

578
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,730
Or was it five centuries?

579
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:10,030
When I rudely sailed away.

580
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:14,745
And now you're going to rudely sail away again.
How's it been with you all these years?

581
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:16,991
Alone, you know.

582
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:20,292
You've done a great many things.
How is your wife?

583
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:23,256
Oh, she's well enough, I believe.

584
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:25,554
And when are you going to meet Bonaparte?

585
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:27,552
- Soon, I hope.
- He's got haIf of Europe

586
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:29,021
Now it's Egypt.

587
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,648
Tomorrow it may be lndia.

588
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,735
We are alone, but unafraid.

589
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:35,365
SAlLOR: Haul away!

590
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,029
You long to leave, don't you?

591
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,161
Never lose an hour or waste a wind

592
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:42,620
Goodbye, Sir Horatio.
It's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?

593
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:44,753
Yes. Goodbye, Lady Hamilton.

594
00:38:44,841 --> 00:38:47,759
You've helped us for the second time.

595
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,263
EMMA:
He didn't lose an hour. He didn't waste a wind.

596
00:38:53,354 --> 00:38:56,939
He met his great opponent
and he defeated him on the Nile

597
00:38:58,362 --> 00:39:05,248
And when the battle was over
he didn't go back to his country or to his king

598
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:07,373
or to his wife

599
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,502
he came back

600
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:11,215
to me

601
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:15,177
(Band plays)
? A Life On The Ocean Wave

602
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:39,881
? Fanfare

603
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,856
- Stop. Fetch a doctor quickly.
(Band stops playing)

604
00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:56,039
Fetch a doctor quickly. Send everyone away.
A doctor quickly.

605
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:58,498
(Murmuring)

606
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,719
What's come over you, madam?

607
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,933
A doctor? Who wants a doctor?

608
00:40:14,821 --> 00:40:17,859
But you staggered out there and nearly fell.

609
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:20,993
I'm perfectly well.

610
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:29,049
GUARD: Shoul...der!

611
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:38,526
Your Majesty, I'm amazed.

612
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:40,852
Cosa dice?

613
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:43,319
l must speak to the King. Help me, Sir William.

614
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,281
Lui vuole parlare con te.

615
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:48,704
Va bene.

616
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:51,416
Aspetta qui.

617
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,966
Tell him I didn't come to Naples to be feted.

618
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:59,342
In other times, I should be grateful,
but today I am appalled by it.

619
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:02,973
I came here expecting to find an armed camp
and I find this tragic carnival.

620
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:06,688
This Battle of the Nile that he's celebrating
may have destroyed their fleet,

621
00:41:06,782 --> 00:41:09,535
but his army's as strong as ever
and two days' from Naples.

622
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,240
Yet the men of Naples dance in the streets
with paper caps and toy balloons.

623
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:17,119
Maestà, Nelson dice che non è venuto
à Napoli per...

624
00:41:17,214 --> 00:41:19,208
Qu'est qu'il y a, ma chère?

625
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:24,552
He says he has confidence in the English
and feels sure they will do what is necessary.

626
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:29,023
Well, tell him we're not the guardian angels of
every country too lazy to look after itself.

627
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:31,150
You've got to do something too!

628
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,073
At the Nile, we cleared them off the seas,
but as long as they have armies on land,

629
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:38,698
no country in Europe is free.
They want to get hold of the whole world.

630
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:41,374
If you value your freedom, stir yourselves.

631
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:43,790
Prepare and help drive them off the land!

632
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:45,961
Ma perche l'Ammiraglio è cosi nervoso?

633
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:48,974
I'm talking of Bonaparte, Your Majesty!
Bonaparte!

634
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:54,684
Either advance toward him sword in hand
or else be kicked out of your kingdom.

635
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:57,398
Lady Hamilton, may I speak to you?

636
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:07,419
You called for a doctor just now.

637
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:10,877
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
I thought you were ill.

638
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:13,758
Well, for heaven's sake...

639
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:17,350
..where is the doctor?

640
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,932
This is the third time you've helped me.

641
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:50,779
You've been here night and day. How long?

642
00:42:50,867 --> 00:42:52,908
EMMA: Nine days

643
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:57,457
- What an enormous bed.
- It's my bed

644
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,716
There's room for six people in it.

645
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:03,211
There may be. I've never tried.

646
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:04,931
Why am in your bed?

647
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:07,259
They couldn't move you to the hospital

648
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,155
Of all that ghastly crowd, you were
the only one who knew that I was ill.

649
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:18,283
A nice cup of beef tea.

650
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,791
- That'll put some go into him.
- Who's that?

651
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:24,919
It's all right, milord. Just Emma's mother.

652
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:27,049
Emma's mother...

653
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,754
..do you think I could call her Emma too?

654
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:34,269
Why ask me?
You've been calling her Emma all this time.

655
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:36,397
Now, don't say anymore.

656
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,903
Here you are.

657
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:42,404
There.

658
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:46,280
Now I'll tell you all the news
and all the gossip too, if you're interested.

659
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:50,790
First item, the King of England is pleased
to elevate Sir Horatio Nelson to the peerage.

660
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:52,923
You are now Lord Nelson.

661
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:57,343
Second item, the King of Naples has given you
the dukedom of Bronte.

662
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,679
You are now a duke and a baron.

663
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:03,987
Third item, the whole of Europe sings
your praises, the victor of the Nile.

664
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:07,109
It wouldn't have been possible without you.

665
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:10,655
I'm going to tell them.
I'm going to let the whole world know.

666
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:13,076
I told you not to talk. You've got to rest.

667
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:17,384
In a week, you can get up. Then for another
week, you can have nothing but goat's milk.

668
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:21,931
Disgusting.
I shall be able to get up in a day or two..

669
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:25,352
You can get up
when you are told you can get up.

670
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:28,858
Yes, ma'am. Goat's milk for a week and
I get up when I'm told.

671
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:30,987
(Laughs) That's better.

672
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:33,115
We need you now, Lord Nelson.

673
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,529
In these times the whole world needs you.

674
00:44:35,623 --> 00:44:37,664
And I need you more than anyone else.

675
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:41,336
As soon as you are well, the King has
commanded a gala performance of the opera

676
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:43,797
and I want to wear my new dress from London.

677
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,133
Gala performance?

678
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:48,978
Opera?
When they ought to be mobilising armies.

679
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,601
They're doomed and don't want to realise it.

680
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:53,732
You mustn't excite yourself.

681
00:44:57,784 --> 00:45:02,164
Would you do me a kindness
and write a letter for me, Emma?

682
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,793
Of course.

683
00:45:05,714 --> 00:45:07,755
To whom?

684
00:45:07,842 --> 00:45:09,836
Lady Nelson.

685
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:15,555
Burnham Thorpe Norfolk England

686
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:21,360
I wonder what she looks like now.

687
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:23,488
I haven't seen her for seven years

688
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,331
I wonder why we sailors ever marry

689
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,325
Do you want that to go in?

690
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:31,421
Good heavens, no. (Laughs)

691
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:35,258
My dear wife

692
00:45:35,345 --> 00:45:37,054
My dear wife...

693
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,345
My heartiest greetings from Naples
to you and Father.

694
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,399
I'm in the house of the Hamiltons

695
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:52,871
and it has taken all their care
and kindness to pull me through.

696
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:59,463
I hope some day to have the pleasure
of introducing you to Lady Hamilton

697
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,266
Lady Hamilton is one of the very best women
in the world...

698
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:11,023
and an honour to her sex

699
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:27,093
? La ci darem la mano

700
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:31,015
? La mi dirai di si

701
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:36,818
? Vedi, non è lontano

702
00:46:36,904 --> 00:46:41,736
? Partiam, ben mio, da qui

703
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,239
? Vorrei e mon ver-rai

704
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,375
(King hums)

705
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:48,253
Ferdinando!

706
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:52,838
? Mi tremaun pocoil cor

707
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,395
? Felice e ver sarei

708
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:02,691
? Ma puo burlarmiancor

709
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:09,870
? Neopolitan folk song

710
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:29,362
Do you know what they're having
at the palace now?

711
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:32,155
Mushrooms from Switzerland,
pheasants from England,

712
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:33,990
wine from Spain.

713
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:36,621
120 years old and £5 a bottle.

714
00:47:36,711 --> 00:47:39,168
And here sits the hero of the evening
missing it all.

715
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,136
Are you missing it all?

716
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:46,639
Of course not. The real and exclusive party
of the evening is here.

717
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:49,646
Besides, I know exactly
what's happening at the palace.

718
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:51,774
The Queen...

719
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:54,354
Ferdinando! Taci! Taci! Ferdinando!

720
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:58,116
And the King, the poor little King
with 15 children and the Kingdom of Naples

721
00:47:58,205 --> 00:48:00,449
and never an answer to give to his queen.

722
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:02,582
And here sits the British Ambassador.

723
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,708
Bored and dreaming only
of his last statue from Pompeii.

724
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,253
And throughout the evening
there sits Lord Nelson,

725
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:12,350
exhibiting his various moods one by one.

726
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:14,975
Lord Nelson in a bad mood.

727
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:17,106
Lord Nelson in a good mood.

728
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,152
Lord Nelson in an exuberant mood.

729
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,536
(He laughs) Am I really such a dull fellow?

730
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:25,948
Only when you ask questions like that.

731
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:29,211
And now it's my turn to give you
a little presentation.

732
00:48:29,297 --> 00:48:31,042
What mood is this?

733
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:33,259
One guess.

734
00:48:36,977 --> 00:48:42,519
Nelson allowing himself
to be just a little bit happy?

735
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,443
Nelson in love.

736
00:48:57,218 --> 00:48:59,888
(Raucous laughter)

737
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:04,770
(Outburst of laughter)

738
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,315
Of all the inns in Naples, you choose this one.

739
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:18,159
Probably the last place in Naples
where they expected to find me.

740
00:49:18,252 --> 00:49:20,127
Were you at the opera tonight, my dear?

741
00:49:20,214 --> 00:49:22,254
No? You should have been.

742
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:24,670
There was quite a profusion of barmaids.

743
00:49:24,763 --> 00:49:28,134
Some even found their way to the royal box

744
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:29,888
(Laughter)

745
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,558
He's drunk.

746
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:35,399
l see you're not married, my dear. What a pity.

747
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:39,323
Married women are bestowing their favours
so cheaply these days

748
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:42,368
He's never behaved like this before.

749
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:46,293
Friends, I give you the real hero of the hour.

750
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:48,091
Sir William Hamilton.

751
00:49:48,177 --> 00:49:50,217
(Laughter)

752
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:57,312
That's an excellent toast, Josiah.

753
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,610
May I drink it with you?

754
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:07,280
Thank you.

755
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:08,918
Sir William Hamilton.

756
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:15,547
Lady Hamilton and I are leaving. Fetch a cab.

757
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:19,884
Don't let us disturb you, lads. You're off duty.

758
00:50:24,946 --> 00:50:26,524
Enjoy yourselves.

759
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:37,376
Forgive them, my dear.

760
00:50:37,464 --> 00:50:40,004
They are very... very young.

761
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:43,090
I have forgiven them.

762
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:46,179
That's the way people look at these things.

763
00:50:46,272 --> 00:50:49,773
They do not believe in a friendship
between a man and a woman.

764
00:50:52,823 --> 00:50:54,817
Do you?

765
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:35,598
All right, later. Later.

766
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:43,362
It was magnificent! Stupendous!

767
00:51:43,447 --> 00:51:45,573
Wasn't I wonderful, William?

768
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,321
Wasn't it a success?

769
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:50,784
A triumph.
The greatest ball ever seen in Naples.

770
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:52,918
You were stupendous.

771
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:56,459
You entertained 200 people as easily
as you enchant a solitary husband.

772
00:51:56,553 --> 00:52:02,476
The King said to me, ''Milady, la sua bellezza mi
fa dimenticare tutte le pensieri della realta.''

773
00:52:02,563 --> 00:52:06,610
And Hardy, good old Hardy said,
''Well, I'll be blowed, Your Ladyship.

774
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:10,315
What I mean to say is,
well, you know what I mean.''

775
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:13,246
And... Oh, goodness! I'm so tired!

776
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,910
What did he say?

777
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,412
He who?

778
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:17,999
He.

779
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,425
Oh, he didn't say anything.
He never says much, you know.

780
00:52:22,512 --> 00:52:26,346
People were saying that he should have sat
on your right during dinner,

781
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:27,680
not on your left

782
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:32,067
What? And give the Queen the side
with the eye on it? Not likely.

783
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,483
He seemed very happy.

784
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:37,025
Yes, I really think he's better now.

785
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,493
Tonight, he seemed to forget everything.

786
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:41,824
Ships, the war, Napoleon, everything.

787
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:45,871
Could any man think of worldly cares
in the spell of Emma's magic?

788
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:48,721
He deserved his happiness this evening

789
00:52:48,806 --> 00:52:52,759
After such happiness how sad to find oneself
the next morning at sea again.

790
00:52:52,854 --> 00:52:54,895
And at war

791
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:59,689
What do you mean?
We're going to Pompeii tomorrow.

792
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:01,608
Lord Nelson will be on his way to Malta.

793
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,239
I think there must be some mistake, William.

794
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:07,951
Lord Nelson left ten minutes ago and said
he would be with us at 12 tomorrow.

795
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:11,048
The dispatch arrived while dessert
was being served.

796
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:13,294
I had it sent straight aboard his ship

797
00:53:13,388 --> 00:53:16,474
He's probably reading it at this very moment

798
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:19,929
Why didn't you tell me this before, William?

799
00:53:20,023 --> 00:53:23,775
But my dear I wouldn't have spoilt
your evening for anything in the world

800
00:53:23,864 --> 00:53:26,486
You mean,
you wouldn't have spoiled yours for anything.

801
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:30,196
You tried to prevent me
from saying goodbye to him

802
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:33,752
You know Emma

803
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:37,123
there are three kinds of deceived husbands
in the world.

804
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:39,840
First there are those
who were born to be deceived.

805
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,972
Second, who do not know.

806
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,433
And third, who do not care.

807
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:48,736
I've been wondering for some time now,
which of the three I should be myself.

808
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,395
Have you forgotten the fourth kind, William?

809
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:55,788
The kind that is hard and empty
and gives nothing.

810
00:53:56,917 --> 00:54:00,288
You married me because you wanted
a new ornament for your house.

811
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:04,001
Like that painting or that statue or that vase.

812
00:54:05,097 --> 00:54:08,468
As far as you're concerned,
I'm just as ornamental.

813
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,353
And just as dead.

814
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:13,810
But, my dear,
how can you call my statues dead?

815
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:18,782
When I'm alone and rather tired, think what
it means for me to have my statues with me.

816
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,444
To know that they'll always be lovely,

817
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,492
will never grow old,
and never walk out with sailors.

818
00:54:30,722 --> 00:54:33,131
What a pity you're not going to see him again.

819
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:36,810
It would have been a farewell scene
of lasting beauty.

820
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,940
I shall sleep beautifully tonight.

821
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:41,069
Good night, my dear.

822
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:02,565
My darling...come back.

823
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:06,067
Come back.

824
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:13,199
Emily, he's waiting for you...out on the balcony.

825
00:55:55,027 --> 00:55:57,068
(Bell rings)

826
00:55:57,156 --> 00:55:59,196
(Foghorn)

827
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:06,247
You shouldn't have come.
People will see you. They'll talk.

828
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:08,829
Oh, let them talk. I don't care. Do you?

829
00:56:08,924 --> 00:56:11,002
Are you sorry?

830
00:56:11,095 --> 00:56:14,466
I'm only sorry for all the wasted years
I've been without you.

831
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,885
For all the years I shall have to be without you.

832
00:56:16,979 --> 00:56:18,725
You'll come back, won't you?

833
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:21,858
I wonder if I shall.

834
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,987
I feel I should not.

835
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:26,115
You are married and I am married.

836
00:56:27,454 --> 00:56:31,538
In the magic and music and the ballroom,
these things become rather blurred.

837
00:56:31,628 --> 00:56:34,085
But they stand out very clearly in the dawn.

838
00:56:35,594 --> 00:56:37,587
Your life is here.

839
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,929
My life is...there.

840
00:56:43,314 --> 00:56:46,935
We must obey the creeds and codes
that we've sworn our lives to.

841
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,816
kn ow t h at must n ot co m e back

842
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,497
And I know that nothing in this world
can keep me away.

843
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:03,843
FlRST MATE: Up oars!

844
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,836
Down!

845
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,126
Pull, oarsmen!

846
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:36,393
Together!

847
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:52,464
(Wind roars)

848
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:06,240
If I understand you correctly, sir,
our first objective is to recover Malta.

849
00:58:06,325 --> 00:58:10,372
In that case, I suggest we send
the Culloden, the Lion and the Goliath,

850
00:58:10,457 --> 00:58:13,626
under Ball, to blockade the island
and then take possession of it.

851
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:45,632
Aiuto!

852
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:55,195
BO'SUN: Excuse me, sir.

853
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,444
What is it?

854
00:58:56,532 --> 00:59:00,699
We've just picked up a fishing boat
with refugees from Naples

855
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,665
Refugees from Naples?

856
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,994
Yes, sir. They say revolution has broken out.

857
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:09,836
The Government got away, but the King
and Queen are locked up in the palace.

858
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:12,006
I don't understand everything he says sir

859
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:16,314
but there must be plenty of shooting looting
and murdering in the town

860
00:59:21,073 --> 00:59:25,072
That's what you've always said, sir.
Just wait until we've gone. Serves them right.

861
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,785
If they can't help themselves nobody else can

862
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,794
This is Lord Keith's orders
We've got to meet the Alexander

863
00:59:30,879 --> 00:59:33,838
the Foudroyant and the Minotaur
at the point of intersection

864
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:42,016
Blackwood, go back to your ship.

865
00:59:43,108 --> 00:59:46,693
Arrange with Ball to blockade Malta.

866
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,487
The rest of the fleet sails to Messina

867
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:52,415
Well, what course are you taking, sir?

868
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:56,210
Back to Naples.

869
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:01,629
What are you waiting for, Trowbridge?

870
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:03,847
But, sir, Lord Keith's orders...

871
01:00:03,935 --> 01:00:07,436
Lord Keith's orders are addressed to me!
Mine are addressed to you.

872
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:10,148
- Yes, sir.
- Return to your ships at once

873
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,954
HARDY: May I speak sir?

874
01:00:21,546 --> 01:00:22,922
Yes.

875
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:25,581
I'm under your order, sir. I'll do as I'm told.

876
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:29,464
I'll sail this ship anywhere
where there's water under her keel.

877
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,266
But I implore you,
call Blackwood and Trowbridge back,

878
01:00:32,356 --> 01:00:34,266
and send the fleet where it's ordered to

879
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:37,980
And leave our allies the King and Queen
of Naples at the mercy of that rabble?

880
01:00:38,074 --> 01:00:40,115
You know what that mob will do to them.

881
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:43,074
Do you want them to build that bestial guillotine
in Naples?

882
01:00:43,165 --> 01:00:46,501
But in London they will say
it wasn't the Royal Family you went back for.

883
01:00:46,588 --> 01:00:48,878
- Be careful what you say!
- I will say it!

884
01:00:48,967 --> 01:00:50,759
They will say it was for Lady Hamilton.

885
01:00:50,844 --> 01:00:53,516
Let them say it. Let them say what they wish!

886
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,895
l will not see those I love
and owe loyalty to left alone.

887
01:01:01,779 --> 01:01:03,819
Back to Naples

888
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:05,949
I understand, sir.

889
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:26,313
In the face of such open disobedience,
I must ask your Lordships for a clear decision.

890
01:01:26,403 --> 01:01:28,196
Where is Nelson now?

891
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:32,661
At Palermo, where he took the whole party
after he got them away from Naples.

892
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:38,039
As much as I dislike discussing personalities
and private matters,

893
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:42,297
I must say he does not behave in a manner
befitting a British Admiral.

894
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:45,343
Hear, hear.
I quite agree with what you're saying.

895
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:47,221
Gentlemen.

896
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:48,427
Gentlemen.

897
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:51,690
Lord Nelson has some excuse
for his disobedience.

898
01:01:51,777 --> 01:01:54,234
How can there be an excuse for disobedience?

899
01:01:54,323 --> 01:01:59,618
He did save the royal family of an allied nation
from certain death at the hands of the mob.

900
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:02,462
He also saved the British Ambassador
and his wife.

901
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:05,715
- What's the point of saving the husband?
- (Laughter)

902
01:02:07,512 --> 01:02:09,552
Yes, you think it very funny.

903
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:12,596
The whole of England thinks it's funny.
The whole of Europe.

904
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,939
- But it's high time that...
- Steady, Keith. Steady.

905
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:20,073
No-one questions the seriousness of this matter.

906
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:22,780
Lord Nelson is a very gallant sailor.

907
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,908
But not even the greatest hero is strong enough

908
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,337
to defeat the prejudices
and conventions of society.

909
01:02:29,423 --> 01:02:32,379
We must be tolerant of poor Nelson.

910
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:35,044
lt'd be best to bring him home at once.

911
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:40,435
Let him say farewell
to this charming little romance of his.

912
01:02:40,525 --> 01:02:44,192
Let him forget the beautiful Emma.

913
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:57,759
- Oh, that's appalling.
- It's wonderful, magnificent.

914
01:02:57,844 --> 01:03:01,097
- This time we have them at our mercy.
- That's the worst hand we've had.

915
01:03:01,184 --> 01:03:03,474
I know, but we will bluff them. Smile, just smile.

916
01:03:03,562 --> 01:03:05,473
Fortunately, they don't understand us.

917
01:03:05,565 --> 01:03:08,105
- Possiamo cominciare, Signora?
- Qual è la posta?

918
01:03:08,194 --> 01:03:09,570
- Il doppio.
- Il doppio.

919
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:12,693
- But we haven't a chance.
- We shall in a minute. Smile.

920
01:03:12,785 --> 01:03:15,456
- The seven of diamonds.
- The ace of diamonds.

921
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,581
There, you see.

922
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,710
The queen of clubs.

923
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:23,167
- But that's mad...
- Treble the stakes! Triplichiamo la posta.

924
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,883
- But, darling...
- The king of spades.

925
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:29,266
The seven of diamonds.

926
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:31,312
And the ace of hearts.

927
01:03:31,398 --> 01:03:33,441
E bene, signori, a mio parere.

928
01:03:33,528 --> 01:03:36,946
- Molta fortunata, signora.
- Bravissimo, signora.

929
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:40,487
By gad, you're impudent. What would
you have done if the bluff had failed?

930
01:03:40,581 --> 01:03:43,667
I would have fainted and upset the table.
Now let us go.

931
01:03:43,752 --> 01:03:46,708
We can't go. We must give them a chance
to retrieve their losses.

932
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,125
Would they give you a chance? No, come along.

933
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:54,181
I'll order the carriage and we'll drive home
by the sea. The air in here is unbearable.

934
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:56,431
Arrividerci, signori. Bon soir, monsieur.

935
01:03:56,525 --> 01:03:58,185
In a minute.

936
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:08,617
Emma, there's a matter of some importance
that I must speak to you about.

937
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,751
Yes, William.

938
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,711
Ten days ago,
a dispatch came from the Admiralty,

939
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:17,386
instructing Nelson in very definite terms
to report in London at once.

940
01:04:17,474 --> 01:04:19,515
What is all this to do with me?

941
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:23,140
Well, if Nelson ignores this final order,
there can be only one result.

942
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:26,107
Dismissal from the Navy
and the end of his career.

943
01:04:26,198 --> 01:04:30,281
ls it worth it, Emma?
His future is in your hands, you know that.

944
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:37,547
Very well. If we must go back, we must go back.

945
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:41,169
I'll tell him tonight.
When do you wish us to leave?

946
01:04:41,263 --> 01:04:43,304
We are not going to leave, Emma.

947
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:48,021
My instructions from the Admiralty say
that Nelson is to return alone.

948
01:04:48,108 --> 01:04:50,148
Oh, I understand.

949
01:04:50,236 --> 01:04:53,441
The Admiralty is anxious to save him from me.

950
01:04:53,533 --> 01:04:55,778
And what am I expected to do?

951
01:04:55,871 --> 01:05:01,498
It will be convenient, my dear. The Turkish
envoy has invited you to winter in Cairo.

952
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:05,803
Tell Nelson that you love Egypt
and that you have accepted the invitation.

953
01:05:05,888 --> 01:05:09,056
You can be wonderfully convincing
when you try Emma

954
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:14,732
The moment you leave for Egypt he will have
no alternative but to obey orders and return

955
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:19,482
I know I'm asking you to do a very difficult
and painful duty.

956
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:23,790
Thank you, William.

957
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:26,036
Well, we both have our duty, haven't we?

958
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,213
Good luck with yours, my dear.

959
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:59,260
Well, I lost everything. I feel better for it.

960
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:03,730
What is the matter, my dear?

961
01:06:03,816 --> 01:06:05,856
William has just been talking to me.

962
01:06:05,944 --> 01:06:09,445
Telling me of the repeated dispatches
from the Admiralty.

963
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:12,737
He also wanted me to put on
a little performance for you.

964
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:18,339
Act One. Emma Hamilton expresses a sudden
desire to see the Sphinx and the pyramids.

965
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:22,340
Act Two. Lord Nelson pleads,
Emma Hamilton remains adamant.

966
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:25,598
Act Three. Emma Hamilton departs for Egypt.

967
01:06:25,685 --> 01:06:29,980
And Lord Nelson returns to London
a sadder and wiser man.

968
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:35,146
Poor William, he was so serious about it all. I'm
convinced he was only thinking of your career.

969
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:39,372
He'd been puzzling through all sorts of stories.
What hadn't occurred to him was the truth.

970
01:06:39,457 --> 01:06:44,418
How silly. How utterly silly.
To think that we should need lies, you and l.

971
01:06:57,487 --> 01:06:59,280
Oh, my darling.

972
01:06:59,365 --> 01:07:01,406
What is the truth?

973
01:07:01,493 --> 01:07:04,698
Should I have put on that comedy for you?

974
01:07:06,084 --> 01:07:08,837
- It might have helped perhaps.
- Oh, no.

975
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:11,496
I cannot put it off any longer.

976
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,304
I must go back this time.

977
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:18,804
They want me to go alone.

978
01:07:22,153 --> 01:07:24,193
Oh, of course, you must go.

979
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:27,239
And, of course, I must go to Egypt.

980
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:29,866
I don't want to be a burden to you, my darling.

981
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,415
My darling.

982
01:07:33,504 --> 01:07:39,463
And, of course, I will enjoy seeing the pyramids
and the Sphinx and the Nile.

983
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,383
Your Nile.

984
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,096
Oh, my darling.

985
01:07:46,232 --> 01:07:49,104
Why do we always meet just to say goodbye?

986
01:07:53,579 --> 01:08:00,250
? At home I left a lovely maiden

987
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:08,638
? With rosy cheeks and eyes of ocean blue

988
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:17,073
? And though my heart is sad and heavy laden

989
01:08:18,076 --> 01:08:27,835
? To leave a lass I love so fond and true

990
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:29,967
(Bell rings)

991
01:08:31,599 --> 01:08:33,640
What are those bells?

992
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:37,139
Have you forgotten what night this is?

993
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:40,192
The last of 1799.

994
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,612
Eight bells for the old year
and eight for the new.

995
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:48,540
Happy New Year, darling.

996
01:08:48,628 --> 01:08:51,037
apby New Yea r

997
01:08:51,132 --> 01:08:53,172
The dawn of a new century.

998
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,300
1 800.

999
01:08:55,388 --> 01:08:57,927
How strange it sounds.

1000
01:08:59,019 --> 01:09:01,059
What a century it's been.

1001
01:09:03,192 --> 01:09:07,524
Marlborough rode to war
and Washington crossed the Delaware.

1002
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:11,617
Louis XVl and Marie Antoinette.

1003
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:14,951
The last of the Stuarts.

1004
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:17,085
Peter The Great.

1005
01:09:17,173 --> 01:09:19,215
Voltaire.

1006
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:21,343
Clive Of lndia.

1007
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,259
Bonaparte.

1008
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:26,431
Nelson.

1009
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:44,843
Now I've kissed you through two centuries.

1010
01:09:46,054 --> 01:09:48,096
1 800.

1011
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:51,305
The beginning of a new life for me.

1012
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:53,355
A life without you.

1013
01:09:54,818 --> 01:09:57,393
How beautiful was the old century.

1014
01:09:58,616 --> 01:10:00,658
When I was with you.

1015
01:10:08,924 --> 01:10:12,377
Emma, say that you could never leave me.

1016
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:14,512
I can never leave you.

1017
01:10:14,599 --> 01:10:16,844
Say that you hate the blasted pyramids.

1018
01:10:16,938 --> 01:10:18,434
I hate the pyramids.

1019
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:20,483
That you never want to see the Sphinx.

1020
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,444
I never want to see the Sphinx.

1021
01:10:22,531 --> 01:10:24,572
We'll go back to London together.

1022
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,745
I would have died if you'd left me here.

1023
01:10:41,562 --> 01:10:43,602
I am Lady Nelson.

1024
01:10:45,025 --> 01:10:47,268
Everything has been prepared
for Your Ladyship.

1025
01:10:47,362 --> 01:10:49,653
Your rooms have been reserved
by the Admiralty.

1026
01:10:49,742 --> 01:10:51,866
Thank you. Kindly show me to my rooms.

1027
01:10:51,954 --> 01:10:55,788
You will find our bed linen in the green trunk.
We prefer our own sheets.

1028
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,295
- Very good, Your Ladyship.
- Breakfast precisely at 6:45.

1029
01:10:59,382 --> 01:11:03,845
India tea with lemon, one four-minute egg,
two slices of thinly buttered toast.

1030
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:06,175
I shall instruct the head waiter, Your Ladyship.

1031
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:09,474
I dislike waiters in the rooms.
Would you arrange for a chambermaid?

1032
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,606
As you wish...

1033
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:17,820
Here, here. Go and drink a health
to Lord Nelson my son.

1034
01:11:17,913 --> 01:11:20,038
Thank you, sir. I will and be proud to.

1035
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:25,086
I am deeply honoured to have you with us
on this great occasion, sir.

1036
01:11:25,174 --> 01:11:28,296
You are the guest of the British Admiralty,
Mr Nelson.

1037
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:31,842
Good, then charge up a glass of port
to the British Admiralty.

1038
01:11:31,936 --> 01:11:34,855
And let's have it right away.
Anything for you, my dear?

1039
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:39,985
No, thank you. One small glass of light port
for Mr Nelson and a warming pan for his bed.

1040
01:11:40,074 --> 01:11:42,115
Very good, Your Ladyship.

1041
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:45,539
Wonderful! Wonderful! Lap of luxury.

1042
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:48,628
No morning service and no chickens to feed.

1043
01:11:48,713 --> 01:11:51,289
Let's have breakfast in bed with two eggs, eh?

1044
01:11:51,385 --> 01:11:53,261
I've arranged everything, Father.

1045
01:11:53,347 --> 01:11:56,100
It's unwise to break good habits even in London.

1046
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:59,056
You must remember Dr Ponsonby's words
of advice.

1047
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:01,187
Dr Ponsonby's advice.

1048
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,562
Did Dr Ponsonby's son ever sink
the French fleet?

1049
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:07,527
- We're going to enjoy ourselves.
(Knock on door)

1050
01:12:07,618 --> 01:12:11,916
Your Ladyship, Lord Spencer is here
and wishes to be received.

1051
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:14,043
Very well.

1052
01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:28,024
Good morning, Lady Nelson.

1053
01:12:28,112 --> 01:12:31,280
The Admiralty appreciates
your prompt response to its request.

1054
01:12:31,367 --> 01:12:34,038
I hope your accommodation is comfortable.

1055
01:12:34,121 --> 01:12:35,866
Quite, Lord Spencer, thank you.

1056
01:12:35,956 --> 01:12:37,997
- Pray, be seated.
- Thank you.

1057
01:12:38,085 --> 01:12:41,041
I assume that the Admiralty desires
my presence

1058
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:45,002
to discuss the arrangements for my husband's
reception. When does he arrive?

1059
01:12:45,097 --> 01:12:47,769
He's already arrived, Lady Nelson.

1060
01:12:49,062 --> 01:12:50,261
What?

1061
01:12:50,356 --> 01:12:54,688
It was Lord Nelson's special wish
that his arrival should not be made public.

1062
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:57,866
Did he include his wife in the term ''public''?

1063
01:12:57,952 --> 01:13:01,572
I don't recall the exact phraseology of the letter.

1064
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:05,619
However, the Admiralty thought it advisable to
accede to his request.

1065
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,254
So he arrived at Great Yarmouth yesterday

1066
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:11,097
I was not aware
that Great Yarmouth is a naval port.

1067
01:13:11,181 --> 01:13:14,220
He travelled on the mail packet from Hamburg.

1068
01:13:14,312 --> 01:13:15,807
lsn't that peculiar?

1069
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:19,648
I should have supposed that a victorious admiral
would arrive on his flagship.

1070
01:13:19,737 --> 01:13:22,491
Flagship? Oh, er...

1071
01:13:23,661 --> 01:13:28,325
It is not customary as you know
for ladies to travel on battleships

1072
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,915
See.

1073
01:13:33,593 --> 01:13:38,258
I wondered why the Admiralty had decided
not to give my husband an official reception.

1074
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,891
Now I understand and fully agree.

1075
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:45,148
The programme for Lord Nelson's stay
in London will be a simple one.

1076
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:49,025
He should be able to leave for his home
in Norfolk the day after tomorrow,

1077
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,744
even tomorrow night.

1078
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:54,081
Do I understand that my husband will be forced
to resign from the Navy?

1079
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:56,707
Oh, no, no, no, no, Lady Nelson.

1080
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:59,124
Hardly as drastic as that.

1081
01:13:59,218 --> 01:14:04,263
Extended leave for the benefit of his health
will be suggested.

1082
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:06,393
A matter of different words.

1083
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,685
That's what you mean, isn't it? I'm glad.

1084
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:12,270
You were quite right
to spare the people of London.

1085
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:18,206
The indignity of feting a hero who treats
with contempt the most sacred rules of life.

1086
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:22,912
May I say a personal word?

1087
01:14:23,008 --> 01:14:26,296
Try to be forgiving, Lady Nelson.

1088
01:14:26,388 --> 01:14:31,266
Only the weaknesses of the great are glaring.

1089
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:36,067
I prefer the official view.

1090
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,403
Goodbye, Lady Nelson.

1091
01:14:41,497 --> 01:14:43,537
(Cheering outside)

1092
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:45,250
Did you hear it? Cheering.

1093
01:14:45,336 --> 01:14:48,089
Listen. He's coming! He's coming!

1094
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:53,005
Excuse me, sir. May I have your permission
to hang a flag in the balcony?

1095
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:56,186
Hang two flags, three flags,
everything you've got.

1096
01:14:56,271 --> 01:15:00,520
Come on! Come on!
Hang the coat of arms between the flags!

1097
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:05,691
Most opportune, sir. We saved the coat of arms
from King George's jubilee!

1098
01:15:05,785 --> 01:15:08,788
Do you realise
that these are my private rooms, sir?

1099
01:15:08,873 --> 01:15:11,912
Forgive me, Your Ladyship.
I had no idea this would happen.

1100
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:16,420
The Admiralty told me that Lord Nelson's return
would be private and without demonstration.

1101
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,381
We never dreamed that the public would
take the matter so completely in hand.

1102
01:15:20,476 --> 01:15:23,480
Has the government no control
over this vulgar demonstration?

1103
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:27,019
No, ma'am. The vulgar demonstration
has control over the government.

1104
01:15:27,112 --> 01:15:29,153
MR NELSON: Bravo for Nelson! Bravo!

1105
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:33,823
I must get back to the Admiralty,
hang out all the flags we've got.

1106
01:15:33,915 --> 01:15:35,576
Listen, church bells.

1107
01:15:35,668 --> 01:15:38,589
Victory bells for my son.

1108
01:15:41,344 --> 01:15:43,385
Here they are!

1109
01:15:43,473 --> 01:15:45,513
(Cheering continues)

1110
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:52,811
Mr Nelson, my name is Hamilton.

1111
01:15:52,904 --> 01:15:56,407
Oh, my son's good friend.
He's often told me about you in his letters.

1112
01:15:56,494 --> 01:15:59,117
You're to be congratulated.
You have a great son.

1113
01:15:59,207 --> 01:16:02,209
Lady Nelson, I am delighted to meet you.

1114
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:06,674
We had the privilege of joining your husband
in his triumphant procession across Europe.

1115
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,513
It was overwhelming and quite exhausting,
I'm afraid, for an old man.

1116
01:16:10,602 --> 01:16:15,350
My wife was in her element. She swallows
a triumph like a penguin swallows a herring.

1117
01:16:15,443 --> 01:16:17,435
Did you have a good crossing, Sir William?

1118
01:16:17,528 --> 01:16:21,148
Quite rough, I'm afraid. Everyone was seasick
and I was sicker than them all.

1119
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:24,198
I made the mistake of trying
to ward it off with pills.

1120
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,910
- Oh dear dear
- What's the good of trying to fight the elements?

1121
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:30,461
It's far more sensible, is it not, Lady Nelson,

1122
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,007
and so much easier to accept their victory

1123
01:16:33,095 --> 01:16:37,143
whether those elements be around us
or within us

1124
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:42,223
I hope we shall have the pleasure
of seeing your frequently, Lady Nelson.

1125
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,525
He's coming! Nelson! Nelson!

1126
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:47,658
Bravo for Nelson!

1127
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,116
My boy!

1128
01:16:51,918 --> 01:16:55,335
How proud your mother would be
if she could see you this day.

1129
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,630
How have you been all these years, Father?

1130
01:16:57,718 --> 01:17:00,508
First rate. Fanny's taken great care of me.

1131
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:05,599
I'm sure she has.

1132
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,445
There is so much I have to be grateful to you for.

1133
01:17:12,744 --> 01:17:14,785
How are you, my dear?

1134
01:17:14,873 --> 01:17:16,701
I'm very well.

1135
01:17:22,928 --> 01:17:24,589
And how is Burnham Thorpe?

1136
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,389
They've named a street after us.

1137
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,934
What an honour.

1138
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,511
(Laughs)
EMMA: Are these Lord Nelson's rooms?

1139
01:17:30,607 --> 01:17:32,350
Yes milady

1140
01:17:32,442 --> 01:17:36,229
It was magnificent, stupendous.
Wasn't it wonderful, William?

1141
01:17:36,324 --> 01:17:40,372
They're wild with enthusiasm.
Come to the balcony! Quickly Quickly!

1142
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:42,830
(Band plays)? For He's A Jolly Good Fellow

1143
01:17:55,897 --> 01:17:58,271
CROWD:? For he's a jolly good fellow

1144
01:17:58,359 --> 01:18:01,149
? For he's a jolly good fellow

1145
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,113
? For he's a jolly good fellow

1146
01:18:04,204 --> 01:18:06,115
? And so say all of us

1147
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,540
? And so say all of us

1148
01:18:09,044 --> 01:18:11,584
? And so say all of us

1149
01:18:11,673 --> 01:18:14,248
? For he's a jolly good fellow

1150
01:18:14,344 --> 01:18:16,551
? And so say all of us

1151
01:18:17,057 --> 01:18:19,218
? And so say all of us

1152
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:22,400
? And so say all of us

1153
01:18:22,483 --> 01:18:25,106
? For he's a jolly good fellow

1154
01:18:25,196 --> 01:18:26,441
Lady Nelson...

1155
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:28,156
? And so say all of us

1156
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:29,867
I am Emma Hamilton.

1157
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:34,001
CROWD: Hooray! Hip hip hooray!

1158
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,547
Hip hip hooray!

1159
01:18:36,048 --> 01:18:38,623
Hip hip hooray!

1160
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:41,593
Hip hip hooray!

1161
01:18:54,703 --> 01:18:56,743
Well, it's been a great day.

1162
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:58,741
A wonderful day.

1163
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:02,287
And next month,
it's the choirboys' picnic at Burnham Thorpe.

1164
01:19:02,381 --> 01:19:05,503
(Laughs)
LADY NELSON: Why do you laugh?

1165
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:08,552
Are the places of country people
of so small account?

1166
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:12,595
A little more wholesome I think
than the mass hysteria we've seen today

1167
01:19:12,691 --> 01:19:16,109
Well, call it what you like.
It was a beautiful reception.

1168
01:19:16,197 --> 01:19:20,493
MOTHER: You wouldn't believe the fuss
they made about him at Naples after the battle

1169
01:19:20,578 --> 01:19:24,163
Whoo! Such crowds. Thousands of Italians.

1170
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,707
All smelling of different sorts of onions.

1171
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,837
MR NELSON: Onions?

1172
01:19:28,924 --> 01:19:33,923
Yes, they always do. I don't know why,
it comes out more when they get excited.

1173
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:37,470
There was such a crowd round the embassy
the milkman couldn't get in

1174
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:40,354
So His Lordship had to go
without his macaroni pudding.

1175
01:19:40,445 --> 01:19:41,904
LADY NELSON: His what?

1176
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:47,412
My Emma put him on macaroni pudding
to fatten him up after the battle.

1177
01:19:47,497 --> 01:19:50,287
Did you ever meet the King of Naples,
Mrs Nelson?

1178
01:19:51,379 --> 01:19:53,419
He was a one for macaroni.

1179
01:19:53,507 --> 01:19:57,175
He'd take pieces that length,
open his gullet and drop it in.

1180
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:59,256
Proper caution, he was

1181
01:19:59,349 --> 01:20:02,519
He came to see Emma with the Queen one day
and he pinched my...

1182
01:20:02,605 --> 01:20:04,100
He pinched me.

1183
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:06,315
He pinched you? The King?

1184
01:20:06,403 --> 01:20:09,110
Well, you see, he's a foreigner, poor King.

1185
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:14,874
He got so jealous when they cheered
His Lordship because he loved it so himself.

1186
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:20,749
If you shouted outside his palace,
he'd come in and out like a cuckoo clock.

1187
01:20:20,843 --> 01:20:25,057
Emma... Emma, who was that other king
we met on the way home?

1188
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:28,348
You know,
I get so mixed up with all these monarchs.

1189
01:20:30,777 --> 01:20:33,983
Oh, dear, Emma. Will you excuse me, dear?
I've been up since five.

1190
01:20:34,074 --> 01:20:36,744
Of course, Mother, darling. Good night.

1191
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:41,159
Oh, it's good to be back in England again
to hear the Bow Bells and the muffin men

1192
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:43,494
and the soot falling down your chimney.

1193
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,630
(Mother laughs)

1194
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:55,689
MR NELSON: Well Sir William
how goes the world these days?

1195
01:20:55,775 --> 01:20:58,184
Can we hope for a little peace now?

1196
01:20:58,279 --> 01:20:59,904
Well, I don't know.

1197
01:20:59,991 --> 01:21:02,780
What was that medicine you gave my husband?

1198
01:21:02,871 --> 01:21:06,788
It's some stuff my mother makes.
It's very good for coughs and colds.

1199
01:21:06,878 --> 01:21:09,667
I think I would prefer my husband
to see a doctor.

1200
01:21:10,759 --> 01:21:12,799
This weather is dreadful for him.

1201
01:21:12,886 --> 01:21:16,721
It was so different in Italy.
The sun always seemed to shine there.

1202
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:20,346
Yes, it's never very agreeable
in the Thames Valley during the winter.

1203
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:24,655
It's only for a few days. Once he's back
in Norfolk, he'll be a different man.

1204
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:27,314
Do you think
you will be leaving London so soon?

1205
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:29,785
Certainly. There's nothing to detain us.

1206
01:21:29,873 --> 01:21:34,337
Directly he's made his report to the Admiralty
and taken his seat in the House of Lords,

1207
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:35,834
we shall be free to go.

1208
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:37,468
Why not?

1209
01:21:37,553 --> 01:21:39,593
Oh...of course, yes.

1210
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:41,722
What are your plans, Lady Hamilton?

1211
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,433
I suppose you'll be going abroad again shortly?

1212
01:21:44,522 --> 01:21:48,570
We don't really know.
Life is so very uncertain, isn't it?

1213
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,694
I haven't found it so.

1214
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:56,326
Will you excuse me, Lady Hamilton?
It's been a very exhausting day.

1215
01:21:56,415 --> 01:21:58,576
- Of course. Good night.
- Good night.

1216
01:22:12,735 --> 01:22:14,194
Emma.

1217
01:22:16,992 --> 01:22:19,033
We've been living in a dream.

1218
01:22:20,122 --> 01:22:23,790
And now we are faced with the truth,
how ugly it is.

1219
01:22:23,879 --> 01:22:25,374
How terribly ugly.

1220
01:22:25,464 --> 01:22:27,790
But we've still got the courage to face it.

1221
01:22:27,884 --> 01:22:30,460
What's the good of being courageous
if you're trapped?

1222
01:22:30,555 --> 01:22:32,929
If you know you are wrong
and there's no way out.

1223
01:22:34,645 --> 01:22:38,729
I'll go to her and talk to her. Tonight. At once.

1224
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,359
And you must talk to William.

1225
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:43,490
They must understand

1226
01:22:43,577 --> 01:22:45,618
- Divorce?
- There is no other way

1227
01:22:45,705 --> 01:22:47,331
No, m y ove

1228
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:50,704
That might be well enough for other people,
but not for you.

1229
01:22:50,796 --> 01:22:55,178
You are not an ordinary man and you cannot
behave like a Mr Jones or a Mr Thompson.

1230
01:22:55,264 --> 01:22:57,304
I wish I were a Mr Thompson.

1231
01:22:57,393 --> 01:23:01,309
Now, for the first time,
I begin to understand what William meant.

1232
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,807
What we're doing is so dreadfully wrong.

1233
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:06,524
Of course, I should have realised it before.

1234
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,701
And because it is wrong,
it cannot bring happiness.

1235
01:23:11,623 --> 01:23:13,664
Those streets we came along today.

1236
01:23:13,752 --> 01:23:18,831
They're the very same streets I walked through
when I was a kitchen maid looking for work,

1237
01:23:18,926 --> 01:23:21,680
but, today, they were the scene of your triumph,

1238
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:24,802
the triumph of our greatest man
coming to his home.

1239
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:29,601
They have made you the symbol
of all that is most precious to them.

1240
01:23:29,695 --> 01:23:32,366
Whatever you do
will be their guide and example.

1241
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:34,693
You will not speak to your wife

1242
01:23:34,787 --> 01:23:37,196
and I shall not speak to William.

1243
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:39,664
(Clock chimes)

1244
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:45,294
I'm cold!

1245
01:23:45,386 --> 01:23:47,546
I'm freezing. I'm frightened!

1246
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,311
Emma! Somebody will hear you.

1247
01:23:50,395 --> 01:23:52,435
Ssh, Emma!

1248
01:23:52,523 --> 01:23:54,351
Dear, Emma, ssh!

1249
01:23:55,444 --> 01:23:59,148
(Whispers) Is this better?
Lowered voices? Stolen meetings?

1250
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:02,916
Darkness, suspicion, lies, more lies?

1251
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:06,459
Is this what has become of it?

1252
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:08,588
All that beauty

1253
01:24:08,675 --> 01:24:10,918
and light and glory?

1254
01:24:14,852 --> 01:24:17,094
Good night, my dearest love.

1255
01:24:21,737 --> 01:24:23,362
Good night.

1256
01:24:27,372 --> 01:24:29,414
(Sobs)

1257
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:37,760
(Clock chimes)

1258
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:42,767
I, my lords,

1259
01:24:42,855 --> 01:24:45,646
have, in different countries,

1260
01:24:45,736 --> 01:24:48,822
seen much of the miseries of war.

1261
01:24:49,993 --> 01:24:52,034
I am, therefore,

1262
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:54,161
in my innermost soul...

1263
01:24:55,293 --> 01:24:57,333
..a man of peace.

1264
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:02,971
Yet I would not, for the sake of any peace,

1265
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,465
however fortunate,

1266
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,099
consent to sacrifice

1267
01:25:08,189 --> 01:25:11,892
one jot of England's honour.

1268
01:25:11,987 --> 01:25:13,814
Hitherto

1269
01:25:13,906 --> 01:25:17,954
there has been nothing greater known
on the continent

1270
01:25:18,038 --> 01:25:20,079
than the faith

1271
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,541
the untainted honour

1272
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:26,132
the generous public sympathies

1273
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:28,794
the high diplomatic influence,

1274
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,930
the commerce,

1275
01:25:31,017 --> 01:25:33,058
the grandeur,

1276
01:25:33,146 --> 01:25:35,187
the irresistible power,

1277
01:25:35,275 --> 01:25:38,776
the unconquerable valour of the British nation.

1278
01:25:38,864 --> 01:25:40,905
(Murmurs of agreement)

1279
01:25:42,078 --> 01:25:45,579
He's nervous.
Look. Look at his hand. He's trembling.

1280
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:50,332
It's nerve-racking for any man
to come into the House of Lords for the first time.

1281
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:54,046
It will be more nerve-racking
for the poor man when he goes out.

1282
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,967
Why?

1283
01:25:56,059 --> 01:25:58,101
There is that Hamilton woman.

1284
01:25:58,189 --> 01:26:01,773
peace or war no interest

1285
01:26:02,946 --> 01:26:05,403
And, don't look now, his wife.

1286
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:10,623
and as the nation was pleased
with the sincere spirit of peace

1287
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:14,754
It will be a thrilling moment
when he goes into the vestibule.

1288
01:26:14,839 --> 01:26:18,175
I can hardly wait
to see which one he goes to first.

1289
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:19,887
Her?

1290
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:22,014
Or her?

1291
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:38,168
Here he comes.

1292
01:27:00,498 --> 01:27:02,575
My dear, were you comfortable up there?

1293
01:27:02,668 --> 01:27:04,792
Sufficiently, Horatio. Sufficiently.

1294
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,419
- Did you hear my speech?
- For the most part.

1295
01:27:07,509 --> 01:27:11,011
You have a way of overemphasising,
which is rather embarrassing.

1296
01:27:11,099 --> 01:27:13,140
- Oh.
- It was quite interesting.

1297
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,723
Lady Keith.

1298
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,308
Lady Spencer.

1299
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,025
Lady Hamilton.

1300
01:27:24,829 --> 01:27:26,870
WOMAN: Why, what's the matter?

1301
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:30,460
GENTLEMAN: Stand back please! Give her air!
- What was that?

1302
01:27:30,548 --> 01:27:32,755
- It's Lady Hamilton!
- Stand back please!

1303
01:27:32,843 --> 01:27:34,967
Wait, Frances, please.

1304
01:27:35,054 --> 01:27:37,297
- Will you fetch a doctor?
- Immediately.

1305
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:40,347
Make way, please

1306
01:27:40,438 --> 01:27:42,646
- What's happened?
- I told her not to come.

1307
01:27:42,734 --> 01:27:44,562
She's not been feeling well all day.

1308
01:27:44,653 --> 01:27:46,564
N SO N W here s the doctor?

1309
01:27:46,656 --> 01:27:48,484
But why should she faint?

1310
01:27:48,576 --> 01:27:51,367
My dear, it's natural to women of all classes.

1311
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:53,083
Drive on!

1312
01:27:56,048 --> 01:27:57,459
(Door opens)

1313
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:58,749
Well?

1314
01:27:58,844 --> 01:28:03,259
Frances, how could you drive away like that,
without making the slightest effort to help?

1315
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,558
Did you expect me to take her into my carriage,

1316
01:28:05,645 --> 01:28:08,768
just because she selects the House of Lords
for her melodrama?

1317
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:12,906
When people have been kind to me and
generous, don't ignore them when they're ill.

1318
01:28:12,991 --> 01:28:15,365
- Even in the House of Lords.
- Generous? Ha ha!

1319
01:28:15,454 --> 01:28:18,077
It is well known that what success
I may have achieved

1320
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:21,503
has been largely due
to the help I have received from the Hamiltons.

1321
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:24,046
- Why are you so ungrateful?
- Why are you so blind?

1322
01:28:24,135 --> 01:28:26,176
Don't you see what that woman is after?

1323
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:30,346
It's the oldest story in the world,
the most sordid and the most contemptible.

1324
01:28:30,437 --> 01:28:34,568
Find a public hero and there you'll find,
as sure as fate, a woman parasite.

1325
01:28:34,653 --> 01:28:38,105
Don't you realise that all she wants
is to flutter about in your glory,

1326
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:40,323
to use you for her own ambition and conceit?

1327
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:42,903
Oh, I know, she helped you,
she encouraged you.

1328
01:28:42,998 --> 01:28:45,705
Why, it was part of her plan
to play upon your vanity.

1329
01:28:45,795 --> 01:28:48,418
She's capable of declaring you
the father of her child.

1330
01:28:48,508 --> 01:28:50,550
- Frances, control yourself!
- Why not?

1331
01:28:50,637 --> 01:28:52,964
Even that accusation stirs some men's vanities.

1332
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:54,054
Silence!

1333
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:56,717
Oh, yes, everyone says
she's a wonderful actress.

1334
01:28:56,813 --> 01:29:00,231
She is brilliant, to have hidden
her sweet secret for so long.

1335
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,652
The other day, you remarked upon
the new fashions, all these frills and folds.

1336
01:29:04,744 --> 01:29:07,830
She invented them and all society followed.

1337
01:29:07,915 --> 01:29:11,203
Wonderful to lead society into helping her
through a predicament.

1338
01:29:11,296 --> 01:29:15,294
You fool! Don't you realise everything she does
is calculated and cold-blooded?

1339
01:29:15,384 --> 01:29:17,842
She faints in the House of Lords,
a perfect place.

1340
01:29:17,931 --> 01:29:21,303
Do you suppose she'd have wasted time
in fainting in her own bedroom?

1341
01:29:21,396 --> 01:29:23,224
You poor silly man!

1342
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,562
Poor and silly?

1343
01:29:27,656 --> 01:29:29,982
Yes, that is what I am without her.

1344
01:29:30,076 --> 01:29:32,568
I'm a peer of England because of her.

1345
01:29:32,663 --> 01:29:35,202
And because of her, I'm Lady Nelson.

1346
01:29:36,295 --> 01:29:38,538
Lady Nelson? Ha!

1347
01:29:38,632 --> 01:29:40,673
What an honour!

1348
01:29:40,761 --> 01:29:45,259
They point after my coach, point up
at my windows, point at me in the streets.

1349
01:29:45,351 --> 01:29:47,927
There's a coarse joke about me in the taverns.

1350
01:29:48,023 --> 01:29:50,561
A foul song about me on the Limehouse barges.

1351
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,480
Lady Nelson!

1352
01:29:52,571 --> 01:29:54,197
How funny!

1353
01:29:54,282 --> 01:29:56,110
How pitiful!

1354
01:29:57,203 --> 01:29:59,245
And how proud I might have been.

1355
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:02,869
I'm sorry, Frances.

1356
01:30:04,173 --> 01:30:05,799
Sorry?

1357
01:30:05,884 --> 01:30:07,926
Is that all you have to give me?

1358
01:30:09,098 --> 01:30:11,769
Yes. That is all.

1359
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:13,680
Very well.

1360
01:30:13,772 --> 01:30:17,477
I shall take that as your answer
and now you shall have mine.

1361
01:30:17,572 --> 01:30:19,399
I shall go away,

1362
01:30:19,491 --> 01:30:23,622
but I shall never drag the name of Nelson
through the divorce court.

1363
01:30:23,707 --> 01:30:26,245
As long as I live, I shall be your wife.

1364
01:30:26,335 --> 01:30:27,960
Goodbye.

1365
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:41,391
Horatio, call her back.

1366
01:30:41,485 --> 01:30:44,191
I implore you, call her back.

1367
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:46,821
You mustn't let her go like this.

1368
01:30:48,455 --> 01:30:51,077
I couldn't help hearing what you said, Horatio.

1369
01:30:51,167 --> 01:30:52,792
Please, Father,

1370
01:30:52,878 --> 01:30:54,920
try to understand.

1371
01:30:55,007 --> 01:30:57,049
do, m y boy, do

1372
01:30:57,136 --> 01:31:01,599
I know I'm a silly old man, a humble
country parson, and I don't know the world,

1373
01:31:01,685 --> 01:31:05,102
except the little people who come to me with
their little troubles,

1374
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:09,770
but even those little people sometimes
have to fight in the depths of their soul,

1375
01:31:09,863 --> 01:31:13,781
the same temptations as you,
the great of the world.

1376
01:31:13,871 --> 01:31:17,207
And, when they have to choose
between right and wrong,

1377
01:31:17,294 --> 01:31:20,296
I give them the same advice
as I give to you now.

1378
01:31:20,382 --> 01:31:25,177
Even if it forces all three of us
to live in misery for the rest of our lives?

1379
01:31:25,264 --> 01:31:27,092
Even so.

1380
01:31:28,186 --> 01:31:30,347
That is something I cannot do, Father.

1381
01:31:32,235 --> 01:31:34,276
Then I shall go with her, Horatio.

1382
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,910
What s the name off the child?

1383
01:31:40,997 --> 01:31:43,038
Horatia Thompson.

1384
01:31:44,547 --> 01:31:46,587
Her father's name?

1385
01:31:46,675 --> 01:31:48,716
Horatio Thompson.

1386
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,803
- Profession?
- Sailor.

1387
01:31:57,985 --> 01:31:59,812
Where is he now?

1388
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,530
At sea.

1389
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,920
(Running footsteps)

1390
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:16,260
- Emily!
- Mother, darling!

1391
01:32:16,349 --> 01:32:18,473
- Are you well?
- Yes. How's the baby?

1392
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,311
I wish you could see her. She's an angel.
Not at all like a child of two months.

1393
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,060
She's like a little princess.

1394
01:32:24,152 --> 01:32:28,449
I wish you could see the way she receives
her bottle and then indicates the meal is over.

1395
01:32:28,535 --> 01:32:30,908
- You'd adore her.
- What does she weigh now?

1396
01:32:30,997 --> 01:32:33,205
9lb 4oz, before her second bottle.

1397
01:32:33,293 --> 01:32:35,370
- The news, isn't it splendid?
- What news?

1398
01:32:35,463 --> 01:32:37,836
- Haven't you heard?
- I haven't been out

1399
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:42,340
He's done it again. He's beaten the Danes.
It's a glorious victory!

1400
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:45,602
Nelson was in the front line of battle,
ahead of the main fleet.

1401
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:49,440
His commander in chief saw the enemy
outnumbered us by more than two to one.

1402
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:52,816
He sent off a signal to Nelson
telling him to give up and withdraw.

1403
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:56,742
Do you know what Nelson did?
When the signal was pointed out to him,

1404
01:32:56,831 --> 01:33:01,828
he put a telescope to his blind eye, said, ''I'm
darned if I can see it'', went on fighting and won.

1405
01:33:01,922 --> 01:33:07,217
There, you see, everything comes in handy,
if you know how to use it, even a blind eye!

1406
01:33:07,307 --> 01:33:09,347
(Both giggle)

1407
01:33:10,437 --> 01:33:12,645
How's William, Mother?

1408
01:33:12,733 --> 01:33:16,483
I have some news, too, Emma,
but not so good as yours.

1409
01:33:16,572 --> 01:33:21,737
All his treasures, pictures, everything, he's
waited for them to come from Naples for so long.

1410
01:33:21,832 --> 01:33:26,377
Now, we know for certain they all went down
in the ship that was lost in the storm.

1411
01:33:26,464 --> 01:33:29,834
Oh, poor William. That was his whole life.

1412
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:32,637
Gavin,

1413
01:33:32,722 --> 01:33:34,763
that picture, there,

1414
01:33:34,851 --> 01:33:36,725
the Van Dyck.

1415
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:38,853
It's crooked, don't you see?

1416
01:33:39,944 --> 01:33:42,069
I've told you about it twice already.

1417
01:33:42,156 --> 01:33:45,112
- Why don't you put it straight?
- Yes, Sir William.

1418
01:33:51,838 --> 01:33:53,879
- Here, sir?
- Yes.

1419
01:33:55,594 --> 01:33:57,220
That's good.

1420
01:33:57,305 --> 01:33:58,932
Good, Gavin.

1421
01:34:00,019 --> 01:34:02,807
It's good to have my pictures
around me once more

1422
01:34:02,898 --> 01:34:04,939
and my statues.

1423
01:34:05,026 --> 01:34:08,443
But they... They need more light, more room.

1424
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:10,859
We must rearrange them, Gavin.

1425
01:34:16,879 --> 01:34:18,707
Gavin...

1426
01:34:18,799 --> 01:34:21,671
I'll dine with Miss Hart tonight.

1427
01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:23,387
Alone.

1428
01:34:23,473 --> 01:34:25,514
At eight o'clock.

1429
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,946
Look after yourself.
Talk to Sir William before it's too late.

1430
01:34:34,031 --> 01:34:37,653
Or the house itseIf will go to his nephew
instead of to his wife.

1431
01:34:37,746 --> 01:34:40,619
His wife?
Why, I have never been his wife, Mother.

1432
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:42,752
Let Charles have the money.

1433
01:34:42,839 --> 01:34:45,212
I don't want it and I don't deserve it.

1434
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:50,642
But, my darling, if things stay as they are,
you won't have a penny when he dies.

1435
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:52,766
You'll be poor!

1436
01:34:52,855 --> 01:34:54,895
I shall be rich.

1437
01:34:54,983 --> 01:34:57,856
I've got my child, his child.

1438
01:34:57,947 --> 01:35:01,364
I think that means more
than all the money in the world.

1439
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:09,416
- Can I see Sir William now, Gavin?
- I don't think it's advisable, milady.

1440
01:35:09,507 --> 01:35:12,380
He's sleeping, very peacefully.

1441
01:35:26,784 --> 01:35:29,657
Gentlemen, the victor of Copenhagen!

1442
01:35:29,749 --> 01:35:31,789
ALL: Bravo, Nelson!

1443
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:44,055
Lord Nelson, your decisive defeat of the Danes
has made it possible for the British Government

1444
01:35:44,147 --> 01:35:49,193
to negotiate this honourable
and, I must say, unexpected peace with France.

1445
01:35:49,281 --> 01:35:52,984
We all believe, with the deepest conviction,

1446
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:55,915
that we shall have, at last, peace.

1447
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,039
ALL: Hear, hear!

1448
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:01,713
Lord Spencer,

1449
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,426
gentlemen...

1450
01:36:04,596 --> 01:36:09,227
..you are celebrating a peace
with Napoleon Bonaparte.

1451
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:12,940
''Peace'' is a very beautiful word,

1452
01:36:13,028 --> 01:36:15,485
as long as the impulse of peace is behind it,

1453
01:36:15,573 --> 01:36:18,113
but you will never make peace with Napoleon.

1454
01:36:18,203 --> 01:36:20,244
He doesn't mean peace, today.

1455
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:23,659
He just wants to gain a little time...

1456
01:36:24,755 --> 01:36:26,796
..to rearm himseIf at sea

1457
01:36:26,884 --> 01:36:30,586
and make new alliances with Italy and Spain,
all to one purpose.

1458
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:33,304
To destroy our empire!

1459
01:36:33,394 --> 01:36:36,681
Years ago, I said the same thing at Naples.

1460
01:36:36,774 --> 01:36:41,523
I begged them, entreated them, not to give way,
but they wouldn't listen to me and paid the price.

1461
01:36:41,616 --> 01:36:46,577
That was a little kingdom,
miles away in the Mediterranean.

1462
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:51,589
But now it is England, our own land.

1463
01:36:52,676 --> 01:36:56,177
Napoleon can never be master of the world
until he has smashed us up

1464
01:36:56,265 --> 01:36:59,600
and, believe me, gentlemen,
he means to be master of the world!

1465
01:36:59,687 --> 01:37:01,846
You cannot make peace with dictators.

1466
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:04,314
You have to destroy them, wipe them out!

1467
01:37:04,403 --> 01:37:08,452
Gentlemen, I implore you,
speak to the Prime Minister before it is too late!

1468
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,577
Do not ratify this peace!

1469
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:14,584
We, er, appreciate all you say.

1470
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:19,049
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
I feIt it my duty to tell you of these things.

1471
01:37:19,135 --> 01:37:21,593
I'm not a statesman, of course.

1472
01:37:21,681 --> 01:37:23,723
I'm no diplomat.

1473
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:26,100
I must leave it in your hands.

1474
01:37:26,189 --> 01:37:28,266
- Gentlemen.
- Good day, Lord Nelson.

1475
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:31,401
(Heated discussion)

1476
01:37:31,489 --> 01:37:34,942
Going to your, er, home in Norfolk, Nelson?

1477
01:37:35,036 --> 01:37:37,077
I don't... I don't think so.

1478
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:41,457
My wife tells me
she saw Lady Nelson at Bath, recently.

1479
01:37:41,549 --> 01:37:43,589
Yes. She's very well.

1480
01:37:43,677 --> 01:37:46,216
She gives her time to social work.

1481
01:37:46,306 --> 01:37:49,177
Ah. And er...shall you go to Venice?

1482
01:37:50,269 --> 01:37:52,310
Er... Why Venice?

1483
01:37:52,397 --> 01:37:54,891
Oh, something I heard the other day.

1484
01:37:54,986 --> 01:37:59,984
A little party to some musical festival,
Lady Hamilton and a few English friends.

1485
01:38:01,121 --> 01:38:03,162
Where did you hear this?

1486
01:38:03,249 --> 01:38:07,380
It was that little musical chap,
who came over to Covent Garden to conduct.

1487
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:11,133
I heard him say something about
Lady Hamilton going back with him

1488
01:38:11,222 --> 01:38:12,847
Oh, well...

1489
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:15,176
I daresay I've got it all mixed up.

1490
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:17,597
Well, it's good to see you home again.

1491
01:38:19,986 --> 01:38:22,026
Why, your lordship!

1492
01:38:22,114 --> 01:38:24,155
Good afternoon, Mrs Cadogan.

1493
01:38:24,242 --> 01:38:26,116
Sit down, please.

1494
01:38:26,203 --> 01:38:28,244
Everything is in such a mess.

1495
01:38:28,332 --> 01:38:31,251
Why this sudden move
from Piccadilly to Nero's Hotel?

1496
01:38:31,336 --> 01:38:37,760
Well, you see, everything was so dull and dismal
since William died.

1497
01:38:37,848 --> 01:38:39,889
Emma couldn't stand it any longer.

1498
01:38:39,976 --> 01:38:41,970
see

1499
01:38:42,063 --> 01:38:43,523
Where is she now?

1500
01:38:43,608 --> 01:38:45,649
She went out quite early.

1501
01:38:45,736 --> 01:38:50,614
With the little foreign musical gentleman.
They're... They're driving in the park.

1502
01:38:50,702 --> 01:38:51,901
Oh.

1503
01:38:51,996 --> 01:38:54,370
May wat?
Yes please.

1504
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:57,033
Look at the flowers. Aren't they pretty?

1505
01:38:57,129 --> 01:38:59,670
So nice for a young widow.

1506
01:38:59,759 --> 01:39:01,799
- Yes.
EMMA: Horatio

1507
01:39:01,887 --> 01:39:03,881
I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?

1508
01:39:03,974 --> 01:39:05,683
Oh, no.

1509
01:39:05,769 --> 01:39:08,439
Emma, dear. I just came in by chance.

1510
01:39:08,523 --> 01:39:12,393
Your mother has been telling me
why you moved from Piccadilly.

1511
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,113
I think you're quite right.

1512
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:16,241
It was so very gloomy there.

1513
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:20,783
I haven't seen a great deal of you
since I've been back, Emma.

1514
01:39:20,877 --> 01:39:24,378
- You know what it's like. There's so much to do.
- How is the child?

1515
01:39:24,465 --> 01:39:27,088
I've been meaning every day this week
to go and see her.

1516
01:39:27,178 --> 01:39:29,469
But it's so difficult. It takes almost a whole day.

1517
01:39:29,558 --> 01:39:32,431
Emma, let us drive out
and see her this afternoon.

1518
01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:34,101
Oh, yes.

1519
01:39:34,192 --> 01:39:38,061
Lord Nelson, whom the whole of London knows,
calling on little Horatia Thompson.

1520
01:39:38,156 --> 01:39:40,195
whose father no-one has as yet seen.

1521
01:39:40,283 --> 01:39:43,120
My dear, what a titbit
for Lady Spencer's next dinner party.

1522
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:44,319
(Knocking)

1523
01:39:44,414 --> 01:39:46,207
Come in.

1524
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:50,125
Thank you.

1525
01:39:57,436 --> 01:40:01,139
My dear, I know you're very busy
and I don't want to intrude upon your affairs,

1526
01:40:01,233 --> 01:40:04,523
but there are things that I don't quite understand
since I came back

1527
01:40:04,616 --> 01:40:06,409
and to be honest I don't quite like

1528
01:40:06,494 --> 01:40:07,740
What things do you mean?

1529
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:09,740
Three times this week I've tried to see you

1530
01:40:09,833 --> 01:40:13,168
and each time you've had appointments
with people whom I don't know.

1531
01:40:14,674 --> 01:40:16,713
We had no secrets at one time.

1532
01:40:17,927 --> 01:40:19,303
Even in our letters.

1533
01:40:20,516 --> 01:40:23,222
You surely do not ask to see all my letters.

1534
01:40:24,438 --> 01:40:26,813
Certainly I do not ask to see them, my dear.

1535
01:40:27,903 --> 01:40:29,695
If you want to hide them from me.

1536
01:40:30,782 --> 01:40:32,112
You're jealous!

1537
01:40:32,202 --> 01:40:33,662
Why do you make fun of me?

1538
01:40:33,746 --> 01:40:36,204
Fun? I've never been so happy in all my life.

1539
01:40:36,293 --> 01:40:38,120
You're splendid when you're jealous.

1540
01:40:38,212 --> 01:40:40,751
You must promise me to be jealous always,
please.

1541
01:40:42,343 --> 01:40:45,051
We were talking about some letters, weren't we?

1542
01:40:47,435 --> 01:40:54,106
Horatio, if there are certain letters I would
sooner keep to myself, won't you trust me?

1543
01:40:56,032 --> 01:40:57,860
What are those letters?

1544
01:41:00,498 --> 01:41:01,780
Very well.

1545
01:41:07,009 --> 01:41:09,050
Read them.

1546
01:41:16,524 --> 01:41:18,565
(She plays)

1547
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,784
I'm sorry.

1548
01:41:23,871 --> 01:41:25,911
Forgive me.

1549
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:29,365
- I'll see you later.
-No, Horatio, don't go.

1550
01:41:30,923 --> 01:41:33,878
You know what will happen
if you leave them unopened.

1551
01:41:33,969 --> 01:41:36,544
We shall never quite understand each other
again.

1552
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,216
They're quite short, and to the point.

1553
01:41:39,312 --> 01:41:41,353
Bills, bills, and more bills.

1554
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:45,061
Threats, summonses and lawsuits.
I'm up to my neck in them - drowned in them.

1555
01:41:45,155 --> 01:41:48,526
Why do you think I left Piccadilly?
My dear, they threw me out.

1556
01:41:48,618 --> 01:41:51,407
And why do you think
I haven't seen our child for two weeks?

1557
01:41:51,498 --> 01:41:53,741
Because I owe Mrs Gibson
15 guineas for the rent.

1558
01:41:53,835 --> 01:41:56,708
Do you think I like going out
with that little man from Venice?

1559
01:41:56,798 --> 01:41:58,342
I hate the sight of him

1560
01:41:58,427 --> 01:42:01,881
But I have to do it because he's promised me
a contract at his opera house.

1561
01:42:01,975 --> 01:42:03,933
Yes, I'm going back to work.

1562
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,930
I've done it before and I can do it again.

1563
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:07,766
I don't really mind.

1564
01:42:07,858 --> 01:42:10,433
You see, Horatio,
William didn't leave me a farthing.

1565
01:42:10,529 --> 01:42:12,689
- Why wasn't I told?
- Why should you be told?

1566
01:42:12,783 --> 01:42:14,527
These are my troubles, not yours.

1567
01:42:14,619 --> 01:42:17,576
I've never asked anyone for money
and I never shall.

1568
01:42:17,666 --> 01:42:18,580
Indeed?

1569
01:42:18,668 --> 01:42:20,708
Then are you out of your senses?

1570
01:42:22,716 --> 01:42:25,255
Now, you listen to me, and don't answer back!

1571
01:42:26,138 --> 01:42:28,263
How dare you keep those bills from me.

1572
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:30,392
Aren't your worries my worries?

1573
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:32,520
Everything I have is yours.

1574
01:42:32,608 --> 01:42:34,649
Everything!

1575
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:39,984
You're going to have a home of your own.

1576
01:42:40,078 --> 01:42:43,495
And there is going to be no sorrow
and no trouble ever again.

1577
01:42:44,836 --> 01:42:46,461
Emma.

1578
01:42:46,546 --> 01:42:47,578
Dear Emma.

1579
01:42:57,565 --> 01:43:00,734
Mm, that's the best drop of rum I've tasted
since the old days.

1580
01:43:00,821 --> 01:43:04,239
We don't get much excuse to open a bottle
lately. You should come oftener.

1581
01:43:04,326 --> 01:43:06,866
It warms the cockles of your heart. (Laughs)

1582
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,454
Captain Hardy, how nice to see you again.

1583
01:43:12,548 --> 01:43:14,292
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

1584
01:43:14,384 --> 01:43:18,681
Well, to tell you the truth, I just happened to be
passing and thought I'd come and see you.

1585
01:43:18,767 --> 01:43:20,095
Will you stay to luncheon?

1586
01:43:20,185 --> 01:43:22,178
Oh, thank you, my lady.

1587
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:26,223
Mother, darling, tell the coachman we leave
at two. I want the child here before dark.

1588
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:27,566
Yes, dear, I'll tell him.

1589
01:43:27,655 --> 01:43:30,694
He's in the garden. You can see his work of art
in the summerhouse.

1590
01:43:30,786 --> 01:43:34,288
I don't want to disturb him, my lady.
I know he likes his peace and quiet.

1591
01:43:34,376 --> 01:43:38,245
Just because he won't see St Vincent and Keith
when they write him pompous letters?

1592
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:39,883
Oh, no, Hardy, you're different.

1593
01:43:39,968 --> 01:43:41,511
You're an old friend. Come along.

1594
01:43:41,595 --> 01:43:45,215
No, to tell you the truth, Lady Hamilton,
I didn't come to see him.

1595
01:43:45,309 --> 01:43:47,018
I came to see you.

1596
01:43:47,103 --> 01:43:49,146
Me?
Yes.

1597
01:43:54,909 --> 01:43:57,864
There's no chance of our being overheard,
is there?

1598
01:43:57,955 --> 01:44:00,282
No, but what is the mystery?

1599
01:44:00,376 --> 01:44:04,209
Well, do you ever read the newspapers
down here?

1600
01:44:04,298 --> 01:44:06,175
Not unless we can help it.

1601
01:44:06,261 --> 01:44:09,050
We're not particularly interested
in the court news.

1602
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:10,850
Nor the gossip, the scandal.

1603
01:44:10,935 --> 01:44:14,686
You may have missed what happened.
Bonaparte's made himseIf Emperor of France.

1604
01:44:15,734 --> 01:44:17,562
Yes, we saw that.

1605
01:44:17,654 --> 01:44:19,065
What is his next move?

1606
01:44:19,156 --> 01:44:21,281
His next move will be the invasion of England.

1607
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,781
Oh, ridiculous!

1608
01:44:23,872 --> 01:44:25,250
So it may sound, my lady.

1609
01:44:25,335 --> 01:44:29,382
That's what we all thought when we first heard it.
But it's true. This peace was no good.

1610
01:44:29,466 --> 01:44:31,045
It'll break any day now.

1611
01:44:31,135 --> 01:44:34,885
This self-styled Emperor
has made an alliance with Spain.

1612
01:44:34,974 --> 01:44:37,728
He's raked together a new fleet
from goodness knows where.

1613
01:44:37,812 --> 01:44:41,230
And he's building transports and barges
as fast as he can turn them out.

1614
01:44:41,318 --> 01:44:45,235
From Boulogne to Brest,
every single Channel port is chock-full of them.

1615
01:44:45,325 --> 01:44:48,742
He's got a whole army behind him
waiting to embark.

1616
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:52,699
A few weeks from now,
all he'll need is a fair wind.

1617
01:44:53,755 --> 01:44:56,794
And all you'll need... will be Nelson.

1618
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,138
Yes, that's it, my lady.

1619
01:45:00,224 --> 01:45:02,135
- Is that all?
- That's all, my lady.

1620
01:45:02,228 --> 01:45:04,269
You see...

1621
01:45:04,356 --> 01:45:05,899
Well...

1622
01:45:05,984 --> 01:45:08,108
Nelson's the only man who can save us.

1623
01:45:08,196 --> 01:45:09,526
Now, listen to me, Hardy,

1624
01:45:09,615 --> 01:45:13,484
I have helped the Navy whenever I could,
but not this time, Hardy, not this time.

1625
01:45:13,579 --> 01:45:17,910
Let them find some other man to take command.
Keith or Parker or St Vincent himself. Not him!

1626
01:45:18,002 --> 01:45:20,674
Don't they understand, Hardy?
He's given so much.

1627
01:45:20,757 --> 01:45:22,300
His arm, his sight, his health.

1628
01:45:22,385 --> 01:45:24,178
He needs rest and he must have it.

1629
01:45:24,264 --> 01:45:27,469
For the first time in his life
he's found peace of mind and happiness.

1630
01:45:27,561 --> 01:45:29,306
And I'm going to see that he keeps it.

1631
01:45:29,397 --> 01:45:31,307
If they want me to use my influence, I will.

1632
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:35,614
All my influence to persuade him
that this new war is none of his business!

1633
01:45:38,287 --> 01:45:40,079
That's...

1634
01:45:40,165 --> 01:45:42,206
all I have to say.

1635
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:47,590
Of course, there's nothing to prevent you from
talking it over with him personally at luncheon.

1636
01:45:48,844 --> 01:45:51,134
Will you stay?
No, thank you, my lady.

1637
01:45:51,223 --> 01:45:54,061
I think perhaps l'd better get back.

1638
01:45:55,898 --> 01:45:57,144
Goodbye, Hardy.

1639
01:46:04,746 --> 01:46:06,787
(Carriage withdraws)

1640
01:46:56,373 --> 01:46:59,993
Oh, come along. I thought you were dressing.
What have you been doing?

1641
01:47:00,087 --> 01:47:03,256
We'll never get there if you don't look sharp.
Besides, I'm hungry.

1642
01:47:03,342 --> 01:47:04,588
Starving.

1643
01:47:04,678 --> 01:47:06,755
I don't think we'll go today, Horatio.

1644
01:47:06,848 --> 01:47:11,727
It will save two trips if we pick her up tomorrow,
after you've been to the Admiralty.

1645
01:47:14,485 --> 01:47:16,028
The Admiralty?

1646
01:47:16,113 --> 01:47:17,940
Hardy has been here. They sent him.

1647
01:47:18,032 --> 01:47:20,074
They need you, dear, badly.

1648
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:23,284
This war is coming, as you always said it would.

1649
01:47:23,376 --> 01:47:25,416
And there's no-one else.

1650
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:46,366
Did you tell Hardy I would go?

1651
01:47:47,456 --> 01:47:49,496
Yes.

1652
01:47:50,462 --> 01:47:52,705
It's a matter of course, dear, isn't it?

1653
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:08,113
It'll be freezing tonight on the high roads
over the downs.

1654
01:48:08,199 --> 01:48:10,656
Yes,
I think I'll take the little rug I use in my study.

1655
01:48:10,745 --> 01:48:13,700
- Oh, yes, I know, I'll get it.
- I'll get it, Mother.

1656
01:48:30,151 --> 01:48:32,192
(Carriage withdraws)

1657
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:41,749
He thought he wouldn't need the rug.

1658
01:48:49,058 --> 01:48:51,099
He'll never come back, Mother.

1659
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:09,831
? Cheer up, my lads,'tis to glory we steer

1660
01:49:10,425 --> 01:49:15,386
? To add something new to this wonderful year

1661
01:49:15,475 --> 01:49:19,726
? To honour we call you as free men not slaves

1662
01:49:19,817 --> 01:49:24,030
? For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

1663
01:49:24,115 --> 01:49:26,239
? Hearts of oak are our ships

1664
01:49:26,327 --> 01:49:28,368
? Jolly tars are our men

1665
01:49:29,248 --> 01:49:31,621
? We always are ready

1666
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:33,750
? Steady, boys, steady

1667
01:49:34,297 --> 01:49:38,761
? We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again

1668
01:49:39,514 --> 01:49:42,351
Mr Pasco,
I will now amuse the fleet with a signal.

1669
01:49:43,146 --> 01:49:44,475
Mr Pasco,

1670
01:49:44,565 --> 01:49:46,605
I wish to say to the fleet...

1671
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,479
..''England confides
that every man will do his duty.''

1672
01:49:50,575 --> 01:49:52,901
Be quick. I've one more to follow for close action.

1673
01:49:52,995 --> 01:49:56,163
If you will permit me to substitute
''expects'' for ''confides'',

1674
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,580
it will be sooner completed.

1675
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:59,711
That will do. Make it directly.

1676
01:50:00,801 --> 01:50:03,756
Those Frenchmen
have sharpshooters up in the rigging, sir.

1677
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:05,045
I know. Why do you tell me?

1678
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,973
Do you think it's wise to wear all those
decorations? They make a nice target.

1679
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:11,352
- I won them in battle, didn't l?
- Yes, sir, but...

1680
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:13,481
Then I shall wear them in battle.

1681
01:50:35,691 --> 01:50:36,557
England...

1682
01:50:44,453 --> 01:50:45,449
Expects...

1683
01:50:46,374 --> 01:50:47,453
That...

1684
01:50:48,378 --> 01:50:49,327
Every...

1685
01:50:50,381 --> 01:50:51,045
Man...

1686
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,635
Will...

1687
01:50:54,721 --> 01:50:55,468
Do...

1688
01:50:56,766 --> 01:50:58,427
His...

1689
01:50:59,187 --> 01:51:00,183
Duty.

1690
01:51:00,272 --> 01:51:04,189
? Come cheer up, my lads,'tis to glory we sail

1691
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:08,029
? To add something new to this wonderful year

1692
01:51:08,785 --> 01:51:13,367
? To honour we call you as free men not slaves

1693
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:17,793
? For who are so free as the sons of the waves?

1694
01:51:17,885 --> 01:51:19,925
? Hearts of oak are our ships

1695
01:51:20,013 --> 01:51:22,220
? Jolly tars are our men

1696
01:51:23,101 --> 01:51:25,558
? We always are ready

1697
01:51:25,646 --> 01:51:28,650
? Steady, boys, steady

1698
01:51:28,735 --> 01:51:30,610
? We'll fight and we'll conquer...

1699
01:51:30,697 --> 01:51:32,737
We'll be on them in half an hour, sir.

1700
01:51:43,342 --> 01:51:46,179
Mon capitaine,
la flotte enemie est nord-ouest et bâbord.

1701
01:51:46,264 --> 01:51:49,101
Mon amiral,
la flotte enemie est nord-ouest et bâbord.

1702
01:51:49,186 --> 01:51:50,467
Prèparez pour l'attaque.

1703
01:52:10,637 --> 01:52:12,678
(Cannonfire)

1704
01:52:33,298 --> 01:52:35,707
- They're getting pretty close now, sir.
-Not yet.

1705
01:52:35,802 --> 01:52:36,752
(Explosions)

1706
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:15,283
Starboard broadside fire as you bear.

1707
01:53:15,368 --> 01:53:17,860
(Repeats order)

1708
01:53:47,838 --> 01:53:49,796
(Man shouts)

1709
01:54:01,402 --> 01:54:03,729
(Cannonfire continues)

1710
01:54:45,849 --> 01:54:47,890
Voilà l'Amiral!

1711
01:54:55,241 --> 01:54:56,023
Sir!

1712
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,875
They've... done for me, at last.

1713
01:55:03,961 --> 01:55:05,706
You're not badly hurt, are you, sir?

1714
01:55:05,798 --> 01:55:08,207
My backbone... shot through.

1715
01:55:08,302 --> 01:55:10,512
(Explosions)

1716
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:18,774
HARDY: I'll carry you to Dr Beattie.
- You stay on deck. Come to me when you can.

1717
01:55:20,906 --> 01:55:23,032
Cover my face... these decorations.

1718
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,908
No time for the men to see me like this.

1719
01:55:29,588 --> 01:55:31,629
(Explosions continue)

1720
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:05,141
Mr Beattie...

1721
01:56:06,315 --> 01:56:09,318
... I have no feeling... below my breast.

1722
01:56:10,907 --> 01:56:12,947
No lower.

1723
01:56:13,035 --> 01:56:15,075
I know what that means, Mr Beattie.

1724
01:56:16,372 --> 01:56:17,832
My spine is broken.

1725
01:56:17,916 --> 01:56:20,290
My lord...unhappily for our country,

1726
01:56:20,379 --> 01:56:22,953
nothing...can be done for you.

1727
01:56:23,968 --> 01:56:26,010
Poor Emma.

1728
01:56:26,765 --> 01:56:28,806
What will become of her?

1729
01:56:47,842 --> 01:56:49,882
(Shouting from above deck)

1730
01:56:52,222 --> 01:56:53,421
Was that cheering?

1731
01:56:53,516 --> 01:56:55,474
They're cheering in all our ships, my lord.

1732
01:56:55,561 --> 01:56:57,638
The French line has broken.

1733
01:56:57,731 --> 01:56:59,772
Why doesn't Hardy come?

1734
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:02,780
- He must be killed.
- He's on deck, sir. He can't leave.

1735
01:57:02,866 --> 01:57:04,906
(Shouting)

1736
01:57:23,525 --> 01:57:25,020
(Moans)

1737
01:57:25,111 --> 01:57:26,570
(Gasps)

1738
01:57:26,655 --> 01:57:28,694
They're cheering again.

1739
01:57:29,491 --> 01:57:31,652
The French flagship has surrendered, sir.

1740
01:57:32,538 --> 01:57:34,247
(Croakily ) Good.

1741
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:35,959
Why don't they bring Hardy to me?

1742
01:57:36,045 --> 01:57:38,834
He sends a message, sir.
We're against the Redoubtable.

1743
01:57:38,925 --> 01:57:41,085
When we have beaten her, he will come.

1744
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:43,219
(Nelson gasps)

1745
01:58:18,699 --> 01:58:21,405
- How goes it, Hardy?
- Fourteen of them are ours, sir.

1746
01:58:22,997 --> 01:58:24,907
Not enough.

1747
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,373
Twenty. Twenty.

1748
01:58:37,814 --> 01:58:41,600
(Gasps) Don't throw me overboard, Hardy.

1749
01:58:41,695 --> 01:58:44,530
No, sir.
You know what to do.

1750
01:58:45,992 --> 01:58:49,694
Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair...

1751
01:58:50,834 --> 01:58:52,543
..and all things belonging to me.

1752
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:55,466
You mustn't die, sir. You mustn't die!

1753
01:58:56,552 --> 01:58:58,545
(Softly ) It's all over now, Hardy.

1754
01:58:58,638 --> 01:59:00,679
All over now.

1755
01:59:02,269 --> 01:59:03,765
(Whispers)

1756
01:59:03,855 --> 01:59:05,101
Sir!

1757
01:59:05,191 --> 01:59:08,230
Sir! It's eighteen now sir

1758
01:59:09,574 --> 01:59:11,817
Eighteen - a great victory.

1759
01:59:16,209 --> 01:59:18,250
Thank God.

1760
01:59:19,338 --> 01:59:21,379
I have done my duty.

1761
01:59:24,681 --> 01:59:27,434
Kiss me...Hardy.

1762
01:59:52,059 --> 01:59:55,229
I am the resurrection and the life,
sayeth the Lord.

1763
01:59:55,315 --> 02:00:00,109
He that believeth in me
though he were dead, yet shall he live;

1764
02:00:00,197 --> 02:00:03,734
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die.

1765
02:00:05,081 --> 02:00:07,122
(Continues sermon)

1766
02:00:45,564 --> 02:00:48,769
It's all right, Anna, I'll draw them myself.
Thank you.

1767
02:01:27,173 --> 02:01:28,668
My lady.

1768
02:01:28,758 --> 02:01:32,178
- Do you come from Portsmouth, Hardy?
-No, Spithead, Lady Hamilton.

1769
02:01:32,266 --> 02:01:34,509
I came on the St George, she's our fastest ship.

1770
02:01:34,603 --> 02:01:38,224
Captain Blackwood went ahead to London
with the news.

1771
02:01:38,318 --> 02:01:40,358
What is the news, Hardy?

1772
02:01:41,155 --> 02:01:44,656
It was a great victory.
It was the greatest we've ever known.

1773
02:01:45,412 --> 02:01:47,451
That's wonderful.

1774
02:01:49,084 --> 02:01:50,876
It was nine days ago...

1775
02:01:52,255 --> 02:01:56,885
we engaged them off Cape Trafalgar
the combined fleets of France and Spain

1776
02:01:59,184 --> 02:02:01,225
They've been destroyed

1777
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:06,101
The oceans are free once more
and England is safe from invasion

1778
02:02:10,953 --> 02:02:15,036
The first cannon was fired a little after twelve

1779
02:02:16,254 --> 02:02:20,004
Within one hour five French
ships-of-the-line had struck their flags

1780
02:02:20,094 --> 02:02:21,969
His plan was magnificent

1781
02:02:22,055 --> 02:02:25,472
He swung our fleet from line of battle
into two spearheads,

1782
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,433
that broke the enemy line
into three separate parts.

1783
02:02:29,358 --> 02:02:30,189
Then...

1784
02:02:32,029 --> 02:02:36,245
about one-thirty
I was walking with him on the upper deck

1785
02:02:38,416 --> 02:02:39,910
The fighting was at its height

1786
02:02:40,001 --> 02:02:42,957
The French flagship the Redoubtable
came through the smoke

1787
02:02:43,048 --> 02:02:46,133
and we fought alongside one another

1788
02:02:46,219 --> 02:02:48,260
he was so

1789
02:02:48,347 --> 02:02:50,305
confident.

1790
02:02:51,436 --> 02:02:54,143
We'd just...turned to go...back to the...

1791
02:02:55,109 --> 02:02:57,437
(Sobs)

1792
02:03:11,929 --> 02:03:13,969
By sunset

1793
02:03:14,057 --> 02:03:16,097
everything was over

1794
02:03:17,562 --> 02:03:18,642
But

1795
02:03:18,731 --> 02:03:22,232
he he lived to know
he'd won England's greatest victory

1796
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:28,490
His His last thoughts were with you my lady

1797
02:03:30,168 --> 02:03:32,624
That you should be cared for

1798
02:03:36,677 --> 02:03:38,717
(Sobs softly )

1799
02:03:54,789 --> 02:03:56,832
(Door slams)

1800
02:04:55,305 --> 02:04:58,510
- And then?
- Then what?

1801
02:04:58,602 --> 02:05:00,644
What happened after?

1802
02:05:05,615 --> 02:05:07,655
There is no then.

1803
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:11,363
There is no after.
