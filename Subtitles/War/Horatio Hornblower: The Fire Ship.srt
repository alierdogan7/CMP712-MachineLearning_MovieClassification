1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,690
Visitors, sir.  Spanish colours.
A captain among them.

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,980
Inform Captain Pellew,
Mr. Hornblower.

3
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,980
Aye, aye, sir.

4
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:03,401
Side boys!  Boswain's mates!

5
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,802
Drummers!  Man the sides!

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,620
-Captain, you said?
-Full dress uniform, sir.

7
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,620
I fear the worst, Mr. Hornblower.

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,600
A British supply ship
bound for Gibraltar.

9
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,420
Commander Morris!

10
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,520
-A fair wind at last,Commander.
-In our favour, Captain Foster.

11
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,290
You'll see Gibraltar and the
Dreadnought before mid-day.

12
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,580
Nor before time, Commander,
not before time.

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Deck there.
Sail fine off the starboard bow!

14
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,620
Allies, thank goodness.
A Spanish frigate.

15
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,620
Spanish? Never trust the Spanish,
Commander Morris.

16
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,020
Steer well clear of her,
Master Figgis.

17
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,620
-How's your Spanish, Hornblower?
-Not good sir.

18
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,720
Then he'll surely understand French.

19
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,880
Ask him below for a glass of wine.

20
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,399
He declines the offer sir, and says
that the letter is

21
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,620
from the Duke of Belcite.
He insists you open it at once.

22
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,180
Oh, does he?
Does he indeed?

23
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,600
I suppose this means that the Spanish

24
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,520
have made peace with France.

25
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,620
They want us to heave to.
I don't like the smell of this.

26
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,520
Luff and touch her, Master Figgis.

27
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,050
We might be able to outrun
her windward.

28
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,520
Outrun her?  Are you mad?
She'll be on us in minutes.

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,620
His excellency, the Duke of Belchite
grandee of the first class

30
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,200
Commander-in-chief of his
Catholic majesty's forces

31
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,620
by land and by sea,

32
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,620
knight of the Most Sacred Order
of the Golden Fleece,

33
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,200
First minister of his most
Catholic majesty,

34
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,799
-Captain General of Andalusia…
-Yes, all right, Mr. Hornblower.

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,600
I think we've quite established
our friend the Duke's eminence.

36
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,620
-What else does he say?
-Hold your luff, Master Frigus.

37
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,620
-We may outrun them yet.
-Belay that order!

38
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,420
She'll blow us out of the water.
We must turn and

39
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,029
defend ourselves. Let her go off.

40
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,380
-I am in command of this vessel,sir.
-And I am of superior rank

41
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,620
and I assume command of this vessel.
Hard up on the helm!

42
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,221
We are out-manned and outgunned
this is sheer madness!

43
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,600
What? What is he saying?

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,480
According to the rules of neutrality,

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,480
we have 6 hours before the Spanish
start firing on us, sir.

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,300
You tell him, sir…

47
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,380
'Darned if I'll let him see
he's made me angry.

48
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,200
-We must surrender before
it's too late!
-Hold your course.

49
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,599
You tell him, sir.

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,199
You know the kind of thing
I want said

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,720
-don't you, Hornblower?
-Yes sir.

52
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,500
Get him over the side, with dignity.

53
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Mr. Bowles,I want to be underway
within the hour,if you please.

54
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,301
Go and jump, men!

55
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,180
Winds of change, Mr. Hornblower.

56
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,380
How quickly friends become enemies
in the teeth of war.

57
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,280
Enemies, sir?  The duke said they
were to be neutral.

58
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,180
A meaningless word.A short step from
there into bed with France

59
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,900
I foresee a day when the
whole of Europe

60
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,080
will be arrayed against us.

61
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,499
We will prevail, sir. They say
we have God on our side.

62
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,100
Really? Then let us pray the Almighty

63
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,960
never chooses to become neutral.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,900
Where is the frigate?

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,200
-Where's the frigate?  Answer me!
-You killed us all.

66
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,300
Anybody else?
Anybody else?

67
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,380
Wreckage in the water
to larboard, sir!

68
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,900
Inform the captain, Mr. Cleveland.

69
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,300
Poor devils.

70
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,300
Looks like one of ours.

71
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
A supply ship, sir.

72
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,380
Must have been returning
to Gibraltar.

73
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,980
The work of a neutral power,
Mr. Hornblower?

74
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,780
Spanish, sir?
That would be an act of war!

75
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,600
I expected nothing less.

76
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,300
Over there, sir.  Survivors.

77
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Let me see.

78
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,980
Goodness gracious.
Unless my eye deceives me…

79
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,780
-Yes, we have an honoured guest.
-Sir?

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,420
-Captain Foster, I believe.
-Dreadnought Foster, sir?

81
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,020
I do not care for such overblown
titles, Mr. Hornblower.

82
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,380
Mr. Bowles, bring us up
to windward of them.

83
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:08,281
Aye, aye, Captain.
Man braces, stand by to luff up!

84
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,700
You're all right now lad,that's it.
There you go. Come on,then.

85
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,380
Captain Foster.

86
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,380
-Captain Pellew.
-Welcome aboard, sir.

87
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,380
I congratulate you on your
impeccable timing, sir.

88
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,280
An honour to be of service, as ever.

89
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,999
Forgive me if I forego the usual
pleasantries, Captain,

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,580
till I have discovered my limbs.

91
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,220
Of course.

92
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,980
Mr. Hornblower, have quarters
prepared for the captain here,

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,900
and pass word on to my servant
to find him

94
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,880
-some old clothing of mine.
-Aye, aye, sir.

95
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:07,499
I would welcome your presence
at dinner in my quarters,Captain

96
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,199
Why, I shall be honoured
to attend, sir.

97
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,620
Pass word on to the other
officers, Hornblower.

98
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,180
Oh, get that off me man.
Take me to the rum.

99
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,620
I fear our captain is not
counted amongst

100
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,780
-our guest's admirers, Mr. Hornblower
-The man is a legend.

101
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,900
Indeed, but there are some who might

102
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:34,820
consider his methods reckless.

103
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Well, I was merely a passenger
on the schooner

104
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:41,199
on my way to Gibraltar to resume
command of the Dreadnought

105
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
when this, this Spanish frigate
blocked our path.

106
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,380
We were out-manned and out-gunned,
and should we have run,

107
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
we should certainly have been
outpaced.

108
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,499
Did they fire without warning, sir?

109
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,380
Oh, they had the decency
to fire a warning shot.

110
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,300
The audacity of them!

111
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,200
Three supply ships taken by
the French in as many weeks,

112
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,780
and now the Spanish think
they can do the same?

113
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,700
Well, this was one ship they
would never take. So...

114
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:07,820
I assumed command of the schooner,

115
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,099
gave the order we should
attempt to rake her.

116
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,400
Now, of course, I knew our
chances were slim,

117
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,699
but I took comfort from the fact
that they would be forced

118
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,799
to destroy their prize,
and had I not acted,

119
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,599
the schooner and her supplies
would at this very moment

120
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,380
-be in the hands of the Spanish.
-What of the crew?

121
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,180
You have a question, Captain?

122
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,200
I was merely wondering how many of
the crew

123
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:33,199
-did the Spanish take from the sea?
-I have no idea.

124
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,300
At the time, my mind was engaged

125
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:39,580
in more important matters
than arithmetic.

126
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Am I to presume Captain Pellew
that you would have surrendered?

127
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,380
This is neither the time or
the place, sir, to discuss tactics.

128
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,480
Nonsense!  We're all men
of the sea here.

129
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,080
-You!
-Yes, sir?

130
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,080
How would you have reacted
to such circumstances?

131
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,000
-I think perhaps…
-Come on man, out with it.

132
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,380
I am pleased the Spanish have been
deprived of our supplies,sir

133
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,380
I take my leave, sir.

134
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,400
I fancy you shall go far, young man,
I fancy you shall.

135
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,780
-Algeciras.
-Sir?

136
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
A cruel hand dealt by the Almighty
to set a Spanish anchorage

137
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:01,380
six miles off Gibraltar,
 don't you think?

138
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,900
Report, if you please.

139
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,480
Eight ships, I think, sir.

140
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,380
-Nine, with their yards crossed.
-Thank-you.

141
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,480
Captain Pellew, sir.

142
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,780
I believe I might have offended
you earlier.

143
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,380
Yes, Mr. Hornblower?

144
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,180
Might I offer my apologies, sir?

145
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,480
Your apology is noted.

146
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,400
Thank-you, sir.

147
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,801
Let go!

148
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,080
-Mr. Hornblower.
-Sir.

149
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,380
When we next meet,I believe
you will have your commission, sir.

150
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:03,700
-Sir?
-Well, I presume you are putting
yourself forward

151
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,999
for examination for lieutenant.

152
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,680
That is my captain's decision, sir.

153
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,400
The port admiral awaits.

154
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,680
You're much taken with our famous
Captain Foster

155
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,500
and he with you.

156
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,380
He's a truly great man, sir.

157
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,180
To be half the man that he is
would see my life fulfilled.

158
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,380
Careful, Mr. Hornblower.

159
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,880
Such greatness always has its price.

160
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,900
Come.

161
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,300
You wish to see me, sir?

162
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,380
Mr. Hornblower. Yes, I hope
you consider this good news.

163
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,480
-You're ready to take your
examination for lieutenant?
-Yes,sir.

164
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,499
Good. Then I shall put you forward
for next month's round.

165
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,380
-I would be honoured, sir.
-Should you do well,

166
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,120
you will already have two
months seniority. Do badly,

167
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,900
and it's back with the midshipmen
for six months at least.

168
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,301
-I understand that, sir.
-Well, you'd better spend

169
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,780
-your spare time in study.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,180
You're on a run, Mr. Bowles.

171
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,380
I do believe your hands are
tied, Mr. Bracegirdle.

172
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,620
No prison's held me yet, sir.
Yes!

173
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,920
Your throw, sir.
The tables are turning.

174
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,300
Hold still lad.
Don't want to waste it.

175
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,380
I see you've taken me at
my word, Mr. Hornblower.

176
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,380
But, could you not find a place
to study below decks?

177
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,380
No sir, I was searching for
some peace and quiet.

178
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,380
Oh yes, of course. I apologize
for disturbing you.

179
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,380
-No sir, I, I didn't mean…
-As you were, Mr. Hornblower.

180
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,400
Yes, you'll find time to study,

181
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:37,599
when these high spirits are dulled.

182
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,599
-Why is that, sir?
-Captain Foster's recent engagement

183
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,830
with our Spanish friends has deprived

184
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,099
the fleet of its regular supplies

185
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,380
leaving me no alternative but
to cut the rations...

186
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,080
- by half.
-Half, sir?

187
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:54,880
Indeed, Mr. Hornblower.
No doubt Captain Foster

188
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,380
will be forced to follow a similar
prudent path.

189
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:01,100
Yes, sir.

190
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,690
A side of beef and a gallon
of rum, if you please.

191
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,380
Sounds like you've been
at the rum already.

192
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,329
-What's this?
-Half rations. Captain's orders.

193
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,450
On account,Bunting,there's been no
supply ship for seven weeks.

194
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,420
What of the captain?
Is he on half-rations?

195
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,200
That's dangerous talk, Bunting.

196
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,720
You'd better bite your tongue
to save it.

197
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
Styles.

198
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,820
Oldroyd.

199
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,300
Finch.

200
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,900
And that should just leave
Bunting and me.

201
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,100
For what we are about to receive,

202
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:11,200
let us thank the good Captain Pellew.

203
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:16,601
<i>It's a gallant British man-of-war
lies in Gibraltar Bay,</i>

204
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:19,700
<i>And the jolly jacks aboard her wish</i>

205
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:22,801
<i>that they could have their say.
But, they must keep</i>

206
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:26,103
<i>their mouths tight shut although
their thoughts be dark.</i>

207
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,290
-Cleveland!
-Yes, sir.

208
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,100
See if you can't put an end to
that infernal racket.

209
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,100
Cleveland, the nightingales are
in full voice tonight,

210
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,220
-are they not?
-Yes sir,

211
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,700
but Mr. Hornblower
has little time for birdsong.

212
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:49,000
<i>It is a clear and cloudless night
and the wind</i>

213
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:52,601
<i>was steady and strong.
  And we have laid in Gibraltar Bay</i>

214
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:56,520
<i>for many a day too long.  
Biscuits one, pease pudding none,</i>

215
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:59,800
-"and salt beef only half…"
-You men, I said you men!

216
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Acting Lieutenant Hornblower requests

217
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:07,520
a little less gusto in the chorus,
if you please.

218
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,820
<i>Biscuits one, pease pudding none
and salt beef only half.</i>

219
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,421
<i>Our rations will not feed a man but
our officers only laugh.</i>

220
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:24,022
<i>It's a gallant British man-o-war
lies in Gibraltar Bay,</i>

221
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,723
<i>And the jolly jacks aboard
her wish that</i>

222
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:29,499
-"they could have their say."
-A moment, Mr. Hornblower.

223
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,420
-Sir?
-You sent a message to quiet the men.

224
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,720
I merely wish to concentrate
on my studies, sir.

225
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,890
Is something troubling your mind?

226
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,220
I fear there is too much to learn.

227
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,820
I can't help but question
my readiness.

228
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,608
Yes, I remember my examination.

229
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,499
Like you, I spent weeks with
my nose in a book,

230
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,420
and was fortunate to be tested on
a subject I knew well.

231
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,420
But, it's after the examination that
the real test begins.

232
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:05,100
-Sir?
-A book can teach you how to
steer a ship,

233
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:08,200
but it can never show you how
to manage a starving crew.

234
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:11,199
The men are afraid, Horatio.
Many have seen before

235
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,320
the effects of prolonged rationing.
They fear a future

236
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,420
-of disease and death.
-But why are they singing?

237
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,200
Given the choice between
singing and weeping,

238
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,799
which would you fancy?

239
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,899
A good lieutenant gets to know
the ways of his men.

240
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,200
If you wish to test your
readiness, begin there.

241
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,680
Out or down, Out or down.
Up and out.

242
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,420
You look like I feel, Finch.

243
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,499
It's just me lungs has caught
a wind.

244
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,420
Pull me up.

245
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,700
-I can't take your ration.
-You need it more than me.

246
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,200
Boswain's not half-rations.

247
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:00,801
Over here, lads! Lend a hand.

248
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,702
-What's happened?
-Fallen.

249
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,620
-Is he all right?
-He's weak, sir

250
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:09,499
too weak to climb the ratlines.

251
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,280
-Lack of decent grub, I reckon.
-Take him to the sick berth.

252
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,820
We sit around doing nothing
while the Spanish

253
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,420
-pick off our ships.
-At your ease, there, Mr. Hornblower.

254
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,420
We should be out there, following
Captain Foster's example.

255
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,420
Captain Foster failed,
as I remember it.

256
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:32,100
Better to try and fail than
to sit and rot in disease

257
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,920
and starvation.

258
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,399
I believe you have overstepped
the mark, Mr. Hornblower.

259
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,480
I apologize, sir.

260
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,299
Well, Finch, you seem to have landed

261
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,499
yourself a comfortable position.

262
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,120
-How soon before we're home?
-Home?

263
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,490
-Mr. Hornblower?
-Yes, that's right.

264
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,300
At your ease, Man, at your ease.

265
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,700
It's the old muscles is letting
me down a bit, sir.

266
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,620
-How long have I been here?
-A few days now.

267
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,620
It seems...This darn fever.

268
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,500
-I can't rightly remember.
-You'll make it through.

269
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,420
How long now till Portsmouth?

270
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,220
Not long now.

271
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,900
'Reckon he's getting worse, sir?

272
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,300
-He seems confused.
-Fever, sir.

273
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,499
I've been trying to keep him going,
keep him awake,

274
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,420
and thinking.
But, he just drifts off.

275
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,100
I don't know that he'll make it.

276
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,420
Finch!  How's your reading, Finch?

277
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,500
-Reading, sir?
-Can you read?

278
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,900
Finch!

279
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,420
-Aye, sir?
-Can you read?

280
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,780
I...I can read the Bible sir.

281
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,420
Here...Clarke's Complete Handbook
of Seamanship.

282
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,420
That's mighty kind of you sir.

283
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:14,420
I'm sure I'll enjoy it very much

284
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,699
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I want you to test me.

285
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,420
Test you, sir?

286
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,499
I might have my examination for
lieutenant coming up shortly,

287
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,490
I need someone to test my knowledge.

288
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,420
I'd be honoured if you'd help me.

289
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,420
Come on man, clear your mind.
Ask me a question.

290
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,520
-Question, sir?
-I want you to test me.

291
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,220
Come on, think!

292
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,420
I reckon I don't need no book
to test you, sir.

293
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,420
Right then, give me your best.

294
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,420
A supply ship.

295
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,420
A supply ship coming in!

296
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,300
-Pass the word, Mr. Cleveland.
-Right, sir.

297
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,680
A supply ship!
A supply ship's been sighted.

298
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,500
Easy there, Cleveland.
Where's the fire?

299
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,999
Sorry, sir, but it's a supply ship.

300
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,780
-Spread the word, Mr. Cleveland.
-Aye, aye, sir.

301
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:33,650
A supply ship.  A supply ship's
been sighted.

302
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:37,125
A supply ship!  A supply
ship's been sighted.

303
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:40,900
A supply ship.
A supply ship's on its way.

304
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,499
Fisherman's bend, you say?

305
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,900
Finch!

306
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,780
-Yes, sir?
-How do you tie a fisherman's bend?

307
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,499
How is he, sir?

308
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,420
I can't keep him awake.

309
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,620
Perhaps this will.
There's a supply ship in sight.

310
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:07,900
You hear that?
Finch!

311
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,420
A fine sight, Mr. Hornblower.

312
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400
Indeed, sir.

313
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,920
What's that light, Mr. Bracegirdle?

314
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
It looks like a flame, sir.

315
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
Oh my God.

316
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,820
-What is it?
-A fire ship, sir.

317
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,820
-A fire ship.
-A Spanish fire ship.

318
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,300
-What about the guard ship, sir?
-Too far astern.

319
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,420
She's gone, sir.

320
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,620
Thank-you, Mr. Bracegirdle.

321
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,820
Get these men belowdecks.

322
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,520
Mr. Harris, get them below!

323
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:42,521
Belowdecks!  Right, down you go.
Belowdecks.

324
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,820
It's the first time I've seen
the Spanish use a fire ship.

325
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,899
Perhaps they take their
example from us.

326
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,700
The student outstrips the master, eh?

327
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,180
Finch, I've brought you some food.

328
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:51,699
All right then, lads.  Come on.

329
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,020
Gather round, now,gentlemen.
Dig in your pockets.Dig deeply.

330
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:09,020
Generosity for the dead man's widow.

331
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,899
Who'll give me a start?

332
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,980
A penny for the lot.

333
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,899
Come on gentlemen, this is serious.

334
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,820
Now, we've got a good
sturdy pipe, here.

335
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,100
-Who will offer me 5 pence?
-Ten shillings for the lot.

336
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,420
That's more than a week's pay.
Are you sure, man?

337
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,880
Bunting!

338
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,820
-A black day, Matthews.
-He was a fine man, sir.

339
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,180
-And as such he will be remembered.
-Yes, sir.

340
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,820
This...fellow, Bunting, seems
to be taking it bad.

341
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,899
Yes, sir. They were mates
on another ship

342
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,899
when Bunting was first pressed.

343
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,899
The way I heard it, Finch helped
him to settle down.

344
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,220
-I see. Thank-you, Matthews.
-Aye, aye, sir.

345
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,850
We are to accompany the
transport brig, "Caroline"

346
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:44,470
on a supplies mission to Oran.
My compliments to the Master.

347
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,999
Please inform Mr. Bowles to ready
the ship for sail.

348
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,699
We are to be joined by a Mr. Tapling
of the Diplomatic Service,

349
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,200
who will conduct negotiations.
See to it he's comfortable.

350
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,700
For goodness sake, man,
keep it steady!

351
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,100
Swing him inboard and lower it away.

352
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,820
Steady with those ropes.
Steady man!

353
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,300
-Welcome aboard, sir.
-Welcome aboard?

354
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,820
I've never been so mishandled
in my entire life.

355
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:25,400
-Do you know who I am, sir?
-Mr. Tapling, sir

356
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,999
-of the Diplomatic Service.
-Well, at least that's something.

357
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,520
Mr. Hornblower, get that raffle
cleared away immediately!

358
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:37,600
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Well, help me!

359
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,820
They have their own secret
store of supplies.

360
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,680
-Who told you that?
-They dine like kings.

361
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,890
-'Away with ya, man.
-Sure as I'm pressed here!

362
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,500
That's why we're on half rations
to keep them

363
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,899
in their kingly ways.

364
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,020
If it weren't for the officers,
we'd be on two-thirds at least.

365
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,820
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

366
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,500
A word…

367
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,899
Sorry, sir.  'Didn't mean no harm.

368
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,820
-Just idle talk, is all.
-Idle talk will get you hanged, man.

369
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,300
What if I'd been the captain?

370
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:29,620
-And where did you hear such stories?
-Just been talking, sir,

371
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:32,899
talking in general.
I can't rightly remember where.

372
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,380
-Very convenient.  
-Do you require assistance,
Mr. Hornblower?

373
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,300
No sir, I will deal with it.

374
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,620
These...stories, do you take
them to be true?

375
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,020
No, sir.

376
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:50,200
I'm sorry, sir. I was out of
place in what I said.

377
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:54,100
Indeed you were.

378
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,620
I understand that
Finch was a close friend.

379
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,620
I owed him much, sir.

380
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,620
I, too, was in his debt.

381
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,220
And that is why you are not
already in irons. But,

382
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:11,620
you must understand there
can be no excuse for mutinous talk.

383
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,620
-Yes, sir.
-I shall be watching the men closely.

384
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,230
If morale sinks, I'll know who
to blame.

385
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,900
Return to your work.

386
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,700
We take what's ours.

387
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,500
-That's stealing.
-How can you steal something

388
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,699
that rightfully belongs to you?

389
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,699
-You're talking mutiny, Bunting.
-And what if I am?

390
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,620
How else can we put a stop
to this injustice?

391
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,220
I won't be party to this
sort of talk.

392
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,800
Nor I.

393
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,300
Nor I.

394
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,100
You'll think differently when
you're spitting out teeth!

395
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,620
Mr. Hornblower, a word if you please.

396
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,320
My quarters are entirely
unacceptable.

397
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:20,700
They are the best we have
to offer, sir.

398
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,299
They smell of sweat, and worse.

399
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,699
See to it that I am moved
immediately.

400
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,180
Thank-you.

401
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,820
I came back to find the lock burst.
I'm sure he's in the hold.

402
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,620
Bunting!  What do you think
you're doing?

403
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,500
I'M HUNNGRRY!  I'M HUNNGRRY!

404
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,220
What kind of man are you?

405
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,900
That would steal food from
his shipmates' bellies?

406
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,200
Have you no shame?

407
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,380
I despair, I really do.

408
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Very well. We must follow
example with example.

409
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,599
Mr. Hornblower, let the crew show
their disgust for this...

410
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,620
-...creature.
-Sir?

411
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,621
The gauntlet, Mr. Hornblower.

412
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,620
Please sir, it was a
moment's madness.

413
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,620
Quiet! The punishment
shall fit the crime.

414
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,300
If I may interject, sir.

415
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,620
I should bear the responsibility
for Bunting's actions.

416
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,800
You?

417
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:25,880
I earlier overheard him goading
the crew with rumours and lies.

418
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:29,299
I should have dealt with
him more firmly.

419
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,620
Very well, Mr. Hornblower, you
shall make your amends

420
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,900
by leading him yourself,
through the gauntlet.

421
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,620
Bring him out.

422
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,380
This man is a thief!

423
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,620
A man caught stealing food
from the hold

424
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,100
steals it from each and
every one of you.

425
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,620
Make sure you teach him his lesson.

426
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:20,620
Any man going easy on him
will be implicated in the theft.

427
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,380
Carry on, Mr. Hornblower.

428
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,020
Enough!

429
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,780
Enough, I say!

430
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,980
I think the lesson is well-taken.
From this day forth,

431
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,620
the next man stealing food
from the hold shall hang

432
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,300
from the yardarm.

433
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,000
Mr. Hornblower, about
these new quarters…

434
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,500
Well, sir, it's a pretty
sight from here,

435
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,120
but a closer inspection will show
that the eye is deceived.

436
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,880
-Sir?
-You'll soon regret volunteering,
Mr. Hornblower.

437
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:18,220
I doubt that, sir.

438
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:21,100
Right sir, lay alongside the jetty
there would you?

439
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:23,720
Very good sir.
One and two steady.

440
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,980
Lay on your oars. Toss your oars.

441
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,199
What do we do now, sir?

442
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,100
We wait. Our presence has been noted.

443
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,801
Steady.

444
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,700
Rig that sail so it gives us some
shade, Matthews.

445
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,401
What the…?
Stop him! Stop that man!

446
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,000
Have you lost all sense, man?

447
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:31,620
Theft, and now desertion?
Are you determined to hang?

448
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,900
The captain will decide your fate.
Secure him in the boat.

449
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,620
I will not live with injustice!

450
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,380
Wait!

451
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,220
If he makes another sound, gag him.

452
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,580
Aye, aye, sir.
Bring him aboard!

453
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,720
I fancy he would be at home here
amongst the heathen.

454
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,100
Oh no, look at that.

455
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,699
Looks like a man who's taken
a drink, sir.

456
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,720
-Muslims don't drink, Styles.
-It's illegal, unlawful

457
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:26,680
and impossible to obtain.

458
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,680
He's managed somehow, sir.

459
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,520
His majesty's consul, I believe.

460
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,699
Your servant, Mr. Duras.
May I present acting lieutenant,

461
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,800
Horatio Hornblower,
of the frigate Indefatigable.

462
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
May I introduce the treasurer of
his highness,

463
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:10,199
here to fetch the gold.

464
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,820
The gold, sir, is there, in the
sternsheets of the longboat.

465
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,100
You will have a closer view
of it when we have

466
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:20,100
a closer view of the stores.

467
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,380
Now, the gold.

468
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,620
-Mr. Hornblower.
-Very good, sir.

469
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,220
-Bring out the gold, Matthews.
-Aye, aye, sir.

470
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,700
-Well, Cook?
-Very good, effendi.

471
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,620
Are you unwell sir?

472
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,980
It's this infernal heat.

473
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Sir, what's happening here?

474
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,980
-Oh my goodness.
- What is it, sir?

475
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,020
It's the plague, Hornblower.
It's the Black Death.

476
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,100
The Plague!

477
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,020
Stand still there!

478
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Marines!  Stand to!

479
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,600
Charge bayonets!

480
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,210
-I must report this to the ship.
-The fleet won't have us back,

481
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:23,400
not until we've served three
weeks of quarantine.

482
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,720
Now, that is three weeks after
the last case has occurred.

483
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:29,840
-We shall have to stay here in Oran.
-Nonsense, no one

484
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:32,680
-would order that.
-Have you seen an epidemic
in the Fleet?

485
00:50:32,681 --> 00:50:35,000
Have you seen 9 out of 10 men

486
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:38,620
die of putrid fevers, Mr. Hornblower?

487
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,500
I have.

488
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:43,620
I have seen the Plague
in Smyrna in '86.

489
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:48,620
Now, no captain would run that risk
for a crew of twenty men.

490
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,699
We have been here for hours.
We have been

491
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,610
close to that.  To him.
To hear him speak.

492
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:58,600
-To catch his breath.
-Control yourself, Mr. Tapling.

493
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:01,400
-Which of us will be first?
-Please, bite your tongue

494
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:03,920
-for the sake of the men.
-And, there is the fleet.

495
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:06,440
Those supplies would have
been a godsend.

496
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:09,241
Darn it,we can do something about it.

497
00:51:21,642 --> 00:51:23,600
Mr. Bowles!

498
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,620
-What is it?
-I must speak to the captain!

499
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,620
Come aboard and speak to him, then.
What's going on?

500
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,600
Please tell the captain
I must speak to him.

501
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,620
-Mr. Hornblower…
-Bad news, I'm afraid, sir.

502
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,299
The Black Death is at Oran.
It could only

503
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,620
-have struck today, sir
-Then they are already dead, sir.

504
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,920
Enough of that!
Keep to leeward, Mr. Hornblower.

505
00:51:46,921 --> 00:51:49,620
Aye, aye sir.
I have a suggestion, sir.

506
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
-Yes, what is it?
-The fleet needs the supplies, sir.

507
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,200
We could serve our three weeks
at sea

508
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:56,799
-on the Caroline to preserve them.
-Waste of time, sir.

509
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,620
One moment, Mr. Hornblower.
You have something to say…

510
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:01,800
Like as not, they'll all be dead
in a week

511
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:04,099
-and you'll lose the Caroline.
-True, but I must weigh

512
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,620
that fact against the chance
of supplies, Mr. Bracegirdle,

513
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,300
and at this moment, that is of

514
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:12,600
far greater importance to this fleet.

515
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,400
Very well. I appoint you in command
of the Caroline.

516
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:16,999
Thank-you, sir.

517
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,380
-Where's Mr. Tapling?
-He's ashore, sir;with the marines.

518
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,200
-He may continue as your passenger.
-Very good, sir. And sir?

519
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,600
-Yes, what now?
-My books, sir.

520
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,620
-Books?
-For my examination, sir.

521
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,220
Yes. Right.
See to it.

522
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,620
I hope...

523
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,380
-I hope you find time to study them.
-Thank-you, sir.

524
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,099
She's like the blooming
Noah's Ark, sir.

525
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,699
Noah's animals walked in two by two
Matthews.We're not so lucky

526
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,800
And we have to get the grain
on board first.

527
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,699
Now, rig those tackles there.

528
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,780
Rig tackles!
Step alive, there!

529
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,220
He'll be all right.

530
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:05,620
Man the capstan and get us underway,
if you please, Mr. Bowles.

531
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,380
Good-luck, Mr. Hornblower.

532
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,620
Report in three weeks at Gibraltar.

533
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,700
Very good, sir.  Thank-you, sir!

534
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,620
Beg 'pardon, sir,

535
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,620
Can't you hear those
cattle bellowing?

536
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,620
- It's terrible hot. They need water.
-Darn.

537
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,120
We'll never be able to get them
on board before nightfall.

538
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:38,550
Very well, Styles.
Take some men from the loading

539
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:41,899
-and get the water set up.
-Aye, aye Captain.

540
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,620
Easy, Matthews.

541
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,700
We can't control the flow, sir.

542
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,300
That's enough.

543
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,500
We'll start afresh on the morrow.

544
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:33,620
Well done, men.
Thank-you for your efforts.

545
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,600
Well, Bunting, was this

546
00:55:57,601 --> 00:56:00,699
what you had in mind when
you made your bid for freedom?

547
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,220
Please, spare me the wise words.

548
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,500
You're short of crew and
you need my help … SIR.

549
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,620
It's you who needs my help, Bunting.

550
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,600
You have a choice.

551
00:56:17,601 --> 00:56:20,350
You can lie here and rot until
we reach Gibraltar,at which time

552
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:23,699
-you will answer for your crimes…
-We'll never see Gibraltar.

553
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,620
…or you can return to your duties.

554
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,420
In which case I might be prepared
to speak for you

555
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,380
-at your trial.
-Why would you speak for me?

556
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,220
Each of us can find
a maggot in our past,

557
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,420
which will happily devour our futures

558
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,620
I give you the chance
to reclaim yours.

559
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,620
What if there is
no future to reclaim?

560
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,620
Then pray that death is swift.

561
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,700
Wait

562
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,300
-I spoke in haste, sir.
-Are you prepared to work?

563
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,180
Yes, sir.

564
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:10,100
Cross me, Bunting,
and you will regret it.

565
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,780
Heave, heave, heave.

566
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:41,881
Ease on the guide there.

567
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,882
Lower away.

568
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:53,883
Steady, steady.

569
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,900
Bring her in. None of that.

570
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:08,101
Heave!  Heave!

571
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,700
We have visitors, sir.

572
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,620
And they carry an
evil breath, Matthews.

573
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,699
-Where's Mr. Tapling?
-He refuses to rise from his bunk,sir

574
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,180
Does he, indeed?

575
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,850
Good morrow, Mr. Tapling.

576
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,100
When can we expect your
presence above decks?

577
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:37,100
Never. There is no point.

578
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:39,499
-The Moors have come to fetch
their gold.
-The Moors?

579
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,620
Don't let them aboard.
Set sail at once.

580
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,450
-The gold is theirs by right.
-I will not see them.

581
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:47,620
-Send one of the men.
-I need my men, Mr. Tapling.

582
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,620
I have pains in my body.
I cannot move.

583
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,620
The hand of death is upon me.

584
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,020
In that case, you shall have
no need for rations.

585
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,520
You would withhold rations
from a dying man?

586
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:02,500
I would consider it my duty

587
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,199
to help speed your release
from this world, sir.

588
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,900
The admiral will hear of this.

589
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,380
And what did they give us in return?

590
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,300
-Last one, men!
-Thank-you, sir.

591
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,999
-What's that smell, Matthews?
-What? Oh, it's the cattle sir.

592
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,899
They haven't got the sense to get
their rear ends over the side

593
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,500
Well, get some men on it.

594
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,920
-Not a job for volunteers, sir.
-No, but at least they're busy.

595
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,299
It takes their minds off
other matters.

596
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,620
There's truth in that, sir.

597
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,620
We'd best get out to sea, away
from this infernal wind.

598
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,599
Get that forecastle bent on.

599
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,020
And then send the hands to stations
for weighing anchor.

600
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,500
Lively now!

601
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,500
What is the meaning of this?

602
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:42,220
A problem, Mr. Tapling?

603
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:45,699
Did you give orders that I should be
assigned cook's mate?

604
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,899
-Are you a carpenter?
-What?

605
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,820
-Or a surgeon?
Are you qualified for that?
-Oh, now look here…

606
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:54,820
We have no need for a wordsmith
on this voyage, Mr. Tapling.

607
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,820
We're short on crew, and
each must pull his weight.

608
01:01:57,821 --> 01:02:00,820
But cook's mate. I am not bred
for such a task.

609
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:04,000
If you can show me a job for which
you are better qualified,

610
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:06,480
I'll consider it.

611
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,699
We should beat a path close up
to the straits, Matthews;

612
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,000
'lest this Westerly and
the current takes us

613
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:20,620
-out of reach of Gibraltar.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

614
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:22,750
She's not cut out for this kind
of work.

615
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:24,920
Let's hope she hangs together.

616
01:02:24,921 --> 01:02:28,100
-And slaughter a bullock for the men.
-A bullock, sir?

617
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:31,899
Each meal might be our last.
Let's ensure it's a feast.

618
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,800
This is, without question,
the most revolting experience

619
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:44,899
of my entire life.

620
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,999
-It has its advantages, sir.
-None that I can see.

621
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,600
The man with the hatchet gets
to pick the choicest cuts.

622
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,380
Indeed.  Show me.

623
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,800
Let us pray

624
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:05,620
that we live in quarantine
for the rest of our lives.

625
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,480
-Does it taste as you remember?
-It does.

626
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,800
There's a certain satisfaction
in seeing

627
01:03:12,801 --> 01:03:14,899
one's efforts appreciated.

628
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,600
Not half as satisfying
as a nice bit of fillet.

629
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,700
Ah, for heaven's sake.

630
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,620
-What do you want?
-It's happened.

631
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,620
What's happened?  Talk sense, man!

632
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,100
The plague.

633
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,620
Get away.  Don't touch him.
Stay away.

634
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,300
Get back.  Huh? Here. Got him, right.

635
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:45,620
-Now, now get him overboard.
-Belay that, Styles!

636
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,200
-But, sir!
-Belay that.  Put that down.

637
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:51,580
I warned you, Hornblower!

638
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:54,180
I warned you this would happen!
We're all dead!

639
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,620
Control yourself, if you please,
Mr. Tapling.

640
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,280
Straighten yourself up, man.

641
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,000
Put him where he belongs

642
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:13,300
in the hold with
the rest of the stinking beasts.

643
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,180
The man is drunk!

644
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,320
Very noble of you, Mr. Hornblower,
I'm sure.

645
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:39,620
-What?
-To risk your life so.

646
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:43,520
There was no risk, Mr. Tapling.
If the man had been carrying

647
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,280
the plague, we were all done for
anyway.

648
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,620
What's up with our guests,
Mr. Matthews?

649
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:25,620
-These animals are thirsty again,sir.
-Then water them.

650
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,020
Trouble is, sir, we have but
three days' water left.

651
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:33,620
Three days?  We've still a week to
serve with the quarantine.

652
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,100
Cattle - thirsty brutes, sir.

653
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,699
Very well.  When the wind picks up,
we'll stand into the coast

654
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,780
and look for a stream in a quiet spot

655
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,620
A small town, about half
a mile inland, sir.

656
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:09,600
Spied a few guards but there's
nothing going to worry you.

657
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,699
They must have followed you.
Over there!

658
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,100
Fire!

659
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,620
Bunting!
Take charge here, Matthews.

660
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,900
Get down.

661
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,520
Get into the trees!
Get into the trees!

662
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:48,020
Don't move!  If you run,
I will kill you.

663
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,880
Then why did you save me?
To hang?

664
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,580
You will return to Gibraltar
to stand trial.

665
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,280
Stand still!

666
01:09:59,281 --> 01:10:02,650
Better the speed of the bullet than
the slow agony of the rope.

667
01:10:02,651 --> 01:10:06,580
If you have your heart set
on dying, I will oblige.

668
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,880
Then do it, and I will be
forever in your debt.

669
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,900
My duty is clear.

670
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,280
Your duty?

671
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,580
To save a man so that he may
be killed more slowly?

672
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,300
You will return with me to the ship.

673
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,400
Never!

674
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:55,380
I believe your duty is fulfilled,sir.

675
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,580
-Three killed, two fled, sir.
-Very good, Matthews.

676
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,550
What of Bunting, sir?

677
01:11:21,551 --> 01:11:24,580
We'll take him aboard
and bury him at sea.

678
01:11:24,581 --> 01:11:29,980
-The man was beyond saving, sir.
-I should have found a way.

679
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,999
-What, for God´s name?
-The Dreadnaught, I believe, sir.

680
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,380
What the heck is that boat doing?

681
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:56,220
They've got a couple of sides
of beef in there, sir!

682
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,100
-Quick, after her!
-Boats crew!

683
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,220
Pull away! Pull for all you're worth!

684
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:25,200
Heave to.  Heave to, God dam you.

685
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,780
Return those supplies to my ship!

686
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:44,580
You have a problem, Mr. Hornblower?

687
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,180
With respect, sir, you have
no right to these supplies.

688
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:51,680
-Indeed! And by whose judgment, sir?
-We are a plague ship, sir

689
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:54,699
I am aware of that, Mr. Hornblower,
but your quarantine's

690
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:57,699
almost over. I am sure you can
spare me a few head of cattle.

691
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,200
The quarantine has a week
to run, sir.

692
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:03,199
We cannot be certain we are clear.
The cattle must be returned

693
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,580
to my ship and these hands should
accompany them.

694
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:09,000
Now, surely you can give me these

695
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:11,600
-two scrawny beasts, Mr.Hornblower.
-My duty is to see that

696
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:14,580
the fleet is protected
from the Black Death, sir!

697
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,580
And what about your duty to
a superior officer, sir?

698
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,880
I know my duty, sir.

699
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,650
And it also lies with the lives
of the men.

700
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:27,650
I will not barter with you,
Mr. Hornblower. You will surrender

701
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:30,880
your supplies or I shall take them
by force, if necessary.

702
01:13:30,881 --> 01:13:34,380
Then the supplies are yours, sir.

703
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:38,900
And the responsibility is yours,also.
Pull for the Caroline.

704
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,620
I will see you in Gibraltar,
Mr. Hornblower.

705
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,300
We therefore commit his body
to the deep, to be turned

706
01:13:52,301 --> 01:13:55,880
into corruption; looking for the
resurrection of the body

707
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,700
when the sea shall give up her dead,
and the life of

708
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,580
the world to come through
our Lord, Jesus Christ;

709
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,500
who, at his Coming, shall change
our vile body that it may be

710
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:11,280
like His glorious body, according to
the mighty working

711
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:16,380
whereby He is able to subdue
all things to Himself.

712
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,020
Amen.

713
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,380
Such a senseless waste of life.

714
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,580
Your grief is admirable, Captain,

715
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:36,080
but I fear you take it
too much to heart.

716
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,300
I killed him, Mr. Tapling.

717
01:14:39,301 --> 01:14:43,480
The man had long since lost
his respect for life, but your

718
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:48,500
courage in command of this ship
will save the lives of many.

719
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,220
I feel certain Captain Pellew
would have found a solution.

720
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:02,980
I fear I must question my readiness
for command.

721
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,280
Well,Captain Hornblower,a sight
to gladden the heart,is it not?

722
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,780
Indeed, Mr. Tapling.

723
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,420
You served us well, sir.

724
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,980
No more than my fair share,
and I gained much in return

725
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,200
a new acquaintance with
the cuts of a bullock,

726
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:30,090
and the worth of full bellies
for the men.

727
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,900
Such knowledge will serve me well.

728
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,480
What is the meaning of
this commotion?

729
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:57,381
There, sir!

730
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,500
Good heavens!

731
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,080
Hello, Noah!  How are Shem and Ham?

732
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:28,600
Shem and Ham have brought home
the supper.

733
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:30,499
Well done, Mr. Hornblower.

734
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:35,100
I regret that Mr. Bracegirdle
can't say the same.

735
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:42,380
Mr. Tapling has already informed me
of the man, Bunting.

736
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:48,000
You carry the weight of his death
on your shoulders.

737
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:53,200
A month ago,
Mr. Bracegirdle bade me test

738
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:56,080
my readiness
for office with the men.

739
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,050
-I failed that test, sir.
-Mr. Hornblower,

740
01:17:00,051 --> 01:17:04,980
men like Bunting choose to cast
themselves adrift.

741
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,180
You attended to your duty as
an officer.

742
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,080
I failed to find a way inside the man

743
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,900
You have nothing to reproach
yourself with.

744
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:18,980
One man has died.
Others may live,

745
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,780
thanks to you.

746
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,080
-Yes, sir,but his death was needless.
-That is the price

747
01:17:25,081 --> 01:17:29,099
of command, I am afraid. And
it doesn't do to dwell on the past

748
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,680
- Besides, you have much to prepare.
- Sir?

749
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:35,350
The examination for lieutenant takes
place tomorrow

750
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:38,980
at Admiralty House.I presume you
still wish to present yourself

751
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,180
Good, then advise Mr.Bracegirdle
that I've given you permission

752
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,980
-to take away one of the ship's boats
-Aye, aye, sir.

753
01:17:44,981 --> 01:17:47,180
That will be all…

754
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:49,780
-One thing more, Mr. Hornblower.
-Sir?

755
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:53,980
I understand you allowed your men
to feast on fresh beef.

756
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,980
In the circumstances,
I thought it best.

757
01:17:56,981 --> 01:18:01,320
You thought it best!
You thought it best, sir!

758
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,180
Fresh beef when there were other
provisions on board?

759
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,800
Wanton extravagance!

760
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:15,900
-I'm surprised at you.
-Sorry, sir.

761
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,100
Good to have you back on board,
Mr. Hornblower.

762
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,880
Can anyone lend me a clean
white shirt?

763
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,780
-What's so funny?
-You can have one of mine, lad.

764
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,399
This will never do.

765
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,420
-I hear the steward has a flatiron.
-Thank-you.

766
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,980
It is not a simple request.
I've got one pair of hands.

767
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,000
I've got better things to do
with my time

768
01:19:39,001 --> 01:19:41,099
than iron your neckerchief,
Mr. Hornblower.

769
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,499
I'll do it myself.
Just give me the iron.

770
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,280
I'll have a queue at my door
every morning.

771
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,100
I'll give you my spirit ration.

772
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,980
Well, at least you won't
disgrace the ship.

773
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,780
Thank-you Mr. Bracegirdle.

774
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,580
My hat!

775
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,980
Well, take it off as soon as
you can and,

776
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,980
carry it under your arm.
Maybe they won't notice.

777
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,980
You're as ready now as you
ever will be.

778
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Thank-you, sir.

779
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:31,980
Here he comes, lads!  Three cheers
for Mr. Hornblower!

780
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,900
And, another three!

781
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:46,380
-Good luck, Mr. Hornblower!
-Good luck, sir.

782
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:16,300
Acting Lieutenant Hornblower,sir,
reporting for the examination

783
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,300
There's forty of us.

784
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:51,700
How many of us will they pass,
do you think?  Five?

785
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,980
Here they come!

786
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,080
Black Charlie Hammond, looking as
if he's lost a guinea

787
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,400
and found a sixpence.
Harvey, of the Dockyard.

788
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,580
And Dreadnaught Foster, no less.

789
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,400
First young gentleman!

790
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,980
Three more months at sea, be darned.

791
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,200
I was told to send the next man.

792
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,099
What did they ask you?

793
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:00,480
They began by asking me to define
a rumb line.

794
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,099
-Rumb line?
-Well, don't keep them waiting,

795
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,980
-I advise you.
-You were there ten minutes.

796
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,000
Forty of us, ten minutes each,

797
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:10,480
why, it will be midnight before
they reach the last of us.

798
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,880
They'll never do it.

799
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:15,300
If time runs out, perhaps they'll
try you in batches,

800
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:17,880
like the French tribunals.

801
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,580
Next!

802
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,180
How did you fare?

803
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,020
Bad luck.

804
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,580
Next!

805
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,180
Well, if it isn't Pellew's young
upstart.

806
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,600
Well, sir?  Report yourself.
We've no time to waste.

807
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,980
H-Hornblower, sir. H - h - Horatio
Hornblower, midshipman.

808
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,980
I mean, acting lieutenant.
Indefatigable.

809
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,720
Certificates, please.

810
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,200
Well, sit yourself down.

811
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,699
You're close-hauled on the port tack,
Mr. Hornblower,

812
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,200
beating up channel with a
nor'easterly wind blowing strong

813
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:03,880
with Dover bearing north two miles.
Is that understood?

814
01:25:04,081 --> 01:25:05,999
Yes, sir.

815
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,300
Now, the wind veers four points,
taking you flat aback.

816
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:12,580
What do you do, sir?  What do you do?

817
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,699
By now you are dismasted.

818
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:23,580
Dismasted, sir. Cliffs of Dover
under your lee.

819
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,220
You're in very serious trouble,
Mr…Hornblower.

820
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,699
Are we to receive the fountain
of your wisdom, Mr. Hornblower.

821
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:41,580
Or did you perhaps leave your tongue
on the plague ship?

822
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:48,580
I…. Dismasted, you say?

823
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,580
Indeed.

824
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,100
Dover… Dover cliffs…

825
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,900
What's going on?

826
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,920
It's a general alarm.  See?

827
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,900
There!

828
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,020
There, sir!  A fire ship!

829
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,480
If it touches a ship, she'll go up
like paper.

830
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,920
-We must get back to our ships.
-They're firing on it, sir!

831
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:55,700
Pray they sink it.
You!  You! Shoreboat,

832
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:58,600
Come along side. Come along side,
blast you!

833
01:26:58,601 --> 01:27:01,281
Come alongside or I'll fire into you.

834
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,580
You, sentry there, make ready
to give them a shot.

835
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:16,481
-Come on Hammond,for God's sake, man.
-Move yourself, sir.

836
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,182
Darn it, Harvey.

837
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,400
For God's sake, what are
you doing, man?

838
01:27:29,401 --> 01:27:31,199
She's heading for the Indefatigable,
sir.

839
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,999
-Pull for the Dreadnaught.
-Darn it, I'm the senior, here.

840
01:27:34,001 --> 01:27:36,420
Pull for the Calypso.

841
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,800
Pull, men, pull!

842
01:27:41,201 --> 01:27:43,601
Pull for your lives!

843
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,200
There she is!

844
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,780
She's swinging right!

845
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,700
Heaven help them aboard there.

846
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,680
-She'll be alongside her in a minute.
-With a man at her wheel,

847
01:27:56,681 --> 01:27:59,780
-she could be steered clear.
-Are you mad?

848
01:27:59,781 --> 01:28:03,480
Sir,nobody could survive on that
-The boy's right,we should try

849
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,400
Pull!  Pull away!

850
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:13,180
Pull away, darn it and you may
live through this! Pull!

851
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,320
The heat is too great to board her.

852
01:28:27,321 --> 01:28:30,320
Now lay her under the counter.
Jump for it.

853
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:33,680
Let me go, sir.
The Indefatigable is my ship.

854
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:37,600
Be my guest, Mr. Hornblower.
Be my guest.

855
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,520
Use spars to fend her off!

856
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,000
Hand pump!

857
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,980
We've got to get to that wheel.

858
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,600
-Here, sir, take this!
-Right.

859
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:18,880
-Hard-a-port.
-The wheel's jammed, sir!

860
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,680
Here, cast off this lashing.
Cast it off.

861
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,800
-Now, hard over!  Hard over!
-Hard over it is, sir.

862
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,900
She's answering the helm, sir!

863
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,700
Fend her off, there!

864
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,980
Our stern will touch her.
Hard-a-lee!  Hard-a-lee!

865
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,820
Hard-a-lee, aye, aye, sir!

866
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,880
Put out that fire!

867
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,400
-Put that fire out!
-Fire on the deck!

868
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:51,980
-Midships!
-Midships, aye, aye, sir.

869
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,520
We'll lay her ashore over
neutral ground.

870
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
The tiller ropes have burnt away,sir,
she can't be steered.

871
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:20,980
Right, Mr. Hornblower.
Abandon ship.

872
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,080
Captain Foster!  Captain Foster!

873
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,900
Save yourself, man.  Jump!

874
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,480
Into the water!

875
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:05,800
Captain Foster!  Captain Foster!

876
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:09,201
Captain!

877
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,999
Mr. Hornblower, are you all right?

878
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,780
A little singed, sir.

879
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,500
Where is the boat? It's supposed
to be following us

880
01:33:22,501 --> 01:33:26,500
-to take us off.
-I can't see it, sir.

881
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:28,800
Ahoy!

882
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,399
Ahoy, Hammond!  Ahoy!

883
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,700
Darn it, they should have been
following us.

884
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,499
Over there, sir!

885
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,380
-Captain Foster!
-Hammond!

886
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,000
We have you, sir.

887
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:48,880
Come on!  Over here!
Quickly, man!

888
01:33:50,181 --> 01:33:51,981
Here, sir.

889
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,900
I'll have your hand, sir.

890
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:59,320
Your hand sir.  Well-done, sir.
Hornblower!

891
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:03,580
-Thank goodness, sir.
-Yes, but no thanks to you, sir.

892
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,280
We followed as fast as we could get
these rock scorpions to row

893
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:10,680
Mr. Hornblower, come aboard, sir.

894
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,580
You were supposed to be following
us to pick us up, sir.

895
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:16,100
I thought at least I could rely on
a brother captain.

896
01:34:16,101 --> 01:34:18,400
-What are you implying, sir?
-I make no implication, sir.

897
01:34:18,401 --> 01:34:20,780
But, others may read implications
into a simple statement

898
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:23,049
-of fact.
-I consider that an offensive
remark,sir.

899
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:25,299
I congratulate you on
your perspicacity, sir.

900
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:28,300
Would you care to withdraw
your statement with an apology?

901
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:30,820
I would not!

902
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,980
Very well.  We will continue this
further when we reach shore.

903
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,280
We will sir, when I shall expect
an apology from you.

904
01:34:38,281 --> 01:34:41,099
My God sir, I will not stand
for this! I shall have recompense

905
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,500
-in a duel at first light.
-I shall look forward to that

906
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:46,099
-with pleasure, sir.
-I shall send a friend to wait on you

907
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,700
He will be most welcome

908
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,480
What are you staring at, man?

909
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,200
Nothing, sir.

910
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,480
My life is in your... debt,
Mr. Hornblower.

911
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,880
But not for long, it would seem, sir.

912
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:21,480
In all my years at sea, I have
witnessed

913
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,480
many an act of courage,but that, sir,
must rank

914
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:29,480
amongst the most memorable.

915
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:35,480
My men owe you their lives, and I

916
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,600
owe you my ship.

917
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,600
These events will be noted
in your records.

918
01:35:43,601 --> 01:35:45,980
Thank-you, sir.

919
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:54,280
Might I inquire about
my examination, sir?

920
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,880
That particular examination Board
may never reassemble,I fancy.

921
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,699
Now look here, Hornblower,
from what Harvey told me, you were

922
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:09,100
flat aback, about to loose your spars
with the Dover Cliffs

923
01:36:09,101 --> 01:36:11,650
under your lee. One more minute,
you would have been failed.

924
01:36:11,651 --> 01:36:14,000
It was the warning gun that saved
you, was it not?

925
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,620
Yes, sir.

926
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,900
I think in the last few weeks
we've seen you face

927
01:36:27,901 --> 01:36:30,920
and pass a much sterner examination.

928
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:34,300
-Sir?
-I think you've tasted
the bitter brew

929
01:36:34,301 --> 01:36:37,199
that is a captain's life.
I think next time, sir,

930
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,180
-you'll be better prepared.
-Yes, sir.

931
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,919
-Mr. Hornblower.
-Sir?

932
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,220
It has been an honour
to serve with you.

933
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,400
And with you, sir.

934
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:03,500
Mr. Hornblower.

935
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,300
Mr. Bracegirdle, sir.

936
01:37:06,301 --> 01:37:08,400
The officers would appreciate
your attendance

937
01:37:08,401 --> 01:37:10,799
in a celebratory tot of rum.

938
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,700
I shall attend presently.

939
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:18,180
Something disturbs your thoughts,
I fancy.

940
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,780
Just thinking of the distances
we travel,

941
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:29,580
and yet how far we've still
to sail as men.
