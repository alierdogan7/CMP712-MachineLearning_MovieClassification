1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,633
1942, THE NETHERLANDS
DURING GERMAN OCCUPATION.

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,435
DUTCH JEWS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED
TO WALK IN PARKS

3
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,712
OR GO TO RESTAURANTS
OR STATE SCHOOLS.

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,799
DEPRIVED OF THEIR FREEDOM AND
SEGREGATED, MOST ACCEPT THEIR FATE

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,709
IN THE HOPE THAT THE HUMILIATION
IS THE WORST THAT WILL HAPPEN.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,999
Tazelaar, I want it started up
by Monday, before noon.

7
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,750
Maintenance can be carried out on C13.

8
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,953
Den Daas.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
- That transfer has been sorted out.
- Thank you.

10
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,637
- Don't forget the doctor's note.
- OK.

11
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,876
Have a nice day.

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,475
Mr Süskind?

13
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,238
The director would like to see you.

14
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,317
Can't it wait till Monday?

15
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,235
Daddy! Daddy!

16
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,431
- Whose birthday is it?
- Mine.

17
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,075
You look so pretty.

18
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,114
OK kids, coats on.
Paul, Saar, Anne, Lou.

19
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,191
You're a bit late.

20
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,789
She is your daughter, you know.

21
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,189
Who needs the toilet?

22
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,671
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,152
- I might as well have stayed in Germany.
- Yes, but you're in Amsterdam now.

24
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,794
But for how long
and where's it all leading?

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,753
To the theatre.
And you're driving the kids there, now.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,035
Without a car?

27
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,189
Yeah...

28
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,118
Then we'll walk.

29
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,793
I leave that stinking country
because of that bastard

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,911
and he follows me!
The son of a bitch.

31
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,953
To pinch your job,
how mean!

32
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,879
Walter, if that's
the worst thing that happens...

33
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,548
Is everyone here?
Come on, sweetheart.

34
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,631
JEWS ONLY

35
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,831
Come on, kids.

36
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,675
- Have you got it with you?
- Yes, back to the Dark Ages.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,958
The Süskind family.

38
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,673
Seven people.

39
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,319
Do you want one, Saartje?
Paul.

40
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,073
- Vreugdenhil, Christiaan?
- Yes.

41
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,833
- Are you in the show too?
- I'm the pianist.

42
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,429
- Jewish?
- No.

43
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,194
- Come with me.
- What's going on? I'm not Jewish.

44
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,234
Officer, you can't treat
Arians like that.

45
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,753
What are you doing here?

46
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,635
I'm here for the revue.
Let him play the piano.

47
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,199
What business is it of yours?

48
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,678
As a German, I'm always proud
of Germans in uniform, like you.

49
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,359
Always correct.

50
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,999
Papers, please.

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,069
Here you are.

52
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,551
- Mr Süskind?
- Yes.

53
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,548
Wait here.

54
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,515
Mister...

55
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,708
A nice piece of rough.

56
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,952
If you want to sell it,
my boss will know what to do with it.

57
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,959
You still have a job?

58
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,799
- You didn't get fired?
- I got lucky.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,197
- You don't have to go to Germany?
- I can stay in Amsterdam.

60
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,914
I've got a Sperre.
Don't ask me why.

61
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,077
- It's not from the Krauts.
- No, the Jewish Council.

62
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,989
- Get your white rag, sorted.
- Can you get one just like that?

63
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,232
Well, not just like that...

64
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,477
- You probably have to work for them.
- What are you worrying about?

65
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,716
If you can earn a living,
here in Amsterdam

66
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,151
and ride your bike here and breathe
the air here, in Amsterdam...

67
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,438
You can wipe your arse
with that rag for all I care.

68
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,074
At least I don't have to go
to Krautland.

69
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,478
Simon, come on.

70
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,428
What are you doing here,
where do you live?

71
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,198
What are you sitting there for?

72
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,109
- Come here, you're driving me crazy.
- There was a stone in my shoe.

73
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,317
Watch out, a cop!

74
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,792
- Papers, please.
- I live here.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,513
Roos! Roos, come here!

76
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,835
- Go away, Roos.
- Shut up!

77
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,668
Go away, you stinking Jew!

78
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,029
Daddy!

79
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,477
Some day the war will end.

80
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,948
And then she will go to school,
and she will live

81
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,593
and she will get married.

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,719
And we will be
a grandpa and grandma.

83
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,638
You'll make a great grandpa.

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,755
Hanna,
will you promise me something?

85
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,595
Will you stay with me always?

86
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,949
Whatever happens?

87
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,877
JEWISH COUNCIL

88
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,031
Excuse me, excuse me.

89
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,235
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

90
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,954
Good morning.

91
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,630
You're already here, Mr Polak.
It may take a while, but follow me.

92
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,915
Thank you.

93
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,959
To be honest, I don't see myself
in some German factory.

94
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,516
- You'll be exempted, surely.
- As long as you're indispensable here.

95
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,349
You, me...
Now, where was I?

96
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,236
Ah, Dr Tugendhaft and his family,
they can be removed.

97
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,869
Doctors really are indispensable.

98
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,671
We're lucky the gentlemen are allowed
to choose who has to be deported.

99
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,995
- Not the Germans?
- No.

100
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,272
They just say how many.
We're free to choose who.

101
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,516
Imagine getting
a summons to report.

102
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,429
- You could not report in.
- Then they'll come and get you.

103
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,988
Miss Elzas, am I mistaken
or is that someone new?

104
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,754
That's Mr Polak from the Expo.
He is here for the lists.

105
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,915
Ah, the lists!

106
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,271
Guess how many we've managed
to remove from the list.

107
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,914
Bram, perhaps Mr Polak
doesn't like riddles?

108
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,590
14,000, all of them a Sperre.
Who would have thought?

109
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,758
Did you expect that, Mr Polak?
Be honest.

110
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,037
No. Ten, maybe.
Twelve, at the most.

111
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,151
This morning,
we had coffee with the SS.

112
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,510
Excellent coffee,
I must say.

113
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,713
- Suddenly, that Mr Aus der Fünten asks...
- Hauptsturmführer Aus der Fünten.

114
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,832
He asks how many people
the Council needs

115
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,759
to get everyone on the train
within a year.

116
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,155
That's what he says.
I say twenty thousand.

117
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,359
Once a businessman always a businessman.
You ask for 20, you get 14.

118
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,028
Like rats, Mr Asscher.
We're walking into the trap like rats.

119
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,918
Mr Kisch,
this really is the only way.

120
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,033
A slippery slope.
Do we want to become the Nazis' slaves?

121
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,037
- Is that our mission?
- Adapting.

122
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,350
We've survived
for 2,000 years by adapting.

123
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,989
This could, God forbid,
be the last time.

124
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,589
- Please sit down, Mr Kisch.
- Sit down?

125
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
Is your name on there, Mr Polak?

126
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,514
Süskind is my name, Walter Süskind.

127
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,789
Sluzker.

128
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
And you would like to be removed?
I understand.

129
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,990
But I'm afraid I can't help you.
Sorry.

130
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,550
Listen, you should know
I have considerable work experience.

131
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,354
A ship with 1,000 passengers
has sprung a leak

132
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,552
and there is only room
for 50 in the lifeboat.

133
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,359
What about the other 950?

134
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,075
They're just allowed to perish?

135
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,637
I worked at Krupp.
And since '38 at Hoogovens.

136
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,110
You'll see, I'll be indispensable here
within a week.

137
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,075
As a pianist?

138
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,632
I can tap dance too.
I'm a company manager, a good one.

139
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,469
DUTCH THEATRE

140
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,113
157,694 cards.

141
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,319
The German way.
Double-entry bookkeeping.

142
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,199
There's a card
for every name on the list.

143
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,874
Watertight.

144
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,358
Felix.

145
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,633
Felix Halverstad.
After the war he'll be an artist again.

146
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,516
They wait here for transportation
to Westerbork camp.

147
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,395
- Can't they go straight there?
- 140,000 people on a train in one go?

148
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,154
You send them twice a week,

149
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,715
400 or 500 people at a time.

150
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,239
Here is the toilet.

151
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,190
One toilet? Do you know how much
waste matter a family produces in a day?

152
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,756
- Times 400 or 500 families...
- No families or children here.

153
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,315
The Germans don't like whining.

154
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,715
- Where do you keep them then?
- There.

155
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,151
- In the synagogue?
- That's where the children are housed.

156
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,153
Get rid of the Torah
and you've got a crèche.

157
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,277
The SS are certainly resourceful.

158
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,597
So the children are separated
from the parents upon arrival?

159
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,917
- And brought here, yes.
- The slippery slope.

160
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,356
You can still refuse the position
and return the armband.

161
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,313
We'll see you here anyway.
Your child here.

162
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,195
You across the street with your wife
in the front row stalls. Let me know.

163
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,118
What do you want with that?

164
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,151
To escape. Hide.

165
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,756
Have you gone mad? If they catch us,
they'll send us to Mauthausen.

166
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,748
Is that what you want? Your daughter
in a prison camp? Hiding is forbidden!

167
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,671
Walter, I'm so proud of you.
We've got a Sperre.

168
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,792
Yes, if I take that job
as the Nazi's stooge.

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,231
If you don't, there'll be ten others
who will. Twenty, a hundred.

170
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,078
- Someone has to do it.
- Why?

171
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,840
Why must we leave?
We're ordinary Dutch citizens.

172
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,510
- Maybe you can petition the Queen.
- As if she cares about a few Jews.

173
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,752
Do you know what will happen
if you don't take that job?

174
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,076
- Police!
- Get lost!

175
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,354
Out the back!

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,070
Come on, run!

177
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,594
Up there!

178
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,439
- Roos.
- Simon, grab my hand.

179
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,999
- Look at me. Let go.
- Come on.

180
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,118
- Stay where you are!
- Simon, go on. Roos, stay with him.

181
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,992
- Mummy!
- Mummy!

182
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,316
Run! Run!

183
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,350
Good morning.
Will you be eating at home this evening?

184
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,669
No. Thank you.

185
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,037
Half-blind. Lower jaw gone.

186
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,477
- Are you still a human being then?
- What are you talking about?

187
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,671
Helmut. My brother.

188
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,598
- The Eastern Front?
- Yes.

189
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,873
He was awarded
the Iron Cross First Class.

190
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,394
- A hero.
- Yes.

191
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,393
Quite different from those here who are
dragging our honour through the mud.

192
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,312
To the Central Bureau?

193
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,393
- And then on to the theatre.
- Yes, sir!

194
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,153
What were our orders? How were we going
to take care of this task?

195
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,316
Do you remember?

196
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,515
Well?

197
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,676
Quickly, orderly, thoroughly.

198
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,319
How? Rottenführer?

199
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,154
Teutonically, Herr Sturmbannführer.

200
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,718
It may not have dawned on you yet
but we're not the Salvation Army.

201
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,957
Beating people up in the street,
is that Teutonic?

202
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,878
An officer shouldn't berate his men.

203
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,469
Even when they're beating
helpless people to death?

204
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,513
People?
Symptoms of decay.

205
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,594
I'm warning you, once more

206
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,479
and you'll be going
where your brother went.

207
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,075
Together we face the task
of making things run smoothly here.

208
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,793
And prevent worse happening.

209
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,594
We all know who and what
we have to be on the alert for.

210
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,469
Tolerate them like you would a storm.
You can't do much about that either.

211
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,119
Achtung!

212
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,199
With discipline and hard work,
we can fulfil our honourable task.

213
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,508
Hauptsturmführer, may I introduce you
to Mr Walter Süskind?

214
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,508
He has been appointed
by the Council to take charge here.

215
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,393
Ladies and gentlemen.

216
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,030
You must execute your tasks here
with efficiency and dedication.

217
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,313
There are certain rules to be adhered
to. Rule number one: Teutonic regime.

218
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,511
Disorder will be severely punished.

219
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,958
Rule number two: Tears or other displays
of emotion will not be tolerated.

220
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,436
Rule number three: Tough action
will be taken against all attempts

221
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,916
to fraudulently obtain privileges
for family or friends.

222
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,470
It is in everyone's interest
that this operation

223
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,519
proceeds flawlessly
and is concluded within ten months.

224
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,234
Heil Hitler!

225
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,675
Would you come and report like that?

226
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,193
So meekly and obediently?

227
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,789
That's easy for you to say,
people are scared.

228
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,718
They should have burned the registers.

229
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,270
Instead they just hand them
to the Krauts. "Here, 150,000 Jews."

230
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,712
Working in Germany...

231
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,869
<i>I'm a godforsaken Pollsh pagan,</i>

232
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,749
<i>Worth less than nothlng,
the Muselmann...</i>

233
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,198
<i>They klck me here,
they klck me there.</i>

234
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,351
Schoontje Schelvis?
What a lovely name!

235
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,278
- And what's his name?
- Bram.

236
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,469
To a labour camp?

237
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,956
He can't even walk yet!

238
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,913
A clean nappy first,
and then a sleep?

239
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,394
Sir. That's enough now, stop.

240
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,791
Have you registered yet?
Can I see your summons?

241
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,472
Sir, please stop.

242
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,716
Listen, that's enough.

243
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,915
Sir?

244
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,597
I want you to stop. No, no.

245
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,473
Do you have to?

246
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,796
- Let me go, you bastard!
- May I have your keys?

247
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,276
- Calm down, calm down.
- What?

248
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,988
- What happened?
- Mrs Waterman, may I have your keys?

249
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,599
Your keys.

250
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,676
That's it.
Are you alone?

251
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,752
Madam, are you alone?
Husband? Children?

252
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,188
Disciplinary case.

253
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,472
- Don't you speak Dutch?
- Better than you, you filthy Kraut!

254
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,114
Probably went into hiding.

255
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,710
Rations halved
and immediate deportation.

256
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,798
I have to get out of here.
Listen, my children...

257
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,874
My children!

258
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,713
- We're getting quite Teutonic already.
- Yes.

259
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,833
- What does that really mean?
- Something very German.

260
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,957
Yes, war.

261
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,317
With people like you,
you don't even have to be anti-Semitic.

262
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,552
- Shall I pray with you?
- Get lost. I don't pray, ever.

263
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,389
- So you're not Jewish?
- Oh, so why am I here then?

264
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,555
No-one knows.

265
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,030
Can I ask you something?
What's there to sing about?

266
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,753
Have you got a better idea?

267
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,793
Nice catch.

268
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,951
- Did he eat well?
- Yes.

269
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,878
Time to have a sleep.

270
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,718
Bye, Mummy.

271
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,632
- He's mine.
- Of course he is.

272
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,519
You can come and feed him twice a day,
but now you have to go.

273
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,557
No! I want to keep him with me.

274
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,555
Stop her. Stop her.

275
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,155
Schoontje, listen.

276
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,038
No, they're taking my child away!

277
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,513
Calm down. Soon you'll be on the train
with Bram in your arms. I promise.

278
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,239
OK? I promise.

279
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,237
- I promise.
- Come on.

280
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,518
- Mr Süskind?
- What?

281
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,236
Do you know where they're going?

282
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,715
- Westerbork.
- Yes, but after that?

283
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,433
To work in Germany.

284
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,315
What? What else?

285
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,876
No idea. But it stinks.

286
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,358
- You have to let me go.
- Madam.

287
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,518
- My children are wandering the streets.
- Please, leave.

288
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,874
Stop it.

289
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,069
Stop it, stop it!

290
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,714
- And just leave them?
- They should be in the crèche.

291
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,629
Crèche, my arse! Are you sending
your kids to Germany to work?

292
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,149
Do you have any idea how old they are?

293
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,394
Mum?

294
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,669
Mummy?

295
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,591
Why isn't she here?

296
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,793
Please knock in future.

297
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,033
What are you doing?

298
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,758
Are you going to grass on me?

299
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,949
Idiot.

300
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,032
Double-entry bookkeeping.

301
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,879
The disciplinary cases
are marked on the cards too.

302
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,713
I know. This is only half of the work.

303
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,354
Oh, you want me to play the hero too?

304
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,836
You've got the key.
To the file room.

305
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,154
Felix...

306
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,436
Why did you take this lousy job?

307
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,193
Like you...
to save my skin.

308
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,193
Yes. And that's all you can save.

309
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,515
Walter.

310
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,112
Do you think I'm not afraid?

311
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,629
You shouldn't have become a Jew then.

312
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,274
- What are you doing? She's on the roof!
- Who?

313
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,271
I want him back!

314
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,752
I want my child back now!

315
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,395
Bram!

316
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,394
Get her down off the roof. Quickly.

317
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,229
Müller! Get her down from there,
using any means.

318
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,192
Bram! Bram!

319
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,149
You don't seem to have understood me.
Rule one?

320
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,356
- I tried...
- Rule one?

321
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,470
Teutonic regime,
Herr Hauptsturmführer.

322
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,029
Under no circumstances
will I tolerate chaos.

323
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,430
It was an accident.
How could I stop it?

324
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,631
Your theatre, your responsibility.

325
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,634
Why?

326
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,354
What have they done wrong?

327
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,794
They exist.

328
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,439
I'm scared.

329
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,916
That's exactly what they want.

330
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,590
Where did such hatred come from?

331
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,514
- Because of what we are?
- No.

332
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,756
Because of what they think we are.

333
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,474
Because of what we teach them.

334
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,070
About the pure and impure.

335
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,557
That there is a dividing line

336
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,876
between what is acceptable

337
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,871
and what is unacceptable.

338
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,109
My bed!

339
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,710
- Who are you?
- That's my bed!

340
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,479
Is that your bed?

341
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,195
You know what?
Come and get it, come on.

342
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,751
- Don't.
- Come on.

343
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,433
Simon!

344
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,355
- Come here, you.
- Let me go!

345
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,194
Let him go!

346
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,628
- No, don't!
- Bastard!

347
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,115
What are you doing,
you little Jewish bitch?

348
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,794
This is the deportation material
for tonight?

349
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,639
- 412 people.
- We'll have to increase that.

350
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,430
Double it, multiply it by ten!
Do you have enough workers?

351
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,393
Absolutely, I have a fine team.

352
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,675
Thank you.

353
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,950
Hauptsturmführer,
may I ask you something?

354
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,195
Go ahead.

355
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,798
Where do they go?

356
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,797
I mean, after Westerbork?

357
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,749
My responsibility ends when the train
leaves. That's all I can tell you.

358
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,197
The Jews owe us their labour,
while our own men are fighting the war.

359
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,109
So Germany will have the Jews
to thank for its eventual victory?

360
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,148
Hauptsturmführer,
I have found a discrepancy, a 'D'.

361
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,199
A disciplinary case, which is
on the card but not on the list.

362
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,912
Arrest them. All of them!

363
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,075
Yes, sir!

364
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,317
Death to Jews! Death to Jews!

365
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,468
Off to Mauthausen with the lot of you.

366
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,032
Unless you suddenly remember the name.

367
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,755
Who messed with the list?

368
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,954
Herr Hauptsturmführer, I assure you I do
not tolerate sabotage or falsification.

369
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,549
But it might be a mistake,
we're only human.

370
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,994
That's bullshit.

371
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,113
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't punish your 'mistake'.

372
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,719
Mr Süskind...

373
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,671
What would I achieve?

374
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,713
Order.

375
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,913
Without me, you choose chaos.

376
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,429
Because I remove one small cog
from the machine?

377
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,270
Your machine will go on working.
I'm easy to replace.

378
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,038
But there is one difference.

379
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,835
You can trust me.
I'm German.

380
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,077
- Meaning?
- I'm a businessman.

381
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,999
A realist.

382
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,118
So I take a realistic approach.

383
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,756
I've had a German upbringing,
went to a German school.

384
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,316
I acknowledge you as my superior.

385
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,949
Herr Hauptsturmführer,
let me do my job.

386
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,312
Mr Süskind?
Just so we're clear.

387
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,949
One more 'mistake'
and you'll be on the train.

388
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,559
With your family.

389
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,069
My God, I thought I was going to die.

390
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,468
I was treated correctly.

391
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,558
- He probably likes me.
- An SS man?

392
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,069
Maybe he's fallen for me.

393
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,993
- But what happened?
- Oh, nothing. That arrogant idiot!

394
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,472
Mr Halverstad. The dimwit. The big hero
with his ink against a gang of crooks.

395
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,831
- Calm down. It all ended well.
- Yeah.

396
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,111
There's someone ill back there,
over on the side. Go and see.

397
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,438
392, 393, 394,

398
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,714
395, 396, 397.

399
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,472
Keep your hands off me.

400
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,033
- Come with us!
- Scumbag!

401
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,033
Look!

402
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,676
Mummy! Mummy!

403
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,798
Roos! Simon!

404
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,678
I said be quiet.

405
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,837
Simon! Let me go!

406
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,434
- Are you deaf? Be quiet!
- Let go of me. Simon!

407
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,151
That smells good.

408
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,793
I'm Uncle Walter.

409
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,433
And you?

410
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,348
- I'm Roos and that's Simon.
- Hi Simon.

411
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,475
No papers, nothing.
Is it alright if they stay here?

412
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,954
- What happened?
- It was that bully from Puls.

413
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,876
- The key man.
- You'll just have to sleep here.

414
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,475
Key men aren't allowed in here.

415
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,033
Goodnight.

416
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,753
Uncle Walter?

417
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,710
Where are they taking Mummy?

418
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,354
I wanted to thank you.

419
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,549
What for?

420
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,075
For not grassing on me.

421
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,879
And I want to apologise.

422
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,554
- I'm an idiot.
- Yes.

423
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,193
Just do your job.

424
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,591
- Yes, sir!
- Other hand.

425
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,679
Let them perish.

426
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,115
- We're safe in the lifeboat.
- Darling.

427
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,709
If I could just have saved one of them.

428
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,634
Are we going into hiding then?
Until it's all over.

429
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,679
And there's no-one left.
I can hear God berating me.

430
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,348
- What do you mean?
- That it's unacceptable

431
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,353
that a distinction is made
between pure and impure.

432
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,872
Don't try to be a hero, Walter.

433
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,998
How am I going to explain to her later
that I got rid of 100,000 people?

434
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,236
And God knows
where they end up.

435
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,915
What about us?

436
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,832
Is there nobody who can help us?

437
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,149
God?

438
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,790
- We'll have to manage on our own.
- Without God.

439
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,598
But I've got you.

440
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,793
Haven't I?

441
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,799
Do what you have to do.

442
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,476
- Piet.
- Walter.

443
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,636
- Glad you came.
- Right.

444
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,157
Cor, I'll have another one.

445
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,439
I'm listening.

446
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,998
No heroics, no violence, no weapons.
Never. Not with those kids.

447
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,720
The problem of
those index cards remains.

448
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,717
Yes, we know all about that.

449
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,118
But a chain is only as strong as
its weakest link.

450
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,232
Aus der Fünten.
Unscrupulous, a lout.

451
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,675
A bastard maybe. But as lonely as hell.

452
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,950
Why do you think he drinks?

453
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,513
They're all lonely?

454
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,472
Why do you think I'm still here?

455
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,955
I talk to him as one Kraut to another.

456
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,230
He gives me every opportunity

457
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,512
to convince him he's an arsehole
if he doesn't let me stay.

458
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,914
Listen...

459
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,513
Can I exchange this
for brandy and cigars?

460
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,349
Good stuff,
not that rotgut.

461
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,232
Ask Old Cor.

462
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,232
The sergeant is a good cop.
They do exist.

463
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,956
- What'll you do with the brandy?
- Soothe, conciliate, placate, win over.

464
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,310
- Aus der Fünten.
- And where does that get us?

465
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,830
It diverts his attention.
If he thinks I'm his friend...

466
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,600
A bastard like that?
No chance.

467
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,951
Do we want to get those kids
out of there or not?

468
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,034
It'll be fine.

469
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,070
One, two, three, four.

470
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,235
Don't!

471
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,597
What do you think you're doing?
Waking little kids up!

472
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:21,354
380, 381, 382, 384.

473
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:27,908
385, 386, 387, 389.

474
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,272
- My compliments, Süskind. Well done.
- Thank you.

475
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,639
With a kiss from David.

476
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,513
I'd rather keep him with me.
It's nearly his birthday.

477
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,517
He'll be in good hands,
I promise you.

478
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,677
You obviously don't have children.

479
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,909
Mrs Groenteman...

480
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,113
You'll be reunited after the war.
He can stay with farmers in Friesland.

481
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,395
- It's about your son.
- We're young and strong.

482
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,989
And quite capable of looking
after our own child.

483
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,236
- Even in a labour camp?
- No is no.

484
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,510
Just get on with your work, miss.

485
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,152
Just get on with your work...

486
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,835
You did your best.

487
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,638
But what about that child?

488
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,035
- Conciliate.
- Conciliate?

489
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,549
Aus der Fünten, he's across the street.

490
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,312
- At the crèche?
- Yes.

491
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,398
He brought a baby.

492
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,551
I'm telling you, this place is only
for Jewish children.

493
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,877
From now on every abandoned child
is considered Jewish.

494
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,952
I'm willing to bet you
she is Jewish.

495
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,599
Mr Süskind.

496
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,995
That went well yesterday.
My compliments.

497
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,475
Incredible.
What an unnatural mother!

498
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,200
Abandoning such a beautiful baby.

499
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,436
Typical Jewish behaviour.

500
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,319
- She doesn't look Jewish at all.
- What is Jewish?

501
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,595
Bauer.

502
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,398
It's all in here. Scientifically.

503
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,716
Does anyone have a tape measure?

504
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,472
You forgot her nose.

505
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,349
One hundred percent.
I knew it.

506
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,589
She can stay.

507
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,798
Perhaps a little toast
to a happy ending?

508
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,474
Why are you looking at me like that?

509
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,717
It's been a long time since I had
a drink with a fellow countryman.

510
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,599
So, what's a German
doing in Amsterdam?

511
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,992
- My grandparents were from Holland.
- I see.

512
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,918
Aren't you homesick?

513
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,549
Thank you.

514
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,192
Believe it or not, but until I was 23
I never smoked, never drank. Not a drop!

515
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,153
We were all for nature,
for purity.

516
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,471
Sleeping under the stars
on a bed of pine needles.

517
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,750
Dreaming and philosophising.

518
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,275
We wanted to change the world.

519
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,719
And we have done too.

520
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,588
<i>I once had a comrade</i>

521
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,828
<i>You'd never flnd a better one</i>

522
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,397
<i>The drum beat for battle</i>

523
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,752
<i>He marched by my slde</i>

524
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,879
<i>We kept In step</i>

525
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,914
<i>We kept In step</i>

526
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,829
<i>A bullet flew towards us</i>

527
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,430
<i>Is It for me or for hlm?</i>

528
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,916
<i>It took away hls life</i>

529
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,197
<i>Now he's lylng at my feet</i>

530
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,437
<i>As if he's part of me</i>

531
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,950
<i>As if he's part of me</i>

532
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,989
Those Russians are tigers.
The Krauts don't stand a chance.

533
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,430
I want to go to Sienna.
Walter?

534
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,556
And to Florence, the Ponte Vecchio!

535
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,438
The war's not over yet.

536
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,591
It nearly is. Not long now.

537
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,839
I know this really sweet hotel
in Sienna, II Fiore di Dante.

538
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,678
They have homemade fig jam.

539
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,030
Delicious. But darling...

540
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,195
I can't leave.

541
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,274
Not yet.

542
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,115
Yes, they're for you.
Hold on. Like this.

543
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,393
Here you go.

544
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,154
PASS

545
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,349
Thirteen stamps.
We did it! We did it!

546
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,959
You have to stay here,
but won't be deported.

547
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,152
- Thank you.
- I'll tell the Haupsturmführer.

548
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,398
That is unacceptable.
Do something about it.

549
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,513
Roos and Simon Waterman,
thank God.

550
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,149
- Where will they go?
- Hindeloopen.

551
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,193
- Hello.
- One, two, three, four, five.

552
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,309
Coats.

553
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,519
Hurry up!

554
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,837
Are we staying here?

555
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,277
- No, you'll take the train later.
- With that cop?

556
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,952
Wait a minute.

557
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,233
Is there a problem?

558
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,512
- That little boy can't come. I'm sorry.
- Why? He can't go back.

559
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,280
- He'll have to.
- But his card's been destroyed.

560
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,914
Nobody will dare take him.
Look at his face.

561
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,758
His face?

562
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,872
- What's wrong with it?
- These people are risking their lives.

563
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,116
I'm not leaving him on his own!

564
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,959
These are dark days, young lady.

565
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,798
Too Jewish? Meshuga!

566
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,470
That may be so, but if they do
a check we're all in big trouble.

567
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,560
You want him to sit in there all day?

568
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,709
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

569
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,670
- Up here is perfect.
- That's the first place they'll look.

570
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,953
- It's absurd.
- But it's true. And there will be more.

571
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,915
That's just crazy! Ridiculous!

572
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,072
Watch your fingers!

573
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,474
No, Walter.

574
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,516
But where shall we put them?
There's nowhere they can go, dammit.

575
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,514
What's over there?

576
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,836
A college.

577
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,832
Mr Van Hulst?

578
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,396
Miss Pimentel.

579
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,797
You're from the theatre, aren't you?
Mr Süskind?

580
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,753
Yes. I wanted to ask you something.

581
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,909
I knew you'd come and see me one day.
And not via the front door.

582
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,715
Your shed.

583
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,590
Could we use it?

584
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,556
It's an emergency, I take it?

585
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,959
A half-empty train.

586
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,997
Do you know how much that costs?

587
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,997
It is beyond my control.

588
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,590
- How many people have you got here?
- Almost 400.

589
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,597
Almost 400?

590
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,794
'I am sorry, mein Führer,
but the war will have to wait a while.

591
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,195
My esteemed colleague
made a mistake.'

592
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,709
- I can't do magic.
- You can't count either.

593
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,230
400 Jews are 400 Jews

594
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,715
and not almost 400.

595
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,431
How many orphans do you have right now?
Without parents across the street.

596
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,153
- Hardly any.
- How many?

597
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,359
- With her, thirteen.
- That will just be enough.

598
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,596
Please, they're just children.

599
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,997
Jewish children. Tomorrow's enemy.
Wrap them up warm.

600
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,428
All thirteen?

601
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,393
And get a move on.

602
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,558
It's beyond my control.
Believe me, I don't want this either.

603
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,557
Then don't do it
if you don't want to.

604
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,268
- I have to, it's an order.
- Do what you can.

605
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,870
If Berlin orders 400
and I only send 387

606
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,310
what do you think will happen?

607
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,398
To me? To the Central Bureau?

608
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,635
And to her?

609
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,710
What does the German war industry want?

610
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,957
A civilised country
doesn't make children work in factories.

611
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,116
Families have to stay together.

612
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,520
- And the numbers have to add up.
- Exactly.

613
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,038
Vigeveno, Lea.

614
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,638
- Vigeveno, Isaac.
- That's me.

615
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,071
- De Vries, Salomon.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,638
Flessedrager, Zwaantje.

617
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,316
I have a proposition, Mr Süskind.

618
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,433
Your choice. It's up to you.

619
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,631
Either the children...

620
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,599
or...

621
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,033
My mother worked as
a cleaning woman for Mrs Kohn.

622
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,869
Her husband was a, what do you call it,
the singer in the synagogue?

623
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,638
- Hazzan.
- Hazzan.

624
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,717
I must have been seven, eight years old
when I heard the Jew Kohn sing.

625
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,919
Wonderful!

626
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,917
I wanted to sing like that too.

627
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,590
Do you feel that too sometimes...

628
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,116
a sadness
that makes you happy?

629
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,998
Do you know that feeling?

630
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,875
Yes.

631
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,713
How is he today?

632
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,232
- Who?
- Mr Kohn?

633
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,273
We're not barbarians.

634
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,909
Such a beautiful orchestra.

635
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,714
Maybe we should
send the children after all?

636
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:33,272
I'm having a little celebration
on Friday.

637
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:36,507
I would value your presence.

638
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:39,623
Me?

639
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,262
It's very informal.
Just me and a few friends.

640
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,429
Thank you.

641
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,511
For inviting me.

642
00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:49,352
But, you see...

643
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:51,912
My wife is a little anxious.

644
00:55:52,154 --> 00:55:53,872
What can happen?

645
00:55:54,074 --> 00:55:57,510
I personally guarantee your safety,
and your family's too,

646
00:55:57,714 --> 00:55:59,625
you can have that in black and white.

647
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,984
Well, see you this Friday then.

648
00:56:05,114 --> 00:56:08,106
Old Cor sends his regards.
For your friend.

649
00:56:08,314 --> 00:56:09,827
- He makes me sick.
- Bastard.

650
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:10,989
But our bastard.

651
00:56:11,194 --> 00:56:13,344
Ours? Who's going
to his birthday party?

652
00:56:13,554 --> 00:56:16,022
- You're a hero.
- I don't want a hero, but a husband.

653
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:19,544
How many have we managed to get away?
50, 80 children?

654
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:23,064
338.
338 human lives.

655
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:27,712
And how many have I put on the trucks?
40,000 or 50,000?

656
00:56:27,914 --> 00:56:29,142
You can't think like that.

657
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:31,390
I see all those scared faces
in the dark.

658
00:56:31,594 --> 00:56:33,664
OK, fine.

659
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:36,434
So stop. But then no more children
will get away.

660
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,752
It's up to you.

661
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:44,111
- I'd like you to leave now.
- Hanna.

662
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,987
Or I'll go.

663
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,227
Where to?

664
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:50,832
Just bugger off!

665
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:53,946
- There's an art to exaggerating.
- Why would they?

666
00:56:55,354 --> 00:56:59,825
"The forced labour of the Jews turns out
to be systematic extermination."

667
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:02,389
- English propaganda.
- I hope you're right.

668
00:57:11,034 --> 00:57:13,502
Five stars. Thank you.

669
00:57:14,114 --> 00:57:16,503
Many thanks, dear... Walter.

670
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,989
- May I call you Walter?
- Of course.

671
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:25,385
You and I are in the same boat.
You didn't know that, did you?

672
00:57:29,794 --> 00:57:35,027
When this is over, when the place is
cleansed of Jews, we can both go east.

673
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,953
You to work in Poland,
me to the Front in Russia.

674
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,464
- May I ask you something about that?
- Do you know what that means?

675
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:43,392
- The Eastern Front?
- No.

676
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,866
You're nothing but cannon fodder.

677
00:57:47,074 --> 00:57:49,542
Until you're blown to pieces.

678
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:55,911
Sorry, Walter.

679
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:58,748
It's all a bit much at the moment.

680
00:57:58,954 --> 00:58:01,593
And on my birthday, of all days...

681
00:58:03,154 --> 00:58:05,304
I got a letter from my sister.

682
00:58:06,394 --> 00:58:08,191
- Do you have any brothers?
- Yes.

683
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:10,669
I don't any more.

684
00:58:10,874 --> 00:58:12,353
Sunday...

685
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:16,664
Helmut hanged himself.

686
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:20,989
God!

687
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:25,432
- Here.
- No. Thank you. I'm alright.

688
00:58:27,194 --> 00:58:28,468
This damned war!

689
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:33,589
If it weren't for the war,
we might very well be friends.

690
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:38,145
- Yes.
- Really good friends.

691
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,703
Welcome.

692
00:58:54,914 --> 00:58:56,950
Good evening, Mrs Hirschfeld.

693
00:58:59,074 --> 00:59:01,668
Fancy coming pheasant hunting?
They're everywhere.

694
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:03,751
- Albert!
- Ferdi. Happy birthday.

695
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:04,943
Thanks.

696
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:09,262
I heard about your brother.
Your sister must be very upset.

697
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:11,103
Yes.

698
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,786
- War is war.
- And a drink is a drink.

699
00:59:14,994 --> 00:59:18,304
Don't worry. They won't
be sending you to the Volga!

700
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,629
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

701
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:22,787
If only it was going as smoothly
all over Europe as here.

702
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:26,031
- It's a pleasure to watch.
- Thanks to our theatre manager.

703
00:59:26,194 --> 00:59:28,503
Mr Süskind, Obersturmführer Gemmeker.

704
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:30,944
Commandant of
Westerbork Transition Camp.

705
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:34,271
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you. Excuse me.

706
00:59:40,234 --> 00:59:41,986
For your wife.

707
00:59:42,194 --> 00:59:44,185
- Thank you.
- Sylvie?

708
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:47,587
And this is for you!

709
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,465
Have fun, Walter.

710
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,029
I...

711
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:06,112
- Sylvie, you should know...
- You are shy, aren't you?

712
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:11,752
A high-up...

713
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,833
but not SS, right?

714
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:17,353
Not really.

715
01:00:18,674 --> 01:00:20,232
But you are German.

716
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:25,186
A sweet, shy Kraut.

717
01:00:27,714 --> 01:00:29,670
A horny Kraut?

718
01:00:47,594 --> 01:00:49,824
Please, don't do that.

719
01:00:50,434 --> 01:00:53,107
Yes, very high up!

720
01:00:56,434 --> 01:00:57,833
I'm married, Sylvie.

721
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:02,186
Are you? So am I.
I won't wear you out, you know.

722
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:19,789
You have guts. I've seen
some meshuga things in my time...

723
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:22,467
That's why I'm not with the SS.

724
01:01:28,234 --> 01:01:32,705
Don't worry, sweetie.
I'm not going to grass on you.

725
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:44,947
All the girls here are.

726
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,668
And Mrs Hirschfeld. Madame.

727
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:52,346
In exchange for a Sperre.
Seems to make the Krauts extra horny.

728
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:07,105
Now, are we going
to do anything or not?

729
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:09,589
Don't then.

730
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:13,344
So why did you come here?

731
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:22,783
From our civilised gentleman?

732
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,143
Hung like a mouse.

733
01:02:32,434 --> 01:02:34,026
'To whom it may concern.

734
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:39,393
Walter Süskind has always been
a loyal servant of the Third Reich.'

735
01:02:39,594 --> 01:02:40,947
Well, well.

736
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:46,427
'Who has supported the SS
above and beyond the call of duty.'

737
01:02:47,594 --> 01:02:48,629
Period.

738
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:51,951
'Neither he nor his family
should be impeded in any way.'

739
01:02:52,674 --> 01:02:53,743
Period.

740
01:02:53,954 --> 01:02:58,869
'Signed Ferdinand Aus der Fünten,
Commander of the SiPo and the SD.'

741
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:02,908
- Bloody hell! Are you his bumboy?
- His what?

742
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:05,787
Traitor! Get the hell away from me!

743
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:08,309
Licking that scum's arse for a Sperre.

744
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:10,505
- And you then? Nazi whore.
- Yeah, right.

745
01:03:10,674 --> 01:03:12,551
Otherwise I'd be sitting
on a cloud now.

746
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:15,547
Just like my grandma, parents,
sister, nieces...

747
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,870
The whole street, taken away.

748
01:03:18,074 --> 01:03:20,429
- They'll come home after the war.
- You think?

749
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:23,273
You should hear your Kraut friends
when they're pissed.

750
01:03:23,474 --> 01:03:26,147
- What are you on about?
- They're never coming back.

751
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:29,505
- They only have to work.
- Oh yeah? Completely naked?

752
01:03:29,714 --> 01:03:32,706
Men and women,
mothers with their children?

753
01:03:32,954 --> 01:03:35,787
They make you take your clothes off.
And then...

754
01:03:35,994 --> 01:03:37,586
Then what?

755
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:40,354
In the shower. They say.

756
01:03:42,874 --> 01:03:44,626
Except no water comes out.

757
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:45,823
What then?

758
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,950
What comes out?

759
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,673
What comes out then?

760
01:03:57,354 --> 01:03:58,309
Gas.

761
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:02,383
You too.

762
01:04:03,434 --> 01:04:05,948
You, just as easily. Yes.

763
01:04:06,154 --> 01:04:08,748
- You don't believe me, do you?
- What should I believe?

764
01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:11,991
The lifeboat doesn't exist.
Hanna, you're going to die.

765
01:04:12,194 --> 01:04:14,071
Stop it! What's the matter with you?

766
01:04:14,274 --> 01:04:18,711
I disposed of them. Sent them to their
death. We're just a big heap of offal.

767
01:04:18,954 --> 01:04:21,593
- You, me and Yvonne.
- No!

768
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:25,353
You don't believe me, do you?

769
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:27,428
Look at me.

770
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:29,672
Look at me!

771
01:04:29,874 --> 01:04:32,911
Look at me.
What do you see?

772
01:04:34,194 --> 01:04:35,593
What do you see?

773
01:04:36,994 --> 01:04:38,313
A Kraut.

774
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:41,382
You're a fucking Kraut.

775
01:04:53,634 --> 01:04:55,352
I won't bloody do it.

776
01:04:56,274 --> 01:04:58,026
Sending people away is one thing.

777
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:00,503
But an accessory to murder?
You forgot that bit.

778
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,067
Mr Süskind.
What do you mean?

779
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:05,266
- Hitler is doing what he promised!
- Poland is tough, yes.

780
01:05:05,474 --> 01:05:09,183
There's hunger, people have to work
very hard, there are diseases.

781
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:12,102
Don't bullshit me!
They're being murdered.

782
01:05:12,354 --> 01:05:15,630
Annihilated,
exterminated like... vermin.

783
01:05:15,834 --> 01:05:16,869
Will you stop, please?

784
01:05:17,074 --> 01:05:19,463
That horror story
about gas trucks again?

785
01:05:19,674 --> 01:05:21,187
Where did you get that from?

786
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:24,790
From someone who works
for the SS. A Jewess.

787
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,503
- Who works for the SS?
- A tart! Horizontal collaboration.

788
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:29,669
Bullshit!

789
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:33,827
I've heard of it. By the park.
The brothel run by Ulla Hirschfeld.

790
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:37,026
Even if what she says is true,
what would you have us do?

791
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,067
- What can we do?
- Stop, just stop!

792
01:05:40,274 --> 01:05:42,583
Leave the theatre to the Nazis?

793
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,586
Do something. Let people know!

794
01:05:44,794 --> 01:05:47,786
I wouldn't want panic
to break out in the theatre.

795
01:05:47,994 --> 01:05:51,031
- How many are left in Holland?
- 40 or 50,000?

796
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:54,624
- They're all going to be gassed.
- What do you want them to do?

797
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:57,348
How do I know? Go into hiding!
Do something.

798
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,907
That's forbidden.

799
01:05:59,114 --> 01:06:01,628
Forbidden? Goddammit!
They're wiping us out!

800
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:05,743
People in hiding
are a danger to our community.

801
01:06:05,954 --> 01:06:08,673
It inevitably leads to reprisals.

802
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:10,990
It is our duty
to take care of our people.

803
01:06:11,154 --> 01:06:14,464
Feed them, give them
medical assistance, alleviate the pain.

804
01:06:14,714 --> 01:06:17,467
We cannot, may not, do more.

805
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:20,669
Not I, not you.

806
01:06:23,434 --> 01:06:25,026
A true Humanist.

807
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:27,384
Wasn't Mr Cohen
a professor before the war?

808
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:29,590
- Of Classics.
- I still am, actually.

809
01:06:29,794 --> 01:06:33,912
You're an undertaker for the Nazi's.
That's what you are. I quit.

810
01:06:36,314 --> 01:06:38,623
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- Just carry on?

811
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:40,950
- Yes.
- Do it yourself.

812
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:43,911
You've got the contacts.

813
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:50,554
Why did you think I gave you the job?

814
01:06:51,794 --> 01:06:54,706
Because of your virtuoso piano playing?

815
01:06:58,794 --> 01:07:00,022
So you...

816
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:13,424
- How could you know that I'd...
- That you were so brave? I didn't.

817
01:07:14,074 --> 01:07:16,224
But you have to carry on.

818
01:07:17,114 --> 01:07:19,582
We're doomed anyway. All of us.

819
01:07:39,714 --> 01:07:42,592
Just bomb the shit out of it all.

820
01:07:42,794 --> 01:07:45,706
The theatre, the railway.

821
01:07:45,914 --> 01:07:47,905
Westerbork, Auschwitz.

822
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:50,463
- A few bombs and it's done with.
- Why would they?

823
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:51,663
Damn English.

824
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,984
It's all about winning the war.

825
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:57,504
Why should I care who wins the war
if I won't be there to see it?

826
01:08:07,954 --> 01:08:10,707
I can't stand the sight of them,
I can't bear the language.

827
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,512
Damn Krauts.

828
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:15,226
Shall we get him?

829
01:08:22,554 --> 01:08:24,192
How did they get here?

830
01:08:24,394 --> 01:08:27,431
Mummy wouldn't let me go with her.
Maupie neither.

831
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:41,110
Where am I going to put you, child?

832
01:08:42,514 --> 01:08:43,469
Come on.

833
01:08:50,634 --> 01:08:53,626
- No problem. Everybody wants babies.
- Maupie.

834
01:08:53,834 --> 01:08:56,826
Cute. But please leave
the deliveries to the girls.

835
01:08:57,034 --> 01:08:59,343
- A man with a baby is suspicious.
- But we meet in a bar.

836
01:08:59,554 --> 01:09:02,148
Here? They're Communists,
every one of them.

837
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:05,073
Maupie's got a sister too.
Nine years old, Mirjam.

838
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:09,233
Fine, but nothing too Jewish.
No-one wants them.

839
01:09:09,434 --> 01:09:12,312
Where do I put the girl then?
The shed is full.

840
01:09:12,474 --> 01:09:14,704
Isn't there one with blue eyes?

841
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:18,111
Just less obviously Jewish.
Then she can come with me.

842
01:09:19,914 --> 01:09:21,267
Less Jewish?

843
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:26,705
Come on, little girl, sit here.

844
01:09:27,794 --> 01:09:28,829
Hurry up.

845
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:34,230
Hold on tight. Here we go.

846
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:36,511
Roos!

847
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:39,188
Roos! Roos!

848
01:10:02,434 --> 01:10:03,628
Henneicke Column.

849
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:07,831
Henneicke Column?

850
01:10:08,034 --> 01:10:10,150
Never heard of it.
You wanted to speak to me?

851
01:10:10,394 --> 01:10:13,386
No. Just need you to sign for delivery.

852
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:16,028
- Of what?
- She was in hiding. In Lunteren.

853
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:19,586
And what if I don't sign?

854
01:10:19,794 --> 01:10:22,706
Then I don't get my money, you sod.
That's worth seven-fifty!

855
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:25,064
A reward? Sorry, no chance.

856
01:10:25,274 --> 01:10:29,108
- Then I'll take her to the SD.
- Out of the question. She belongs here.

857
01:10:29,274 --> 01:10:31,344
Now listen to me
very carefully, my friend.

858
01:10:31,554 --> 01:10:33,909
I let you do your bloody work,
so let me do mine.

859
01:10:34,074 --> 01:10:35,189
- You call this work?
- No.

860
01:10:35,394 --> 01:10:38,943
My passion. My work is emptying houses.
Sending stuff to Berlin for auction.

861
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,513
Jews' stuff.

862
01:10:40,674 --> 01:10:42,505
And the money from the 'Jews' stuff'?

863
01:10:42,674 --> 01:10:46,587
Stop whining. It's used to pay
for the trains, of course.

864
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:49,064
They pay for their own transport.

865
01:10:49,794 --> 01:10:52,547
Stay here! Let go of me!

866
01:11:02,394 --> 01:11:04,624
Shoot then! Shoot!

867
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,469
What are you waiting for?
Need me to show you how?

868
01:11:08,314 --> 01:11:09,508
Let go of my gun!

869
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:28,069
Out the way.

870
01:11:32,114 --> 01:11:34,105
Where will they hide next?

871
01:11:54,714 --> 01:11:57,467
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I laugh.

872
01:11:57,674 --> 01:11:59,426
What will happen to Fanny?

873
01:11:59,634 --> 01:12:01,352
What if she talks?

874
01:12:01,554 --> 01:12:03,749
Say something, Walter.
What if they come here?

875
01:12:03,954 --> 01:12:06,787
- Won't happen. You don't know her.
- And you don't know the Gestapo.

876
01:12:07,274 --> 01:12:10,664
Don't be so stupid!
You're a traitor, think about it.

877
01:12:10,874 --> 01:12:12,865
You've taken Aus der Fünten for a ride.

878
01:12:13,074 --> 01:12:14,302
Terrible, isn't it?

879
01:12:14,514 --> 01:12:17,392
You've done enough, you're not God!
Walter the Messiah.

880
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:21,064
- We'll go on holiday.
- We're going into hiding. Now!

881
01:12:21,274 --> 01:12:23,105
They'll arrest everyone. Piet, Felix...

882
01:12:23,314 --> 01:12:26,431
There, Walter the Messiah again!
We have to leave.

883
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:28,546
We've got those stones.

884
01:12:45,674 --> 01:12:47,232
Any news of Fanny?

885
01:12:47,394 --> 01:12:50,830
- She's on the half-four train tomorrow.
- Dammit!

886
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:54,185
- Did she tell them anything?
- Then they'd already be here.

887
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:56,791
How can we get her off there?

888
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:03,544
Pinched from the Central Bureau.

889
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:07,024
An arrest warrant.

890
01:13:07,234 --> 01:13:09,509
- And who will arrest who?
- You, Fanny.

891
01:13:11,234 --> 01:13:15,113
- And they'll fall for that?
- A bit of bluffing, play-acting.

892
01:13:15,274 --> 01:13:18,391
You are a theatre manager,
aren't you?

893
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:20,871
See you tomorrow.

894
01:13:23,514 --> 01:13:24,663
What are you doing?

895
01:13:25,554 --> 01:13:27,624
I'm leaving. With Yvonne!

896
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:30,029
We can still get away.

897
01:13:30,234 --> 01:13:32,111
Help me then!

898
01:13:35,434 --> 01:13:39,109
Before you know it, the Tommies
and the Reds will be here and you...

899
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,782
will still be smoking cigars
with that clown.

900
01:13:41,994 --> 01:13:43,473
He is indispensable.

901
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:45,187
For the saboteurs, yes.

902
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:48,744
She was acting alone. She said she was
trying to get her nephew away.

903
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:51,627
- She's on tomorrow's train.
- As will you be.

904
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:53,825
A one-way ticket to the Caucasus.

905
01:13:55,354 --> 01:13:59,586
I wouldn't do that. Our work here'll be
finished in a month. Cleansed of Jews.

906
01:14:00,114 --> 01:14:01,786
Thanks to me and to this clown.

907
01:14:03,034 --> 01:14:07,073
- He's got you wrapped round his finger.
- I'll give him a good grilling.

908
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:12,548
Really? Don't forget to
wear your velvet gloves.

909
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:16,784
Süskind wouldn't betray me.

910
01:14:17,634 --> 01:14:21,786
GESTAPO
PROTECTIVE CUSTOD Y ORDER

911
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:29,548
Brilliant. That should do it.

912
01:14:29,754 --> 01:14:31,107
Let's hope so.

913
01:14:33,234 --> 01:14:34,428
Philips...

914
01:14:34,634 --> 01:14:36,431
Philips, Fanny. Leave her on there.

915
01:14:36,594 --> 01:14:39,506
- This is from the Central Bureau.
- On the list is on the list.

916
01:14:39,754 --> 01:14:41,472
- An order's an order.
- Westerbork.

917
01:14:41,714 --> 01:14:45,104
No, not Westerbork.
Mauthausen, right away.

918
01:14:45,274 --> 01:14:47,708
The traitor.
She's a criminal.

919
01:14:47,914 --> 01:14:50,667
As are you! Get on the train.
Or do you need help?

920
01:14:50,874 --> 01:14:52,671
- Zimmermann...
- Am I on that list?

921
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:56,105
- I don't care. You can go too.
- D'you know who draws the lists up? Me!

922
01:14:57,114 --> 01:15:00,186
- I do!
- Then I will personally add your name.

923
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:01,986
- What is it?
- Süskind.

924
01:15:02,194 --> 01:15:04,230
And yours, Herr Rottenführer?

925
01:15:09,954 --> 01:15:12,024
Scharführer Schönfeld.

926
01:15:12,234 --> 01:15:15,749
- Now get on the train.
- Scharführer Schönfeld.

927
01:15:15,914 --> 01:15:17,745
Put me on the train if you must.

928
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:20,633
But I can assure you that
you will be on the next one.

929
01:15:20,794 --> 01:15:23,547
And it won't stop at Westerbork.

930
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:27,631
Stop the train!

931
01:15:40,314 --> 01:15:41,269
Thank you.

932
01:15:53,914 --> 01:15:56,553
My compliments.
Well done. Very well done.

933
01:15:56,754 --> 01:15:58,107
What was so urgent?

934
01:15:58,274 --> 01:16:00,026
Your friend.

935
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:03,584
In two days' time
he wants half of all the white armbands,

936
01:16:03,794 --> 01:16:07,104
7,000 people, to be deported.

937
01:16:08,874 --> 01:16:11,832
- They're in a hurry.
- Amsterdam has been cleansed of Jews.

938
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,707
Why have a Jewish Council
if there are no Jews left?

939
01:16:14,914 --> 01:16:21,023
- Cohen protested fiercely, of course?
- Cohen spent the morning with them

940
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:24,271
and managed to get thirty names
scrapped from the list.

941
01:16:24,474 --> 01:16:27,352
Those thirty will get
an exemption letter tomorrow

942
01:16:27,554 --> 01:16:29,863
telling them they don't have to report.

943
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:32,713
Signed by Asscher and Cohen.

944
01:16:34,234 --> 01:16:39,183
You mean can I make 7,000 more letters?
Why? What good will that do them?

945
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:42,113
It'd give them a little extra time.
A glimpse of freedom.

946
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:44,464
The illusion of a choice.

947
01:16:55,154 --> 01:16:57,588
- How many have we got now?
- Over 6,000.

948
01:16:58,554 --> 01:17:01,307
- This trick could cost him his head.
- Who?

949
01:17:01,554 --> 01:17:03,465
Our Hauptsturmführer.

950
01:17:03,674 --> 01:17:05,392
Revenge is sweet.

951
01:17:05,594 --> 01:17:08,904
- I don't really want revenge.
- But he might.

952
01:17:23,474 --> 01:17:24,748
Achtung!

953
01:17:35,114 --> 01:17:39,346
Süskind? Süskind?
Where are my Jews?

954
01:17:41,314 --> 01:17:42,827
You, get up!

955
01:17:44,074 --> 01:17:45,427
Where is Süskind?

956
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:47,704
I asked you a question!

957
01:17:47,954 --> 01:17:49,751
Get them out of here. All of them!

958
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:52,946
Yes, sir! Get out, everybody out!

959
01:17:53,914 --> 01:17:55,188
Out, I said.

960
01:17:55,674 --> 01:17:57,312
Are you deaf? Out!

961
01:17:57,834 --> 01:17:59,233
That's what I'm saying.

962
01:17:59,434 --> 01:18:04,554
Listen, Mr Cohen. I can assure you,
it's a mystery to me too.

963
01:18:04,834 --> 01:18:06,745
Just a moment...

964
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:11,393
My God.

965
01:18:12,794 --> 01:18:15,866
Take two men and
get them all out of there.

966
01:18:16,074 --> 01:18:18,668
- Yes, sir!
- You, come with me. You too.

967
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:31,789
Where's the rest of my 7,000 Jews?

968
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:34,511
I'm waiting for them.

969
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:37,509
It's still early.

970
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:42,551
On your knees!

971
01:18:42,794 --> 01:18:44,068
Hands behind your back.

972
01:19:07,074 --> 01:19:08,348
Hands behind your head.

973
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,984
What will happen
if I pull the trigger now?

974
01:19:20,194 --> 01:19:21,673
Then I'll be gone.

975
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:23,233
I mean, to me.

976
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:27,709
Do you think I will mourn your death?

977
01:19:29,274 --> 01:19:31,071
Yes, I think I would miss you.

978
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,226
You don't have to shoot.

979
01:19:34,434 --> 01:19:37,346
No, I know. I have a will of my own.

980
01:19:37,554 --> 01:19:39,226
I can choose not to shoot.

981
01:19:40,874 --> 01:19:43,388
Or maybe I'll shoot you anyway.

982
01:19:43,594 --> 01:19:45,471
If you kill me

983
01:19:45,674 --> 01:19:49,747
do you really think
those 7,000 will turn up?

984
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:55,752
Dammit!
They'll have my head for this!

985
01:19:55,954 --> 01:19:59,151
You didn't do anything wrong.
It's beyond your control.

986
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:01,385
Tell Sturmbannführer Lages that.

987
01:20:02,834 --> 01:20:06,383
Someone deceived us. Betrayed us.

988
01:20:10,154 --> 01:20:13,829
- Go on. Move.
- Easy, easy.

989
01:20:19,594 --> 01:20:20,629
Faster!

990
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,385
No!

991
01:20:27,914 --> 01:20:29,142
No!

992
01:20:29,714 --> 01:20:30,783
Aaron!

993
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:39,865
Up there!
Stay where you are!

994
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:44,428
Faster!

995
01:21:14,314 --> 01:21:15,667
Sylvie?

996
01:21:25,434 --> 01:21:26,947
Go on.

997
01:21:30,634 --> 01:21:32,226
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

998
01:21:32,394 --> 01:21:33,463
Quietly, eh?

999
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:43,064
Mind your head.
Next one. Come on.

1000
01:21:49,474 --> 01:21:51,669
I'll bring some more in the morning.

1001
01:21:59,554 --> 01:22:01,351
Go to sleep.

1002
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,267
Goodnight.

1003
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:37,907
That clown of yours can now stencil
as many letters as he likes.

1004
01:22:46,914 --> 01:22:48,313
Süskind?

1005
01:22:51,234 --> 01:22:55,068
- It's not true.
- You're a half-wit, Hauptsturmführer.

1006
01:22:57,674 --> 01:22:58,743
A wimp.

1007
01:23:09,754 --> 01:23:11,107
Hello! Open the door!

1008
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,182
Open up.

1009
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:17,383
Open up, police.

1010
01:23:27,874 --> 01:23:30,707
Come on, let's take a look upstairs.

1011
01:23:37,154 --> 01:23:38,382
They've gone.

1012
01:23:39,074 --> 01:23:40,029
They're not here.

1013
01:24:05,834 --> 01:24:09,463
That's dangerous.
You should come inside.

1014
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:11,668
Excuse me.

1015
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:23,152
Sorry. Excuse me.

1016
01:24:23,954 --> 01:24:26,787
- Walter.
- Sylvie?

1017
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:30,943
They picked them all up this morning.
All the girls. Everybody.

1018
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:33,668
Oh no, and the children?

1019
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,673
They're still there.

1020
01:24:52,034 --> 01:24:54,468
- They'll hear us.
- I can't open it.

1021
01:24:57,394 --> 01:25:00,909
I can't let them starve.
I have to go back.

1022
01:25:01,874 --> 01:25:03,023
Back?

1023
01:25:03,554 --> 01:25:05,226
You can't go back.

1024
01:25:06,794 --> 01:25:08,193
I have to.

1025
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:14,790
I know someone who can help me.

1026
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,552
This makes me sick.

1027
01:25:31,754 --> 01:25:33,824
What about these girls?

1028
01:25:34,274 --> 01:25:36,834
What would you choose:
dancing or Poland?

1029
01:25:46,834 --> 01:25:48,552
Our Jewish SS.

1030
01:25:49,714 --> 01:25:51,227
Get back.

1031
01:25:51,754 --> 01:25:55,030
- Well done. Now you won't be deported.
- I said, get back.

1032
01:26:01,434 --> 01:26:03,072
Obersturmführer!

1033
01:26:04,114 --> 01:26:06,264
- The Commandant knows me.
- I don't give a shit!

1034
01:26:06,474 --> 01:26:07,873
Commandant!

1035
01:26:09,394 --> 01:26:11,464
We've met before.
Sorry, but it's urgent.

1036
01:26:12,194 --> 01:26:13,343
Right.

1037
01:26:13,554 --> 01:26:15,306
I'm the theatre manager.

1038
01:26:15,514 --> 01:26:17,664
Hauptsturmführer Aus der Fünten's
birthday?

1039
01:26:18,354 --> 01:26:21,426
- I don't remember.
- In Amsterdam. At Mrs Hirschfeld's.

1040
01:26:23,674 --> 01:26:25,266
Never heard of it. Take him away.

1041
01:26:27,954 --> 01:26:29,182
No.

1042
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,753
Come with me.

1043
01:26:31,514 --> 01:26:32,469
Stop!

1044
01:26:36,034 --> 01:26:37,433
Enough!

1045
01:27:51,154 --> 01:27:53,270
You're Süskind, aren't you?

1046
01:27:55,194 --> 01:27:56,149
Yes.

1047
01:27:56,514 --> 01:27:58,982
There's someone
who wants to talk to you.

1048
01:27:59,194 --> 01:28:01,071
By the latrines.

1049
01:28:03,554 --> 01:28:04,623
OK.

1050
01:28:06,794 --> 01:28:08,944
God bless you.

1051
01:28:31,354 --> 01:28:32,707
Don't ask any questions.

1052
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:35,907
My darling.

1053
01:28:38,114 --> 01:28:39,911
I'll never leave you.

1054
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,593
Sweetheart.

1055
01:28:43,714 --> 01:28:44,783
Where's Yvonne?

1056
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,867
She's asleep.

1057
01:28:49,114 --> 01:28:51,548
- Did he...
- Don't ask any questions.

1058
01:28:55,554 --> 01:28:57,510
We'll always be together.

1059
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:03,273
Forever.

1060
01:29:07,194 --> 01:29:08,468
Listen, Walter.

1061
01:29:09,074 --> 01:29:10,268
Tomorrow...

1062
01:29:11,874 --> 01:29:13,865
You can go to Amsterdam.

1063
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:16,186
In the morning.

1064
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:17,793
No questions.

1065
01:29:18,794 --> 01:29:23,310
He wants Grandma's stones.
He'll give you till midnight tomorrow.

1066
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:27,063
And you?

1067
01:29:29,714 --> 01:29:31,432
I'm staying here.

1068
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,791
But you have to go.

1069
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:42,666
Those children...

1070
01:29:46,034 --> 01:29:47,592
My darling.

1071
01:29:54,114 --> 01:29:55,069
Yes.

1072
01:30:08,714 --> 01:30:12,866
You will be back by midnight.
With Grandma's treasure.

1073
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,986
If you try to cheat me,
they'll be on the very next train.

1074
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:21,582
- And if I don't try to cheat you?
- Then she is yours once more.

1075
01:30:21,794 --> 01:30:23,591
Yours and yours alone.

1076
01:30:25,354 --> 01:30:28,266
Don't worry.
She has a Sperre until further notice.

1077
01:30:29,274 --> 01:30:31,026
Do I have your word?

1078
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:33,383
You have my word.

1079
01:31:45,954 --> 01:31:47,103
Walter.

1080
01:31:47,314 --> 01:31:48,633
Uncle Walter!

1081
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,186
I'll be back before dark.

1082
01:31:58,794 --> 01:32:00,671
Do you think I can take a bath too?

1083
01:32:02,114 --> 01:32:04,150
As long as you keep them quiet.

1084
01:32:10,034 --> 01:32:11,069
And?

1085
01:32:11,274 --> 01:32:12,343
They're safe.

1086
01:32:12,554 --> 01:32:15,193
We have to get them out of there.
And quick.

1087
01:32:16,754 --> 01:32:17,948
PISS OFF!

1088
01:32:33,274 --> 01:32:35,834
Is that enough for 14 children?

1089
01:32:35,994 --> 01:32:38,144
- Plenty.
- The rest are for Gemmeker.

1090
01:32:39,514 --> 01:32:41,584
- What?
- Nothing.

1091
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:43,262
We should hurry.

1092
01:32:45,834 --> 01:32:46,789
You.

1093
01:33:01,954 --> 01:33:02,943
The key man!

1094
01:33:12,714 --> 01:33:14,511
Sallie! Where is Sallie?

1095
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:17,153
Sallie?

1096
01:33:24,234 --> 01:33:26,384
Simon, come on, hurry up!

1097
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:28,713
Close it! Close it!

1098
01:34:25,634 --> 01:34:28,751
- Bloody little Jew! Are you still alive?
- Let go of me!

1099
01:34:39,794 --> 01:34:41,432
What have we here?

1100
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:44,626
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

1101
01:34:45,234 --> 01:34:46,872
That'll bring in a nice amount.

1102
01:34:58,874 --> 01:35:00,068
Walter!

1103
01:35:50,314 --> 01:35:53,829
It'll be alright. Another train
leaves at quarter past nine.

1104
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:57,943
- Everything you need to get away.
- Get away?

1105
01:35:58,154 --> 01:36:01,510
- You have to go underground, Walter.
- And leave Hanna behind?

1106
01:36:01,754 --> 01:36:04,348
A boat leaves tonight.
I'll take you to Katwijk.

1107
01:36:04,594 --> 01:36:07,984
To Katwijk? I need to go to Westerbork,
I gave Gemmeker my word.

1108
01:36:08,234 --> 01:36:10,145
- And he gave you his?
- Yes.

1109
01:36:10,394 --> 01:36:13,750
He gets the diamonds, Hanna gets
a Sperre until further orders.

1110
01:36:13,954 --> 01:36:16,149
Well, it seems the order has been given.

1111
01:36:19,074 --> 01:36:20,223
By who?

1112
01:36:23,034 --> 01:36:26,071
- By who? Why?
- I don't know, but they're on the list.

1113
01:36:28,194 --> 01:36:29,388
Tonight.

1114
01:36:30,074 --> 01:36:32,542
There's a deportation at half past one.

1115
01:37:30,754 --> 01:37:31,789
Bye, kids.

1116
01:37:35,434 --> 01:37:37,072
Sweetie.

1117
01:37:37,714 --> 01:37:38,908
Bye.

1118
01:37:39,114 --> 01:37:40,342
Uncle Walter?

1119
01:37:43,114 --> 01:37:46,789
Hi, little one.
My brave boy.

1120
01:37:49,474 --> 01:37:50,793
Have a good trip.

1121
01:37:50,994 --> 01:37:52,871
- Can I come with you?
- No.

1122
01:37:53,594 --> 01:37:55,312
Where are you going then?

1123
01:37:57,634 --> 01:37:58,862
I don't know.

1124
01:38:04,194 --> 01:38:05,786
AT THE END IS VICTORY!

1125
01:38:13,114 --> 01:38:17,153
- Mummy!
- Essy, here. Essy!

1126
01:38:17,354 --> 01:38:19,310
Mummy!

1127
01:38:39,554 --> 01:38:43,069
- My case. I'm looking for my case.
- Your case is staying here.

1128
01:38:43,274 --> 01:38:45,344
- Excuse me.
- Move along. Go on.

1129
01:38:45,554 --> 01:38:48,114
- Where's the Commandant?
- Go on. Move along!

1130
01:38:53,354 --> 01:38:54,628
Hanna?

1131
01:39:01,314 --> 01:39:03,748
Please, I'm ill.

1132
01:39:04,714 --> 01:39:05,908
Bloody bastard!

1133
01:39:06,314 --> 01:39:07,349
Let go of me!

1134
01:39:25,434 --> 01:39:29,507
- Son of a bitch, learn some discipline!
- He's a human being too!

1135
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:57,544
Mum, where is Mum?

1136
01:40:36,554 --> 01:40:39,114
Mr Süskind? Follow me.

1137
01:40:50,834 --> 01:40:54,144
My wife, where is she?

1138
01:40:55,194 --> 01:40:56,752
And my child?

1139
01:40:57,834 --> 01:41:00,223
Mr Gemmeker, we had a deal.

1140
01:41:01,074 --> 01:41:04,908
- We agreed...
- I know, Mr Süskind.

1141
01:41:05,154 --> 01:41:07,110
It was beyond my control.

1142
01:41:08,634 --> 01:41:10,226
Where is Hanna?

1143
01:41:10,874 --> 01:41:12,785
My wife and my child...

1144
01:41:15,674 --> 01:41:17,107
Hanna!

1145
01:41:18,714 --> 01:41:19,908
Hanna!

1146
01:42:06,714 --> 01:42:08,386
A person can be mistaken.

1147
01:42:11,434 --> 01:42:13,629
I thought we were friends.

1148
01:42:15,554 --> 01:42:16,953
Did you?

1149
01:42:18,034 --> 01:42:20,867
- Did you have Hanna?
- The game is over.

1150
01:42:21,714 --> 01:42:23,830
Please, Ferdinand.

1151
01:42:24,954 --> 01:42:26,307
Please...

1152
01:42:39,474 --> 01:42:41,510
Hanna and Yvonne Süskind.

1153
01:42:41,714 --> 01:42:43,830
Carriage number 14.

1154
01:43:01,954 --> 01:43:03,103
Bloody Kraut!

1155
01:44:35,874 --> 01:44:40,106
HANNA AND YVONNE WERE GASSED
IN AUSCHWITZ ON 24 OCTOBER 1944.

1156
01:44:40,314 --> 01:44:43,909
WALTER PROBABLY DIED
FOUR MONTHS LATER

1157
01:44:44,074 --> 01:44:48,511
ON ONE OF THE DEATH MARCHES
SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL EUROPE.

1158
01:44:48,754 --> 01:44:51,712
DURING THE YEAR HE WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE DUTCH THEATRE,

1159
01:44:51,914 --> 01:44:55,623
WALTER SÜSKIND HELPED SAVE THE
LIVES OF OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE.

1160
01:45:20,354 --> 01:45:21,343
Roos!

1161
01:45:42,954 --> 01:45:43,943
Simon!

1162
01:46:19,234 --> 01:46:24,592
DEDICATED TO ALL THOSE STILL BEING
HUMILIATED AND PERSECUTED TODAY.

1163
01:47:38,714 --> 01:47:41,831
THE CHILDREN FROM THE THEATRE
WERE SAVED AND GREW UP IN FREEDOM.

1164
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:45,071
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE STILL
CAUGHT UP IN THE HORRORS OF WAR.

1165
01:47:45,274 --> 01:47:47,834
WAR CHILD HELPS THESE CHILDREN.
WE SUPPORT THIS CHARITY.
