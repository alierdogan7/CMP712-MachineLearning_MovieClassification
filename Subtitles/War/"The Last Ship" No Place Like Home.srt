00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:04,437
Come in. Anyone? Anybody out there?

00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,906
[Crying]

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,774
We're sick.

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,643
I'm broadcasting in the blind.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,877
Mama?

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,846
- Mama?
- In the blind!

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,848
- [Coughing]
- Mama, please don't fall asleep.

8
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,050
Sam: Mama, we're
gonna get you help.

00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,518
- [Coughs]
- Wake up, mama, please!

10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,421
Jed: Anyone, please? Anyone out there?

11
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,190
Anyone... damn it! [Coughing]

12
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,494
Mama, please don't fall asleep!
Wake up, mama!

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,663
[Echoes] Mama!

You sure you have enough
for the whole crew?

22
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,898
And 50 or 60 more.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,300
When we get home,

24
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,402
we can use this as a vaccine and a cure?

25
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,939
The uninfected will be immunized, and...

26
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,741
The sick can be cured,

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,276
providing they're not too far gone.

28
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,647
After all the failures
and the false starts,

29
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,448
I just feel so...

30
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,950
Happy?

31
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,019
[Exhales sharply]

32
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,488
I can't truly remember the last time

33
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,156
that I felt that emotion.

34
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,059
Still so much to do.
We have to mass produce it,

35
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,261
we have to distribute it.

36
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,131
- Thank God...
- Rachel...

37
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,966
You did it.

38
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,970
Let's enjoy the moment.

40
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,505
I told her how I feel.

41
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,074
I mean... [exhales]

42
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,210
Basically spilled my guts to her.

43
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,480
I mean, sure, I'm spiking
a 104-degree fever,

44
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,416
but still.

45
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,186
"You make me wanna love again."

46
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,888
I actually said that.

47
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,358
And what does she give me? Zip.

48
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:18,530
What I understand about women,
you fit in a shot glass.

49
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,733
I don't need to tell you.

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,068
[Whines]

00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,105
[Indistinct conversations]

52
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,211
Hey, how are you feeling?

53
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,014
I don't get seasick, so...

54
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,716
[Exhales]

55
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,652
I've never seen morning sickness
on a D.D.G. before.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,021
[Exhales] Have you seen a nursery?

57
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,256
[Chuckles] No.

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,226
- [Door opens]
- Form up.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,096
[Sighs]

60
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,100
Okay, here's the deal.

61
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,802
We are presently attempting to make contact

62
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,838
with the infectious disease lab
at Fort Detrick,

63
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,807
as it has just the facility
Dr. Scott requires

64
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,743
for mass producing the cure.

65
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,578
So far we've had no joy.

66
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,714
I'll be honest...

67
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,550
Knowing how deadly this plague
is and how fast it spreads,

68
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,085
I don't have any confidence

69
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,454
that there's gonna be any survivors, so...

70
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,823
That being said,

71
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,158
there's a reason they call it a fort.

72
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,993
And if anyone can hold their own,

73
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,562
it's our friends in the U.S. army.

74
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,897
Master Chief.

75
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,466
Thank you, sir.

76
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,135
I want to address the issue
that's on all of our minds.

77
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,737
On our way up the coast,

78
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,573
our ship will be passing
right by Norfolk... by home.

79
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,243
And our comms team tells us
we could pick up

80
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,979
some orphan signals from random cell towers

81
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,282
or servers still online.

82
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,117
You may even get a phone call

83
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,652
if they've restored power on land.

84
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,656
It's unlikely, but I just
wanna prepare you.

85
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,492
We don't know what to expect
when we get back to the states.

86
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,993
The only way to help the people we love

87
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,029
is to deliver Dr. Scott and the cure

88
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,164
to a secure and workable lab.

89
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,533
Detrick's our best bet,
so that's our mission.

90
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:02,801
All: Aye, sir.

91
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,803
Carry on.

92
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,864
Any station in this net vicinity

93
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,565
of Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.,

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,534
this is U.S.S.<i> Nathan James,</i> over.

95
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,236
Aye, sir.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,271
Captain, S.S.E.S. reports
that the keyhole satellite

97
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,807
will be flying over
our whiskey in 50 seconds.

98
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,809
Unable to steer,

99
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,978
but they did manage to break
the uplink/downlink encryption.

100
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,346
Bringing up the feed now.

101
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,848
[Beeping]

102
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,651
- [Exhales deeply] It's traveling fast.
- Too fast, sir.

103
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,453
There's no one left at home to control it.

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,355
When it gets over the area,

105
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,689
we'll have less than a minute
to capture the images we can.

106
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,524
We just need enough to chart a clear route

107
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,526
from the land to the lab.

108
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,795
We've tapped into one of
the air force's spy satellites

109
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,398
to check the traffic to Fort Detrick.

110
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,901
Well, why not send
your helicopter or drone?

111
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,435
No more fuel.

112
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,504
They spent it all looking for me.

113
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,073
Kara: Satellite passing over us.

114
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,311
[Static]

115
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,913
Mason: Any station...

116
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,117
Come on, give us something.

117
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,185
There it is.

118
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,589
[Beeps]

119
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,357
Home.

120
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,059
That's interstate 70.

121
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,894
If it's clear, it'll get us
all the way to detrick.

122
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,131
There'll be some image blur,
but I'll get you closer, sir.

123
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,866
[Clicks]

124
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,369
That's a mass evacuation.

125
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,505
- Take us north a mile.
- Aye, sir.

126
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,074
[Typing]

127
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,810
Any station this net vicinity of
Fort Detrick U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D.,

128
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,378
this is U.S.S.<i> Nathan James...</i>

129
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,782
That red "X"... Some sort of quarantine?

130
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,284
More like a warning sign to stay away.

131
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,820
Looks like people took it seriously.

132
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,090
Sir, the satellite's approaching
Fort Detrick.

133
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,625
I say again,

134
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,927
anyone at Fort Detrick, please respond.

135
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,430
The laboratory building's
in the center of campus.

136
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,532
Roger that, ma'am. Zooming in.

137
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,072
[Whispers] Oh, my God.

138
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,108
[Normal voice] It's been
completely destroyed.

139
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:27,446
The lab, the containment areas,
the equipment, everything.

140
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,981
Nothing else on the base was burned.

141
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,283
That lab was targeted.

142
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,419
Who would've done that?

143
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,897
Slow down! Slow down!

144
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,366
Stop the car.

145
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,167
Where you goin'?

146
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,770
My family's sick. They need help.

147
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,171
Can't go this way. Turn around.

148
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,273
Please. Please, we're just trying...

149
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,943
- Trying to get to Olympia.
- Olympia can't help you.

150
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,845
Go back where you came from, old man.

151
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,987
[Window whirs]

152
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,997
Get down.

159
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,149
Should we go after 'em?

160
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,820
No. They'll be dead soon.

161
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:49,676
Sir! Sir!

162
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,478
Take a breath. What is it?

163
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:53,680
I caught a new broadcast.
It's another loop.

164
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,615
But this one was updated today.

165
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,951
And there's something you need to hear.

166
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:59,953
Woman:<i> Winds are coming out</i>
<i>of the southwest,</i>

167
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:02,122
<i>and temperatures will reach
50 degrees in Baltimore...</i>

168
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:04,124
How come we're just hearing this now?

169
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,625
Probably a weak F.M. transmitter, sir.

170
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,494
It must've just come into range.

171
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:08,929
<i>There are reports of a fresh
outbreak of the red flu</i>

172
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,564
- <i>in sector 9.</i>
- "Red flu."

173
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:12,032
Is that what they're calling it?

174
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,500
Doesn't do it justice somehow.

175
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:15,468
It's looping around. Here it comes.

176
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:17,504
<i>U.S.S.</i> Nathan James,
<i>we are aware of your mission</i>

- Get them on the line.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,168
Agreed.

- [Door closes]
- We may still be too far out.

190
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:54,040
You let me know as soon as you find out.

191
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,909
Good work, son.

People are waiting for him.
Don't worry, sweetheart.

205
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:31,378
You're gonna make it. You hang in there.

Rachel: Ava?

211
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:49,095
Kelly: We have been through it.

212
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,431
They're at it again.

213
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,066
Quincy: You know that I love you.

214
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,603
Events... they just happen
on a mind of their own...

215
00:10:56,637 --> 00:11:00,106
I know that things are better now.

216
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:02,275
But...

217
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,679
I don't think they'll be the same again.

218
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,652
Hello, Kelly.

219
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:15,689
Hi. Ava, darling, shall we go
and find something to eat?

220
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:17,557
All right.

221
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,395
I'll see you later.

222
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,965
I'll see you later. Bye.

223
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:35,108
She can't forgive me
for what I put them through.

224
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:40,981
To be honest, I don't blame her.

225
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:43,750
Well, when the Captain
finds the right place

226
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:47,754
for us to put ashore,

227
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:50,490
maybe you can all start again

228
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:53,193
on more solid ground.

229
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,765
Captain, I've got Baltimore.

230
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,533
A Mrs. Granderson is on the line.

231
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:01,801
Did you say Granderson?

232
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,970
- Yes, sir.
- Well, put her through.

233
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:05,305
They're trying to use the vidcom,

234
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,140
but so far it can only get audio, sir.

235
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:09,142
- Go ahead, sir.
- This is Tom Chandler,

236
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:12,178
commanding officer of
the U.S.S.<i> Nathan James,</i> over.

237

<i>Captain Chandler.</i>

238
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:17,684
<i>You have no idea how good it is
to hear your voice.</i>

239
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,919
<i>We thought you were lost at sea.</i>

240
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:22,322
No, ma'am, we're alive and well.

241
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,557
- <i>Oh! There you are.</i>
- I got it.

242
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,927
<i>You must be nearby. I'm Amy Granderson.</i>

243
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:32,165
<i>And I suppose an explanation is in order.</i>

244
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,600
<i>As vice-chair of</i>

245
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:36,336
<i>the President's defense policy board,</i>

246
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,072
<i>I was briefed on your
mission to the Arctic.</i>

247
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:42,575
<i>I knew the risks of the coming pandemic,</i>

248
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,881
<i>and I had my daughter
transferred to your ship.</i>

249
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,016
<i>You must forgive me.</i>

250
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,918
No apology needed, ma'am.

251
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:53,853
Your daughter's been an incredible asset.

252
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:56,356
Pleased to hear from you.

253
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,725
We had no word
from the presidential bunker.

254
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:02,729
<i>President Geller invited me underground.</i>

255
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:05,732
<i>I declined. I-I felt the risk was too big</i>

256
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:08,168
<i>to have so much of our civilian
and military command</i>

257
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:13,706
<i>in one confined space.
Unfortunately, I was right.</i>

258
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,809
So the government is gone.

259
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:17,510
<i>For the most part, yes.</i>

260
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,679
<i>Since the bunker went silent,</i>

261
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,282
<i>there has been a breakdown
of infrastructure,</i>

262
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:27,754
<i>general panic, and, of course,
a tremendous loss of life.</i>

263
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:31,424
<i>I have tried to execute a contingency plan</i>

264
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,460
<i>working with the state and local police</i>

265
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:36,029
<i>to create safe zones.</i>

266
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:39,232
<i>We have been hanging on as best we can.</i>

267
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:44,037
<i>And I have been praying
every day for your return.</i>

268
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:51,077
Ma'am, we can be in Baltimore
in the matter of hours.

269
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,812
In the meantime,

270
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:56,483
I'm sure there is someone
you'd like to speak with.

271
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,957
Mom?

272
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,558
<i>Alisha!</i>

273
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:08,094
Mom, I don't... I don't understand...

274
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,296
What are you doing? Where are you?

275
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:15,368
<i>I'm here, darling.
Oh, I knew you were out there.</i>

276
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,770
<i>I just knew it.</i>

277
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,544
- Thorwald.
- [Water splashing]

278
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:29,181
We've intercepted a transmission.

279
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,350
A U.S. Navy ship is due to make
port in a matter of hours

280
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,419
in Baltimore harbor.

281
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:36,321
- What kind of ship?
- I don't know, sir.

282
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:39,058
Well, is it a tug? A destroyer?

283
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,560
A 5,000-sailor aircraft carrier?

284
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,396
The signal was spotty.
All we know is the name.

<i>Nathan James.</i>

286
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:49,268
It's the ship
they've been hailing for weeks.

287
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,203
Granderson's sending out a greeting party.

288
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,574
Well, if they're having a party...

289
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,243
Then let's party.

290
00:14:58,278 --> 00:14:59,611

and a few surviving state troopers.

315

You don't need the masks. We're not sick.

316

323
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,163
Looks like the troopers just got themselves

a couple hundred U.S. sailors.

325
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,701
A few dozen tomahawks, too.

Just fine, now that you're here.

What?

- [Voice breaking]
- Mom?

342
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,331
I had to come see for myself.

343
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,533
Oh, my baby girl.

344
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:10,769
It's her. It's Granderson.

345
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,906
She came out herself.

346
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,144
I am so glad to have you back.

347
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,913
Captain Chandler, thank you.

Thank you for returning my daughter to me.

349
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:26,251
Privilege, ma'am.
We wouldn't be here without her.

Take the shot.

351
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:30,989
Mrs. Granderson,

352
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,457
we really need to get you
back in the vehicle.

353
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,762
She's blocked.

354
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,865
Come. Everyone's eager to meet you.

355
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:44,870
I can take out the fat man.

356
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,739
No! You only have one shot.

357
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,675
- I want her.
- <i>Danny: Nathan James,</i>

358
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,109
<i>looks like we're having
a bit of a family reunion here.</i>

359
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,844
We're headed out with the group.

360
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,780
<i>Sending Lieutenant Norris back
with the V.B.S.S.</i>

361
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:57,015
<i>To update you on the situation
on the ground, sir.</i>

362
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,784
Roger that.

363
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,852
We'll arrange a welcome
for Lieutenant Norris.

364
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,789
Oh, and say "hi" to Mom for us.

365
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,891
Damn it!

366
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,559
I lost her.

367
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,669
Talk to your friends on the inside.

368
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,771
Find out what they're doing here.

369
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:22,341
[Click]

370
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,984
- Man: Let's go!
- [Dog barking in distance]

371
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,019
[Doors close]

372
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:41,227
We were fortunate to find this building.

373
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:43,162
There's only one coal-fired
plant still operational,

374
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,598
and we have a direct line.

375
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,800
Plus, strategically we're
far enough from the city

376
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,435
to avoid infection.

377
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:52,238
You'll be safe here.

378
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:54,040
Come.

379
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,787
Mom, this is amazing.

380
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:09,455
Oh, yes, but it's been a battle.

381
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,723
And who's the enemy?

382
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,958
Warlords, they call themselves.

383
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,360
And recently, they've killed

384
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,729
more people than the actual virus.

385
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:20,166
Do you know they raided
the National Archives?

386
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,667
They actually tried to steal

387
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:24,003
original copies of the Constitution.

388
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:30,476
As if that could take away
who we are as a people.

389
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,078
Captain.

390
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:36,148
I didn't want to broadcast about the virus

391
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:38,684
over an open radio feed, but...

392
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,120
The President told me
that you had the materials

393
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:42,888
to produce a vaccine.

394
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:45,257
Is that true?

395
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,892
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:49,495
We've actually made a little
more progress than that,

397
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:50,796
Mrs. Granderson.

398
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,965
[Inhales sharply]

399
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,000
We have the cure.

400
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,642
Fort Detrick was our first option, too.

401
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,478
They had the lab and all, but, uh,

402
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:08,614
- Thorwald got there first.
- Thorwald.

403
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:11,517
Former Baltimore P.D. turned
self-proclaimed leader

404
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:13,252
of the Warlords.

405
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:16,122
Been a real pain in our ass
since this whole thing started.

406
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:19,692
I shouldn't complain. [Chuckles]

407
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,994
I imagine you've been through
a hell of a time yourselves.

408
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:26,132
Listen, Lieutenant,
last I talked to my wife,

409
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,334
she said was taking
the family to Deer Park.

410
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:29,702
Safe zone. Heard of it.

411
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:31,937
You know if it's still there?

412
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:35,307
There was fighting,
but there are survivors.

413
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,146
I can get you there as soon
as we get you off the ship.

414
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:42,882
- [Click, hiss]
- Ooh! Thanks, Doc.

415
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:44,850
You have no idea how good that felt.

416
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,485
Well, I have some idea.

417
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,820
- Yeah.
- [Click]

418
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:50,856
Man: What were the results of the test...

419
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,292
[Speaks indistinctly]

420
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,094
See, these results are consistent...

421
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:58,731
Now this is the main reason
we chose this building.

422
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:02,001
[Speaking indistinctly]

423
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:06,939
We've worked for months
trying to develop a cure.

424
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,041
But now you're here.

425
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:11,544
[Exhales] It's heavenly.

426
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:23,422
[Clapping]

427
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:54,820
- [Door opens]
- You're not gonna like this, boss.

428
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:59,391
My guy inside Granderson's said
the ship came back with a cure.

429
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:01,727
It could be bullshit.
We've heard this before.

430
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,462
Not from the U.S. Navy.

431
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:05,264
If that's true, Granderson will spread out,

432
00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:08,234
go anywhere she wants.
We will lose the city.

433
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:10,636
We need to get our hands on the cure.

434
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:12,905
It's probably locked away
somewhere on the ship.

435
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:16,408
The only way is to take
Granderson on directly.

436
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,444
We have to take her lab.

437
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:24,984
Rachel: Extraordinary.

438
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:29,288
- Look at her.
- [Speaks indistinctly]

439
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:31,223
She's in love with a toaster.

440
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:32,925
You still haven't made your move yet?

441
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,693
Oh, I've been making my move since Gitmo.

442
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,662
She ain't buying what I'm selling.

443
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,230
I thought once she saved the world,

444
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:40,199
- she'd let loose a little.
- [Chuckles]

445
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,001
Jeter:<i> Nathan James,</i> this is
Vulture One. Do you copy?

446
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:44,203
[Lowered voice] This is her letting loose.

447
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:46,205
I repeat... <i> Nathan James,</i>
this is Vulture One.

448
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:48,073
Do you copy? I can't get through, sir.

449
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:49,808
You won't get a signal here, Master Chief.

450
00:24:49,843 --> 00:24:51,510
The Warlords are jamming
the local frequencies.

451
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:52,978
They have a radio room, sir.

452
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,714
I let the X.O. know where we are.

453
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,150
Ma'am, uh, if that radio room
is still available,

454
00:24:58,218 --> 00:24:59,818
I'd like to get word to my family,

455
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:01,387
see if they're still out there.

456
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:03,722
I think it's time you thought of yourself.

457
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:05,791
Meanwhile, we can work with your team

458
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:09,361
to arrange safe transit here
for your ship's crew.

459
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:12,831
- Due to warlord activity...

Tex.

477
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:07,366
Hey, listen, just wanted to let you know

478
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,068
that I'm heading off.

479
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,703
- Heading off?
- Mm-hmm.

480
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,806
[Huffs] What are you talking about?

481
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,541
I'm moving on.

482
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:20,412
By yourself?

483
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,047
But it's chaos out there.

484
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:23,882
I've seen worse.

485
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,185
And thanks to you, I can
travel wherever I like.

486
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,189
Where will you go?

487
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:32,925
I, uh, got things to take care of.

488
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,795
The young girl whose picture
that you keep in your locket.

489

Among other things, yeah.

490
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,601
Anyway, you seem to have things
plenty well in hand here.

491
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,442

You take care now.

What do you see?

- What happened? Are you on the road?
- Onyx truck stop.

- It's a tire shop downtown.
- We can get you there.

- It's mine now.

from, where did he go?!

- What do you mean?

What kind of man is Captain Chandler?

576
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,135
He's amazing.

577
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,971
Without him, we wouldn't have
gotten through any of this.

578
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,774
So he hasn't the let
the power go to his head?

579
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:19,077
I'm not sure I understand the question.

580
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:24,249
I'm asking if he will still follow orders.

581
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,184
Follow orders from whom?

582
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,889
Mother, what's going on?

583
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:44,247
Michael, have you seen these protocols?

584
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,649
Of course. Why?

585
00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:48,718
Well, Dr. Hamada claims that his treatment

586
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:51,287
prolongs the lives of the infected.

587
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,456
But his whole assumption about the virus

588
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,057
seems to be wrong.

589
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:56,826
[Huffs] I'm just a statistician,

590
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,227
but the data he's given me suggests

591
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,829
- the treatment's working.
- No, that's impossible.

592
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:02,398
- Is something wrong?
- Dr. Hamada,

593
00:32:02,432 --> 00:32:04,200
you're using ribavirin to introduce

594
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:06,235
higher error rates to
the virus' D.N.A. replication.

595
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:07,837
In a chemical cocktail, yes.

596
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,672
Yes, but the pandemic virus is error-free.

597
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:12,041
Your treatment wouldn't have
any positive effect whatsoever.

598
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:15,578
In fact, these dose levels
are highly toxic.

599
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,013
