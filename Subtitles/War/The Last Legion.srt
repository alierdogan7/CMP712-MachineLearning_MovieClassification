1
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:34,048
The legend began
beneath these dark hills

2
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:36,491
and under this same sky.

3
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:40,916
It tells of a sword
of great power,

4
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,902
forged for the conqueror
Julius Caesar.

5
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,247
This weapon was passed down
until it reached

6
00:00:48,313 --> 00:00:53,187
the last of Caesar's noble line,
the emperor Tiberius.

7
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:58,872
On his death. it was hidden away
to keep it from the hands of evil men.

8
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:02,438
For generations.
it lay in a secret place.

9
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:05,522
marked by the sign
of a pentangle.

10
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:09,922
and as it was written.
under the very gaze of Caesar.

11
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,747
I, Ambrosinus, born in Britannia...

12
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,728
was one of many men who sought it.

13
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:22,584
In a time of injustice,

14
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:26,277
I made it my life's task
to find the sword

15
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:29,140
and the one righteous
enough to wield it.

16
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,998
I journeyed far
across the Continent,

17
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:35,656
through the heart of an empire
that ruled half the known world.

18
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:41,921
Now a threatened Rome
was calling back her bravest and best

19
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,973
to defend her boundaries.

20
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,358
GUARD: Make way!

21
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,284
Good to be home,
Commander?

22
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:32,240
Is this what I'm supposed to wear?

23
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,257
I can't even remember
how to put it on.

24
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:37,832
Why ask, Vatrenus, hmm?

25
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:39,788
Why me?

26
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:43,099
because they trust you.
You are a true Roman.

27
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:47,941
besides, 'tis a glorious thing,
they say, to guard the new Caesar.

28
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,261
We held Africa for them
for 10 years,

29
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,994
grew old on their battlefields,

30
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,145
lost good men.

31
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:56,876
What was it all for?

32
00:02:56,946 --> 00:03:00,604
We're soldiers, Aurelius.
Politicians make the decisions.

33
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,711
AURELIUS: Two breeds of men
to be avoided like the pox--

34
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,643
- (blade scrapes)
-...politicians and philosophers.

35
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,512
You know, in Alexandria
they cut off the hand that steals.

36
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:14,538
No, please.

37
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:17,112
Once the hand is off, it's for God
to decide whether you live or die.

38
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,455
Most die.

39
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,702
Batiatus!

40
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,687
Do it outside. It'll make a mess.
blood everywhere.

41
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,903
- Who's this?
- Thief. Caught in the act.

42
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:37,924
I'm not a thief.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,598
Now he's yours, big man.

44
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,099
- One hand or two, Commander?
- Oh, just the one.

45
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,239
(chuckles)

46
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:54,638
No, let me go, please!

47
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,715
I wasn't gonna steal it, I swear to you!
I give you my word.

48
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,102
AURELIUS: Your word?

49
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:01,603
You?

50
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,368
A street boy? A thief?

51
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,003
How can you be
a man of your word?

52
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:07,323
I just wanted to look at it.

53
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,528
I am Aurelianus Caius Antonius,
commander of the Imperial Guard.

54
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:15,192
I am asking you,
do you lie to me?

55
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,456
I would not lie to you.

56
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:27,432
You come back in ten years, boy.

57
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,868
I'll give you your own sword.

58
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:33,437
Now get out.

59
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:38,032
Another worthy foe
vanquished then, Commander.

60
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,806
It's heartening to see
soldiers of Rome display such valor.

61
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,513
Who are you?

62
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,375
One who knows humiliation
to be a poor teacher...

63
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:51,999
for both men and boys.

64
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,386
I smell a philosopher.

65
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:56,052
Are you all right?

66
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:00,834
- Take the boy and go.
- In our own good time.

67
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,513
Heh. He said go, old man.

68
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,812
More than a philosopher, then.

69
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,133
(blowing softly)

70
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,163
How'd he do that?

71
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:41,596
Every time we have goose for dinner,
you do that same old trick.

72
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:42,625
Oh, dear.

73
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,813
Have I done that one before?

74
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:46,385
And I didn't need your help.

75
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,277
(fountain trickling)

76
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,244
Either way, you missed
your Greek lesson.

77
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,741
How come you never told me
you knew how to fight?

78
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,762
Get out of here,
both of you. Go, go!

79
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,620
Let them pass.

80
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,707
- Odoacer.
- Orestes.

81
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:14,370
For ten years
I have supported Rome.

82
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,169
Ten years my warriors

83
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:18,131
- have fought beside your legions.
- Who is that?

84
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:20,025
(whispering)
The commander of the Goths.

85
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,435
ODOACER: So now here I am...

86
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,614
to claim my dues.

87
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,350
And what are your dues, General?

88
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,467
One-third of all Italy.

89
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:27,971
(scoffs)

90
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,668
You think I'm joking?

91
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,851
Is this true, Orestes?
Did you make such a pact?

92
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:36,062
No... how could I promise
what isn't mine to give?

93
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,408
ODOACER: One-third of Italy.

94
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:40,524
That way the alliance continues

95
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:42,391
and your new Caesar

96
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,887
will not topple from his throne
like the others before him.

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,684
I promised you nothing beyond
the reward you were already given.

98
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,654
You've grown so tall, Orestes...

99
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,225
you forget whose shoulders
you stand on.

100
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,636
Romulus, where have you been?

101
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,273
We've been looking everywhere.

102
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:15,701
Ambrosinus, you took him
outside without a guard?!

103
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,270
- You know the danger.
- No, I--

104
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:20,171
It's a fine morning.
We went for a walk. No harm done.

105
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:23,281
You know what
tomorrow holds for him?

106
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,433
For all of us.

107
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,233
I know perfectly well, Orestes.

108
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:29,196
I have as much care
for your son as you have.

109
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,861
What did you say?

110
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,511
You go too far, schoolmaster.

111
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,279
Leave us.

112
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:46,895
Orestes, sometimes I think you
forget he is just a boy.

113
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:50,554
He has your blood in his veins,
bloodline of the Caesars.

114
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,639
He was never just a boy.

115
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:06,167
Mother, in five years
there have been five emperors...

116
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:08,610
and they were all murdered.

117
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,842
What will happen to me?

118
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:20,520
You will be guarded by the best.

119
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:24,888
You will live long and rule wisely.

120
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:41,626
(cheering)

121
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:25,696
My son...

122
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,653
this day you join the immortals.

123
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:06,750
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

124
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,039
(clanks)

125
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,242
Mother, am I now the most
powerful man in the world?

126
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,269
You are.

127
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:15,657
Then why can't I stay out
on the day I am crowned?

128
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,413
What am I to be,
a god or a boy?

129
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:27,054
You are Caesar,
and my Caesar must be protected.

130
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:29,880
but who would harm me?

131
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:32,932
The one you saw,
Odoacer the Goth.

132
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,384
He is our ally.

133
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,079
And you, teacher
of words and numbers,

134
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:39,491
what is the business
of the state to you?

135
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,890
My only concern
is the welfare of your son.

136
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,554
You make concern yourself no longer.

137
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,907
He is Caesar now.

138
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,354
He's still a boy.

139
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,832
Perhaps he still needs me.

140
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,657
Well, your task is over.

141
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:56,999
Leave us. Don't come back.

142
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,130
ORESTES: Romulus...

143
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:16,427
Hail, Caesar.

144
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,577
This is Aurelius,
of the Nova Invicta.

145
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,693
He will command
your personal guard.

146
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,646
May I see your sword, Commander?

147
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,453
He must do everything
to protect me from harm,

148
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:36,798
- must he not, Father?
- Indeed, he must.

149
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,179
To the last breath.

150
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:40,393
And do I have your word on that?

151
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,894
You have his word.

152
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,366
He is sworn to serve you.

153
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,942
Is it so, Commander?

154
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:51,469
Thank you.

155
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:54,560
I only wanted to look at it.

156
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,225
(blade scrapes)

157
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,583
VATRENUS: Open the gate.

158
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,218
AMBROSINUS:
And this is also Caesar's will?

159
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,751
VATRENUS: You've been well rewarded.
Go back where you came from.

160
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:14,214
My crime is putting new ideas
into a young head,

161
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:15,788
teaching a lad to think for himself.

162
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,329
This lad is our emperor.

163
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,699
Which do you serve:
Caesar or your own ideas?

164
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:24,598
"A wise man never asks
what another man serves...

165
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:26,975
...for only his actions
will speak the true answer."

166
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,471
You've read your Seneca.

167
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,627
I find poets as dangerous
as philosophers.

168
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,771
And you...

169
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,442
Where did you get this?

170
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,135
AMBROSINUS:
A long time ago...

171
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:43,421
in another land.

172
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,864
(screams)

173
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,207
...from a man who loved
only power.

174
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:54,144
So you're an adventurer, as well.

175
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:57,900
If I see you again in Rome,
it'll be on the point of my sword.

176
00:12:57,974 --> 00:12:59,805
Take care in the mist, Commander.

177
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:02,751
It may hide what the gods
themselves dare not look upon.

178
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,970
NESTOR: but who will guard
the guardians themselves?

179
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:15,286
Nestor?

180
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,821
Leave us.

181
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,437
A senator.

182
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,812
Well, these sit better on me
than armor ever did.

183
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:27,572
How is it with you, Aurelius?

184
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,690
Oh, a little older...no wiser.

185
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,295
After all these years?

186
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,263
Did you ever marry, have children?

187
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,444
No.

188
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,851
So what do you make of Rome?

189
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,207
Different.

190
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:39,969
Uneasy.

191
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,503
If you're to guard our new Caesar,
keep your wits about you.

192
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:48,264
And come see me. Friends are
a rare commodity these days.

193
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,347
I will.

194
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,843
GUARD: The Goths!
They've betrayed us!

195
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,329
(shouting, swords clashing)

196
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,507
(catapult rumbling)

197
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:21,956
GUARD: You! To the wall!

198
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,106
Commander!

199
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:27,773
Prepare to fire!

200
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,047
Aurelius!

201
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,299
Down!

202
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,432
Defend the Emperor!

203
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,016
Get back, behind! Go! Go!

204
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:48,928
Form wall!

205
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,940
MAN: Over this way!

206
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:04,729
Get back, boy!

207
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,285
Yah!

208
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,392
(yells)

209
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,532
Ugh!

210
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,013
Father!

211
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:48,703
Odoacer wants the boy alive!

212
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:52,400
I'll do my best.

213
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:57,370
(squelches)

214
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,756
Save yourself.

215
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,122
Yah.

216
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,703
(horse whinnies)

217
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,367
Aah!

218
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:49,730
(hooves pounding)

219
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,579
(flies buzzing, fires crackling)

220
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,173
King, the emissary
from Constantinople.

221
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,936
ODOACER: Welcome, Excellency.

222
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,798
The city is ours.

223
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,722
I ask that your empire recognize me

224
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,351
as the sole ruler of Rome
and all her dominions.

225
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:16,467
My emperor is in Constantinople.

226
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,773
I am his eyes and his ears,

227
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,894
but I cannot speak
on his behalf.

228
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,047
Then go and seek his word.

229
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:35,734
Master!

230
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,174
Aurelius! Fetch water.

231
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:44,924
The boy, Caesar--
is he alive?

232
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,630
I couldn't find him.

233
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,503
His mother and father were killed,
as were my men.

234
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,852
How did this happen?

235
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:58,581
Some of your men survived,
that I do know.

236
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,084
Vatrenus was taken prisoner.

237
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,568
There may be others with him, but...

238
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,428
they're to be executed
as an example

239
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,410
to those who would
stand against Odoacer.

240
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,170
(chains rattling)

241
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:25,021
Come to me.

242
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:43,003
Is it for you that
so many people have died?

243
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,741
Such an innocent face.

244
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,753
The blood of the Caesars
flows in his veins.

245
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:52,189
Old Wulfila here
thinks that I should fear you.

246
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:53,871
Is this true?

247
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:57,467
He is the last of the bloodline.
End it now!

248
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,171
Old Rome will die, and we rule!

249
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,325
We?

250
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:02,771
We rule?

251
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,724
Take care, Wulfila.

252
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:08,553
Sometimes your tongue
runs ahead of your brain.

253
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,401
What do you say, boy?

254
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:23,618
Should I be afraid of you?

255
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:27,312
Why is Caesar treated so?

256
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,010
Why is Caesar treated so...

257
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,392
Perhaps Wulfila's right.

258
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,111
Perhaps I should
end this here, right now.

259
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:49,765
Can you see yourself?

260
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:52,431
Can you see your face?

261
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:55,867
What do you see?

262
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:57,504
Do you see a boy?

263
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,523
Or do you see a Caesar?

264
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,027
I see...

265
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:06,045
Tell me.

266
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,933
I see a Caesar.

267
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,795
I am Caesar.

268
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,115
Wrong answer.

269
00:21:21,187 --> 00:21:22,534
Take him away.
Cut his head off.

270
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:27,215
AMBROSINUS: That will be
a grave error, Lord Odoacer.

271
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,146
ODOACER: Who are you?

272
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:32,876
You kill the boy,
you make a martyr of him,

273
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,739
and Caesar's ghost
will haunt you ever after.

274
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,055
Is that so?

275
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,690
- Read the signs.
- What signs?

276
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,196
An omen.

277
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:41,549
Do not mistake it, Odoacer.

278
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,051
(caws)

279
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,921
If you hear one thing,
then hear this.

280
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,936
What now happens in this room
will echo across an empire.

281
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,477
A city may be won by blood.

282
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:50,767
(caws)

283
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:53,722
It takes a man of vision to rule.

284
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,488
All empires are built on blood.

285
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:56,609
People will judge you.

286
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,308
The people will thank the gods
that they survived

287
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:02,008
and serve their new master.

288
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,259
Now, I asked. Who are you?

289
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,689
Will they respect a leader
who's so afraid of a Roman child

290
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:09,264
he had to butcher him?

291
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:18,552
Perhaps the boy is more use to us
alive than dead.

292
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:22,567
Do you want to look a fool?
Kill them both!

293
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:23,918
Fool!

294
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:30,792
Your best hope for the future,
Lord Wulfila, lies in silence!

295
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:34,162
Give me your hand.

296
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,409
(groans)

297
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,597
Now, I ask, who are you?

298
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:02,882
I'm known by many names.

299
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:03,903
Like a thief.

300
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:06,093
Here I'm called Ambrosinus.

301
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,924
The boy will be taken
to the island fortress at Capri.

302
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:26,038
You--you will be his prison guard.

303
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,708
That's your reward.

304
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,026
No harm comes to him
unless I say so.

305
00:23:30,093 --> 00:23:33,817
Not a hair on his head,
you understand me?

306
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:39,822
And take this one, too.

307
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:42,441
I don't trust him.

308
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,252
Someone's here.

309
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:51,407
Where?

310
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,342
Please.

311
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,363
Wait, Aurelius, I know this man.

312
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:03,333
He speaks for the Eastern Empire.

313
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:04,350
Is the boy alive?

314
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:05,772
I saw him in chains.

315
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:07,405
They're taking him to Capri.

316
00:24:07,477 --> 00:24:09,656
I'll find him,
bring him back.

317
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:12,124
From Capri?
That's impossible.

318
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,543
- It's an island, a natural fortress.
- I'll need my men.

319
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:16,820
We've long been allies, Senator.

320
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,323
Free your Caesar.

321
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:22,920
My emperor will give him sanctuary
until it is safe for him to return to Rome.

322
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:42,322
We meet at Fano in six days,
on the beach.

323
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:44,892
If you bring back the boy,
there'll be a boat to take us east.

324
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,102
Six days, then.

325
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:50,639
- To the last breath.
- To the last breath.

326
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,175
What's this?

327
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,124
One of the ambassador's guards.
You'll need help to free your men.

328
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:00,509
These people are our allies.
Use them.

329
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:03,104
(sighs)

330
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:08,124
Follow me.

331
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:19,556
Act as my prisoner.
When I give the signal, try to escape.

332
00:25:19,626 --> 00:25:21,487
You understand
what I've told you, yes?

333
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:25,179
Then do as I've said
and nothing more.

334
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:30,798
(Demetrius groaning)

335
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,744
Uhn!

336
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,772
(spits)

337
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:38,504
Him first.

338
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,484
- Stop!
- (horse neighs)

339
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:44,542
Another prisoner.

340
00:25:48,118 --> 00:25:50,976
I'm to take this one's head
back to Rome,

341
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,056
an assassin sent
to kill Lord Odoacer.

342
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:55,558
(quietly) Go.

343
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:58,483
Uhn! Aah!

344
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:02,629
Get him!

345
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,716
(yells)

346
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,893
(blades ring)

347
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,082
(horse whinnies)

348
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,973
(yelling)

349
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:35,106
Uhn!

350
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:38,123
(swords clanging)

351
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,272
Ambrosinus...

352
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,455
I want to be with them.

353
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:53,802
I want to be with
my mother and father.

354
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,986
You are with them.

355
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,365
They live on in your heart.

356
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,670
You cannot see them,

357
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:03,689
but it's as if you're in one room
and they're in the next.

358
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:06,461
I should have died, too.

359
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:07,577
Not your destiny.

360
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,085
I have no destiny.

361
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,489
Every living creature
has a destiny, be sure of it.

362
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:16,802
but when the pathway gets dark
and it's difficult to see the way...

363
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:19,782
Well...

364
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:22,481
that's why you have me...

365
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:25,122
for all that I'm worth.

366
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:26,689
(raven crowing)

367
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:28,876
Dumb bird. Forgot to feed it.

368
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,477
Pugie. Pugie!

369
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:34,016
I knew it.

370
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:36,911
I knew it was a trick!

371
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:38,358
Shh.

372
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,844
ROMULUS: Is this our destiny,

373
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:01,547
to be prisoners here
for the rest of our lives?

374
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,824
AMBROSINUS: Have faith.

375
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,207
There is a purpose behind all things.

376
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:22,614
- (chuffling)
- Where is he now?

377
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,208
No sign of the Goths.

378
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:25,712
but we should stay close to the river.

379
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,377
The river, yes.

380
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:28,795
They'll have scouts all the way.

381
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,329
- Agreed, so we--
- Mira.

382
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,347
Yes.

383
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,171
What?

384
00:29:37,247 --> 00:29:39,908
My name. Mira.

385
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,112
There's your boat.

386
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:53,596
How d'you want to do this?

387
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,708
If we all go down there,
we'll scare him off.

388
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,347
He'll be gone before we get there.

389
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:07,689
Wait here.

390
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:15,208
He's a woman.

391
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,228
Uhn!

392
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,755
AMBROSINUS: This fortress
was built as a palace

393
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:49,770
by the great emperor Tiberius,
who, it is written,

394
00:30:49,843 --> 00:30:52,121
was a man of great dignity
and bearing--

395
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:54,105
both of which you've inherited.

396
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,327
So my ancestors built my prison.

397
00:30:58,454 --> 00:30:59,866
A prison it is.

398
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,888
You thirsty, boy, hmm?

399
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:10,457
Go on, drink.

400
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,511
Mm?

401
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:14,219
(spits) Drink.

402
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,109
You dare insult me, boy! Huh!?

403
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,126
It is a long way down, no?

404
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,214
How many fingers
will it take you to learn

405
00:31:22,288 --> 00:31:24,884
your fate lies in the palm
of this child's hand,

406
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:26,871
as sure as Odoacer
is your master.

407
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:29,158
Throw this boy to the rocks,
you will follow.

408
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:35,514
When the time comes, boy,

409
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:39,595
I will send you to join
your mother and your father.

410
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:45,215
You.

411
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:48,234
Odoacer said nothing of you.

412
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:50,616
String him up!

413
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:55,876
Hold.

414
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,152
What is this?

415
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,819
Are you some kind of priest?

416
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,168
A sorcerer?

417
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,865
Just a seeker after the truth.

418
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:10,278
You would never understand.

419
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:11,592
Put him up.

420
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,941
(grunts)

421
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:16,889
(Wulfila laughs)

422
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,041
How long is it to climb to the top?

423
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:30,703
BATIATUS:
An hour. Faster coming down.

424
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:33,304
Take up all the wood
we can spare. And rope.

425
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:34,460
You stay on the boat.

426
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:37,382
- You may need me.
- No.

427
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:48,662
The pentangle!

428
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:51,548
Of course, of course, of course!

429
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:53,450
This is the place.

430
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:58,519
The sword!
Tiberius must have brought it here.

431
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,805
And the boy will find it!

432
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:02,926
Romulus!

433
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,405
Ambrosinus?

434
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:05,883
Go to the temple.

435
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:08,194
Look for your ancestor,
Julius Caesar.

436
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:10,308
There is something he guards for you.

437
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,638
Look under the gaze of Caesar!

438
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,779
ROMULUS: Under the gaze of Caesar.

439
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:16,787
I told you to stay on the boat.

440
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:19,486
You will need my help.

441
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:25,882
You know what happens to a soldier
of mine who disobeys an order?

442
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:28,931
Your men are too slow.

443
00:34:30,157 --> 00:34:31,723
Stay out of sight.

444
00:34:34,493 --> 00:34:36,190
I don't see why you take the risk.

445
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:38,626
I serve my emperor.

446
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:42,842
He's your country's ally,
so I am with you.

447
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,638
Where did you learn to fight?

448
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:49,395
I come from Kerala,
in the south of India.

449
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,675
We were taught to fight
like our forefathers.

450
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,756
It is called Kalarippayattu.

451
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,777
When I was 14,
I was at the 7th level.

452
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,379
Out of how many?

453
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,274
Seven.

454
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:03,813
Shall we talk all day, or climb?

455
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,638
Julius Caesar.

456
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,024
"One edge to defend;

457
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:56,370
"one to defeat.

458
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,694
In Britannia was I forged to fit the hand
of he who was destined to rule."

459
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,937
I have work for you.

460
00:36:58,078 --> 00:37:00,388
(winch creaking)

461
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,543
Oh!

462
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:16,863
(cracking)

463
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:25,178
(yells)

464
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:28,332
(screaming)

465
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:40,793
Uhn! Uh!

466
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,909
(snoring softly)

467
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,368
Give me that sword.

468
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,813
Give it to me!

469
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:31,806
Uhn.

470
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,603
- You.
- Only two to rescue an emperor?

471
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,885
More are coming.

472
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,784
- WUKFILA: Caesar!
- The temple!

473
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:47,673
(Wulfila yells)

474
00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:54,261
Yours.

475
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:15,961
(grunts)

476
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:52,703
(gasps)

477
00:39:57,181 --> 00:39:58,713
Uhn!

478
00:39:58,786 --> 00:40:00,769
(thuds, clatters)

479
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:21,331
(head thuds, Wulfila yells)

480
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:46,094
(screams)

481
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,805
(running man yelling)

482
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:16,096
Uagh!

483
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:18,000
(thuds, clatters)

484
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:36,368
Tsk.

485
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:43,242
(swords clashing in distance)

486
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:46,942
AMBROSINUS:
Romulus!

487
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:51,656
You found the sword, boy?

488
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:53,780
Save the emperor!

489
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:55,831
AMBROSINUS:
Where's Caesar's sword?

490
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:58,629
ROMULUS: It's this way!

491
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,281
Get them away.

492
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:05,951
Get them away!

493
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:12,221
(banging on door)

494
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,719
I got it.

495
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,866
Batiatus.

496
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,277
Yours.

497
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:36,338
- Go!
- This way.

498
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:41,260
Get the boy away.

499
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:54,263
(grunting)

500
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,552
(slashes)

501
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:09,780
(gurgles)

502
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,832
(sea birds calling)

503
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:17,647
Roman.

504
00:43:29,448 --> 00:43:32,010
(swords ringing)

505
00:43:36,194 --> 00:43:37,573
(Goths yelling)

506
00:43:43,004 --> 00:43:44,350
Where's the boy?

507
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:45,830
Safe below with the others.

508
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:20,321
You were right, Batiatus.
It is quicker on the way down.

509
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:22,189
(Batiatus laughs)

510
00:44:39,797 --> 00:44:41,780
"One edge to defend;
one to defeat.

511
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:43,715
"In Britannia was I forged

512
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,106
to fit the hand of he
who is destined to rule."

513
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:51,068
Caesar's sword.

514
00:44:52,196 --> 00:44:54,440
That is why it had such power.

515
00:44:57,015 --> 00:44:58,614
Britannia.

516
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:02,474
Gather the men!

517
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,226
Made for a conqueror...

518
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:08,771
Julius Caesar.

519
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:16,983
Caius Julius Caesar
ensis caliburnis.

520
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:19,973
Feel the weight.

521
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,518
This sword carries a prophecy.

522
00:45:50,556 --> 00:45:52,057
Did you see anything...

523
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:53,313
anything written?

524
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:58,552
Then you know all you need to know.

525
00:46:00,064 --> 00:46:01,115
Take it.

526
00:46:03,278 --> 00:46:04,329
It's yours.

527
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:37,195
Welcome, Caesar!

528
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:39,052
Aurelius.

529
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,473
All of you.

530
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:45,002
There is food and drink inside the tent.

531
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:47,474
We need to talk.

532
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:48,528
Alone.

533
00:46:50,272 --> 00:46:51,772
You're safe now.

534
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:53,894
From here you'll be taken
to the Eastern Empire,

535
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:55,631
to Constantinople.

536
00:46:57,566 --> 00:46:59,328
You'll have sanctuary.

537
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:32,213
Uh!

538
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:38,288
The ambassador has heard
from Constantinople.

539
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:40,826
The emperor will not give
sanctuary to the boy.

540
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:44,939
He will not oppose Odoacer
nor offend him.

541
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:46,543
Everything has changed.

542
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:50,208
The day after you left, the garrison of Rome
swore allegiance to Odoacer.

543
00:47:50,277 --> 00:47:52,654
Now the rest of the commanders
have declared.

544
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,132
They all stand with the Goth.

545
00:47:55,096 --> 00:47:56,827
There must be others
still in the field.

546
00:47:57,956 --> 00:47:58,941
What about the Ninth?

547
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:01,512
The Ninth Legion,
they're far to the north in Britannia.

548
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:03,732
For all we know, Britannia
has crumbled into the sea.

549
00:48:03,802 --> 00:48:05,632
Then we must move fast.

550
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:06,715
Can you get me men?

551
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,896
(sighs) Yes, you can keep your rank,
command a new army.

552
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:12,311
Good. Then do it now.

553
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:14,241
We'll drive out the invaders
if I can have 5,000 men--

554
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:16,135
Not for that, Aurelius, I can't do that.

555
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:18,830
Why not? What is it with you, Nestor?

556
00:48:19,703 --> 00:48:22,944
- Odoacer isn't just a barbarian.
- Is he not?

557
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:26,220
No, he's become a politician,
and a very astute one.

558
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:28,751
Now he has the Senate on his side.

559
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:30,040
How many of the Senate?

560
00:48:30,111 --> 00:48:33,506
We have to see things as they are.

561
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:37,909
You're with them.

562
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,204
In time, perhaps,
we can challenge Odoacer, not now.

563
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:50,241
So let's say you give me
this army, Senator.

564
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:52,211
What will you ask for in return?

565
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:54,287
The boy.

566
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:56,060
You mean Caesar?

567
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:58,627
Caesar is a word from the past.

568
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,112
There is no Caesar.

569
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:07,270
AMBASSADOR:
Prepare the horses.

570
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:10,029
Where is the boat?

571
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,885
I said prepare the horses.

572
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,000
Where is the boat to take
the emperor to Constantinople?

573
00:49:23,562 --> 00:49:25,129
I gave you an order. What was it?

574
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,946
Prepare the horses.

575
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,367
Do it.

576
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:36,761
(grunting, laughing)

577
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:39,967
(thuds)

578
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,153
You are a soldier, Aurelius.

579
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:45,237
Leave the politics to me.

580
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:49,258
This is an order.
Give up the boy.

581
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,271
Without the emperor,
there is no Rome.

582
00:49:52,345 --> 00:49:55,357
Then you will run like a dog
until they hunt you down.

583
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:00,300
Commander.

584
00:50:08,857 --> 00:50:10,269
- Get the boy.
- The boy!

585
00:50:10,334 --> 00:50:11,286
Get the boy!

586
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:16,980
Stop, comrades!
We're all Romans!

587
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:17,551
Uhn!

588
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:45,409
(screaming)

589
00:50:52,544 --> 00:50:54,438
(groans)

590
00:50:55,884 --> 00:50:57,866
Rrrah!

591
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:07,889
Vatrenus.

592
00:51:31,348 --> 00:51:33,111
You don't understand, Aurelius.

593
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:34,493
I had to do it.

594
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:42,783
Aurelius, my friend,
if you ever loved me...

595
00:51:44,197 --> 00:51:45,280
For friendship.

596
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:46,306
Uhh...

597
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:48,144
(coughs)

598
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:51,806
Uhn!

599
00:52:01,672 --> 00:52:03,819
Now that the Eastern Empire
has gone over to the Goths,

600
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,650
we have no refuge in Constantinople.

601
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:08,182
Or here.

602
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:09,539
Or in Germania.

603
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,520
Where do we go, then?

604
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:17,691
The Ninth Legion is in Britannia.

605
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:21,932
It's the only way left to us,
north, to find them.

606
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,725
This is not your fight.

607
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:27,940
You're free to go.

608
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:30,346
Go?

609
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:32,535
Where should I go?

610
00:52:32,606 --> 00:52:34,718
I have broken my sacred oath,

611
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,489
killed my commander.

612
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:38,640
I'm like you.

613
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,757
I have no country now.

614
00:52:43,688 --> 00:52:46,031
My road is your road.

615
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:50,873
Commander, where we go
is not your decision to make.

616
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,131
Caesar?

617
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,515
We go north, to Britannia.

618
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:52,303
AMBROSINUS:
beyond that peak is Gaul.

619
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:55,247
by the next full moon,
we'll be in sight of Britannia.

620
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:08,550
(sea bird squawking)

621
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,379
My beloved Britannia!

622
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:04,638
BATIATUS: Nobody alive,
Commander.

623
00:55:06,058 --> 00:55:07,557
There are horses here.

624
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:12,891
After all these years,
it's still happening.

625
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:14,310
Who could have done this?

626
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:15,625
Only one man.

627
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,514
His name is Vortgyn.

628
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:44,280
ROMULUS: What is this place?

629
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:47,076
DEMETRIUS: Hadrian's Wall,
the last fortress of the Empire.

630
00:55:47,142 --> 00:55:49,190
AMBROSINUS:
A monument to Roman law and order.

631
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,058
The Ninth Legion.

632
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,111
We've found them.

633
00:56:16,696 --> 00:56:17,747
Look.

634
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,254
The dragon.

635
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:21,125
They were here once.

636
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:22,725
So where are the Ninth, old man?

637
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:24,861
This is your country.

638
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,313
What has happened here?

639
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:33,181
This is where
the Empire ends, Demetrius.

640
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,358
There's nothing left but this wall.

641
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:39,965
We came all this way
for a legion of ghosts.

642
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,557
Should've made our stand in Rome.

643
00:56:49,378 --> 00:56:51,108
It would have been hopeless.

644
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:52,709
He must know.

645
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:55,729
Ah, he's fought
hopeless battles before.

646
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:58,652
And you have stood by him.

647
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:07,588
Any time, anywhere.

648
00:57:18,642 --> 00:57:20,538
(birds flap as if disturbed)

649
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,811
DEMETRIUS:
They look like farmers.

650
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,732
KUSTENNIN: Who are you?

651
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:35,568
I'm Aurelianus Antonius
of the Nova Invicta.

652
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:37,070
These are my men.

653
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:38,612
I'm Kustennin.

654
00:57:38,686 --> 00:57:40,603
These are mine.

655
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:44,267
I'm looking for the Ninth Legion
of the Roman Army.

656
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,841
Why do you come so far for them?

657
00:57:48,003 --> 00:57:49,218
Rome has fallen.

658
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:52,363
What happened here?

659
00:57:53,399 --> 00:57:55,348
The Dragon Legion is no more.

660
00:57:57,156 --> 00:58:00,015
They were more than 1,000 strong.
Who could have defeated them?

661
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,384
Kustennin, where are
my countrymen?

662
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:08,808
Commander, I am
Flavius Constantinus Marcellus,

663
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:10,317
general of the Ninth Legion.

664
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:14,686
Rome abandoned us.

665
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:16,678
Some men left to fight in Gaul.

666
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:19,249
Those with families stayed here.

667
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:22,141
Now you see we live like Celts.

668
00:58:22,213 --> 00:58:24,074
We have a whole new generation.

669
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,834
AURELIUS: We saw villages destroyed,
people slaughtered.

670
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,302
KUSTENNIN: Vortgyn, King of Anglia.

671
00:58:29,377 --> 00:58:33,286
He's taken the southern kingdoms,
and now he wants to rule all Britannia.

672
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:38,299
He's left us in peace so far.
We are no threat to him.

673
00:58:38,371 --> 00:58:42,063
And he knows we are
no ordinary farmers. Come.

674
00:58:51,979 --> 00:58:57,818
We bring greetings to Lord Vortgyn,
conqueror of the Anglian people,

675
00:58:57,892 --> 00:59:01,132
rightful ruler of Britannia.

676
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:08,806
There is a boy.

677
00:59:09,905 --> 00:59:11,252
A boy?

678
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:14,944
He carries a sword.
The sword carries a prophecy--

679
00:59:15,012 --> 00:59:17,574
"One edge to defend;
one to defeat.

680
00:59:17,646 --> 00:59:20,022
In Britannia was I forged
to fit the hand of--"

681
00:59:20,087 --> 00:59:22,519
"...he who is destined to rule."

682
00:59:25,517 --> 00:59:27,466
You, uh, know of this.

683
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,456
You say a boy has it?

684
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:30,813
Where is this boy?

685
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:32,380
Here, in Britannia.

686
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:33,954
Oh!

687
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:36,325
I've waited all my life for this.

688
00:59:38,965 --> 00:59:41,463
Lord Vortgyn, the sword belongs--

689
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,963
To the hand of he
who is destined to rule!

690
00:59:48,473 --> 00:59:51,869
This...is the hand.

691
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:57,882
Then I take the boy
and the man who travels with him.

692
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:01,889
This man...

693
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:06,556
Tell me about the man.

694
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,151
He is the boy's teacher.

695
01:00:09,225 --> 01:00:10,375
Acts like a priest.

696
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:14,072
He is not Roman,
maybe from Gaul or here, in Britannia.

697
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,768
He has a scar here
in the shape of a sword.

698
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,497
Like this?

699
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:22,972
The same.

700
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:29,295
When I have the sword...

701
01:00:30,684 --> 01:00:33,082
I will make you a gift of the boy.

702
01:00:33,157 --> 01:00:34,591
And the man?

703
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,298
(sighs tremulously)

704
01:00:37,236 --> 01:00:39,611
The man is mine.

705
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:46,392
This blade was forged
from a flaming stone

706
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:49,537
that fell to Earth from the stars.

707
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:53,166
Who has ever seen such a thing
in the dark of the sky at night?

708
01:00:54,938 --> 01:00:56,372
Then you will know,
and you will know,

709
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:57,917
and you will know,
and you will know,

710
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:59,491
that what I tell you is true.

711
01:00:59,565 --> 01:01:02,225
The stone of fire that fell to Earth

712
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:07,135
cooled in the ice of a mountain
and turned to iron.

713
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:11,481
There it was found
by a master blacksmith, a Calybian.

714
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:14,909
He hammered the metal in his furnace
for three days and three nights,

715
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:17,064
hammering
in the white heat with no stop,

716
01:01:17,136 --> 01:01:19,567
no, not so much as to eat or drink.

717
01:01:21,729 --> 01:01:25,191
The cutting edge he tempered
in the blood of a lion,

718
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,571
and see here--
he carved the pentangle,

719
01:01:28,636 --> 01:01:32,228
a symbol of faith and truth,

720
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:35,989
so whoever held this sword

721
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:38,915
would have faith
and know that it would serve

722
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:42,506
one cause, and one cause only.

723
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:46,233
The truth.

724
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:49,023
AURELIUS: Would you
take up arms again?

725
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:51,313
For the emperor?

726
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:56,059
We swore a sacred oath
to defend our emperor to the death,

727
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:58,083
but to go against the Goth...

728
01:01:59,377 --> 01:02:01,074
It would take a miracle.

729
01:02:03,328 --> 01:02:05,574
(giggling)

730
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:11,959
It's so simple for them.

731
01:02:12,997 --> 01:02:15,724
They like each other,
and they're not afraid to show it.

732
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:23,596
How do you see me, Aurelius?

733
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:28,437
You're a fine warrior.

734
01:02:30,569 --> 01:02:33,296
You let your guard drop
occasionally, you're...

735
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:34,415
careless, sometimes.

736
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:41,738
Show me.

737
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:56,511
Is that all you see me as,
a warrior?

738
01:02:57,509 --> 01:02:58,856
You're a handsome woman
in your way.

739
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:02,643
(clanks)

740
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,147
Such passion, Commander.

741
01:03:04,223 --> 01:03:06,238
You must have broken many hearts.

742
01:03:12,382 --> 01:03:13,696
You're getting slow.

743
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:14,913
Must be age.

744
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,856
You know, your attacks
are a little too predictable.

745
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:31,743
So, where am I open?

746
01:03:32,523 --> 01:03:33,574
There.

747
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,671
Not bad.

748
01:03:42,738 --> 01:03:43,953
(sheathes sword)

749
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:47,129
ROMULUS:
Do you know this place?

750
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:49,097
AMBROSINUS:
Once, yes, I knew it well.

751
01:03:49,901 --> 01:03:52,464
This was a sanctuary
for those whose lives

752
01:03:52,536 --> 01:03:54,934
were dedicated
to the secret of the sword.

753
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:56,640
Did you live here, Ambrosinus?

754
01:03:58,446 --> 01:04:00,143
Here I was given this,

755
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:01,877
by Vortgyn.

756
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:06,507
Aah!

757
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:08,172
Where is it?!

758
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:11,036
He wanted the power
of the sword for himself...

759
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:12,317
(screams)

760
01:04:12,387 --> 01:04:15,564
...but the secret could only
be given to a righteous man.

761
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:18,161
That moment. so long ago.

762
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:21,662
marked the path
of both our lives forever after.

763
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:23,917
ROMULUS: The pentangle.

764
01:04:24,882 --> 01:04:26,482
It's the same as on the sword.

765
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:28,817
Remember the prophecy?

766
01:04:29,883 --> 01:04:32,030
"In Britannia was I forged...

767
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:34,893
to fit the hand of he
who was destined to rule."

768
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:38,556
I left Britannia in search
of the sword; I found you.

769
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,507
I knew then that what was written
must come to pass.

770
01:04:43,664 --> 01:04:45,678
but I'm Caesar without an empire.

771
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:47,768
How can I fulfill the prophecy?

772
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,174
Have I taught you nothing?

773
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:52,879
Prophecy is an act of faith,

774
01:04:52,948 --> 01:04:54,962
and we are the keepers of the faith.

775
01:04:58,582 --> 01:05:00,083
What do you think, Aurelius?

776
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:03,332
Would you bury your sword for this,

777
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:08,889
to have a home,
keep cattle, grow fat?

778
01:05:11,945 --> 01:05:13,480
When it's over.

779
01:05:15,095 --> 01:05:16,529
Maybe then.

780
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,215
I'm cold.

781
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,854
(swans honking)

782
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:41,655
(goats bleating)

783
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:47,209
(eerie cry)

784
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,394
(birds flying away)

785
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,407
(cry continues)

786
01:05:58,171 --> 01:05:59,517
Well, little one.

787
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:03,692
I want you to...

788
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,522
go back to your people.

789
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,927
Carry a message for me.

790
01:06:08,997 --> 01:06:12,424
You have a friend
who comes from a distant land.

791
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,473
They must give him up.

792
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:17,693
Look.

793
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:28,041
(screams)

794
01:06:32,477 --> 01:06:33,659
KUSTENNIN: Ygraine?

795
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:45,448
The blacksmith's family.

796
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:49,951
This is Vortgyn at work.

797
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:52,547
- Oh, please, don't make them kill me!
- No, no, no.

798
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:53,670
- They'll kill me.
- Shush, child.

799
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:56,371
- They won't kill you.
- Yes, they will. They'll kill us all.

800
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,554
(pants hysterically)
Unless we give them...

801
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:03,085
Him.

802
01:07:04,184 --> 01:07:06,680
(sobbing)

803
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:07,804
Romulus?

804
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:11,408
Lovely Romulus.

805
01:07:21,722 --> 01:07:26,048
The boy. He is the one.

806
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,424
He is Romulus Augustus Caesar.

807
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:37,040
Why us, Aurelius?

808
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,639
Why did you come to us?

809
01:07:55,934 --> 01:08:01,223
I lost my wife and two sons today...

810
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:03,603
and I want revenge...

811
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:10,864
but the bitter truth is
if we stand against Vortgyn,

812
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:12,851
many more will die,

813
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:15,718
perhaps all of us and our families.

814
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:18,923
That's not revenge; that's suicide.

815
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:22,208
The boy should go,

816
01:08:22,273 --> 01:08:25,133
- and those who came with him.
- VILLAGER: It's not our fight.

817
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,347
(murmuring)

818
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:28,246
VILLAGER 2: That's true, suicidal.

819
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:31,358
Let us hear Aurelius.

820
01:08:31,429 --> 01:08:33,061
I will speak for him.

821
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,110
Everything you have been told is true.

822
01:08:45,551 --> 01:08:46,931
I am Caesar.

823
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:53,894
We came asking for your loyalty,
but Rome has not been loyal to you.

824
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:57,144
Now, if it is the right path
and if it will save more lives,

825
01:08:57,213 --> 01:08:58,909
then I will surrender to Vortgyn.

826
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:06,586
Whatever is decided here
will be my destiny.

827
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:09,187
What are we doing?
This is our emperor!

828
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:13,135
One day will decide this,
one final battle.

829
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:17,928
At dawn I leave for the fort with my men
to fight and defend from there.

830
01:09:17,996 --> 01:09:21,720
Those of you who will stand with us,
we welcome you as brothers.

831
01:09:22,686 --> 01:09:25,413
Those who will not,
we leave you also as brothers.

832
01:09:26,573 --> 01:09:28,040
I salute you all.

833
01:09:29,688 --> 01:09:30,642
Hail, Caesar.

834
01:09:30,718 --> 01:09:32,634
ALL: Hail, Caesar.

835
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:42,079
You kept your armor,
after all these years.

836
01:09:42,152 --> 01:09:44,528
Ten years of farming gives you
something worth fighting for.

837
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:49,697
Twenty as a legionary...
teaches you to be ready for the day.

838
01:09:49,765 --> 01:09:51,013
Good man.

839
01:09:57,444 --> 01:09:59,075
It was made for my brother.

840
01:09:59,146 --> 01:10:00,558
Doesn't he need it?

841
01:10:01,555 --> 01:10:03,252
He's grown since then.

842
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:33,862
If we all die tomorrow, Ambrosinus...

843
01:10:34,801 --> 01:10:36,368
what happens to the prophecy?

844
01:10:37,307 --> 01:10:41,580
Now is the test of our faith,
and we are the keepers of the faith.

845
01:10:44,663 --> 01:10:46,393
We keep the flame alive.

846
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:51,535
What happens after
is not ours to know.

847
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:33,970
(chatter)

848
01:11:34,036 --> 01:11:35,667
(coughing)

849
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:43,992
(neighs)

850
01:11:51,286 --> 01:11:53,334
If we don't live to see tomorrow...

851
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:58,248
Nothing will ever part us.

852
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,268
ROMULUS: Commander.

853
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:13,603
A boy once took your sword.

854
01:12:17,723 --> 01:12:20,352
What if he now
offered you his in exchange?

855
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:23,594
I would use it well...

856
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:26,550
and salute the Caesar
to whom it belongs.

857
01:12:36,387 --> 01:12:37,635
You are Caesar...

858
01:12:38,892 --> 01:12:40,174
wherever you are.

859
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:43,549
Always remember.

860
01:13:13,746 --> 01:13:14,863
My friends.

861
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:18,556
We've all seen
many mornings like this one.

862
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,808
Together we've watched the sun rise

863
01:13:20,878 --> 01:13:23,407
and not known if that day
would be our last.

864
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:26,289
Some comrades I've seen
scarcely out of boyhood,

865
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:28,056
trembling before their first battle.

866
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,537
It was a cold morning, Commander.

867
01:13:29,602 --> 01:13:32,034
That it was, Demetrius.

868
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:34,190
And you men of the Ninth Legion,

869
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:35,674
all of us,

870
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:37,984
together we
have fought all our lives

871
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:40,132
for the empire
that our ancestors created

872
01:13:40,203 --> 01:13:43,762
and together we have watched
that empire crumble to dust.

873
01:13:46,982 --> 01:13:49,129
but with its fall
we have lost two friends...

874
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:53,335
and I can tell you
that in the darkest moments,

875
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,451
I came to believe that there
was nothing left to fight for,

876
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:59,182
but I've been shown
through the wisdom of others

877
01:13:59,253 --> 01:14:01,629
that there is
one more battle to be waged

878
01:14:01,694 --> 01:14:06,468
against tyranny
and the slaughter of innocents.

879
01:14:06,545 --> 01:14:09,786
Let us defend to the last breath
this island of Britannia

880
01:14:09,854 --> 01:14:12,383
against those who would
tear out its heart and soul.

881
01:14:12,454 --> 01:14:14,886
And then those
who come after us will remember

882
01:14:14,961 --> 01:14:18,389
that there was such a thing
as a Roman soldier

883
01:14:18,462 --> 01:14:20,806
with a Roman sword
and a Roman heart!

884
01:14:20,871 --> 01:14:21,823
Hail, Caesar!

885
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:23,431
ALL: Hail, Caesar!

886
01:14:23,504 --> 01:14:24,754
AURELIUS: Demetrius!

887
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,639
Commander!

888
01:14:30,124 --> 01:14:31,503
MAN: Secure the gates!

889
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:32,849
(horses whinny)

890
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:39,588
(army rumbles forward)

891
01:14:44,096 --> 01:14:45,048
How many?

892
01:14:45,124 --> 01:14:47,522
AURELIUS: A thousand,
maybe more.

893
01:14:47,597 --> 01:14:49,229
Not as many as I thought.

894
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:55,172
You two man the walls.
Tertius, command the archers.

895
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:02,173
MAN: They're out front!
Man battery! Light pitches!

896
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:03,658
Archers!

897
01:15:12,493 --> 01:15:13,741
Attack!

898
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:15,475
(yelling)

899
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:24,661
Aim!

900
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:26,232
Shoot!

901
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:36,290
Vortgyn, I give you...

902
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:37,412
Fire!

903
01:15:41,757 --> 01:15:43,071
Aim!

904
01:15:43,555 --> 01:15:44,639
Shoot!

905
01:15:54,935 --> 01:15:56,188
Sorcerer.

906
01:15:57,259 --> 01:15:59,536
They have the sorcerer!

907
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:00,035
Clear!

908
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:03,971
VORTGYN: That is no sorcerer.

909
01:16:04,037 --> 01:16:06,381
That is the keeper of the sword.

910
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,157
Aah!

911
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:21,607
Stay close to me.

912
01:16:26,522 --> 01:16:28,603
The gate won't hold.
Watch out!

913
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:45,243
Uhn!

914
01:17:09,535 --> 01:17:11,430
- Aaah!
- Demetrius!

915
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:17,432
Whoa!

916
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,634
Uhn!

917
01:17:27,846 --> 01:17:31,119
(roaring)

918
01:17:31,186 --> 01:17:32,884
Yah!

919
01:17:33,724 --> 01:17:36,099
bring me Caesar's sword!

920
01:17:39,731 --> 01:17:41,046
Uhn!

921
01:17:42,975 --> 01:17:44,673
Ow!

922
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,060
Uhh!

923
01:18:28,205 --> 01:18:29,386
No!

924
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,347
I thought--I thought I had...

925
01:18:38,419 --> 01:18:42,658
Too many, old friend.
We don't have a chance.

926
01:18:43,8 61 --> 01:18:46,906
(footsteps rumbling)

927
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,378
They're coming.

928
01:19:20,596 --> 01:19:22,162
The Ninth.

929
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,621
Aah!

930
01:19:35,245 --> 01:19:36,745
To the last breath.

931
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:41,532
Archers, make wall!

932
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,462
MIRA: Romulus?

933
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,034
Romulus!

934
01:21:54,593 --> 01:21:56,970
(groaning)

935
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,998
After all you've done
to my country...

936
01:22:05,066 --> 01:22:07,497
my Britannia, burn in hell!

937
01:22:07,571 --> 01:22:09,914
(screams)

938
01:22:19,425 --> 01:22:20,444
AMBROSINUS: behold!

939
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:26,839
The tyrant, Vortgyn...

940
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,124
He's dead!

941
01:22:32,402 --> 01:22:34,746
Retreat! Fall back!

942
01:22:49,588 --> 01:22:50,640
Romulus!

943
01:22:51,804 --> 01:22:53,152
Romulus!

944
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:13,190
(horse whinnies)

945
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:40,304
(slices, groans)

946
01:24:44,588 --> 01:24:45,870
That's for my mother.

947
01:24:45,938 --> 01:24:47,733
(slices, groans)

948
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:50,078
And my father.

949
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,222
Aurelius?

950
01:25:20,404 --> 01:25:22,902
Aurelius, stay.

951
01:25:32,386 --> 01:25:34,149
Stay close.

952
01:25:43,501 --> 01:25:44,880
You fought like a dragon.

953
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,444
And you fought
like the son of a dragon.

954
01:25:57,443 --> 01:25:59,490
(groans)

955
01:26:01,008 --> 01:26:02,739
You once swore to defend me.

956
01:26:02,808 --> 01:26:05,567
Mm, to the last breath.

957
01:26:06,404 --> 01:26:08,267
Have I discharged you
from that oath?

958
01:26:10,806 --> 01:26:14,114
Then live, Aurelius Antonius.

959
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:52,495
And all of you,
the last of my legions...

960
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:55,739
we won a great victory today.

961
01:26:56,999 --> 01:26:59,112
And now I say...

962
01:26:59,482 --> 01:27:01,346
no more blood.

963
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:05,543
No more war!

964
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:08,075
(sword whooshes)

965
01:27:14,538 --> 01:27:17,680
(wind whistling)

966
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:41,066
And that was how the last of the Romans
found a home, here in Britannia,

967
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:46,010
and how, after years of turmoil,
they brought peace to the land.

968
01:27:47,046 --> 01:27:49,903
What happened
to the commander, Aurelius?

969
01:27:49,969 --> 01:27:51,766
Oh, he lived.

970
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,746
He took the warrior maiden Mira
for his wife.

971
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:55,319
And Romulus, the boy?

972
01:27:55,393 --> 01:27:57,311
They raised him as their own son.

973
01:27:57,335 --> 01:27:59,335
He grew to be a wise ruler.

974
01:28:00,535 --> 01:28:02,535
He took a Celtic name,

975
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:05,035
"son of a dragon."

976
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:06,035
Pendragon.

977
01:28:06,435 --> 01:28:08,935
Pendragon.
That's my father.

978
01:28:09,135 --> 01:28:11,535
And you remember
the little girl, Ygraine?

979
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:12,555
He married her.

980
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:14,235
My mother?

981
01:28:14,835 --> 01:28:18,135
And Ambrosinus
took back his real name.

982
01:28:19,435 --> 01:28:21,235
Merlin.

983
01:28:21,335 --> 01:28:22,800
You?

984
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:24,399
Merlin--it's just a story.

985
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,635
You made it up. It's a legend.

986
01:28:26,835 --> 01:28:28,951
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur.

987
01:28:29,026 --> 01:28:30,835
Have I ever lied to you?

988
01:28:31,235 --> 01:28:32,635
Every day.

989
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,892
Hmm.

990
01:28:41,558 --> 01:28:42,609
That's it.

991
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:44,335
That's where the lost legion
made their stand.

992
01:28:51,235 --> 01:28:53,635
Great legends were made here.

993
01:28:54,735 --> 01:28:56,235
With you as the hero.

994
01:28:56,835 --> 01:28:58,235
Of course.

995
01:29:12,935 --> 01:29:14,835
We need heroes, don't we?

996
01:29:55,535 --> 01:30:00,635
(cawing)

997
