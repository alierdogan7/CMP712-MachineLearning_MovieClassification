This is the Article 32

You're facing
a general court-martial...

346

and charged with violation
ofat least three articles--

everything from "breach of peace"
to "conduct unbecoming."

348

But the bottom line-- 83 counts,
violation ofArticle 1 1 8, murder.

No, wait a minute.

He'll be prosecuting

advisor and secretary ofstate...

396
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,613
is that we've got a trial
in two weeks.

-Seems awfully damned fast.
-Everyone in this room will agree...

398
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,787
it's in the national interest that
this trial be moved along quickly.

399
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,660
The Article 32 investigation
was complete and comprehensive.

400
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,459

in one direction.

Has he got a lawyeryet?

402
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,902
He's requested a military
attorney, Colonel Hayes Hodges.

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,700

404
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,467
Any relation to
General H. Lawrence Hodges?

most distinguished offilcers.

What do we know about
Colonel Hayes Hodges?

408
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:29,148
He's a guy who got
blown apart in Vietnam,

409
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:31,912
then went to Georgetown Law
and became a cynic.

He was 67th in his class
at Georgetown, sir.

doesn't win too many.

divorce, had a drinking problem,

00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:04,750
Nobody reports seeing any
weapons among the demonstrators.

499
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:07,981
- His psych eval was a disaster.
- What about embassy footage?

500
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:10,489
Cameras, fil lm, videotape,
home movies, shit like that?

501
00:45:10,557 --> 00:45:15,654
No, I've subpoenaed everything.
The embassy got hit pretty good.

502
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:19,096
- Most of it was destroyed.

[Man Grunting]

504
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,870
Terry, you know Tom Chandler. He's
gonna help us prepare your case.

505
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:29,602
Colonel Childers, good to see
you again, sir. Um, all right.

506
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:33,578
First, we've subpoenaed all
the Article 32 investigator's notes,

507
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,581
the State Department's
notes on Yemen.

508
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:39,141
Major Biggs has already had
your head checked by their doctor.

509
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:41,016
I've got you an appointment
with ours.

510
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:43,113
- No.
- What?

511
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,159
No more multiple choice
questions about self-esteem.

512
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:48,922
We got the combat filtness reports.
He can forget the psych eval here.

513
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,691
That's a mistake, Colonel.

514
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:54,495
Listen, when I turned 1 8
I joined the Marine Corps.

515
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:56,536
I asked to be in the infantry.

516
00:45:56,603 --> 00:45:59,003
- I asked to go to Vietnam.
- Terry.

517
00:45:59,072 --> 00:46:01,336
I live for the privilege
ofcommanding troops.

518
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:03,899
I think it's the greatest honor
an American can have.

519
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:06,605
You know how many birthdays
and Christmases I missed,

520
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,614
spent rotting in jungles
or in the desert,

521
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,616
just so you could play
war at ROTC?

522
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:15,121
Childers! You gotta keep
your shit together here, man.

523
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:17,622
Your court-martial board
is gonna be made up of people...

524
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,125
who might've spent one day in
Grenada, maybe two days in Kuwait.

525
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:22,627
They're gonna be beach boys who've
never been anywhere near combat.

526
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,323
They're gonna be people
like Tom Chandler...

527
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:26,127
sitting right here in front ofyou.

528
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:29,225
That's who you're
making your case to.

529
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:33,239
We don't have anybody
to back up your case.

530
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:36,333
That's because
all my witnesses are dead.

531
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:41,445
- Okay. So what happened?
- He lost it. He snapped.

532
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:43,346
That's good.
We can snap him on the stand.

533
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:45,009
This doesn't happen in a vacuum.

534
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:47,519
Let's get a complete history
of Colonel Childers.

535
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:50,181
Talk to every marine
he ever served with.

536
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:52,157
My guess is
this has happened before.

537
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,420
We have to be careful here.

538
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:56,724
This guy is
the warrior's warrior.

539
00:46:56,797 --> 00:47:02,360
A Navy Cross, two Silver Stars
for composure in battle.

540
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:05,462
He has no wife, no kids,
just the Corps.

541
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,873
He was our best.
That's why he was sent.

542
00:47:09,943 --> 00:47:12,138
He's not on trial for the
good service he gave the country,

543
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:14,680
but for what he did
on the wallin Yemen, period:

544
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,648
Major, nobody wants to say it,

545
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:19,709
but it occurs to me we're trying
to set an example here.

546
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,653
So let's set it and show
the world we mean business.

547
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:27,126
The fil rst charge supports the death
penalty, and I say we go for it.

548
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:28,991
No more death.

549
00:47:29,062 --> 00:47:31,758
I'll see that he never gets another
command and I'll put him in jail,

550
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:35,461
but I will not seek death for a man
who served his country honorably.

551
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,799
Idon't want it
brought up again:

552
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:41,068
We gotta show
Childers' state of mind.

553
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:43,166
We gotta prove he went out
with intent to kill,

554
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:45,473
and that is not going to be easy.

555
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:48,173
Whether a man is charged
with murder or hailed as a hero...

556
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:50,910
is sometimes a very thin line.

557
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:55,114
Our case is this: Childers receives
orders that a regularly scheduled,

558
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:58,851
Iawful protest outside
our embassy in Yemen is unruly.

559
00:47:58,925 --> 00:48:01,792
He is to secure
or evacuate the premises.

560
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:04,626
There has been no violence
prior to his arrival.

561
00:48:04,698 --> 00:48:06,131
Once there, Ambassador Mourain...

562
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:08,861
does not feel the situation
warrants evacuation.

563
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:11,301
- Childers ignores him.
- There wassniperfire:

564
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:14,397
They draw fil re from snipers
across the street.

565
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:18,001
Childers retaliates into an unarmed
crowd in front ofthe embassy.

566
00:48:18,078 --> 00:48:22,037
A crowd ofwomen and children.
He shot the wrong people.

Allright, here's what this means:

568
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,678

up to the deathpenalty:

00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:30,313

the guy next to you.

played, you'll beat the house.

knockin' some zit-faced kid around.

592
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:04,009
You have to understand the kind of
pressure Childers has been under.

A man with that kind ofservice--
No, no thanks.

594

This was a rescue mission
that went bad. Nothing more.

595
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:12,691
You're aware, Colonel,
we could ask for the death penalty.

596
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,192
You're not serious.

597
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,855
Oh, I'm very serious.
In fact, it's been suggested.

598
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,331
What do you think would happen
ifa Yemeni killed 83 Americans?

599
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,197
He'd have a trial
that would last for one day,

600
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,531
and they'd take off his head.

601

So here it is:
You plead him out. Guilty.

He throws himselfat the mercy.

605
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:41,218
- We'll help him out at sentencing.
- How much help?

606
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,813

anything, but I'd say...

was for a second lieutenant...

in Vietnam in 1 968?

611
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:57,002
I don't have time
for 20 questions, sir.

612

the odds ofwinning at blackjack?

You got time.
Take a guess.

00:51:04,711 --> 00:51:08,010
My guess is your man's going down
'cause he deserves to go down.

615
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:14,420
I got a question foryou, Colonel.
What happened at Ca Lu?

616
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:17,923
The battle ofCa Lu,
Vietnam.

617
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,290
You were there with Childers.
Something happened. What was it?

Fuckyou is what happened
at Ca Lu, Biggs.

00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,133
Two weeks.

620
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:29,634
Life expectancy of
a second lieutenant...

621
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:32,194
in combat in Vietnam
was two weeks.

622
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:33,705

to prepare this case.

623
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:35,968
I need your permission
to go to Yemen--

00:51:36,042 --> 00:51:39,637
It's all here, Hodge. We did an
exhaustive Article 32 investigation.

00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:42,273

3,000 miles away. I need more time.

Colonel Childers used...

1023
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,217
when he ordered you to fil re
on the demonstrators?

1024

I don't remember
the exact words, sir.

1025
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:48,791
He orderedme
to open fire:

1026
01:25:50,561 --> 01:25:52,529
When you obeyed Colonel
Childers' order to open fil re,

1027
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:54,531
did you believe it
to be a lawful order?

1028

Yes, sir.

Otherwise it would have been your
duty to disobey. Is that right?

Yes, sir.

When your men opened fil re
on the attackers in the crowd,

1032

did the snipers in the buildings
across the way cease their fil ring?

1033

Absolutely, sir.
It went completely quiet.

1034
01:26:08,346 --> 01:26:09,472

What was the last thing
you saw him do?

1042

- He went to the flagpole.
- Then what'dhe do?

1043
01:26:24,796 --> 01:26:26,855

Was he personally
under heavy fil re at that time?

1045

- Yes, sir.
- No more questions.

where was the point of greatest
concern for the safety ofyour men,

01:26:39,544 --> 01:26:43,913

01:27:01,866 --> 01:27:04,767
Did you feel an immediate mortal
danger from the crowd as a whole?

1056
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:06,804
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

1057
01:27:06,871 --> 01:27:09,931
- No, sir.
- Let me help you.

1058
01:27:13,177 --> 01:27:14,769
Were you more worried...

1059
01:27:14,846 --> 01:27:17,314
you'd be killed by these people
or by these people?

1060
01:27:17,382 --> 01:27:19,976
I wasn't thinking about that.
Have you ever been under fil re?

1061
01:27:20,051 --> 01:27:23,817
You didn't see the crowd fil ring, but
you did take fil re from the snipers.

then that's what I said!

- Are these "the motherfuckers"?
- Objection.

- Major.
- Yes!

1349
01:43:12,169 --> 01:43:15,935
The crowd in front ofthe embassy
had no weapons, did they, Colonel?

1350
01:43:16,006 --> 01:43:17,633
Objection. We found
no snipers' weapons either.

1351
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:19,767
Yes, they had weapons!

1352
01:43:19,843 --> 01:43:21,777

and nobody gets hurt?

Yes, innocent people probably died.

Innocent people always die.

my orders!

There are rules, and marines
are sworn to uphold them.

1359

I was not going to stand by
and see another marine die...

- I didn't remember.
- "Waste the motherfuckers."

That's brilliant.
You didn't think that was important?

Why didn't you know
about the goddamn recording?

- I had a week to prepare this case.

Your Honor, the government
calls Colonel Bin Le Cao...

1387
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:18,152
- as a rebuttal witness.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1388

What are the grounds for
this rebuttal witness to be allowed?

Will counsel please
approach the bench.

1390
01:45:28,872 --> 01:45:32,171
- Who is Colonel Bin Le Cao?
- A North Vietnamese Colonel...

1391
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,301
who fought against Colonel Childers
at the battle of Ca Lu.

1392
01:45:34,377 --> 01:45:37,574
What he has to say directly refutes
statements made by Colonel Childers.

1393
01:45:37,647 --> 01:45:40,081
- When was the battle of Ca Lu?
- 1 968.

1394
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:43,847
This is uncharged misconduct. It is
not allowable under military law.

1395
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,320
How do you know this witness
is going to charge misconduct?

1396
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:47,356
I'm assuming--

1397
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:49,324
He knows because he was
at the battle of Ca Lu.

1398
01:45:49,392 --> 01:45:51,326
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

1399
01:45:51,394 --> 01:45:54,261
On what grounds are you
calling your witness?

1400
01:45:54,331 --> 01:45:56,526
Colonel Hodges made Colonel
Childers' combat experience...

1401
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,033
part of his defense.

1402
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:00,035
Furthermore,
Colonel Childers testifiled...

1403
01:46:00,103 --> 01:46:02,037
that he never shoots unarmed people.

1446
01:48:24,381 --> 01:48:29,080
it would persuade Colonel Childers

[Biggs] Colonel Terry Childers
is a decorated warhero,

1456
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:14,425
a trusted leader
ofAmerican marines,

1457
01:49:14,497 --> 01:49:17,864
and I wish that was
all there was to it.

1458
01:49:17,934 --> 01:49:21,267
Unfortunately, there are
83 dead Yemeni citizens,

1459
01:49:21,337 --> 01:49:24,500
many ofthem
women and children.

1460
01:49:24,574 --> 01:49:28,567
Colonel Hodges would have you
believe that this crowd was armed.

1461
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,977
He would also have you believe
that there is a videotape...

1462
01:49:31,047 --> 01:49:33,379
proving this to be true.

1463
01:49:36,419 --> 01:49:40,287
There is no tape
exonerating Colonel Childers.

1464
01:49:40,356 --> 01:49:44,053
There is no evidence
exonerating Colonel Childers!

1465
01:49:51,367 --> 01:49:55,963
Is Colonel Childers a man capable of
killing defenseless, unarmed people?

1466
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,302
Is he capable ofordering
the execution...

1467
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:03,743
of innocent
men and women?

1468
01:50:03,813 --> 01:50:08,910
Is he capable ofexecuting
P.O.W.s with his own hand?

1469
01:50:08,985 --> 01:50:11,818
Unfortunately,
we have shown that he is.

1470
01:50:11,888 --> 01:50:14,379
You have heard the sad testimony
of Colonel Cao...

1471
01:50:14,457 --> 01:50:17,722
who witnessed Colonel Childers'
barbarism fil rsthand.

1472
01:50:19,829 --> 01:50:22,730
You've even heard
Colonel Childers' own admission...

1473
01:50:22,799 --> 01:50:27,168
that his desire was to "waste"
them, regardless ofwho they were.

1474
01:50:30,807 --> 01:50:34,903
Now, we are faced
with the diffilcult prospect...

1475
01:50:34,978 --> 01:50:37,344
ofconvicting
one ofour own.

1476
01:50:37,413 --> 01:50:40,382
None of us wants to do this,
but you've heard the facts,

1477
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:42,680
and it is unavoidable.

1478
01:50:42,752 --> 01:50:46,688
Colonel Terry Childers ordered
the senseless slaughter...

1479
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:49,623
ofa peaceful crowd!

1480
01:50:49,692 --> 01:50:53,788
Now, asmarines,

1481
01:50:53,863 --> 01:50:57,890
we do notget the luxury
ofcovering up ourmistakes:

1482
01:50:57,967 --> 01:51:00,731
We must air them,

1483
01:51:00,804 --> 01:51:04,365
thereby ensuring
that they never happen again.

1484
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,204
Thankyou.

1485
01:51:14,384 --> 01:51:16,318
That's sovereign
United States territory...

1486
01:51:16,386 --> 01:51:19,321
as much as if it were
in Ohio or Maryland.

1487
01:51:19,389 --> 01:51:21,880
Colonel Childers didn't
volunteer to go over there.

1488
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:24,984
He was ordered to go there because
he was the best man for thejob.

1489
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:27,052
We armed him.
We trained him.

1490
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:29,724
We sent him over there to risk
his life to save other Americans.

1491
01:51:29,799 --> 01:51:33,235
And then ask him
not to return fil re?

1492
01:51:33,303 --> 01:51:37,000
There are over 300 bullet holes
in this building.

1493
01:51:37,073 --> 01:51:41,772
Colonel Childers didn't open fil re.
He returned fil re.

1494
01:51:41,845 --> 01:51:45,781
And he waited until after three
of his marines were dead...

1495
01:51:45,849 --> 01:51:48,113
and another lay
mortally wounded.

1496
01:51:48,184 --> 01:51:50,709
He waited until he was
personally under heavy fil re.

1497
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:54,814
He waited until he saw
that crowd holding weapons.

1498
01:51:54,891 --> 01:51:58,452
Only then did he order
his men to return fil re.

1499
01:51:58,528 --> 01:52:00,393
Under the rules ofengagement,
a civilian pointing a weapon...

1500
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:02,363
is no longer a civilian,

1501
01:52:02,432 --> 01:52:05,060
and the use ofdeadly force
is authorized...

1502
01:52:05,134 --> 01:52:08,626

to see that crowd.

But the camera on the embassy

would have you believe...

there's no tape
from that camera.

delivered to the State Department.

By not producing that tape,
the national security advisor,

into this court.

is innocent.
