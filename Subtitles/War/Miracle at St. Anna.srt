<i>It's them bells!</i>

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,007
<i>I've had them in my</i>

<i>[man 2] Hey, sergeant.</i>
<i>Where's Major Lance?</i>

6
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,559
<i>[man 3] We moved the CP back to</i>

8

<i>[man] Colonel! Am I glad to see you!</i>

11

<i>[man 2] Those bodies...</i>
<i>Get those bodies down!</i>

12
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,212
- <i>What are you doing? Get 'em down!</i>
- <i>Of course. Yes, sir.</i>

13
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,415

<i>Don't want those boys left up there.</i>

<i>We're gonna hold this town till</i>

00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,385
- Hey, buddy.
- Um, press.

35
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,011
OK.

36
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,786
- Are you Detective Ricci?
- That's my story.

37
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,059
I heard about you.

38
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,966
[grunts] Yeah, well,
you oughta change friends then.

39
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,903
I'm Tim Boyle. <i>Daily News.</i>

40
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,873
- What happened?
- Read about it in the <i>New York Post.</i>

41
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,809
They left here two hours ago along with
<i>The Times, Newsday</i> and every channel

42
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,804
you can get on TV with a wire hanger.
Ain't you ever heard of the early bird?

43
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,716
- Christ.
- Go find a wailing wall.

44
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,686
- I got lost.
- Comin' here?

45
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,779
Find another way
for a dollar to change pockets.

46
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,223
- It's my first day as a reporter.
- It's probably your last.

47
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,921
Welcome to New York.
Be like Governor Rockefeller:

48
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,658
- Come and go at the same time.
- Give me some angle.

49
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,758
All I can give you
is an empty feeling, kid.

50
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,929
The perp's over at Bellevue,
eighth floor peanut gallery.

51
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,405
The victim's deader
than yesterday's beer.

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,034
Heard he wasn't special
when he was breathing.

53
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,534
My next job's gonna be stuffin'
ballot boxes on Staten Island.

54
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,175
Remind me to vote. I live there.
Most cops do. Go home, kid.

55
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,082
- Don't stop for bread.
- Come on.

56
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,555
Gotta be something I can work.
Can I give you a tip on a hot horse?

57
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,353
I'll play Santa at the PA
on Christmas Day. Or I'll...

58
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,385
I'll pay Hong Kong Sue over on Forty
Deuce to blow your noodle like Satchmo.

59
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,557
How about I put a story
in your hip pocket?

60
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,691
"Good Cop Helps Poor Kids."

61
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,465
Honest to Jesus, you get three months
of Saturdays out of it. Come on.

62
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,972
I can't go back to scratching out obits.

63
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,034
See those guys?
Don't turn around.

64
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:49,174
They're rolling up to Harlem
to sniff around the perp's apartment.

65
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:53,151
Only case that dynamic duo has cracked
has Schaefer written on the side,

66
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,849
but maybe you'll see something.
Don't quote those gumflappers.

67
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,720
- You need a quote, you call me.
- OK.

68
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,249
- Haggerty, Dillard!
- Yeah, what's up?

69
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:05,321
- Take this guy uptown with you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,890
- Come on.
- All right.

71
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,238
We'll start in the living room
and work our way back.

72
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,510
Close the door behind you, kid.

73
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,440
This perp is very, very religious.

74
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,913
Nothing wrong with being
in good standing with the Lord.

75
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,377
And a war hero, too.
Look at this, a Purple Heart.

76
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,482
Hey, Keith, the Brown Bomber.

77
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,359
[Keith] Muhammad Ali would've knocked
him out. Way too fast for Joe Louis.

78
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,295
He can run, but he can't hide.

79
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,203
Hey, Dan, what the hell is this?

80
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,805
- [Dan] What you got there?
- I don't know. It's heavy.

81
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,807
Whatever this is, it ain't junior-grade.
This thing looks expensive.

82
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:38,620
My wife claws around flea markets
looking for this crap every weekend.

83
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,523
I'm telling you, this ain't normal.

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,255
This definitely ain't normal.

85
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,162
- Back up, buddy.
- Sorry.

86
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,722
[Keith] No problem.

87
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,564
- Professor Brooks?
- Yes.

88
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:56,572
I get a lot of these things.
Old rocks. Antique specials.

89
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,510
It seems like every
schmuck in the world

90
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,572
who finds a backyard arrowhead
mistakes me for Iris.

91
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,049
Put it here.

92
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,748
From Greek mythology.
She is the faithful voice of Zeus.

93
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,453
She flies from place to place
and commands respect

94
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,895
from mortals and from im...

95
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,426
...immortals.

96
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,964
- Where the hell'd you get this?
- From a perp's apartment.

97
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,270
- It's got this mark...
- Don't touch it.

98
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:35,008
This is over 450 years old.

99
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,847
It's the missing Primavera
from the Santa Trinita.

100
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,353
Is that the <i>Niña,</i> the <i>Pinta</i>
or the <i>Santa Maria?</i>

101
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,446
Oh, for God sakes, detective.

102
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,481
It's the oldest elliptic

103
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,893
arch bridge in the world.

104
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,456
It's in Florence, Italy.

105
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,763
Built by Ammanati.

106
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,202
This was one of four statues on it.

107
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:04,073
The Primavera, meaning "spring."

108
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,941
This head has been missing

109
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:10,608
since the Nazis blew up
the bridge in 1944.

110
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,883
My God! This is a gold mine!

111
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,680
A gold mine!

112
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,820
Yo!

113
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,501
[elevator dings]

114
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,482
Merry Christmas. From Tim Boyle.

115
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,613
Oh, wise guy.

116
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,612
[Tim] Mr. Hector Negron?

117
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,991
[children shouting]

118
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,454
[in Italian]
Darling, come back to bed.

119
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,980
Please. Enough.

120
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,687
I need a little break, OK, baby?

121
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,100
[Tim] They say you haven't
spoken or eaten in two days.

122
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,162
They'll try to force-feed you.

123
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,503
Make you rise, like Jesus.

124
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,950
Come on. I've hiked all over
New York asking about you.

125
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,782
I talked to everybody.
Cops, your sister.

126
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,381
Spoke to your cousin in San Juan.
You're clean as a board of health.

127
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,086
You got no kids, no debts, no enemies.

128
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,253
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

129
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,661
Twenty-five years
of a great marriage,

130
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,963
till your wife's heart gave out.

131
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,562
So why you stick a German Luger
in a guy's chest

132
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,940
three months short of your retirement?
Five million dollars.

133
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,946
That's how much that head would
draw on the black market.

134
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,677
What's it doin' buried there
on the bottom of your closet?

135
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,925
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

136
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,453
Unless you can afford a lawyer,
you're gonna swallow happy pills

137
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,296
in this nuthouse the rest of your life.

138
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:20,101
But my story could help you.
And you need help, mac.

139
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,106
[woman, in Italian] Enrico, what kind
of art dealer specializes in Nazi art?

140
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,981
Because it's a lucrative business.

141
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,189
[in Italian] You Americans love work
more than you love 'love.'

142
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,383
[groans]

143
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,794
[in Italian] My love,
are you ignoring me?

144
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,394
[Keith] Pina, no.
Don't come over here.

145
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,102
[in Italian] Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.

146
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,005
I gotta catch up. World might've
ended, I wouldn't know

147
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,237
'cause we've been going at it
two days. For crying out loud.

148
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,245
[in Italian] The world is still here.

149
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,610
You and I are still here.

150
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,342
Baby, not right now.

151
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,975
There you go. Excuse me.

152
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,621
OK?

153
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,654
Oh, God. Oh, that feels good.

154
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,493
[Pina giggling]

155
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,165
You're killing me, baby.

156
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,361
[in Italian] Yes, I love you to death.

157
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,031
[sighs]

158
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,454
I...

159
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,883
Hmm? What is it, Mr. Negron?

160
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,130
I... I know.

161
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,892
You know what?

162
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,400
I know who the sleeping man is!

163
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,846
- [Tim] You know what?
- I know who the sleeping man is.

164
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,476
[bells tolling]

165
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,918
[child yelling in Italian]

166
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,940
[man whimpering]
Mama. I want mama.

167
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,710
Kill me now! Kill me now,
I wanna go home to my mama!

168

I don't wanna be here.
I wanna go home!

169
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,378
Kill me now! Kill me now!

170
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,547
Oh, Jesus, I want my mama!
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

171
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,680
Shh!

172
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,386
- Hector, shut him the fuck up.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,418
- I don't wanna die!
- Shut the fuck up!

174
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,230
[whispering] You wanna get us all
killed? That's your mama right now.

175
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,361
- This far enough?
- Keep movin'.

176
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:50,637
- You doin' fine, big fella.
- Help me, Lord. Help me, Lord.

177
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,474
Help me, Lord,
I'm prepared for Thee.

178
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,879
- Get off of me, sniper bait!
- Bishop, Train, switch flanks.

179
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,247
Bishop, take outer.
Train, take the inner.

180
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,081
- What's that?
- Take inner flank.

181
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
- What's that?
- Come on. Switch places, dummy.

182
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,212
Gimme some room.

183
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,324
Hey, Bishop.
Why we got to cross this river?

184
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,628
They sellin' hoecakes
and beer on the other side.

185
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,758
[laughs]

186
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,262
- My good luck charm gives me strength.
- Piece of shit you found

187
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,468
in the gutter in Florence?

188
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,502
Couldn't draw a bowl of turtle soup
from Uncle Amos with that.

189
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,911
Worth more than a bowl of soup!

190
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,847
Shh!

191
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,851
Train.

192
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,753
Hector, you speak Italian.
Cut-off head worth somethin'?

193
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,724
- <i>Yo</i> speaky Puerto Rican, man.
- Hey, muzzle that.

194
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,225
Keep moving.

195
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,163

198
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,707

<i>Waiting.</i>

202
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:20,591
<i>Your white commanders</i>
<i>won't tell you that, of course.</i>

203
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,620
<i>Why? Because they</i>

[whimpering]

205
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:30,292
<i>But the German people have</i>

206
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,271
That's why I'm warning you now,
with all my heart and soul.

207
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,968
Save yourself, Negro brothers.

208
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,308
<i>Why die for a nation</i>
<i>that doesn't want you?</i>

209
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,645
<i>A nation that treats you like a slave.</i>

210
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,150
<i>Did I say slave?</i>

211
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,983
Yes, I did.

212
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,286

Why don't they shut her up?

213

What is she saying?

214
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,219
Berlin can afford to pipe
that garbage all the way here

215
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,321
but can't give us potato soup.

216
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,427
Individual guns only, on my command.

217
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,629
We have enough ammo
for an hour, maybe two.

- <i>Of course not!</i>
- [man] Steady, ya'll. Adolf Hitler.

Don't believe a word of that!

227

<i>They're not thinking of your children!</i>

<i>They're home right now.</i>

234
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:09,060
Asleep, in a nice warm bed.

Better to drop your guns,

No.

- Or anything else?
- Not for you.

You a replacement?

65th Army Corps.

No.

What's your name, soldier?

- Yeah.

<i>To stand tall?</i>

[whispering] Oh, no.

413

Where's Train?

He ain't...
He ain't make it.

415
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,643
That nigger's dumber than a dime.
You sent him over the hill?

416
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,480
- I ain't tell him to risk his life.
- It's nobody's fault.

417
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,543
That boy was born over the hill.

418
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,018
[Bishop] Follow me.

00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,274

We wait here till dark,
and then we cross back.

00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,201
Good.

This shit is heavy as hell.

Bishop!

430
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,680
- Where you going?
- Y'all go on back across that river.

431
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,686
The only person with any luck
around here is him.

432
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,985
Plus, he owe me $1,400.
That's the kind of money

433
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,355
that can set me up
for the rest of my life.

434
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,384
Even if the rest of my life is today.

435
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,835
[grunts, in Spanish]
To hell with this.

436
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,678
I'm up shit's creek.

437
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,186
- Jesse Owens!
- [Train] Jack Johnson.

438
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,216
You go talk to your wife up there.

439
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:27,149
I never felt so lonesome
in my whole life, Bishop.

440
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:31,018
- I been dreaming a lot.
- Yeah.

441
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:35,958
Nigga, I ain't really interested in your
dreams. I want my motherfucking money.

442
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,224
I got something's
worth more than $1,400.

443
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,795
Better than black cat's bones.
Make you invisible.

444
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,665
Gives the strength of five people!

445
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,399
I think your cheese
done slid off your biscuit.

446
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,738
You never see me chalk the line
for no white kid like you done.

447
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,573
- You told me to!
- I didn't tell you to get us killed.

448
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,746
This uniform don't change nothing for
us. This is a white man's war, Train.

449
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:05,517
Negroes ain't got nothing to do with
this. This boy ain't got no life nohow.

450
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,650
Why he don't? Hmm?

451
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,753
A life of goodness is not what these
white folk has chosen for they children.

452
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,026
Look at me.

453
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:20,964
Good book says it, Proverbs 22:16.

454
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:26,033
"Raise up a child the way you want him
to go, and he will not depart from it."

455
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,044
Now, he's trained to hate.

456
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,279
Shit, his life ain't worth
a dollar of Chinese money.

457
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,013
Listen here, Bishop.

458
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,250
This boy ain't done nothing to you.

459
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,087
Mm-hm.

460
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,821
You didn't want him before, did you?

461
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,527
- Where you goin', Sam Train?
- Hey, Stamps, we movin' or not?

462
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,404
We hold here till night.
Me and Bishop'll take first watch.

463
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,278
Hector, you and Train take second.
Give the boy whatever first aid you got.

464
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,553
What'd you get us into now, Diesel?

465
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:22,259
It's always something with you,
big fella. Here, you gonna need these.

466
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,733
Come on, kid.
[speaks Italian] Eat.

467
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,167
Eat.

468
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,162
Come on.

469
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,003
He won't take the medicine.

470
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,807
Go on, give it here.

471
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,216
You want some chocolate, boy?

472
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,257
I wouldn't get attached.
He'll be dead in a week.

473
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:53,252
I ain't never been this close
to a white person before, Hec.

474
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,528
Never even touched one.
Not even a dead one.

475
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,934
If this one dies, I'll give you
a whistle as a consolation prize.

476
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,962
- You really think he'll die?
- Why worry about it?

477
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,998
We could all be dead
in an hour anyway.

478
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,974
Why you always kissing that thing, Hec?

479
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:18,853
- Reminds me who my father is.
- I don't need help remembering my pa.

480
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,518
His name's Chester.
Chester Train.

481
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,390
Let's give this kid some water.

482
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,790
[in Italian] Water.

483
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:34,995
Arturo?

484
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,271
Can I ask you something?

485
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,707
What you want, boy?

486
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,643
[in Italian] Can you tell me who I am?

487
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,781
Hector, you speak that Italian?
What's he saying?

488
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,284
He said, "Who am I?"
But who's he talking to?

489
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,343
Lord, I knew it!

490
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,083
I could see it in his face!
Look at him, Hec.

491
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,920
Shh! Quiet down.

492
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,426
Good God!

493
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,361
- He got the power!
- What power?

494
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,423
God knows it. In the olden days,
everything could speak.

495
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,867
- The trees, the birds.
- Shh!

496
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:10,101
If you could hear them things,
then that mean you had it.

497
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:18,308
This boy's standing
in the shadow of God, Hector.

498
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:22,478
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you for standing
on Your holy righteous word, Lord!

499
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,283
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!

500
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,967
As you were.

501
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:18,000
- General Almond.
- Colonel.

502
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,874
I have a photo you should see, sir.

503
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,007
Forget that a minute. How bad
are the numbers from yesterday?

504
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,642
- Bad, sir.
- And Ike gets mad when he gives me

505
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,517
waiters and shoeshine boys
to fight the Krauts with.

506
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,580
Germans are dug in.
And that gun at La Spezia's killing us.

507
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:38,084
Fifteen thousand colored soldiers.
One in four is a casualty.

508
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,222
And all I'm hearing about
is one goddamned gun?

509
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:45,167
We have guns, too, here.
Look, see, colonel? I got one.

510
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:49,832
This colored division...
This is an experiment, Jack.

511
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:54,936
An experiment. These are the first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers. Not ours.

512
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:59,847
- Sir, I respectfully disagree.
- That's why they sent you here, Jack.

513
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,647
To lead me into the New World.

514
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,120
A gift from the Brits.
Taken at 11,000 feet. See?

515
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,650
That's a German buildup at
Lama Di Sotto. Two or three regiments.

516
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,630
- Surprise attack you worried about?
- I hope not.

517
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,462
I got corroboration from a partisan.

518
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,991
Anybody crush grapes
with feet can't be trusted.

519
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,936
Get some Krauts to confirm.

520
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,735
Already working on it, sir.
Captain Rudden!

521
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,672
- Good evening, general.
- Come.

522
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,411
Germans may be planning counter-
offensive down the Serchio Valley.

523
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,443
We need a POW to confirm.
You running patrols there?

524
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,320
George Company has a squad
sitting right in that area.

525
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,621
- How?
- They pushed across the Serchio

526
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,356
beyond Hill Maine at the weak point.
I heard them call for artillery.

527
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:50,594
Might've broken Jerry's hold
on the river. Captain Nokes didn't fire.

528
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,398
- Why not?
- He couldn't see 'em, sir.

529
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,871
Didn't believe they crossed,
they got hung up.

530
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:59,342
I had Fox Company positioned
down the river from George Company.

531
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,345
Got pretty hot over there.
Four of 'em right up a mountain.

532
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,609
Got weapons and a radio
if they're alive.

533
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,378
- Who are the four men?
- Shouldn't be hard to find out.

534
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,885
One of them's the biggest Negro
you've ever seen in your life.

535
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,945
Mmm.

536
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,083
Very well then. Dismissed.

537
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,500
[door shuts]

538
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,289
[speaking German]
My God, I've had it.

539
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,850
Come on, it's enough.

540
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,019
Yeah, let's go.

541
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,298
I need something to eat.

542
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:34,695
[speaking Italian]
The Germans are leaving!

543
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,637
[bell tolling]

544
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:48,111
[speaking German] Push it up
or I'll kill it right now.

545
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,982
I'm pushing as hard
as I can.

546
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,749
Pull, pull, pull.

547
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,689
My goodness I'm hungry.

548
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,991
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.

549
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,231
[in Italian] Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.

550
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,634
They won't get fat on it.

551
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,229
Let's hope they choke on it.

552
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,832
Shut up, the two of you!

553
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,140
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.

554
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,320
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,

555
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,118
tell us if we'll see him
or never see him again.

556
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,647
Is he still alive?

557
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,660
My eyes aren't
what they used to be.

558
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,992
- [rattling table]
- Come on!

559
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,327
So, so, so?

560
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,697
We can't even joke? Come on.

561
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,127
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.

562
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,196
You're the usual scoundrel!

563
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,640
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,

564
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,699
he thinks he can do what he wants.

565
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,210
Oh yes?

566
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,612
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?

567
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,740
The Pope?

568
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,842
Maybe, because it wasn't us.

569
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,182
And the light?

570
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,777
How did your electricity come back on?

571
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,981
Papa.

572
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,182
Come with me.

573
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
Come with me.

574
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,783
How did the light come back on?

575
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,660
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.

576
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,300
You would think that
after all these years,

577
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,969
you would treat your friends better.

578
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,377
What is wrong with you, Papa?

579
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,505
Would you tell me?

580
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,681
It's Natalina.

581
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,153
What did she do?

582
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,054
She put the evil eye on me, that Witch.

583
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,423
You still going on about the same story?

584
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,691
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.

585
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,098
There's strange things going on.

586
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,602
My electricity returned...

587
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,536
from God knows where
after two and a half years.

588
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,233
I was going to ask you about that.

589
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,970
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...

590
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,741
for every bandit and German to see.

591
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:01,444
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.

592
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:02,884
What are you talking about?

593
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,451
She prays for you every day.

594
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,853
Know what I say?

595
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:16,158
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.

596
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,531
Tell everyone that
Mussolini disgusts you,

597
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,298
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.

598
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,502
Il Duce made us a world power again.

599
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,375
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.

600
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,971
Papa, II Duce betrayed Italy.

601
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,778
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.

602
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,115
You are still so young, my child.

603
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,053
You don't know the ways of the world.

604
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,579
But you will learn.

605
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,717
And from whom?

606
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,090
From a Fascist like you?

607
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,222
You're just like your mother.

608
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,993
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts

609
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,932
are only good for hiding dirt.

610
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,127
Okay, let's go.

611
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,868
[knocking on door]

612
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,674
Germans!!!

613
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,471
It's your house.

614
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,483
Holy Mother of God.

615
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,564
It's okay.

616
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,569
It's okay.

617
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:27,695
It's okay, it's okay.

618
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,602
Hector, ask who's in charge.
Tell them we're Americans.

619
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,204
[in Italian] Americans?

620
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,274
[in English] Me, too. Half.

621
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,580
[in Italian] Half.

622
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,213
[in English] Me sister Ida, half.

623
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,019
[in Italian] We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.

624
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,322
Put us together,
we make one American.

625
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,793
[in Italian] Okay, wait. Wait.

626
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,695
Wait. Wait. Wait.

627
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,959
Thank you.

628
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,261
Who's in charge here?

629
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,613
Anybody here speak English?

630
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,412
[in Italian]
Where are the Germans?

631
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,683
Everywhere. Boom, boom.

632
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,452
My name is Renata.

633
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,263
- Where'd you learn English?
- I was nanny for a British family.

634
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,860
And a jolly good tuck-in-the-bed
tinkerer you must be.

635
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:36,838
- You can nanny me. Want a Camel?
- Cool it, Bishop.

636
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:41,037
I'm Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps.
We got a boy that needs help.

637
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,806
[in Italian]
A boy? He has a boy.

638
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,505
Oh, my God.

639
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,577
Is he alive? Put him here.

640
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,211
Slow. Slowly.

641
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,052
Where did you find him?

642
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,286
[Hector] On the Mountain.
Do you know him?

643
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,386
[Natalina]
No, I don't know him.

644
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,897
But he can stay here
until he gets better.

645
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,128
Tell them we're taking the boy
to a hospital. They can come.

646
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,399
They need to evacuate.
We'll escort them down the mountain.

647
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:11,202
[in Italian] We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.

648
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,134
The hospital around the corner?

649
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,372
The Germans are everywhere.

650
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,438
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.

651
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,949
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.

652
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,782
I don't know how you
got past Vergemoli.

653
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,483
The only way to Pietrasanta...

654
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,185
where the Americans might be...

655
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,749
is over that way,

656
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,786
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

657
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,259
Says we're surrounded.

658
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,460
Doesn't know how we got
past German lines,

659
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,732
but the only way we might find
some Americans is up there.

660
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:44,137
- The Mountain of the Sleeping Man.
- Sleeping Man?

661
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,575
- [in Italian] What is that?
- It's a legend.

662
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:53,571
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.

663
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,312
So he lays across the Mountain...

664
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,753
to protect her from the wind and rain.

665
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:02,986
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.

666
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:07,395
Legend has it that
one day he will awaken.

667
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,726
A legend about a shepherd
that fell in love...

668
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,067
Whatever she's saying,
we gotta rest until sunup.

669
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,369
- OK.
- Stay here? No, no.

670
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,136
Stay here. <i>Si, si.</i>

671
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,167
If they sing to the Krauts,
we will pull a trigger on this

672
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,046
and tell the hammer to hurry. Won't be
nothing but powder and steel here.

673
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,643
We are not Germans.
We are Italians.

674
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,052
- Full blood.
- And what are we? Half blood?

675
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,955
[in Italian]
We should take him...

676
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,722
and put him to bed.

677
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,993
The boy stays here. He's sick.

678
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,549
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

679
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,809
[in German]
Catching up on your reading?

680
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,977
Yes, Colonel, I'm informing myself
about the enemy.

681
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:40,353
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.

682
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,358
This helps us identify them.

683
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,587
Who is the poet?

684
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,356
Giovanni Pascoli.

685
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:51,857
Do you think it's appropriate
to waste your time reading poetry?

686
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:57,771
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.

687
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,105
What are you planning to do about it?

688
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,204
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.

689
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,714
My men are exhausted.

690
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,943
We need ammo and food.

691
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,612
Food? You want food?

692
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,349
You can suck icicles
in Russia...

693
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:18,725
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.

694
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,322
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?

695
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,528
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.

696
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,502
Good. Listen closely.

697
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,407
I have come too far to repeat myself.

698
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,709
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.

699
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:42,480
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.

700
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,147
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.

701
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,453
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...

702
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,153
to him and his criminal friends.

703
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,252
Bandenbefehl?

704
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,923
Is there an echo out here?

705
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:59,094
General Kesselring's standing
field order for the Italian Republic.

706
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,626
At a commander's sole discretion,

707
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,469
for every one German soldier killed,

708
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,873
we execute ten Italian civilians.

709
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:12,439
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.

710
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:16,111
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...

711
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,677
my men would kill innocent civilians.

712
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,350
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

713
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:27,159
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.

714
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,131
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.

715
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,532
Bandenbefehl!

716
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,729
Bandenbefehl.

717
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,439
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.

718
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:43,969
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.

719
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,311
And three:

720
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:50,217
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.

721
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,026
We are missing a Corporal...

722
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,691
from the 35th Regiment,
2nd Battalion, 5th Company.

723
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,725
Name: Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.

724
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,738
[Eichholz] We have some every day.
What's so special about him?

725
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,141
You and I are not here...

726
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:17,010
to question the Führer's orders.

727
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,606
You are to send out a search party.

728
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,139
Find him.

729
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,879
Don't let him escape.

730
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,910
And when you have him...

731
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,822
get word to me immediately.

732
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,696
Let's go!

733
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,275
<i>[in Italian] If I am no longer</i>
<i>that lamp...</i>

734
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,115
<i>which flickers in front</i>
<i>of a sweet Maria.</i>

735
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,620
[in German] What does that mean?

736
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,653
God help this poor bastard Brandt.

737
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,924
Whatever he's done,

738
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,827
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.

739
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:08,928
Mount a search party.

740
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,956
We have to find him first,

741
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,992
hold him and give him a few days...

742
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,131
before Pflueger pulls out
his teeth, one by one.

743
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,197
Yes.

744
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,007
I'll be relieved when this war is over.

745
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,909
I want to return to my family.

746
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,136
[in Italian]
I've watched you grow up.

747
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,441
But you haven't become much.

748
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,946
And he can't do much.

749
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,845
- You're laughing at me?
- Of course.

750
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,350
Where did you get that?

751
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,875
So many things you want to know.

752
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,012
Here. Take it and eat.

753
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,385
Give me some, too.

754
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,686
Are you afraid you're
not going to get any?

755
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,885
Here. Grow.

756
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,553
Give me a chestnut, too.

757
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,026
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.

758
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,725
Hey, leave me alone.

759
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:18,700
Aren't you the dandy?

760
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,498
Ah, he's offended.

761
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,503
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?

762
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,239
You have to be on the lookout.

763
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,510
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.

764
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,176
I almost choked.

765
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,846
You wait here.

766
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,331
My friend.

767
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,634
The Americans are getting closer.

768
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,898
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.

769
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,069
They know it already, for sure.

770
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,171
You? How are you?

771
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,444
Me? I'm okay.

772
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,541
You?

773
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,075
I always have Marco's
face in front of my eyes.

774
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,651
Don't worry about that.

775
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:20,924
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.

776
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,089
I care.

777
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,530
In your opinion...

778
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,832
when we will be in front of God,

779
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,701
if we ever get there,

780
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,707
is he going to ask us
for our political card?

781
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,710
Is he going to say,
"Marco, no... Ludovico, no.

782
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:38,236
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists."

783
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,877
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?

784
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,183
You're asking yourself
too many questions.

785
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,816
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.

786
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,452
And then who will kill the Germans?

787
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,518
Hey.

788
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,164
Anyway, what's done is done.

789
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:09,307
George Company to 370,
George Company to 3-7, over.

790
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,243
George Company to 370, over.

791
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,738
[in Italian] Someone tell that
big beast to get out of my room.

792
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,838
Shh! The Boy has a fever.

793
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,510
He needs to eat and get some rest.

794
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,542
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.

795
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,760
Arturo.

796
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,300
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...

797
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,165
if you could only see it.

798
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,694
It's enormous.

799
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,900
No, even bigger.

800
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,302
Of course I saw it.

801
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,471
It's all made of chocolate.

802
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,481
You break a piece off,

803
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,312
and it grows back.

804
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,716
Yes, I did save a piece for you.

805
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,685
Good heavens.

806
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,220
Something's not right.

807
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,664
Someone put the evil eye on him.

808
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,998
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.

809
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,869
- To where?
- With the Americans.

810
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:44,566
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.

811
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,234
This is my house.

812
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,640
I have a house too.

813
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,010
Natalina.

814
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,536
What do you think?

815
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,640
I say this Boy is talking to the Devil.

816
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,208
We need a Priest here.

817
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,413
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.

818
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,321
A Priest can take
the Devil out of him.

819
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,383
Train, get up. We gotta book.

820
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:10,092
[Train] Excuse me.

821
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:13,568
Hey, boy. Hey.

822
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:17,663
Time for you
to take your medicine again.

823
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,032
Here it comes. Ready?

824
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,738
[humming]

825
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,270
There. Thank you.

826
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,009
Get you some of that soup, boy.

827
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,179
Mmm.

828
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,624
- Yes.
- He would not eat before.

829
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,323
Here you go, boy.

830
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,136
It's all over your shirt.

831
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,434
- Come on, boy. Let's go.
- [in Italian] My Chocolate Giant.

832
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,345
- OK, sarge. We ready.
- Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

833
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:01,282
We? Boy, where the hell "we" goin'?

834
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,410
You wasn't chiseling him,
we wouldn't be here.

835
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,080
- You think Nokes is lookin' for us?
- What?

836
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,420
Hector been tryin' to fix that radio
since we got here.

837
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,222
- Shh!
- What?

838
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,657
<i>Arrive- damn-derci.</i>

839
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:28,375
Hector. We gotta bail. Ask the old man
if he'll show us another way outta here.

840
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,812
- Maybe we can reach the 366.
- We can't get five feet outta here

841
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,645
without being flavor of the week
for the <i>Guten Tags.</i>

842
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,642
These people survived for years
without mortars. Stay with the <i>paisans.</i>

843
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,986
You wanna stay here and play house,
go ahead, but I'm bookin'.

844
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:45,619
Ask the old man if he'll show us
another way outta these mountains.

845
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:50,291
Tell him we'll pay him. We got plenty of
that funny money they use around here.

846
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,493
[speaks Italian]
Can you show us a safe path?

847
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,400
There is no safe way.

848
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,064
Germans. Boom! Boom!
