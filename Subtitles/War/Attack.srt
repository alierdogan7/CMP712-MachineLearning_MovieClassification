00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:30,246
Fragile Fox, Fragile Fox. First squad.

4
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:33,580
First squad. Over to you, Lieutenant.

5
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:40,962
How about it, Ingersoll?
Gonna try for that pillbox?

6
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,637
We can give it a try, but we'll
need support if we get jammed.

7
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,263
They still got you pinned?

8
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:50,768
- Yes.
- Then we go ahead all the way.

9
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:56,233
But if we get pinned down, we'll need
Captain Cooney to get us outta there.

10
00:00:56,779 --> 00:01:01,571
- Fragile Fox, over and out.
- Heroes. Glory hounds.

11
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:07,781
Got that, Captain? First squad from
my platoon, they're going all the way.

12
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,559
Are your men set to support 'em?

13
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,837
Give me a hand signal. Out.

14
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,652
Höher.

15
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:57,702
Lousy mortar.
They got Ingersoll's squad zeroed in.

16
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:02,550
They're pinned by machine-gun fire.
Now they're getting it with mortars.

17
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:05,714
Attack from your side,
take the heat off of Ingersoll.

18
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:11,508
Fragile Fox One, this is Two.
Let's get the lead out!

19
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:14,183
Over and out.

20
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,021
Cooney, where are you?
You said you'd back them up!

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,782
It's up to you, Cooney. Do you hear me?

22
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,319
Cooney, where are you?!

23
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,491
Fall back!

24
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,469
Cooney! Cooney!

25
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:49,758
I can't hold.
The machine gun's still got us pinned.

26
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,102
You said you'd back them up!
Come in, Cooney.

27
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,933
Cooney! Cooney! Cooney, over!

28
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:08,149
It's all over, Lieutenant.

29
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:12,279

All right, all right, knock it off.
Come on.

00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,378
Knock it off!

38
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:40,300
We've been waitin' around here for
two hours and you expect instant coffee.

39
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,510
Jackson, you ain't an orderly orderly.

40
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:45,681
And that jug is out of uniform.
It ain't wearing any rust.

41
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:51,067
- Fill it up. That oughta make it rusty.
- Very funny. Who's it for?

42
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,986
- Captain Cooney.
- Captain Cooney?

43
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:56,233
Every time Jackson runs an errand,
Cooney tips him a stripe.

44
00:05:56,366 --> 00:06:00,779
- Hurry. He's expecting Colonel Bartlett.
- There's a parlay for ya.

45
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:04,411
When you salute them two,
you gotta apologise to your arm.

46
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,791
- What's with Cooney and the colonel?
- What's the hot dope?

47
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
- You got the inside pipe to Cooney.
- Spit it.

48
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:15,713
We get Christmas in Paris, or do I
climb the walls to get to my pin-ups?

49
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,879
- The captain never tells me anything.
- Baloney.

50
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,800
Jackson, you're a traitor.

51
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:25,099
Besides, I don't trust soldiers
who shine their shoes.

52
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:28,098
Jackson! Jackson!

53
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:33,023
- His master's voice.
- Mother's calling.

54
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:35,192
- Coffee, Private?
- Why not?

55
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,563
I already got an ulcer.

56
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,283
Strong, ain't it?

57
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,748
- You called me, Captain?
- Yes, I called. Where are the forms?

58
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,006
- Which forms, sir?
- Which...?

59
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:01,718
The replacement forms.
They should be at Division today.

60
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:05,466
- Already sent them out, sir.
- Oh. OK.

61
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,808
Did you get the coffee?

62
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,022
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,188
Well, come on, come on!

64
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:20,482
The way they run this army...
Inefficiency, repetition.

65
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:26,369
Huh! I tell you, son, if I ran my business
back home the way they run this army,

66
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,738
I'd be bankrupt in a month.

67
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,791
- One month!
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,963
It'd be a break for the taxpayers
if they'd let some...

69
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,209
let some businessmen
take over for a change.

70
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,916
It's an interesting idea, Captain.

71
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,800
Get that box of cigars
out of my musette.

72
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:52,853
I want Clyde... Colonel Bartlett...
to feel like he was back home.

73
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:58,068
Like we was both back home.
Little ol' Riverview.

74
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:02,655
- Some cigars and a few ashtrays, too?
- Yeah, but nothing fancy.

75
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:07,528
We're just a couple of small-town
boys, the colonel and me. Understand?

76
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,702
We like our pleasures...

77
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,666
simple.

78
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:19,749
- Get a towel, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,506
- John?
- Yes, sir?

80
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,804
Did you get those requisitions
approved for the winter underwear?

81
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:35,688
Wouldn't you know it, sir?
Only the top parts.

82
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,270
Great. Just great.

83
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,520
Hi, there, Woody boy.
You all set for the game?

84
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,895
- All ready.
- The colonel will be along...

85
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,070
Where is Costa?

86
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,992
- Joe? Hasn't he shown up?
- No!

87
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,363
He's been getting a little out of line
lately. He's unofficer-like.

88
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,908
I'm sure you're mistaken, Captain.

89
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:02,209
John, you told the lieutenant
he was expected, didn't you?

90
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,385
Yes, sir. I told him this morning.

91
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,757

- Carry on, gentlemen. Corporal.
- Hey! Hi.

94
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,192
Erskine, Woodruff. Is this all?
You in a mind to play three-handed?

95
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:33,074
Costa's been held up.
I'm gonna put a torch under him now.

96
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,411
You do that, son.

97
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,747
And tell him I said
to bring plenty of money.

98
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,622
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,669
Well, Clyde! Glad you could get over!

100
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,802
Sure... Where's that bourbon
you were talkin' about?

101
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,052
Comin' right up.

102
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:04,518
You, uh, care for a little branch water?

103
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:07,322
You don't want me
to rust my plumbing, do you?

104
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:22,073
Ø Pittsburgh, mon père faisait ça.

105
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,748
Oh? Il était forgeron?

106
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:31,086
- Costa, where are you?
- I'm in here, Harry!

107
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,971
Yeah. Fabriquer...

108
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:43,353
Harry, how do you say "railroad tracks"?

109
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:45,807
- Des rails de chemin de fer.
- All right.

110
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,686
Des rails de chemin de fer.

111
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,278
Oh.

112
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:51,314
Harry, meet Monsieur Bouisse.

113
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,524
Monsieur Bouisse, Lieutenant Woodruff.

114
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,900
Enchanté. Enchanté.

115
00:10:56,036 --> 00:11:00,745
- This is his shop. It's nice, huh?
- Yeah. Look, you know what time it is?

116
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:05,335
Know how old this shop is? 500 years.

117
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:09,756
- It's been in his family all that time.
- I know, George Washington slept here.

118
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:12,339
Look, Joe, the colonel's here.

119
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,719
If we don't talk to him now,
we might not get another chance.

120
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,887
So he's here.

121
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,639
- All right, Jackson, take off.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,308
Don't worry about
little ol' Erskine Cooney.

123
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,478
- Sit down.
- Yeah.

124
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:36,564
- Well? Did you bring the letter?
- The letter?

125
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,274
- From my father.
- No, I'm sorry, I forgot.

126
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:43,990
- I left it up at headquarters.
- Oh... Well, that's all right.

127
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,122
Just that... he hasn't written to me
very much lately, and...

128
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:51,374
The judge's been busy,
what with elections coming.

129
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,215
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

130
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:57,422
But I reckon he'd be proud
if he could see me now.

131
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,675
Sure. You're a company commander
in the US Infantry.

132
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,264
Well told, I am. And, uh...

133
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:08,647
- when my citation comes through...
- Oh, yes. The, uh, citation.

134
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:13,686
That'll make up for those times
I let him down. You know what I mean?

135
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,861
Oh, excuse me.

136
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,487
You know, I was thinking, Clyde.

137
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:22,867
Maybe I'll keep it a secret.

138
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,911
Then when I come home,
I'll walk right up to him,

139
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:30,458
I'll put my hand out for a shake,
and when he looks down...

140
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,372
- Huh?
- That's one way of doin' it.

141
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,215
That old man'll just about bust!

142
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:39,676
Yes, he will. And I aim
to get that citation for you.

143
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,797
But you're gonna have to be patient.

144
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:44,849
- Sure thing, Clyde.
- These things take time.

145
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:48,677
The right moment comes along,
and I'll slip it through.

146
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,139
- You wanna know something?
- What?

147
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,897
We get back home...

148
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:59,156
I'm gonna go right on
calling you "Colonel". Huh?

149
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,566
Huh? What do you think?

150
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:09,073
I think I'd like that fine.

151
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:15,248
I'm hard put to recall a bona fide
colonel in our corner of the state.

152
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:20,840
Joe, I've got a plan for getting
Cooney out of the company.

153
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,963
A lost cause.

154
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:26,015
- Are you gonna listen to me?
- What's to listen?

155
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:31,385
You know Bartlett has political ambitions.
Cooney's old man owns the machine.

156
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:34,606
QED, Erskine can do no wrong.
We got him for the duration.

157
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:40,154
Now you've got that off your chest, listen
to me for a second and shut up, will ya?

158
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:43,151
- Huh?
- Go ahead.

159
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:46,735
All right, now. I'll give it
to you plain and simple.

160
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,639
One is,

161
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,904
at least a part of Bartlet's political
future depends on his war record, right?

162
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:58,207
Two: Bartlett is no fool, right? Huh?

163
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,748
- Yeah, right.
- OK.

164
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:05,546
Three is, Cooney is completely
unreliable and Bartlett knows it.

165
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,382
His next foul-up could be a big one.
Not 14 men, but something big.

166
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,677
Let's face it, this is for keeps.

167
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:15,476
- So what is the plan?
- OK...

168
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:20,937
I'd like to lay it on the line with Bartlett,
suggest that he kick Cooney upstairs.

169
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,443
- Not a chance.
- Why not?

170
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:27,109
He gets the guy stashed away
in a desk job at Battalion or Division.

171
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:30,281
Worst he can do is get
his thumb caught in a filing cabinet.

172
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:35,242
Our worries are over, Bartlet's worries
are over. All we gotta do is fight the war.

173
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:38,129
Come on, Joe, what do you say?
How about it, huh?

174
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,543
It won't work.

175
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:41,836
Why not?

176
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:46,260
It won't work! And he won't go for
this straight-talk routine.

177
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:50,515
He's a lieutenant colonel,
and you're just a lousy lieutenant.

178
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,215
He'll hit you with
that old, sweet song about

179
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:57,813
"Son, I was in the National Guard
while you was learning your ABCs."

180
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:00,099
They're two of a kind.

181
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:05,027
Huh! I bet Cooney never figured on a war
when he joined that National Guard.

182
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:10,032
Probably figured it was gonna be
all corn pone and chitlins and...

183
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:16,864
and the chance to wear his uniform
to the Saturday fox hunt.

184
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,160
OK, I'll go it alone.

185
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:26,384
Don't go dramatic on me, dogface.

186
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:34,384
I'll play cards,
if you think it'll do any good.

187
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,970
OK. I tell ya, it's the only way
we're gonna get close to Bartlett.

188
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:41,557
Just remember,
one crack out of Cooney...

189
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,731
Just one.

190
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,522
- COONEY: Five in a row!
- When are leaves gonna start, Colonel?

191
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,777
Soon as we get back
to France and settle down.

192
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,615
You suppose this war might be over
before we re-form?

193
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,451
I hate to disappoint you,
but I wager it will be.

194
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,627
Sure hate to go in any rough stuff
with those green kids they've sent us.

195
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,793
Yeah, those replacements need work.

196
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:07,587
Don't worry. We'll all go home
with a record we can be proud of.

197
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:12,012
Anybody says Fox Company
isn't tops can answer to me.

198
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,765
I swear, this CO of yours is about
as touchy as a she-bear with cubs.

199
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,933
Yeah, sure is.

200
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,691
What's it gonna be here,
five-card no-draw?

201
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,518
Suits me. OK with the rest of you boys?
Still a 50-franc limit?

202
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,983
Yeah.

203
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,364
Wheel 'em and deal 'em, Lieutenant.
Wheel and deal.

204
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,781
"She-bear with cubs".

205
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,572
What kind of a crack is that?
What do you mean by that?

206
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,042
- BARTLETT: Come on, Erskine.
- Ante up, Joe.

207
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:53,136
This is a friendly game, Costa. I aim to
keep it that way. You're trying to bait me.

208
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,421
Sit down. He didn't mean a thing.

209
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,047
- You think so?
- It was a joke.

210
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,260
Tell him it was a joke, Costa.

211
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,597
I made a joke.

212
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:11,945
I guess you'll be mixing in some politics
back in Riverview, Colonel.

213
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,201
Oh, I don't know. I might run
for dogcatcher or something.

214
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,577
"Tippecanoe and Bartlett too."
I'm under the gun?

215
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,573
- COSTA: Yeah.
- Cost you gentlemen 50 francs.

216
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,035
I'll just have to bump you, Colonel.

217
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,005
Oh. Well, I'll take a peek.

218
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,587
Expose yourself, Lieutenant.

219
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,051
- Threes and jacks.
- That's a good hand.

220
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:40,636
But not good enough. Three lovely ladies,
and I'll just rake the pot.

221
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,844
- You ever lose?
- I can't afford to.

222
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:47,557
- I'm just a boy from little ol' Riverview.
- I won't forget that last session.

223
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,731
Where was that?

224
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:57,199
Oh... that was in that cellar
outside Aachen.

225
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:02,579
You cleaned us all out that game, too.
I kept bucking you.

226
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,829
BARTLETT: Oh, yeah. You and that...

227
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:09,501
Lathrop was his name, Colonel.
Lieutenant Ned Lathrop.

228
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,547
That's right. Lathrop.
He was a good man.

229
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:17,845
Too bad about him. What was he doing?
Trying to help the squad that got cut off?

230
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,509
Sergeant Ingersoll's squad
from my platoon.

231
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,929
- Well, he...
- He what?

232
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:31,684
Ingersoll disobeyed orders, trying to take
that pillbox. He overstepped his authority.

233
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:36,361
They were good men.
The best, if you ask me.

234
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,565
Well, I didn't ask you, Lieutenant.

235
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,283
Now, gentlemen,
let's keep this a friendly game.

236
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,740
Same game.

237
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:48,997
- Anyone could've seen it was hopeless.
- I don't think it was hopeless, Captain.

238
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,294
You can think anything you want.
There's no law against it.

239
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,289
But I'm ordering you to keep
your lousy insinuations to yourself!

240
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,339
- Erskine!
- He has no right to question my honour!

241
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:04,515
- Ingersoll was one of my best men.
- Sit down, Erskine.

242
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:07,642
If you're so friendly with your men,
resign your commission.

243
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,637
You don't want to be an officer.
You're just a snotnosed pup!

244
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:12,805
Cooney!

245
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,563
Come on, come on! Come on, Joe.

246
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:25,618
It's all right, Harry. I'm going.

247
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,575
If you'll excuse me, Colonel.

248
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:42,421
I'm sorry I blew it, Clyde.

249
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:47,098
Why don't you go outside and walk
around? Maybe that'll cool you off.

250
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:48,803
Yes...

251
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:52,513
I guess I will.

252
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:07,278
I'm mighty sorry
this had to happen, Clyde.

253
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,095
I'll give this to Joe when I see him.

254
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,642
Everybody goes off the deep end
sometime or another, don't they?

255
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:36,231
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:39,477
All the same, I don't think
we should spread this around.

257
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:42,446
- Spread what around?
- That's the idea.

258
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,903
Boys seem a little touchy these days.

259
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:50,953
Yes, sir, they are.

260
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,571
While we're on the subject, Colonel...

261
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,950
There's something that I'd like to say.

262
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,460
Shoot.

263
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,214
Well...

264
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,423
The morale of this company is in what
I consider to be a dangerous condition.

265
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:11,053
Oh? And what do you suppose
brought this about, Lieutenant?

266
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,219
I think it stemmed from
what happened at Aachen.

267
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,728
Oh?

268
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,772
Colonel, I know you
and Captain Cooney are very close.

269
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:21,472
Maybe I'm sticking my neck out on this,

270
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,984
but the feeling among the men is that
the captain... that he chickened out there.

271
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,653
That your opinion, too?

272
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,821
He had the only reserve.
He might've done something.

273
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:36,999
On the other hand he may have felt
his reserve wasn't strong enough.

274
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,498
Then the facts are hardly conclusive.

275
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:42,498
It's not a matter
of conclusive facts, sir!

276
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:47,630
Colonel, can I talk to you straight?
Rank and all that aside?

277
00:21:47,761 --> 00:21:49,801
I don't see why not.

278
00:21:57,271 --> 00:22:02,098
Don't suppose whatever it is you want
to go beyond the two of us. Shoot.

279
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:05,603
Colonel, you know
Captain Cooney better than...

280
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:11,443
...better than any man in this division,
maybe better than any man alive.

281
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:16,780
I know Erskine. Ever since I was
14 years old, a clerk in the judge's office.

282
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,488
You know his good points
and his shortcomings.

283
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:23,326
- Go on.
- You know he fouled up there at Aachen.

284
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:27,412
He cost the lives of a whole squad.
A good sergeant, a good lieutenant.

285
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,678
Think what he could do
if this company got in a real bind.

286
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:37,047
Come on, son, give me the punch line.
You want me to kick Erskine upstairs?

287
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:40,600
- Yes, sir, as a matter of fact...
- It figures.

288
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,605
And it's not a bad solution. But there's
some points you're not considering.

289
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:49,353
You talked straight to me
and I'm gonna talk straight to you.

290
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:54,945
I'd appreciate your discretion. This is
in confidence between you and me.

291
00:22:55,077 --> 00:23:00,035
Erskine's very important to me. Let's
make no pretence. We both know why.

292
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,033
My staff is small, compact, efficient.
Runs like clockwork.

293
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,084
Between you and me, I got no room
for Erskine over at Battalion.

294
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:11,631
- I thought of Division.
- I send him up to General Parsons?

295
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:14,429
In what capacity? I mean, specifically.

296
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:17,974
So you see how it is.
We all got our troubles.

297
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:21,718
I appreciate your concern
for the morale of this company.

298
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,478
I'm just as concerned. More.

299
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:28,101
- I'm responsible for this company.
- Why don't you face the facts?!

300
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:31,520
- A lot of guys are gonna get killed...
- Shut up!

301
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:35,522
You spoke your piece, now I'm gonna
speak mine. You listening?

302
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:37,283
Yes, sir.

303
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,744
It all boils down to one basic fact.

304
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:42,699
This company is...

305
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:47,957
Let's just say it's a bit shaky in the morale
department and not too fit for combat.

306
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:49,463
- Correct?
- Correct.

307
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,712
- That's your worry?
- That's my worry.

308
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:54,332
Then you can forget about it.

309
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:58,052
- What's your first name?
- Harry.

310
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:01,930
Stop worrying, Harry.
Cos I got it straight from the top.

311
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,354
It's a hundred to one that
we'll never see combat again.

312
00:24:07,857 --> 00:24:10,775
Is that the real word, Colonel?
From the top?

313
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:13,773
From the top. A hundred to one.

314
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,981
(RADIO BUZZES)

315
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,742
- Fragile Fox One.
- This is Division. Colonel Bartlett there?

316
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:25,912
Yes. Hold on just a minute.

317
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,368
Colonel Bartlett.

318
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:34,205
General Parsons wants to see all
commanders as soon as possible.

319
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,793
- Tell the general I'll be right over.
- Thank you, sir.

320
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:40,799
So, that being the situation...

321
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:46,466
I want you to relax
about Erskine. Ride it out.

322
00:24:46,604 --> 00:24:51,562
A year from now, you'll be a civilian again,
adjusting to the problems of peace.

323
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,898
I feel better already, Colonel.

324
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:57,685
That's the ticket, Harry.

325
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:15,171
Can you see me with a shave,
haircut, some toilet water?

326
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,961
You talk like you're the last guy left.
And we don't know if we're going back.

327
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:22,503
- Colonel's driver told me.
- What does he know?

328
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,588
- All right, there's the lieutenant. Ask him.
- OK, I will.

329
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:31,103
Hey, Lieutenant, about that scuttlebutt.
Is it for real?

330
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:34,231
- What scuttlebutt?
- About us being out of it.

331
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,478
- Don't bet on it.
- I hope they're right for once.

332
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:40,696
Let's face it, I'm a hero.
I got the blood lust.

333
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:43,065
I'm a glory hound, and when I get...

334
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,526
But you just don't like to fight.

335
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:48,235
That's my problem, Chaplain. I'm yellow.

336
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:53,615
PFC Bernstein, plump fat coward. Can
I get a section eight for being yellow?

337
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:59,127
Most of the guys'd all go to hell in a
bucket for you or Lieutenant Woodruff.

338
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,090
The way things are, this outfit's
got an esprit de garbage pail.

339
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:06,008
- Your French stinks.
- So does the morale.

340
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,050
Beat it.

341
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,056
Yes, sir.

342
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,894
Lieutenant Costa, sir.

343
00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:20,776
- Russians!
- He's a regular Cossack. He's real tough.

344
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:25,863
But underneath it all, Snowden,
there beats a heart of solid rock.

345
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,069
Stop the scratching, Bernstein.

346
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:31,821
I'm just checking to see
if I got my dog tags.

347
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,914
Hello, Lieutenant.

348
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:38,917
- I thought I'd find you here.
- So, what happened?

349
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:40,921
You jerk. Why did you blow up?

350
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,050
Forget that. I saw the colonel leave.
What happened?

351
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:47,878
I talked to him. I told him that
we were in no shape for combat.

352
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,588
- MAN: All right, let's go!
- And?

353
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:54,426
- What's going on over there?
- Never mind. What did he say?

354
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:58,014
He already knew about Cooney,
and he was understanding.

355
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,688
Sure. Understanding.

356
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,524
You'd think those two
were a vaudeville team.

357
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,989
Erskine and Clyde:
Funny sayings, eccentric dances.

358
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:09,738
Just a couple
of little ol' country boys.

359
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,827
Up to their knees in blood.

360
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:16,206
What it adds up to is this:
We've nothing to worry about

361
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,289
as far as Cooney is concerned.

362
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:23,585
The word from upstairs is
it looks like we're out of the shooting.

363
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:29,962
- What if we're not?
- He said it's a hundred to one that we are.

364
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:34,095
What if we have to go back up? The
colonel conned you out of any action.

365
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,931
He didn't con me.
He talked straight sense.

366
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:39,221
You haven't got it figured. I have.

367
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:44,351
If we go back, I got a solution for Cooney.
A simple one. No channels to go through.

368
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:48,983
- Just a nice, simple solution.
- What? Joe! What would you do?

369
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:53,363
I got it figured.
Just let him goof once more.

370
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:58,581
- Look, don't get any funny ideas.
- I mean it, Harry!

371
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,829
Lieutenant!

372
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:07,130
Get your men on the road
in 20 minutes, sir. Full packs.

373
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,842
- Back to France?
- No, sir. We're going back up.

374
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:13,759
There's been a big breakthrough.

375
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:17,474
The paratroopers are already
on their way up.

376
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:21,019
All right. Better get over
and alert the platoon.

377
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:26,059
I want all platoon leaders outside the TP
once their men are on the road.

378
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:27,939
Yes, sir.

379
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,566
Well?

380
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:38,199
A hundred to one, huh?

381
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,282
Joe! Joe!

382
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:45,037
Cooney is still in command,
for better or worse.

383
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:48,256
And that's the situation.
And I'm the exec.

384
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:52,132
If anything happens to him...
I don't care if it's you or anyone else.

385
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,634
The office makes the man, huh, Harry?

386
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:58,096
Let's wait and see developments.

387
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:32,338
The section we're concerned with is...

388
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:35,304
Now, here we are. And the...

389
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,172
- May I have your attention?
- Sorry.

390
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,843
Here we are. You got it?
We want this town, La Nelle.

391
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:47,225
You won't need this map till you get there
cos you can see it from the hill.

392
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:49,564
- What does G-2 say?
- Nothing.

393
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:54,818
It hasn't been taken yet.
I don't care how you do it. Just do it.

394
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:56,609
Right. Will do.

395
00:29:56,742 --> 00:30:00,692
Keep contact with me on the 201.
Maybe the Krauts have pulled out.

396
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:04,448
If they have, walk in.
If they haven't, run them out.

397
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:09,044
- Can we expect any assistance?
- All the other companies are committed.

398
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:12,421
This operation on La Nelle
is strictly Fox Company.

399
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,008
- OK, sir.
- Good luck.

400
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:26,269
Well, Woodruff, looks like Fox Company's
got another tough job.

401
00:30:26,397 --> 00:30:29,184
Hitting the town
from both sides would do it.

402
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:32,187
We can use Weapons
in reserve for the 1st and 2nd.

403
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,566
- I'll take Weapons, you take 1st and 2nd?
- That's sound enough. Jackson!

404
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:40,993
Get Lieutenant Costa over here.
Tell him to bring his platoon sergeant.

405
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,527
- Come on, on the double!
- Yes, sir.

406
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:46,747
If the first platoon gets pinned,
we can cover them.

407
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Let's take a closer look here.
Now, supposing...

408
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:59,337
supposing we send a platoon
to probe down the road here.

409
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,089
Nobody there, they walk in.
We follow 'em.

410
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:06,309
If they meet with any resistance...

411
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:11,062
Here. They take this old house,
here in the outskirts, and they hole up.

412
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,402
- I don't know about that.
- Your idea is sound. It's very sound.

413
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:17,770
But it's rigid. It's by the book.

414
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:21,025
This way we hold off
till we see what's what,

415
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,198
then we can hit 'em from either side.

416
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:27,160
And we got a base of fire
right here in the town, if we need it.

417
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,698
Yes, sir, that's the plan.

418
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,621
That would be one method, I suppose.

419
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,380
Hey, Costa.

420
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,215
We've got another
nasty little job to do here.

421
00:31:43,306 --> 00:31:45,345
La Nelle?

422
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:50,634
Yeah. Division wants it occupied.
We got the assignment.

423
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:54,306
There may be Krauts in there.
Most likely not.

424
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,976
Let's just go on the basis
that there are.

425
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:02,239
Here. You take your platoon
right down this road here.

426
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:04,904
You'll be covered most of the way.

427
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:12,121
- You get there, you outpost the town.
- Sounds nice and neat, Captain.

428
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,204
Now let's go on the basis that
the joint is just crawling with Krauts.

429
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,092
I'm in there with one platoon.

430
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:24,794
What happens?

431
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,429
You take this house here in the outskirts
and you hole up.

432
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,141
We hit them with the rest of the company.
You give us a base of fire.

433
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:34,643
If we need it. Got it?

434
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:38,306
You run into any real trouble,
we'll be behind you.

435
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:40,519
I hope.

436
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:49,489
All right, if you don't like it, I'll get
Lieutenant Miller's platoon to try it.

437
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:55,417
- Are you for it, Harry?
- Joe, I think it should work.

438
00:32:57,461 --> 00:33:01,589
Toliver, we'll move the men
down the road in a platoon column.

439
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:05,759
Road's covered till about
400 yards from the house.

440
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:11,510
That last stretch I don't like.
Wide open. Could be trouble.

441
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:15,058
Only thing good about it
is it's downhill.

442
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:16,267
What?

443
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:20,098
If they're dug in, they could
give us a hard, hard time.

444
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:24,730
No use trying to crawl it.
There's no cover.

445
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:27,319
400 yards in battle gear
is too far to run,

446
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,239
so we'll walk the first half
and then we'll kick out.

447
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:36,658
And pray. What do you think?

448
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:41,170
- It could be a real, real crock, sir.
- Get the men moving.

449
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:43,918
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:53,598
That's a mighty fine platoon sergeant
you got there.

451
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:55,802
The best.

452
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,066
And he's not gonna wind up
in any wringer.

453
00:34:04,194 --> 00:34:06,400
Him nor any of the rest of my men.

454
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:10,195
- What do you mean by that?
- Just this.

455
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:15,153
We can take that house all right
but, boy, I'd hate to get stuck with it.

456
00:34:15,288 --> 00:34:20,330
- You get into trouble, we'll back you up!
- I know, I got your word on it.

457
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,829
What do you want,
a contract or something?

458
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,455
All right, come on. Don't worry.

459
00:34:27,926 --> 00:34:31,971
- You'll back me up, Harry?
- You want my word too?

460
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,507
Yeah.

461
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,384
All right, you've got it.

462
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:45,060
Maybe you'd like me to call in Jackson.
Maybe you'd like his word on it, too.

463
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:49,730
I want Jackson standing by
to receive me.

464
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:54,906
And, Cooney... I'm gonna to give you
something to think about.

465
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:58,203
If I ever lose another man
on account of you,

466
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,822
just one,

467
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,541
you'll never see the States again.

468
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,498
That's court-martial talk, soldier.
I got a witness standing right here.

469
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:14,094
Let him hear me too, loud and clear,
so there won't be any misunderstanding.

470
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:19,390
You double-cross me
like you did Ingersoll, you...

471
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:24,476
You play the gutless wonder once more
and I'll come back and I'll get you.

472
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,600
I'll shove this grenade down your throat
and pull the pin.

473
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:46,458
Here he comes.

474
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,541
Let's go!

475
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:55,753
Let's go, boys.

476
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,786
All right, end of the line!

477
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,452
Here's where the turkey shoot begins!

478
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,000
How does it look?

479
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,215
I don't know, sir. It's hard to tell.

480
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:41,259
Hey, soldier,
how'd you like to get relieved?

481
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:43,549
- What, go down there?
- Sure.

482
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:46,430
Drop dead.

483
00:36:46,563 --> 00:36:50,014
- It looks quiet.
- So does a graveyard.

484
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:52,225
That's right, Lieutenant.

485
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:57,314
You know, there's a cowboy movie
where one joker says

486
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:02,787
"Mighty quiet out there.
Too quiet," he says.

487
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:09,748
Same thing every time. It's too quiet.

488
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,202
It is too quiet.

489
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:18,758
Squad leaders. Medics.

490
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,423
That's an awful long haul, Lieutenant.

491
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,682
That's the farmhouse.

492
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:32,015
Whether we're running
into trouble or not, we don't know.

493
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:36,609
It's too far and too bare for crawling,
so it's gonna be a track meet.

494
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,228
Stay off of the road. It could be mined.

495
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:41,404
- TOLIVER: Got it?
- We got it.

496
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,736
MAN: That's an awful distance
to run... sir.

497
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,746
We're gonna walk the first half.

498
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:50,542
- You'll give us the signal?
- That's right.

499
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:54,119
We'll take off in threes,
well spread, on signal.

500
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:59,130
Five-second intervals. That oughta
put us about 10, 12 yards apart.

501
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:03,174
No bunching up, no stopping,
not for anybody.

502
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:06,638
- Medics, are you ready?
- We're ready, Lieutenant.

503
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:12,722
We don't want you at the farmhouse.
Attend to casualties between here and...

504
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:17,692
Toliver and I lead off. And Willis...

505
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:22,356
- Who's got the radio?
- Right here, sir.

506
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:29,244
- What's your name, soldier?
- Abramowitz, sir.

507
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,411
You go with us, Abramowitz.

508
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,705
- Johnson, you're calling time.
- Sir.

509
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:38,002
Keep your eye on me.
If it gets too rugged, I'll signal you.

510
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,546
I don't want to put
the whole platoon in a wringer.

511
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:45,802
I do this, you hold up
the rest of the men.

512
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:49,304
Yes, sir.

513
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,973
- All right, move out!
- First squad, move up!

514
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:56,477
- Move out in threes.
- Second squad, move up.

515
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:58,896
Come on, boys! Get out there! Let's go!

516
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,441
TOLIVER: More, Abramowitz.

517
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:08,858
MAN: Five, four, three, two, and go!

518
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:14,530
Five, four, three, two, and go!

519
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:20,119
Five, four, three, two, and go!

520
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:24,342
Five, four, three, two...

521
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:27,137
and go!

522
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:30,962
Five, four, three, two, and go!

523
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:36,770
Five, four, three, two, and go!

524
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,022
Five, four, three, two, and go!

525
00:39:43,737 --> 00:39:47,355
Five, four, three, two and go!

526
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:53,116
Five, four, three, two and go!

527
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:58,912
Five, four, three, two and go!

528
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:04,705
Five, four, three, two and go!

529
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,668
So far, so good.

530
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:09,471
If they're in there,
now's when they'll open up.

531
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,466
Yeah. We're too far out to go back now.

532
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,896
Let's go!

533
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:01,683
Medic!

534
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:07,064
No more, no more!

535
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:10,269
That's it.

536
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:36,503
(SHOUTS)

537
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:03,457
Cellar.

538
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:06,161
Cellar.

539
00:42:08,254 --> 00:42:09,832
Upstairs.

540
00:42:23,311 --> 00:42:24,722
(EXPLOSION)

541
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,105
All clear.

542
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:39,482
I got a stitch.

543
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:49,292
Watch the town.

544
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:56,461
All clear out back. Is this it?

545
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:02,552
This all that made it?

546
00:43:07,729 --> 00:43:09,010
Yeah.

547
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:31,207
I'm way out of condition.

548
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:37,459
Real bad shape. My wind's all shot.

549
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,591
You know what the cause is?

550
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:48,973
Too many cigarettes.

551
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:53,183
From now on, I'm gonna stay healthy.

552
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,853
- You're healthier than he is.
- That's for sure.

553
00:43:57,987 --> 00:44:01,403
- You're lucky it wasn't uphill.
- He'd have never made it.

554
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:05,530
- Not with all the lead he's carrying.
- That's where I want the lead.

555
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:09,077
- Nowheres else.
- Maybe he's right.

556
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:12,907
Sergeant Kelly got it in the gut.
So did Lucas.

557
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,833
- They got Lucas?
- Yes, sir. I seen him fall.

558
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:21,173
A medic ran over to him.

559
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:27,678
How about the rest of Johnson's squad?

560
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:30,928
Liegert caught one in the throat.
It looked like...

561
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:34,894
Lucky five of us got here.
They really threw it at us.

562
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:37,266
It wasn't Wiener schnitzel, huh, Sarge?

563
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:40,355
A German cook can kill you
just as quick.

564
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:44,657
Kelly. Lucas.

565
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:50,776
- You're sure about Liegert?
- Yes, sir.

566
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:54,081
I'm telling you, it's miraculous.

567
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:56,830
I don't know how I got here.

568
00:44:56,962 --> 00:45:00,959
You know what it is?
It's a miracle, that's what.

569
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:04,008
- All right.
- Absolutely miraculous.

570
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:08,797
Sending one platoon in here like that.
Plain crazy, Lieutenant.

571
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:11,849
How could he ever
dream up one like that?

572
00:45:18,024 --> 00:45:22,852
Settle down. Long as we stay here,
we ought to be OK. They won't rush us.

573
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:25,276
How do you know, sir?

574
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:30,199
- Keep watching that town!
- Yes, sir. But how do you know, sir?

575
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,368
I don't know.

576
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:39,955
But analyse it. We're boxed.
They know it.

577
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:45,545
All they gotta do is wait till
we stick up our heads, and... pow.

578
00:45:45,677 --> 00:45:49,543
- Just like plucking possum.
- So what do we do, sir?

579
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,681
We sit tight and wait
till the company attacks in strength.

580
00:45:55,811 --> 00:45:58,598
Is that what Cooney said?
That he'd back us up?

581
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:01,222
That's what the man said.

582
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,243
Well? What do you think?

583
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,583
Relax. You got here.
That means anybody could do it.

584
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:24,329
Yeah, maybe. Except Captain Cooney, huh?

585
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:28,925
Take it easy. You don't see
the lieutenant worrying, do you?

586
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,840
- Wanna know what I think?
- What do you think?

587
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:35,472
The only one who ain't worrying
is Abramowitz there.

588
00:46:36,685 --> 00:46:39,520
Snowden? The hell with being healthy.

589
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:42,102
- Give me a cigarette.
- COSTA: Shut up.

590
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,028
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One,
over to you.

591
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:49,692
Maybe he's too far, Lieutenant.

592
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,696
- Hey, Lieutenant!
- What?

593
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:54,612
- I thought I saw something.
- Where?

594
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,911
- On the road, just back of the steeple.
- What was it?

595
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:01,538
I don't know.
A tank, a turret, something.

596
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,040
- I don't see anything.
- It pulled back.

597
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,005
- That's how it caught my eye.
- A truck?

598
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:09,457
- Yeah.
- Could very well have been a truck.

599
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,083
The way our luck's going,
it's gotta be a tank.

600
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,505
If they got tanks in there,
they'll nail us to the floor.

601
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,969
- You'd make great wall-to-wall carpeting.
- COSTA: Shut up, both of you.

602
00:47:22,564 --> 00:47:25,979
Did you spot him? Ricks, you see him?

603
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,389
No, sir.

604
00:47:28,152 --> 00:47:30,311
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One.

605
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:35,239
In order to get a shot at Bernstein,
he would have to be...

606
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:44,618
Yeah, sure. See? The church steeple. That
sacrilegious son-of-a-gun is in the belfry.

607
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:46,792
How do you know that?

608
00:47:49,507 --> 00:47:51,416
Only place he can angle a shot at you.

609
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,303
- Can you see him?
- TOLIVER: Not now, I don't.

610
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:57,594
If you can't see him,
how can you get a shot at him?

611
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,846
Strategy, Bernstein.

612
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:03,474
You step out front and bring me in
what you see by the stoop.

613
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,762
- Out front?
- Move.

614
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:19,653
Fragile Fox Two to Fragile Fox One,
do you read me? Over.

615
00:48:19,786 --> 00:48:22,538
Fragile Fox One,
I read you loud and clear.

616
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:24,740
Is that you, Jackson? Over.

617
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,160
Yes, sir, it's me. Hold on, Lieutenant.
I'll get somebody. Over.

618
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:35,885
Captain, it's Lieutenant Costa
on the radio, sir.

619
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:40,056
See what's doing, Woody boy.
Go on, see what he wants.

620
00:48:40,182 --> 00:48:43,183
You know what he wants, Captain.

621
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,219
All right, bare a hand here!

622
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:47,845
Get these men in there. Take it easy.

623
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:55,236
- This is Harry. What's the score? Over.
- Where's Cooney? Over.

624
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:02,410
- Harry, the town is heavily occupied.
- Ask him if Berlin's occupied.

625
00:49:02,536 --> 00:49:05,656
Tell him Cooney's
a southern-fried schlemiel.

626
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,249
What?

627
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:14,878
What? They caught us in the open
and they chopped us up. Over.

628
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,293
- You gonna rig a dummy to draw fire?
- You wanna volunteer?

629
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:20,301
- What a screwball idea.
- Yeah.

630
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:23,265
I repeat: They chopped us up!

631
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:29,058
The medics are picking
them up right now. Over.

632
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:31,596
Put this on him.
It'll make him look real.

633
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:33,476
They are?

634
00:49:35,361 --> 00:49:38,896
- First wounded are already coming in.
- So where's the support?

635
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,487
Tell Cooney we're pinned.
I repeat: We're pinned!

636
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:53,249
Doctor, I have a man in the balcony.

637
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:58,961
Look, you tell him
we're in that little ol' house.

638
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:03,135
Tell him I lost Lucas, Kelly, Liegert,

639
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,884
I don't know how many.

640
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:08,720
So where's the rest of the company?

641
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:13,846
Where's that support that was
gonna be right behind us all? Over!

642
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:19,775
Joe, hang on. I'll call you right back.
Over and out.

643
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:20,936
Captain.

644
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:24,408
Captain!

645
00:50:26,578 --> 00:50:28,286
- Captain!
- Well?

646
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:30,986
We gotta move.
Joe is pinned. It's our turn.

647
00:50:31,124 --> 00:50:35,869
Let's make sure we make the right move.
Let's not get excited, up in the air!

648
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:39,838
- I'll have the company saddle up.
- Hold on there!

649
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:44,344
Maybe there's more to this
than we can handle.

650
00:50:48,516 --> 00:50:50,639
Come on.

651
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:54,101
Jackson, I'll take over.

652
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:02,488
What do you mean,
more than we can handle?

653
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:05,899
We're ordered to take La Nelle.
Let's form up and do it.

654
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:11,193
- The thing to do is pull 'em back.
- We can't pull back. They're pinned!

655
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,999
Then let 'em hole up!
We'll call for artillery!

656
00:51:14,124 --> 00:51:17,125
Artillery won't do any good.
It takes men to hit the town!

657
00:51:17,253 --> 00:51:21,915
Risk a whole company for the remains
of one platoon? Think straight, boy!

658
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:25,714
Think straight? I'm thinking
about the job we've gotta do!

659
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:29,510
If I've made a mistake in judgment,
it was an honest one.

660
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:35,352
Now, listen, Cooney.
I gave Costa my word.

661
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:38,978
So what are you, a boy scout?
Some kind of white knight?

662
00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:41,350
I gave him my word.

663
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:47,072
Look, soldier, to be perfectly frank,
I don't give a damn what you gave him.

664
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,117
Great-looking soldier.
He's uglier than Bernstein.

665
00:51:50,244 --> 00:51:52,402
COSTA: Hurry it up.

666
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:56,488
Wait a minute. If this sad sack is gonna
die, why don't we make him an officer?

667
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,496
- Make him a general.
- No, a lieutenant.

668
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:04,122
Make him a captain.

669
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,136
- You know who he looks like?
- No...

670
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,221
- TOLIVER: Shove it out, Bernstein.
- I'll take over.

671
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:20,390
All right, sir, go out there
and draw some lead.

672
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:32,906
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, but not enough.

673
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:35,993
- What does he look like?
- A man.

674
00:52:36,122 --> 00:52:38,162
Them cruddy Krauts.

675
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:43,629
- A little more, Bernstein.
- More?

676
00:52:43,755 --> 00:52:45,794
Come on, Bernstein.

677
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,896
Wow!

678
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:05,354
No more bats in that belfry.

679
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:11,859
- I swear, Toliver, that was shootin'!
- Just like pluckin' possum.

680
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:13,900
Toliver!

681
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:16,740
Get away from that hole.

682
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:20,244
Them cruddy Krauts.

683
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:27,169
They shoot until you're on top of them.
Then they run out.

684
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:29,967
"Kamerad. Give me Zigaretten."

685
00:53:30,092 --> 00:53:32,879
The trouble with you, Ricks,
is you're bitter.

686
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:36,261
Sure. I hate them cruddy Krauts,
if that's what you mean.

687
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,881
- Probably no more than they hate you.
- Me?

688
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:42,054
- Why should they hate me?
- Cos you're the enemy.

689
00:53:42,187 --> 00:53:47,229
What do you mean? I'm an American,
for crying out loud! They're the enemy.

690
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,443
Abramowitz. Jacob R Abramowitz.

691
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:52,610
He's got O-type blood.

692
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:57,901
That's a fine, cruddy note,
calling me the enemy.

693
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:01,322
What do you think you are?
An exchange student?

694
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:03,829
How could I be the enemy?

695
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:06,165
- Ricks!
- Yes, sir?

696
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:13,545
You leave here again,
I'll beat you bloody!

697
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:15,504
Got that?

698
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:42,909
Fragile Fox Two
to Fragile Fox One, over.

699
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,703
Fragile Fox One,
this is Fragile Fox Two.

700
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:50,326
Where's the support? Over!

701
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:05,685
Say it again, Harry.

702
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:10,023
Nice and slow,
so there's no mistake. Over.

703
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:17,188
Yeah.

704
00:55:17,323 --> 00:55:19,399
We stuck with the lease?

705
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:22,906
Yeah.

706
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:32,414
Kommen Sie out.

707
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:35,215
Raus! Raus!

708
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,167
Come on!

709
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,842
Amerikaner! Freie Menschen!

710
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:47,010
Wir sind so froh, dass ihr hier seid.

711
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:52,434
- I thought you flushed out the cellar.
- I did. They must've been hiding.

712
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:56,100
- Did you look?
- Yeah. No. Who'd have thought of it?

713
00:55:56,236 --> 00:55:59,735
Anybody with their head on!
That wouldn't be you, would it?

714
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:04,408
Get down there now and search
the whole place! Every last inch of it.

715
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:06,614
Halt deinen Mund!

716
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:10,281
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My uncle.

717
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:14,702
Er will mich bald rüberbringen,
nach Amerika. Schwartz.

718
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,459
Die Brauerei. Bitte. Das ist mein Onkel.

719
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:19,714
Halt's Maul.

720
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:27,177
The mean one's a captain.
It's the same in every army.

721
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,519
Toliver, these boys
are the answer to a prayer.

722
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:46,485
I want it real quiet now.
I'm gonna work on the old guy.

723
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:57,119
OK, you. In there.

724
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,587
In there. Panzers?

725
00:57:01,842 --> 00:57:03,550
Panzers, was?

726
00:57:03,677 --> 00:57:05,337
Come on, sprechen Sie!

727
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:08,176
Otto, ich warne dich.

728
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:11,391
Nicht sprechen Sie, understand?

729
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:13,178
Ich weiß gar nichts.

730
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:15,981
You got the old guy
scared stiff, Lieutenant.

731
00:57:16,106 --> 00:57:17,980
Any mechanised stuff in there?

732
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:19,484
Was?

733
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,069
Come on, now, sprechen Sie!

734
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:24,611
Otto, deinen Namen, deinen Rang,
deine Nummer... sonst nichts.

735
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,029
He's making with the Articles of War.

736
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:31,239
They don't apply to us.
Not in a vice like this.

737
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:40,826
This is a.45-calibre automatic, Captain.
Verstehen Sie? Nicht sprechen!

738
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,004
How about it? Panzers?

739
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:49,303
Panzers?

740
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,928
SS, huh? SS?

741
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:54,637
Ich weiß nicht.

742
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:58,304
You won't get it out of him.
Whitey's got him too scared.

743
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:03,315
Namen, Rang und Nummer!

744
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,484
Keep your mouth shut!

745
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:11,241
Panzers? Come on, now!

746
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:15,579
- Das sind...
- Otto, du Idiot!

747
00:58:15,707 --> 00:58:21,496
Du brauchst doch nur zu warten.
Im Dorf, auf dem Kirchturm, überall.

748
00:58:21,629 --> 00:58:24,167
Die sind jetzt schon tot.

749
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:26,090
Tot?

750
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:28,293
Ja, so gut wie tot.

751
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:33,474
You know what he says?

752
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,684
He says all they gotta do is wait.

753
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:41,306
He says we're covered from the town.
He says we're "tot".

754
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,479
Dead.

755
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:53,860
Got a lot of firepower
in the town, Captain?

756
00:58:55,245 --> 00:58:57,072
Tell me about it.

757
00:58:57,206 --> 00:59:02,580
I take it you are acquainted with the
covenants of the Geneva Convention.

758
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:07,290
Then you must know that
we will tell you absolutely nothing.

759
00:59:07,424 --> 00:59:08,835
(COCKS PISTOL)

760
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:28,858
Nicht! Wartet!

761
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:33,569
Es sind doch wir.

762
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:03,972
Panzers?

763
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:07,640
Panzers.

764
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:10,811
Erschießen Sie mich nicht.
Ich habe drei Kinder.

765
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:13,068
How many tanks? One? Two?

766
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,857
Wie viele?

767
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:18,573
Acht, zehn. Und SS.

768
01:00:18,703 --> 01:00:19,865
What'd he say?

769
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:24,373
He says the place is crawling
with mechanised stuff. And SS.

770
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:29,254
Ricks.

771
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:35,248
Fragile Fox Two
to Fragile Fox One, over.

772
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:43,345
Woodruff... I can't hear you.
I can't hear you. Over.

773
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,269
Louder, Harry. I can't...

774
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:47,472
Hey, look! A tank!

775
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:55,112
TOLIVER: The guy wasn't lying.
They'll flatten us.

776
01:00:55,238 --> 01:00:57,445
What a way to reduce.

777
01:00:57,991 --> 01:00:59,402
Woodruff?

778
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,408
Are you receiving me? Over.

779
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,157
OK, get this: Tanks are in here.

780
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:13,663
I don't know how many.
We're pulling out!

781
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:16,503
I repeat: We're pulling out!

782
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,296
Request artillery and smoke cover.

783
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:25,765
Repeat: Request artillery
and smoke cover. Over.

784
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,978
Roger. Fragile Fox Two out. No, wait!

785
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:36,270
I got a message for Cooney. Understand?

786
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:41,776
You tell him I'm comin' back.

787
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,199
Tell him I'm comin' back!

788
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:48,874
COSTA: Start that artillery.
Fragile Fox Two out.

789
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:00,378
B Battery, this is Fox Company.

790
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:05,014
I don't have to draw you
a picture on this one.

791
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:10,555
Keep the house between you
and the town as long as you can.

792
01:02:13,232 --> 01:02:16,767
Just let me make one thing clear.

793
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:21,315
I'm not just giving you the word,
I'm giving you the law.

794
01:02:21,448 --> 01:02:23,524
I'm giving you an order.

795
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:30,158
Don't stop for anybody. You got that?

796
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,912
No matter who gets it, you don't stop!

797
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:37,211
Get set. You're gonna
run the Kraut in front of you.

798
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:40,293
- He'll slow me up.
- You heard the lieutenant.

799
01:02:40,426 --> 01:02:45,420
- Can't we leave him behind?
- Division Intelligence will need him.

800
01:02:45,556 --> 01:02:49,091
Soon as you hear our stuff
coming over, take off.

801
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:01,772
Let's go, Bernstein!

802
01:03:01,905 --> 01:03:04,822
Like I always said,
a fighting army is a running army.

803
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,487
(SPEAKS GERMAN)

804
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:19,540
All right, now. 20-yard intervals.
Don't bunch up.

805
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:26,587
Ricks! Get a move on. Let's get movin'.

806
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:29,342
- You ready?
- Lieutenant, don't rush me.

807
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:31,597
- Hail Mary, full of grace...
- Go!

808
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:45,400
My Jesus! Mary!

809
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:53,205
Snowden!

810
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:56,909
Take this.

811
01:03:57,043 --> 01:03:59,285
- See you around, Lieutenant.
- Go.

812
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:03,337
Don't you wait around too long
after I'm gone.

813
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,837
I'll still beat you up that hill.

814
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:09,171
- You're talking to a flying Toliver, Joe.
- Yeah?

815
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,344
Get out of here.

816
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,942
Toliver!

817
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,938
The Lord is with thee.

818
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,728
Blessed art thou among women.

819
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,734
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

820
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,445
Amen.

821
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,221
- Lieutenant?
- Where are you hit?

822
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,857
I don't know. The chest or lungs.

823
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,109
Feels like bubbling.

824
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:57,195
Maybe you shouldn't, Lieutenant.
You'll never make it.

825
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,338
Lieutenant?

826
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:19,593
Remember when you hit me back there?

827
01:06:19,724 --> 01:06:22,215
- Don't talk.
- You were right.

828
01:06:22,352 --> 01:06:24,558
I fouled up...

829
01:06:26,147 --> 01:06:28,852
But I understood what you meant.

(MAN GROANING)

831
01:06:58,805 --> 01:07:01,510
- These men, sir...
- What?

832
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,889
These men...

833
01:07:06,146 --> 01:07:09,016
The sergeant, poor guy...
Right in the face.

834
01:07:09,149 --> 01:07:10,429
Jackson!

835
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,941
- Yes, sir.
- Shut up.

836
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,443
- Yes, Captain, but these...
- Shut up!

01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:19,649
(MAN GROANS IN AGONY)

838
01:07:24,246 --> 01:07:25,575
Captain!

839
01:07:26,665 --> 01:07:31,244
Sergeant Toliver is coming up the street!
He's got a German with him!

840
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:38,921
Well, where'd you get the Kraut?

841
01:07:39,053 --> 01:07:42,753
Brought him back
from that "little ol' house".

842
01:07:46,936 --> 01:07:48,975
Bring him along.

843
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:54,521
- Where's Lieutenant Costa?
- He was the last to run for it.

844
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:59,693
I waited for him in the draw over the crest
of that hill, but he never did show up.

845
01:07:59,823 --> 01:08:03,239
- They must've gotten Ricks, too.
- How long did you wait?

846
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:07,069
Long enough for 'em both to show
if they was gonna.

847
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,413
OK, bring him inside.

848
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:43,605
- Division?
- MAN: This is Division.

849
01:08:43,741 --> 01:08:46,067
This is Fox Company. We have a prisoner.

850
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:48,693
What about those tanks?

851
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,237
- How many?
- I saw two.

852
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:54,743
Prisoner says there's all kind
of mechanised stuff in there.

853
01:08:54,878 --> 01:08:58,709
Prisoner reports at least two tanks
in La Nelle, maybe more.

854
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,585
- Get the prisoner over to G-2.
- We'll send him by Jeep right away.

855
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:13,764
Had those tanks started to move
when you pulled out?

856
01:09:13,897 --> 01:09:16,767
No, sir. But they sure is shooting now.

(EXPLOSIONS)

858
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:46,374
How about it, Toliver?
What were Lieutenant Costa's chances?

859
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:51,719
I don't know, sir. It was mighty wide open.
Feels like he just didn't make it.

860
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:55,763
One of the best platoon leaders
I ever had.

861
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:58,601
You stinking Nazi.

862
01:09:59,983 --> 01:10:02,653
- Don't do that!
- That's for Costa, you squarehead!

863
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:06,692
- Take it easy! He's been cooperating.
- (EXPLOSIONS)

864
01:10:20,379 --> 01:10:23,878
- Come on, Toliver, I'll buy you a drink.
- No, thank you.

865
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:27,423
- Thought you were a drinking man.
- Not now, sir.

866
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:32,763
This here's bourbon, Toliver.
This is real Kentucky bourbon.

867
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:37,930
I never heard of a true Southerner
refusing a Kentucky bourbon. Here.

868
01:10:38,062 --> 01:10:40,434
No, sir. Thanking you kindly.

869
01:10:41,899 --> 01:10:44,224
What's the matter, boy? Come on.

870
01:10:47,154 --> 01:10:52,113
Captain, down where I come from,
we dearly love our whiskey.

871
01:10:52,243 --> 01:10:56,371
But we don't drink with another man
unless we respect him.

872
01:11:01,752 --> 01:11:04,706
Well, go dry. Your loss.

873
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:09,541
I've got transportation for...
What happened to him?

874
01:11:09,677 --> 01:11:13,093
Nothing a little more of
the same wouldn't cure.

875
01:11:13,222 --> 01:11:16,425
- Take him up to Division.
- Crummy, no-good Nazi.

876
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:20,762
- They're hitting some of those houses!
- OK, OK!

877
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:25,059
- Sound like 88s.
- You think so?

878
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,684
- Now we got big trouble.
- They won't attack.

879
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:30,358
We got companies each side.
Sector's pinched off.

880
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:31,984
It is not! Take a look.

881
01:11:32,116 --> 01:11:36,243
- You don't need to show me no map!
- They're gonna knock us out of here.

882
01:11:36,369 --> 01:11:38,611
That leaves two companies out on a limb.

883
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:41,664
Once they've got the crossroads,
we're all up the creek!

884
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:45,326
Don't get excited!
I was soldierin' when you were...

885
01:11:45,462 --> 01:11:47,419
The worst thing to do is get excited!

01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:51,210
Sir, them's 88s.

888
01:11:51,343 --> 01:11:54,047
All right, what are
we gonna do now? Huh?

889
01:11:58,433 --> 01:12:01,767
- Round up what's left of your platoon.
- Yes, sir.

890
01:12:02,854 --> 01:12:06,389
- All right, now what? What, Cooney?
- There's only one thing to do.

891
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:09,609
Fall back. Miller's platoon
can hold till we make the woods.

892
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:12,488
- How do they get out?
- We'll cover them.

893
01:12:12,614 --> 01:12:15,401
- They wouldn't have a prayer.
- I'm in command here!

894
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,409
- Face the facts!
- That's what I'm doing!

895
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,706
- What the hell is going on here?
- Clyde!

896
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:27,372
- They've got tanks!
- Don't you "Clyde" me.

897
01:12:27,504 --> 01:12:29,911
- Colonel, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, all right.

898
01:12:30,048 --> 01:12:33,049
- Why aren't you up in La Nelle?
- I tried!

899
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:35,963
- What does that mean?
- I sent a whole platoon in!

900
01:12:36,096 --> 01:12:39,879
That's 40 men. You got 200 men.
You sent in a platoon? What happened?

901
01:12:40,015 --> 01:12:42,471
They got in, but they pulled out.

902
01:12:42,601 --> 01:12:45,396
- How many got in?
- Five. Three got out.

903
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:47,951
- I told them to stay.
- Of course they pulled out.

904
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:51,498
- How many casualties?
- About 10. Five dead. Costa's missing.

905
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:56,419
- He'll be OK. He's got nine lives.
- But, Clyde, I spotted those tanks.

906
01:12:56,548 --> 01:13:00,795
I was all set to go in. I was feeling
them out with Costa's platoon.

907
01:13:00,928 --> 01:13:05,222
You were ordered to get in there!
The generals thought you were in there.

908
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:08,634
I told them you were in there.
What will you do now? Pull out?

909
01:13:08,769 --> 01:13:11,805
- You can't hold that...
- You'll stick here and hold!

910
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:15,355
- How many tanks?
- There's all kinds of mechanised stuff.

911
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:20,111
A task force is on its way. If the Krauts
get through, the whole battalion gets it.

912
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,278
You hold until you're relieved.

913
01:13:22,408 --> 01:13:26,275
- How long will this take?
- Who cares? I want this position held.

914
01:13:26,412 --> 01:13:29,448
- There's something you've gotta do.
- We'll hold.

915
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:32,286
It's about the command of this company.

916
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:36,250
Get outta here, Woodruff.
I want to talk to your captain.

917
01:13:37,548 --> 01:13:38,710
Go on, move!

918
01:13:46,597 --> 01:13:50,097
- That's bonded liquor, Clyde.
- I want you to listen to this.

919
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,262
Listen real closely
in case it's news to you.

920
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:57,061
You're commanding this company
only as a favour to the judge.

921
01:13:57,191 --> 01:14:00,774
- He's always wanted a son.
- I don't want no favours.

922
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:06,609
You got one chance. You're in hot water.
You hold this town, I'll cover for you.

923
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:09,779
But you fall back,
I'll show you what trouble means.

924
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:12,664
- I'll hound you into Leavenworth!
- You can count on me!

925
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,622
No, I can't! So it boils down to
what scares you most, me or them.

926
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,959
Listen to this!

927
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:22,173
You foul up, so help me
I'll crucify you!

928
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:31,093
You know what? I couldn't care less.

929
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:33,265
You know that?

930
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:36,680
You're so big. Why don't you relieve me?

931
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:45,857
Yeah. Go on, send me back.

932
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,278
Make no nevermind of me.

933
01:14:48,408 --> 01:14:50,650
- How I'd love to.
- All right!

934
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,529
Do it! Do it!

935
01:14:52,663 --> 01:14:56,910
Sure. I send you back, they'll take
a close look at you. Very close.

936
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:59,615
And they'll see me perched
on your shoulder.

937
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:03,751
That's right, Erskine boy.
So here you stay, here you hold.

938
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:05,709
Why will I?

939
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:12,005
- You all through talking?
- How I hate you.

940
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,845
Colonel, you're not gonna
leave him in command here.

941
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:20,145
I don't care what your opinion
of Captain Cooney is.

942
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:23,524
- He's still in command. Clear?
- Very clear.

943
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:27,187
- Then you know what you have to do.
- I know exactly what I have to do.

944
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:31,154
- You double-talking me?
- I'm not double-talking anyone!

945
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:35,578
If I survive this, I'm going to General
Parsons. I'll tell him the whole story.

946
01:15:35,706 --> 01:15:39,075
About Aachen, about Costa,
about his plan to pull out of here.

947
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:41,665
I just want you to know it.

948
01:15:51,804 --> 01:15:55,138
When 10th Armored gets here,
I want that crossroad open.

949
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:05,984
Come on, Captain. Let's go. We'll set up
at the two houses at the crossroads.

950
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:08,601
We gotta hold. We gotta hold.

951
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:14,242
We'll hold as long as we can, then fall
back to the church, then the courthouse.

952
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:17,488
- And then what?
- That's the end of the line.

953
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:21,952
Come on, get your gear.
Let's go. Come on.

954
01:16:25,004 --> 01:16:27,210
No, you give me that.

955
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:31,883
I was soldiering when you were still
a kid. You ain't taking nothing from me.

956
01:16:32,011 --> 01:16:35,095
Captain, you won't find
any answers in there.

957
01:16:35,222 --> 01:16:38,638
- Just give me that.
- You can't find courage in a bottle.

958
01:16:38,768 --> 01:16:43,145
You can't buy your guts for a dollar.
Who do you think you are?

959
01:16:43,272 --> 01:16:46,606
You're not just careless or a coward.
You're a criminal!

960
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:50,150
A criminal responsible for
the murder of at least 19 men!

961
01:16:50,279 --> 01:16:52,319
Give me that!

962
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:53,646
There!

963
01:16:54,825 --> 01:16:58,573
You've got every man in this outfit
thinking the US Army is a mockery.

964
01:16:58,703 --> 01:17:01,953
It's not! Just this tiny,
lousy part of it.

965
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:05,083
From hereon in, it's gonna be different.

966
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:12,422
I'd like to go out there and stop one,
but I haven't even got the guts to...

967
01:17:15,011 --> 01:17:19,839
A man hasn't got the guts to live,
he hasn't got 'em to die.

968
01:17:19,975 --> 01:17:23,426
If you can't live, you can't die.

969
01:17:23,561 --> 01:17:27,855
Who wants this? I didn't ask for this.

970
01:17:30,694 --> 01:17:33,611
I'm different, Woodruff.

971
01:17:33,738 --> 01:17:35,778
I'm scared.

972
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:39,985
We're all scared, Captain.

973
01:17:41,913 --> 01:17:45,958
I'm scared of... I'm scared of you.

974
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:49,868
I'm scared of Bartlett. I'm scared...

975
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:55,298
I'm scared of my father.

976
01:17:57,262 --> 01:17:59,669
My daddy whupped me! He whupped me!

977
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:03,672
"I'm gonna whup some guts into you, boy!
I'll make a man of you!"

978
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:07,012
"I'm talking to you, boy!
I'll make you a man!"

979

(WEEPS)

980
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:17,439
And I thought that someday... someday...

981
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:26,324
I woke up one morning,
and I was 30 years old.

982
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:32,202
I knew that little ol' someday
was never gonna come.

983
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:37,007
Never gonna be no someday.

984
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:40,716
Never gonna...

985
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:55,726
You stay here, Captain.
I'll take care of things.

986
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:05,781
- Where is he?
- Joe. Where...? How did you get back?

987
01:19:07,538 --> 01:19:11,157
Where's Cooney?
They said he's here. Where?

988
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:18,376
- Back there?
- Joe, listen to me.

989
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:21,380
Now, don't foul yourself up.

990
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:25,386
- Get outta my way.
- No.

991
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:28,762
Liegert's dead! Lucas is dead!

992
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:32,143
Ricks is dead! A boy I never
even talked to is dead!

993
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:35,806
All on account of him!
That's one account I'm gonna square!

994
01:19:35,942 --> 01:19:39,726
You can't do this! He's...
I don't know. He's psycho. He's...

995
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:41,902
I'm gonna count to three...

996
01:19:42,031 --> 01:19:46,658
You kill him, you'll go back to Battalion
under guard. I'll see to that.

997
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:50,914
- Listen to me for once!
- Why should I listen to you?

998
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,453
You're mealy-mouthed.
You double-crossed me!

999
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:00,132
- You gave me your word!
- It wasn't that simple.

1000
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:03,128
OK, if you want it this way! One...

1001
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:06,841
Harry, I'll shoot you if I have to!

1002
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:08,799
Two...

1003
01:20:11,518 --> 01:20:14,721
- One of those big Kraut tanks!
- Where?

1004
01:20:14,855 --> 01:20:19,600
It's firing point-blank into the house
where Toliver and the other guys are.

1005
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:23,602
- All right, Joe, how about it?
- Those guys don't have a chance!

1006
01:20:27,826 --> 01:20:29,866
Lieutenant Costa...

1007
01:20:31,121 --> 01:20:33,244
I thought you were dead.

1008
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:39,582
- Which house is it?
- At the end of the street.

1009
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:48,762
Can you make it on that leg there?

1010
01:20:48,889 --> 01:20:52,305
I'll make it. There and back.

1011
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:26,628
Them ever-loving momsers
are trying to kill us.

1012
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:31,884
- We gotta get down that cellar.
- Toliver, you got a mind like a steel trap.

1013
01:21:35,017 --> 01:21:36,809
Argh!

1015
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,113
- You all right?

1016
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:43,073
Lieutenant! Hey, Joe!

1017
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,292
- I'm glad you...
- Where are the others?

1018
01:22:53,428 --> 01:22:55,800
Snowden's in the cellar.
Bernstein's here.

1019
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,552
I think he's got himself a busted leg.

1020
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:04,348
- Get them below, out of the way.
- Look out. Here comes another one!

1021
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,168
Argh!

1022
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:06,801
(SCREAMS IN AGONY)

1023
01:25:22,116 --> 01:25:25,568
He yells nice and loud, don't he?

1024
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,194
You know I do, you grease monkey.

1025
01:25:37,214 --> 01:25:40,749
Whoever thought
I'd be glad of a busted leg?

1026
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:44,087
You know what this is, don't you?

1027
01:25:44,221 --> 01:25:47,886
It's a one-way ticket, stateside.

1028
01:25:48,016 --> 01:25:50,092
Want your plugs changed, too?

1029
01:25:51,103 --> 01:25:55,729
No, thanks, Sarge.
But you can check my windshield.

1030
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:57,980
It's getting a little misty.

1031
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:04,983
Come on! They're breaking through.
We're falling back to the church.

1032
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:07,033
(GUNSHOT)

1033
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:12,449
Don't leave me here. Those guys are SS.

1034
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:19,003
- We'll get you some kind of stretcher.
- Them SS don't take wounded prisoners.

1035
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:22,215
Especially when their name is Bernstein.

1036
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:25,427
- What we need is Superman.
- You know it, Snowden.

1037
01:26:25,554 --> 01:26:29,967
- Or even that Joe Costa.
- Yeah, Costa. I wonder where he is.

1038
01:26:34,605 --> 01:26:39,349
You're yellow, all of ya! We're holding
for Clyde! Come out, you cowards!

1039
01:26:39,483 --> 01:26:43,896
Yellow! Come out! I'll fight ya!
Come out, wherever you are!

1040
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:47,149
We're holding for Clyde!
We're holding the town!

1041

Come on! I'll fight! Come on!
You're yellow, yellow, yellow!

1042
01:26:57,168 --> 01:26:59,789
Come on, snap it up, will ya?

1043
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,376
- What happened to him?
- I busted my leg.

1044
01:27:02,506 --> 01:27:06,290
- Carry him. Come on, they're coming.
- We're trying to rig a stretcher.

1045
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:10,425
Hurry it up. You'll be all right, Bernstein.
I'll get up to see if it's clear.

1046
01:27:10,556 --> 01:27:12,549
- Come on.
- Try it.

1047
01:27:12,683 --> 01:27:17,808
You take it easy, you guys. I'm the only
guy in the world who could do this.

1048
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:19,730
- Do what?
- Crap out on a seven.

1049
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:24,234
- What do you mean?
- I bust my leg. That's a natural, right?

1050
01:27:24,362 --> 01:27:28,110
- Stateside for certain.
- So I win, so I pick up the chips.

1051
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,028
And what are we playing for?
A drop-dead pill.

1052
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:37,699
I almost wish I wasn't wounded.

1053
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:40,703
WOODRUFF: Come on, hurry it up.

1054
01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:43,872
What's going on here?
Where are you men going?

1055
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:48,418
- Nobody's running out! We're holding!
- We'll hold at the church and courthouse!

1056
01:27:48,551 --> 01:27:52,086
We weren't told we were!
You ain't telling me, I'm telling you!

1057
01:27:52,222 --> 01:27:54,428
- WOODRUFF: He's nuts.
- Get back!

1058
01:27:54,557 --> 01:27:56,680
Cooney, you're blocking progress!

1059
01:27:59,562 --> 01:28:03,607
Get back there! You're yellow!
All of you! Get back there!

1060
01:28:03,733 --> 01:28:07,565
Too late. They're all around the place.
Get back down.

1061
01:28:10,282 --> 01:28:14,196
Geradeaus. Die erste Kompanie
zu den rechten Häusern.

1062
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:18,076
Ich soll auf
die amerikanischen Panzer aufpassen.

1063
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,958
Wo willst du denn hin?

1064
01:28:22,085 --> 01:28:24,327
Ich wollte mal im Keller nachgucken.

1065
01:28:24,462 --> 01:28:26,122
Dass du dich besaufen kannst?

1066
01:28:26,256 --> 01:28:27,964
Nur nachsehen, das ist alles.

1067
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:31,341
Mach dir keine Sorgen,
da ist kein Schnaps mehr übrig.

1068
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:37,174
Wenn noch welcher da wäre,
würde ich ja selbst runtergehen.

1069
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:39,100
Komm.

1070
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:04,452
We're cut off here.

1071
01:29:04,585 --> 01:29:06,743
I'm aware of that, Captain.

1072
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:11,671
The way I see it, we're trapped.
This situation's hopeless.

1073
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,004
- Sh!
- There's only one thing to do.

1074
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:17,675
- And what's that?
- Surrender.

1075
01:29:17,806 --> 01:29:22,267
- The Geneva Convention...
- Listen. They don't even know we're here.

1076
01:29:22,394 --> 01:29:26,724
As officer in charge, I'm still
the one giving the orders...

1077
01:29:26,857 --> 01:29:29,265
- You're sick.
- ...and don't you forget it!

1078
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:32,106
- (YELLS)
- Shut up!

1079
01:29:32,237 --> 01:29:36,567
If the SS can't march Bernstein back,
you know exactly what they'll do.

1080
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,907
I'm doing the officer-like thing.

1081
01:29:40,245 --> 01:29:42,285
I'm trying to save lives.

1082
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,526

01:30:28,459 --> 01:30:32,327
- Joe.
- Your arm, Joe.

1090
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,957
Time to settle up.

1092
01:31:47,653 --> 01:31:49,776
give me the strength...

1093
01:31:54,118 --> 01:31:56,739
just... just to do this.

I gotta...

01:32:19,225 --> 01:32:23,270

He didn't mean it.

Well, that being over, I think
we'll just carry on as planned.

and I'll kill you.

Let's not fly off the handle here.

Let's calm down.

of line is gonna get it right in the head.

- Take a look.

- Did you hear me?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

- The Krauts got the captain.
- Absolutely.

Let's just all forget about it.

Now, look here, son...
I mean, Lieutenant.

1131
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:12,943
What's happened here...
I mean, what's really happened,

1132
01:37:13,073 --> 01:37:15,861
and how it's gonna
sound in a court martial...

will railroad you.

but the army,

well, it just got no sentiment.

1137
01:37:28,004 --> 01:37:33,343
Speaking of justice, shooting him was
about the most just thing I've ever seen.

1138

He was about to get us all killed.

majority will make you look like a maniac!

had lived long enough to do it.

You wouldn't have turned him in.

1142
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,904
- Costa didn't do it. I did it.
- That so?

01:38:32,234 --> 01:38:35,270
Now who killed him? You or me?

1144
01:38:35,404 --> 01:38:38,855
Or me? Or Jackson there?

1145
01:38:40,784 --> 01:38:42,990
He was already dead.

1146
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:47,034
How do you know, Lieutenant?
You can't be sure.

1147
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:54,004
Man, he sure caught a storm of lead
at the top of them stairs, didn't he?

1148
01:38:54,131 --> 01:38:58,923
Yeah, six fat Huns
driving a 1919 Stutz Bear Cat.

1149
01:39:00,095 --> 01:39:01,210
- Tanks!
- No.

1150
01:39:01,346 --> 01:39:04,964
Yes. But they're ours! The 10th
Armored's here! The Krauts are gone!

1151
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,425
Yonkers, here I come!

1152
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:21,772
So long, Joe. You were a real soldier.

1153
01:39:22,409 --> 01:39:24,615
Nice man.

1154
01:39:25,704 --> 01:39:29,405
I sure hope things turn out the way
he would've wanted them to.

1155
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:34,000
Come on, the colonel's on his way over.

1156
01:39:34,128 --> 01:39:37,497
You hear that?
The colonel's coming. You hear me, sir?

1157
01:39:37,632 --> 01:39:41,416
He'll be sorry about how them Krauts
got poor Captain Cooney.

1158
01:39:41,552 --> 01:39:44,470
He'll be mad at them
for what they did to his friend.

1159
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:46,755
The fortunes of war, Lieutenant.

1160
01:39:49,143 --> 01:39:52,061
Lieutenant, how did you get cut off?

1161
01:39:52,188 --> 01:39:56,933
We were trying to get a wounded man out.
They came up faster than I expected.

1162
01:39:57,068 --> 01:40:01,017
Bad judgment. You got a great company.
I asked them to hold and they did.

1163
01:40:01,155 --> 01:40:04,156
- Who is that? Costa?
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:40:04,283 --> 01:40:06,821
Where's your captain?
I want to congratulate him.

1165
01:40:06,953 --> 01:40:09,194
He's over here, sir.

1166
01:40:14,126 --> 01:40:18,539
I'm putting you in command. Don't get
separated from the company again.

1167
01:40:18,673 --> 01:40:22,373
- What happened to him?
- He was shot.

1168
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:23,589
Down here?

1169
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:28,512
He tried to get back to the company,
but only made it to the top of the stairs.

1170
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,969
- Died like a real soldier, did he?
- Yes, sir.

1171
01:40:33,104 --> 01:40:35,309
He certainly did, sir.

1172
01:40:37,607 --> 01:40:40,644
- You hurt bad, son?
- No. A million-dollar wound.

1173
01:40:40,777 --> 01:40:43,980
- Good deal. Give the States my regards.
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:48,277
Send out the grave detail and
get this man over to Battalion A.

1175
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:58,167
See you later, Lieutenant?

1176
01:40:58,295 --> 01:41:02,873
I'll notify Battalion and Division
about your being the new CO.

1177
01:41:03,008 --> 01:41:06,792
- All right, sir?
- TOLIVER: All right?

1178
01:41:13,852 --> 01:41:14,931
OK.

1179
01:41:16,062 --> 01:41:18,850
See you later.

1180
01:41:32,162 --> 01:41:34,735
You see it personally, Woodruff?

1181
01:41:35,874 --> 01:41:37,119
Yes, sir.

1182
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:41,579
- He was at the top of the stairs, huh?
- Yes, sir.

1183
01:41:41,712 --> 01:41:45,792
- Then he rolled back down here.
- Yes, sir.

1184
01:41:46,717 --> 01:41:51,509
You're a good officer, Woodruff.
I'm glad to see you got this company.

1185
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:56,514
Maybe I'll put through a field promotion
for you. I want a captain in command.

1186
01:41:59,355 --> 01:42:01,846
If that's what you want, sir.

1187
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:05,398
Funny what you were
saying to me before about, uh...

1188
01:42:05,527 --> 01:42:08,943
going to General Parsons
over something or other.

1189
01:42:09,073 --> 01:42:14,613
A man'll say all kinds of things, do all
kinds of things under strain, won't he?

1190
01:42:16,622 --> 01:42:19,742
But I never heard you.

1191
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:22,538
So the old judge wanted a son, huh?

1192
01:42:25,756 --> 01:42:29,006
Looks like he had to lose
one to get one.

1193
01:42:29,134 --> 01:42:31,210
You know what I'm gonna do?

1194
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:34,548
I'll put Erskine through
for Distinguished Service Cross.

1195
01:42:34,682 --> 01:42:38,382
I'll write up the papers and send them
around for your signature...

1196
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:40,179
Captain Woodruff.

1197
01:42:40,312 --> 01:42:43,098
You have no objection, have you?

1198
01:42:43,231 --> 01:42:46,481
Old Erskine died like a hero, didn't he?

1199
01:42:49,696 --> 01:42:55,485
- You're gonna push me too far.
- Woodruff, it's a little piece of ribbon.

1200
01:42:55,618 --> 01:42:58,785
What's that against a rope
around a dead man's neck?

1201
01:43:00,915 --> 01:43:04,580
It's not a dead man's neck, Colonel!
It's mine!

1202
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:07,498
Yes, my neck!

1203
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:11,462
- Don't get excited.
- You played it too far. Way too far.

1204
01:43:11,593 --> 01:43:15,839
Now it's phoney medals for the judge
with my signature on the citation!

1205
01:43:15,972 --> 01:43:20,266
It's not gonna be that way.
I killed him. And that's no simple...

1206
01:43:20,393 --> 01:43:24,521
You're high-strung, Woodruff!
You need a couple of weeks' rest.

1207
01:43:26,357 --> 01:43:30,189
Maybe I'll put through a little leave
for you. A couple of weeks in Paris...

1208
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,736
- TOLIVER: Down here.
- Come back a new man.

1209
01:43:37,368 --> 01:43:40,155
There they are. One in each room.

1210
01:43:49,796 --> 01:43:52,881
Come back with your new bars on.
Your own company.

1211
01:43:53,008 --> 01:43:56,258
Life can be very pleasant, Harry.
Even in a war.

1212
01:44:00,974 --> 01:44:04,675
Take a look at me, Colonel.
Take a good look at me!

1213
01:44:06,188 --> 01:44:09,604
I may have pulled that trigger,
but you aimed the gun.

1214
01:44:09,733 --> 01:44:12,687
You set this whole thing up
so it could happen.

1215
01:44:12,819 --> 01:44:16,153
- They'll smell you out on this.
- Nobody will smell a thing.

1216
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:21,358
You got the high hand now, son,
the big cards. You'll play it smart.

1217
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:30,915
Your worries are over.
The captain's gone.

1218
01:44:44,851 --> 01:44:50,771
He was a good man. Don't see no reason
why we can't get a citation for him, too.

1219
01:44:51,941 --> 01:44:53,934
- That makes it all OK?
- Get flexible!

1220
01:44:54,068 --> 01:44:56,737
You know what a court martial
would do with this?

1221
01:44:56,862 --> 01:44:59,947
So what are you gonna do,
let a dead man destroy your life?

1222
01:45:00,074 --> 01:45:02,647
Understand, there's no hard feelings.

1223
01:45:03,411 --> 01:45:06,495
I know you, Harry. You got horse sense.

1224
01:45:09,166 --> 01:45:12,286
You won't tell General Parsons a thing.

1225
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:14,745
You got too much to lose.

1226
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:25,929
See you around, Harry.

1227
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,203
You know what I've gotta do, Joe.

1228
01:46:34,876 --> 01:46:36,952
You'd do the same thing.

1229
01:47:06,115 --> 01:47:10,409
This is Fragile Fox One.
I want Division Headquarters.

1230
01:47:10,536 --> 01:47:12,612
MAN: This is Division.

1231
01:47:12,746 --> 01:47:17,871
This is Lieutenant Harold Woodruff,
White Battalion, 2nd Regiment.

1232
01:47:18,002 --> 01:47:21,418
- I want to talk to General Parsons.
- Will you wait, please?

1233
01:47:21,547 --> 01:47:23,586
Yes, I'll wait.

1234
01:47:28,596 --> 01:47:32,428
General Parsons speaking. Hello? Hello?

1235
01:47:32,558 --> 01:47:34,965
This is Lieutenant Harold Woodruff.
