from the Octopus, sir.</i>

on the next pass, sir.

like it's gonna change.

- It's called drowning.

You said we'd almost be
there three hours ago.

worked out for you.

Hey, don't fall asleep.

644

[Sputters] I'm just so relaxed.

645
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:51,915
You never did tell me what
part of Texas you were from.

646
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:55,786
Probably 'cause I'm from Reno.

over again in your head.

If I hadn't, I'd still be
on the R.H.I.B. with them.

659

Then you'd be lost out there.

660

And what good would that do us?

661
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,808
Maybe they wouldn't be lost.

662
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,644
Maybe I could've done something.

663

A thousand hours of training
for five minutes of pure chaos.

664
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:42,492
And then a thousand hours
of second-guessing yourself.

- Woman: Roger, Saberhawk One.

I just came from the lab.

671
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:06,883
The girl has a gene mutation
that makes her immune.

672
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:09,686
Dr. Scott injected her blood
into the monkey and if it works,

673
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,823
we may have the vaccine.

674

Well, everybody did their job.

675

The doctor is wondering
if she can join us in here.

676
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:24,701
She's concerned about the
captain and Tex, obviously.

677

- Shh, shh.

00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:45,741
Do they have a body?

685
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,524
I don't know. The radio
keeps cutting in and out.

686
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:48,859
I missed some of the words.

687
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,461
- Well, what words did you get?
- They said "drowned."

688
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,664
I swear to God, if you're lying to me,

689
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,099
I will strap you to a torpedo.

00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:57,734
It's what I heard.

We can't trust anything we hear.

The Russians know we're listening.

694
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:14,618
They could be deliberately
feeding us bad intel.

Sir, if you mean to do this,

696
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,927
then I recommend we have
a Helo fly low zigzag

697
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:20,441
to make it harder for
someone to track it.

698

- That'll burn a lot of fuel, sir.
- Yes, it will.

699
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:25,729
But it means we've got enough time
to make one more short pass.

700

Man: Roger. Visibility nil.

708
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,581
They're out there. They've
got to be out there.

709
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,249
Man: This is Saberhawk One.

710
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:21,618
We see something reflecting on
the surface to the southwest.

711
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,454
Taking a closer look. Over.

712
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:25,666
Man: Dropping down to 90 feet.

713
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:32,729
Roger. Right side, light chop.

714
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:44,407
[Helicopter approaching]

715
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:46,510
You hear that?!

716
00:39:48,446 --> 00:39:53,216
Hey! Hey! We're here! We're here!

717
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:57,320
Don't tell me, you're
pissed at slattery now?

718
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:58,788
Son of a bitch.

719
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:03,693
Man: In sight, engaging
automatic approach,

720
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,830
standby to lower the harness. Roger.

721
00:40:06,832 --> 00:40:09,633
[Pinging]

722
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:18,083
[Blades whirring]

723
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:20,769
Aah! Whoo!

724
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:22,496
You first!

725
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:26,558
Not a chance! You
first, Captain! I insist!

726
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:35,834
[Helicopter blades whirring]

727
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,987
What is that?

728
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,488
What the hell?

729
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,789
It's not them.

730
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,891
Man: Roger. No sign of survivors.

731
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:08,133
Come on.
