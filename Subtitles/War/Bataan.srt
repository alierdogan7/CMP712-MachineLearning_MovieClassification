1
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,251
- That's a monkey, Jake.
- Yeah.

2
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:37,178
I missed him, anyway. I'd hate
to have hit him by mistake for a Jap.

3
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,088
- Let's go, boys.
- What?

4
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,150
Yeah. We're movin' out again.

5
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,163
Too bad we can't quit retreatin'
and make a stand this time.

6
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,062
Yes, it is too bad.

7
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,167
We've already moved half way
down the Bataan Peninsula.

8
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,171
- We can't back up further.
- Not without gettin' our feet wet.

9
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,299
Sergeant, you and Corporal Feingold
are to report to Captain Lassiter...

10
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,311
...of the 26th Calvary about
the special duty you volunteered for.

11
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,171
Better get started.

12
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:06,115
It won't seem like the same war
without you around in my outfit.

13
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,244
I heard any place you're at,
it's the same war.

14
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,257
It's not right when the infantry
takes orders from the calvary.

15
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,156
That's because you're prejudiced.

16
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,126
Wound?

17
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,117
Bunion.

18
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,289
Maybe we ought to take this thing
along with us, huh, Jake?

19
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,159
I think you got somethin' there, Sarge.

20
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,193
It saved our lives this time.

21
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,073
Soldier!

22
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,054
Holy Mack!

23
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,283
If that stuff had blown up, it would've
knocked those planes out of the sky.

24
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,152
I get your point.

25
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,202
That's Captain Lassiter over there
in front of the hospital.

26
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,136
Wait.

27
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,050
So long. See you down south somewhere.

28
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,149
- So long, Lieutenant.
- Good luck, boys.

29
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,321
- You in on this too, Soldier?
- Yeah, I guess I am.

30
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,121
Do you know this Captain Lassiter?

31
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,225
No, I don't. You see, us engineers
don't mix much with the cavalry.

32
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,237
By the time they get here
we're usually gone, and vice versa.

33
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,145
- Captain Lassiter?
- Yeah?

34
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,216
Sergeant Bill Dane, 31st Infantry.
Reporting for duty.

35
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,084
Private Francis Xavier Matowski,
3rd Engineer Battalion.

36
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:34,090
Corporal Jake Feingold.
4th Chemical Company.

37
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,254
Feingold?
Excuse me a minute, Captain.

38
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,290
Feingold, I can't see your name on the list.
- Lost my squad, Captain.

39
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:16,132
Hitched up with the 45th,
and got shot loose from that outfit.

40
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,195
So, here I am.
I got a little tired of bein' an orphan.

41
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,173
If the Captain's got any work,
I'd sure like to get it.

42
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,176
He served four hitches with the regulars.

43
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,075
All right, we can use you.

44
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,272
You join up with the patrol in the grove.

45
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,148
Up the slope, against the cliffs.
That will be our center of operations.

46
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,120
Good spot. You men better
get on over there.

47
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,052
Okay, Sergeant.

48
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,290
- I asked for my own sergeant, naturally.
- Yeah.

49
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,089
A sniper got him a couple of hours ago.

50
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,102
I wish I knew you better, Sergeant.

51
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,135
This is the first time I've met the Captain.

52
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,165
Well, so we start even.
What's your record?

53
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,077
Two enlistments, no serious demerits.

54
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,082
Takes handling,
it says in the company book.

55
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,242
I got out of West Point in '40.
We'll get along.

56
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,309
Our orders are to demolish this bridge
to prevent a breakthrough.

57
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,112
Our job to keep the Japs from moving
their tanks and artillery here.

58
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,144
Stop 'em any way we can.

59
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,180
- For how long?
- For as long as we can.

60
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,294
The idea is General MacArthur
needs time to reorganize...

61
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,296
...and consolidate down below.

62
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,061
If the Japs can flank our main army
by pouring heavy stuff...

63
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,126
...through this pass, the Battle of Bataan's
going to be all over too soon.

64
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,039
That's our patrol, Sergeant,
over there in that grove.

65
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,270
We've got some natural advantages.

66
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,207
Being up on that shelf ought to give us
some protection.

67
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,118
That cliff at the back ought
to help us a lot.

68
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,124
Here's the detail.

69
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,063
Any of the names familiar?

70
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,191
Yeah, a few of 'em.

71
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,166
Well, they're a mixed crew.

72
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,071
All experts in their own line.

73
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,072
They've never served together before.

74
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,304
This assignment isn't going to be easy
on anybody, Sergeant.

75
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,172
Are you satisfied?
Can you handle the men?

76
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,306
Well, if the Captain thinks so.

77
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,106
We'll get along.

78
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,243
Oh, Captain!

79
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,274
Captain Lassiter!

80
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,185
What'd you do with your plane?

81
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,089
She's in the grove, all stowed away
and camouflaged.

82
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,218
Lieutenant Bentley,
5th Interceptor Command.

83
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:58,024
This is Corporal Katigbak,
Philippine Army Air Force.

84
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,329
They'll be staying with us for now
till we get our ship in the air, and if.

85
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,060
The Lieutenant'll want to borrow two men
to help work on his ship.

86
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,072
Better check the patrol now.

87
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,046
How'd you like to draw them in a raffle?

88
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,316
''Are any of the names familiar to you,
Sergeant?'' says the Captain.

89
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,216
What difference does it make
what their names are?

90
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,194
Three months ago they were all selling
shoes or punching adding machines.

91
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,263
Do you see a soldier in that lot?

92
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,061
I said ''soldier.''

93
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,302
You can't always tell.
Some of those kids learn pretty good.

94
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,099
Kind of quick.

95
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,052
My name's Dane. Bill Dane.

96
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,284
You can call me Sergeant.
That'll be easy to remember.

97
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,066
All right, fall in over here.

98
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,171
I said, fall in!

99
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,177
At ease.

100
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,208
We'll have a few minutes to organize
before the Japs send their planes.

101
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,083
When they report back, we'll have
a little more time to get organized.

102
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,246
So, let's get organized.

103
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,248
Sound off, Sailor.
Name and classification.

104
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:10,251
Name's Leonard Purckett. Musician,
2nd Class, United States Navy, sir.

105
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,063
We don't say ''sir'' to sergeants
in the Army, Sailor.

106
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,096
How'd you get here?

107
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:20,104
I started from Cavite by boat
but the Japs laid a few eggs on the boat...

108
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,231
...so what there was left of us swum.

109
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,300
I kind of lost the other boys somewheres...

110
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,278
...and then, first thing I knowed,
I was here in the Army.

111
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,181
I joined the Navy to see the world.
Reckon this is still part of it.

112
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,152
Fine. We want to know
all the interesting facts about you.

113
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,246
Well, sir, before I joined the Navy
I was an usher in a movie...

114
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,157
...and played in our town band. And...

115
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,185
...this here's my cornet.

116
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,287
I'm glad you brought that.
Where are the rest of your sidearms?

117
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,266
- Hang 'em onto you.
- Yes, sir. I mean, Sergeant.

118
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:53,128
Yankee Salazar, Private,
4th Engineer Battalion, Philippine Scouts.

119
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,173
It seems to me I saw you box somewhere.

120
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,040
Maybe Thanksgiving,
Manila Olympics Club?

121
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,136
I fight the windup.
Knocked him out in the fourth.

122
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,045
Yeah, I was there.
You did a nice, handy job.

123
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,051
Matthew Hardy, Private.
12th Medical Battalion.

124
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,189
Felix Ramirez, Private.
Provisional Tank Corps.

125
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,090
- National Guard?
- Yeah.

126
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,150
192nd Tank Battalion...

127
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,091
...California.

128
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,164
Wesley Eeps, Private.
3rd Engineer Battalion.

129
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,165
You're quite a hand at demolition.

130
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,226
Had no complaints from officers.

131
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,262
We got the explosives necessary
to fix the bridge?

132
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,104
Private Matowski and me made
a special collection.

133
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,135
We didn't get time for signed requisitions
for some of what we collected, Sarge.

134
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,114
As long as you collected enough
right stuff there'll be no kick out of me.

135
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,152
You men served together quite awhile?

136
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,279
- Only since December 1.
- Where are you from?

137
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,319
Pittsburgh, Pa. And I sure will be
glad to get back.

138
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,123
Malloy, Sam.

139
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,160
Motor Transport Service.

140
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,031
Cook.

141
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,101
Present.

142
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,335
Corporal Jake Feingold,
4th Chemical Company, U.S.A.

143
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,179
Barney Todd, Corporal,
Provisional Signal Battalion.

144
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,147
Todd?

145
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,114
Yeah, Todd. T-o-d-d, two d's.

146
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,310
How long you been in?

147
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,213
I enlisted in San Francisco,
February 5, 1941.

148
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,248
Volunteered for duty in the Philippines,
September 11, 1941.

149
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,292
Anything else you'd like to know?
I'm sure Captain Lassiter can tell you.

150
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,225
I was attached to his troop in Lingayen.

151
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,117
Relax. That's reconnaissance,
not bombers.

152
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,248
Patrol present and accounted for.

153
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,224
All right, Sergeant.
Give the men their orders.

154
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,252
We're going to blow that bridge.

155
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,288
When the Japs get here,
they'll try to rebuild it.

156
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:04,063
We'll keep on blowing it up.
This is where we stay.

157
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,228
Got good cover.
It'll be hard to get at us.

158
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,207
We can do a lot of harm to the Japs
when they come out in the open.

159
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,234
We got lots to do and little time.
Step out as I call your names.

160
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,272
Hardy! Malloy! Get that stuff stored away
then break out your entrenching tools.

161
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,080
Strengthen defenses
as and where you can.

162
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,055
Feingold! Salazar! Set the machine guns
up. Train 'em to cover the bridge.

163
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,318
Shoot at anything that moves.

164
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,183
Todd, Eeps, Matowski, Ramirez...

165
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,129
Pack that demolition stuff
down at the bridge, on the double!

166
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,123
Purckett!

167
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,228
Get in the way as little as possible.

168
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,232
Put that gear on!

169
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,219
- How long have you been out here?
- About two years.

170
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,155
I've been here four months.

171
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,090
Anytime you get an idea
while we're together on this job...

172
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,062
...give your orders to the men.

173
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,223
You don't have to waste time
asking me first...

174
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,233
...tryin' to make me look good.

175
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,259
And anytime I give an order
that sounds wrong to you, tell me why.

176
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,267
We'll get things done better
and easier that way.

177
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,298
That sounds fine to me, Captain.

178
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,121
Todd?

179
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,244
Yeah?

180
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,091
First hitch in the Army?

181
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,026
I was a little young for World War I.

182
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,323
You could've made it.

183
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,260
You keep reminding me...

184
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,293
...of a guy I knew a few years back
right after I joined up.

185
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,304
Yeah?

186
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,198
His name was Burns.

187
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,098
Burns?

188
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,076
Yeah, Dan Burns, or so he said then.

189
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,041
He was a corporal.

190
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,205
Same as me.

191
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,045
Yeah, same as you.

192
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,268
I don't think that's healthy, Corporal...

193
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,281
...smoking close to the stuff
we just scattered around here.

194
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,180
That'll worry me? What you think?

195
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,275
Get rid of it!

196
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,120
- All right, men, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge!

197
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,140
Hey, Sarge, whatever become of this guy
you say I look like?

198
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,243
I'd like to know.
Sooner or later I'll find out.

199
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,189
I'll personally see to it that he stands up
on a parade-ground scaffold and hangs.

200
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,261
- Like he should've done seven years ago.
- What'd he do?

201
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,061
Killed a boy who took him in a stud game,
buck private in our outfit.

202
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,259
Shot him in the back.

203
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,093
I had the MP detail right then,
so I took this Burns in charge.

204
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,037
That was a break for him.

205
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:04,099
I felt kind of sorry for him, same as
I would for any soldier who gets in a jam.

206
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,244
He double-crossed me, went over the hill.

207
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,109
That's too bad.

208
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,214
Yeah.

209
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,255
Yeah, his getaway cost me my stripes
and my chance for Officers' School.

210
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,223
You got quite a little against him.

211
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,258
Enough.

212
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,219
He probably knows that.

213
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,285
Sure he does.

214
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,255
Well, you know...

215
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,290
...if I was you...

216
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,124
...and this... Burns?
- Burns.

217
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,033
If he comes around me again,
I'd look out for him.

218
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,129
I figure to.

219
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,037
He's liable to try to knock you off
to keep you from turnin' him in.

220
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,273
I don't know. His kind, as long as
you don't turn your back on him...

221
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,110
...they don't do a thing.

222
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,047
Well, then you're okay.

223
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,210
That's what I figure.

224
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,191
- Check the lines?
- Yeah, they're okay.

225
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,226
Hold it, Todd!

226
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,353
Sergeant, the men better
not drink this water

227
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:09,154
till I chlorinate it in the Lister-bags.

228
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,074
All right, no drinking from this.

229
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,045
Make sure there's always plenty
of purified water available.

230
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,310
What's the matter? Those nasty little Japs
poison our water by remote control?

231
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,111
They don't need to. There are enough
germs in this stuff to poison the lot of us.

232
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,312
You heard the orders?

233
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,051
Yeah, you're easy to hear, Sarge.

234
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,096
All set, Captain.

235
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,083
All right.

236
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,262
Solid!

237
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,172
- Good job.
- Yeah.

238
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,279
We must have enough fire power
to keep them from rebuilding that bridge.

239
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,015
That depends.

240
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,054
On how long we stay here?

241
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,317
We'll stay as long as any of us
can stand up.

242
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,252
We may get orders to withdraw very soon,
and we may not.

243
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,256
I think we'll be able to do our share.
That's all anybody's asking of us.

244
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,137
We can make this place fairly comfortable.

245
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,106
So relax, men,
and get some rest while you can.

246
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,153
Cease firing, Sailor!

247
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,149
Hold your fire till you've got a target!

248
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,137
Eeps, Hardy, get your shovels.

249
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,164
Take positions. Don't fire without orders.

250
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,268
I don't think there are enough Jap snipers
to rush us this soon, but there might be.

251
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,176
All right, get going.

252
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,119
Keep your heads down
or you'll get 'em knocked off.

253
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,212
See what I mean?

254
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,026
Yankee, get over with the Sailor.
He needs you more than Feingold.

255
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,289
Better hurry that up.

256
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:51,063
Can't hurry too much
putting a soul underground, Sergeant.

257
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,017
Hey, Todd!

258
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,316
They're out there, not over here.

259
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,064
Listen, you guys...

260
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,297
...what happened over there
was no accident!

261
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:31,132
You better know right now those
no-tail baboons out there are ichiban jozu.

262
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,305
Meaning No. 1 Skillful.

263
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,076
They climb trees better than monkeys.
Got the best trees marked on their maps.

264
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,116
They can live and fight for a month on
what wouldn't last one of you two days!

265
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,228
All I want to do is get me a Jap.

266
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,297
Just one Jap.

267
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,045
I wish something would move.

268
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,212
- You better make him last.
- Oh, gum, I got plenty of.

269
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,095
Look, I'll be back in a minute.

270
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,094
If you see any Japs,
save one for baby, will ya?

271
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,066
Japs, we got plenty of.

272
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,238
There ought to be a cross, hadn't there?

273
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,045
I could make one.

274
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,150
Yeah, do that.

275
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:51,087
I got chalk too, if you'd want me to print
the Captain's name and rank on the cross.

276
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,215
All right, Sailor.

277
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,127
Medical Corps' duty to check effects
and belongings before burial.

278
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,038
Didn't they tell you
that was part of your job?

279
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,072
Here's his stuff.

280
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,073
Put it in your report
that Captain Lassiter was married.

281
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,054
- Cigarette, Sergeant?
- Thanks.

282
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,070
- You and the Captain were...
- Yeah.

283
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,129
You ever run across a little nurse out here
named Elsie MacAlester?

284
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,157
Yeah, I put her on that last
Red Cross truck going out.

285
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,298
I had a date with her once in Manila.

286
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,106
She was a nice kid...

287
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,136
...from Kansas.

288
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,206
I sent her a Spanish shawl for Christmas
but I don't suppose she ever got it.

289
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,216
Guess the Japs got that when
they grabbed the Manila Post Office.

290
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:39,095
She and Captain Lassiter
were married yesterday.

291
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,033
Supposed to be a secret.

292
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,039
Guess he had to tell somebody.

293
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,302
Didn't she know any better?

294
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,299
What do you think you're gonna
do with that?

295
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,102
I thought it'd be the right thing
if I'd blow taps for the Captain.

296
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,305
It might be if this was Arlington Cemetery.

297
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,149
Forget it. I said forget it.

298
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,217
Here, put that on your noggin
and glue it there.

299
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,060
What's on your minds?

300
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,191
Well, I think somebody ought to
at least say a few words.

301
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,169
All right. Speak your piece.

302
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,300
Not me, Sergeant.
Eeps here can do it better.

303
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,233
You a preacher back home?

304
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,277
I was studying to be, Sergeant.

305
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,101
All right.

306
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,214
Heavenly Father...

307
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,283
...Captain Lassiter was our captain...

308
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,061
...and he was a good captain.

309
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,288
He did his job and kept on doing it
as long as he could.

310
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,296
He died a long ways from home.

311
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,130
His folks probably won't ever know
where we buried him.

312
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,070
But we reckon he was prepared for that.

313
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,144
As long as we know
that what comes out of graves...

314
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,081
...is the best part of what
goes into them...

315
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,118
...we know he's all right.

316
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,025
''Blessed are the pure in heart...

317
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,287
''...for they shall see God.''

318
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,625
Amen.

319
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,200
Amen.

320
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,229
All right, break it up.

321
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,048
Here you are, Malloy.

322
00:29:57,062 --> 00:30:00,054
Where I come from, you only take
medicine when you're sick.

323
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:04,125
As long as the quinine lasts, it may
keep you from getting sick with malaria.

324
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,025
Taste bad?

325
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,037
Not when it's in a capsule.

326
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,143
The Sergeant sure is a hard man, ain't he?

327
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,115
I'll bet you could strike matches
on the back of his neck.

328
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,085
According to history, wars are started
by corporals and won by sergeants.

329
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,079
I claim they're won by everybody
that puts on a uniform and gets shot at.

330
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:29,055
When a good man like the Captain
gets killed...

331
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,324
...I don't see why the Sergeant
won't let me blow taps.

332
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,088
It'd be just the decent thing to do.

333
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,223
Look, kid...

334
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,292
...blow your horn all you want to.

335
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,095
I like a good tune on the horn, myself.

336
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,039
But there'll be no taps.

337
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:47,043
Those monkeys know what ''taps'' means
and I don't want 'em keeping score on us.

338
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,112
- You got it clear in your mind now?
- Yes, sir, Sergeant. I got it.

339
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,052
The Sergeant's a sensible fellow at that.

340
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,086
Just have to get to know him, that's all.

341
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,284
That'll take you a long time, Junior.

342
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,062
Lieutenant?

343
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,090
Yes, Sergeant?

344
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,263
You want to pick your men now, or shall I?

345
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,076
I think you better give the orders,
Sergeant.

346
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,207
You see, I'm just a stowaway
on this trip.

347
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:29,084
Until and if I can get my plane in the air,
I'll take orders from you like the rest.

348
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,280
Isn't that the best way to handle it?

349
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,119
I wouldn't say no.

350
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,026
Doesn't make sense though, a $40,000 pilot
getting killed in the infantry.

351
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,223
I hadn't exactly figured on gettin' killed.

352
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,293
Go ahead, Sarge.
You pick 'em and I'll kibitz.

353
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,132
Any of you guys claim to be mechanics?

354
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,075
Hey, Sarge, back home I built
my own jalopy.

355
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,237
Everything is strictly
out of secondhand junk...

356
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,282
...but, boy, he goes 80 miles an hour
like nothing.

357
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,251
I didn't finish telling you, Sarge.

358
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:04,186
Before I was an usher and played
in the band, I done some work in a garage.

359
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,087
You've been a busy boy.

360
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,284
Well, yeah, I got around some.

361
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,118
- Think they'll do, Lieutenant?
- Fine.

362
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,322
I'll need you later.
I'll yell for you when I'm ready.

363
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,225
Now listen, you guys,
I'm gonna make a speech.

364
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,291
We'll make it my first and my last.

365
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:23,038
Some of you might not like the way
I wear my tin hat or somethin'.

366
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,034
Well, I didn't pick you either.

367
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,239
As long as nobody changes
Captain Lassiter's orders...

368
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,147
...the orders stand the way you heard 'em.

369
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,310
You all volunteered,
or you wouldn't be here...

370
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,284
...so we'll call off the volunteering
from now on.

371
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,293
Gonna be a lot of odd jobs
to be done around here.

372
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,254
Some dirty jobs.

373
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:49,224
I'll decide what's to be done and when, and
I'll pick the men to do it. That'll be that.

374
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,265
Don't all of you be stepping up, making
your pitch for a medal volunteering.

375
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,034
It'll just waste my time and yours.

376
00:32:56,241 --> 00:33:00,143
The smartest thing you can do is
to take it easy. Don't get excited.

377
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,146
If you got nothing to do, write letters.

378
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,239
I'm glad you mentioned that, Sergeant.

379
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,052
I've been sayin' all along
that we ought to write home oftener.

380
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,177
You're right, Sailor.

381
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,018
You're dead right.
That's what we oughta do.

382
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,149
Those poor civilians are havin'
a tough time...

383
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,286
...havin' to give up their gas
and tires and sugar...

384
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,122
...and havin' to buy bonds.
We gotta keep up their morale.

385
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,161
Thanks for giving us your views
on the subject, Corporal.

386
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,297
Now get this straight and don't forget it:

387
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,201
If one of you lays down on the job
he's assigned to...

388
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,143
...he'll put the rest of you
right on the spot.

389
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,077
Don't let that happen.

390
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,207
You're in charge of ammunition
and ordinance.

391
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,015
How many grenades
and how much dynamite we got?

392
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,317
- Give me a report before you go off duty.
- Okay, Sarge.

393
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:50,056
Hardy, start issuing regular preventive
doses of quinine to each man immediately.

394
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,097
- I already have, sir.
- That's fine. How's the supply?

395
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,291
About enough for four days,
minimum dosage.

396
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,101
Malloy, how are the groceries?

397
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,194
The groceries?

398
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,030
I'll tell you, there ain't no sugar
for the coffee...

399
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,041
...and there ain't no coffee.

400
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,044
There's maggots in the meat,
and the meat is mule.

401
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,170
Mule?

402
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,141
Yeah, mule.

403
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,211
If you hold your nose, it's all right.

404
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,252
Issue plenty for tonight.
Start rationing tomorrow.

405
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,022
I'll do that.

406
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,221
All right, boys, come and get it.

407
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,040
Any action out there?

408
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,306
I ain't seen nothin',
and I ain't heard nothin'.

409
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,278
But you can bet they're out there,
thicker'n fleas on a hound dog in Georgia.

410
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,013
What's the matter, Sarge?

411
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,144
You in a hurry?

412
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,279
I can wait.

413
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,185
Thought I might relieve Eeps here
while he gets his chow.

414
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,160
That is, if it's okay with you.

415
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,098
Thank you, Lieutenant,
but I don't feel hungry now...

416
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,193
...but Matowski over yonder,
he's always ready to eat.

417
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:09,171
- I'll send Matowski in.
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

418
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,256
I never touch the stuff.

419
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,274
Don't tell me that's Jap jive!

420
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,168
No, Sarge, no.

421
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,009
That's good old America.

422
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,236
That's U.S.A.

423
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,210
Well, music with our meals! Fancy.

424
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,156
That's Tommy Dorsey, from Hollywood!

425
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,029
He sends me, Sarge!

426
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,259
He makes me lace up my boots!
Oh, brother!

427
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,193
Keep blowing, Tommy, keep blowing.

428
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,162
Oh, boy, he's tall tonight, he's tall.

429
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,009
Yeah, talk to me, talk to me.

430
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,206
Give me some of that trombone talk,
Tommy.

431
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,221
Sarge, what's a man do
when he gets took with remorse?

432
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,130
- That depends on what about.
- About this.

433
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,296
I knew a mule, used to beat his ears down,
and for all I know this is him.

434
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,165
He's getting even with you?

435
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,232
That's why I got remorse.
I toughened that mule too much.

436
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,007
Some day I'm going to get back
to Pittsburgh.

437
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,105
Every Monday my mom makes
lima bean soup with vinegar.

438
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,178
Get him. He can mention a mess like that
and turns his nose up at this.

439
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,149
Which one of you guys claims to be
any good at climbing trees?

440
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,125
Come on.

441
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,170
Which tree, Sarge?

442
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,271
Pick a tall one. Get as high up as you can.

443
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,283
It's too dark to see, but I got a hunch...

444
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,282
...a big concentration of Jap heavy stuff is
over there across the ravine by now.

445
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,221
See what you can spot.

446
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,106
Yep.

447
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,036
That's two.

448
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:32,057
Purckett, Ramirez, front and center.

449
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,162
Relieve Todd on No. 1 machine gun.

450
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,236
On your feet. Grab a weapon
and get in one of those foxholes.

451
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,075
Break out the tommy guns.

452
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,309
Jake, issue each of them
a couple of pineapples.

453
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,121
Don't let these drop on your foot.

454
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,213
Yeah, they are heavy.

455
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,055
The idea is to use 'em. Don't waste 'em.

456
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:06,095
- You ever handle one of these before?
- We never had any of these in our outfit.

457
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,189
You pull this,
this and the gun'll do the rest.

458
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,200
Except in case when it jams.

459
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,135
- What if it jams?
- Write a letter to your senator.

460
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,264
If anything breaks, I suggest
you get back there as fast as possible.

461
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,263
Right.

462
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,105
You two, go with the Corporal.

463
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:23,306
If the moon gets higher the Japs'll see you,
so space out ten feet apart. Hug the cliff.

464
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,045
Don't shoot unless you're shot at.
All right, get going.

465
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,967
If anything breaks up, don't let it
interfere with

466
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:31,268
your work unless we yell for help.

467
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,314
- Right, Sergeant, good luck to you.
- Thanks.

468
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,094
You and me are going for a walk.

469
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,096
Yeah?

470
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,031
This guy, Burns, I was tellin' you about...

471
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,131
...he used to pitch for Company A.
Had quite a hop on his fast one.

472
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,162
No foolin'?

473
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,304
Have you had any experience
throwin' these apples?

474
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,072
Yeah, I been in the Army awhile.

475
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,208
That'll save me havin' to show you how.

476
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,086
Yankee, reverse the gun over there
where the bridge was.

477
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,097
Better have an extra belt ready.

478
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,328
You men...

479
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:26,166
...Corporal Feingold here
is in full command until I get back.

480
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,077
You gotta go lookin' for trouble?

481
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:32,138
You'd better check with Lieutenant Bentley
before you make any move. That's in case.

482
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,205
Okay, Sarge.

483
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,118
When we start layin' these eggs,
fire at will to cover us.

484
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,251
We'll angle over to the right.
It's good cover down that way.

485
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:49,255
Then we'll work back up along the edge
of the ravine as far as we can.

486
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,101
All right, come on.

487
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,241
Go ahead, Sarge.

488
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,321
This guy, Burns,
used to toss 'em left-handed.

489
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,152
Is that so?

490
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,221
You know...

491
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,136
...that's a funny thing.
I'm a southpaw myself.

492
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,156
- Hold it!
- But they need us up yonder!

493
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,182
The Sergeant'll sing out when he needs us!
Get back on the job.

494
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,264
Sulfanilamide powder
and a piece of adhesive tape.

495
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,252
How bad's he hurt?

496
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,264
Lost a quarter of an inch of heel.

497
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,196
Well, that he can spare.

498
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,132
We're like ducks in a shootin' gallery.

499
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,997
Do you suppose those guys might get
discouraged and call this party off, Sarge?

500
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:08,203
No, they'll snipe us by daytime
and paste that bridge together by night...

501
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,110
...until it's across.

502
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,149
They don't get discouraged.
They got plenty of time.

503
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,117
Yep, they set the clock.

504
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:19,086
What's the matter, Sarge?

505
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,286
I'm wonderin' how long these guys
can stand up to this stuff.

506
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,254
They've done all you told 'em,
neat and proper so far.

507
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,230
They haven't been here long yet.

508
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,165
If they were real soldiers, Jake,
it'd be different.

509
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,226
The way it is, I'm wondering
if headquarters wouldn't say...

510
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:38,037
...we did good enough even if I ordered
to pack up and get out of here tonight.

511
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:42,135
We could be a long ways by morning,
associating with a better class of people!

512
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:46,078
I don't think you'll give
any kind of an order like that.

513
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,252
Those kids signed up for this
just like you and me.

514
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,181
They'll get tired, sure.
Things'll get tough, sure.

515
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,698
But they won't put their tails
between their legs...

516
00:49:57,798 --> 00:50:00,029
...and run any more than you would.

517
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,214
What do you think you're doing?

518
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,082
Plenty Japs over there, tanks, artillery.

519
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,150
I go tell General MacArthur.
He sends planes...

520
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,124
...planes drop bombs on Japs!
Bang! Fourth of July!

521
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:31,261
I can make it, Sarge.
I know this piece of country all over.

522
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,159
- Born around here?
- Oh, no.

523
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,100
I'm Moro from Mindanao,
but when I am little kid...

524
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,070
...my old man is traveling salesman
for sewing machines.

525
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,037
This piece of country
very good territory for him.

526
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,234
I go along to keep the
dough for my mom.

527
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:49,304
Because when my pop drinks the coconut,
he's loco in the coco.

528
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:53,116
They got a dollar down,
dollar when you catch 'em, even here.

529
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,151
One dollar down, you bet.

530
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,085
If the collector has to catch you...

531
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,246
...no more coco!

532
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:03,282
I come from onetime
very murdering family, Sergeant.

533
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,322
- So long. See you in the funny paper.
- Wait.

534
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,155
Get your clothes on and get civilized again.

535
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,190
Somebody got to go tell the General.

536
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,068
That'll do a lot of good,
tellin' the General.

537
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,196
What's the matter, Mister?

538
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,141
Look, Joe, the General ain't got any planes.
He ain't gonna get any.

539
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,134
If I was you, I wouldn't say that.

540
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:26,148
I reckon the U.S. Is sendin' help
as best as they can, as fast as they can.

541
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,079
Oh, sure, sure.

542
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,277
Help that don't exist is on the way.

543
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,215
Private, lead us in three rousing cheers!

544
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,125
Sarge, you better bury
the rest of us face down...

545
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,220
...so we don't keep lookin' up
for the planes that ain't coming!

546
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:44,257
Sergeant, I gotta bust one of your orders.
Come on, get on your feet, Todd.

547
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,071
Why not?

548
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,196
Might as well get this over right.

549
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,263
At ease!

550
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,141
You spoke your piece.

551
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,042
All right, sit down.

552
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,114
Come on, sit down, both of you!

553
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:01,206
Yankee...

554
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,021
I hope he gets to talk to the General.

555
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:18,257
Oh, boy! It sure is a fine,
pretty morning, ain't it?

556
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,262
Reminds me of how the sun came up
when I was a cowpuncher once...

557
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,137
...out west in Texas.

558
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,079
Of course, we never had
none of this kind of fog out there.

559
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,039
That's something else I've done
in my past. I punched cattle once.

560
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:41,018
- What's the matter with you?
- Just tired. Long night we put in.

561
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:45,085
No, sir. I'm no doctor, but I worked
in a drugstore once. You're sick.

562
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:49,098
Don't you go saying that!
Don't you say that to anybody! I mean it!

563
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,158
What do you want to get mad for?
If a man's sick, he's sick.

564
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,067
It's no disgrace that I know of.

565
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,038
Don't you tell the Sergeant.

566
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,266
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

567
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:02,108
It's time to get back.
Get your stuff and let's get movin'.

568
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,179
Yes, sir.

569
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,301
What we've done look all right?

570
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,303
Fine. It's a good night's work.

571
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,271
Is she anywheres near ready to go?

572
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,103
No, not quite yet.

573
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,144
Say, Lieutenant? Lieutenant?

574
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,148
Do you reckon if we was to lay down
and cork off awhile...

575
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,083
...the Sarge'd be too put out?
I mean, after we check in.

576
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:45,282
I'll tell him you did a hard night's work
and deserve a little sleep.

577
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:49,053
I guess us men could use
a little rest, couldn't we?

578
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,193
- 'Morning, Sergeant.
- 'Morning, Lieutenant. How'd it go?

579
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,139
Rome wasn't built in a day.
It says in the book.

580
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,167
That was a nice job you did on the bridge.

581
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,041
Yeah, it turned out okay.

582
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,068
Lieutenant.

583
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,048
Sergeant.

584
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,309
These men had kind of a tough night.
I think they could use a little sleep.

585
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,179
All right. Right after inspection.

586
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:22,082
All right, men. Fall in over here.

587
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,223
All right, front and center. Everybody up.

588
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,234
Jake, you stay on your gun.

589
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,102
How's the heel?

590
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:39,142
I feel fine. How are you?

591
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,038
Say, Sarge, where's Salazar?

592
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,046
He took a walk.

593
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:46,242
Now, look, Junior,
you got all day to hear the news.

594
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:50,117
- Sergeant, what about Corporal Katigbak?
- I haven't seen him.

595
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:52,178
He came back to work on the carburetor.

596
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,213
I sent him in about an hour ago.

597
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,186
As you were, men.

598
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,247
Katigbak!

599
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:17,140
Hardy!

600
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,152
I'd say he's been dead about...
about an hour, Sergeant.

601
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,124
Get back in line. You too, Private.

602
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,293
One thing at a time!

603
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,229
All right, fall in.

604
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,308
- What's the matter with you, Soldier?
- Nothin'. I'm fine.

605
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,110
Hold still.

606
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:07,122
Coming down with this for days?

607
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,215
No, sir, Sarge.

608
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,194
Well, I had the shivers.

609
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,130
The shivers, then the shakes.
Hot, cold, and hot again.

610
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,033
I've had malaria myself. I know it.

611
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,100
I ain't sick.

612
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,260
Take charge of him.

613
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,167
But I ain't sick, Sergeant.

614
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,139
You need a little rest
and some double shots of quinine.

615
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,233
Eeps, Malloy, take care of Katigbak.

616
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,202
You others, get on your guns.
Keep your eyes open.

617
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,247
Purckett, get in with Feingold.

618
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:46,051
I don't know whether you know it,
but that was a Samurai sword, Lieutenant.

619
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,289
- Officer?
- Yeah.

620
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:52,100
Probably get in close enough so he knows
exactly how many men you got left.

621
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:57,062
Won't be long before they hit you with
everything they can get across that ravine.

622
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,098
When'll the plane be ready to take off?

623
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,305
The Corporal and I figured we'd need
a few more night's work, but...

624
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,108
...we don't have much time.

625
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,138
Don't crack her up
before you're off the ground.

626
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:09,117
I'll know what the chances are
after tonight.

627
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,219
Okay.

628
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:37,070
Don't seem possible Salazar could have
got there so quick.

629
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,207
Depends upon how far he had to go
and how fast he traveled.

630
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:44,118
Yeah, and if he caught up to the General.

631
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,155
What do you want to say that for?

632
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:54,128
Those are Japs! Everybody down!
Hug the ground!

633
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,038
But I thought them was Japs!

634
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,233
I think they are.

635
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,215
Malloy! Malloy, get back there!

636
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,249
Get down!

637
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,201
Look at that! Malloy got him!

638
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,238
Malloy, I take back everything
I ever thought against you! You're okay!

639
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:45,036
I told you, Sarge.

640
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,237
That guy's gotta know somethin' better
than he knows how to cook!

641
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,139
Hold it.

642
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,277
Back on your guns.

643
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,066
Nothing you can do for him now, Private.

644
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,267
Can't you stay off your feet
like I told you to?

645
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,298
I feel much better.

646
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:24,309
When I want you, I'll let you know!
Now get back into bed and stay there!

647
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,241
Turn your radio on. It might do us all good
to hear some music.

648
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,152
But the battery is only good
for a few hours.

649
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,148
I wouldn't want to use it up too fast.

650
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,320
It's your radio. Do what you want with it.

651
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:43,265
Hey, you, I thought I told you
to look after him!

652
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,294
What have I got to do, put it in writing?

653
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:56,077
You're off duty, Sailor.
Jake, take charge of this gun.

654
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,112
Okay.

655
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,051
Sarge!

656
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,144
Sarge! First Jap I've seen,
right out there in the open!

657
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,179
He's just standin' there askin' for it!

658
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,282
Okay, Mr. Monkey, you're gonna get it!

659
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,123
No, Sarge, he's my Jap!

660
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,219
That's no Jap!

661
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,232
You got fog in your eyes, Sailor.
Take another look.

662
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,174
That's Salazar.

663
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,249
Yeah.

664
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,244
What's left of him.

665
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,180
The Japs probably got him last night.

666
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,292
Worked on him a long time
before they finally strangled him...

667
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,294
...and put him out of his misery.
- Shut up!

668
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:47,324
Take it easy, Sailor. Relax.

669
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,257
You need a little rest.

670
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:10,081
Dirty... dirty... dirty... dirty!

671
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,092
Pobre mamaciya...

672
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,192
He's talkin' Spanish. Talkin' of his mother.

673
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:13,105
Jitterbug kid, shakin' himself to death.

674
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,289
Sergeant.

675
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,222
Sergeant!

676
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,259
Lay still, boy. Lay still.

677
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,220
I'm solid, Sarge...

678
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,154
...honest.

679
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,325
Sure, you are.

680
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,175
Padre Manuel.

681
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,210
Padre Manuel.

682
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:55,085
Take it easy, Soldier. Take it easy.

683
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,192
Si, Padre, si.

684
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:01,027
Yes, Father, I remember.

685
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:03,029
I learned it by heart...

686
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,063
...just like you say.

687
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,037
Thinks he's talkin' to a priest.

688
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,138
''Confiyeor Deo omnipoyenyi...

689
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,266
''...beayae Mariae semper Virgini...

690
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,202
That ain't Spanish now.

691
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,180
''...beayo Michaeli Archangelo...

692
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:24,210
That's Latin. I taught Latin in high school,
back in Kentucky.

693
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,120
''...sancyis Aposyolis Peyro ey Paulo...

694
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:31,251
''...omnibus sancyis, ey vobis
frayres quia...

695
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,263
''...peccavi mimis cogiyayione...''

696
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,164
''I confess that I have
sinned exceedingly...

697
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,193
''...in thought, word and deed.

698
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,134
''Through my fault...

699
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,204
''...through my fault...

700
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,039
''...through my most grievous fault.''

701
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,134
- What's the matter, Sergeant?
- Got the same thing he had, haven't you?

702
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,263
Any quinine left?

703
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,265
Gave the last of it to the kid, huh?

704
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,106
That's fine.

705
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:27,148
According to the papers from the Captain
you enlisted as 1-A-0, non-combatant.

706
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,117
Wouldn't kill anybody else.

707
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,083
That's fine. Fine!

708
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:37,249
Stay in here and take it easy.
You don't have to stand inspection.

709
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,194
Eeps will take care of him.

710
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,227
The kid?

711
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,229
Yeah.

712
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,170
Tell Eeps, will you?

713
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:01,079
And tell the Sailor when he comes in.

714
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:05,084
In case he doesn't know
how to spell the name.

715
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,222
R- a-m-i-r-e-z.

716
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,216
First name, Felix.

717
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,151
Okay, Sarge.

718
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,058
- 'Morning, Lieutenant.
- 'Morning, Sergeant.

719
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,229
- How's it, Sailor?
- Oh, fine, Sarge.

720
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:26,207
I got used to workin' nights
when I was a cab driver in Kansas City.

721
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,107
'Course, I slept days.

722
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,076
Okay. Go lay down for a while.

723
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,113
Oh, no, Sarge.

724
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,205
No, go on, go on.

725
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,181
Well, okay, if you say so.

726
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,211
How's the plane?

727
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,256
I'll try a takeoff tonight.

728
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,284
Think you'll make it?

729
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,023
Yeah, I think so.

730
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:50,255
Those Japs know what you've been up to.
No use givin' them too much of a target.

731
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,259
When you're ready,
we'll open up from here.

732
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:58,035
The noise of our firing ought to cover
the motors's sound when you take off.

733
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,176
I've got an alternate suggestion, Sergeant.

734
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:09,117
It seems to me that your patrol has done
about all that can be done.

735
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,119
I suggest that you abandon
all but necessary equipment.

736
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:18,116
We'll find some way to stow the men
aboard the plane.

737
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,288
Thanks, Lieutenant.

738
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:26,227
I'd like you to take Private Hardy there.
He needs doctors, medicine, hospital...

739
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,139
You go along too, Sailor.

740
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,144
Me? Oh, no, sir, Sarge!

741
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,270
Those are orders.

742
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,304
I ain't Army, though, Sarge, I'm Navy...

743
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:43,018
...and I joined up for the duration,
which ain't yet.

744
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:46,019
Besides, I still gotta get me
a couple of Japs.

745
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,216
The rest of us had better stay here.

746
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,055
Hey, kid...

747
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,226
...when you get around to fixin'...

748
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,170
It's R-a-m-i...

749
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,264
Yeah, I know.

750
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,057
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

751
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:26,285
Hey, look...

752
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,060
Well, never mind.

753
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,165
I offered a suggestion, Sergeant.

754
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:45,247
I'd hate to have to use my rank
to make it an order.

755
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,082
I'd hate to have you do that, Lieutenant.

756
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:55,087
You might get to Corregidor,
you might not.

757
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:59,160
Meanwhile, nobody's told me it's time
to let those Japs move through this pass.

758
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,164
- How much longer can you hold on?
- I don't know.

759
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,059
Maybe I oughta call the whole thing off.
Maybe I've done everything wrong.

760
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,105
Maybe this, maybe that...

761
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:14,037
...but I'm playin' the hand the cards dealt.

762
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:15,236
The patrol stays here.

763
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,039
Sooner or later they have gotta come out
in the open where we can see 'em.

764
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,276
We're gonna be here when they do.

765
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,183
I don't want to pull out of here either...

766
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,026
...but I guess that's the right thing to do.

767
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,121
For you, yeah.

768
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,260
But as I understood it at the beginning,
the patrol's my job, the plane's yours.

769
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,230
That still go?

770
01:10:47,143 --> 01:10:48,269
Still goes, Sergeant.

771
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,235
Hey, Sarge?

772
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,120
What? You think you got a first mortgage
on this war or somethin'?

773
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:08,289
Well, I own a piece of it.

774
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:11,192
Maybe you can stop us
from goin' by plane.

775
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,292
Just what do you do if
we start walkin'?

776
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,028
The Japs would do it same as
to Salazar and Katigbak.

777
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:20,039
Me, I'm gonna die all in one piece...

778
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,166
...if and when.

779
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:25,110
Well, maybe the Japs don't worry us
as much as they do you.

780
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,048
Walk if you want to, only...

781
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:30,175
...it says in the book
I tell you when and where to stop.

782
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,085
It also says that if you keep on going,
I let you have it.

783
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,148
Deserting in the face of the enemy.

784
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:39,025
You'll have to shoot awful fast
to stop five guys.

785
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,187
There won't be five!

786
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:45,122
You're not goin' anyplace, except with me.
When you and I leave, we leave together.

787
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,192
- Now, look...
- Get back on your gun!

788
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,247
You...

789
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:11,142
I wish there was more moon tonight.
We need the extra light down in the grove.

790
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,313
- Is five minutes enough?
- Yeah, that'll do it.

791
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:17,019
Start firing at 11:00 on the nose.
Make all the noise you can.

792
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,254
- Better issue me a couple grenades.
- Okay.

793
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:25,194
- It was nice meeting you, Lieutenant.
- It was nice knowing you too, Sailor.

794
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,064
Well, thanks.

795
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,128
You too. I'll see you some more.

796
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,302
We'll be countin' on that.

797
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,270
Here you are, Sarge.

798
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,304
So long, Lieutenant.

799
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,107
So long, Jake.

800
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:42,275
Let's go, Hardy.

801
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:50,053
Come on, kid.

802
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:58,197
Lay on the bridge.

803
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,125
Come on, kid.

804
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,197
I'm sorry.

805
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:10,041
Get in there. Here.

806
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:13,310
And don't fire until I give
the order, please.

807
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,195
All set?

808
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,028
They're working down there. Hear 'em?

809
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,292
Busy little beavers, ain't they?

810
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,332
Well, let them have their fun.

811
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,104
In four minutes and 20 seconds...

812
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,079
...we'll break up their party.

813
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,114
It'll be a pleasure, Corporal.

814
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,051
Let's go, Soldier.

815
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,118
Cease firing!

816
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,296
What's the matter with him?
Why don't he take off?

817
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:40,078
Get in there!

818
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:41,156
Stay put!

819
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,079
All of you!

820
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,229
- What happened?
- They got the Lieutenant.

821
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,231
He wouldn't let me move him.
He'd fall apart.

822
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:52,062
Get some dynamite.

823
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,226
- For what?
- Go on, get it.

824
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,067
Purckett, take care of him.

825
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,072
- Where's he hit?
- Just fever.

826
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,176
Todd, you're in charge until we get back.
Stand ready to fire at will.

827
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:13,188
- What goes on, Sarge?
- Lieutenant's orders. Come on.

828
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:26,256
Cover us.

829
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,101
Lieutenant, I can't let you do this.

830
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,036
Got to get this ship in the air...

831
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,140
...let 'em have it.

832
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,276
But you may never even get her
off the ground.

833
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,084
Got lots to do...

834
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,320
...and not much time left.

835
01:18:58,133 --> 01:18:59,293
Plane's my job, Sarge.

836
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,125
Remember?

837
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,130
Okay, Lieutenant.

838
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:07,075
Okay.

839
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:47,214
I wish the Sarge'd get back.
They're working on that bridge again.

840
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,275
Shouldn't we open up on 'em?
Sergeant said, ''Fire at will.''

841
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,250
I want to hit me a Jap and know
I hit him. That's what I want.

842
01:19:57,326 --> 01:20:00,022
- Look, Corporal...
- Shut up, will you?

843
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:03,155
- Wait a minute, I got a right to ask...
- I said, shut up.

844
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:40,200
Hey, look at it. Look at it!

845
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:44,033
Come on, get her off the ground!
Get her up in the air!

846
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,081
He's off! Look!

847
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,301
I should have been in that plane.

848
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,271
I should have been in that plane!

849
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,051
Hey, come back here. Come here!

850
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,054
Come here!

851
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,056
He don't know what he's doing.

852
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,081
He's a sick man. He's delirious.

853
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:14,193
You can't help him anyway now.
He wouldn't even want you to try.

854
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,264
Don't you know any other songs?

855
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:26,131
Sure, but I'm partial to
the St. Louis blues.

856
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,192
Same as me.

857
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:30,204
All right, that's deep enough.

858
01:23:30,272 --> 01:23:31,330
Relax, Sailor.

859
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,207
Here, I got one.

860
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:47,077
Tobacco kind of takes the edge off
when a man's hungry, don't it, Corporal?

861
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:52,116
You can promise your mind, but you gotta
deliver somethin' to your stomach...

862
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,252
...even if it's only tobacco smoke.

863
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,191
All right, we'll put one gun here
and one over there.

864
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,324
Sight 'em in for interlocking fire
across the front.

865
01:23:59,468 --> 01:24:00,629
Okay, Sarge.

866
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,095
You figure they'll come at us today, Sarge?

867
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:06,164
Well, if I was running their show
I'd figure now's the time.

868
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:10,167
The way they operate,
they put off usin' cold iron till last.

869
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,042
They try everything else first.

870
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,071
They've tried everything else.

871
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:19,145
Seems like they done give up
on that bridge-buildin', don't it?

872
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:22,247
Well, maybe. That don't mean
they won't take care of us.

873
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:24,319
No, we held 'em up too long.

874
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:28,296
It kind of sounds like this is it.

875
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,088
This is it, kid.

876
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,223
You've been askin' to see a Jap.

877
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:37,260
You're probably gonna see a whole mess
of them before you're a day older.

878
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,200
Come on, we'll move these guns.
Get goin'.

879
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:55,189
Yeah?

880
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,091
I might make a deal with you.

881
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,162
You doin' me favors, Sarge?

882
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,157
I did a favor for this Danny Burns once.

883
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,259
Yeah, so you say.

884
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,038
I've been thinkin'...

885
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,211
...if you keep your nose clean...

886
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,078
...if, as in when we get out of here...

887
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:24,275
...I might have a loss of memory.

888
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,156
Don't forget a thing, Sarge.

889
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,282
I never do.

890
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,262
Todd.

891
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:09,263
Let go of me!

892
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:10,264
Sarge!

893
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:13,097
Hey, Sarge! Sarge!

894
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:18,070
The trees are movin'! The bushes!
They're walkin'!

895
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:30,012
Everybody down.

896
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,177
Hold it, Sailor.

897
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:34,145
Fix bayonets.

898
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,301
Don't anybody move.

899
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:58,304
Don't make any noise.

900
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:01,240
They can't see us.

901
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:06,153
They don't know who's here
or how many, not for sure.

902
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:13,217
Have Japs got whites in their eyes?

903
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,028
We'll find out any minute now, Sailor.

904
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,023
Hold it.

905
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:49,218
Hold it.

906
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:54,123
Hold it.

907
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:00,034
Hold it.

908
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,245
All right...

909
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:16,148
...on the count.

910
01:28:20,095 --> 01:28:21,062
One...

911
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:24,187
...two...

912
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,034
Okay!

913
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:54,243
Jake.

914
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:10,066
It's that bunion.

915
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:13,102
It's murderin' me.

916
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:48,257
Pull it up.

917
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,293
Hold that.

918
01:38:03,077 --> 01:38:05,204
Hey, Sarge. Could I write a letter?

919
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:07,179
Yeah.

920
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:10,047
How are you gonna mail it, kid?
Carrier pigeon?

921
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:38,302
Hey, Todd.

922
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:40,035
Yeah?

923
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:43,249
Tell the Sailor to dictate it
and you'll write it.

924
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:45,308
I didn't join up for a nursemaid.

925
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:50,155
He's a good kid. He needs to get
pulled together for what's comin'.

926
01:38:51,192 --> 01:38:54,184
Help him with that letter.
Don't make it tough for him.

927
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:57,061
I never make it tough for anybody, Sarge.

928
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:15,180
Here. I'll give you a
hand with that, Sailor.

929
01:39:15,249 --> 01:39:16,216
Thanks.

930
01:39:18,152 --> 01:39:19,278
Gee, thanks, Corporal.

931
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,309
Who to?

932
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,120
''Dear Mum.'' M-u-m.

933
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,185
I call my mother Mum.

934
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,195
That's new and different.

935
01:39:32,032 --> 01:39:33,021
''Dear Mum.

936
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:37,137
''This letter may never reach you...

937
01:39:38,038 --> 01:39:40,131
''...but I want to write it while I can.

938
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:47,080
''There were 13 of us
when we got to where we are...

939
01:39:47,248 --> 01:39:50,081
''...and now there's only three of us left.

940
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:52,051
''There's the Sergeant...

941
01:39:52,253 --> 01:39:55,154
''...and Corporal Todd and myself.

942
01:39:57,191 --> 01:39:59,250
''Corporal Todd's writing this for me.

943
01:40:03,097 --> 01:40:05,088
''I happened to hurt my hand kind of.

944
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:14,037
''Maybe there won't be any of us
ever to get outta here alive.''

945
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:41,158
Rub that out.

946
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:54,080
''It's too bad some of the other men
I came here with had to get killed.

947
01:40:56,317 --> 01:40:59,286
''Maybe it don't seem to do
an awful lot of good...

948
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:04,079
''...a few men gettin' killed holding on
to some place you never heard of...

949
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:07,287
''...probably never will...

950
01:41:10,164 --> 01:41:11,188
''...but we figure...''

951
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:13,200
Wait a minute. Give me a chance.

952
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:21,233
''But we figure the men who died here...

953
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:25,271
''...may have done more
than we'll ever know...

954
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:28,181
''...to save this whole world.

955
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:33,150
''It's like Corporal Juan Katigbak said...''

956
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:35,280
- Did you hear him when he told me?
- Yeah.

957
01:41:37,191 --> 01:41:40,092
''He said, 'It don't matter
where a man dies...

958
01:41:40,327 --> 01:41:43,091
'''... as long as he dies for freedom.'''

959
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,188
Okay so far?

960
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,260
Sure, Sarge, sure.

961
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:52,264
''The rest of us are gonna get outta here.''

962
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:55,172
That's right, Sailor.

963
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:58,235
''And I'll be home before you know it...

964
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:01,105
''...so don't you worry none about me.

965
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:04,049
''Say hello to my girl...''

966
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,176
What's her name?

967
01:42:06,086 --> 01:42:07,053
Marie.

968
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:10,017
Make that, ''Give my love to Marie.''

969
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:14,089
Anything else?

970
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,288
No, Sarge, that's all.

971
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,154
Oh, just...

972
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:20,300
''Thanks for being my family.
Your loving son, Len.''

973
01:42:22,102 --> 01:42:24,229
My name's Leonard, but she calls me Len.

974
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,010
- You got an envelope?
- No.

975
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,044
I'll mail it when I get to Corregidor.

976
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:38,116
Yeah. That all?

977
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,088
Yeah. Get back on No. 3.

978
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:47,185
Hey, Sarge, do you mind
if I turn on the radio?

979
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:49,127
Yeah, it might be a good idea.

980
01:43:08,315 --> 01:43:10,283
Wish I'd brung a slot machine.

981
01:43:11,085 --> 01:43:12,279
Boy, they shower down gum.

982
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:20,249
If Ramirez was still here, I bet he'd be
trying for Tommy Dorsey from Hollywood.

983
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,125
Be kind of cheerful, huh?

984
01:43:25,132 --> 01:43:26,190
I'm getting something.

985
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:28,097
- Americans!
- Don't know what.

986
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:30,262
Filipinos! You are beayen.

987
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,038
This is Japan's lasy warning yo you all.

988
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:38,275
Lay down your arms.
Surrender now, at once.

989
01:43:39,113 --> 01:43:41,240
You will be yreayed kindly, wiyh chivalry...

990
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:45,142
...according yo yhe rules
of Japanese bushido.

991
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:47,312
Bushido! Bushwah! You stink!

992
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:35,067
It's you and me now, Sarge.

993
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:39,231
We've been heading for that
for a long time.

994
01:44:44,211 --> 01:44:47,112
The Sailor was standing
right behind that tree.

995
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:51,308
Sniper couldn't have got him. Couldn't
have even seen him from over there.

996
01:44:54,088 --> 01:44:57,057
One of those monkeys is still alive,
playin' possum.

997
01:44:57,091 --> 01:44:58,217
Maybe more than one.

998
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:01,024
The question is which?

999
01:45:03,197 --> 01:45:05,062
One way of findin' out.

1000
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:08,227
Spray the batch of them.

1001
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:11,237
You got somethin' there.
Come on, let's take a look.

1002
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:42,155
Don't do me any favors, Sarge.

1003
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:53,197
I guess this just ain't
your day, huh, Sarge?

1004
01:47:57,037 --> 01:48:00,097
You could have swindled yourself
a nice, shiny medal...

1005
01:48:02,109 --> 01:48:05,044
...takin' me back and stuck a rope
around my neck.

1006
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:13,211
I never figured I'd bump into you again.

1007
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,280
I told you I'd have a loss of memory.

1008
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,250
Far as I'm concerned, your name is Todd.

1009
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,284
It's Burns.

1010
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,024
Dan Burns.

1011
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:28,063
Danny Burns...

1012
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:31,170
...Corporal, 31st Infantry,
killed in action.

1013
01:48:42,082 --> 01:48:43,174
You know, Sarge...

1014
01:48:44,217 --> 01:48:47,084
...I began to have a little respect for you.

1015
01:48:53,193 --> 01:48:57,289
For a second back there, I thought it was
you that stuck that chiv in my back...

1016
01:49:01,068 --> 01:49:02,296
...and... and not the Jap.

1017
01:52:56,236 --> 01:52:58,295
Come on. Come on and get it!

1018
01:53:18,191 --> 01:53:20,159
Come on! Come and get it!

1019
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:28,133
Come on, suckers!
What's the matter with you?

1020
01:53:28,335 --> 01:53:30,269
What are you waitin' for?

1021
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:34,231
Didn't think we were here, did you?
You dirty rotten rats!

1022
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:38,243
We're still here! We'll always be here!
Why don't you come and get it?
