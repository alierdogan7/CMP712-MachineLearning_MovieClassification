1
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,318
l still have dreams...

2
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,446
...and certain things come back.

3
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,007
l don´t know what age l am,
but life is quite normal.

4
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,480
Whatever we´re doing
is an everyday happening.

5
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,840
And this is when l wake up.

6
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,046
And as old as l am, l´m still sobbing.

7
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,009
ln 1933, few of the Jewish families...

8
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,639
...who lived in Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia foresaw how much...

9
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,442
...their lives were about to change.

10
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,478
None of their children realized...

11
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,678
...how soon their childhood
was about to end.

12
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,098
l was a very happy little girl growing up.

13
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,290
My father absoIuteIy adored me.

14
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,778
There was never anything...

15
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:14,970
...that I couId have possibIy done wrong.

16
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:18,083
My father used to go out with me...

17
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:19,408
...shopping.

18
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,970
And l always used to admire this one suit...

19
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,731
...which was for ladies.

20
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,605
I was onIy a kid, you know.

21
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,801
And I aIways said,
"´Daddy, I wouId Iove to wear that suit."´

22
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:33,202
So, one day, he said,
"´ShaII we go in there?"´

23
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,853
And I said, "´That´s for big Iadies, I can´t....

24
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,812
"´Let´s go in there."´ And he went in there
and they took my measurements...

25
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,963
...and that suit was made for me.

26
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:45,728
And l came home,
and my mother was devastated.

27
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,132
"´What are you buying this IittIe girI
aII this stuff for?

28
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:50,566
"´She doesn´t need that."´

29
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,326
And my father said,
"´She is my pride and joy...

30
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,973
"´...and she needs everything
I can get for her."´

31
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,168
My parents were
sort of middle-class people.

32
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:18,528
My father was
a middle-level bank manager.

33
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:21,002
My mother was a lady of leisure.

34
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,008
And I was a very-much-desired first chiId.

35
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,169
They were both around 30 or so.

36
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:32,765
We had one of these very nice apartments
in Vienna, with a high ceiling...

37
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:36,045
...lots of light, as l remember it,
and big windows...

38
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,931
...and I guess I was spoiIed.

39
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,925
In addition to them,
there was the inevitabIe maid...

40
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,488
...nursemaid in the house in those days.

41
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:46,292
My grandmother Iooked in often
and Iived nearby.

42
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,967
lt was, in many ways, a rather idyllic life.

43
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,883
And I was indeed
the center of the universe.

44
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:12,925
There was my mother, father...

45
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:15,891
...and my sister,
who was four years younger than me.

46
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:18,931
We had a very happy, carefree childhood.

47
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:22,527
My father was aIways busy
during the week...

48
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:25,764
...but when he was home,
he often took me for waIks.

49
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:30,002
By the river mostly.
And we talked about everything.

50
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,684
That brought us probabIy cIoser.

51
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:40,522
l always felt that my father and l
were protecting my mother and sister.

52
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,167
I don´t know
what we were protecting them from.

53
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,482
I was about 8 years oId...

54
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:56,882
...when HitIer came to power.

55
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,483
l had got some school friends...

56
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,849
...and my mother tried to make
a birthday party for us.

57
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:13,612
The tabIe was set.

58
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,524
I was very excited.

59
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:18,002
Nobody came.

60
00:05:18,413 --> 00:05:21,485
Not a singIe chiId
came to this birthday party.

61
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,366
That was the first...

62
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:28,651
...terribIe bIow to me.

63
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,530
I know it sounds triviaI...

64
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:33,571
...but it was the first
sort of comprehension for a chiId...

65
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:35,928
...to understand that you´re ostracized.

66
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,243
That there´s something different about you.

67
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:47,966
For Jewish children...

68
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:51,648
...life under Hitler became increasingly
isolated and threatening.

69
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:55,887
While the Nazis stripped their parents
of their jobs and citizenship...

70
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,692
...the children were gradually barred
from schools...

71
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:01,651
...parks, theaters, and swimming pools.

72
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:09,290
l was overprotected because of...

73
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,722
...the Hitler dangers outside the home.

74
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:15,083
But very much loved in the home.

75
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:18,691
My mother sitting on my father
for a cuddIe...

76
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:20,684
...was an everyday occurrence.

77
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,333
I had to join in,
or eIse I wouId have been jeaIous.

78
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,643
He had to have both of us on his Iap.

79
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,442
My father used to say:

80
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:33,004
´´l´m too old to start again. ´´

81
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,490
Although he spoke perfect English...

82
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:39,851
...he felt he was just not young enough
to start in a new country.

83
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:44,053
And the other sentence,
which was because...

84
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:47,730
...his father and grandfather, and so on...

85
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,924
...were born in Germany was:

86
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:52,329
"´This has got to change.

87
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,211
"´This madman, HitIer, can´t possibIy Iast."´

88
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:06,410
l feared every day.

89
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:11,850
I was most unhappy going to schooI.

90
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,968
l was walking down the street...

91
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:20,206
...six or seven boys came,
called me ´´Jew bastard´´...

92
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:24,810
...and then attacked me and threw me
through a plate-glass window.

93
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,892
I was cut severeIy...

94
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:31,726
...and I had to go
to the hospitaI for stitches.

95
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,722
I didn´t want to go
to the schooI there anymore.

96
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:40,044
I just feIt that I was threatened constantIy.

97
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,808
As Hitler strengthened his control...

98
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:48,169
...he began looking for opportunities
to extend Germany´s power...

99
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,811
...beyond its borders.

100
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,291
ln March, 1938...

101
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,564
...German troops entered Austria...

102
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,803
...and without firing a single shot...

103
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,248
...annexed the country to the Reich.

104
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,806
The first thing that happens
when a disaster strikes...

105
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:06,451
...is that nothing changes.

106
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:09,526
You think there´s going to be
some great drama...

107
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:12,002
...and you go to put your nightgown on...

108
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:15,085
...and you say the Shema to your mother
and then you go to bed.

109
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:17,733
And you think, "´Oh, this isn´t so terribIe."´

110
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,762
But the next morning, my parents
took me downstairs into the street.

111
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,607
The streets were full of new uniforms
l´d never seen.

112
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:39,485
And the young people wore the red bands
around their arms with the swastika.

113
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,445
l didn´t know what that meant.

114
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,889
And they were stretching out their arms
in the Hitler salute.

115
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:51,890
And there were flags everywhere,
these new red flags...

116
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:55,364
...with the white circle
and the black swastika.

117
00:08:58,853 --> 00:09:01,606
My main sense
of something being wrong...

118
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:05,686
...was the haste with which my parents
got me back into the house.

119
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,771
Suddenly l couldn´t go
to my normal school anymore.

120
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:19,731
l was sent off to a makeshift school...

121
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,724
...at the end of the tramline.

122
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:25,323
And I did it aIone, even at age 7.

123
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:29,850
I went to the end of the Iine, and I wouId
just waIk on untiI I came to this house.

124
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:35,604
Word got back to my parents that while
on the tram, l was a very talkative boy.

125
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:39,242
l told them all the bad things
that Herr Hitler was doing.

126
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,485
I thought that "´Herr"´ was his first name,
of course.

127
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,641
And word got back to my parents
that maybe...

128
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,803
...I shouIdn´t be traveIing aIone.

129
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,169
And my father then came with me.

130
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,525
He didn´t say much, he hardIy ever did...

131
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,723
...but he Iet it be known...

132
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:00,408
...that it wasn´t wise to go around
saying bad things about HitIer.

133
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,811
ln the weeks following
the annexation of Austria...

134
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,965
...Nazi authorities had enacted
all the anti-Jewish laws...

135
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:15,602
...it had taken Hitler five years
to put into place in Germany.

136
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,445
For anyone coming from Vienna,
it was very dramatic.

137
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:28,043
The reality of it struck me
when my parents talked about...

138
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,046
...giving up the apartment,
that we had to Ieave.

139
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,730
That was something,
you know, the bottom faIIs out.

140
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,844
Everything faIIs out of you.

141
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:39,492
This is all l knew...

142
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,007
...and we had to give it up,
we had to leave.

143
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:44,766
That was probably the biggest blow l had.

144
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,852
Just the idea...

145
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,685
...it´II aII end the way it is.

146
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:00,249
My mother was an activist.

147
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:02,884
She knew something had to be done.

148
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:04,691
The decision was to go...

149
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,049
...to England to be hired...

150
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:10,210
...as a domestic, because the English
would take young women...

151
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,807
...who would not interfere
with the labor market.

152
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:15,248
The pIan was:
She wouId go ahead. She´d try...

153
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,289
...to get me and my father out.

154
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:20,441
This is the time when l remember...

155
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,884
...there was no conversation
among the grown-ups...

156
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:26,773
...except how to get out of Vienna.

157
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:31,247
It´s interesting because we´re now asked,
"´How come you didn´t Ieave?"´

158
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,928
And when I think
of what it meant to Ieave...

159
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:37,733
...how impossibIe it was to Ieave.

160
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,330
First of all, you had to have a sponsor...

161
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,410
...in the country you were going to.

162
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,963
Someone who would promise you would
not become a burden on the government.

163
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:51,329
You would have to get a visa
from the state department...

164
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,643
...or the government to be allowed in.

165
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,924
Then you had to get an exit permit
from the Nazis.

166
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,403
All these things had to come together.

167
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:03,406
And they had a time span
in which they would expire.

168
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:07,725
You had to collect all these things together
so that they would be ready.

169
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,570
And it usually didn´t happen.

170
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,126
The hardest thing
was to find a country to go to.

171
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:16,684
The countries under discussion were:

172
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,685
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela...

173
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,083
...Shanghai, Cuba, the Dominican Republic.

174
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:27,050
l remember going with my father
to the American consulate.

175
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,972
There was a queue around the block...

176
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,932
...up the stairs...

177
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,371
...and around the room.

178
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,848
We are now in the late summer of 1938.

179
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:46,683
I got to the United States on May 1, 1951 .

180
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,602
It was a 13-year...

181
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,006
...quota for us.

182
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,887
German troops
had barely entered Austria...

183
00:12:57,053 --> 00:13:01,046
...when Hitler demanded the annexation
of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.

184
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:03,531
He insisted that the province...

185
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:06,685
...which was home
to over three million ethnic Germans ...

186
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:09,287
...be allowed to secede and join the Reich.

187
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:13,964
On October 1,
with international agreement...

188
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,847
...German troops
marched into Sudetenland...

189
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,846
...adding one-fifth of Czechoslovakia
to the Reich...

190
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,403
...and opening the way
for further dismemberment of the country.

191
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,367
From then on, people were wondering...

192
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,125
...what would happen next.

193
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,209
Father was an optimist because...

194
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:36,808
...he did business with people in France
who wrote and said:

195
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,203
´´lt´s going to be bad, get out. ´´

196
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,884
But for Father, no,
things Iike that wouIdn´t happen.

197
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,613
He had a greater faith in mankind.

198
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:50,326
He used to say that he wouId rather
trust peopIe and be disappointed...

199
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,927
...than go through Iife
not trusting anybody.

200
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,410
Less than half a year later...

201
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:01,042
...Hitler would destroy the Czech state.

202
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:04,883
But now, the Nazis continued
their persecution of the Jews.

203
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,171
ln November,
they orchestrated a vicious pogrom...

204
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,922
...which they later called KristaIInacht:

205
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:13,204
´´The Night of Broken Glass. ´´

206
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,767
l had had a strange dream in the night...

207
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:24,362
...that my father was being arrested.

208
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,924
Our evening meaI that evening...

209
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:31,562
...was the Iast meaI
I ever remember having with my father.

210
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:32,848
I Iooked at him...

211
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,401
...and l thought, well, l hadn´t really...

212
00:14:35,853 --> 00:14:37,764
...seen his features properly.

213
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,732
You know
how you Iook at somebody intenseIy?

214
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:43,091
And something toId me...

215
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,768
...that I must imprint
that image of him in my mind.

216
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,086
Before l went to bed...

217
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:56,210
...my father, in a rather stern voice,
said to me:

218
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:59,091
"´If you hear any strange noises
during the night...

219
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:01,243
"´...immediateIy get out of bed...

220
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,365
´´...and go into that wardrobe
in the hallway. ´´

221
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,569
And l said, ´´l don´t understand. ´´

222
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:09,167
And quite differently than my father...

223
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:12,811
...wouId normaIIy answer my questions,
he said:

224
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,891
"´Don´t ask any questions,
just do as you´re toId."´

225
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,967
l was woken up at 2:00 a.m.

226
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,050
Terrible banging on the door.

227
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,166
There were two...

228
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,164
...Nazis at the door...

229
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:32,405
...shouting, "´You´re aII under arrest!
Put some cIothes on and come with us! "´

230
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,723
l remember that it was a very cold...

231
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,168
...very dark night. We all went off...

232
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:46,089
...to an assembly point,
which was like a big square.

233
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,446
And there were just...

234
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,611
...thousands of other Jews.

235
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,446
And l mean thousands.

236
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:57,407
And there were people l knew
and people l didn´t know.

237
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:59,324
And people getting beaten up.

238
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:01,406
And people crying.

239
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:05,489
l think everybody was petrified.

240
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:10,612
I aIso remember very vividIy
that they were beating up the rabbi.

241
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:14,771
And they had fetched the Torahs
out of the synagogue.

242
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,448
And I think they were trampIing on them.

243
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:32,090
l took my bicycle
and went to school as always.

244
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,207
There was no Jewish business
that l passed...

245
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,922
...that wasn´t broken into.

246
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,882
The merchandise was either on the street...

247
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:44,645
...or looted completely.

248
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,244
As I got cIoser to schooI...

249
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,409
...I saw huge piIIars of smoke...

250
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:54,925
...coming from the sections...

251
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,811
...where the two big synagogues
in Frankfurt were.

252
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,322
And l saw that they were on fire.

253
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:08,490
Our schooI happened to be just opposite
on the street where the synagogue was.

254
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,722
l was dragged out
with the stream of children.

255
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,088
Everybody went to the playground...

256
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:17,085
...to watch these flames.

257
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,249
And suddenly somebody said:

258
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:26,285
"´There´s a Jew!
Let´s throw her on the fire as weII! "´

259
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:31,841
l don´t know how l got home.
l still don´t know today how l got home.

260
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:35,691
And when I got home
my mother was absoIuteIy shocked.

261
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:37,650
My father had been arrested.

262
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,931
My father was quite an outspoken person.

263
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,771
When they came to Buchenwald...

264
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:51,323
...and they took away
all the men´s braces and shoelaces...

265
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:55,407
...he protested and said,
´´You can´t treat these old people like this. ´´

266
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:58,963
So they made an exampIe of him.
They beat him to death...

267
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:01,044
...in front of everybody...

268
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:04,921
...in order to instiII terror and obedience.

269
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:12,491
They offered us my father´s ashes
in return for money...

270
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,723
...and eventually the urn came.

271
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,967
And we buried it in the Jewish cemetery.

272
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:20,653
Of course, whether it was his ashes,
one never knows.

273
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:25,811
We heard loud banging
on the door downstairs...

274
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:28,727
...and so my aunt, my mother and l...

275
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,525
...ran up into the attic.

276
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:34,288
We were hiding
in an old wardrobe up there.

277
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:39,811
And I do remember feeIing
as though I had spent my entire Iife...

278
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,326
...in that wardrobe.

279
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:44,206
And I aIso remember
whispering to my mother:

280
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:48,890
"´I want to get out of here,
and not just out of this wardrobe...

281
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,083
"´...I want to get out of Germany."´

282
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,251
World revulsion was swift.

283
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:10,606
Yet Britain was the only country
willing to relax its immigration controls.

284
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:14,806
But only for children who would not
threaten British jobs or public funds.

285
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,730
Days after the Nazi pogrom...

286
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:21,569
...Anglo-Jewish leaders
met with Prime Minister Chamberlain ...

287
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:24,850
...and urged him to let into the country
unaccompanied children...

288
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,810
...Christian as well as Jewish...

289
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,724
...up to the age of 1 7.

290
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:32,362
Six days later,
Quakers joined Jewish leaders...

291
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:35,126
...to present the government
a concrete rescue plan...

292
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:38,205
...to be funded by refugee
and religious organizations.

293
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:41,732
That night, the House of Commons
debated the issue...

294
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,485
...and approved the plan.

295
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,372
My youth leader said:

296
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,886
´´Call Otto Hirsch.

297
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,248
´´There is a job for you to be done. ´´

298
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,052
So l went and saw him, and he said:

299
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,124
"´I have a request.

300
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:59,811
"´We have been informed...

301
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,405
"´...that the British government,
the House of Commons...

302
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:06,930
"´...had discussed the destiny
of Jews in Germany after...

303
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,526
"´...aII this pubIicity...

304
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,331
"´...and they are disgusted."´

305
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,443
´´They came to the conclusion...

306
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,127
´´...to accept children for a certain time.

307
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,568
´´We have an office for the operations.

308
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,132
"´See what you can do."´

309
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:28,445
As the transports got underway
in Germany and Austria...

310
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:32,527
...thousands of Sudetenland refugees
continued to flee to Prague.

311
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,488
English stockbroker Nicholas Winton...

312
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:39,963
...was summoned by a friend
to view the situation for himself.

313
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,052
He toured refugee camps
with Doreen Warriner...

314
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:47,571
...a representative of the British Committee
for Refugees from Czechoslovakia.

315
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:54,848
We did have the feeIing
that the position was much more urgent...

316
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,686
...than anybody in London thought.

317
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:09,692
Doreen Warriner said, ´´l don´t know
what we will do about the children. ´´

318
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:14,002
Almost spontaneously l said,
´´Well, when l get back to England...

319
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:17,483
´´...l find that the Home Office
will allow them in...

320
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:20,532
´´...we´ll try and get some of them
into England. ´´

321
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,086
And when l went to the Home Office,
they said:

322
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:29,206
´´Under certain conditions, you can bring in
as many children as you like. ´´

323
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:31,806
We had to produce...

324
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:36,250
...somebody who´d guarantee 50
against their re-immigration...

325
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:40,128
...which is about 1,000 today.
It was quite a Iot of money.

326
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:43,683
And then I had to find a famiIy
who´d take each individuaI chiId.

327
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:48,451
lt certainly wasn´t easy,
but it wasn´t that difficult.

328
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:53,243
lt´s easier to get somebody
to take a child than to take a grown-up.

329
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,969
l tried to get America involved...

330
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:59,882
...and wrote to a lot of the senators...

331
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:03,807
...and got a Iot of answers
saying how concerned they were...

332
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,851
...and aII the reasons
why they couIdn´t do anything.

333
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,971
ln the United States...

334
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:13,563
...a congressional bill
to admit 20,000 child refugees...

335
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,412
...died in committee.

336
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:17,889
One of the arguments against the bill...

337
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:20,806
...was that accepting children
without their parents...

338
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:23,532
...was contrary to the laws of God.

339
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,372
My father said:

340
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:44,971
´´Mommy and l cannot leave,
but you´re going to leave. ´´

341
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:47,283
I said, "´What do you mean,
I´m going to Ieave?"´

342
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,443
"´You´re going to EngIand,"´ he said.

343
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:51,082
"´When?"´

344
00:22:51,493 --> 00:22:52,687
"´Thursday,"´ he said.

345
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:53,762
I knew...

346
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,450
...that she ought to go...

347
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,845
...that I ought to send her away...

348
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:03,005
...but I couIdn´t imagine
giving permission for her to go.

349
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:05,004
My husband said, "´She must go."´

350
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,411
He didn´t Iisten to me.

351
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:11,083
He just arranged everything for her.

352
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:14,967
And l had to give in, and l saw in the end...

353
00:23:15,173 --> 00:23:16,686
...that he was right.

354
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,170
But the hurt is unbeIievabIe.

355
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,365
That cannot be described.

356
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:45,288
My father died when l was 3 years old.

357
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:47,125
My mother had to go out to work...

358
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:49,408
...so l wound up in the orphanage.

359
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:55,249
When Polish Jews were arrested
all over Germany...

360
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,528
...I´d found out
that my mother was deported.

361
00:23:57,613 --> 00:24:00,252
I was on my own.
I had nobody, no one, nothing.

362
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,971
l went to the Gemeinde.

363
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,688
There was this wonderful woman
who knew me there.

364
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:08,048
She said,
"´Pascha, what are you doing here?

365
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:11,409
"´Where´s your mother?"´
I said, "´My mother´s been deported."´

366
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,889
And she said to me,
"´There´s something happening now.

367
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,685
´´l think you should get onto it. ´´
lt was the Kindertransport.

368
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:23,129
She said, "´You´d better register
immediateIy because you´re by yourseIf.

369
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,612
"´What wiII you do?"´

370
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,684
So I said, "´Okay. I´II go to EngIand."´

371
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,048
Just Iike matter of fact,
as if it was nothing.

372
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,561
ln hindsight...

373
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,650
...l think my sister and l...

374
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,849
...we owe it to my father´s death...

375
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:38,805
...that we have survived...

376
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:40,845
...because they seIected...

377
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:42,292
...chiIdren...

378
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:44,205
...who had probIems...

379
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:46,646
...who´d Iost parents...

380
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,691
...or whose parents
couId no Ionger Iook after them...

381
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,650
...to go on the Kindertransport.

382
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:56,332
Mother came home
and said that she´d enrolled us.

383
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,731
About a fortnight later...

384
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,322
...my parents were toId that I couId go.

385
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:04,771
A week or two after that...

386
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,487
...my parents decided my sister couId go.

387
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:10,123
Now both of us wouId go.

388
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,324
That must have been very hard.

389
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,610
That wouId have been hard to decide
that we wouId both go.

390
00:25:20,093 --> 00:25:22,482
We had about a fortnight before we left.

391
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:26,123
lnto that fortnight,
both Mother and Father...

392
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:30,168
...were trying to give their instructions
and guidance...

393
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,571
...that they hoped
to have their whole lives to give.

394
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:40,729
My bar mitzvah was
a month after ´´Crystal Night. ´´

395
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,851
lt was held in an attic.

396
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,969
My father was not there,
he was still in a concentration camp.

397
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,806
lt was just my mother.

398
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,367
l felt terrible.

399
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:56,924
There was no ceIebration afterwards.
There was nothing.

400
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,403
You read your part from the Torah, and...

401
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,132
...you did your haftorah
and you were finished.

402
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:07,562
And we were Iucky that a minyan...

403
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:10,765
...showed up aItogether.

404
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,172
l certainly felt...

405
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,728
...that the sooner we left Germany...

406
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,769
...the better off we would be.

407
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:24,008
My housemother wrote...

408
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,929
...to Baron James de Rothschild...

409
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:29,565
...asking if he would take...

410
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:32,042
...24 of her boys...

411
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:34,363
...her husband, herself...

412
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:36,325
...and her two daughters.

413
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,283
And he wrote back in January that...

414
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:41,242
...he wouId.

415
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:54,931
We thought of England...

416
00:26:55,053 --> 00:26:57,521
...as a land of lords and ladies because...

417
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:00,965
...of the King and Queen,
and the two little princesses...

418
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,762
...appealed to us very much.
We saw their pictures in the newspapers.

419
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:08,607
The coronation with their ermine clothes
and crowns on their heads.

420
00:27:08,813 --> 00:27:12,328
And we reaIIy thought that in EngIand
that´s how peopIe dressed.

421
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:15,132
Perhaps not every day,
but sometimes on Sundays.

422
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:18,086
So that was our expectation of EngIand.

423
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:24,452
I was toId this was the best thing
that couId happen, and I was so Iucky...

424
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:28,486
...because everybody around me
was trying to find pIaces...

425
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,651
...for their chiIdren.

426
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:33,123
And, suddenIy, out of the bIue...

427
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,488
...I had a chance to come to EngIand.

428
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,365
How lucky can l be?

429
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:46,532
My parents said
l´d be able to go back to school...

430
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,649
...l will learn another language...

431
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,965
...l will live in London,
l will be able to travel on the subway....

432
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:56,525
And painted a beautiful picture.

433
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:59,002
And added, again and again:

434
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:00,845
´´And we´ll follow soon. ´´

435
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,847
However, a few days or so...

436
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,089
...before I was to Ieave...

437
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:10,371
...I accused my parents
of trying to get rid of me.

438
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:14,731
l said to my parents,
´´l´m really a gypsy child...

439
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:17,925
´´...and now you´re trying to get rid of me.
You adopted me...

440
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:20,083
´´...and now you no longer want me. ´´

441
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:23,644
I must have reaIIy, deepIy,
deepIy hurt my parents.

442
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:31,731
Since German policy in 1938
was to force Jewish emigration...

443
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,847
...the Nazis willingly let
the children leave...

444
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:37,970
...as long as they did not take
any valuables with them.

445
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:40,968
Each child was allowed one suitcase...

446
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:42,765
...one piece of hand luggage...

447
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,366
...and ten reichsmark.

448
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:55,532
We had four days...

449
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:57,683
...to pack and go.

450
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:03,044
My parents were so busy getting ready
the things l was going to take...

451
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,889
...that l don´t think they nor l had time...

452
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:09,803
...to think about what was happening.

453
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,687
My mother prepared all our clothes.

454
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,407
She lovingly embroidered our names...

455
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:21,724
...on every piece of clothing,
even every handkerchief...

456
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:23,727
...every sock...

457
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,167
...everything.

458
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,683
l think l took my teddy bear.

459
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:29,967
My mother...

460
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:33,649
...always slept on a little pillow
on top of her big pillow...

461
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,852
...and l asked her
if l could take that with me.

462
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,686
She said, ´´Sure. ´´

463
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:44,487
Mother had new clothes made
for both of us.

464
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:48,330
We had a dressmaker at home
who did all the sewing.

465
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,364
And some clothes she bought.

466
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:52,331
Otherwise, around my neck...

467
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:55,246
...because we were baptized,
hoping that would be...

468
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,686
...of some help...

469
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,651
...I had a IittIe cross...

470
00:29:59,053 --> 00:30:00,964
...and I had a IittIe eIephant...

471
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:02,725
...and I had a sort of....

472
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,411
It wasn´t a Jewish star,
but it was a IittIe angeI.

473
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,729
I put them aII together because I thought
the AImighty couId choose...

474
00:30:11,813 --> 00:30:14,532
...which reIigion
he wouId Iike me to beIong to.

475
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:17,125
So sad the things I remember.

476
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:27,332
l remember that last evening,
when all the cousins and all the aunts...

477
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,165
...came to say good-bye.

478
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,813
There was one aunt who had twins.

479
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:34,926
She was extremely angry
with my parents...

480
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:39,212
...for getting me onto this transport,
and for not having managed to get...

481
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,324
...her twins onto the transport.

482
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:46,366
There was grief and panic
and fury in that room.

483
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:49,564
There was a moment...

484
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:51,928
...that my father took me
between his knees...

485
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:53,241
...and he said:

486
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,528
"´Now, when you get to EngIand...

487
00:30:55,893 --> 00:31:00,045
"´...you must taIk to aII the EngIish peopIe
you meet and you have to ask them...

488
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,967
"´...to get your mother and me out,
and your grandparents out."´

489
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,564
And because this aunt was there
and had been so unhappy...

490
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,442
...and so angry, he said,
"´And Aunt so-and-so´s twins."´

491
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,808
Before long, l had a list...

492
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:19,644
...of people whom l, at 10 years old,
had promised to save from Hitler.

493
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:25,883
The transports began in December...

494
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:28,687
...barely three weeks
after the Nazi pogrom.

495
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:32,562
Although a few children traveled by plane...

496
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:34,723
...the majority departed by train.

497
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,929
Some trains left during the day...

498
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:40,329
...many others in the dead of night.

499
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:48,764
Each child was given a number.

500
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,368
My number...

501
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:53,331
...and l still have it, was 152.

502
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:56,048
This was a number that every chiId...

503
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,846
...put around its neck...

504
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:01,164
...and a simiIar number
was attached to our suitcases.

505
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:06,444
There we stood, in our groups of fifty,
I think it was...

506
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,728
...and there was my mother and my father.

507
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:10,246
My mother kept up...

508
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:14,327
...a conversation with me
as if this was an ordinary and interesting...

509
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:17,041
...thing that was happening.

510
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:19,124
But I remember that she wore...

511
00:32:19,213 --> 00:32:21,932
...a pony fur with a fox coIIar...

512
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:24,208
...and her face was inside the fox coIIar.

513
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:25,806
l remember that although...

514
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:28,726
...her speech was
as if everything was ordinary...

515
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:31,282
...her face, l remember, was hot.

516
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:33,165
lt was red and hot.

517
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:41,008
Every parent promised their child:

518
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,403
´´We will soon come and follow. ´´

519
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:45,804
How otherwise did the parents...

520
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:48,487
...get the little children onto the trains.

521
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,409
"´Give us a few weeks, when things...

522
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:54,127
"´...wiII either bIow over
and you´II come back again...

523
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,805
"´...or we´II come join you."´

524
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:59,488
That was a promise
every parent made to their chiId.

525
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:07,128
There came the time to say to the parents:

526
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:09,204
"´You cannot go to the pIatform.

527
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:11,011
"´The poIice wiII not aIIow it.

528
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:12,890
"´You have to say good-bye here."´

529
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,203
So I ascended a chair there...

530
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,124
...and addressed the peopIe.

531
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:20,086
Where I got the courage to do that,
I don´t know.

532
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:23,562
But l told the parents:

533
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,122
´´This is your last good-bye. ´´

534
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:30,525
They didn´t want the German public
to know what was going on...

535
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:32,604
...because they had experiences...

536
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,524
...of parents weeping and...

537
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,770
...fainting at the platform.

538
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:38,684
So we had to say good-bye...

539
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,652
...groups had to say good-bye,
in an anteroom.

540
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,803
The scenes were pretty horrendous.

541
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:47,207
When my sister and brother left...

542
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:50,527
...all the other parents were crying bitterly.

543
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:54,005
I was so afraid.

544
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,124
I didn´t want my mother to cry...

545
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,602
...because she was a very strong person.

546
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,684
l thought, ´´lf she cries...

547
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,763
´´...terrible things will happen. ´´

548
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:09,612
I kept on Iooking at her, and I said,
"´Don´t cry. You won´t cry."´ And she didn´t.

549
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:16,887
l got to the station,
which was crowded with people.

550
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:20,769
All the children had parents with them...

551
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,287
...and I was sitting there aII by myseIf.

552
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:27,089
I had no parents. Nobody.
I was just there with a suitcase.

553
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,082
There was nobody´s shoulder
l could cry on.

554
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,209
All l knew was l was going away.

555
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:35,885
I was going to EngIand.

556
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,043
Whatever wouId happen wouId happen.

557
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:41,525
Every day my father said:

558
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:43,730
´´Pupela, l don´t want you to go.

559
00:34:43,813 --> 00:34:46,771
´´But l want you to go
because it´ll be good for you. ´´

560
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:49,969
The day came and we went.

561
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:53,405
My mother and dad
went with me inside the train...

562
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,571
...and put my suitcase up.

563
00:34:57,813 --> 00:35:00,122
My seat was right at the window.

564
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:02,681
The German trains
had great big windows...

565
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:05,128
...and my father pulled that
all the way down...

566
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:07,443
...so l could be leaning out of the window.

567
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:09,171
He hugged and kissed me.

568
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:12,764
I couId see my father´s face getting...

569
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:14,806
...whiter and whiter.

570
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,644
l thought, ´´l only hope nothing
is going to happen to him. ´´

571
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:22,203
He looked so terribly, terribly pale.

572
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,571
My poor mother
was getting worse and worse.

573
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:28,292
l couldn´t wait for the train to go because...

574
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,769
...l didn´t want to remember that.

575
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,688
The guy came...

576
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:36,525
...and he waved the signal.

577
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:38,285
When the train started to go...

578
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:41,251
...my father says, "´PupeIa!
Let me hoId your hands! "´

579
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,769
And I heId my hands and said,
"´I have to Iet go! I have to Iet go! "´

580
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,687
"´No! I don´t want you to go!
I don´t want you to go! "´

581
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,725
And we were aIready....
My father couIdn´t waIk very fast...

582
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:55,442
...because he waIked with a cane.
We went a IittIe bit more...

583
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,289
...and he took me by my hands...

584
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,648
...and he puIIed me out of the window.

585
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,087
And I feII.

586
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:05,323
I couId have faIIen in-between...

587
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,201
...the pIatform and the train.
There was onIy a smaII amount of space.

588
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:12,684
I didn´t, but I got hurt and I was bIeeding...

589
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,929
...and I was devastated.

590
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,565
AbsoIuteIy devastated.

591
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:22,689
And my father was in seventh heaven...

592
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:25,851
...that he had his IittIe PupeIa,
his IittIe girI, back.

593
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:32,451
The parting was terrible.

594
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,723
That´s the one thing l have never...

595
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,644
...forgotten in all my life.

596
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,363
And she had been so controlled.

597
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:42,251
She´d always been...

598
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:44,372
...a sort of solid...

599
00:36:44,973 --> 00:36:46,042
...support to us.

600
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,931
And suddenly she showed her feelings...

601
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:52,726
...and it was terrifying, really terrifying.

602
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:55,406
We saw this face...

603
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,924
...which showed aII the hurt...

604
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,648
...and agony she´d been through.

605
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:04,685
And l can still see my father that mealtime.

606
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:08,768
But l would have liked to have had
a happier image of my mother.

607
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:11,486
That´s the onIy image...

608
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:13,165
...of this contorted...

609
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:15,768
...face...

610
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,012
...fuII of agony.

611
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:19,812
It was very sad.

612
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:32,242
l remember standing by the window
and waving good-bye...

613
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:35,083
...and just trying hard to believe...

614
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:38,768
...that we really would come back.
That it won´t be for very long.

615
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:42,164
But when the train moved
and they disappeared from sight...

616
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,487
...both Vera and I
cried in each other´s arms.

617
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:54,650
My parents ran along the train...

618
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:56,132
...on the pIatform.

619
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:59,285
And I stiII remember, sort of in my head...

620
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:03,361
...I heard that refrain,
"´You´re Ieaving! You´re Ieaving! "´

621
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:07,885
I watched their faces.
Tears were streaming down their faces...

622
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:09,726
...down their cheeks.

623
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,644
And I knew then...

624
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:14,488
...these peopIe reaIIy Iove me.

625
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:16,763
This is why they´re sending me away.

626
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:21,572
l immediately started to write
to my parents.

627
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,885
And l apologized
for what l had said to them...

628
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,687
...that they were trying to get rid of me.

629
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,321
ln no time...

630
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:42,451
...the suitcase was gone.

631
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:45,851
The child was gone.
The other children were gone.

632
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:47,241
Just emptiness.

633
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,483
Then we turned around and went home.

634
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:53,921
I did not taIk.

635
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:57,807
It was awfuI.

636
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:08,083
The children went with the hope
that the parents would follow, or that...

637
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:11,370
...one day they could come back
and see them again.

638
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,366
l did not realize...

639
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,328
...and l could never have realized...

640
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:19,768
...that only a year and a half later...

641
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:22,683
...from the same raiIway station...

642
00:39:22,773 --> 00:39:25,367
...trains wouId go in the other direction...

643
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:27,125
...to HitIer´s sIaughterhouses.

644
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,044
l remember all that day we sang songs.

645
00:40:32,253 --> 00:40:34,972
We ate the things
that our mothers had given us.

646
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,969
When we got to the border...

647
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:41,848
...it got very frightening because...

648
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:44,891
...the train stopped at the last station...

649
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:46,372
...before Holland.

650
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,012
The big girIs were very frightened
and they scared us.

651
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,412
They said, "´Don´t move."´

652
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:55,168
You know what happens when you sit
and don´t move? You begin to trembIe...

653
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,928
...if you tense yourseIf enough.
I remember that...

654
00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:02,050
...I was sitting there so tense
that I was vibrating.

655
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:06,442
The Nazi border guard...

656
00:41:07,093 --> 00:41:09,129
...very officiously came around...

657
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,325
...and made some of the children
open their suitcases.

658
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,452
They shouted at us...

659
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,685
...and threw their weight about.

660
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,162
They were Iooking for
new things peopIe had.

661
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:22,848
ChiIdren had new cIothes and things.
They didn´t Iike that.

662
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,129
They gave the chiIdren a tough time.

663
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:28,884
Children kept crying and crying.

664
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:30,885
We were there quite a while.

665
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:34,204
They took their time
and enjoyed doing what they did to us.

666
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:59,643
Then suddenIy we were in HoIIand.

667
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:03,170
Everyone was cheering:

668
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:06,723
"´Those damn Nazis!
They shouId drop dead! Now we are free! "´

669
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:17,686
There was howling, yelling, shouting,
and singing.

670
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,003
lt was the best party l´ve ever been at...

671
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:23,290
...although l didn´t really understand
what was happening.

672
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:27,322
I was hoIding a big girI around the waist,
and she was hoIding me.

673
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:30,247
They knew the songs they were singing.

674
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:33,173
They were probabIy Zionist songs...

675
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:36,445
...but I sang aIong
because it was so much fun...

676
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,364
...to be part of this party.

677
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:44,642
Not only were the frontier guards
on the Dutch side very nice...

678
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:47,125
...they had a contingent...

679
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:49,563
...of ladies who brought us cocoa...

680
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:51,604
...and Dutch zwieback.

681
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:54,409
It was Iike manna from heaven.

682
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:55,846
It was wonderfuI.

683
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,569
You suddenIy feIt
as though you´d been cIad...

684
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:04,646
...in a cIoak of Iead or iron...

685
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:06,804
...and it had been taken from you.

686
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:09,612
It was a wonderfuI feeIing of freedom.

687
00:43:10,893 --> 00:43:12,451
We started to smile.

688
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:15,765
l don´t think any of them
had smiled for a long time.

689
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,612
lt was wonderful.

690
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:33,451
Then the train went on
to Hoek van Holland.

691
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:36,931
We got onto the boat...

692
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,725
...which took us to Harwich.

693
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:41,247
lt was an unpleasant trip because...

694
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,571
...the EngIish ChanneI...

695
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:47,411
...is one of the worst pIaces
in wintertime to cross.

696
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:51,566
We had small children
and people got seasick.

697
00:43:52,453 --> 00:43:54,250
lt was some how-do-you-do.

698
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:22,361
l have a very vivid memory of waking up...

699
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:26,842
...and seeing the sea for the first time,
with the sunrise on it...

700
00:44:27,613 --> 00:44:29,843
...and thinking how beautifuI it was.

701
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:33,644
lt was only the British Channel...

702
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:37,282
...but it seemed
a long way from home in 1939.

703
00:44:38,253 --> 00:44:40,244
And so, it was a mixture...

704
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:45,091
...of eIation because we saw something
so beautifuI, and saw the sea, whiIe this...

705
00:44:45,173 --> 00:44:48,722
...fear within me, which never Ieft me
for those six years, of:

706
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:50,765
"´What´s going to happen...

707
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,288
"´...at home?"´

708
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,846
Refugees from terror.

709
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:02,083
The first boatload from Nazi Germany.

710
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,967
Vanguard of an army of helpless children.

711
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:08,446
Uprooted from their homeland
in a modern exodus.

712
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,967
Each Kindertransport
was lead by adult escorts...

713
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:14,886
...on the condition that
after delivering the children...

714
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:17,043
...all escorts would return home...

715
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:19,607
...or else the transports would be ended.

716
00:45:20,293 --> 00:45:22,409
A couple of times l traveled with them.

717
00:45:22,493 --> 00:45:25,007
At one transport the customs official...

718
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:28,087
...checked and said, ´´We have a problem. ´´

719
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,484
He said, ´´This young man here
brought a violin...

720
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:35,529
´´...which is very, very expensive.

721
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:38,563
´´This is not an ordinary violin. ´´

722
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:41,689
I said, "´WeII, don´t forget...

723
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:45,083
"´...these young peopIe
take music Iessons...

724
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:47,641
"´...and obviousIy
he Iiked music very much...

725
00:45:47,733 --> 00:45:49,769
"´...so he took his vioIin aIong."´

726
00:45:51,213 --> 00:45:52,851
This didn´t sit weII...

727
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:54,692
...so l gambled.

728
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:56,371
l said to that boy:

729
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:59,286
´´Can you play something?´´
And he said, ´´Sure. ´´

730
00:46:13,973 --> 00:46:16,362
And he was playing God Save the King.

731
00:46:27,413 --> 00:46:29,324
And that boy couldn´t be stopped.

732
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:31,483
He played all three stanzas.

733
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,846
When he was finished...

734
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:41,128
...the guard Iooked very happy.

735
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:45,087
I asked the feIIow, "´Are you now
convinced, sir, that he Iikes music?"´

736
00:46:45,653 --> 00:46:47,052
And he said, "´Yes! "´

737
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:50,326
So, the boy got his vioIin into EngIand.

738
00:46:53,493 --> 00:46:55,449
Then came the arrival...

739
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:57,764
...at Liverpool Street Station.

740
00:46:58,093 --> 00:47:00,402
Everyone was being picked up...

741
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:02,332
...and l wasn´t.

742
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,762
l remember sitting
in an enormous arrival hall.

743
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:09,647
And l just sat.

744
00:47:10,133 --> 00:47:12,931
Nobody came to me, nobody taIked to me.

745
00:47:15,173 --> 00:47:17,323
I think I must have sat for an hour.

746
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,971
Maybe longer, l don´t know.

747
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:23,691
Then came two people...

748
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:25,525
...who were my guardians...

749
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:27,810
...and they introduced themseIves.

750
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:30,361
They expIained that they Iived in LincoIn.

751
00:47:31,253 --> 00:47:33,562
They didn´t speak one word of German...

752
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:36,401
...and I didn´t speak one word of EngIish.

753
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:39,607
If they said, "´LincoIn,"´
that couId have been...

754
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:40,682
...anywhere.

755
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:42,411
Never heard of the pIace.

756
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,205
My mother sent me off saying:

757
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:48,966
´´Whoever is going to be good enough
to take you in...

758
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,645
´´...and give you a home...

759
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:53,201
´´...you must treat as a temporary mother. ´´

760
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,371
When we arrived back
from LiverpooI Street...

761
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:58,844
...and we aII went to bed...

762
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:00,926
...in the evening...

763
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:03,573
...I went up to her,
put my arms around her...

764
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:05,325
...and she pushed me away.

765
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,367
And her words were, "´That´s sissy."´

766
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:12,248
She may have said something eIse Iike,
"´We don´t do this, that´s sissy."´

767
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:15,166
But the words "´That´s sissy"´
have never Ieft me.

768
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:21,131
The children arrived in England
at the rate of about 300 a week.

769
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:24,573
Those who were not already placed
in foster homes...

770
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,609
...were taken to temporary centers...

771
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:29,207
...hastily set up in summer holiday camps...

772
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,772
...like Dovercourt.

773
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:47,882
They did try and keep us busy.

774
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,126
The memorable part
of this camp experience was...

775
00:48:52,453 --> 00:48:56,082
...that it was one
of the coldest winters in history.

776
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:01,765
We all went for breakfast to this big hall.

777
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:04,649
The snow came in through the cracks.

778
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:09,162
We had this curious food. We had kippers.

779
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:12,370
What IittIe Austrian-Jewish chiId
has ever heard of kippers?

780
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:14,967
Here was this saIty,
shoe Ieather on our pIates...

781
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:17,692
...and it had snow on it. It was interesting.

782
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:20,252
While we were sitting...

783
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,767
...around the stove,
always with our coats on...

784
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:24,969
...and with our little gloves on...

785
00:49:25,053 --> 00:49:27,726
...groups of people would come...

786
00:49:28,853 --> 00:49:32,050
...to choose children
to take away with them.

787
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:36,648
We called it the ´´Cattle Market´´...

788
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,883
...because every Saturday and Sunday...

789
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:41,533
...we were told to put on our best clothes...

790
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:44,207
...and visitors used to come.
We feIt a bit Iike...

791
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:45,726
...the monkeys in the zoo.

792
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:48,122
We were being stared at and evaIuated.

793
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:51,888
PeopIe were chosen, taken away
from the tabIes, and interviewed...

794
00:49:52,253 --> 00:49:55,245
...if you were suitable
to be taken to their families.

795
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,166
Most families...

796
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:00,007
...wanted little blue-eyed and blonde girls...

797
00:50:00,093 --> 00:50:01,845
...of about three to seven.

798
00:50:02,213 --> 00:50:03,965
Little boys were accepted as well.

799
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:07,011
And the older children found it
a bit more difficult...

800
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:08,606
...to find foster parents.

801
00:50:08,693 --> 00:50:12,242
Of course, by that time,
they hastiIy estabIished hosteIs...

802
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:15,491
...to take a big infIux of the chiIdren...

803
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:19,043
...who weren´t chosen quickIy,
because we had to be chosen fast.

804
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:20,925
ln and out, the camp was filled.

805
00:50:21,013 --> 00:50:23,527
Every week,
another transport would arrive.

806
00:50:27,093 --> 00:50:29,368
l was writing a letter to my parents...

807
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,849
...and one of these ladies in a fur coat...

808
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:35,849
...bent down to me and asked me...

809
00:50:35,973 --> 00:50:38,362
...if l would like to come to Liverpool.

810
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:41,406
I said, "´Yes, I wouId Iike
to come to LiverpooI."´

811
00:50:41,493 --> 00:50:44,769
She said to the other woman,
"´Oh, she speaks EngIish."´

812
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,287
By speaking EngIish, I mean,
I couId understand:

813
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:50,331
"´WouId you Iike to come to LiverpooI?"´
And I couId say "´Yes."´

814
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,722
Then they said to me, "´Are you Orthodox?"´

815
00:50:52,813 --> 00:50:54,007
I said, "´Yes."´

816
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:55,926
They wrote that down.

817
00:50:56,973 --> 00:51:00,602
lt was understood that l was going to go
to Liverpool the next day...

818
00:51:00,693 --> 00:51:02,604
...and when the ladies had gone...

819
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:06,481
...I wrote in my Ietter to my parents,
"´By the way, what is Orthodox?"´

820
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:10,363
My brother had been chosen first...

821
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:13,252
...to be the playmate
of a little boy in Coventry.

822
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:16,006
Then they asked me if l´d like to go
to a family there.

823
00:51:16,093 --> 00:51:19,802
Of course, l jumped at the chance.
l wanted to be near my little brother.

824
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:23,727
They chose me as a maid, but I didn´t know
I was supposed to be a maid.

825
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:28,729
l hadn´t ever thought
of becoming a servant.

826
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:35,009
But I drew the Iine.
I point bIank refused to wear a uniform.

827
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:38,324
I think they took me
to show off in front of the neighbors...

828
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:40,881
...because they were working-cIass peopIe.

829
00:51:41,853 --> 00:51:43,889
The culture shock was very great...

830
00:51:43,973 --> 00:51:47,170
...and also the fact that my clothes
were better than hers.

831
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:49,050
She took great exception to that...

832
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:51,249
...and she took the clothes and all.

833
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:54,242
The chiIdren whom we brought over
and pIaced...

834
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:57,325
...I think, in the main, were satisfactory.

835
00:51:58,773 --> 00:52:00,684
One can never cIaim 100 percent.

836
00:52:00,773 --> 00:52:02,684
There were certainIy some who weren´t.

837
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:05,048
There were certainIy some
who were misused...

838
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:08,125
...and used as servants
if they were of the right age.

839
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:12,924
l wouldn´t claim that it was
a 100-percent success, but...

840
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,406
...I wouId cIaim that everybody
who came was aIive at the end of the war.

841
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:22,249
You felt you wanted to do something.

842
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,963
There was a meeting in Norwich...

843
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:29,252
...of a few Jewish congregates,
and non-Jewish.

844
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:31,842
They said, "´Any offers to take chiIdren?"´

845
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:33,605
My husband and I said yes.

846
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:37,962
Then some photographs
were handed around.

847
00:52:39,453 --> 00:52:41,808
I remember there were some boy twins.

848
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:45,808
My heart ached,
but we couIdn´t afford it in those days.

849
00:52:45,893 --> 00:52:48,282
We didn´t know what was going to happen.

850
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,012
So that´s when...

851
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:51,412
...we took Kurt.

852
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:54,763
Percy and Mariam...

853
00:52:55,093 --> 00:52:57,004
...picked me up at the boat...

854
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:59,324
...and took me back home.

855
00:52:59,773 --> 00:53:01,764
At the entrance stood...

856
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:05,922
...the maid who, I wouId Iearn Iater,
actuaIIy ran the househoId...

857
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:09,323
...and haIfway up the stairs
sat a IittIe boy of five...

858
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,444
...Iooking at his "´new"´ brother.

859
00:53:14,013 --> 00:53:16,368
When we got home,
my maid, SeIena, was there...

860
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,849
...and she said to me,
"´Can´t we change it?"´

861
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:21,163
He was fiIthy, you know, and smeIt...

862
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:23,651
...of sick and everything.

863
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,244
Anyhow, we gave him a bath.

864
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:31,643
My grubby clothes,
after three days of travel, were torn off me.

865
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:33,445
Burned, l learnt later.

866
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,603
l was scrubbed from head to toe...

867
00:53:35,973 --> 00:53:38,362
...and then dressed in English clothes.

868
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,250
Then the famiIy got together
for a chicken dinner.

869
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:46,410
That I remember.
That´s a Ianguage I couId understand.

870
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:50,888
And I started to feeI more at ease.

871
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:53,806
l learned English...

872
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:57,683
...by being sent to a German man,
rather old...

873
00:53:58,093 --> 00:54:01,165
...who lived a few houses down
the same street.

874
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:04,204
Maybe I thought he was a Nazi...

875
00:54:04,293 --> 00:54:06,363
...but I was terrified of him.

876
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:11,088
In fact, I was so terrified that I Iearned...

877
00:54:11,173 --> 00:54:14,245
...EngIish so quick
so I wouIdn´t have to see him again.

878
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:17,004
Then six weeks Iater...

879
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:19,323
...I wrote to my parents in EngIish:

880
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,490
"´I no Ionger speak German."´

881
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:25,325
I never have,
and I´ve never been abIe to re-Iearn it.

882
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,971
He was very, very good.

883
00:54:29,653 --> 00:54:32,884
He liked the sweet things
and John liked the savory, but...

884
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:35,089
...they got on very well together.

885
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:38,487
But I noticed, weII, we knew every night...

886
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:40,962
...when it was dark,
he´d come down the stairs...

887
00:54:41,053 --> 00:54:44,932
...and he´d see that the door was Iocked.
That was one thing I remember.

888
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:55,889
My mother was in London,
so for me the separation...

889
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:59,244
...was not as traumatic
because l was going to something.

890
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:02,283
l came to the London station...

891
00:55:02,373 --> 00:55:05,570
...and she picked me up
and took me where she was working.

892
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:07,969
Then I stayed in this very coId...

893
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,725
...fancy house in EngIand...

894
00:55:11,813 --> 00:55:14,566
...where they were expIoiting
the European maids.

895
00:55:15,013 --> 00:55:18,289
And, of course,
if you´ve ever been the chiId of a maid...

896
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:21,046
...you know maids
aren´t supposed to have chiIdren.

897
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:23,647
They´re not weIcome. You can´t stay there.

898
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:27,967
l don´t know how the decision was made,
but l was to be sent to Belfast...

899
00:55:28,053 --> 00:55:30,965
...to the Jewish refugee hostel in Belfast.

900
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:34,046
When you see your life has been saved
and you´re brought into a hostel...

901
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:36,763
...which is clean...

902
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,762
...and there is food there...

903
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,328
...and other children there,
how could you not be happy in that place?

904
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:46,177
But, to me...

905
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:49,227
...it smeIIed of orphanage,
which, in due course, it became.

906
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:50,576
And orphanages...

907
00:55:51,988 --> 00:55:53,819
...those things frighten
every chiId out of its wits.

908
00:55:53,908 --> 00:55:55,387
I mean, CharIes Dickens...

909
00:55:56,743 --> 00:55:58,461
...to be in a workhouse, to be an orphan.

910
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:08,301
My first impression of Waddesdon Manor
was like a dream...

911
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:11,102
...like a castle l´ve seen in pictures...

912
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:15,012
...but never in person.

913
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,619
The Cedars was a servants´ house.

914
00:56:18,063 --> 00:56:20,258
Twenty-six of us lived in The Cedars.

915
00:56:24,703 --> 00:56:27,661
The first thing we did
was throw a soccer ball on the lawn...

916
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:29,222
...and kicked it around.

917
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,454
The local boys wanted to see what was,
all of a sudden...

918
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:35,097
...being brought into their little village.

919
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,054
When it was time for dinner...

920
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:40,891
...they said:

921
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:43,815
"´We´II see you tomorrow."´

922
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:47,376
I was so excited.

923
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:50,139
I was absoIuteIy so exuberant.

924
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:53,178
I ran to my housemother...

925
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,856
...and toId her:

926
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:58,620
"´Somebody who´s not Jewish
wants to see me tomorrow."´

927
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:02,972
We did start going to school there.

928
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:05,894
lt was marvelous.

929
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:07,776
l never realized
what school was really like.

930
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,856
That you couId participate.

931
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:15,060
And I did enjoy going to schooI.

932
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:18,342
And the wonderfuI part about it
was that it had a Iibrary.

933
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:22,343
l waded through that library...

934
00:57:22,424 --> 00:57:24,096
...and that´s how l learned
to speak English.

935
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,652
Through that
I got a Iove of EngIish Iiterature.

936
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,779
But aItogether...

937
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:36,173
...it was a wonderfuI experience,
and the chiIdren were so friendIy to us.

938
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,332
l knew that l was going...

939
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,888
...to a school near Bournemouth in Dorset.

940
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,417
lt was the headmistress of the school
who guaranteed...

941
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,613
...to look after me.

942
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,850
When l arrived at the school,
it was all these girls...

943
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,339
...who were very polite...

944
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,251
...and very nice, very kind.

945
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,971
I couIdn´t understand a word they said.

946
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,493
I was given my bed.

947
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,533
The curtains couId be drawn,
to give me some privacy.

948
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,531
The first thing I did was...

949
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,217
...put a picture of my parents
on the bedside table...

950
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,776
...so l could say goodnight to them.

951
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,098
The first three months
before war broke out...

952
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,097
...we couId stiII write home.

953
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,092
So I couId share my experiences
with my parents...

954
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,410
...and I had Ietters very frequentIy.

955
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,339
So I didn´t feeI quite so isoIated.

956
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,252
´´As you can well imagine...

957
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,934
´´...you have been constantly
in our thoughts.

958
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,693
´´We still see your face before us
in that window...

959
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,657
´´...of the railway carriage. ´´

960
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,852
´´My dearest little mouse:

961
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,450
´´Hopefully this letter will reach you...

962
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,215
´´...already in your new home,
where you surely will enjoy your stay.

963
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,371
´´Be a very good little girl.

964
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,094
´´Be obedient. ´´

965
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,579
´´Dear Parents:

966
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,293
´´How are you both?

967
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,335
´´Today l had my first English lesson.

968
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,211
´´Greetings and kisses. ´´

969
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,253
´´l was very happy
with your dear little letter...

970
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,898
´´...only there shouldn´t be
so many spelling errors! ´´

971
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,858
´´lf only l could see you
just for a tiny moment...

972
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,015
´´...but, as it is,
l can only write letters full of longing. ´´

973
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,932
´´Dear Daddy: Thank you very much...

974
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,937
´´...for the game of cards...

975
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,172
´´...and the brooches...

976
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,371
´´...and the bracelet.

977
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,771
´´l had a game with them. ´´

978
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,096
´´l keep running to the mailbox.

979
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,775
´´Every line from you overwhelms me.

980
00:59:53,016 --> 00:59:54,495
´´Every day l thank God
that you are in such good hands...

981
00:59:54,896 --> 00:59:56,409
´´...but please show your gratefulness. ´´

982
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:02,949
´´My dear, good, darling parents:

983
01:00:04,154 --> 01:00:04,984
´´l feel very safe here.

984
01:00:05,074 --> 01:00:07,144
´´lf only l was not so very scared...

985
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:08,150
´´...about your safety. ´´

986
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:16,067
´´For my birthday, you wrote me...

987
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:18,458
´´...that l´ll always have to be brave...

988
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:21,109
´´...because you can´t be happy if l´m not.

989
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:22,862
´´And l can assure you...

990
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:25,588
´´...that l always grit my teeth and smile. ´´

991
01:00:28,989 --> 01:00:31,378
´´Your letter of yesterday
was again so sweet...

992
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:33,505
´´...and written with so much love...

993
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:36,467
´´...that tears came running down
your Mommy´s face.

994
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:39,020
´´Your writing is so natural...

995
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:42,181
´´...it makes me imagine
that you´re standing before me. ´´

996
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:47,063
´´Your letters come to us like sunshine.

997
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:50,423
´´lt´s our future that gives us big worries.

998
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:52,860
´´We yearn to get away from here.

999
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:54,861
´´That´s our fondest wish.

1000
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:58,819
´´lt´ll be a difficult task for you
to bring us over there...

1001
01:00:59,069 --> 01:01:02,027
´´...but l have the feeling
you´ll manage it in time. ´´

1002
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:09,141
When l arrived in England...

1003
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:11,140
...l made it my priority...

1004
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:13,738
...to try and find homes for people...

1005
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:16,065
...because l felt people didn´t know...

1006
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:18,265
...how desperate it was in Germany.

1007
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:22,067
My biggest probIem
was to try and get my parents out.

1008
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:26,303
That was difficult,
because it was either finding them a job...

1009
01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:29,418
...and bearing in mind my father´s age...

1010
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:32,905
...or getting this 100 guarantee...

1011
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,219
...which was just nowhere to be seen.

1012
01:01:37,749 --> 01:01:39,262
l proceeded...

1013
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:41,786
...to find large houses...

1014
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:45,189
...and knock at the door to find out...

1015
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:47,459
...whether l could get them a job.

1016
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:52,067
My mother as a cook or bottle washer.

1017
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:53,787
My father as a gardener.

1018
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:56,060
Anything just to get them out.

1019
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:59,820
Sometimes l knocked at the door
and l burst into tears.

1020
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:04,428
Sometimes l knocked at the door,
and with my very poor English...

1021
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,263
...tried to explain what it was all about...

1022
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,705
...who I was, what I wanted,
what I needed: heIp.

1023
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:14,108
I did find someone...

1024
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:17,058
...and it was just...

1025
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:20,142
...Iike an unbeIievabIe dream come true.

1026
01:02:23,589 --> 01:02:26,467
My father had a first cousin...

1027
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:27,978
...in London.

1028
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:31,507
Every weekend l took the train
into London...

1029
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,226
...and bombarded him.

1030
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:36,462
l said, ´´Uncle Paul...

1031
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:39,828
"´...you´ve got to get my parents
out of Germany."´

1032
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,700
He said, "´I can´t do it."´

1033
01:02:44,629 --> 01:02:47,348
After me being so...

1034
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,385
...insistent he finally said:

1035
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:52,781
"´I´II give him an affidavit
if he has a working permit."´

1036
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,583
l went back to the Rothschild estate...

1037
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,781
...knocked on the door...

1038
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:04,218
...and the butIer,
who was about 10-foot-6...

1039
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:05,537
...came out ...

1040
01:03:07,469 --> 01:03:08,902
...and said to me:

1041
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:10,942
"´What do you want?"´

1042
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:14,343
I said,
"´I want to speak to Baron RothschiId."´

1043
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,466
He said, "´Wait here."´

1044
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:21,578
I waited.

1045
01:03:23,309 --> 01:03:25,425
A coupIe of minutes Iater he says:

1046
01:03:26,109 --> 01:03:27,224
"´FoIIow me."´

1047
01:03:29,149 --> 01:03:31,140
l said to him, ´´Baron Rothschild...

1048
01:03:31,229 --> 01:03:34,107
´´...my father´s cousin will give him...

1049
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:36,347
´´...and my mother a visa...

1050
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:38,704
´´...provided he has a working permit. ´´

1051
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:41,468
Without hesitation...

1052
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:44,947
...he said to me,
"´WouId he work on a chicken farm?"´

1053
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:47,860
I said, "´He´II do anything."´

1054
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:50,739
He went to a notary...

1055
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,781
...and made out a working permit
for my parents.

1056
01:03:56,878 --> 01:04:00,666
The family that chose me
were the only people...

1057
01:04:01,118 --> 01:04:03,951
...l could rely on to give...

1058
01:04:04,358 --> 01:04:06,030
...a visa for my IittIe sister.

1059
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:08,712
She was a beautifuI IittIe girI.
They had no chiIdren.

1060
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:10,868
I showed them the photograph of Inge...

1061
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:13,313
...and they seemed to like her very much.

1062
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:15,036
But l realized one thing:

1063
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:17,026
Uncle Billy...

1064
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:19,035
...hated red hair.

1065
01:04:19,678 --> 01:04:20,872
UncIe BiIIy...

1066
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:25,675
...was paying maintenance
for a red-haired chiId, not his...

1067
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:27,351
...by his first wife.

1068
01:04:27,758 --> 01:04:29,316
WeII, say no more.

1069
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,673
Inge was a bright redhead.

1070
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:36,668
The question of hair color never arose
because l had brown hair.

1071
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:39,796
One day he said to me quite idly:

1072
01:04:39,878 --> 01:04:42,187
´´What color hair does your sister have?´´

1073
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,109
l said, ´´Oh, like mine. ´´

1074
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:45,517
No more was said.

1075
01:04:46,438 --> 01:04:48,190
And they gave permission for her...

1076
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:50,553
...to come and they wouId take her in.

1077
01:04:53,078 --> 01:04:55,512
l went very happily to England.

1078
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:59,193
lt was an adventure, you know,
to go abroad, to go on the train.

1079
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:02,548
My sister wrote fantastic letters.

1080
01:05:03,038 --> 01:05:04,790
Everything was wonderful.

1081
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:07,155
She was having a marvelous time.

1082
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:10,389
So was my brother.
My brother said he had a dog.

1083
01:05:12,878 --> 01:05:15,756
When I got there
actuaIIy there was a dog and a cat.

1084
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:16,827
The dog bit me.

1085
01:05:16,918 --> 01:05:18,749
I didn´t think much of that.

1086
01:05:19,998 --> 01:05:23,115
lnge arrived, her hair aflame...

1087
01:05:23,278 --> 01:05:24,870
...titian-red....

1088
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:27,836
Uncle Billy was furious.

1089
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:30,878
He turned around
and he caIIed me a so-and-so Iiar.

1090
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,710
I said to him:

1091
01:05:33,118 --> 01:05:35,393
"´Because Inge has red hair...

1092
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:37,230
"´...I Ieave her at home in Germany?

1093
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:39,673
"´Now you send her away. Don´t mind.

1094
01:05:39,758 --> 01:05:41,749
"´Thank you for asking her here."´

1095
01:05:41,998 --> 01:05:45,388
He caImed down in the end
and he did accept her into the house.

1096
01:05:48,998 --> 01:05:50,590
l think, l had a sense...

1097
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:53,272
...while l was playing,
while l was laughing...

1098
01:05:53,478 --> 01:05:58,393
...that was the moment when I couId and
shouId´ve been doing something about...

1099
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,477
...this demand on me...

1100
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:04,833
...that I shouId bring my parents out.

1101
01:06:06,518 --> 01:06:09,828
From Dovercourt camp
l wrote a couple of letters...

1102
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:12,592
...to the Refugee Committee in London.

1103
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:15,873
l think they must have been moved
by a letter...

1104
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:19,428
...from a child asking
to get her parents out of Vienna.

1105
01:06:19,678 --> 01:06:23,068
They did get my parents
a domestic service visa.

1106
01:06:23,198 --> 01:06:26,474
My parents appeared miraculously...

1107
01:06:26,598 --> 01:06:29,317
...in Liverpool on my 1 1th birthday.

1108
01:06:31,198 --> 01:06:33,393
I remember feeIing...

1109
01:06:33,558 --> 01:06:35,913
...that some terrific...

1110
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:38,114
...weight that I had been carrying...

1111
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:40,666
...and hadn´t known I had been carrying...

1112
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:42,595
...was taken off my back.

1113
01:06:48,518 --> 01:06:50,986
Everything was being done
to get the papers...

1114
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,955
...for my parents to come out...

1115
01:06:53,038 --> 01:06:54,266
...and war started.

1116
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:56,235
And that was the end of that.

1117
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:06,630
l just felt the world had come to an end.

1118
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:09,594
Shattering, if l think about it.

1119
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:11,710
Everything was buiIt...

1120
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:14,116
...around this reunion...

1121
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,632
...and my temporary stay in EngIand.

1122
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:22,549
The fateful hour of 1 1:00 has struck...

1123
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:26,677
...and the state of war once more exists
between Great Britain and Germany.

1124
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:33,229
Only 25 minutes after war was declared
came the first air-raid warning.

1125
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:41,433
Everything...

1126
01:07:41,518 --> 01:07:44,271
...we´d ever talked about or written about...

1127
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:47,273
...or thought about, had all collapsed.

1128
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:49,510
Everything had collapsed.

1129
01:07:50,598 --> 01:07:52,395
I think I cried for...

1130
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:56,193
...not weeks, not months, I cried for years.

1131
01:07:59,998 --> 01:08:03,195
War ended all Kindertransports
and legal immigration...

1132
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:05,348
...from Central Europe to England.

1133
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:09,757
lt also ended regular mail
between the children and their parents.

1134
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:12,313
The only way
they could now communicate...

1135
01:08:12,398 --> 01:08:16,994
...was by 25-word postcards
sent through the lnternational Red Cross.

1136
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:24,514
The isolation came
when the letters ceased.

1137
01:08:25,038 --> 01:08:28,633
It was accepted
that you didn´t taIk about...

1138
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:30,630
...what hurt you.

1139
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:32,829
I couIdn´t speak Czech with anybody.

1140
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:35,671
I didn´t want to teII my sister
how unhappy I was...

1141
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:38,272
...because I feIt she was too young.

1142
01:08:39,438 --> 01:08:41,713
l wrote at that time in my diary:

1143
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:44,557
´´l never dreamt
that one could be so lonely...

1144
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:46,276
´´...and go on living...

1145
01:08:46,358 --> 01:08:49,907
´´...with this constant fear
for our loved ones.

1146
01:08:50,078 --> 01:08:53,514
´´The tears l shed at night
do not ease my pain...

1147
01:08:53,678 --> 01:08:57,512
´´...yet l was told that one feels better
after a good cry.

1148
01:08:57,678 --> 01:09:00,067
´´All l have is a swollen face...

1149
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,468
´´...and my heart
is as heavy as it was before. ´´

1150
01:09:04,878 --> 01:09:08,473
My piIIow often was very wet
in the morning.

1151
01:09:11,918 --> 01:09:13,590
There was a gardener...

1152
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:16,994
...who didn´t understand perhaps
what l was going through.

1153
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:20,946
But he always said to me,
´´Don´t worry, it won´t last long. ´´

1154
01:09:21,718 --> 01:09:25,154
And whether I beIieved him or not
it was good to hear him say that.

1155
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:26,956
And he aIways gave me a fIower.

1156
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,866
Within a few months
of their arrival in England...

1157
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:34,712
...many of the refugees,
along with other English children...

1158
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:37,915
...were forced to evacuate
to new families in the country...

1159
01:09:37,998 --> 01:09:40,876
...to escape the expected bombing
of the cities.

1160
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:45,553
-You consented to take two chiIdren?
-Yes, I´II take in two chiIdren.

1161
01:09:45,638 --> 01:09:48,789
Two IittIe girIs.
They´II be happy with you, I´m sure.

1162
01:09:48,878 --> 01:09:51,631
-Thank you very much.
-Two nice IittIe girIs, aren´t they?

1163
01:09:51,718 --> 01:09:54,391
None of the foster parents
with whom l stayed...

1164
01:09:54,478 --> 01:09:56,230
...and there were five of them...

1165
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:58,673
...none of them could stand me
for very long.

1166
01:09:58,758 --> 01:10:03,627
All of them had the grace
to take in a Jewish child.

1167
01:10:04,918 --> 01:10:07,148
They were not particuIarIy warm.

1168
01:10:07,478 --> 01:10:09,469
They did not Iove me.

1169
01:10:09,558 --> 01:10:11,435
I did not Iove them.

1170
01:10:11,638 --> 01:10:15,267
NevertheIess, they did,
as I say, what most of us don´t do...

1171
01:10:15,638 --> 01:10:19,074
...which is to burden the househoId...

1172
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:22,753
...the kitchens, the bedroom
and the Iiving room with this foreigner.

1173
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:28,350
Mariam was somewhat aloof.

1174
01:10:28,518 --> 01:10:30,713
lt was her manner. She was loving, but...

1175
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:34,029
...she didn´t hug and kiss me.
My mother was the exact opposite.

1176
01:10:34,118 --> 01:10:36,916
She used to not just kiss me once...

1177
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:40,748
...she sort of kissed me Iike "´rat-tat-tat,"´
Iike a machine gun.

1178
01:10:41,038 --> 01:10:44,189
But Mariam was distant and nice...

1179
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:46,234
...and I think that´s what I needed...

1180
01:10:46,318 --> 01:10:48,593
...because I had troubIe...

1181
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,470
...reaIIy...

1182
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:52,795
...feeIing that I beIonged there.

1183
01:10:52,878 --> 01:10:56,188
To have sort of pushed me into it
wouId have been difficuIt.

1184
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:57,950
He didn´t cry, not at aII.

1185
01:10:58,038 --> 01:10:59,869
I couIdn´t understand it.

1186
01:11:00,878 --> 01:11:02,789
This is London calling.

1187
01:11:03,078 --> 01:11:04,431
Just once...

1188
01:11:04,518 --> 01:11:07,954
...they used to like to listen
to some programs on the wireless.

1189
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:11,675
He used to come sit on my knee.

1190
01:11:11,758 --> 01:11:13,191
And there was something...

1191
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:16,031
...in the news, I just heard him once go....

1192
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:18,473
A IittIe sob and that was aII.

1193
01:11:20,758 --> 01:11:24,068
l tried really to please the Cohens
because l loved them...

1194
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:26,269
...and l felt very dependent.

1195
01:11:26,358 --> 01:11:29,509
One of my main worries
was that l would be...

1196
01:11:29,598 --> 01:11:30,917
...sent away.

1197
01:11:31,398 --> 01:11:35,152
I know this happened to another boy,
somewhat oIder...

1198
01:11:35,518 --> 01:11:38,351
...who was taken in
by some friends of the Cohens.

1199
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:41,748
He was arrogant and impossibIe...

1200
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:46,071
...and eventuaIIy they simpIy
had to send him to some other home.

1201
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:48,911
I´d heard of other pIaces
where this had happened.

1202
01:11:48,998 --> 01:11:51,114
So I feIt very much...

1203
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:52,517
...on edge.

1204
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:58,632
Word came that my mother
was no longer in London.

1205
01:11:58,798 --> 01:12:00,868
She went back to Vienna...

1206
01:12:01,118 --> 01:12:04,269
...to get my father to move,
who was impassive.

1207
01:12:05,438 --> 01:12:08,748
So I reaIIy did make up my mind
that I wouId be as tough as naiIs.

1208
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:12,228
Nothing wouId hurt me.
I wouId have no emotions.

1209
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:16,387
And it carried me through
for about six or seven years.

1210
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:21,267
l got a scholarship to a grammar school.

1211
01:12:21,358 --> 01:12:23,667
People were saying to me,
partly in jealousy:

1212
01:12:23,758 --> 01:12:27,433
´´You know, they are snobs
in these schools and they´re anti-Semites.

1213
01:12:27,878 --> 01:12:31,188
´´You gotta watch yourself.
They´re gonna take it out on you. ´´

1214
01:12:31,318 --> 01:12:32,831
And l went to school.

1215
01:12:33,678 --> 01:12:36,112
I had a schooI tie, I guess...

1216
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:39,594
...or a bIazer.
I was just entering a new worId.

1217
01:12:40,758 --> 01:12:42,237
The sun was shining.

1218
01:12:42,318 --> 01:12:46,152
I went to schooI, and a feIIow came up
to me and said, "´Who are you?"´

1219
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:48,194
And I just knocked him down.

1220
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:53,989
There was no doubt a cost...

1221
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,275
...trying to be good aII the time
and keeping my anger in.

1222
01:12:58,478 --> 01:13:00,628
Only once did it slip.

1223
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:04,194
One day John and l
were having breakfast...

1224
01:13:04,358 --> 01:13:08,397
...and there was some silly argument
over who got the marmalade first.

1225
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:13,436
And Kurt threw a knife.
That was the onIy time he was naughty.

1226
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:18,592
John had a IittIe wound here,
which was near his eye. It wasn´t nice.

1227
01:13:19,278 --> 01:13:22,748
Dr. Rose, who was our friend,
and Iived a few doors down...

1228
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:25,352
...he came in and he was furious.

1229
01:13:25,438 --> 01:13:28,510
"´You shouIdn´t have taken this chiId in."´

1230
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:33,033
lt terrified the entire family and me, too.

1231
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:37,709
Since then l´ve been somewhat afraid
of my possibility of letting go to anger.

1232
01:13:37,838 --> 01:13:41,035
The other signs
that l had a lot inside me was that...

1233
01:13:41,118 --> 01:13:43,632
...l always had some intestinal problems...

1234
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:48,670
...untiI I went into the army, and then I had
the most terribIe food and feIt fine.

1235
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,476
I have an anaIogy for this:

1236
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:53,595
When aII of us
have had the experience of finding...

1237
01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:55,436
...a bird with a broken wing...

1238
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:58,555
...and you pick up this bird
and you hoId it in your hand...

1239
01:13:58,638 --> 01:14:01,994
...and you think it´s going to sit there,
quietIy, sweetIy...

1240
01:14:02,078 --> 01:14:05,514
...with its warm feathers, and be darIing.

1241
01:14:05,678 --> 01:14:08,067
It´s not. It immediateIy tries...

1242
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:12,430
...to use its muscIes and it´s a very
uncomfortabIe thing to hoId in your hand...

1243
01:14:12,518 --> 01:14:15,874
...because there´s this fIuttering.
What he wants is to get away.

1244
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:18,950
It may need you to hoId it and nurse it...

1245
01:14:19,078 --> 01:14:22,115
...but what he wants
is to get the heck out of there.

1246
01:14:22,198 --> 01:14:24,473
I think that´s what we were Iike.

1247
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:28,228
CertainIy, that´s what I was Iike.
I was not nice to have around.

1248
01:14:37,318 --> 01:14:39,548
l got a new job in London...

1249
01:14:39,638 --> 01:14:44,075
...and l was working there
until June 28, 1940.

1250
01:14:44,638 --> 01:14:47,357
lt was lunchtime
and l was having a sandwich...

1251
01:14:47,438 --> 01:14:49,952
...when suddenIy two guys appeared.
Two men.

1252
01:14:51,398 --> 01:14:52,626
"´CID."´

1253
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:58,554
"´What have I done?"´
"´Nothing. You are Abrascha GorbuIski?

1254
01:14:58,718 --> 01:15:00,868
"´You are now under arrest."´

1255
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,755
"´Under arrest?

1256
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:03,873
"´For what?"´

1257
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,677
"´You are an enemy aIien,
pIease come with us."´

1258
01:15:08,078 --> 01:15:10,467
After Germany invaded Western Europe...

1259
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:14,268
...the British began rounding up
all refugees from Germany and Austria...

1260
01:15:14,358 --> 01:15:16,792
...who were over the age of 16.

1261
01:15:17,438 --> 01:15:21,033
Although the vast majority
were refugees from Nazi persecution...

1262
01:15:21,478 --> 01:15:25,153
...anyone with a foreign accent
was viewed as a potential saboteur.

1263
01:15:25,838 --> 01:15:27,271
Within a few months...

1264
01:15:27,358 --> 01:15:31,112
...the government interned approximately
30,000 men and women.

1265
01:15:32,118 --> 01:15:35,269
Plans were made
to deport as many as possible.

1266
01:15:35,918 --> 01:15:39,547
The good thing about Iife is
you remember aII the good things...

1267
01:15:39,678 --> 01:15:41,316
...that happened to you.

1268
01:15:41,438 --> 01:15:43,315
Bad things, you forget about them.

1269
01:15:43,398 --> 01:15:46,834
ln fact, you have to make an effort
to really remember them.

1270
01:15:48,398 --> 01:15:50,628
The day came
when we had to go to the ship.

1271
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:53,512
Soldiers were standing there
with bayonets...

1272
01:15:53,598 --> 01:15:55,316
...mounted on their rifles.

1273
01:15:55,838 --> 01:15:58,227
And they pushed us aIong and said:

1274
01:15:58,318 --> 01:16:02,072
"´Leave your Iuggage, you´II get it Iater on."´
They pushed us aIong the deck.

1275
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,310
Before Iong, we went down the stairs,
then more stairs. I was on the third deck.

1276
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:09,637
Over 2,500 prisoners...

1277
01:16:11,078 --> 01:16:12,909
...twice the capacity of the ship...

1278
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:15,592
...were crammed onto the HMT Dunera...

1279
01:16:15,918 --> 01:16:18,307
...supposedly bound for Canada.

1280
01:16:20,558 --> 01:16:22,389
Two days out of Liverpool...

1281
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:25,630
...the Dunera was spotted
by a German U-boat.

1282
01:16:30,398 --> 01:16:32,229
Suddenly, something hits the ship.

1283
01:16:32,318 --> 01:16:34,036
The lights went out.

1284
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:35,631
This is the end of it.

1285
01:16:35,878 --> 01:16:38,472
Everybody gravitated towards...

1286
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:41,670
...the stairway,
which Ied to the deck above.

1287
01:16:42,518 --> 01:16:44,156
After about two minutes...

1288
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:47,150
...you couIdn´t get up there
because there were many...

1289
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:50,071
...peopIe going up the stairs,
we were just choking.

1290
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:52,718
SuddenIy, the Iights went on again.

1291
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:54,914
Everybody stopped in their...

1292
01:16:55,838 --> 01:16:57,749
...steps and went back down.

1293
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:00,476
The torpedo didn´t explode...

1294
01:17:00,558 --> 01:17:04,346
...but l was under the impression
that the torpedo hit us sideways.

1295
01:17:04,438 --> 01:17:06,713
lt just bounced off.

1296
01:17:07,118 --> 01:17:09,427
Our luck, because if it had hit us...

1297
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:11,907
...all of us would have been finished.

1298
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:18,156
We were traveling,
going west for several days...

1299
01:17:18,878 --> 01:17:20,630
...but suddenIy our outIook said:

1300
01:17:20,718 --> 01:17:24,506
"´Something´s happening and we are not
going west. We´re going south."´

1301
01:17:25,598 --> 01:17:29,876
We had no idea where we were going,
except it must have been Australia.

1302
01:17:30,358 --> 01:17:34,146
We were starving daily.
They were treating us like pigs.

1303
01:17:34,478 --> 01:17:38,027
Being hungry every day,
peopIe were Iining up in the kitchen...

1304
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,276
...to get an empty pot where the jam was,
just to scrape it out.

1305
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:44,469
And having one sIice of bread.

1306
01:17:46,318 --> 01:17:50,755
The existence from one day to another
was worse than the day before.

1307
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:54,393
And we were on the ship
for almost completely two months!

1308
01:17:55,558 --> 01:17:57,276
What happened on the Dunera?

1309
01:17:57,358 --> 01:17:59,110
Years Iater, I´m thinking:

1310
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:02,668
"´This didn´t happen to me.
It must have been somebody eIse...

1311
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:05,431
"´...because it was too horribIe to describe."´

1312
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:11,234
From an overseas liner in Sydney harbor...

1313
01:18:11,318 --> 01:18:14,833
...a strange contingent of new arrivals
is transshipped aboard a ferry.

1314
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:18,991
Enemy aliens who are being interned
in Australia for the duration of the war.

1315
01:18:19,078 --> 01:18:21,467
Before we knew it, we were off the ship.

1316
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:25,310
The first thing l remember
is that each one of us...

1317
01:18:25,398 --> 01:18:27,070
...got a box...

1318
01:18:27,918 --> 01:18:31,877
...of food. That was the best meaI
I ever had in my Iife.

1319
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:34,274
After starving for two months...

1320
01:18:34,398 --> 01:18:37,435
...I opened up the box.
There were two cheese sandwiches...

1321
01:18:37,518 --> 01:18:39,748
...thick Iike this, and a banana...

1322
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:42,637
...and an appIe, and an orange...

1323
01:18:43,038 --> 01:18:45,347
...and they were giving second heIpings.

1324
01:18:45,438 --> 01:18:47,030
It was unbeIievabIe.

1325
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:52,590
As the war progressed...

1326
01:18:52,678 --> 01:18:56,717
...reports of mass arrests and deportation
of Central-European Jews...

1327
01:18:57,038 --> 01:18:58,835
...began to reach Britain.

1328
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:10,676
ln the spring of ´43, the city of Berlin...

1329
01:19:10,758 --> 01:19:13,795
...was cleansed of the last Jews.
They came and took...

1330
01:19:14,478 --> 01:19:16,389
...my famiIy and myseIf aIong.

1331
01:19:16,638 --> 01:19:18,754
We were taken to a coIIection point.

1332
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:21,392
After a coupIe of days, we were deported...

1333
01:19:21,478 --> 01:19:24,595
...to Auschwitz, though we did not know...

1334
01:19:24,758 --> 01:19:27,352
...when we got to the train,
which consisted...

1335
01:19:27,438 --> 01:19:30,191
...of cattIe cars, where we were going.

1336
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:35,793
We landed in Auschwitz
and the moment we landed there...

1337
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:39,069
...we were commanded to leave
the trains...

1338
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:42,470
...women with chiIdren to the Ieft
and men to the right.

1339
01:19:42,638 --> 01:19:46,426
That was the Iast time that I saw my wife,
my then wife, and chiId.

1340
01:19:55,598 --> 01:19:59,511
Lory Cahn and her family
were deported to Theresienstadt...

1341
01:19:59,598 --> 01:20:02,795
...the Czech ghetto the Nazis used
to deceive the world...

1342
01:20:03,038 --> 01:20:05,916
...about how humanely
they treated their prisoners.

1343
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:06,953
ln time...

1344
01:20:07,038 --> 01:20:10,587
...the population of Theresienstadt
exceeded its capacity.

1345
01:20:12,318 --> 01:20:13,353
One day...

1346
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:17,193
...they came into our barrack,
and my name was called...

1347
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:20,510
...to report to the railroad station.

1348
01:20:21,998 --> 01:20:23,909
l went to the railroad station.

1349
01:20:24,998 --> 01:20:28,911
As they called your name,
you had to go and see this SS guy...

1350
01:20:29,038 --> 01:20:32,917
...and he crossed you off the list
and then you went into the car.

1351
01:20:34,118 --> 01:20:37,110
l got there and l repeated my name.

1352
01:20:37,478 --> 01:20:39,309
He said, "´You´re not going."´

1353
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:43,517
I had no idea.
I didn´t dare ask why or what...

1354
01:20:43,598 --> 01:20:46,510
...but that was the end of it
and they sent me back.

1355
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:51,268
And this went on for maybe two weeks.

1356
01:20:52,078 --> 01:20:55,514
l´d been at the railroad station,
l think, four times.

1357
01:20:56,078 --> 01:20:59,229
And l was a complete wreck.

1358
01:21:00,078 --> 01:21:02,546
To say good-bye to your parents...

1359
01:21:02,638 --> 01:21:03,832
...one time...

1360
01:21:03,918 --> 01:21:05,909
...a second time, a third time...

1361
01:21:05,998 --> 01:21:07,351
...and a fourth time...

1362
01:21:07,438 --> 01:21:10,510
...and once before,
when I was in the Kindertransport...

1363
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:12,432
...it was...

1364
01:21:12,558 --> 01:21:14,708
...just absoIuteIy devastating.

1365
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,676
Every time l said good-bye...

1366
01:21:18,758 --> 01:21:21,431
...l think l tore a little piece
out of my mother...

1367
01:21:21,518 --> 01:21:25,193
...and out of my father,
and also a big piece out of myself.

1368
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:28,149
The last time it happened...

1369
01:21:28,398 --> 01:21:29,956
...l said to the guy:

1370
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:32,717
"´WouId you terribIy mind,
but I want to go."´

1371
01:21:33,118 --> 01:21:35,757
"´Are you sure of that?"´ I said, "´Yes."´

1372
01:21:35,918 --> 01:21:38,432
He crossed my name off, and I went.

1373
01:21:41,918 --> 01:21:44,751
Little did l know
that we were going to Auschwitz.

1374
01:21:49,278 --> 01:21:53,351
It was a Iong period where I did not hear
anything from my parents.

1375
01:21:53,998 --> 01:21:56,193
I said, "´WeII, it´s wartime...."´

1376
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,076
I found aII kinds of reasons and excuses.

1377
01:21:59,518 --> 01:22:03,511
Then, finally,
l received a letter from my father...

1378
01:22:03,638 --> 01:22:05,549
...in which he said, ´´Tomorrow...

1379
01:22:05,638 --> 01:22:08,675
´´...l´m going to be deported
to an unknown destination.

1380
01:22:08,918 --> 01:22:12,547
´´And it may be a very long time
before you hear from me again. ´´

1381
01:22:14,878 --> 01:22:17,551
Then l received a letter from my mother.

1382
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:20,076
She said, ´´Tomorrow...

1383
01:22:20,198 --> 01:22:22,632
´´...l´m going to be deported from here. ´´

1384
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:26,631
She encourages me to be good,
and honest...

1385
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:29,955
...and courageous,
and to hold my head high...

1386
01:22:30,318 --> 01:22:32,115
...and to never give up hope.

1387
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:35,713
And this at a time when I think she knew...

1388
01:22:35,878 --> 01:22:37,948
...what might be happening to her.

1389
01:22:41,558 --> 01:22:45,028
Then there was
one more communication from her.

1390
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:49,396
A postcard dated September 4, 1942.

1391
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:52,152
lt´s written in real shaky handwriting.

1392
01:22:52,358 --> 01:22:54,428
She´s saying that she´s traveling...

1393
01:22:54,518 --> 01:22:58,636
...to the East, and is saying
a very final good-bye to me.

1394
01:23:00,878 --> 01:23:03,790
But for many, many years...

1395
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,346
...l would see the postcard in front of me...

1396
01:23:06,438 --> 01:23:08,588
...and l would see she´s saying:

1397
01:23:08,678 --> 01:23:10,236
´´Traveling to the East. ´´

1398
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,957
Yet l would understand that she´s saying...

1399
01:23:13,038 --> 01:23:15,427
...she´s traveling in an easterly direction.

1400
01:23:15,518 --> 01:23:17,236
Then l would say to myself:

1401
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:19,912
"´Maybe she´s going back to Kippenheim.

1402
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,710
"´And maybe that´s good."´

1403
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:24,187
And the finaI good-bye, I didn´t understand.

1404
01:23:32,398 --> 01:23:34,912
l always felt l should be grateful...

1405
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:39,113
...that we´d been saved,
and that these peopIe had taken us in...

1406
01:23:41,118 --> 01:23:43,029
...and that l should be happier there.

1407
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:47,270
But facts are facts,
and it wasn´t a good place to be.

1408
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:49,552
UncIe BiIIy...

1409
01:23:49,638 --> 01:23:51,913
...who was not a very courageous man...

1410
01:23:51,998 --> 01:23:53,716
...every night, he wouId...

1411
01:23:53,998 --> 01:23:56,307
...go into the country,
and he took us with him.

1412
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,753
We went to escape the bombs...

1413
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:02,155
...untiI one day,
the peopIe where we were staying...

1414
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:06,510
...we aII sIept in a room there
in a cottage...

1415
01:24:06,678 --> 01:24:09,988
...and the peopIe said
they didn´t want the German chiIdren.

1416
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:13,987
So we didn´t go to the country anymore.

1417
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:26,756
One day the sirens sounded...

1418
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:30,633
...and what was known
as the ´´Coventry Blitz´´ started.

1419
01:24:41,438 --> 01:24:43,349
And when the bombs started to fall...

1420
01:24:43,438 --> 01:24:45,827
...we stayed at Auntie Vera´s mother´s...

1421
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:47,749
...who had a boarding house.

1422
01:24:48,078 --> 01:24:49,955
All night long...

1423
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,588
...the bombs rained down...

1424
01:24:52,718 --> 01:24:55,835
...and Coventry was a very hot place to be.

1425
01:24:55,998 --> 01:24:58,990
We were in one house
and that was bombed.

1426
01:24:59,078 --> 01:25:02,115
There was a big fire upstairs
and everybody rushed out.

1427
01:25:36,438 --> 01:25:37,917
ln the morning...

1428
01:25:37,998 --> 01:25:40,353
...when Auntie Vera
and Uncle Billy came back...

1429
01:25:40,438 --> 01:25:43,987
...and they saw one of the boarding houses
without any house...

1430
01:25:44,078 --> 01:25:46,148
...just a spiral of a bedstead...

1431
01:25:46,318 --> 01:25:49,469
...they were very shocked,
and they thought we´d been killed.

1432
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:51,788
They rushed over to the other house...

1433
01:25:51,878 --> 01:25:55,268
...and there we were aII drinking tea,
as aIive as anything...

1434
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:58,589
...and that was the onIy time
I saw Auntie Vera cry.

1435
01:25:59,438 --> 01:26:01,827
I think reIief, because...

1436
01:26:01,918 --> 01:26:03,988
...I guess she had a heart after aII.

1437
01:26:08,518 --> 01:26:10,156
Advance. End of Iine.

1438
01:26:11,438 --> 01:26:12,587
March!

1439
01:26:12,758 --> 01:26:14,237
-Jorgensky!
-Here!

1440
01:26:14,318 --> 01:26:15,512
-Tzufevich!
-Here!

1441
01:26:15,598 --> 01:26:16,826
-LeventhaI!
-Here!

1442
01:26:16,918 --> 01:26:17,987
-AIba!
-Here!

1443
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:19,272
-RosenthaI!
-Here!

1444
01:26:19,358 --> 01:26:20,552
-Tozic!
-Here!

1445
01:26:20,638 --> 01:26:22,230
-ToIina!
-Here!

1446
01:26:22,318 --> 01:26:25,037
Yes, they aII have names Iike those.

1447
01:26:25,478 --> 01:26:28,038
This company, which I command...

1448
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:32,231
...is aImost entireIy composed
of German and Austrian anti-fascists.

1449
01:26:33,038 --> 01:26:37,111
It is one of the fifteen aIien companies
in the Pioneer Corps.

1450
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:42,428
The Dunera scandal
and the harsh treatment of refugees...

1451
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:45,948
...began to shift public opinion
in England against internment.

1452
01:26:47,318 --> 01:26:49,752
The government
started releasing internees...

1453
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:52,796
...and allowed them to join
the British armed forces.

1454
01:26:54,598 --> 01:26:57,032
Those who wanted to go back to England...

1455
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,992
...they would send back
under one condition:

1456
01:27:00,558 --> 01:27:01,957
They would join the army.

1457
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,395
l was anxious to get into this.

1458
01:27:05,478 --> 01:27:08,231
First of aII, I hated the Germans.
I hated their guts...

1459
01:27:08,318 --> 01:27:10,115
...and I wanted to be part of it.

1460
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:12,348
Besides,
what was I going to do in AustraIia?

1461
01:27:12,438 --> 01:27:15,077
Sit in AustraIia throughout the whoIe war?
God forbid!

1462
01:27:25,358 --> 01:27:27,314
Girls, this is urgent.

1463
01:27:28,478 --> 01:27:31,072
lf you´re over 1 7-and-a-half and under 19...

1464
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:33,752
...you can volunteer for the ATS.

1465
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:37,468
The sooner you come,
the wider the choice of jobs avaiIabIe.

1466
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:40,512
Come on, girIs, it´s urgent!

1467
01:27:43,118 --> 01:27:44,870
When l was 18...

1468
01:27:45,078 --> 01:27:46,113
...l had...

1469
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:50,396
...to do either work of importance
or join the forces.

1470
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:53,709
l decided to join the forces.

1471
01:27:54,598 --> 01:27:57,237
l also felt l was saying thank you
to England...

1472
01:27:57,318 --> 01:27:58,910
...for saving my life.

1473
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:02,435
I think, as a soIdier, I feIt...

1474
01:28:03,438 --> 01:28:06,111
...suddenIy I was
in an environment where...

1475
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,268
...I was the same as everyone eIse.

1476
01:28:09,838 --> 01:28:12,432
For the first time in my life, l think.

1477
01:28:13,078 --> 01:28:16,309
Because l think in Lincoln, l more or less...

1478
01:28:16,438 --> 01:28:17,951
...think, l existed.

1479
01:28:18,638 --> 01:28:22,836
Because I was waiting for tomorrow,
and tomorrow, and tomorrow.

1480
01:28:24,478 --> 01:28:26,196
l had lots of friends and...

1481
01:28:26,278 --> 01:28:28,508
...l did things l hadn´t done before.

1482
01:28:29,678 --> 01:28:31,908
l felt like everybody else.

1483
01:28:32,878 --> 01:28:36,996
The people on my left, the people
on my right, we were all the same...

1484
01:28:39,998 --> 01:28:43,752
...and that, I think,
was the first time in my Iife...

1485
01:28:43,838 --> 01:28:46,272
...I feIt that I couId do everything...

1486
01:28:46,358 --> 01:28:48,269
...the other peopIe were doing.

1487
01:28:51,038 --> 01:28:54,030
l wanted to do something
to help finish the war.

1488
01:28:54,318 --> 01:28:56,548
l said, ´´l want to go into nursing. ´´

1489
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:59,187
The first year, l nearly gave up.

1490
01:28:59,478 --> 01:29:01,309
l found it very difficult...

1491
01:29:01,798 --> 01:29:04,028
...but I was determined to do it.

1492
01:29:04,758 --> 01:29:07,192
The second year was better.

1493
01:29:07,758 --> 01:29:09,396
Then it grew on me.

1494
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:12,868
We were so busy, I didn´t have time
to think of myseIf, anyhow.

1495
01:29:20,998 --> 01:29:23,796
After about two years
of not hearing from our parents...

1496
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:27,587
...life sort of stretched on endlessly,
but suddenly we heard...

1497
01:29:27,918 --> 01:29:29,556
...that our parents...

1498
01:29:29,638 --> 01:29:31,037
...had reached Spain.

1499
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:35,111
Every night since I Ieft my parents,
I had prayed:

1500
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:38,634
"´PIease, God,
don´t Iet it take Ionger than five years."´

1501
01:29:40,878 --> 01:29:43,028
Five years almost to the day...

1502
01:29:43,278 --> 01:29:45,189
...we got the telegram.

1503
01:29:45,278 --> 01:29:46,836
The telegram said:

1504
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:50,473
´´Arriving Friday, 4:45. ´´

1505
01:29:50,878 --> 01:29:52,197
That was all.

1506
01:29:52,878 --> 01:29:56,712
UnfortunateIy, 4:45 was the train...

1507
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:00,514
...that my schooI friends
were coming back on, as weII.

1508
01:30:01,278 --> 01:30:04,236
I knew that since the whoIe viIIage...

1509
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:07,913
...aIso knew they were coming,
they wouId aII be at the station...

1510
01:30:07,998 --> 01:30:11,149
...and my schooI friends wouId see me...

1511
01:30:11,278 --> 01:30:14,395
...and my brother and sister,
meeting our parents...

1512
01:30:14,798 --> 01:30:17,835
...for the first time in five years.

1513
01:30:20,078 --> 01:30:22,353
It was a tremendous ordeaI.

1514
01:30:22,558 --> 01:30:25,356
We went down to the station to wait.

1515
01:30:25,518 --> 01:30:27,634
And I couIdn´t cope with it.

1516
01:30:27,838 --> 01:30:30,306
So I went back...

1517
01:30:30,398 --> 01:30:31,672
...home and I said:

1518
01:30:31,758 --> 01:30:34,272
"´I´m going home.
I´m going to put the kettIe on.

1519
01:30:34,358 --> 01:30:37,316
"´They´II need a cup of tea."´
How EngIish can you get?

1520
01:30:38,798 --> 01:30:41,028
l waited and waited and waited.

1521
01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:43,154
They took ages.

1522
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,906
SuddenIy, there´s my brother and sister...

1523
01:30:46,318 --> 01:30:49,674
...with this middIe-aged, eIderIy coupIe...

1524
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:53,592
...with suitcases and bags,
coming up the path.

1525
01:30:53,678 --> 01:30:55,908
I remember rushing down to meet them.

1526
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:00,154
l knew they were my parents...

1527
01:31:00,278 --> 01:31:03,315
...but they weren´t
the same parents l´d left.

1528
01:31:03,438 --> 01:31:06,396
They were much older
and they were worn out.

1529
01:31:06,478 --> 01:31:09,595
And we obviously weren´t
the same children...

1530
01:31:09,838 --> 01:31:11,749
...that they´d sent off.

1531
01:31:12,078 --> 01:31:15,787
Suddenly l realized l couldn´t say anything
except their names.

1532
01:31:15,998 --> 01:31:18,387
´´Mommy and Daddy´´ or ´´Mutti and Papa. ´´

1533
01:31:18,798 --> 01:31:20,948
Then we just stood there...

1534
01:31:21,318 --> 01:31:23,468
...Iooking at each other.

1535
01:31:26,678 --> 01:31:28,714
It was such...

1536
01:31:28,838 --> 01:31:30,351
...a traumatic moment.

1537
01:31:30,798 --> 01:31:34,188
It was sad for Inge because
she couIdn´t speak German anymore.

1538
01:31:34,318 --> 01:31:36,957
My brother spoke it with difficuIty.

1539
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,991
I was the onIy one
who couId communicate with them.

1540
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,194
But the barriers compIeteIy went...

1541
01:31:42,718 --> 01:31:45,516
...and we became a family again.

1542
01:31:48,518 --> 01:31:52,067
The cease-fire began yesterday,
to be sounded...

1543
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:53,796
...along all the fronts.

1544
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:58,912
The German war is therefore at an end.

1545
01:32:41,398 --> 01:32:44,151
l remember VE Day very clearly.

1546
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:46,149
lt was just wonderful.

1547
01:32:47,118 --> 01:32:49,871
We all danced in Piccadilly Circus...

1548
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:52,911
...and for me, l just thought, well, this is it:

1549
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:55,507
l´m going to see my parents next week.

1550
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:57,836
I went straight back...

1551
01:32:58,318 --> 01:33:00,752
...and wrote to both of them.

1552
01:33:01,478 --> 01:33:04,754
I wrote separate Ietters
because I had separate addresses...

1553
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:08,234
...through the Red Cross messages
in Theresienstadt.

1554
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:12,229
The letters were returned to me...

1555
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:14,434
...about three or four months later.

1556
01:33:14,638 --> 01:33:16,276
Took a long time.

1557
01:33:17,838 --> 01:33:21,114
All it said on the back was:
´´Deported to Auschwitz...

1558
01:33:21,678 --> 01:33:24,431
´´...October, ´44. ´´

1559
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:28,550
And war was finished in May ´45.

1560
01:33:31,118 --> 01:33:33,109
That´s how I found out.

1561
01:33:35,518 --> 01:33:37,429
As soon as war finished...

1562
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:40,112
...Hella and l went
to the Red Cross Committee...

1563
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:43,349
...and asked them to search.

1564
01:33:43,478 --> 01:33:45,434
Eventually we got a letter from them...

1565
01:33:45,518 --> 01:33:48,988
...saying that my mother
had been killed in Minsk...

1566
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:51,917
...in Russia, where she was deported.

1567
01:33:53,598 --> 01:33:55,475
It´s very hard to come to terms with...

1568
01:33:55,558 --> 01:33:58,311
...when you´ve aIways had that hope.
And, of course, we´ve had...

1569
01:34:00,394 --> 01:34:02,954
...no grave, reaIIy...

1570
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:08,668
...no parting, no end, no funeraI.
It´s that sort of vague feeIing...

1571
01:34:10,823 --> 01:34:15,055
...in the air of hope,
and that hope suddenIy fading.

1572
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:24,016
...in the children´s ward and l was
always joking with them and laughing.

1573
01:34:24,139 --> 01:34:26,573
And l was called to the telephone...

1574
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:29,219
...and there was a telegram for me.

1575
01:34:30,019 --> 01:34:31,930
I asked her if she wouId read it.

1576
01:34:32,019 --> 01:34:34,658
So she read over the teIephone:

1577
01:34:35,579 --> 01:34:38,491
´´Your parents were gravely ill.
There was no hope.

1578
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:40,610
´´Wait for further news. ´´

1579
01:34:42,779 --> 01:34:45,088
I probabIy didn´t quite take it in...

1580
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,773
...so I went back to the ward and started...

1581
01:34:47,899 --> 01:34:52,290
...carried on making beds,
untiI one of the IittIe boys said to me:

1582
01:34:52,419 --> 01:34:54,535
"´Why aren´t you Iaughing this time?"´

1583
01:34:54,619 --> 01:34:57,656
That´s when I burst into tears and ran out.

1584
01:35:00,659 --> 01:35:03,935
l remember going out into the garden
and just lying on the lawn.

1585
01:35:04,019 --> 01:35:06,374
l didn´t want to be with anybody.

1586
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:09,130
lt was such a shock.

1587
01:35:12,739 --> 01:35:16,414
And suddenIy the future,
which we aIways painted...

1588
01:35:16,539 --> 01:35:20,054
...wasn´t there. There was no future.
There was just an emptiness.

1589
01:35:25,779 --> 01:35:28,498
At the time l was liberated, a month later...

1590
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:30,297
...l would have been 20...

1591
01:35:30,379 --> 01:35:34,497
...and l weighed 58 pounds...

1592
01:35:35,499 --> 01:35:39,208
...and that´s after
eight concentration camps.

1593
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:47,855
Many times l thought about it:

1594
01:35:47,939 --> 01:35:50,248
What would have happened if my father...

1595
01:35:50,339 --> 01:35:52,375
...wouldn´t have pulled me out?

1596
01:35:54,619 --> 01:35:57,770
I wouId have never mentioned
it to my father.

1597
01:35:57,859 --> 01:36:00,134
You know, "´Why did you do that?"´

1598
01:36:01,099 --> 01:36:04,455
I think I wouId have done him very wrong.

1599
01:36:04,539 --> 01:36:08,373
And I can fuIIy understand,
being a mother...

1600
01:36:08,979 --> 01:36:11,413
...what it wouId mean if this is...

1601
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:15,014
...what I wouId have had to go through
with my chiId, God forbid.

1602
01:36:16,419 --> 01:36:19,013
My main concern was always:

1603
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:22,410
Let me be strong and let me try...

1604
01:36:22,579 --> 01:36:24,649
...to make it. l made it that far.

1605
01:36:24,939 --> 01:36:26,850
l want to make it to the end.

1606
01:36:27,219 --> 01:36:29,653
Regardless of what the end was.

1607
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:34,095
Survival is an accident.

1608
01:36:35,779 --> 01:36:38,816
You cannot ask a soldier
who comes out of battle:

1609
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:41,493
´´Why were your comrades,
left and right, killed...

1610
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:45,652
´´...and you survived?´´ You have
no explanation for that. lt´s an accident.

1611
01:36:47,339 --> 01:36:49,250
At the moment of liberation...

1612
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:52,657
...we were very happy,
but on the other hand...

1613
01:36:52,779 --> 01:36:55,577
...really very sad, because l realized...

1614
01:36:55,899 --> 01:36:58,333
...that I was one of the Iast
who had survived.

1615
01:36:58,419 --> 01:37:01,775
AII the others who had gone with me
to Auschwitz or had been taken...

1616
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,895
...to Auschwitz wouId never return.

1617
01:37:22,019 --> 01:37:24,135
ln July, 1945...

1618
01:37:24,299 --> 01:37:28,053
...l went back to Germany
to work for the American government.

1619
01:37:28,619 --> 01:37:31,292
One of the reasons
was to look for my parents.

1620
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:36,693
The most sensible place to go to,
would be to go back to Kippenheim.

1621
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:38,458
But l didn´t go back...

1622
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:41,417
...until August, 1947.

1623
01:37:42,699 --> 01:37:44,815
l think on some level...

1624
01:37:45,139 --> 01:37:48,176
...I knew my parents didn´t survive...

1625
01:37:48,499 --> 01:37:51,571
...but as Iong as I didn´t go back
to Kippenheim...

1626
01:37:51,739 --> 01:37:55,209
...I couId stiII say that maybe
they were back in Kippenheim...

1627
01:37:55,299 --> 01:37:58,052
...which doesn´t reaIIy make
a Iot of sense, but...

1628
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:00,778
...I think it was just
my survivaI mechanism.

1629
01:38:02,259 --> 01:38:04,898
l just wasn´t ready yet to accept...

1630
01:38:05,099 --> 01:38:07,329
...the fact that l no longer had parents...

1631
01:38:07,419 --> 01:38:10,456
...that l hadn´t had parents for a long time.

1632
01:38:17,339 --> 01:38:20,456
Although the vast majority
of Kindertransport children...

1633
01:38:20,539 --> 01:38:23,212
...lost their mothers and fathers
in the Holocaust...

1634
01:38:23,299 --> 01:38:24,448
...remarkably...

1635
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:27,895
...a few parents survived
to be reunited with their children.

1636
01:38:31,059 --> 01:38:33,289
My parents managed
to get out of Austria...

1637
01:38:33,379 --> 01:38:35,335
...by going to ltaly.

1638
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:38,496
And from ltaly they got into France.

1639
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:42,572
They were hidden by some extremely
wonderful people there.

1640
01:38:43,419 --> 01:38:44,977
After the war ended...

1641
01:38:45,299 --> 01:38:47,255
...I was toId that my parents...

1642
01:38:47,419 --> 01:38:49,330
...were aIive...

1643
01:38:49,779 --> 01:38:53,818
...and that some day I wouId probabIy
have to go back and Iive with them.

1644
01:38:54,299 --> 01:38:56,529
I think I was horrified by that idea.

1645
01:38:57,539 --> 01:38:59,973
Uncle Percy persuaded my parents...

1646
01:39:00,099 --> 01:39:01,896
...to wait until l´d finished...

1647
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:04,618
...the English School Certificate at age 16.

1648
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:07,771
And also, they needed time
to re-establish themselves.

1649
01:39:10,499 --> 01:39:13,696
Eventually, in 1947,
they were ready for me.

1650
01:39:14,139 --> 01:39:17,654
l didn´t want to go,
but the Cohens took me to Paris...

1651
01:39:17,739 --> 01:39:19,809
...where l was to meet my parents.

1652
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:23,928
I remember standing outside the hoteI.

1653
01:39:25,539 --> 01:39:28,417
I saw, in the distance,
my parents approach.

1654
01:39:29,499 --> 01:39:32,172
I couIdn´t Iook at them directIy.

1655
01:39:32,459 --> 01:39:33,812
So I Iooked at them...

1656
01:39:33,899 --> 01:39:36,208
...their refIection in a shop window...

1657
01:39:36,299 --> 01:39:38,529
...as they waIked towards me. I feIt...

1658
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:40,974
...a very, very strong emotion.

1659
01:39:42,619 --> 01:39:44,655
lt was a sense...

1660
01:39:44,939 --> 01:39:46,452
...of elation...

1661
01:39:46,899 --> 01:39:49,094
...and of love. l suddenly felt it...

1662
01:39:49,179 --> 01:39:50,612
...and fought it.

1663
01:39:50,939 --> 01:39:53,817
But l felt, you know, l knew it was them.

1664
01:39:54,859 --> 01:39:56,053
We met.

1665
01:39:57,499 --> 01:40:01,014
Kurt´s father, who was more demonstrative
than the mother...

1666
01:40:01,219 --> 01:40:03,779
...put his hand through Kurt´s curIs...

1667
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:07,414
...and Kurt went Iike that,
and gave him a waIIop.

1668
01:40:07,619 --> 01:40:10,816
And my husband says,
"´Don´t you ever do that again, Kurt.

1669
01:40:11,499 --> 01:40:14,809
"´Your father is showing you his affection."´

1670
01:40:15,299 --> 01:40:16,732
And that was that.

1671
01:40:29,699 --> 01:40:32,372
When it came to say good-bye
to the Cohens...

1672
01:40:33,139 --> 01:40:36,051
...I reaIized for the first time,
I think, consciousIy...

1673
01:40:36,139 --> 01:40:37,208
...that...

1674
01:40:37,299 --> 01:40:39,494
...they had Ioved me, especiaIIy Percy...

1675
01:40:39,579 --> 01:40:42,491
...because he was in tears,
and I´d never seen him cry...

1676
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:44,649
...I´d never seen him cry before.

1677
01:40:46,259 --> 01:40:48,011
Then we had to Ieave him.

1678
01:40:48,299 --> 01:40:50,255
I remember him Iooking back.

1679
01:40:50,419 --> 01:40:52,649
It was very, very sad.

1680
01:40:57,019 --> 01:40:59,453
He didn´t want to go.
He didn´t know them.

1681
01:41:01,379 --> 01:41:03,768
My parents let go of a 7-year-old...

1682
01:41:03,859 --> 01:41:06,054
...and got back a 16-year-old.

1683
01:41:06,299 --> 01:41:09,416
And my mother especially wanted...

1684
01:41:09,579 --> 01:41:11,729
...to carry on where she´d left off.

1685
01:41:11,979 --> 01:41:15,972
And a 16-year-old doesn´t like
to be treated like a 7-year-old.

1686
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:20,090
So, when we got back to France,
things were very difficult.

1687
01:41:22,259 --> 01:41:24,853
Of course, I´m very Iucky. I reaIize this.

1688
01:41:26,419 --> 01:41:29,456
Most of the Kinder
never saw their parents again.

1689
01:41:29,539 --> 01:41:33,293
I not onIy had mine back,
but another set of parents as weII.

1690
01:41:36,059 --> 01:41:38,050
What more couId one ask for?

1691
01:41:46,579 --> 01:41:49,537
l ceased to be a child
when l boarded the train...

1692
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:50,938
...in Prague.

1693
01:41:56,179 --> 01:41:59,967
lt´s strange that it´s only six years
out of a long life...

1694
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:03,736
...and those six years
wiII affect the rest of your Iife.

1695
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:09,969
l never belonged when l was a child.

1696
01:42:10,059 --> 01:42:12,778
l wanted somewhere to find roots.

1697
01:42:12,979 --> 01:42:14,332
l feel...

1698
01:42:14,539 --> 01:42:18,134
...in the latter years of my life
that l´ve been accepted.

1699
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:21,132
And nobody´s ever said to me:

1700
01:42:21,419 --> 01:42:23,375
"´You weren´t born in this country."´

1701
01:42:23,459 --> 01:42:26,451
I was as entireIy accepted
as everyone eIse.

1702
01:42:27,059 --> 01:42:29,334
And l gradually felt...

1703
01:42:29,659 --> 01:42:31,934
...l had somewhere l belonged.

1704
01:42:35,019 --> 01:42:36,338
To be a refugee...

1705
01:42:36,419 --> 01:42:38,614
...is the most horrible feeling, because...

1706
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:41,008
...you lose your family,
you lose your home...

1707
01:42:41,099 --> 01:42:43,772
...you´re also without an identity.

1708
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:45,537
Suddenly, you´re a nothing.

1709
01:42:45,619 --> 01:42:48,895
You are just reliant on other people´s...

1710
01:42:49,019 --> 01:42:53,092
...good nature, and help,
and understanding.

1711
01:42:53,179 --> 01:42:54,737
That´s why, l think...

1712
01:42:55,099 --> 01:42:57,659
...Iiving in IsraeI,
I feeI for the new immigrants.

1713
01:42:57,739 --> 01:43:00,207
I feeI for the Russians, and the Ethiopians...

1714
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:04,053
...and anybody who´s new,
especiaIIy if they come without famiIies.

1715
01:43:05,339 --> 01:43:07,489
If I can do anything, I do it.

1716
01:43:11,539 --> 01:43:14,611
l am dazzled,
from the point of view of a writer.

1717
01:43:14,779 --> 01:43:16,132
Who else has...

1718
01:43:16,219 --> 01:43:18,892
...the unbelievably good fortune to live...

1719
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:22,131
...with the Jewish manufacturer...

1720
01:43:22,299 --> 01:43:25,450
...the English working-class union man...

1721
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:28,258
...railroad stoker, the milkman...

1722
01:43:28,379 --> 01:43:30,893
...and the Anglo-lndian Victorian ladies?

1723
01:43:31,259 --> 01:43:33,295
Whoever has the sheer...

1724
01:43:34,654 --> 01:43:38,169
...advantage of not studying this
from the outside...

1725
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:43,039
...but being a heIpIess member
from the inside of these famiIies?

1726
01:43:45,870 --> 01:43:47,223
Seems to me...

1727
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,663
...it was a gift.

1728
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:49,865
Didn´t seem so at the time.

1729
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:54,623
l now look at...

1730
01:43:56,025 --> 01:43:57,902
...my 14-year-old grandson...

1731
01:43:58,265 --> 01:44:01,143
...and l think, ´´This is the age when l lost...

1732
01:44:01,305 --> 01:44:04,502
´´...parents, home, country. ´´

1733
01:44:06,585 --> 01:44:09,053
A lot has been made up to me...

1734
01:44:09,545 --> 01:44:11,695
...from where l lost out.

1735
01:44:12,025 --> 01:44:14,585
l have a second cousin here.

1736
01:44:15,105 --> 01:44:17,858
He says "´Anything you haven´t had,
you´ve got now."´

1737
01:44:17,945 --> 01:44:19,378
Which is so true.

1738
01:44:19,545 --> 01:44:24,175
And I´m very gratefuI
and very proud of the whoIe famiIy.

1739
01:44:27,865 --> 01:44:31,460
The younger you were, the more
unforgiving you are of your parents.

1740
01:44:31,545 --> 01:44:33,775
You may say they were so brave
and saved you...

1741
01:44:33,865 --> 01:44:36,174
...but they really abandoned you.

1742
01:44:37,225 --> 01:44:39,898
We were four friends, very close friends.

1743
01:44:39,985 --> 01:44:41,498
We all agreed:

1744
01:44:41,945 --> 01:44:43,822
"´If it ever happens again...

1745
01:44:43,905 --> 01:44:46,703
"´...we wiII not send away our chiIdren.
We wiII stay...

1746
01:44:46,785 --> 01:44:48,343
"´...and die together."´

1747
01:44:48,585 --> 01:44:50,143
That´s what we said.

1748
01:44:52,345 --> 01:44:54,575
Later on, as we grew oIder, we said...

1749
01:44:54,665 --> 01:44:56,496
...we mitigated it, we said:

1750
01:44:56,705 --> 01:45:00,015
"´If it ever happens, we promise to take
each other´s chiIdren in.

1751
01:45:00,105 --> 01:45:02,619
"´We wiII not send them to strangers."´

1752
01:45:06,585 --> 01:45:09,019
l certainly do my share of remembering...

1753
01:45:09,145 --> 01:45:11,181
...but remembering also has to have...

1754
01:45:11,265 --> 01:45:13,495
...a present and future perspective.

1755
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:18,022
You can´t just stop at remembering.

1756
01:45:21,025 --> 01:45:25,064
l don´t think l ever made
a conscious decision to devote myself...

1757
01:45:25,265 --> 01:45:28,735
...to human rights and social justice issues.

1758
01:45:29,785 --> 01:45:31,662
Someone helped me.

1759
01:45:31,985 --> 01:45:33,782
l can´t pay back...

1760
01:45:33,865 --> 01:45:36,459
...or thank some of the people
who helped me...

1761
01:45:36,625 --> 01:45:40,504
...but l can do something for other people.

1762
01:46:10,505 --> 01:46:13,065
l´ve come to a conclusion about myself:

1763
01:46:14,225 --> 01:46:17,023
ln 1938 l escaped...

1764
01:46:17,145 --> 01:46:19,500
...the deportation of Poland.

1765
01:46:19,585 --> 01:46:22,418
l got out of Germany
in the Kindertransport.

1766
01:46:22,745 --> 01:46:24,463
l was sent to Australia on a ship.

1767
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:27,059
The ship was torpedoed
and nothing happened.

1768
01:46:27,785 --> 01:46:30,219
l got back to England and was in the army.

1769
01:46:30,305 --> 01:46:32,375
Why all these coincidences?

1770
01:46:32,705 --> 01:46:36,015
I´ve come to one concIusion:
I was meant to survive.

1771
01:46:36,505 --> 01:46:39,065
Not because of myseIf...

1772
01:46:39,425 --> 01:46:41,620
...but because the Jews were to survive.

1773
01:46:41,705 --> 01:46:44,094
And I wouId bring up another generation.

1774
01:46:44,465 --> 01:46:47,104
And they wouId Iive.
I Iook at my chiIdren...

1775
01:46:47,345 --> 01:46:49,336
...and my grandchiIdren, and I know...

1776
01:46:49,425 --> 01:46:51,780
...there was a purpose to my Iife.
