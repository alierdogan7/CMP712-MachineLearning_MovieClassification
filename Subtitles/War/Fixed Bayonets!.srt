Hey, did you hear
what happened?

4
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,323
The general went up in the line companies.
A shell got his jeep.

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,426
He's in the C.P.
getting patched up.

6
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,802
I had a general like that in the last war,
General McNair. Remember him?

Top brass is supposed to

9
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,339
They got too much responsibility taking
chances getting their tails shot off.

10
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,678
When you've been in this outfit
a little longer, Buster...

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,014

All right, we've been
ordered to withdraw.

32
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,449
The boys upstairs want the whole division
pulled back right away.

33
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,419
What do you think our chances
are of ever getting back to this area?

34
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,320
It'll be rough, sir.
It means getting across this river.

35
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,257
There's a bridge right there at
that point. It's the only exit open.

36
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,491
Then we got to get to that bridge, cross
it and blow it up to give us a breather.

37
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,159
Once we're reinforced, we'll come back and
hit 'em like they've never been hit before.

38
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,795
John, how's the enemy
picture look?

39
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,465
Very strong, General.
If I were the enemy...

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:06,205
and became aware of your withdrawal from
here to there, I'd start a full-scale attack.

41
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,770
The Reds have got
two armored divisions here...

42
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,875
a field division here and elements
of a regiment behind this hill.

43
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,444
Now, once we start moving
along this road to the river...

44
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,822
the Reds are going to form an iron triangle
that'll trap us and smash us in the gut...

45
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,020
unless they didn't know
we were withdrawing.

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,065
Well, in that case...

47
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,727
we'll have to withdraw without the Reds
knowing about it.

48
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,794
You should be evacuated, sir.
You're liable to lose your arm.

49
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,706
I'm more worried about losing my division.
Now clean it, dress it, tape it and forget it.

50
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,971
Will you hold that, sir?

51
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,243
There's only one way we can pull this off.
That's rearguard action.

52
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,551
We'll have to put up a front
and fool them.

53
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,558
We'll have to make them think
our rearguard is not a delaying action...

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,186
but a forward outpost
to this division's bivouac.

55
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,096
General, the spot is there.
Now, I looked over this terrain yesterday.

56
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,657
The hills are steep
on both sides of this pass...

57
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,193
and the road narrows down so that
only one tank at a time can get through.

58
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,400
All right, if we move down
that road, around that bend...

59
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,909
and set up a roadblock
right here at Bayonet Pass...

60
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,845
we stand a chance.

61
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,781
I suggest we leave
a full regiment to hold the pass...

62
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,411
so the enemy won't suspect that
we're pulling back the division.

63
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,752
Yes, but what happens to the regiment
after the division is across the river?

64
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,783
That might be just as costly for a regi ment
to try to pull back as a division.

65
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,852
We can do it with
a battalion or a company.

66
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,696
It should be a small, specially selected
unit of platoon strength.

67
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,430
Forty-eight of our toughest,
most experienced combat men.

68
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,904
It would mean sacrificing
less men in a gamble...

69
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,908
and an easier withdrawal
for the group if successful.

70
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,967
In other words,
what you're saying is...

71
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,776
if we can make a platoon sound
and look like a regiment, it'll work.

72
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,215
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,457
Well, that's it. Order the division
to move out right away.

Nope. No time.
Get them on the road.

83
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,995

to get their bayonets wet.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,728

but it's got to be picked.

than a rearguard action...

especially at
platoon strength.

89
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,386
But in this case, it's 48 men-
unlucky men, maybe-

90

What is this rearguard?

118
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,439
The object of the rearguard is to
check enemy pursuit and harassment...

119

00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,204
Hey, you guys.
Okay up there?

325
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:47,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:51,680
They told me this was
going to be a police action.

327
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:54,223
- Why didn't they send cops?
- Hmm.

328
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,350
- Sarge.
- Hmm?

329
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:58,917
I've been watching you, Sarge.
I've been watching you out there...

330
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:01,862
and you came close to stepping in
some of the land mines.

331
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,764
- Ah, come on, Fitz. Will you cut out worrying?
- I mean it, Sarge.

332
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:08,930
You know, I got used to Lieutenant Gibbs,
and he got it just like that.

333
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:11,098
So?

334
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:15,270
Well, I feel like I'm a bad luck piece
'cause I'm getting kind of used to you.

335
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,977
[Coughing]

336
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,545
All right,
kill that fire!

337
00:30:25,622 --> 00:30:29,058
- I thought the smoke would go down that drop.
- I cook the hot chow.

338
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,559
- I just want to get some heat.
- Well, kill it!

339
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:34,096
Bunch up. Heat will
come from your bodies.

340
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,629
Hey, Wolowicz,
did you find Lemchek?

341
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:46,643
Yeah. You were right, Corporal.
He was on the 30.

342
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,144
- He's had it.
- Yeah. What about my helmet?

343
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:51,612
Oh, I couldn't find yours.

344
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,644
Hey, how come we weren't
issued those stoves?

345
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,745
You're too young
for this kind of luxury.

346
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,620
- You looted that in Germany, didn't you, Rock?
- Yep. Aachen.

347
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,888
- Hey, Sarge, you know the fellow you got?
- Yeah. Which one?

348
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:07,088
The one that got
Lieutenant Gibbs.

349
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,154
A funny thing
about that joker.

350
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,496
When I stuck him,
he made a booming sound.

351
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:15,971
- Yeah, like a bass drum.
- Yeah. How'd you know?

352
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,599
Well, I heard it.

353
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:23,476
- What about him, Wolowicz?
- He had an extra pair of shoes on him...

354
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,946
just like my old
bowling sneakers.

355
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:29,507
- Let's see.
- Wolowicz, did he have any dry socks on him?

356
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,350
- [Wolowicz] No.
- I never could figure them Chinese.

357
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:37,189
Well, you know what I heard? I heard they're
doped up before they're sent into charges.

358
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,957
Oh, it isn't a question of opiates.
Now as a student of atavism-

359
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:46,366
What a crock! Mr. Belvedere
knows everything. Ha! I need a fumigator.

360
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:48,768
You've been around
a lot, Whitey.

361
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:53,244
When you get out, are you going on another
safari to Africa in your private plane?

362
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:58,110
No. All I want to do
is roll a couple of lines.

363
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,878
You mean, you like to bowl?

364
00:32:00,951 --> 00:32:05,479
Wolowicz, there's nothing like
the thrill of a good, clean strike.

365
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:09,117
Good, clean strike. Instead of pulling that
dope's leg, why don't you drop dead, Whitey.

366
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:14,153
- Give your mouth a 10-minute break.
- Is that an order, Corporal?

367
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:17,132
-If you're looking for a fight,
there's a lot of people outside.
-Let's go.

368
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,396
- Who's gonna follow who?
- Meaning what?

369
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,167
-Whatever you think it means, Corporal.
-I think I'll slap your ears in.

370
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,504
There they are.

371
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:29,672
You bucking for his stripes? You want him
to get busted for taking a poke at you?

372
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,841
'Cause if he does, I didn't see a thing.
I'm snow-blind.

373
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:37,478
What's the matter with you, Mainotes?
We've got a good cover here. Ain't you happy?

374
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:39,988
I just don't
like that guy.

375
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,185
Well, then why don't you
get a transfer?

376
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,251
They got the buddy system now.

377
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:48,321
If you got a buddy, they'll put you
both together in the same outfit.

378
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,560
I got a buddy
in Pittsburgh.

379
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:55,196
Ah, she's a blonde and operates
her own pool hall.

380
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,740
Tell me, Sarge, whywere we picked
for this job?

381
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,902
Regiment's saving the cream
for the rougher stuff ahead.

382
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:04,436
Cream? Well, what are we,
skimmed milk?

383
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,076
So far,
we've just been lucky.

384
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,178
They blew them horns
to make us jumpy.

385
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:15,248
They knocked us off the hill
to see if we'd answer back with artillery.

386
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:19,262
They shellacked the pass
hoping we'd start a rout.

387
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,925
But we're still in luck.
Know why?

388
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,594
'Cause they think
we're the whole regiment.

389
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,728
So far, we got them fooled.

390
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,536
I wonder how long it'll be
before they get wise to us.

391
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:35,942
When you hear a tank, that's the main
event. That means they're wise to us.

392
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,540
A tank means they'll hit us with
more tanks and a lot ofpeople.

393
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:44,383
A tank means they'll push through us
like we were a paper bag.

394
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,787
So until you hear one,
take it easy.

395
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,220
We'll each take
two hours on O.P.

396
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,424
When I come off, it'll be time
to pull out for the bridge.

397
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:58,434
- Who's relieving Ramirez?
- Denno.

398
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:00,561
Ha. So you're putting
the corporal to work, huh?

399
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:05,506
Corporal's got to be able to do
something besides draw extra pay.

400
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,841
How did you get those stripes, Denno?
Dog rob for the colonel?

401
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:39,432
Only three things you got to worry about
in the infantry-your rifle and your two feet.

402
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,674
Pull off your boots and your socks.
Both pairs.

403
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,477
Come on. Bunch your canal boats
together like bananas.

404
00:34:49,553 --> 00:34:52,181
Massaging's good
for beetle crushers.

405
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,315
Yours is purple, Denno.

406
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:58,327
Next, it'll be blue,
then trench foot, then frostbite.

407
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,831
Then they got to be chopped,
all 10 of them.

408
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,232
Ah, you've got to rub
harder than that. Here.

409
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:09,136
All we've got to worry about's where the Reds
are gonna hit us from in the morning.

410
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:12,733
If we can draw their fire without
losing a guy to locate their guns...

411
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,903
that's using our noodle.

412
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,578
- How's that?
- I don't feel anything.

413
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,742
Oh, yeah?

414
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:24,351
- Feel that?
- No.

415
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:26,480
Hey, Doc, come here.

416
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,255
Take a look
at Denno's foot.

417
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,833
You got it bad,
Corporal.

418
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:42,235
Hey.

419
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,367
Hey, you better start
stomping around on that, Denno.

420
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,741
Get the blood circulating.

421
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,644
Ah, that one always
did go to sleep on me.

422
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,122
Let's hit the sack.

423
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,161
[ Snoring ]

424
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:39,313
[ Snorts ]
Hmm? Hmm?

425
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,880
- Hey, Rock.
- Huh?

426
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,359
Whatever made you
stay in the army?

427
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,825
You woke me up
just to ask me that?

428
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,098
Well, I've been meaning to ask you,
but I just never got the chance.

429
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:59,438
Get some shut-eye before those
people start hitting us again.

430
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:07,316
- You want to gab, huh?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:12,048
That's something I been trying
figure out myself for a long, long time.

432
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:15,888
What makes a guy
stay in the army?

433
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,156
I wish I knew the answer.

434
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:22,096
Some of us 'cause
we're dumb, I guess.

435
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,599
Some are poor.

436
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,501
Some are a little lazy.

437
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,838
Some of us got some vanity.
Know what I mean?

438
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,968
Yeah.

439
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,375
Some of us old pros stay in even when we
know that after the fighting's over...

440
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,250
some of us will rest in peace
and rot in hospitals.

441
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:48,348
Even when we know all that,
we stay in 'cause-

442
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:52,418
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

443
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,624
Maybe it's something
that just happens to you.

444
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,724
[ Chuckles ]
Maybe it's the pension.

445
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:00,201
[ Chuckles ]

446
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,534
I wish I knew the answer.

447
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:09,639
- I don't want to be a corporal. I want to get busted.
- You what?

448
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,442
I always wanted to lead.

449
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,816
When I was in officers' school,
I was head of the class.

450
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,653
They said I had the makings of a leader-
the education, the brains...

451
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,818
the knack of solving
tactical situations.

452
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:27,261
And one day, we had a problem with
live shells. We had to knock out a tank.

453
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,061
There was a red flag there warning
not to send any men in that area.

454
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:33,534
I was in command
of the platoon.

455
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:37,433
I don't know
what happened, Rock.

456
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:40,772
The minute that stuff started flying through
the air and I had to deploy my squad...

457
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,143
something happened
right in the pit of my gut.

458
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:47,980
I got panicky and I sent a squad
to the danger zone.

459
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,246
Four men were hit,
one seriously.

460
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,153
I was there when
they amputated his leg.

461
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:58,286
They gave me another chance. Again I got
into a sweat the minute I had to give orders.

462
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:02,195
Then they found out
what I'd known all the time.

463
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:04,790
I can take an order.

464
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:07,769
I can't give one.

465
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,639
Hmm. Some men are afraid of high places,
some are afraid of water...

466
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:17,703
and some are afraid to be responsible
for the deaths of a lot of other guys.

467
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:20,807
That's me, Rock.

468
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,875
I don't want to
carry that load.

469
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:27,481
Yeah. Well, a lot of guys
sweat out leading an outfit.

470
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:31,391
I mean, nobody goes out
looking for responsibility.

471
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:34,191
Sometimes you find it whether
you're looking for it or not.

472
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:38,064
But I'm not looking for it.
It takes brains to be a leader.

473
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,535
I'm just smart enough
not to want any part ofit.

474
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,903
Even a two-striper like you,
you'll find out.

475
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,135
It takes more than brains
to be a corporal.

476
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:49,372
You got to have
the guts to lead.

477
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,914
Look, I'll do my job.

478
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:56,009
It's just... I don't want to
lead, that's all.

479
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,554
Hey, take it easy.
I ain't promoting you.

480
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,921
Lonergan and me,
we'll be around for a long time.

481
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:05,655
Ain't no burp gun fast enough
to cut down an old doggy like me.

482
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:10,428
If anything happened to you,

All right. Here. Let's see you
knock down one pin.

With this guy, I think we better
set 'em up in the gutter.

- Yeah, to make sure that he hits.
- Don't forget to let go of the ball.

- Oh, what a guy.
- Send him back to the kitchen.

01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:28,680
- He's a rush a lineJoe.
- You bowl just like you shoot. That's lousy.

- How about those people, tried to get through?
- There's lots of them there...

Send up Bigmouth, Zablocki,
Griff and Bulchek from the third squad.

668
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:46,582
That means they'll probe
every area with mortar.

- How do you figure that?
- Well, they just scouted with mortar, didn't they?

670
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:55,962
Or did they send out people first?
It means they got plenty of mortars.

That was smart drawing fire
with guys made out of snow.

- Yeah, you build a good snowman, Jonesy.

You'd care too, Mainotes, if you
had a reason for coming out of this.

You've got to get over

There's eight bullets in that clip.
That means eight dead Reds.

I ain't asking you to
use a clip to kill eight men.

to the ground and hear the enemy...

- he can smell a Red a mile away.
- I guess some guys are born with it.

No, it's a mixture
of training and instinct.

- I used to have a nose for winners at the track.
- What time is it?

after 7:00.

trying to knock off that top ledge.

And then they'll drop one
on the lower ledge...

and hope that the fragments
get us inside.
