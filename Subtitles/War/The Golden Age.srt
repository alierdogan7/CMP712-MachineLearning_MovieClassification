1
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,365
Why do you go
among the people, Majesty?

2
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,868
I tell you plainly,
you will be murdered.

3
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,701
Every Catholic in England
is a potential assassin!

4
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,173
Be warned
by the atrocities in France.

5
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,143
We know the Catholics
take their orders
from Spain.

6
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,079
The Spanish speak
openly of Mary Stuart

7
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,048
as Queen of England
in waiting.

8
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,141
Their loyalty is to
the Pope in Rome!

9
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,347
How many Catholics
are there in England, sir?

10
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,912
Immense numbers,
Majesty.

11
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,188
Half the nation
cling to the old
superstitions.

12
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,626
What would you have me do?

13
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,599
Hang half the people
of England
or just imprison them?

14
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,101
We must act, Majesty.

15
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,003
Our inaction
is perceived
as weakness.

16
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,575
If my people break the law,
they shall be punished.

17
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,941
Until that day,
they shall be protected.

18
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,504
Majesty, we have
proven reason to fear
every Catholic in the...

19
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,574
Fear creates fear.

20
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,679
I am not ignorant
of the dangers, sir.

21
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,453
But I will not
punish my people
for their beliefs.

22
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,824
Only for their deeds.

23
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,456
I am assured
that the people of England
love their Queen.

24
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,397
My constant endeavor
is to earn that love.

25
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,655
My Queen.

26
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,981
Our friends write
to give us hope.

27
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,577
Soon England's
true believers will rise up

28
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,282
against the bastard
usurper Elizabeth

29
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,120
and slit her throat.

30
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,819
That's enough!

31
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,729
Slit her throat? Please.

32
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,931
And when that bastard
usurper is dead,
my lady will be queen.

33
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:48,539
Your bishops are preaching
that God is showing
his displeasure

34
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,809
because the Queen
is still unmarried,

35
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,317
some rudely
suggesting infertile.

36
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,478
What nonsense.

37
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,580
Dangerous nonsense.

38
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,251
Mary Stuart has a son.

39
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,489
Why does everyone
torment me with Mary Stuart?

40
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,861
It's not her fault
she's next in line
to the throne.

41
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,921
Don't hide your face.

42
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,591
So long as you
have no issue.

43
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,101
If you were
to produce an heir,

44
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,034
there'd be no more talk
of Mary, Queen of Scots.

45
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,563
I've heard it's customary
to obtain a husband
before producing an heir.

46
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,640
We shall have to hunt
out a husband
for you soon, Bess.

47
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,043
Not too soon,
my lady.

48
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,638
There are husbands
to be had.

49
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,114
You don't want
to be married?

50
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,582
I'll want to be married
if I want the man...

51
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,278
Austria. France.

52
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,322
Turkey. Turkey has a sultan.
China has an emperor.

53
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,858
I confine myself
to the possible.

54
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,587
That's where you and I
differ, Walsingham.

55
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,494
I find the impossible
far more interesting.

56
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,196
What kind of man
would you want?

57
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,238
An honest man
with friendly eyes.

58
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,739
And good legs.
And sweet breath.

59
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,003
So you can kiss him
without choking.

60
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,177
There must be
any amount of princes

61
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,649
in the undiscovered lands
across the sea.

62
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,083
Find me an honest one
of those.

63
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,072
Since when do we discuss
private matters
in public spaces?

64
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,269
I ask Your Majesty's
forgiveness.

65
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,610
Have my doctors
confirm that the Queen
is still fertile.

66
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,481
The people need
to be reassured.

67
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,575
I care
for your safety.

68
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,950
The threats to your
person are real.

69
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,579
You know very well
if I fall,

70
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,648
you'll all come
tumbling down after me.

71
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,818
The sea wall at Dover
is cracking, Francis.

72
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:45,022
We have no money
to rebuild our defenses.

73
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,497
Turn your mind
to that threat.

74
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,250
May we have wisdom
not to fear shadows
in the night.

75
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,883
And courage when the day
of danger truly dawns.

76
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,191
My time has come,
Majesty.

77
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,661
Send me back to England
to begin God's work.

78
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,122
Your Majesty.

79
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,770
Guards!
Take hold of him!

80
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,714
A puddle in the way,

81
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,747
Majesty.

82
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,819
A puddle.

83
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,275
Puddle.

84
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,313
You'll have to see
the Lord Chamberlain, sir.

85
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,619
Which one is he?

86
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,489
He's over there.

87
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,255
You can't come in.

88
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,831
So how am I to see him
if you won't let me through?

89
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,957
You must wait for him
to come out.

90
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,023
And when will he
come out?

91
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,262
There's no way
of knowing that.

92
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,897
I had less trouble
than this boarding
a Spanish ship.

93
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:47,105
What if enemy ships
should sail up the Thames,
can the docks be closed?

94
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,306
Not closed, Majesty.
But the gun positions...

95
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,077
Spanish...

96
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,449
Ambassador.

97
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,593
King Eric of Sweden,
Majesty.

98
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,958
Not again.

99
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,121
Still madly in love with you.

100
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,288
Still mad, you mean.

101
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,424
Lvan, Tsar
of all the Russias.

102
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,968
Where's Bess?

103
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,129
Known as
"lvan the Terrible," Majesty.

104
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,473
Late.

105
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,845
I beg
Your Majesty's forgiveness.

106
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,048
Given.

107
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,020
Once.

108
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,218
The Archduke
Charles of Austria, Majesty.

109
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,824
The puddle man
is outside, Majesty.

110
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,026
My suitors.

111
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,628
Younger brother
to Maximilian II,
Holy Roman Emperor.

112
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,230
Cousin of Philip of Spain.
Wealthy.

113
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,935
He's rather handsome.

114
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,403
How old is he?

115
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,948
Young,
I believe, Majesty.

116
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,715
An Austrian alliance
would keep France quiet.

117
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,084
And put Philip on a leash.

118
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,089
I've become
almost enthusiastic.

119
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,090
Send for him.

120
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>Danke schön.</i>

121
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,189
How much longer
do you think I can play
this game, Francis?

122
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,293
Virginity is an asset
that holds its value well.

123
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,304
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.

124
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,369
Your Majesty, this man
is a notorious pirate.

125
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:30,313
Spanish gold stolen
from Spanish ships,
attacked without provocation.

126
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,748
Well, sir, what do you want?

127
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,986
I have just returned
from the New World, Majesty.

128
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,688
I have claimed
the fertile coast
in your name

129
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,493
and called it Virginia

130
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,999
in honor
of our Virgin Queen.

131
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,899
Virginia?

132
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,736
And when I marry,
will you change
the name to Conjugia?

133
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,872
I ask your gracious
permission, Majesty,

134
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,639
to return to the New World
with your royal warrant

135
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,682
to found a colony
under the laws
and protections of England.

136
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,011
He wants money.

137
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,348
Who are they?

138
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,819
Natives of the
Americas, Majesty.

139
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,321
Have they no ruler
of their own?

140
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,192
None to match
England's Queen.

141
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,754
These gentlemen
are welcome.

142
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,663
See that they
are treated well.

143
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,725
I also come
bearing gifts
for Your Majesty.

144
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:28,365
These gifts, Majesty,
are the fruits of piracy,

145
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,704
the true property
of the realm of Spain.

146
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,337
Let's see, shall we?
What have you brought me?

147
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,789
<i>Patata, Majesty.</i>

148
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,918
You eat it.
Very nourishing.

149
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,673
Tobacco.

150
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,009
You breathe its smoke.

151
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,215
Very stimulating.

152
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,300
Gold.

153
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,665
Courtesy of a Spanish ship
that found itself unable
to complete its journey.

154
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,799
Forgive me, Majesty.

155
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,607
I find the air
has become stale.

156
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,206
I am sensitive
to the smell
of open sewers.

157
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:55,326
I cannot accept
the fruits of piracy,
Mr. Raleigh.

158
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,194
Philip of Spain is no friend
of England, Majesty.

159
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,634
The more gold I take from him,
the safer you will be.

160
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,227
Well, well.

161
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,239
A political pirate.

162
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,209
And Your Majesty's
most loyal subject.

163
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:16,379
Welcome home, Mr. Raleigh.
Lord Howard, the docks.

164
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,242
Master Raleigh.

165
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,421
You eat it...

166
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,306
You traitor!

167
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,277
Judas!

168
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,909
You're Walsingham's pawn!

169
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,752
Don't do this!
I didn't say anything!

170
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,421
You're a
Protestant traitor!

171
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,989
Don't do it! Don't!

172
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,368
Don't!
Hold his head!

173
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,967
You Judas! You Judas!
Stop!

174
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,375
You Judas!

175
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,373
The traitor's dead.
We must act!

176
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,283
Why do we not strike?
What are we waiting for?

177
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,413
You wait for my order.

178
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:12,326
Walsingham knows
too much already.
One traitor is dead.

179
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,101
Who can I trust now?

180
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,775
There's a visitor
waiting, sir.

181
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,814
William.

182
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,855
Hello, Francis.

183
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,414
You've always
been a fellow who
delighted in surprises.

184
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,392
You look well,
Francis.

185
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,487
Well, you look dreadful.
They're not feeding
you in Paris.

186
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,034
You can't learn
the secrets of the universe
on an empty stomach.

187
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:54,370
<i>Then she my heart beguiled</i>

188
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,900
Mary. William.
Supper is ready.

189
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,475
William.

190
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,038
Have you spoken
to the Queen?

191
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,242
I speak
with the Queen daily.

192
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,251
You work too hard.
You're a sick man.

193
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,946
William,
come over here
and sit by me.

194
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,420
William, if we are not
allowed to sin,

195
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,683
maybe we could
talk theology.

196
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,658
You have done enough.
No man could do more.

197
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,956
I can't leave
the court yet, Ursula.
She needs me.

198
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,724
Never listens to me.
Not a thought for his health.

199
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,196
So you talk to him,
he's your brother.

200
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:24,167
William, what do they say
in Paris about the Pope's
call for holy war?

201
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,260
Many welcome it.

202
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,066
Why must we talk
about war?

203
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,334
Tell us your nice
news, William.

204
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,535
Are you married yet?
Not yet.

205
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,874
Mary, would you leave
William alone, please?

206
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,710
Sweet, sit.

207
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,243
Grace?

208
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,443
Oh, Lord,
provider of all things,

209
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,512
we offer Thee
our humble thanks.

210
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,491
In the name
of the Holy Trinity, amen.

211
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,685
Amen.

212
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,563
More lines on my face.

213
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,935
Where do they come from?

214
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,137
Smile lines, my lady.

215
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,510
Smile lines?

216
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,379
When do I ever smile?

217
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,018
Now you have
smile lines, too.

218
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:30,201
<i>The beauty of Your Majesty</i>

219
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,638
<i>is dazzling to my eyes.</i>

220
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,977
I am overwhelmed.

221
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,487
I am conquered.

222
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,115
I die.

223
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,217
Only your love,

224
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,922
<i>my stattlich Elizabeth,</i>

225
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,123
can restore me into life.

226
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,326
Your Highness
does me great honor.

227
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,173
Oh, Elizabeth.

228
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:20,750
How blessed am I
to stand in your
fabled presence.

229
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,545
Ah, Elizabeth.

230
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,887
To speak your name
is to hear celestial music.

231
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,188
May that sweet sound

232
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:38,066
guide me through my life
to come, Elizabeth.

233
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:43,968
I have traveled here
to this illustrious court

234
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:48,112
in the hope that
our two great nations

235
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,814
might be
joined in love.

236
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,829
He interests me.

237
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,161
Talk to him.

238
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,434
Him, my lady?

239
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,667
Him.

240
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,312
I adore the natives
you brought. I don't suppose
you could get one for me.

241
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,817
They're not
dangerous, are they?

242
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,716
That depends
on what you propose
to do with them.

243
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,255
I'd dress him up
in mulberry
colored silk,

244
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,258
and have him walk
behind me,
carrying my cloak.

245
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,834
I have a secret,
my dear.

246
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,300
I pretend there's
a pane of glass,

247
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:53,333
<i>eine Glasscheibe
between me and them.</i>

248
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,875
They can see me,
but they cannot touch me.

249
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,113
You should try it.

250
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,051
Majesty, I am...

251
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,001
It is something,
after all,

252
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:25,510
to take a blank on the map
and build there
a shining city.

253
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,138
Which you will no doubt
name after yourself.

254
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,681
No doubt.

255
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,088
May I ask
a question in return?

256
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,182
Of course.

257
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,523
How am I to win
the Queen's favor?

258
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,062
Why should I tell you that?

259
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,463
I've little enough to offer,
but whatever I have to give,

260
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,495
ask, and it's yours.

261
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,005
Say what you mean to say
as plainly as possible.

262
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,406
All men flatter the Queen
in hope of advancement.

263
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,184
Pay her the compliment
of truth.

264
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,083
I don't even know
your name.

265
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,745
Elizabeth Throckmorton.

266
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,790
A second
Elizabeth?

267
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,088
Everyone calls me Bess.

268
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,154
Your most serene Majesty,
bright star of our firmament,

269
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:25,135
we present our humble masque
of the heavenly spheres.

270
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,865
His Highness is tired
after his long journey.

271
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,002
No man
can become tired

272
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,947
in the presence of
so lovely a queen.

273
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:15,748
His Highness, the Archduke
informs me that my charms
overwhelm him.

274
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:19,587
He will retire
to his private chambers
to rest.

275
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,233
I don't want him hurt
by your schemes.

276
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,897
So how should
we proceed?

277
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,202
Perhaps we should
all retire.

278
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:43,041
I suspect him of being
a professional charmer.

279
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,274
Am I right?

280
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,284
He is certainly
charming, my lady.

281
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,755
Well, there are
duller professions.

282
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,788
You like him, don't you?

283
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,350
He's a man
that lives in a world
far beyond the court.

284
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,531
It's refreshing.

285
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,362
Well.

286
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,561
We shall let him
come again.

287
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,929
Blue.

288
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,141
<i>Can you imagine
what it is to cross an ocean?</i>

289
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:22,181
For weeks, you see nothing
but the horizon,
perfect and empty.

290
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,757
You live in the grip of fear.

291
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,582
Fear of storms.

292
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,128
Fear of sickness on board.

293
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,691
Fear of the immensity.

294
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,304
So you must drive
that fear down deep
into your belly.

295
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,406
Study your charts.

296
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,075
Watch your compass.

297
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,938
Pray for a fair wind.

298
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,513
And hope,

299
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:54,845
pure,

300
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,987
naked,

301
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,385
fragile

302
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,323
hope.

303
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,030
Majesty, the Archduke
and court are waiting.

304
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,998
Let them wait.

305
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,527
Go on, Mr. Raleigh.

306
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,665
You were hoping.

307
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:20,342
At first,
it's no more than
a haze on the horizon.

308
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,584
So you watch.

309
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,251
You watch.

310
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,687
Then it's a smudge,

311
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,501
a shadow on the far water.

312
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,501
For a day.

313
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,339
For another day.

314
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:56,839
The stain slowly spreads
along the horizon taking form,

315
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:03,052
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

316
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,419
You dare to whisper
the word.

317
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,454
Land.

318
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,630
Land.

319
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,890
Life.

320
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,061
Resurrection.

321
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,734
The true adventure.

322
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,568
Coming out of
the vast unknown,

323
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,841
out of the immensity,

324
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,247
into new life.

325
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,418
That,

326
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,649
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

327
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:55,104
I like
your immensities.

328
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:01,510
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

329
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,039
Such great spaces
make us small.

330
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,917
Do we discover
the New World,
Mr. Raleigh,

331
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,480
or does the New World
discover us?

332
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,391
You speak like
a true explorer.

333
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,897
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

334
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,201
And I like you.

335
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,806
You know, of course,
that when I like a man,
I reward him.

336
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,147
I have heard that.

337
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,117
And what have you
to say about it?

338
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,554
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

339
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,921
Is the mission
not the man?

340
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,927
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

341
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,797
Go on.

342
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,706
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

343
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,677
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

344
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,077
Now you grow dull.

345
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,658
Come on!

346
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,111
Mine.

347
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,849
You have
the stronger horse.

348
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,790
Yours carries
the lighter load.

349
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,293
No.

350
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,994
The Queen does not
give way to others.

351
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,263
Whoa! Whoa!

352
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:48,177
Forgive me, Majesty.
My horse doesn't seem
to know his place yet.

353
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,917
Have you ever
known your place,
Mr. Raleigh?

354
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,955
Oh, come on!

355
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,113
It's from her.

356
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,754
Mary Stuart
is the heart and soul
of our enterprise.

357
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,507
Make sure she
and only she reads this.

358
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,036
We wait for her order.

359
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,249
The order
must be given clearly.

360
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,258
The jailer, madam.

361
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,390
My noble jailer.

362
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,468
Am I a danger to England
even when I pray?

363
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,804
As always, ma'am,
my concern
is for your safety.

364
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,580
I pray for
my cousin Elizabeth.

365
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,751
Do you think
she prays for me?

366
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,462
Is it true

367
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,965
that I've never known
the pleasure of being
liked for myself?

368
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,770
I hope you believe
I like you for yourself,
my lady.

369
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,946
Is anyone ever liked
simply for themselves?
I doubt it.

370
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,812
Are you?

371
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,517
Men like you
because you're pretty,

372
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,017
and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

373
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,597
No doubt.

374
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,059
Him, too.

375
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,567
He likes you because
he wants my favor.

376
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,611
You do realize that.

377
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,673
Yes, my lady.

378
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,613
And the other thing,
too, of course.

379
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,554
But then,
all men want that.

380
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,957
Male desire
confers no distinction.

381
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,190
Oh, I envy you, Bess.

382
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,929
You're free to have
what I cannot have.

383
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,637
You're my adventurer.

384
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,818
Thank you for coming.

385
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,488
You mustn't send
letters to the palace.

386
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,259
You know
what would happen
if I was caught.

387
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,232
I need your help.

388
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,733
More money?
No.

389
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,130
My father doesn't
want to hide
like this anymore.

390
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,197
Of course.

391
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,573
We both want to get
back into favor
with the court.

392
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,168
That's impossible.

393
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,341
You know that
you're Papists.

394
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,780
Why impossible?

395
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,444
Everyone at court
has a Papist somewhere
in their family.

396
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,952
Francis.
Just as you have.

397
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,989
Speak to the Queen.
You are her favorite.

398
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:29,618
My father and I
will embrace the new faith.

399
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,854
Cousin Bess.
No.

400
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,919
We have known
each other
all our lives.

401
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,091
I would do nothing
to harm you.

402
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,598
Why can't you help us?
They will kill us!

403
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:56,517
Oh. Do not tease me,
Mr. Raleigh.

404
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,953
There's nothing
I'd like to do more.

405
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,285
So why don't you?

406
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:05,021
All right, then. I will.

407
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,426
You see? You lie.

408
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,526
You don't want me
on your ship at all.
You're a liar.

409
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,236
Bess. Would you
like to go to sea?

410
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,901
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

411
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,810
Women bring bad luck
on board ship.

412
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,142
Do they?

413
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,615
Lock up a hundred men
in a space smaller
than this room

414
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,948
for months at a time.

415
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,282
Men have needs.

416
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,084
A beautiful woman
would drive us all mad.

417
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,119
Men have needs?

418
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,495
Let them stay on land
and see to their needs.

419
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:48,165
Mr. Raleigh
is eager to sail away
to his maiden colony.

420
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,336
We must persuade him
to stay a little longer.
Mustn't we, ladies?

421
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,293
Bess?

422
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,122
No!

423
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:21,199
Wait! What do you want?
Who are you?

424
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:25,038
Let me go, damn it!
Who the hell are you?

425
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:56,196
If you won't assist me,
perhaps your father will.

426
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,866
No.

427
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,010
Enough.

428
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,743
Enough.

429
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,546
Enough.

430
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,987
Yes?

431
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,382
You cannot
save England now.

432
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,787
The Enterprise
has begun.

433
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,866
Ambassador?

434
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,435
What do you know
of the Enterprise
of England?

435
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,703
The Enterprise?
Forgive me, Majesty,
I'm not familiar...

436
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:36,213
Two armies landing
on the coasts
of Sussex and Norfolk.

437
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,215
Mary Stuart is to be
set free and placed
on the English throne,

438
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,080
and I am to be
assassinated.

439
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,585
Does any of this
sound familiar?

440
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,881
I know nothing
of any invasion plans...

441
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,115
Well, I refer to
this plan as the
Enterprise of England,

442
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,159
<i>it should more
accurately be called
la Empresa de Inglaterra</i>

443
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,023
because it is
a Spanish plan.

444
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,995
The plan of my
one-time brother-in-law,

445
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,929
your king,
to attack my country.

446
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,129
Your country?
It is my country
that is under attack.

447
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,398
<i>Your so-called piratas,
your pirates attack
our merchant ships daily.</i>

448
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,808
And you...
You think we don't know
where the orders come from?

449
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,676
The whole world knows
these pirates sail up
the Thames,

450
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:14,548
all the way
to your royal bed.

451
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,194
You will leave
my presence, sir.

452
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,097
Go back to your rat hole.

453
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:35,570
Tell Philip I fear
neither him, nor his priests,
nor his armies.

454
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,005
Tell him if he wants to shake
his little fist at us,

455
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,303
we're ready to give him
such a bite,

456
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,174
he'll wish he'd kept his hands
in his pockets.

457
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,306
You see a leaf fall
and you think you know
which way the wind blows.

458
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,116
Well, there is
a wind coming, madam,

459
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,485
that will sweep away
your pride.

460
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,321
I, too, can command
the wind, sir!

461
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,927
I have a hurricane in me
that will strip Spain bare
if you dare to try me!

462
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,416
What are you staring at?

463
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:34,089
Lower your eyes.
I am the Queen!

464
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,263
You are not my equal, sir,
and you never will be!

465
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,814
<i>The alignments of the planets
is most unusual this year.</i>

466
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,987
Mars is due to take
the ascendant

467
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:08,150
three days
after the anniversary
of Your Majesty's birth.

468
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,661
And also on that day,
there is a full moon,

469
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:16,894
which governs
the fortune of all princes
of the female gender.

470
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,060
Princes of the
female gender.

471
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,835
I mean to say,
a prince who is
also a woman.

472
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,344
Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

473
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,572
What does it mean?

474
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:36,519
It means the rise
of a great empire, Majesty,
and the fall of another.

475
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,721
Convulsions.

476
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:46,423
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

477
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,727
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

478
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,860
Astrology is,
as yet, more an art
than a science.

479
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,371
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

480
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,067
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

481
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:02,545
He means,
will I be assassinated?

482
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,514
Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

483
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:17,793
And the private life
of this prince
of the female gender,

484
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,022
what do the stars
foretell there?

485
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,895
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

486
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,097
Surely the stars
foretell matters
of state, Dr. Dee.

487
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:32,609
For such a prediction
I must look
in a different chart.

488
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,977
Wonderful.

489
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,316
Such strength.

490
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,485
You will need
all your strength
in the days to come.

491
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,356
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

492
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,600
I have not seen
fear in your face
for such a long time.

493
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,165
Have I reason to fear?

494
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,469
Something has
weakened you.

495
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,306
There are
hard days coming.

496
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,682
But I am no prophet.

497
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,789
I see no more
than the shadows
of ghosts.

498
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,929
Visitor, sir.

499
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:38,869
Sorry to come
aboard your ship

500
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,103
without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

501
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,214
Welcome aboard.

502
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,151
The Queen wishes
to see you.

503
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,224
She asks me
to assure you...

504
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,390
I need
no assurances, Bess.

505
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,395
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

506
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,961
Then you should
say so in person.

507
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,078
This is
my life, Bess.

508
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,451
This is where
I belong.

509
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,524
It seems to be
a lonely life.

510
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:32,494
Sometimes.
But it's the life
I've chosen.

511
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,991
I understand.

512
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,075
You ask permission to go.

513
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,121
Yes, Majesty.

514
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,646
You plan to return
to your colony

515
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:06,185
for two, maybe three,
four years.

516
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,699
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

517
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,101
That is a long time.

518
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,469
There's nothing
for me here.

519
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,976
At sea,
I know what I'm to do.
I know the risks.

520
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,375
Here...
No. You're wrong.

521
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,882
You're needed here.

522
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,746
As captain of my
personal guard.

523
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,115
Captain of your guard?

524
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,175
Kneel.

525
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,744
Majesty.

526
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,222
I said, kneel.

527
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,556
Sir Walter Raleigh.

528
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:51,803
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

529
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,339
This is too great an honor.

530
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,812
If it's so great an honor,
why are you staring
at your boots?

531
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,214
You know why.

532
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,514
Now you stare
at the wall.

533
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,923
Am I so hideous
you can't even look
me in the face?

534
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,017
Why do you speak
like a fool

535
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,154
when you are anything
but a fool?

536
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,823
Fool?

537
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,662
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

538
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,798
And you, you...
You come here

539
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,208
as if from another time.
And I've...

540
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,978
You have real adventures.
You go where the maps end.
And I'd...

541
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,846
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

542
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,133
The storm clouds
are gathering.
You are needed here.

543
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,731
You cannot leave England.

544
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,367
"For he that will
save his life
will lose it.

545
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:36,605
<i>"And he that will
lose his life for my sake
shall find it. "</i>

546
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,782
Lord be with us
as the end approaches.

547
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:46,547
We will not fear the coming
of the shadow of death.

548
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:09,240
Sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

549
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,713
I thought I prayed
in silence.

550
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,010
You did.

551
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:25,884
Excuse me, sir.
I must go to the Queen.

552
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,160
The man who was
hanged today...

553
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:31,757
He was your cousin.

554
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,668
Yes.

555
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,708
I'm sorry.

556
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,710
The last time
I saw him,

557
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,486
he needed my help.

558
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,352
I did nothing.

559
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,120
What could
you have done?

560
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,689
I don't know.

561
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,931
Now he's dead.

562
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:08,870
I keep seeing his face.
I keep seeing his eyes.

563
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,136
Believe me, there's nothing
that you could have done
that would have spared him.

564
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,801
I'm so afraid.

565
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,004
We're all human, Bess.

566
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,943
We do what we can.

567
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,593
<i>Your laundress
was found to be carrying
letters in her washing.</i>

568
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,594
Not her job, I think.

569
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,902
How am I to send
my intimate letters?

570
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:20,602
Through me.
And you will read them.

571
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,646
With respectful
admiration.

572
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,341
Am I to have
no privacy?

573
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,440
No.

574
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,144
You disappoint me, sir.

575
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,714
The Queen orders
these measures
for your protection.

576
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,222
The Queen?

577
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,350
I am a queen.

578
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,501
They call her
the Virgin Queen.

579
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,570
Why is that, sir?

580
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,747
Can it be that no man
will have her?

581
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,633
Let him
throw you round.

582
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,475
Be bold. Come on,
you can trust him.

583
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,378
And jump.

584
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:42,941
When I bend like this,
you take a leap
into the air.

585
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,255
The Volta.

586
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,757
I require all my ladies
to learn it.

587
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,491
You see
how fearless Bess is?

588
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,258
You like your ladies
to jump at your command.

589
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,389
Do you think
that wrong?

590
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:59,663
No. You are the Queen.
You are to be obeyed.

591
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,968
To tell you
the truth,

592
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,269
I'm very, very tired
of always being
in control.

593
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,333
Nonsense.

594
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,708
What?

595
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:13,579
You eat and
drink control.

596
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,346
Is that so?

597
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,420
Bess.

598
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,788
You should try a dance
with Sir Walter.

599
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,157
He's eager
to show us his skill.

600
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,891
No skill at all, Majesty.
I don't know the steps.

601
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:31,160
Come now.

602
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,766
You stand
like this,

603
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,335
with your hands here.

604
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,971
And when she jumps,

605
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,575
on the fifth step,

606
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,317
you lift her.

607
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,253
What could be simpler?

608
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,624
Take your position,
Sir Walter.

609
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,830
I am to be obeyed.

610
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,465
As Your Majesty
wishes.

611
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:13,004
Hold her firmly.
I don't want her dropped.

612
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,685
Play.

613
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,150
Six counts.

614
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,485
One, two, three,
and lift, down.

615
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,660
Leave us.

616
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,462
I want both of them
left alone.

617
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:18,800
Madam.

618
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,347
I must reply.

619
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,353
"If our forces
are in readiness,

620
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,757
"both within and without
the realm,

621
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:50,664
"then your Queen commands you
to set the gentlemen to work."

622
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,564
I think we have it.

623
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,108
Yes.

624
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,345
Let God's
work begin.

625
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,124
Where have you been?

626
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,828
I met up
with some old friends.

627
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,201
From Paris, no doubt.

628
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,206
We haven't
seen you for days.

629
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,866
Yes.

630
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,910
Now you're back.

631
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:44,547
Do you know,
I can still remember
the day you were born.

632
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,691
I was 11 years old.

633
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:55,058
And you,
this helpless bundle.

634
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,029
I looked at you
in your crib,

635
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,263
with your little,
wrinkled face,

636
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,668
and I loved you
from the first.

637
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,298
I've failed you,
haven't I?

638
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,676
Forgive me
if I haven't
loved you enough.

639
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,051
Did you imagine
I wouldn't know?

640
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,535
Your blessing,
Majesty. My little one.

641
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,230
Your blessing?

642
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,211
Walk on.

643
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,930
The Queen is at her prayers.

644
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,773
Go!

645
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:22,308
Elizabeth is a whore!
Mary Stuart is our
true queen!

646
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,888
Elizabeth!

647
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,886
Whore!

648
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,760
You bring news?

649
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,797
The Queen
has been attacked.

650
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,372
The assassin seized.

651
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,884
The Queen

652
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,648
unharmed.

653
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,914
Unharmed?

654
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:14,224
And you, ma'am,
are to be tried
for treason.

655
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,470
Me?

656
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,965
What has any of this
to do with me?

657
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:37,144
That's the trouble
with intrigues, isn't it?

658
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,380
With so many secrets,

659
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:42,117
you can never quite be sure
who's on whose side
till the game ends.

660
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:54,570
Walsingham has every
letter you've written.

661
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,175
Traitor.

662
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:10,208
Traitors!

663
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:51,092
Ready to die,
I see, Jesuit.

664
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,526
I have done what
I was sent to do.

665
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,331
Why was the gun
not loaded?

666
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,151
I need your help.

667
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,983
I, too,
have failed, brother.

668
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,763
What was the Jesuit
sent to do?

669
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,560
I told you everything I know.

670
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,499
So kill me.

671
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,636
There's a better world
waiting for me.

672
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,610
We'll all be judged
in the end, brother.

673
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,640
Even you.

674
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,012
William, you're
not a martyr.

675
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,291
You weren't even
much of a murderer.

676
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,693
I'm going to have you
taken to France.

677
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,569
No one will know.

678
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:12,006
You must never let me
hear of you again.

679
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,078
Francis.

680
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,671
Francis!

681
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,444
Francis.

682
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,085
I've never seen her
so distressed.

683
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:29,647
She's been alone
in her room since morning.
She'll see no one.

684
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,817
Has she asked for me?

685
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:31,985
No.

686
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,495
But she needs you.
I know she does.

687
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,927
Go to her.

688
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,663
Please.

689
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:03,887
Are you here
to tell me I must
murder a queen?

690
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,227
I would
never presume to tell
my Queen what to do.

691
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,832
Only you know
where your duty lies.

692
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,800
Was it my father's duty
to murder my mother?

693
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,134
She was a queen
for a time.

694
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:27,406
Oh, I would be
loath to die
so bloody a death.

695
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,421
Since when were you
so afraid?

696
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,155
I'm always afraid.

697
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,926
Kill a queen,
and all queens are mortal.

698
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:54,367
We mortals have
many weaknesses.

699
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,434
We feel too much.

700
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,844
Hurt too much.

701
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,883
All too soon we die.

702
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,288
But we do have
the chance of love.

703
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,061
Do we?

704
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,497
I have given
England my life.

705
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,668
Must she also
have my soul?

706
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,204
<i>Mary Stuart must die!</i>

707
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,780
Must? Mary Stuart must die?

708
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:37,114
Where is it written?
Who says so?
Have I ordered it?

709
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,814
Majesty, this is
no time for mercy.

710
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,255
Don't preach at me,
old man!

711
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,223
Look at you.
You can hardly stand.

712
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:51,223
Go home to your wife
and your bed.

713
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:55,798
The law must
have its way.

714
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:01,599
By whose authority
do you condemn me?

715
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,637
God is my only judge.

716
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:09,750
The law
is for common men.
Not for princes.

717
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:15,689
The law, Your Majesty,
is for the protection
of your people.

718
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,697
Leave me.

719
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,868
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

720
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:45,816
<i>You know
neither who you are
or what you do.</i>

721
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:50,221
I know who I am.

722
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:54,854
And if I die,
it shall be
as I have lived.

723
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,891
As a queen,

724
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:05,134
trusting in the mercy
of God, my Father.

725
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,413
At which hour?

726
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,508
At 8:00.

727
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,715
Tomorrow morning.

728
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,053
It must be stopped!

729
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,650
I want it stopped!

730
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:05,253
I forgive you
with all my heart.

731
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,884
<i>Forgive me, Majesty.</i>

732
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,485
I have failed you.

733
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,596
How have you failed me?

734
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,965
What am I
to forgive you for?

735
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,001
Philip of Spain
is a God-fearing man

736
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:36,003
who cannot declare war
without a just cause.

737
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,669
I intercepted
every letter Mary Stuart
secretly dispatched,

738
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:47,410
but failed to see that Spain
knew I was reading them.

739
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,085
They waited for her
to write the words

740
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,645
that would, in my eyes,
confirm her treason.

741
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,622
Forgive me.

742
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,492
I am trapped
in my own web.

743
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,457
And I ordered
Mary's execution.

744
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:13,264
I murdered God's
anointed Queen.

745
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:20,778
And now God's most dutiful son
makes holy war to punish me.

746
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,679
We are at war.

747
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,982
Who knows when
we will meet again?

748
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,812
If we will meet again.

749
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:08,489
If England falls,
my last days will be
in a Spanish prison.

750
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,392
To die far from home.

751
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,128
That is the
loneliest death.

752
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:15,863
Never.

753
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,466
My thoughts
turn dark.

754
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,671
What do you do
in a storm

755
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,648
when you're facing
your death?

756
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:32,609
The closer
I come to death,

757
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,814
the more
I want to live,

758
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,324
the hungrier
I am for life.

759
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:41,795
Yes. To live
right to the end.

760
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:44,457
Why be afraid
of tomorrow when today
is all we have?

761
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,398
I wish...

762
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,568
I have never known
a woman like you.

763
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:59,039
In some other world,
in some other time,

764
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,150
could you have
loved me?

765
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:08,020
I know only
one world.

766
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,791
And in this world,
I have loved you.

767
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:23,564
There's something
you could do for me,

768
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:30,475
something I
have not known
for a very long time.

769
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:36,175
If you felt
so inclined.

770
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:40,820
But it's not to be
spoken of afterward.

771
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:45,093
It must be forgotten.

772
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,229
But just for now...

773
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,196
A kiss?

774
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,727
I die.

775
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:54,686
I've given
Drake the orders

776
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,390
to prepare the fleet
to defend the Channel.

777
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:57,830
How soon can you
join him?

778
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,766
We're waiting for supplies.
We can move as soon
as we're ready and armed.

779
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:01,962
Good.

780
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,406
Bess.

781
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,408
I have something
to tell you.

782
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:14,243
I ask for nothing.
Is that understood?

783
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:18,713
Your life is your own.
Nothing will change.

784
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,482
What is this?

785
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,888
I am...
You're with child.

786
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:30,062
No one knows.
My plans are made.

787
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,896
I shall ask the Queen
for permission
to leave court.

788
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,060
Where will you go?

789
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:36,366
To my
mother's house.

790
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,100
I'm a ward of the Queen.
I can't court a man
without her permission.

791
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,267
I can't marry
without her permission.

792
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:44,176
As for having a child,

793
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,673
your child...

794
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:52,352
All I know
is nothing's as it should be.

795
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,149
Please, listen.

796
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:57,453
You once said to me,
"Whatever I have to give,
ask and it's yours."

797
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:58,515
Do you remember?

798
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,083
Of course, I remember.

799
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,062
I ask that you
forget me.

800
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,657
Go to your ship.
Do your duty.

801
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,100
Forget me.
Bess!

802
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,603
We're summoned.
Coming.

803
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:24,814
This Spanish Armada
is at sea with an army
of 10,000 men?

804
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:27,411
And Philip's friend,
the Duke of Parma,

805
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,822
has 15,000 men
on the French coast.

806
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,727
They plan to cross
the Channel in barges
and sail into the Thames.

807
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,425
They don't have
enough barges yet.
We have a little time.

808
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:43,460
And our forces
defend the mouth of
the Thames at Tilbury with...

809
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:47,565
What? How...
Four thousand men?

810
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:51,477
Three thousand.
Possibly.

811
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,946
If the Spanish fleet
unites the barges,

812
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,483
their combined strength
will overwhelm us.

813
01:20:57,752 --> 01:21:00,687
Then we shall
engage them at sea,

814
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:02,985
before they have
the chance to unite.

815
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:04,858
Your Majesty,

816
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:09,454
this vast Armada
will surely smash through
our naval defenses

817
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,123
and overrun
us on land.

818
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:15,536
We must prepare
for the worst.

819
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,807
I need air.

820
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,014
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

821
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:03,778
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

822
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:06,912
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

823
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:10,389
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

824
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,723
And with all
my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

825
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:17,561
And with all
my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

826
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:20,465
In the name
of the Father

827
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:26,235
and of the Son,
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.

828
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,874
Bess!

829
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,675
Bess!

830
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,813
Bess Throckmorton!

831
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,558
Here, my lady.

832
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,064
Tell me,
is it true?

833
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,896
Are you with child?

834
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,703
Are you with child?

835
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,532
Yes, my lady.

836
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:02,075
You traitress.

837
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,577
You dare to keep
secrets from me?

838
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,513
You ask my permission
before you rut!

839
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,776
Before you breed!

840
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:12,081
My bitches
wear my collars!
Do you hear me?

841
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,518
Do you hear me?

842
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,716
Majesty! Please,
dignity. Mercy.

843
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:19,089
This is no time
for mercy, Walsingham.

844
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,388
You go to your
traitor brother

845
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,760
and leave me
to my business.

846
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,822
Is it his?

847
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,426
Tell me. Say it.
Is the child his?
Is it his?

848
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,494
Yes.

849
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:35,669
My lady, it is
my husband's child.

850
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,803
You bitch!

851
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:41,508
Majesty.

852
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,951
This is not the Queen
I love and serve.

853
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:54,561
This man has seduced
a ward of the Queen.

854
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:58,258
And she has married
without royal consent.

855
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:02,360
These offenses
are punishable by law.
Arrest him!

856
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:04,405
Go!

857
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,637
You no longer have
the Queen's protection.

858
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:15,376
As you wish,
Majesty.

859
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,815
Get out.

860
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:19,853
Get out! Get out!

861
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,383
Get out!

862
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:54,087
The fall of an empire,
you told me.

863
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,782
Did you mean
the English empire?

864
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:59,088
Because, by God,
England will not fall
while I am Queen.

865
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,628
If that is
your prophecy, sir,
you prophesy again.

866
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,186
You want me to tell
Your Majesty

867
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,061
only what Your Majesty
chooses to hear.

868
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:07,431
I will not be a toy
of the fates!

869
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:10,300
Have I not faced
an assassin's bullet
and lived?

870
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:17,204
Just tell me
there's no certainty.

871
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:19,911
That any outcome
is possible.

872
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:23,212
The shadow of ghosts,
you said.

873
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,319
Please, just
give me hope.

874
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:31,017
The forces that shape
our world are greater
than all of us, Majesty.

875
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,721
How can I promise
that they'll conspire
in your favor,

876
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,991
even though
you are the Queen?

877
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,598
But this much
I know.

878
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:48,631
When the storm breaks,
each man acts in accordance
with his own nature.

879
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,235
Some are dumb
with terror.

880
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,611
Some flee. Some hide.

881
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:57,515
And some

882
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:02,147
spread their wings
like eagles and soar
on the wind.

883
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:12,930
You are a wise man,
Dr. Dee.

884
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,198
And you, madam,
are a very great lady.

885
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,237
Light the beacon!

886
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,855
My lords,

887
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:23,233
I can offer you
no words of comfort.

888
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,105
This Armada
that sails against us,

889
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:31,612
carries in its bowels
the Inquisition.

890
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,204
God forbid it succeeds,

891
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:37,740
for then there will be
no more liberty in England

892
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:40,481
of conscience or of thought.

893
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:46,093
We cannot be defeated.

894
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,958
The bells are to ring
from every tower.

895
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:54,024
Laborers are to
leave the fields,
and take up arms.

896
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,161
The harvest must wait.

897
01:27:57,572 --> 01:28:01,838
All prisoners
are to be released.

898
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:05,144
England is their country, too.

899
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,124
And release Raleigh.

900
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:31,195
He is forgiven.

901
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:36,407
As I, too,
long to be forgiven.

902
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:47,512
Let the fleet know
we're on our way,
Mr. Calley!

903
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:51,253
Fire broadside
from the bow!

904
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:54,552
Run out the prime!

905
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:58,263
From the starboard bow,
number one gun!

906
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,927
On my mark!

907
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,061
Discharge! Two!

908
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:06,504
Three! Four!

909
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:35,160
Majesty, the enemy
has been engaged.

910
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:37,660
What news?

911
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:40,970
A brave action,
Your Majesty.

912
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,976
Two ships lost.

913
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,705
With what gain?

914
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,304
The enemy continue
to advance.

915
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:58,553
Tighten the buntlines
on the foresail!

916
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,821
Another four
ships lost.

917
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,421
We must continue
to engage and harass
the enemy.

918
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:10,369
We're outgunned,
Drake. Decisively.

919
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:16,166
We're losing too many ships.
We must fall back
and defend the coast.

920
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,675
If the wind
is with us, Walter,

921
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,715
we can attack them
with fire ships.

922
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:24,718
Six fire ships
into the Spanish formation,

923
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,617
that may force
them to scatter.

924
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,382
We can't get
anywhere near them.

925
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:31,721
We have to break
their formation.
That's our only chance.

926
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:37,421
The Spanish
are barely
a day away, Majesty.

927
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:40,160
We must withdraw
to safe ground.

928
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:45,763
I beg you to appreciate
the gravity of the situation.
There is very little time.

929
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:25,137
My loving people.

930
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,548
We see the sails
of the enemy approaching.

931
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:35,583
We hear the Spanish guns
over the water.

932
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:42,786
Soon now,
we will meet them
face to face.

933
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:48,292
I am resolved in the midst
and heat of the battle

934
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:52,032
to live or die
amongst you all!

935
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:01,514
While we stand together,
no invader shall pass.

936
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:05,450
Let them come
with the armies of hell!
They will not pass!

937
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:11,583
And when this day
of battle is ended,

938
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:15,395
we meet again in heaven

939
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,694
or on the field of victory.

940
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:07,605
Thomas! Get up!
Get up, man! Get up!

941
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:18,622
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

942
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:20,661
Help me!

943
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:06,801
They've dropped anchor.

944
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:10,002
These Spanish monsters
can't handle
our English seas.

945
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:14,041
We have the wind
in our favor.

946
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:15,742
Do we go?

947
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:20,320
We go.

948
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,914
Godspeed, my friend.

949
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:26,888
Walter?

950
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:28,826
Don't forget to jump.

951
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,474
Calley!

952
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,208
Enough tar!
Clear the deck!

953
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:53,082
If that cannon's primed,
set the fuse!

954
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:59,624
Get everybody
off the ship, now!

955
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:06,591
Get off the ship!
Off the ship!
Go!

956
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,965
Get over there!

957
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,630
Come on, boys!
Get going!

958
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:10,130
The Spanish
continue to advance.

959
01:36:10,197 --> 01:36:12,631
Just five of their ships
are burning.

960
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:19,035
Not enough.

961
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:46,235
Amen.

962
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:52,462
Francis?

963
01:42:11,358 --> 01:42:16,455
I have served Your Majesty
in all things.

964
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:20,391
I know it.

965
01:42:22,769 --> 01:42:25,602
You won't need me anymore.

966
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:41,177
You rest here,

967
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:47,324
old friend.

968
01:43:26,233 --> 01:43:29,066
Elizabeth has a son.

969
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,834
You must be proud.

970
01:43:33,907 --> 01:43:35,807
Very.

971
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:38,436
And fulfilled.

972
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:41,106
As any man can be.

973
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:46,910
Do you still dream
of your shining city
in the New World?

974
01:43:48,188 --> 01:43:50,053
Always.

975
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,274
I'd like to give
your son my blessing.

976
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:19,542
I'd be honored.

977
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:25,376
<i>I am called
the Virgin Queen.</i>

978
01:45:26,953 --> 01:45:29,148
<i>Unmarried,</i>

979
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:31,816
<i>I have no master.</i>

980
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:35,359
<i>Childless,</i>

981
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:39,193
<i>I am mother to my people.</i>

982
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:45,203
<i>God give me strength
to bear this mighty freedom.</i>

983
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:50,807
<i>I am your Queen.</i>

984
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:55,177
<i>I am myself.</i>
