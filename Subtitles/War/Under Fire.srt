(vehicles approaching)

00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:17,019
- Can l get a ride?
- Allez-y voir le camion.

13
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:29,784
Hey, Pricey. You tuna-sucking piece
of raw meat, get your ass over here.

14
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:30,950
Move over.

15
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:33,126
Sit down here.

16
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,918
- How you doin'?
- Good.

17
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,919
Good to see you. What the hell
you going to Zambeze for?

18
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:43,096
l thought l'd get some great shots
of your head being blown to smithereens.

19
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:45,262
Smithereens!

20
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:50,305
- Thought you were with the government.
- l am.

21
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:53,011
- This is the government.
- These are the rebels.

22
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:56,150
The fuck they are. This is
a government convoy to Calunda.

23
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:59,397
This is the Abou Deian revolutionary front.

24
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,452
You're shittin' me.

25
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,369
They'd be pissed off if they knew.

26
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:22,589
This is the dumbest motherfucker l ever
signed up for, man. lt don't even pay shit.

27
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:25,470
Nicaragua. That's the spot.

28
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:28,636
Cheap shrimp, lotta rays.

29
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:32,468
lt's real thin in the spook department too.
You dig me?

30
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:11,680
Price, l don't what you're doin',
but you'd better get your ass down here.

31
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,764
Come on, man.
You're gonna get ripped to shit.

32
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,221
(gunfire)

33
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:43,208
Oates, what the hell is this?

34
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:47,668
The US government offers that house to
any Cuban pilot flying MiGs for the rebels

35
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:50,422
who chooses to defect to America
with a Russian jet.

36
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:53,590
- But that's bullshit.
- We know that, but they don't.

37
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:58,266
They figure the Cubies will go for that
pool, so they don't let them near the jets.

38
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:00,434
The rebels can't fly MiGs.

39
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:04,395
Pricey, that's the point.
They destroy their own air force.

40
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,442
lt's an old scam,
but it's guaran-fuckin'-teed.

41
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,239
- Who is this? ClA?
- Yeah.

42
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,069
The smartest guys in the world.

43
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,203
l guess we found out
where the government is.

44
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,573
You can walk to work from here.

45
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,742
What a break.

46
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:28,044
l guess l'll get goin'. Take care.
Be careful.

47
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,927
(Price) l love Africa.

48
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,393
(woman) So this strange war
grinds into its seventh year.

49
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:51,609
From Ndjamena, Chad,
this is Claire Sheridan.

50
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,402
No, no, you didn't hear any music.
lt must be the connection.

51
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:57,774
OK. Yes. Goodbye.

52
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,783
Alex, don't play that goddamn thing
when l'm filing. We're late.

53
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,245
lt's my party. We'll be late.

54
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,130
You called it a strange war.

55
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,842
lf you filed that story with me,
l would say you were editorialising.

56
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,640
Well, l like to editorialise.

57
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:24,007
- Are you drunk?
- Drunk?

58
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:28,762
Only with the memory of making love
to you on the plains of Fianga,

59
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:32,847
with the First Liberation Army
marching by, and opening fire.

60
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,819
- We freed the proletariat?
- And we freed...

61
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,986
l'm going to the party without you.

62
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,251
l don't wanna go to this party.
l'm bad at false modesty.

63
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:54,164
- You're great at it.
- You're right, l am.

64
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,968
Alex, you're gonna make
a great anchorman in New York.

65
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:03,842
Undoubtedly l could win an Emmy
as a hostess, but l'm not going with you.

66
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:07,886
You could operate out of New York.
We could buy a place, burn our suitcases.

67
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,141
l still like suitcases.

68
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:14,141
l'm tired of memorising the President
of the Republic of Maldives.

69
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:19,066
- You tired of Third-World wars?
- No, l'm tired of Third-World elevators.

70
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:22,273
Look... Wait.

71
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,782
Don't leave me.

72
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,946
l have to, Alex.

73
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:34,952
Fuck Abou Deia and New York.
l'm goin' to Nicaragua with you.

74
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:39,297
- No!
- lt's a neat little war and a nice hotel.

75
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:41,462
Hey!

76
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,214
Alex! Alex!

77
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:52,051
Come on! Yeah!

78
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:58,732
All right, l want you to know this is
the man that hired me for my first job.

79
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:01,563
And fired you from your first job.

80
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,991
- And then hired me for my second job.
- And fired you!

81
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:12,660
Some of you may be asking yourself
''What am l doing in this strange war?''

82
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:18,079
Another chapter in an endless struggle
that's grinding into its seventh year.

83
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:23,290
But who of us can forget the giant
struggle on the plains of Fianga?

84
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,665
The give and take, the lunging,

85
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:30,847
the parrying for position,
the jockeying around, knowing full well...

86
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,132
Thank you very much. Look at this.

Yes, you did. You were taking
pictures of me all over the room.

94
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,848
Well, you know...

95
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:23,852
l mean...

96
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,736

- Thanks.

97

Here.

98
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40,367
This is for Alex.

99
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:45,370
That's lovely, but it's not the best thing
you could give him right now.

100
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:50,330
- Why not?
- We just split up.

101
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:53,716
- Who split up from who this time?
- This time?

102
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:56,002
This time l'm the villain.

103
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:59,969
l thought it would be cleaner with me
in Central America and him in New York.

104
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:03,016
Did he shout about
burning your suitcases?

105
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:05,183
Yeah.

106
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:10,355
Well...

107
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,734
l don't own any suitcases.
There's nothing to burn.

108
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,663
This is a great shot.

109
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:37,250
Yes, it is.

110
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,140
NlCARAGUA, 1 979

111
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:55,601
(band playing and singing)

112
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,951
Espérate.

113
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,533
- Vamos.
- Síganme.

114
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,579
(singing continues)

115
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,232

(screaming)

119
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:20,948
- Hey, Russel. How are you?
- Hey!

120
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:38,304
- Ah... Welcome to Managua.
- Did you have anything to do with that?

121
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:42,763
Well, l thought of calling your
photographs ''The Pictures of a Lost War''.

122
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:46,514
The New York editors loved it,
since they didn't know where Chad was.

123
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:49,355
lt kinda legitimised their ignorance.

124
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:52,729
You got your cover, l got a feature.

125
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,616
A class struggle in three little words.
Nifty, huh?

126
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,781
Nifty, l say.

127
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:00,570
- l'm Russel Price.
- This is lsela Cruz.

128
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:03,409
She works at the hotel,
also as a translator.

129
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,580
My pleasure.

130
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:09,497
You guys have a few
problems down here,

131
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,207
between the ''poets''...

132
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:14,381
and the government?

133
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,546
Problems? Down here it's called a war.

134
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,217
lt started in 1 930, before you were born...

135
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:23,135
Excuse me. My Spanish is not good.
What did he say?

136
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,851
He said he considers it an honour
to be able to photograph our war.

137
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,187
- He's got a real way with words.
- l can tell.

138
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,985
- You're a hell of a translator.
- l know.

139
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:35,396
l'm much in demand around here.
Will you excuse me?

140
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,365
- lf you have any questions, just ask.
- Who's Rafael?

141
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,650
Depends on who you ask.

142
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,905
Rafael. Comandante Rafael.

143
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:46,576
He is either a Marxist dupe
of Russia and Cuba

144
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:50,751
or the most popular leader of
a democratic revolution. Take your pick.

145
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,499
Hell of a face.
Would he like to be photographed?

146
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,204
- You would never find him.
- Wanna bet?

147
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,675
You would lose.
He's never been photographed.

148
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:03,468
- Congratulations on your elephants.
- Oh, thank you.

149
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:12,389
So far, Alex, this war
has the hell beat out of Africa.

150
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:14,932
- You're gonna have a ball.
- (man) Alex!

151
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:18,732
Hands off, OK? l need a translator
much more than you do right now.

152
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,902
Aren't you hangin' in there with Claire?

153
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:24,199
l'm hangin' in there,
like an interim post-war government

154
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,162
waiting for the palace to be
overrun by younger men.

155
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:29,364
Younger men?

156
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:33,117
Yeah, Russel. You know,
l still only have one major weakness.

157
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,787
- Oh, only one?
- Yeah. l hold onto things too long.

158
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,462
l'm too loyal.

159
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:49,218
OK, Alex, listen. Jody borrowed
100 rials from me in Tehran.

160
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,059
l owe 40 bucks to Dick, and he'll pay me
in lire for a future in pesos. Good rate.

161
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:57,474
But you gotta pay Eddie in dollars,
so l can square it with Chuck.

162
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,732
We got it all worked out - cash.

163
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:03,447
- You take Nicaraguan?
- No cordobas.

164
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:06,776
But l'll go double or nothing
with you on the whole pile.

165
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,818
OK.

- Spy is such a nonword, Mr Price.

- Russel prefers pictures to words.

You are journalists.

OK, l'm a businessman.

311

You were arrested because the Guardia
are clowns who specialise in excess.

312

You were released because
l told them to release you.

314
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:42,291
Those aren't the normal
duties of a businessman.

315
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,797
But they are the normal duties of a spy.

316

00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:56,994
And once a week l have lunch
with President Somoza

334
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:01,248
to discuss security measures
against the Sandinista insurgents,

335
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:04,292
and all he wants to talk about
is Miss Panama.

336
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,412
He is worried about her.

337
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:13,004
- He thinks she's seeing another man?
- He assigned me to find out who he is.

338
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,469
Thank you.

339
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,386
We all know the revolutionaries
are going to win.

340
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:25,978
Don't we?

341
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:32,185
You know, l saw this picture
on a leaflet in Africa.

342
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:34,360
You know what they all say about it?

343
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,242
That you're the genius
that created that idea.

344
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:39,824
lt was a lot of people's idea.

345
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:45,786
Have you been to León?

346
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:48,040
- No.
- No, we're going to Masaya.

347
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:50,839
We understand the rebels
have entered the cuartel.

348
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:56,504
You would love León.
A nice cathedral. Beautiful light.

349
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,839
- We're not doing a travelogue.
- Of course, of course.

350
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:04,599
Only l have heard that Comandante Rafael
was recently in the area.

351
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:09,722
- Rafael's near León?
- Well, it's a rumour. What do l know?

352
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:13,641
Marcel, estoy desamparada.

353
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:18,820
- She's lonely.
- Well, we don't want to keep you.

354
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:20,989
lt's my job.

355
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,574
Do you think l talk too much?

356
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,915
(Russel) So Rafael's near León.

357
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:40,293
Did you dream about
Miss Panama last night?

358
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:43,594
No. l dreamed about you.

359
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:48,305
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah. So did you.

360
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:54,727
ls that an old war injury flaring up?

361
00:33:55,693 --> 00:33:58,480
- ls that tape recorder on?
- Absolutely.

362
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,229
l was sunning myself on the USS Pueblo
when the North Koreans attacked.

363
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,904
l took a bullet in the chest.
But l was lucky.

364
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:09,239
l had a roll of Ektachrome
in my pocket here over my heart...

365
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:12,824
And the bullet ricocheted
over the film and grazed your cheek...

366
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,830
Saved my life. You heard about it, huh?

367
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:29,850
- Do you ever dream about me?
- Yeah, once.

368
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:32,015
How was it?

369
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,394
Fast.

370
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:37,012
- How fast?
- Real fast.

371
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,599
You mean this fast?

372
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,279
(camera clicking)

373
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,701
That's another Rafael sign.

374
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,187

375
00:35:29,574 --> 00:35:32,243
LEÓN

(gunfire)

378
00:36:08,612 --> 00:36:11,529
lt's June 10th. The evacuation of León.

379
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:15,237
Signs for the FSLN are everywhere.

380
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:20,786
(gunfire)

381
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:26,368
A woman carries a pig.

382
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:34,591
(man) Carlos!

383
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:16,422
(explosion)

384
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,253
Do you want photographs?

385
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,382
Come with us.

386
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,936
- You must help us one more time.
- For León, for Nicaragua.

387
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:16,306
No, l don't want to.

388
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,069
- Americans?
- Yes.

389
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:25,199
Journalists, sí?

390
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:27,733
Pedro, there's no time to waste.

391
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:42,542
When you get back to the States, l want
you give this ball to Dennis Martinez,

392
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:47,421
- from me, sí? Dennis Martinez, sí?
- Dennis Martinez.

393
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:52,558
Enrique is dead. The Guardia control
the church and we need your help.

394
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:02,352
Pedro.

395
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:10,617
- You come. You come, huh?
- Yes.

396
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:12,986
Use the back way.

397
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:47,903
(aircraft)

398
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,277
The Guardia have the stairs covered.
Go through the courtyard.

399
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:14,717
(gunfire)

400
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:17,303
lt's not safe. Come with me.

401
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,787
Aquí, aquí. Rápido.

402
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,091
Ahora! Fuego!

403
00:41:03,478 --> 00:41:05,516
Ahora, súbete!

404
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:36,505
A la torre!

405
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:56,728
Listo?

406
00:42:29,268 --> 00:42:31,675
(gunfire)

407
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:34,267
- Por aquí.
- Ya los vi.

408
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:48,450
Bring out your dead and wounded.

409
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:12,929
Price, is that you?

410
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,140
- You motherfucker, Price, is that you?
- Yeah.

411
00:43:18,523 --> 00:43:21,097
Where are those bastards?
They away?

412
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:25,061
They're away.

413
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:38,243
- You all right?
- Yeah. lt's not my blood.

414
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:41,492
- Man, that kid's got a good arm.
- Yeah.

415
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:49,135
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What the fuck are you doing here?

416
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:54,058
Man, my ears are freakin' out.

417
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,471
You're lookin' good.

418
00:44:02,815 --> 00:44:06,861
- How do you like Nicaragua?
- lt's beautiful.

419
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:12,198
Yeah, there's a shitload
of greasers, though.

420
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:15,944
(man) No queda nadie.

421
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:18,652
- Pricey, l'll see you later, man.
- Yeah.

422
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,366
Se acabó, vámonos!

423
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:25,959
- You OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

424
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:28,705
The kid's got a hell of an arm.

425
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,086
Sandy Koufax, no?

426
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:33,302
- Gracias, padre.
- De nada. Vayan con Dios.

427
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:39,507
Koufax was good.

428
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:42,181
But Dennis Martinez, he is the best.

429
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,638
He's from Nicaragua.

430
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:48,062
He pitches major leagues.

431
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:53,612
- l'd like to find Rafael.
- He was here, but he's gone.

432
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,898
He's going to Matagalpa, no?

433
00:44:56,033 --> 00:44:59,367
You control a baseball
better than your words.

434
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:02,579
Rafael cannot be found.
You understand, compañeros?

435
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:04,948
What's Rafael doing in Matagalpa?

436
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:07,290
Just keep your talk to baseball.

437
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:12,506
You see Dennis Martinez,
you tell him that my curve ball is better,

438
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:14,875
that l have a good scroogie.

439
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:18,847
l like Sandinistas.

440
00:45:18,972 --> 00:45:21,428
And l like Baltimore Orioles.

441
00:45:24,102 --> 00:45:26,142
(Russel) You bastard!

442
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:42,947
- What are we gonna do about him?
- He's dead.

443
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,193
(Claire) You can't believe
everything you hear in the news.

444
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:23,783
l think about you all the time.
l'll try and get back before you graduate.

445
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,614
l love you very, very much.

446
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:30,446
l'll finish this up back at the hotel, honey.
Bye-bye now.

447
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:57,434
l know who shot Pedro.

448
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,488
Somebody in the bell tower.

449
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,608
- Why didn't you tell the guerillas?
- Because l knew they'd kill him.

450
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,946
And l didn't wanna interfere.

451
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,752
lt wasn't an easy choice.

452
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,919
l think l made the wrong one.

453
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:41,056
Do you know that you didn't shoot any
pictures after that whole thing was over?

454
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,857
l didn't, did l?

455
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,988
Oh, Jesus, l picked up the gun.

456
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,541
ls something happening to us?

457
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:07,457
Yeah, l think so.

458
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:11,008
Yeah, l know.

459
00:50:06,164 --> 00:50:10,162
- How was Matagalpa?
- No bang-bang, Alex. None at all.

460
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:13,662
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah. Half the press corps.

461
00:50:20,428 --> 00:50:22,467
Hello?

462
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:27,591
Claire.

463
00:50:27,726 --> 00:50:29,765
Hey!

464
00:50:56,837 --> 00:50:59,080
- Alex.
- How you doing?

465
00:51:00,383 --> 00:51:02,837
- How was León?
- Bloody.

466
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:07,677
Claire, l'm tired of Nicaragua.

467
00:51:07,806 --> 00:51:10,379
- You haven't been here very long.
- Yeah.

468
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,307
Long enough.

469
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,310
Long enough.

470
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,431
You're right. Everybody's right.

471
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:23,109
About what?

472
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:27,982
My cheekbones.
What do you think of 'em?

473
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,027
l like your cheekbones, Alex.

474
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,452
ls there anything the matter?

475
00:51:35,582 --> 00:51:38,038
lt's a face made for television.

476
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:44,126
You mean you decided
to go with the network?

477
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:46,297
Yeah.

478
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:52,264
They're gonna give me
ten grand a week to read the news.

479
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,641
l'm gonna be in 60 million homes
every night.

480
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:58,057
When l take a breath,
all of America will do so.

481
00:51:58,188 --> 00:52:01,972
When my voice trembles,
all of America will tremble.

482
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:04,267
l'm gonna be a star.

483
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:08,862
My voice will be more important
than who controls Congress.

484
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,153
- You'll become a household name.
- l'll become a household name.

485
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:18,372
l should never have come down here.

486
00:52:21,168 --> 00:52:25,461
l'm sorry, Alex.
l think it's a lot better this way.

487
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:28,163
lt's all right. Don't worry about me.

488
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:33,006
l'm speaking in song titles.

489
00:52:33,138 --> 00:52:36,970
- But promise me one thing.
- l'll promise you anything.

490
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,311
No farewell parties. l don't wanna
make a speech to anyone.

491
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:46,901
- Russel?
- Russel who?

492
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,480
Him too.

493
00:53:52,547 --> 00:53:55,085
(♪ ''Cuando calienta el sol'' ♪)

494
00:54:11,774 --> 00:54:14,230
- Ça va bien?
- Comment ça va?

495
00:54:18,448 --> 00:54:22,444
You're running late, Mr President.
We can schedule this for another time.

496
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:26,194
Nonsense. Let them wait.

497
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:32,162
We are a stunning couple, huh?

498
00:54:32,293 --> 00:54:35,330
My stomach is like a rock.
l've been working out.

499
00:54:35,463 --> 00:54:37,503
Yes, we are a stunning couple.

500
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:41,676
Mr President, you own
one fifth of the land in Nicaragua.

501
00:54:41,803 --> 00:54:44,590
You own the port, the airlines,
the Mercedes dealership...

502
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:46,964
ls it a crime to be a car dealer?

503
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,841
Let me show you something.

504
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:56,437
lt's said that the Guardia operates
a torture chamber at Coyotepe.

505
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,809
This is a portrait of my father.

506
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:02,198
He was very special to me.

507
00:55:02,322 --> 00:55:06,949
Every Sunday morning l drive out to the
cemetery and put flowers on his grave.

508
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:09,235
l think people should know that.

509
00:55:09,371 --> 00:55:11,992
Would you comment on
the fall of León to the rebels?

510
00:55:17,044 --> 00:55:21,506
Listen, Russel. Let's grow up, huh?
lt's easy to fall in love with the underdog,

511
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:24,337
but there's an upside
and a downside to this thing.

512
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:28,383
l just wanna remind you all this stuff
about a ''revolution of poets'' is crap.

513
00:55:28,514 --> 00:55:31,006
lt's great PR though, isn't it, Hub?

514
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:34,425
So what's the upside?

515
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:36,803
Simple, and it could happen.

516
00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:40,059
Somoza destroys the insurgents,
rebuilds the country,

517
00:55:40,192 --> 00:55:43,442
shitcans the purveyors of excess,
stabilises the cordoba,

518
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,650
and is finally beloved as
the saviour of Nicaragua. Our pal.

519
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:49,822
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah.

520
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:58,239
- What's the downside?
- Commies take over the world.

521
00:56:00,461 --> 00:56:02,501
Señor Kittle.

522
00:56:09,387 --> 00:56:12,257
Excuse me, Russel,
but the war may be over.

523
00:56:15,434 --> 00:56:19,847
This is a democracy, and l have
been freely elected by my people.

524
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:23,395
- There were more votes than voters...
- Presidente!

525
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:27,737
No me ven que estoy ocupado
con esta señorita? Váyase de aquí.

526
00:56:33,118 --> 00:56:36,985
l am sorry. l have to conclude
this encounter. Something happened.

527
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,493
l have many more questions,
Mr President...

528
00:56:39,624 --> 00:56:42,541
Did he tell you about his parents
and the graveyard?

529
00:56:42,668 --> 00:56:45,919
- Yes, l know about that, but l'd like to...
- Good, good.

530
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,949
(applause)

531
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:31,746
- l'll just make sure everything's set up.
- Sí, rápido.

532
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:46,225
My friends, this gathering was not
supposed to be a press conference

533
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:48,976
as much as a get-together.

534
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:51,894
But l've just been handed
a piece of news.

535
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,810
Rafael is dead.

536
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,191
He has been killed in an ambush
near Matagalpa.

537
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:02,817
- Mr President!
- How many people killed?

538
00:58:02,954 --> 00:58:06,239
Sorry, my friends. No questions, please.

539
00:58:06,374 --> 00:58:08,947
A press release is being prepared.

540
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,124
Call Washington.

541
00:58:14,298 --> 00:58:15,958
What do you think?

542
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:19,839
Tacho makes that speech about
every six months. Maybe he got lucky.

543
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,840
- Hub, is this for real?
- Yeah, sure.

544
00:58:22,973 --> 00:58:28,346
Russel, excuse me, but Miss Panama
would like her picture taken with Tacho.

545
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,514
- ln colour?
- OK. A little embarrassing, huh?

546
00:58:35,026 --> 00:58:37,149
Señor presidente.

547
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:39,318
Listo, listo.

548
00:58:39,447 --> 00:58:41,855
That'll be fine right there.

549
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:47,072
How in the hell could Tacho find Rafael?

550
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:50,445
Russel, please. l have my hands full.

551
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:54,493
That's fine right there.

552
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:58,293
ls Tacho lying again?
They did kill him, didn't they?

553
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:01,088
What do l know?

554
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,792
Tacho needs a victory very badly.

555
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:07,629
He needs to prove to Jimmy Carter
that he is still winning.

556
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:10,387
The death of Rafael is the proof he needs.

557
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:14,219
Carter doesn't need proof. He just sent
25 million in new arms to Tacho.

558
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:16,598
No, no. He didn't.

559
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:22,650
The State Department is getting nervous
about what is going on down here.

560
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,152
En el sol, por favor.

561
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:32,495
Pardon my French,
but whose fucking side are you on?

562
00:59:32,623 --> 00:59:36,668
- l work for everybody.
- That's a great job.

563
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,626
l send messages to Jimmy and l tell him
that the revolution is a flood

564
00:59:40,756 --> 00:59:43,959
which cannot be stopped,
but it can be controlled.

565
00:59:44,968 --> 00:59:47,423
Nobody listens to me.

566
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:50,424
l can't even get a little water in my pool.

567
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:53,134
(Miss Panama giggles)

568
00:59:53,268 --> 00:59:56,470
Would you switch sides, please?
For just one more.

569
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:01,806
That's very nice, very nice. Thank you.

570
01:00:03,444 --> 01:00:06,481
l think Rafael is alive. l'm gonna find him.

571
01:00:08,115 --> 01:00:09,859
Thank you very much.

572
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,283
MATAGALPA
NORTHERN PROVlNCE

573
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:14,450
(gunfire)

574
01:00:20,752 --> 01:00:24,038
- There's the guy we're lookin' for.
- Terrific.

575
01:00:36,392 --> 01:00:38,634
Go one more block.

576
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:46,395
Oh, shit! l'm not gonna die in Matagalpa.

577
01:00:47,152 --> 01:00:49,144
Pare. Pare.

578
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:52,398
Alto. Alto!

579
01:00:52,657 --> 01:00:55,326
- Calm down, Regis.
- l'm not stayin'!

580
01:00:57,161 --> 01:01:01,324
For Christ's sake, they wanted to look
at our credentials. What are you doing?

581
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:05,366
Me escuchan?
Si va una combi, deténganla.

582
01:01:17,388 --> 01:01:19,713
Bájese! Alto!

583
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:23,718
Get down!

584
01:01:29,232 --> 01:01:31,058
Jesus!

585
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,190
Look out!

586
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,159
Stop! Stop it!

587
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:56,502
- Periodista.
- Televisión.

588
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,339
Let's go!

589
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,718
(Regis) Abre la puerta, por favor!

590
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,893
Gracias, señora.

591
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,059
You all right?

592
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:24,777
Asesinos!

593
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,584
Ahora.

594
01:02:44,716 --> 01:02:46,755
Aguante.

595
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,550
Alto! Alto!

596
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:52,806
Stay down.

597
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,704
Libertad!

598
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:08,990
(Russel) Periodista.

599
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,165
- You all right?
- Yeah.

600
01:04:12,045 --> 01:04:13,954
Periodista.

601
01:04:21,678 --> 01:04:24,169
- Viva Rafael!
- Que viva!

602
01:04:48,995 --> 01:04:51,034
Entren.

603
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:07,506
The translator from the hotel.

604
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:11,678
You're looking for Rafael?

605
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,057
- Yeah, if it's possible.
- How'd you know?

606
01:05:15,602 --> 01:05:19,931
Mr Price doesn't do anything before
announcing it first to the whole world.

607
01:05:20,064 --> 01:05:23,397
lt's a good story. You'll be more famous.

608
01:06:42,388 --> 01:06:44,428
Vengan, compañeros.

609
01:07:07,411 --> 01:07:09,652
What is it?

610
01:07:10,288 --> 01:07:12,744
Rafael is dead.

611
01:07:14,459 --> 01:07:16,831
- l can smell it.
- Vengan acá.

612
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:20,287
Come on.

613
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,097
What were you talking about?

614
01:07:42,234 --> 01:07:44,273
He's dead. l know it.

615
01:07:45,612 --> 01:07:48,067
(Claire) l wonder what they want with us.

616
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:50,611
l don't know.

617
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:54,199
No les he dicho nada.

618
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,742
- This is Comandante Cinco.
- Es un placer.

619
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:02,124
León has fallen
and today we took Matagalpa.

620
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:04,493
Masaya is next and then Managua.

621
01:08:04,796 --> 01:08:07,251
Because Nicaragua
will soon be free, Mr Price,

622
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:10,133
we've decided that it's time
for you to meet Rafael.

623
01:08:10,259 --> 01:08:14,470
- We need a photograph.
- The Western press needs a photograph.

624
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:17,632
The world is not divided
into East and West any more.

625
01:08:17,766 --> 01:08:21,300
lt's divided into North and South.
Come with us.

626
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:08,640
You're a great photographer.
Make him alive.

627
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,193
(chuckles)

628
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,894
Why are you laughing?

629
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:24,656
You're crazy.

630
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:29,411
We have momentum,
but many more lives will be lost.

631
01:09:30,123 --> 01:09:34,831
Even Washington is starting to admit
that Somoza is not loved by his people.

632
01:09:35,544 --> 01:09:39,209
They have detained $25 million
in new arms shipments to Somoza

633
01:09:39,339 --> 01:09:41,462
at an airfield in Florida,

634
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:45,505
until they find out
if Rafael is alive or dead.

635
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:51,178
lf Washington thinks Rafael is dead,
they will ship the arms to Somoza.

636
01:09:52,351 --> 01:09:54,806
Do you understand?

637
01:09:56,855 --> 01:09:58,894
Yes.

638
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:05,153
- l'm a journalist.
- This has nothing to do with journalism.

639
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,315
Enough of our people
have been lost already.

640
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,992
We need to keep him alive
a few more days.

641
01:10:13,453 --> 01:10:17,616
Once the war is over, none of this matters.

642
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:28,335
l don't do things like this.

643
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:33,463
l know this is difficult for you,

644
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:35,636
but you must do it.

645
01:10:44,731 --> 01:10:47,898
ln the morning, when there's better light.

646
01:10:49,861 --> 01:10:52,103
lt will be a great picture.

647
01:11:06,376 --> 01:11:09,293
lt sure would be
a prizewinner, wouldn't it?

648
01:11:10,421 --> 01:11:12,710
l've won enough prizes.

649
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,082
But you haven't won a war.

650
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:18,508
Are you sure?

651
01:11:29,438 --> 01:11:31,478
Foto muy complicado, huh?

652
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:42,278
Yeah, it's complicated, all right.

653
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:45,991
Do l go back and say l missed
the biggest story in the war?

654
01:11:47,955 --> 01:11:51,288
Do l go back and say that
l saw Rafael stone-cold dead?

655
01:11:56,713 --> 01:12:01,670
Or do l just say that we fell in love with
the guerillas because their cause was...

656
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:03,840
Sympathetic?

657
01:12:04,678 --> 01:12:06,920
Yeah, sympathetic.

658
01:12:21,944 --> 01:12:24,399
Christ, what are we doing here?

659
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:49,138
You.

660
01:13:49,272 --> 01:13:51,810
Más arriba.

661
01:13:51,942 --> 01:13:53,851
That's fine.

662
01:13:55,695 --> 01:13:57,734
Yeah, that's good.

663
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:28,929
All right.

664
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:25,688
Viva Rafael!

665
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:29,025
Viva Rafael!

666
01:15:55,928 --> 01:15:57,967
Marcel.

667
01:16:00,224 --> 01:16:02,975
-  Le gusta?
- Mucho, mucho, mucho.

668
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:05,141
Gracias.

669
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:20,162
(Claire) Under a still, grey July sky...
Start again.

670
01:17:20,588 --> 01:17:23,921
Under a clear, steel Managua... Scratch it.

671
01:17:26,802 --> 01:17:32,092
President Somoza has ordered the air
force to bomb the capital under a sky of...

672
01:17:45,026 --> 01:17:47,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

673
01:17:49,864 --> 01:17:52,865
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

674
01:17:55,202 --> 01:17:59,034
- (Russel) What the hell is he doing here?
- l have no idea.

675
01:18:08,047 --> 01:18:11,213
(Regis) Can you frame me
with that smoke in the frame?

676
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:13,714
- Yeah, we got the smoke.
- Well, roll it.

677
01:18:13,844 --> 01:18:15,717
Speed.

678
01:18:15,846 --> 01:18:18,087
This is Regis Seydor in Managua.

679
01:18:18,932 --> 01:18:23,261
This tiny nation of smouldering volcanoes
has erupted into a civil war.

680
01:18:23,686 --> 01:18:27,470
Fighting has broken out on the streets
of the capital for the first time...

681
01:18:27,606 --> 01:18:29,350
Hi.

682
01:18:29,483 --> 01:18:31,226
- Alex.
- Congratulations.

683
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,352
- On what?
- ''On what?''

684
01:18:33,487 --> 01:18:37,187
The news services, the wire,
The Washington Post, The Times.

685
01:18:37,323 --> 01:18:39,861
Everybody's got it. lt's a fabulous picture.

686
01:18:39,992 --> 01:18:43,076
- Yes, it really is fabulous.
- Yeah, it is.

687
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:47,456
- How come you're back?
- l came back to see Russel.

688
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,990
See me? About what?

689
01:18:50,127 --> 01:18:54,539
The East Coast is in love with Rafael.
They were sure he was dead this time.

690
01:18:54,672 --> 01:19:00,377
They're gonna do a musical. You can't
move without seeing his mug on T-shirts.

691
01:19:00,511 --> 01:19:03,132
He's bigger than Farrah Fawcett.

692
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:05,386
(explosion)

693
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:15,974
You look great. Things OK?

694
01:19:16,108 --> 01:19:20,521
Things are great, yeah. l've never
been happier. You two, uh...?

695
01:19:20,654 --> 01:19:22,896
- Terrific.
- Yeah?

696
01:19:23,949 --> 01:19:26,819
Alex, you know me, l'm a little slow.

697
01:19:29,203 --> 01:19:31,908
Exactly why are you here?

698
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:34,079
l wanna do an interview with Rafael.

699
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,781
You're the only man
who can take me to him.

700
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:43,544
- What's the matter?
- Nothin'.

701
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:00,768
We may not be able
to find him, you know.

702
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:03,472
l have supreme confidence in you.

703
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:10,487
- Claire looks good.
- Everybody looks good in the tropics.

704
01:20:10,616 --> 01:20:12,857
What the hell does that mean?

705
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,079
- Alex, l'm in love with her.
- l know, and she thinks she loves you.

706
01:20:21,209 --> 01:20:23,995
No, it's past the thinking stage.

707
01:20:24,128 --> 01:20:29,751
Can l ask you something? This probably
doesn't mean a goddamn thing, but...

708
01:20:29,883 --> 01:20:32,290
it's something that interests me.

709
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,503
Were you guys making it
before we came here?

710
01:20:34,637 --> 01:20:35,882
No!

711
01:20:36,014 --> 01:20:38,172
- ls that the truth?
- Yes.

712
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:41,469
For God's sakes, Alex. We're friends.

713
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,681
OK.

714
01:21:00,244 --> 01:21:02,283
Alto. Alto.

715
01:21:06,374 --> 01:21:09,577
Periodista. Periodista.

716
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:11,750
- Bájese!
- Prensa, prensa.

717
01:21:17,593 --> 01:21:19,632
Periodista.

718
01:21:26,476 --> 01:21:28,634
Periodista.

719
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:33,061
Vamos.

720
01:21:33,607 --> 01:21:34,770
Vamos.

721
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:43,278
Buenos días.

722
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:53,492
- You must go through a lot of rental cars.
- Don't worry. l put it in your name.

723
01:21:55,502 --> 01:21:57,210
Give me your papers.

724
01:21:57,337 --> 01:21:59,376
(machine-gun fire)

725
01:22:11,683 --> 01:22:13,426
Come on, come on.

726
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,147
Get those bodies on the truck... fast!

727
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:32,525
And you too! Now!

728
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:36,614
Hey, Pricey! Welcome to
Somoza's meat market.

729
01:22:37,456 --> 01:22:40,029
Hey, no pictures, huh? lt might look bad.

730
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:43,290
What do you get paid,
by the hour or by the body?

731
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,661
l get paid the same way you do.

732
01:22:46,881 --> 01:22:50,748
What the fuck are you doin' in Sebaco?
This place is about to blow.

733
01:22:50,885 --> 01:22:54,088
- Why'd you shoot Pedro?
- Who the fuck is Pedro?

734
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:57,847
Jesus Christ.

735
01:22:57,975 --> 01:23:02,435
There's a motherfuckin' war
goin' on here, pal! A lot of sad stories.

736
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,452
- Do you know those guys?
- Yeah. l used to.

737
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:24,331
- Motherfuckin' cocksucker!
- l don't suck no dick!

738
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,165
- You goddamn...
- Hey, hey, hey!

739
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:30,918
l prefer not to blow your brains out
in a dump like this! l got my priorities!

740
01:23:31,046 --> 01:23:35,090
You better get him outta here before he's
a number. lt'd be a shitty town to buy it in.

741
01:23:35,216 --> 01:23:38,419
- Why them? Just why them?
- Why them?! Why them?

742
01:23:38,553 --> 01:23:42,004
Come here, l'll show you why them.
You too. Come on.

743
01:23:42,139 --> 01:23:43,966
Come here.

744
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:50,766
lf your mug shows up in this box, you
come through Sebaco, l own your ass.

745
01:23:51,189 --> 01:23:54,640
- Where did you get those photographs?
- ls this a fuckin' interview?

746
01:23:54,776 --> 01:23:58,109
l'm not gonna quote you.
Where'd you get those pictures?

747
01:23:58,237 --> 01:24:00,479
Off the record?

748
01:24:01,615 --> 01:24:03,904
Some Pachuco gives 'em to me.

749
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:07,568
Ain't none of my business,
but l hear he gets 'em from a Frenchy.

750
01:24:07,704 --> 01:24:10,823
They say Somoza likes women,
but this one ain't got a chance.

751
01:24:10,957 --> 01:24:13,282
Nice, huh?

752
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:16,418
You ever meet Tacho?
A real piece of work.

753
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:22,417
Oh, Jesus.

754
01:24:22,968 --> 01:24:25,541
- ls she dead?
- Not yet.

755
01:24:29,057 --> 01:24:31,464
Hey, give me those pictures.

756
01:24:32,852 --> 01:24:36,303
Hey, you got any dope?
Tough place to find decent dope.

757
01:24:38,482 --> 01:24:42,313
What do you expect?
We're the ones gettin' our butts kicked.

758
01:24:45,488 --> 01:24:49,651
Some motherfucker stole my pictures
and l don't know what fuckin' happened!

759
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,741
Goddamn it! Fuck me!

760
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:55,487
- Didn't you ship your film to New York?
- No, l developed it in my room.

761
01:24:55,622 --> 01:24:57,864
Oh, Jesus Christ, Alex!

762
01:24:57,999 --> 01:25:01,332
Slow down, man. lt's not your fault
if somebody took your...

763
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:03,453
Yes, it was.

764
01:25:05,214 --> 01:25:07,253
What about Rafael?

765
01:25:27,151 --> 01:25:29,902
- l don't think it's Jazy.
- He said it was a Frenchman.

766
01:25:30,028 --> 01:25:33,148
How many Frenchmen
do you know who live around here?

767
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:35,320
(alarm)

768
01:25:42,039 --> 01:25:43,118
Quédense aquí.

769
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:54,755
l'll look here.

770
01:26:00,013 --> 01:26:02,765
- Are we looking for negs or prints?
- Anything.

771
01:26:04,643 --> 01:26:06,884
- (banging)
- Abran la puerta!

772
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:16,608
- l'll get the door.
- Yeah.

773
01:26:17,613 --> 01:26:20,068
Abran la puerta o la tenemos que bajar.

774
01:26:28,539 --> 01:26:30,578
Rápido!

775
01:26:35,545 --> 01:26:37,419
- What do you want?
- Where is Mr Jazy?

776
01:26:37,547 --> 01:26:38,792
He's not here.

777
01:26:38,923 --> 01:26:41,675
- Who are you?
- l'm his girlfriend.

778
01:26:47,723 --> 01:26:50,807
No, no, l'm sorry.

779
01:26:50,934 --> 01:26:53,176
Excuse me, gentlemen.

780
01:26:55,355 --> 01:26:57,643
That man has a lot of girlfriends.

781
01:28:14,635 --> 01:28:16,674
Russel?

782
01:28:17,596 --> 01:28:19,635
Russel?

783
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,395
He knew l'd find Rafael.

784
01:28:34,152 --> 01:28:37,603
He wanted me to.
Probably even knew he was dead.

785
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:43,198
And l'd take pictures of
every fuckin' thing l saw.

786
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:48,446
He kills people.

787
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:52,574
Let's get outta here.

788
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:01,131
(door unlocked)

789
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:07,219
Hola.

790
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:29,283
(Alex) We've been to every bar in town.
l still don't see Rafael.

791
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:31,901
Yeah, well, just hang in there a minute.

792
01:29:35,624 --> 01:29:38,411
This is what l wanted to show you.

793
01:29:38,543 --> 01:29:43,371
You brought us through three roadblocks
to show us a statue of Tacho?

794
01:29:43,506 --> 01:29:46,044
lt's not Tacho. lt's Mussolini.

795
01:29:47,635 --> 01:29:51,763
Tacho went to ltaly
to commission a statue of himself.

796
01:29:51,889 --> 01:29:55,968
He found a warehouse full of
il Duces on horseback.

797
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:59,101
He got a great deal on one.
Brought it back here.

798
01:30:00,438 --> 01:30:03,392
He switched heads.

799
01:30:03,524 --> 01:30:05,766
You can't tell, can you?

800
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,605
What are we doin' here?

801
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:17,364
l think what he's trying to say,
what we're trying to say,

802
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:20,698
is that things aren't exactly
the way they seem to be.

803
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:26,294
Well, things don't seem to be too great,
so l can't wait to hear this one.

804
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:30,713
Here we are, two guys in love with the
same dame, in the tropics, bullets flying...

805
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,209
- Alex, that's not why we're here.
- Oh, yeah?

806
01:30:34,344 --> 01:30:38,804
l left this country because of this man.
l came back because of this man.

807
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:42,015
Now the cutest couple in town's
got me looking up a horse's ass

808
01:30:42,142 --> 01:30:44,348
on a midnight tour of Managua.

809
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:46,719
What's goin' on?

810
01:30:56,864 --> 01:30:59,105
Rafael is dead.

811
01:31:02,202 --> 01:31:05,072
- ln the picture he's dead?
- He's dead.

812
01:31:08,624 --> 01:31:12,075
- How in the hell did you...
- Who cares how?

813
01:31:12,211 --> 01:31:16,422
Alex, l think l finally saw
one too many bodies.

814
01:31:19,384 --> 01:31:21,839
Somoza is a killer.

815
01:31:22,846 --> 01:31:26,261
l thought the war would end sooner.
How many reasons do you want?

816
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:29,391
You saw too many bodies?
That's a lot of bodies.

817
01:31:30,102 --> 01:31:32,675
You stupid son of a bitch.

818
01:31:32,813 --> 01:31:36,597
- Did he talk you into this?
- No. l wanted Rafael to be alive.

819
01:31:36,733 --> 01:31:38,772
Had you been there you'd understand!

820
01:31:38,902 --> 01:31:42,021
l've seen a hundred Rafaels,
a hundred Somozas.

821
01:31:42,155 --> 01:31:45,108
Don't you ever tell me who's sentimental!

822
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:48,609
You just served me up your careers.
l could bury both of you.

823
01:31:48,744 --> 01:31:51,910
Look around you. Look at the war.
Can't you see what's goin' on?

824
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:56,166
l'm not just talking about Rafael.
That's a lie l despise, but l understand.

825
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:58,961
l'm talking about
the two of you lyin' to me.

826
01:31:59,087 --> 01:32:01,458
l didn't know how you'd take it, Alex!

827
01:32:03,257 --> 01:32:05,830
How could you lie to me?

828
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:08,793
This is a motherfuckin' story.

829
01:32:13,183 --> 01:32:15,424
What am l supposed to do with it?

830
01:32:56,013 --> 01:32:58,550
Have you found Rafael yet?

831
01:33:05,313 --> 01:33:08,847
You know, there's a rather strange one
goin' around about him.

832
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:11,390
Thought you might have the answer.

833
01:33:17,657 --> 01:33:20,741
You see, there's a rumour
that Rafael is dead,

834
01:33:21,577 --> 01:33:23,985
that Price's pictures are phoney.

835
01:33:32,754 --> 01:33:35,162
That's bullshit. Rafael's alive.

836
01:33:36,549 --> 01:33:38,589
All right, mate.

837
01:33:40,678 --> 01:33:42,717
Alex.

838
01:33:43,889 --> 01:33:46,427
Listen... l feel terrible.

839
01:33:47,851 --> 01:33:50,306
- l wanna talk.
- l don't.

840
01:33:54,732 --> 01:33:58,564
Listen, tomorrow l want you
to take me to try to find Jazy.

841
01:33:59,695 --> 01:34:04,570
l'll do a piece on this sexy French spy
and then New York can take it or leave it.

842
01:34:05,283 --> 01:34:08,035
We looked for Rafael
and couldn't find him.

843
01:34:10,121 --> 01:34:12,790
- You owe me one.
- Yeah, right.

844
01:34:25,343 --> 01:34:28,095
Are you sure this is the way to Jazy's?

845
01:34:28,388 --> 01:34:32,467
l hope so. l might have got
turned around at the last roadblock.

846
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:39,642
Rápido! Rápido!

847
01:34:45,236 --> 01:34:48,071
l thought he lived near here,
but it feels different.

848
01:34:48,197 --> 01:34:51,400
(Alex) Yeah. When did
the fighting get this close?

849
01:35:14,471 --> 01:35:16,629
Where in the hell are we?

850
01:35:16,764 --> 01:35:19,884
l don't know. l don't know
what's going down here.

851
01:35:22,978 --> 01:35:25,434
This looks pretty rough.

852
01:35:26,356 --> 01:35:29,725
This town looks like
it's ready to go, Russel.

853
01:35:42,746 --> 01:35:44,785
- (pig squeals)
- (gunfire)

854
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,789
(Alex) Jesus!

855
01:35:51,713 --> 01:35:54,797
Alex, l don't like this.
Let's get the hell outta here.

856
01:35:54,924 --> 01:35:57,794
- Which way is the hotel?
- l'm not sure.

857
01:36:00,345 --> 01:36:02,137
- Turn here.
- Let's go.

858
01:36:25,952 --> 01:36:28,952
- Take the flag with you.
- l'll ask this old gal.

859
01:36:30,915 --> 01:36:32,954
Señora?

860
01:36:38,171 --> 01:36:42,251
Which way is the Hotel Continental?

861
01:36:42,383 --> 01:36:44,921
l don't know. Ask the soldiers.

862
01:37:33,763 --> 01:37:36,004
Al muro. Al muro!

863
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:44,012
Arriba las manos. Arriba!

864
01:37:57,034 --> 01:37:59,073
(camera clicking)

865
01:38:17,552 --> 01:38:20,304
You fucks! You fucks!

866
01:40:01,104 --> 01:40:04,223
Dos a la izquierda,
dos a la derecha, dos más allá.

867
01:40:39,889 --> 01:40:41,928
Psst! Psst!

868
01:40:42,099 --> 01:40:44,138
Señor!

869
01:40:45,685 --> 01:40:47,725
You!

870
01:41:02,909 --> 01:41:05,151
Come, follow me.

871
01:41:09,373 --> 01:41:11,615
This is all l can offer.

872
01:41:13,544 --> 01:41:15,583
Gracias. Gracias.

873
01:41:21,426 --> 01:41:24,960
Ladies and gentlemen.
Señoras y señores.

874
01:41:25,763 --> 01:41:28,468
May l have your attention, please?

875
01:41:28,599 --> 01:41:31,304
El presidente Anastasio Somoza.

876
01:41:38,983 --> 01:41:41,023
lt is with grave concern

877
01:41:41,152 --> 01:41:46,027
that we announce the death of
senior correspondent Alex Grazier,

878
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:50,158
who has been murdered
at the hands of terrorists

879
01:41:50,285 --> 01:41:53,120
operating in the barrio El Dorado district.

880
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:57,822
Roving bands of Sandinista hooligans

881
01:41:57,959 --> 01:42:01,908
have made the streets of Managua
unsafe for our peace-loving citizens.

882
01:42:02,046 --> 01:42:03,326
(Claire sobs)

883
01:42:03,464 --> 01:42:08,920
Our deepest sympathies are extended
to the friends and family of Mr Grazier.

884
01:42:09,469 --> 01:42:13,716
Our international press corps
is herewith informed

885
01:42:13,848 --> 01:42:18,723
that all necessary steps
will be taken to protect its safety.

886
01:42:20,145 --> 01:42:22,897
Mr Kittle has prepared
statements for you.

887
01:42:24,232 --> 01:42:26,272
Thank you.

888
01:42:28,028 --> 01:42:32,155
l have the statements here
if you'd like to come up and get them.

889
01:42:37,453 --> 01:42:41,497
- Can you get me a taxi?
- There are no taxis, sir. No cabs, sir!

890
01:42:45,585 --> 01:42:46,830
Claire, l'm sorry.

891
01:42:46,961 --> 01:42:49,119
- Did you hear from Russel?
- Nobody has.

892
01:42:49,255 --> 01:42:54,000
- Do you wanna help me find him?
- Claire, there's fighting all over the city.

893
01:42:54,134 --> 01:42:57,585
Jesus Christ, Claire.
A human tragedy. What can l say?

894
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,421
Fuck off, Hub.

895
01:43:15,237 --> 01:43:17,276
Muevan la puerta!

896
01:44:04,156 --> 01:44:06,195
Es el fotógrafo yanqui.

897
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:10,154
There's nobody here.

898
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:13,073
You, look in there, and you, over there.

899
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,996
Revisen todo.

900
01:44:36,185 --> 01:44:38,224
Nobody there.

901
01:44:38,478 --> 01:44:40,138
No hay nadie.

902
01:44:40,272 --> 01:44:42,311
Private Garcia, is he there?

903
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,689
ls he there or not?

904
01:44:58,371 --> 01:45:00,410
ls he or isn't he?

905
01:45:01,624 --> 01:45:03,949
- No, he's not there.
- Let's go.

906
01:46:21,321 --> 01:46:23,360
Agarren más municiones.

907
01:46:47,594 --> 01:46:49,634
Russel!

908
01:46:50,389 --> 01:46:52,215
Russel!

909
01:47:03,859 --> 01:47:06,065
Alex?

910
01:47:06,195 --> 01:47:08,436
The Guardia did it.

911
01:47:09,239 --> 01:47:11,481
l've got pictures.

912
01:47:18,873 --> 01:47:20,912
Let's go.

913
01:47:37,723 --> 01:47:40,510
Amigo, hola.

914
01:47:43,061 --> 01:47:45,634
Do you control this area?

915
01:47:46,689 --> 01:47:48,931
Who knows?

916
01:48:06,249 --> 01:48:08,288
(gunfire)

917
01:48:09,543 --> 01:48:11,749
Let's get out of sight for a minute.

918
01:48:13,088 --> 01:48:15,330
Move! Move or l'll shoot.

919
01:48:16,591 --> 01:48:18,584
Muévete. Muévete.

920
01:48:19,928 --> 01:48:21,967
Muévete!

921
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:26,515
Who are they?

922
01:48:26,642 --> 01:48:27,721
They are friends.

923
01:48:27,851 --> 01:48:30,722
-  Quiénes son?
- They are friends.

924
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,931
Son amigos. Amigos.

925
01:48:33,064 --> 01:48:35,685
Shut up or we'll kill all of you.

926
01:48:35,817 --> 01:48:38,058
Which one? Him or him or her?

927
01:48:38,194 --> 01:48:40,233
Kill all of them now!

928
01:48:40,363 --> 01:48:41,145
Here we are.

929
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,822
Shut up! Murderer!

930
01:48:42,948 --> 01:48:46,317
The boys are confused.
They think l had their family killed.

931
01:48:46,451 --> 01:48:51,113
- You are a murderer.
- Murder! Murder is a word for criminals.

932
01:48:51,247 --> 01:48:53,454
l protect the stability of a continent.

933
01:48:53,583 --> 01:48:55,824
- Son of a bitch!
- Pigs!

934
01:48:56,127 --> 01:48:58,878
- Please.
- And you got caught by boys.

935
01:48:59,004 --> 01:49:02,788
Yes. Poets too, l imagine.

936
01:49:04,134 --> 01:49:06,506
ls your recorder on?

937
01:49:06,636 --> 01:49:09,044
Kill her!

938
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,176
Yes.

939
01:49:10,306 --> 01:49:13,093
Good. l have a speech to make.

940
01:49:13,351 --> 01:49:16,185
- Who are you?
- They are journalists.

941
01:49:16,312 --> 01:49:18,138
-  Periodistas?
- Sí.

942
01:49:18,272 --> 01:49:20,063
Take a picture as l blow his head off.

943
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:23,025
No. No photo.

944
01:49:24,527 --> 01:49:25,856
Keep your hands up.

945
01:49:25,987 --> 01:49:30,613
l like you people,
but you are sentimental shits.

946
01:49:31,492 --> 01:49:35,738
You fall in love with the poets.
The poets fall in love with the Marxists.

947
01:49:35,871 --> 01:49:39,204
The Marxists fall in love with themselves.

948
01:49:39,332 --> 01:49:41,953
The country is destroyed with rhetoric,

949
01:49:42,085 --> 01:49:44,576
and in the end we are stuck with tyrants.

950
01:49:44,712 --> 01:49:45,542
Shut up, you bastard!

951
01:49:45,671 --> 01:49:47,296
Calma.

952
01:49:48,257 --> 01:49:52,171
Somoza, he is a tyrant too,
of course, a butcher.

953
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:55,295
But finally, that is not the point, you see.

954
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:59,558
lf we wish to survive,
we have a choice of tyrants.

955
01:49:59,684 --> 01:50:03,931
And for all the right reasons,
your poets chose the wrong side.

956
01:50:04,063 --> 01:50:06,269
Shut up! Take the picture now!

957
01:50:07,399 --> 01:50:09,724
- No. No picture.
- Yes!

958
01:50:10,277 --> 01:50:15,401
Your picture of Rafael was brilliant,
but l am alive and better-looking.

959
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:19,898
A good-looking Frenchman,
with a sympathetic face,

960
01:50:20,036 --> 01:50:22,277
is murdered in cold blood

961
01:50:22,413 --> 01:50:25,532
while fighting for the survival
of Europe and America.

962
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:27,705
You will have another magazine cover.

963
01:50:27,834 --> 01:50:29,993
- What are these bastards saying?
- l don't know!

964
01:50:30,128 --> 01:50:32,204
Let's kill them all.

965
01:50:32,338 --> 01:50:34,580
Muy complicado.

966
01:50:34,716 --> 01:50:36,293
Take the picture or get out!

967
01:50:36,425 --> 01:50:42,344
- You chose the wrong side.
- ln 20 years we will know who is right.

968
01:50:43,223 --> 01:50:45,928
Get out!

969
01:50:46,059 --> 01:50:50,721
Are you going to take the picture as the
bullet enters the skull or as it comes out?

970
01:50:50,855 --> 01:50:53,097
- Shut up!
- Don't move!

971
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:55,774
lt's just a story.

972
01:50:55,901 --> 01:50:57,360
Shut your mouth.

973
01:50:57,486 --> 01:51:02,444
They say that if somebody is holding
a gun on you, you shouldn't stop talking.

974
01:51:02,574 --> 01:51:05,147
That's the theory.

975
01:51:05,285 --> 01:51:07,443
Who knows?

976
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:11,029
Maybe it's a good thing
that l talk too much.

977
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:13,534
(gunshot)

978
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:29,095
(car horn)

979
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:34,390
(gunfire)

980
01:51:35,896 --> 01:51:39,264
We gotta get outta here.
The whole fuckin' army's looking for me.

981
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:41,557
Yeah. They're not looking for me.

982
01:51:42,193 --> 01:51:47,068
Let me take the film. lf l can't make it
back to the hotel, l'll come back here.

983
01:51:48,991 --> 01:51:52,739
Look, it's more dangerous
being with you than being alone.

984
01:51:54,579 --> 01:51:56,618
Right.

985
01:51:58,583 --> 01:52:00,908
Get the flag. We'll put the film in it.

986
01:53:51,476 --> 01:53:53,468
ls anyone there?

987
01:53:58,274 --> 01:54:01,856
- What is it?
- l need to get this to the hotel.

988
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:04,227
Please come in.

989
01:54:37,768 --> 01:54:39,807
Russel!

990
01:54:41,438 --> 01:54:43,679
(helicopter overhead)

991
01:54:44,524 --> 01:54:46,563
Russel?

992
01:54:51,738 --> 01:54:53,197
Russel!

993
01:54:57,577 --> 01:54:59,616
(gunfire)

994
01:55:09,004 --> 01:55:11,043
(screaming)

995
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:17,667
(announcement from helicopter)

996
01:55:31,024 --> 01:55:34,060
- Have you seen this man?
- No, l haven't.

997
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:36,900
(horn)

998
01:55:37,822 --> 01:55:40,277
Abran paso!

999
01:56:27,283 --> 01:56:29,524
Lo ha visto?

1000
01:56:31,787 --> 01:56:33,826
No.

1001
01:56:47,092 --> 01:56:50,295
(TV) ..Russel Price,
un bien conocido foto-journalista

1002
01:56:50,429 --> 01:56:52,635
que estaba viajando con Grazier.

1003
01:56:52,764 --> 01:56:56,215
El presidente Somoza
ha cambiado su posición anterior,

1004
01:56:56,351 --> 01:56:59,636
y ahora dice que el tiroteo fue accidental.

1005
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:03,768
Tacho, como Somoza es conocido
popularmente, ha regresado...

1006
01:57:41,975 --> 01:57:44,014
Journalist?

1007
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:47,516
You knew the man who was killed?

1008
01:57:50,775 --> 01:57:53,265
50,000 Nicaraguans have died,

1009
01:57:54,153 --> 01:57:56,643
and now one Yankee.

1010
01:57:56,780 --> 01:58:01,027
Perhaps now Americans will be
outraged at what is happening here.

1011
01:58:03,536 --> 01:58:05,659
Perhaps they will.

1012
01:58:05,788 --> 01:58:12,075
Maybe we should have killed
an American journalist 50 years ago.

1013
01:59:09,804 --> 01:59:11,843
(helicopter)

1014
01:59:55,345 --> 01:59:59,805
1 7 July, 1 979 - President Anastasio
Somoza flees to Miami, Florida

1015
01:59:59,932 --> 02:00:02,886
with the bodies of his father and brother.

1016
02:00:39,385 --> 02:00:42,338
- Have you seen the Guardia?
- No, l haven't.

1017
02:00:42,471 --> 02:00:45,424
- ls the war over yet?
- l don't know.

1018
02:00:46,433 --> 02:00:48,888
The tanks are coming!

1019
02:01:36,394 --> 02:01:38,434
Russel?

1020
02:02:13,803 --> 02:02:17,337

(Oates) Hey, Price.

1024

Hey, Pricey!

1025
02:03:11,688 --> 02:03:14,144

What the hell are you doin' here?

1028
02:03:21,405 --> 02:03:23,362
lt's a free country.

Nica libre. Rum and Coke, no ice.
You want some?

You aren't gonna turn me in, are you?

02:03:45,427 --> 02:03:47,550
See you in Thailand.

1033
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:13,273
