00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,267
NARRATOR: This motion picture
is dedicated to

2
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:50,133
France. More than 300 years ago,
French missionaries were
sent to Indochina

3
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:53,200
To teach love of God
and love of fellow man.

4
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,533
Gradually, French influence
took shape in the
Vietnamese land.

5
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,400
Despite many hardships,
they advanced
their way of living

6
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,967
And the thriving nation
became the rice bowl of Asia.

7
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:07,067
Vast riches were developed
under French guidance
until 1941,

8
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,067
When Japanese troops moved in

9
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,533
And made the rice bowl
red with blood of the
defenders.

10
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,833
In 1945, when
the Japanese surrender
was announced,

11
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,567
A Moscow-trained
Indo-Chinese revolutionist

12
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,533
Who called himself
Ho Chi Minh

13
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:25,067
Began the drive to make his
own country another target
for Chinese Communists.

14
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:29,100
Headquartered in the
North, he called the
new party Viet Minh.

15
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,067
With the end of
the Korean War,

16
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:34,267
France was left alone
to hold the hottest
front in the world,

17
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:38,133
And became the
barrier between communism
and the rape of Asia.

18
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,667
Members of the Foreign Legion
imported from North Africa

19
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,867
Fought valiantly
under the French flag,

20
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,633
But the ammunition
pipeline from Moscow
could not be found.

21
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,567
Bombs and shells
made in Russia were
stocked in secret tunnels

22
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,800
Along the mountain range
of the China Gate.

23
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,733
This arsenal was winning the
war for the Communists.

24
00:02:55,833 --> 00:03:01,467
Bombs and shells stocked
underground smashed
village after village.

25
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:05,567
But still fighting for
her life, 100 miles
from the China Gate,

26
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:09,800
Is the dying village
of Son Toy, the last
holdout in the North.

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,200
Her supplies have
been ambushed,
her ammunition depleted,

28
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,100
But she fights
as she starves.

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,633
Her only chance of survival
is the American food air-drop
from the South.

30
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,267
The year, 1954.

31
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,400
The day, Thursday.

32
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,700
The time, 10:00
in the morning.

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,533
All animals have
been eaten. All but one.

34
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,600
(AIRPLANE DRONES)

35
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,900
(CLAMORING)

36
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,367
Food! Food!

37
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:27,267
How's Pierre?
Pierre's hungry.

38
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,700
Food!

39
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,267
Keep off the road,
understand?

40
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,067
Come on, Leung.

41
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,767
(CANNON FIRING)

42
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,400
(EXPLOSION)

43
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,800
It's gonna blow.
Look out!

44
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,067
Spread out!

45
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,733
(EXPLOSION)

46
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,600
COLONEL: Thank you, sisters.
Thank you very much.

47
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,200
You look wonderful,
Lucky, just wonderful.

48
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,467
Now that's the way
I like to see you.

49
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,833
I want you to meet
Captain Gaumont
of the Air Force.

50
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,433
He has been
pulled out of action
specifically to meet you.

51
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,367
Captain, this
is Lia Sermer.

52
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,233
So you're the one
they call Lucky Legs?

53
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,600
I keep them covered
on social calls.

54
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,700
I heard they are hollow,
to keep your cognac in.

55
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,067
(CHUCKLES)
You'll never find out.

56
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,967
What's on your mind,
Colonel?

57
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:40,567
I know what an ordeal it
is for you to stay sober,
but this is important.

58
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,767
Mmm-hmm.
Important to whom?

59
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,067
Important to all of us.

60
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,300
This is an aerial photo
of the border.

61
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,967
There are hundreds of tunnels
here along those hills and
mountains at the China Gate.

62
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,833
You got me sober
to tell me that?

63
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,133
I know you know
about those tunnels.

64
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,567
What's this all about,
Colonel?

65
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:03,467
Somewhere in this area is
a big dump of bombs and shells

66
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,467
And small arms
ammunition that are
crippling our troops.

67
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,167
Everybody knows that.

68
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:12,400
But no one knows just
exactly where it is.

69
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,833
Some of our bombers
got through, but hit
nothing vital.

70
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:19,367
We have sent out
patrols but they never
got back.

71
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:23,967
You know the 100 miles
from here to the border
like you know your cognac!

72
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:27,567
You have made this trip,
oh, a hundred times
with your cousin.

73
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,167
Those Reds trust you.
That's why we need you.

74
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:37,200
Above all,
you know Major Cham at
the China Gate.

75
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:46,333
My business with the
Major is strictly
my business.

76
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:49,633
We are interested in the
Major because he is
the lock to the dump

77
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,367
And you are the only key
that can open him up.

78
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,633
This isn't my war!

79
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,100
You are part Chinese!
Ah!

80
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm a little of
everything and
a lot of nothing.

81
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,233
The Chinese say I'm this,
the French say I'm that,
the Americans say I'm...

82
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,167
(SIGHS) As far
as I'm concerned

83
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:13,533
You and the hammer and sickle
boys can go fight it out
among yourselves.

84
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,067
When the dump is blown,
there should be

85
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,133
A chain reaction
through the whole area.

86
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,867
In the confusion,
we steal a plane.

87
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,933
My job is to fly
you back here to Son Toy.

88
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,500
We will give you $5,000.

89
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,500
We'll open a new bar for
you in Saigon

90
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
And stock it with the finest
wines and liquor.

91
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,167
It's a deal?

92
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,200
No.

93
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:45,400
All right, then.
Name your own price.
How much do you want?

94
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,700
I want to get
my son to America.

95
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,567
He has no criminal record,
no disease.

96
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:00,633
He's five years old
and his eyes are a cross
he's got to carry.

97
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,067
But in America,
I think that cross
would be lighter.

98
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,900
You know the right people.

99
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,367
You use your influence
for my son and I'll find
that dump for you.

100
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:15,667
No. The laws are
strict in America.

101
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,267
All right.

102
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,767
Lucky! Wait a moment.

103
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,967
In this particular case,

104
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,167
I think we can
work it out.

105
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,800
When do we start?
Right away!

106
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,600
I have a pleasant
surprise for you.

107
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
(LAUGHS)
What? A bottle?

108
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,800
(LAUGHING)

109
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
Send him in.

110
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,967
You remember
the American dynamiter,
Sergeant Brock?

111
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,067
He is with the
Foreign Legion now.

112
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,433
He will be in charge
of explosives.
(SLAPS)

113
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,900
The deal's off!
Find the dump yourself!

114
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,900
COLONEL:
But I don't understand.

115
00:11:56,067 --> 00:12:00,900
I thought it would be a
wonderful reunion for
both of you on this job.

116
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,367
It would make
everything more pleasant.

117
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:09,233
I knew you lived
together in Saigon,
but what happened?

118
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,700
We just didn't live
together, Colonel.

119
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,767
We were married,
in church.

120
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,067
Oh, you could have
bought her for $30
for two years

121
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,867
As a government-registered
wife.

122
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,100
That's right.

123
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,933
Well, then, did she find
you with another woman?

124
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,633
Is that why
she slapped you?

125
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,667
No. I walked.

126
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,967
Oh, that happens every
day in this part of
the world.

127
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,200
GAUMONT: Oh, yes, it could
have been worse.

128
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,633
It is. No.

129
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:38,867
What do you mean?

130
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:44,167
She told me her
father was Caucasian
and her mother Chinese.

131
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,767
Who'd ever take
her for Chinese?
Even half Chinese?

132
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,367
One thing I always
wanted was a kid.

133
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,100
We wanted the baby
born in America.

134
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,467
It just didn't work
out that way.

135
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,567
The baby was born
in Saigon.

136
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:07,067
When the doctor
phoned me, I ran.

137
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,600
I ran all the way
to the hospital.

138
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,600
I saw my baby.

139
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,567
It was like a bomb
had hit me.

140
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,467
I walked.

141
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,667
Why?

142
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,167
He was Chinese.

143
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,867
What did you expect?

144
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:31,767
A notarized guarantee that
the baby would be born with
eyes aimed your way?

145
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:35,867
Do you know why
she volunteered to go
on this mission?

146
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,267
For your son.

147
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:40,600
I promised him America
if she would find the dump.

148
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,067
Son?

149
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,067
Yes. You've got a son.

150
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:53,467
He's five years old.
He has no criminal record,
no disease.

151
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:57,067
The only cross
he has to carry
are his eyes.

152
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:06,767
You married me
six years ago in Saigon.

153
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,067
Brock, Johnny Brock.

154
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,600
I was a Sergeant
in the American army then.

155
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,833
I married Lia.
Lia Sermer, don't
you remember?

156
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:25,333
Yes. I thought you
were killed in Korea.

157
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,200
You hate my guts, don't
you, Father?

158
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
What did the Colonel want
you to discuss with me?

159
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,933
We need Lia's help
on a patrol.

160
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:44,633
A demolition job.
She said she'd go
until she saw me.

161
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:47,367
I've got to go,
I'm the dynamiter.

162
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:50,533
She's the only one who can
get us through to the Gate.

163
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:53,567
The Colonel thought you
could help me change her mind.

164
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,533
Why should I help you?

165
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:59,233
Because her feeling for
me isn't as important as
going on this job.

166
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,133
Her father taught her
all about women.

167
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:05,400
Her Chinese mother taught
her all about men,

168
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,067
But didn't teach her
enough about hypocrites.

169
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,067
You married a beautiful woman
to satisfy your own vanity.

170
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,233
To me, that's a
criminal act.

171
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,867
After you left her
she became known
as Lucky Legs.

172
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:26,333
Lucky Legs, that's what
they call her.

173
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,767
They say she ran
an opium den.

174
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,900
That she was
mixed up in murder,

175
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,667
That she caused a man
to take his life,

176
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,067
That she operated in
black markets and lived
like a princess,

177
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,300
And lived like a prostitute.

178
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,133
They say she's a traitor
to France, they say she's
a traitor to the Chinese Reds.

179
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:48,300
They say.

180
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,833
The gossips.

181
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:55,667
Those envious ones who
take pride in spreading lies.

182
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:59,067
I know they're lies,
because I know
this woman.

183
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,900
I know what she went
through to feed your child.

184
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,833
The Communists
tore off my leg

185
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:16,467
And knifed a sign
in my side reading
"capitalist spy."

186
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,733
Lia found me
on the outskirts
of the village.

187
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:24,800
She cut off the
gangrenous flesh and
carried me to the hospital.

188
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,067
Help you?

189
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,100
Stay out of her life!

190
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,233
I shouldn't have slapped you.

191
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,833
I should've shot you,

192
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:11,667
But your army would've
tossed me in prison,

193
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,700
And your son over there,

194
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,167
Yeah, that's your son,

195
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,467
He'd be scrounging garbage
like a rat.

196
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,567
Take a good look
at him, Brock.

197
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,100
You didn't have time
when he was born,
remember?

198
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,633
When I saw his eyes,
I got sick inside.

199
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:35,333
He was so ugly.
Chinese all the way
down the line.

200
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:40,467
First time I met you,
you said children should
be seen, not had.

201
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,733
You should have done
what you preached.

202
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,967
Look, I wore no halo
when we got married.

203
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,700
You knew how I felt about
half-castes and their kids.

204
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,300
Then why did
you marry me?

205
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,300
Because you didn't look like
a 30-buck Chinese bride.
That's why!

206
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,667
I didn't come to beg.

207
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,433
Tell the Colonel
you tried.

208
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,067
And don't stop
on your way out
to pat my son like a dog!

209
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,500
Don't dig his grave because
you can't stomach me.

210
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,067
He's living on
borrowed time now.

211
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,067
He'll never get
another chance
to go to the States.

212
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,867
* China Gate

213
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,233
* China Gate

214
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:06,800
* Many dreams
and many hearts

215
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,300
* You separate

216
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:21,767
* Like two arms open wide

217
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:25,867
* Some you welcome in

218
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:31,567
* And some must stay outside

219
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,733
* Bowl of rice

220
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,067
* Bitter tea

221
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:46,567
* Is this all the good earth

222
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:51,367
* Has to offer me?

223
00:19:56,233 --> 00:20:01,833
* Will I find peace of mind?

224
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,600
* Does my true love wait

225
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,433
* Behind the China Gate?

226
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,333
* China Gate

227
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,100
All right, check your
equipment and hardware.
Kruger?

228
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,200
Explosives and grease gun.

229
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,267
BROCK: Charlie!
Lead wire and
automatic carbine.

230
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,800
Andreades.
Explosives and
automatic carbine.

231
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,367
Goldie!
Explosives and grease gun.

232
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:12,933
Janszi!
Food, extra ammo and
automatic carbine.

233
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:16,533
Pigalle!
Explosives and
automatic carbine.

234
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,333
All right.

235
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,367
These, we've got to watch.

236
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:26,100
They're primers.
They set off the explosives.

237
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,900
You just tap one
of them and they
can blow us apart.

238
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,800
That's why we've got to keep
them away from the explosives
at all times.

239
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,500
Now, I'm carrying this box
of 50 of them.

240
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,867
I've got 50 more.

241
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,467
Now, I want one of you guys
to stick your neck out
and carry the other box.

242
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,900
I'll carry it.

243
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,600
That wraps it up,
Captain.

244
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,300
Now, I don't want
trouble over this woman.

245
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,067
She has a job to do,

246
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,400
We will finish it.

247
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:42,800
LUCKY: You wanna blind me?
Kill that light!

248
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,533
Lucky?
Who else did you expect
this time of night?

249
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:50,967
Pull in the mines!
It's Lucky Legs!
Pull in the mines.

250
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,733
Cognac, huh?

251
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:15,067
Lucky Major. You know,
my mother should have
raised me to be an officer.

252
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,767
You better get
this floor fixed.
How's your village?

253
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,567
Rubble.

254
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,600
Your child all right?
So far.

255
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,433
Oh, we had a bad one today.

256
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,333
Yes. I saw our
planes fly over.

257
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,367
Did they hit your bar?

258
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,533
LUCKY: Oh, that was
wrecked days ago.
I hid my cognac underground.

259
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:41,733
There's one thing that
bothers me, Lucky.

260
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,367
Yeah? What's that?

261
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,767
I've been stuck here
for more than a year,

262
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:01,967
Making sure these French
don't infiltrate to hit
our supply line.

263
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,833
Do me a favor, Lucky,
but don't make it obvious.

264
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:10,500
When you're with
the Major, drop a word
how nice it would be

265
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,833
If I could be transferred
to Sambor-Treng.

266
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,167
MAN: I haven't seen
my family in a year.

267
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:18,233
I, uh... I'll try
to swing it.

268
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,933
I've never heard of any
man saying "no" to you.

269
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,267
(GIGGLING)

270
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,067
We tie up here.
The rest of the way we walk.

271
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,300
The river bends west.
We go northeast.

272
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
(SPITTING)

273
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:40,067
Say, Goldie, what part
of Czechoslovakia
did you fight in?

274
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,467
Falkenau.

275
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,967
That's where the
last battle was fought.
Yeah, that's right.

276
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,100
And what outfit?

277
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,933
1St Division.

278
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:51,567
Oh, the 1st Division,
huh? The Big Red One.

279
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:55,667
Hey, didn't your outfit take
over the concentration camp
there and make the German

280
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,167
Civilians dress and
bury the Russian dead?

281
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,433
Yeah, funny, isn't it?

282
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:04,100
Going out of our way
to give those vodka
corpses a decent burial.

283
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,333
I wouldn't have done it.
Well, at the time we figured
they were our friends.

284
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,700
PIGALLE: Who knows who's
our friends? It's all so
crazy and mixed up.

285
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,433
We know one thing.
We know America
is our friend.

286
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:18,500
I don't see them fighting
over here. I mean,
in their own uniforms.

287
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,300
She's helping us where
we need help most.
A war costs money,

288
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,233
Especially this crazy one.
It's cost her a lot.

289
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,067
Say, Lucky Legs, you
think we'll run into one
of those Moi villages?

290
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,733
LUCKY: Mmm. One or two
will be in the way.

291
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,233
Moi? Hey, what's that?

292
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,433
It's Vietnamese
for "savage."

293
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,933
For savages
they certainly have been
taken advantage of.

294
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,700
The Commies promised
them rice and gave them guns.

295
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,533
They're like children.
They love to play soldier,
with red stars on their hats.

296
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,700
You know the Mois well?

297
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Well enough.

298
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,067
My mother was a Moi.
KRUGER: Oh, that's right.
I heard you were part Chinese.

299
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
You heard right.

300
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,667
The Moi believe
that this world is
the land of the dying,

301
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,400
And the next is
the land of the living.

302
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,467
Their religion is their
ancestors. They fill big
jars with rice wine

303
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,600
And pray that the spirits of
their ancestors will take
up residence in them.

304
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,867
In the jars?
Ancestors in the jars?
Yeah, that's right.

305
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,933
Ah!
How do you know?

306
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:21,067
I knew a Moi once
who ran short of funds.
You know what he did?

307
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,467
No.

308
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:25,900
He took one of those jars
and sold it with his
grandmother in it.

309
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,200
(SCOFFING)
No.

310
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,333
That's right.

311
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,233
(LAUGHING)

312
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,500
Say, you don't
look Chinese.

313
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,100
Everybody doesn't carry
their lives in their faces.

314
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,233
I like the idea of a
Fraulein scouting us.

315
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,200
ANDREADES: I don't.
MAN: You superstitious?

316
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,767
Nope.

317
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:56,400
But a lot of these
Vietnamese switch overnight
to the Communists,

318
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,900
Sell out their friends,

319
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,067
Even their families.

320
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,333
You think the Colonel
would've picked her

321
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:03,533
If there was a chance
she'd sell us out?

322
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:07,067
Why not? The Colonel
was a desperate man.

323
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,400
He'd take a chance
on anyone.

324
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,600
Can you see me walking
in a West Berlin beer parlor
with a Fraulein like that?

325
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,300
Who would believe
she's part Chinese?

326
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,233
You know...

327
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,300
They say there
was a rifle company
of Americans in Saigon.

328
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,967
KRUGER: Company.
The way I heard it,

329
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:28,833
It was a whole battalion.
And do you know what she did?
Shut up.

330
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,900
You're the first American
I saw without humor.

331
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,567
Shut up.

332
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,367
I'm just an old gossip
at heart, Sergeant.
I just said what I heard.

333
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:43,233
GAUMONT: You're too
sharp a soldier to swap
lies and believe them.

334
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:46,267
(LAUGHING)
I was thirteen when Hitler
turned my ears into sponges.

335
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:49,067
I guess all the propaganda
was squeezed out when
you joined the French.

336
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,967
KRUGER: French?
Still a uniform lover
at heart, eh, Kruger?

337
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:55,400
Ah, it's the only life
for me, even if I have
to die to live it.

338
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,567
Say, Goldie,
what part of America
are you from?

339
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,333
New York.

340
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,500
Yeah, I was with the
Hermann Goering Division.

341
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,800
Yeah, I know.

342
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,533
Your outfit
captured us in Sicily.

343
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,067
Yeah, I remember.

344
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,167
Say, why did you leave
your own army to fight
here in Indochina?

345
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:13,433
Well, what I started
out to do in Korea,
I didn't finish.

346
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,267
There are still a lot of
live Commies around.

347
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,400
(SNORING)

348
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,100
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

349
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,300
GOLDIE: Janszi... Janszi!

350
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:49,000
He's crazy! He jumped me!
What's the idea of hitting me?
I could've killed him!

351
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm sorry, Goldie.

352
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,800
I have that nightmare
all the time.

353
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,233
I always see
that Russian soldier
looking at me.

354
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,367
I...

355
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,067
(SOBBING)

356
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:05,367
I'm sorry.

357
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,533
Forget it.

358
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,367
I fight it all the time...

359
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,767
I fight...

360
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,733
I should have
remained in Hungary.

361
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:20,300
But I got sick of watching the
way they took my church over.

362
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:26,367
I was going to the
University of Budapest
when it happened.

363
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,067
I...

364
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
I... I'm sorry Goldie.

365
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,067
I told you, forget it.

366
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:37,567
I got drunk one night,
drunk with hate.

367
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,733
Just hate.

368
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:45,133
I followed that Russian
soldier down the alley
near the university.

369
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:48,933
Do you know how I killed him?

370
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,067
With my hands.

371
00:31:58,633 --> 00:31:59,767
My hands.

372
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,533
And I see him
all the time in my dreams.

373
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,200
And I kill him over
and over and over...

374
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,833
You screened
every man for this job,
didn't you, Captain?

375
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,200
Yes.

376
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
On a plane you
can tie up a blow-top,

377
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,900
But on an infantry job
you've got to do something
about it real fast.

378
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,667
What do you suggest,
Sergeant?

379
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:31,767
We can't leave him behind.
He'd be caught
and brainwashed.

380
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:37,333
We can't take him with us.
That Russian soldier might
visit him again.

381
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:40,400
BROCK: It's nothing
personal, Janszi.

382
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,933
We like you,
you know that,

383
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,900
But you're dangerous for us
to haul with us on this job.

384
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,233
You might kill
us all in our sleep.

385
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:55,067
You might take
a shot at Goldie or me
with our primers.

386
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,067
You know what that means?

387
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:05,567
We'd all be blown up,
because you're sick.

388
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,167
He's got to go.

389
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,967
GAUMONT: I guess you're right.

390
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,467
BROCK: I know I'm right.

391
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,100
Nobody fouls up this job.
Nobody.

392
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,067
You're wearing the bars.
Pick a man.

393
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,133
BROCK: The quicker you do it,

394
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:30,333
The faster we
get it over with.

395
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,733
You make sense,

396
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,367
But I'm not going to
give the order.

397
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:37,267
What do you mean?

398
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:40,933
You want to kill him?
Kill him, but it will have
to be your decision.

399
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,867
All right.
No! Wait a minute,
Sergeant...

400
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,733
Just...
Just a minute.

401
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,767
Just wait.

402
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,967
I... I'm not afraid to die.

403
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,900
That's why I volunteered
for this patrol.

404
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,800
But, to be killed
by one of you...

405
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,100
I promise,

406
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,500
I won't sleep.

407
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:11,200
I will keep quiet as a bird.

408
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,300
No more dreams.

409
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,367
No more nightmares.

410
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:19,600
I will keep awake
until the job is finished.

411
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,367
You have a knife.
Use it.

412
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
No.

413
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,200
I pass this time, Janszi.

414
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,667
The next time you
have a nightmare,
it'll be your last.

415
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Janszi.

416
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,533
If I were you,
I'd take some sleepin' pills.

417
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,367
It's all mined except
along the statues.

418
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,500
There's always a
guard stationed there
in contact with his unit.

419
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,833
I'll handle him.
Leung will signal
when to start.

420
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,367
Remember,
the safe ground
is only about that wide.

421
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,767
Brush against
those stone idols and you
won't blow up on a mine.

422
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,067
(LAUGHING)

423
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:58,800
You remember
Lieutenant Sinh Huy.

424
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,967
No, go ahead.

425
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:04,733
LUCKY: You're afraid
of Lieutenant Sinh Huy.

426
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,100
Have your own
little drink, there.

427
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,767
I'm gonna tell you
a story about
Lieutenant Sinh Huy.

428
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,867
It's nothing.
Nothing at all.

429
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,700
Mines.
Be careful.

430
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
LUCKY: Easy.

431
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,333
Easy now. Mines.

432
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,133
Careful.

433
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,467
We're surrounded by all
kinds of booby traps.

434
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,833
They keep changing
them every day.

435
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,433
How do you get through?

436
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:00,400
I find out from that
observation post.

437
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,133
What post?

438
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,333
There's a tree house
up there.

439
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,933
They can see movement
in all directions.

440
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,333
Oh, I can get
the information,
but night travel is out.

441
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:10,400
Too dangerous.

442
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,267
Daylight will be worse.
They will see us.

443
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,967
That's right, but
a dead guard can't see.

444
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll send a man up to
make sure he can't see.

445
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,967
You've been up
there many times?

446
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,133
Yes.

447
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,567
Alone?

448
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:28,533
Yes.

449
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,600
That you, Lucky?

450
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
LUCKY: Yes!

451
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:47,900
You alone?

452
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:50,467
No. I came with Leung
and some friends.

453
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:51,767
Bring a bottle.

454
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:53,300
How many do you want?

455
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,467
Oh, just enough for me.

456
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,733
Tell them I'll call down
when I find out.

457
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,600
Since when did you start
swamp-crawling at night?

458
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,333
Think I like it?
My orders were to hurry.

459
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
The Major again?

460
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,067
Mmm-hmm.
You jealous?

461
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,400
Everyone's jealous of him.

462
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,667
Is, uh...
Is number three clear?

463
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,433
No. Every path is wired.

464
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,067
Every one?

465
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,433
Yes,

466
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:11,433
But there's a small
bend about twenty yards
from here.

467
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:15,333
Oh? Where? Out there?
About twenty yards?

468
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:18,433
Yes, and if you
keep to the left side,
you'll make it.

469
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,200
But it's too risky
to try at night.

470
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,933
I won't be
relieved till morning.

471
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:29,667
I better tell
my cousin.

472
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:33,633
Leung?

473
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:35,300
LEUNG: Yes?

474
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,667
We'll have to wait
till morning.
Did you hear me?

475
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,333
LEUNG: Yes, I heard you.

476
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,667
(CHUCKLING)

477
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,700
You know, Leung
is a very good cousin.

478
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,367
(BOTH LAUGHING)

479
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:27,533
(GROANS)

480
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,067
The Captain told me to
spend the night here.

481
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,333
In case a Commie soldier
slipped up the ladder.

482
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,267
The Captain's a
frustrated matchmaker.

483
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,700
Yeah, I guess you're right.

484
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,833
I was captured.

485
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,867
They tried to brainwash me,
but I was a bad subject.

486
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,833
When it was over,
I was an exchange P.O.W.

487
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,967
You said
you were captured.

488
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:23,900
Yeah.

489
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,067
(CHUCKLING)

490
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:29,067
What's the matter,
don't you believe me?

491
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:34,133
You once told me
that no one could ever
really be captured.

492
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,367
If you want to die,
you'll kill, or be killed,

493
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,333
But if you want to live,
you'll surrender.

494
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,100
That's right.

495
00:42:42,533 --> 00:42:45,233
Give me one good reason
you had for wanting to live.

496
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,167
I was afraid to die.
It's as simple as that.

497
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,700
One thing about you, Brock.
You don't lie.

498
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,867
I don't have to.

499
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,467
Why'd you join the French?

500
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,500
Soldiering's my business.
Korea got cold and
Indochina got hot.

501
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,967
Are you really that
interested in fighting
for the French?

502
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:22,067
Sure. I don't particularly
like the Commies and France
was left holding the bag.

503
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,700
France.

504
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,533
There's only a handful
of French here, Brock.
There's millions of Chinese.

505
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:32,567
You came here to fight
for a Chinese baby.
Go on, admit it!

506
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,967
(SCOFFING)
You don't give a damn
about the French.

507
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:36,133
Go on! Admit it!

508
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:53,667
I'm learning
a lesson in hate
just watching you.

509
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,400
I'm too tired
to hate anymore.

510
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:03,367
It was all my
fault, not yours.

511
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:06,167
I'm really to blame.

512
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:10,633
You knew all about me,
but I didn't know
all about you.

513
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,900
Sure, you'd traveled all
over the world, but you
hadn't learned anything.

514
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,800
Not where it counts.

515
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,933
I should have investigated
your heart and your brain.

516
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,867
Should have seen you
weren't adjusted yet.

517
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,467
That you couldn't
face facts that
involve people.

518
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,900
(SIGHING)
Oh, you're tough.

519
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,933
You handle explosives,

520
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:43,833
But you're not tough
enough to handle life, Brock.

521
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,200
That's where I
made the mistake.

522
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,100
Everybody makes mistakes.

523
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Five years...

524
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:31,233
Five years is a long time
to think about one woman
every night.

525
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:35,067
(SIGHING)
Johnny, for me too.

526
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,300
Five years is a long time
to think about one man.

527
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,100
Every night
I talked to our son.

528
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:50,067
Half the time I was drunk,
but I talked to him.

529
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:54,267
I told him what I did.

530
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:57,967
I told him
when I was ashamed.

531
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:01,633
I asked him to forgive me.

532
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,667
I was luckier than you,
Johnny. I had someone
to talk to.

533
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,533
Someone who loves me.

534
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,633
Every night, Johnny.

535
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:18,933
I told him...

536
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:22,267
I told him...

537
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:24,333
How much I love his father.

538
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,200
(SIGHS) Oh, we'll
do our job, Johnny.

539
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:51,500
We'll go back together
and take our son
to America.

540
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,067
That's not what I meant.

541
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:02,433
What did you mean?

542
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,867
What do you think?

543
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,367
The wrong man was
killed in here tonight.

544
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:31,533
Tell the Captain
to send up a human being.

545
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:54,633
(SOBBING)

546
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,333
What's eating them?

547
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:53,967
They know she's your wife.

548
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,767
I thought a man's life was
private in the Legion.

549
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,767
I have a big mouth,
Sergeant.

550
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,933
When I joined
the leather-bellies,
I never figured the Legion

551
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,200
Was an old lady
with an itchy tongue.

552
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,267
Time changes everything,
Sergeant, even the Corps.

553
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:09,067
The Legionnaire of today
is not fighting

554
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:11,900
For a few centimes,
a bottle and a woman.

555
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,900
This time the
Foreign Legion mercenary

556
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:18,567
Is not fighting for money,
nor for the French
government alone.

557
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:23,933
This time they're fighting
for the whole Western world,
against a common enemy.

558
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:28,733
So it is only natural
that time will change
the interests of the men.

559
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,533
They like Lucky Legs.
They know of your son.

560
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,133
They know you are
ashamed of him.

561
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:39,067
They just don't like you.

562
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:41,400
Look out!

563
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:55,967
I don't feel so good.

564
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,633
Your back's broken.

565
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,533
I've seen broken backs.

566
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:07,100
There's nothing anybody
can do about it. Huh?

567
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,433
Nothing.

568
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:12,667
What're you all waiting for?

569
00:50:13,867 --> 00:50:16,000
Move out. Move out.

570
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,433
We have to wait.

571
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,700
Why?

572
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,300
We can't bury you alive.

573
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,167
I don't like for people
to watch me die.

574
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:31,333
We don't like it, either.

575
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:53,867
She's got manners, that one.

576
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:58,033
She's a wonderful
woman, Brock.

577
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,467
What she ever saw in you?
(GURGLING)

578
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:07,067
Ever been to Greece?

579
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,167
No.

580
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
You?

581
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,633
No.

582
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,900
I remember when
my wife went crazy.

583
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:29,300
I remember when
she died, crazy.

584
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,667
(RAGGED BREATHING)

585
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:39,467
I'm sorry I'm taking
such a long time to die.

586
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,367
We're in no hurry.

587
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,133
Let there be a heaven,

588
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:53,267
For it would kill me to have
to come back here again.

589
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,100
I'm all mixed up, Lia.

590
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,567
I figured you'd understand.

591
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:45,467
I mean, what I told you
up there in the tree house.

592
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:54,067
I could've lied to you.
I could've filled your head
with lies.

593
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,600
I could have said
that I wanted the kid,

594
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,600
That I'd take him
to the States with me.

595
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,367
I could've told you
all those things.

596
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:07,067
But I didn't, Lia,
I didn't.

597
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:13,900
Not when I... Not when I
can't feel anything for him.

598
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:20,367
You mean...
You mean even now,
after you've seen him?

599
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:22,100
You feel nothing?

600
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,367
You're the only person that
ever made me feel ashamed.

601
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:35,067
Ashamed of my mother,
my race, myself.

602
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,600
I know I'm different.

603
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,067
I know the difference
between me and my sisters,
and my cousins,

604
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,667
But I never felt
ashamed of it.

605
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:45,767
I told you he might look
Chinese, didn't I?

606
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:49,133
But you said it wouldn't
make any difference, as long
as the baby were healthy.

607
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:50,467
Didn't you?

608
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:52,200
Yeah.

609
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:57,400
But it's different when
it really happens to you.

610
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,967
I never figured it would be
such a one-sided birth.

611
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:03,333
There's, there's nothing...

612
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:07,733
No, there's nothing
Brock about him,
except half his blood.

613
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,833
Otherwise he's like
millions of Chinese babies.

614
00:54:12,933 --> 00:54:16,267
But I don't want him
wearing a grenade
when he's ten.

615
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:19,967
I don't want him carrying
a gun when he's fifteen.

616
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:23,267
I don't want him killed,
or made into a Communist.

617

Next time you fall
in love with one of us,

618
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:30,933
Get it in writing
your child will be born
with straight eyes.

619
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:38,633
You know why they call me
Pigalle? Because I was
a gendarme in Paris.

620
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,567
A traffic cop,
that's what I was.

621
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:44,367
My station was
Place Pigalle.

622
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:48,900
You know, the one
you Gis call Pig Alley.

623
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:52,933
There I stood all day long,
king of the street,

624
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:56,567
Stopping that car,
waving this one to go.

625
00:54:56,667 --> 00:55:01,067
Stop! Go! Stop! Go!

626
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:08,133
I blew my whistle till
my lips could not enjoy
a glass of wine.

627
00:55:08,233 --> 00:55:11,067
It was driving me crazy.

(CHUCKLES)

629
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,600
I think I need
some fresh air.

630
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:34,300
And so, I found myself
directing my family
like traffic.

631
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,733
I was telling my wife
at night when to eat,
when not to eat,

632
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,867
When to walk,
when not to walk,
when to, uh...

633
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,067
I was losing my mind.

634
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,367
So I joined the Legion
to find it.

635

For the first time,

636
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,567
People are telling me
when to stop and when to go.

637
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,400
For the first time,
I am happy.

638
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,167
My wife is happy.
I am not there to nag her.

639
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:08,167
My children are happy.
I am not there to direct them.

640
00:56:08,267 --> 00:56:11,700

the way to live!

pounds of explosives
and fifty primers.

a weasel like you.

Don't bypass it,
give it to me straight.

Lucky Legs
and that son of yours.
Yeah? In what way?

690
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:47,333
I always wanted a kid, Brock.

691
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:51,867
When my wife was told
we couldn't have one,
we put in papers to adopt one.

692
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:55,800
But my wife got sick,

693
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,533
Eaten up inside,
not bein' able to have one.
Just eaten up.

694
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,733
I watched her go down
to 75 pounds.

695
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:14,900
She died feeling sorry for me.
That's how much she knew
I wanted a kid.

696

When I learned you
walked out on yours...

697
01:05:19,067 --> 01:05:21,833
Let me tell you
something, Brock.

698
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:25,900
I've belted through two wars,
and I'm comin' out of
this one. You know why?

699
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:30,300
'Cause I got a reason.
I'll get my release when
they know why I want out.

I'll tell you one thing.

Lucky Legs is going
through hell for your son.

702
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,733
And if something
happens to her on this job,
he'll still get to the States,

703
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:44,433
Even if I have to crawl
all the way back with him
on my back.

It's smarter to let
them wander around

won't bomb again.

Our situation is too
flexible for that.
We bomb everywhere.

believe how you can talk
so indifferently about

hate any kind of brutality.

I remember when you hated
the Communists.

774
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:53,100
That was a stupid thing
to say in front of her.

775

Fortunately, she's deaf.

01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:57,867
Don't you ever say that
to me again
in front of anyone.

01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,367
Of course I hate killing,

778

But if France wins I'll be
a school teacher again.

the times, Lia.

When the Communists win,

782
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,533

or perhaps even Moscow.

You'd have come with me
if you hadn't listened to

790
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,233
I told you then it
was all a farce.

But, no...

792
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:40,067
He wouldn't buy you
for 30 dollars.

793
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,933
Not your beautiful
American soldier.
He really loved you.

794
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,500
He wanted your children.
He was going to take
you to America.

wonderful man, Lia.

The day I can report
directly to Moscow,

801
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:05,600
Instead of through Peking...

802
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,733
That's the day I'll be
in line to command the
Viet Minh Politburo.

803
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,867
Maybe you're right.

804
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:14,467
Maybe I'm too blind to
see what's happening.

805
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,067
Maybe I should bring
the boy here.

806
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,933
It's the only sensible
thing to do.

807
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,067
Lia...

808
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,567
We're both half-castes.

809
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,867
But I'm more fortunate
than you. I have Chinese
characteristics. You don't.

810
01:13:30,633 --> 01:13:32,900
Just picture yourself
the wife of a general.

811
01:13:33,633 --> 01:13:35,067
Your son safe every night.

812
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:36,533
Playing every day.

813
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:38,500
His mind being developed
so that he can step
into my shoes

814
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,067
And protect the people.

815
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:44,067
I could have married
many times, Lia.

816
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:53,500
I love only one woman, Lia.

817
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:56,900
Please let me
send for him.

818
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,333
Oh, I don't know.

819
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:03,533
You'll know when you see
what's taking place.

820
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:06,667
All those mountains are
laced with tunnels.

821
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:08,700
And the French are
losing the war,

822
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,867
Because they don't know
which tunnel is our arsenal.

823
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,567
I'll show you why it's
logical you should marry me.

824
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,467
There are enough bombs
and shells in here

825
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,667
To guarantee your son
a safe life with me.

826
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:15,267
One of these may be
the one to kill him.

827
01:15:15,367 --> 01:15:17,567
That's entirely up to you.

828
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,200
It's a butcher shop
before the slaughter.

829
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,400
Call it butchery.

830
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,200
When it's all over
you'll call it virtue.

831
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,833
How can you sleep nights?

832
01:15:27,933 --> 01:15:30,200
It's all according to
your point of view.

833
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,133
You get caught in a
political upheaval,
you're hanged as a traitor.

834
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:35,533
But lead
a successful revolt

835
01:15:35,633 --> 01:15:37,533
And future generations
will worship you

836
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,300
As the father
of their country.

837
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,333
Can you argue with
all this, Lia?

838
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,633
No.

839
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:47,500
No, it's...
It's horrifying.

840
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,367
And dramatically final.

841
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:53,367
The difference between
failure and success

842
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:56,067
Is in doing a thing
nearly right,

843
01:15:56,133 --> 01:15:57,633
And doing it
exactly right.

844
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,833
If all this fails to
convince you that you'd
be marrying the winner,

845
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,667
I can only
catalog you as a fool.

846
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,900
And file your son
as a casualty.

847
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:11,700
Lia...

848
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,600
It's said that the
Book of Life

849
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,500
Begins with a man and
a woman in a garden and
ends with Revelations.

850
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,700
This is my kind of
garden, Lia.

851
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,667
And my kind
of revelations.

852
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:26,100
With me you'd not
only live long,

853
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,500
But you'd live!

854
01:16:28,867 --> 01:16:31,633
Let me think
about it.

855
01:16:31,733 --> 01:16:34,433
The longer you take
to think, the shorter
your boy's life.

856
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:39,267
I'll make up my
mind tonight.

857
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:41,367
I've been praying for
this moment a long time.

858
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,633
Hmm. You?

859
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:45,567
Prayed?

860
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,833
There's moments when
my soul is on its knees.

861
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,533
LUCKY: The guard at
the Buddha is relieved
every two hours.

862
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:27,300
He's been on duty
for twenty minutes.

863
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:30,067
This is the shrine
entrance to the tunnel.

864
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,067
Two guards here.
GAUMONT: What about
their relief?

865
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,767
They've got one hour to go.

866
01:17:33,867 --> 01:17:37,200
At the far end
are five guards.
I'll handle them.

867
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,067
Leung will let me know
the minute you've finished.

868
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,833
The Colonel was right in
picking you for this job.

869
01:17:41,933 --> 01:17:44,400
It didn't take you long
to locate those bombs.

870
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,200
It wasn't hard.

871
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,233
No. I guess it wasn't.

872
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,167

You'll get a medal for it,
Brock.

873
01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:55,800
And I'll get what I want.

Yes.

875

Keep close behind me.

876
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,233
There may be a guard not
interested in my legs.

877
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:05,067
Lia.

878
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:06,800
Wait.
GAUMONT: Is something wrong?

879
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:08,867
Yeah, me.

880
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,067
Lia...

881
01:18:18,267 --> 01:18:20,933
Lia, I never said I was
sorry for what I did.

882
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:25,867
I never apologized.

883
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:28,833
I never asked you
to forgive me.

I want our kid.
I want him the way he is.

my wife again?

to hear for the last
thousand years!

one thing wrong.

What?

897
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,767
Well...

The way he feels,
he'd never marry us again.

divorced me!

but you...

You were ashamed of me,

came from the Major.
