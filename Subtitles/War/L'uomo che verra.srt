1
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,275
Apple, lemon, mandarin,

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,598
strawberry, banana, orange!

3
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,198
THE MAN WHO WILL COME

4
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,875
Martina! Look at your dress,
it's all creased!

5
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,798
You can't go to church like that!

6
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,870
DECEMBER 1943

7
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,308
Martina,
you shouldn't have been born.

8
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,909
You should have been born
into a family of masters.

9
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,236
Come here, get on this.

10
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,629
Take it off.

11
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,199
Try this one on.

12
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,593
That was my dress!

13
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,950
It's nicer than the one you've got.

14
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,950
My girl, I don't understand you
and your superior attitude.

15
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,596
You stayed away for so long
and you never wrote home.

16
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,712
No one can read here,
what's the point?

17
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm glad you're back,
but with that coat and that dress...

18
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,876
what'll people say?

19
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,639
I won't be a maid for long.

20
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,399
What'll you do then?
You'll end up being a prostitute!

21
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,393
So all the women who go to the city
are maids or prostitutes?

22
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,671
Just don't come home pregnant!

23
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,199
Who'll put baby Jesus there?
- Me! - Me! - Me!

24
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,392
- Martina, give him to me!
- You can't do it, he'll die.

25
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,309
- It's her mother's fault, not hers.
- Give him to me! - Give him to me!

26
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,230
Enough!
I'll do it. Tomorrow, when it's time.

27
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,316
See you in church tomorrow!

28
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,073
Hey, dumb girl!

29
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,476
Has your belly grown?

30
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,275
- Witch!
- What's in your tummy, a baby?

31
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,355
You dog's daughter!

32
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,074
Witch!

33
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,073
What do you think you'll find there?
Everyone's hungry.

34
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,669
On Christmas Eve
you shouldn't do certain things.

35
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,678
You want it more than me.

36
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,397
You want it, you always love tojoke.

37
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
Go easy with that bread!

38
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,633
If you do lots of hours,
do they pay more?

39
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,274
A day's work is a day's work.

40
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,871
Whether you're a farmer
or a bricklayer and get paid daily,

41
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,718
it's always work,
the money's the same.

42
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,673
Uncle, you're wrong. I'm right.

43
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,518
- We have to go.
- Go where?

44
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,030
If we go to Bologna, you'll get
more money for a day's work.

45
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,231
And even more in Milan.

46
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,431
And if you go to America,
you'll get whatever you want.

47
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,711
And if you work seventy hours?

48
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,797
You always use silly examples!

49
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,712
What did you do?
I'll speak to you later.

50
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,796
We're here to celebrate
and there's no food.

51
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,713
Ask God Almighty why
you were born poor and ignorant.

52
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,872
If we're ignorant,
ignorant we'll remain.

53
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,714
You should've been a priest
if you wanted to eat!

54
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,271
"Blue blossom of benevolence,
bless my mom and dad."

55
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,594
"Beautiful blonde baby
you lie in a straw bed

56
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,472
yet you are king of the world."

57
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,193
"I want to cover you with kisses."

58
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,517
"I give you my heart, my Lord,

59
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,677
but with the angels
who surround you in heaven

60
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,395
bring me their love
and make me good like them."

61
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,752
"Make mom and dad happy, Lord."

62
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,830
Move up.

63
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,835
Feel how cold you are.

64
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,434
You know what the biggest sin is?

65
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,392
What do you mean?

66
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,115
Is it worse to kill...

67
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,788
or to make love?

68
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,868
- What makes you ask that?
- I thought you knew.

69
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,108
When you make love it's nice...

70
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,630
If it's a sin, that's a shame!

71
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,077
And if another man touches you?

72
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,399
Are you the sinner...
or is he?

73
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,511
I don't know, you should
ask the priest these things.

74
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,951
Are you expecting?

75
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,711
No...

76
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,878
but I think I'm in love.

77
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,955
I've come about the farm.

78
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,959
No, nothing's changed.

79
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,390
The law stipulates
that you cannot leave the farm

80
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,991
without the approval
of the local Fascist group.

81
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,791
The work force?
How many children do you have?

82
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,389
You've been around the world
for work,

83
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,718
you should be grateful that
they're still giving you the land.

84
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,357
- Must I fill in another form?
- You farmers are stubborn!

85
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,074
Only God commands me...
and that's enough!

86
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,999
Why are you here?
You're nothing but a beast!

87
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,555
They were dropping bombs,
it was mayhem. I ran away.

88
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,832
The fascists already came here
looking for deserters.

89
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,392
We need to keep moving,
it's going to rain.

90
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,479
Why must we stay here all day
when we have so much to do?

91
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,039
Don't worry. Lf you think about
the debts, the grapes will go sour.

92
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,878
It's the way you do things
that changes things.

93
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,239
Calmly, patiently...

94
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,313
- Master. - Good morning, Armando.
I'm accompanying these Germans.

95
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,868
They want wine, I've run out.

96
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,471
Lena, take them home.
Get some eggs and wine.

97
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,711
I'm glad, master,
that you have new friends.

98
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,236
You know I gave to your friends,

99
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,795
but if I have these,
I must keep them happy.

100
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,675
Why aren't they at home, looking
after their families and their land?

101
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,952
- We've got enough worries.
- History is full of wars.

102
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,276
- History? Who cares about history
and who makes it?

103
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,869
All those that kill people and steal
from the poor become important.

104
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,428
Is that history?

105
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,234
Then they recite the words
of Jesus Christ!

106
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,558
- I didn't mean you.

107
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,914
You shouldn't talk like that, because
I can understand you, but them...

108
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,953
Let them catch me then
and kill me, but enough!

109
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,753
They can't kill me twice!

110
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,313
I can smell snow.

111
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,515
When night falls at sea,
it's dark...

112
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,120
and you can hear sounds...

113
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,676
The sea is full of giant fish,
as big as houses,

114
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,597
with huge mouths...

115
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,349
as they chase ships
and try to eat them.

116
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,960
And they want to eat us too.

117
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,798
Everyone prays on the ship,

118
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,316
but every so often
a giant wave arrives

119
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,036
and takes the bad men away.

120
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,311
And the fish?
They eat them!

121
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,078
At the end of the voyage,
we arrived at a port in Sardinia.

122
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,236
We took the train from there

123
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,875
then we walked across mountains
like ours

124
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,072
where there were only shepherds
and brigands.

125
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,236
How many trees did you cut down?

126
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,269
The elders did that,
I was too young.

127
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,153
I was just a helper, like him.

128
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,518
But I worked all the same.
Day and night, like the others.

129
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,759
I'd make polenta, fetch the water...
I even kept watch.

130
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,315
Sometimes, it seemed like
the trees were watching me

131
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,113
and telling me about their life.

132
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,958
And then...

133
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,398
Good evening. I'm a merchant, I can't
go back to Bologna with this snow.

134
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,472
- Come in.
- Thanks.

135
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,393
If I could stay the night...
Wherever you want...

136
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,631
I don't mind, even with the lad.

137
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,673
- The stable's big.
- Thank you.

138
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,070
Sit down.

139
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,996
I can pay for the bother.

140
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,636
I was taught that you don't
ask money from those who need it.

141
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,592
You have to be careful round here,

142
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,076
I've heard there are rebels here too.

143
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,078
On a night like this,
even the rebels feel the cold.

144
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,591
Poppet!

145
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,716
Poppet!

146
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,469
I've got some candies.

147
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,989
What's your name?

148
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,548
Aren't you cold?

149
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,518
Here...

150
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,078
There you are.
One and two.

151
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,396
You're a pretty girl.

152
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,950
Poppet!

153
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,232
They sent a spy.
A guy from Vergato.

154
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,913
While everyone was asleep
in the refuge

155
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,520
and the Wolf was keeping watch.

156
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,075
This guy, I don't even know
how he did it.

157
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,954
He pulled out a knife
and stabbed him in the stomach.

158
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,313
Then he jumped on me,

159
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,592
but I woke up
and moved away.

160
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,870
It was dark...

161
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,675
The Wolf was on the floor,
yelping like a beast.

162
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,555
The guy looked mad,
he was stabbing whatever he could.

163
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,956
I didn't know what was going on.

164
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,389
I don't know how Fonso did it.

165
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,948
He pulled out a gun

166
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,073
and shot that piece of shit
right in the face.

167
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,796
This is our land, we were born here
and we've always lived here.

168
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:10,039
- Why should we let the Germans command
us now? - They think we're beasts.

169
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,119
You know what? I've never seen
what they do anywhere in the world.

170
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,311
They do the opposite
of what we were taught to do

171
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,390
What shall we do then? Put
on a uniform and take up arms too?

172
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,954
We'd become like them.

173
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,710
We are the same as you.
Come with us.

174
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,558
- We have to do something - You're
right, but this is real war.

175
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,119
And a real war has to be fought with
guns, weapons... You need the works!

176
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,473
- It's not a game. - We have to think
about what we want to leave our children.

177
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,959
The spies come up here too.

178
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,113
You've got some courage.

179
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,153
- You could be team leader.
- No.

180
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,959
Go ahead and shoot,

181
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,959
you may as well...

182
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,479
I don't want to command.

183
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,913
Let me do what I want, but I don't
want to command, I'm not capable.

184
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,478
If you want mines planted,
I'm not scared, I've been a soldier.

185
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,069
But I don't want to shoot.

186
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,670
No one uses their real name here,
you have to choose another name.

187
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,317
Because if you're caught,
the less you know the better.

188
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,876
You have to respect
all of your companions

189
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,708
and don't get any political ideas
in your head.

190
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,469
You know why you're here?
I'll tell you why.

191
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,117
You're here because back there...
There are fascists and Germans.

192
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,709
But this is your home,
and that of your grandparents.

193
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,638
And it's where your family lives.

194
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,751
Remember that

195
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,511
and when you see a German,
don't run away, fight him.

196
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,633
We don't have much time,
we have to be quick.

197
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,395
It's still warm.

198
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,709
Try it, it's nice and sweet.

199
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,990
Are you scared that pig's ghost
will come for you at night?

200
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,553
You can't even kill a pig in peace
anymore!

201
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,037
They've put a tax on pork,
damn them!

202
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,750
They'll put a tax
on farting too soon!

203
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,432
Be quiet, Saint Anthony
is watching you.

204
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,677
<i>My family are farmers.</i>

205
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,599
<i>There's only a few of them</i>
<i>buta baby brother's arriving.</i>

206
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,517
<i>They work the land for a man</i>
<i>who has a beautiful horse.</i>

207
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,633
<i>But my father says that</i>
<i>he takes too much of the harvest</i>

208
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,592
<i>and that he's still a master</i>

209
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,714
<i>Sometimes the Germans come up</i>
<i>to buy things.</i>

210
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,072
<i>They can'tspeak Italian</i>
<i>and I don't know why they come here</i>

211
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,358
<i>... when they could be at home</i>
<i>with their children...</i>

212
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,472
<i>Because they have them too.</i>

213
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,910
<i>The Germans have arms and they shoot</i>
<i>the enemy, I don't know who that is.</i>

214
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,478
<i>I heard that they're at war against</i>
<i>the Allies but I've never seen them.</i>

215
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,516
<i>Then there are the rebels,</i>

216
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,236
<i>who fight because they say</i>
<i>the Germans must leave.</i>

217
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,629
<i>The rebels have arms too.</i>

218
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:31,071
<i>Many of them speak our language</i>
<i>and dress like us.</i>

219
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,630
<i>Their chief is called Wolf.</i>

220
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,559
<i>Everyone fears him,</i>
<i>but they all care about him.</i>

221
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,720
<i>My Uncle Dino cares about him too</i>
<i>and says we must help him.</i>

222
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,150
<i>My father says we must help him too,</i>

223
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,153
<i>but that he has the land</i>
<i>and can'tgo with them.</i>

224
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,395
There are fascists too...

225
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,877
"There are fascists too that come up
And they speak our language too."

226
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,710
"But they shout and say that the rebels
are bandits who should be killed."

227
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,356
"This is what I've understood:
Lots of people want to kill others,

228
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,312
but I don't understand why."

229
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,950
Are you mad to write such things?

230
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,880
Forgive us.

231
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,954
Don't worry,
but you'd better burn it.

232
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,949
Yes, thank you.

233
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,230
Why do you want to go dancing?

234
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,114
We're always working, slaving away,
I'm begging you.

235
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,072
I said no so it's no!

236
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,156
They always do the same round,
the tree, the roof then the chimney.

237
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,471
Wine... good wine.

238
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,078
Pity, we could've had some bread.

239
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,636
It needs baking.

240
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,879
Eggs and wine.

241
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,638
I'll see if there are some more eggs.

242
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,917
No! Martina, you'd better go.

243
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,316
We're lacking lots of things
in these times.

244
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,715
- Nice hands.
- Sorry. I'm married.

245
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,910
And I'm pregnant too.

246
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,599
You certainly don't lack courage.

247
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,197
Beniamina! Maria!

248
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,156
Why are you here?
Shame on you! Go home.

249
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,112
We'll deal with you later.

250
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,755
Go home, Martina

251
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,154
Go on, go home.

252
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,556
In the name of God,
have mercy.

253
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,435
This is what happens
when people don't respect rules.

254
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,311
Father...

255
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,598
you are not leading
your flock along the right path.

256
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,919
- I'll go there and take them down all
the same. - I told you it's forbidden.

257
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,478
If it's forbidden then follow me
and shoot me.

258
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,555
One moment...

259
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,036
One moment, I'll give you some candies.
Here, one for you...

260
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,311
Wait...
Don't go near the donkey.

261
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,473
Wait...

262
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,989
Come in, I've got some wine
and need some company.

263
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,349
I'm coming, Armando.

264
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,312
Who's this?
You're more beautiful than ever.

265
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,995
Forgive her, she's become wild.

266
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,160
She hasn't spoken since her newborn
brother died in her arms.

267
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,637
You could send her to the institute
for the deaf in Bologna.

268
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,114
May I?

269
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,793
I didn't forget about you,
I told you.

270
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,710
- I've come for the baskets.
- Thanks, to our good fortune.

271
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,519
My cousin came here because
Bologna's too dangerous now.

272
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,596
They keep dropping bombs

273
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,349
and they've issued a proclamation
calling up soldiers.

274
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,914
If they catch me, they'll kill me.

275
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,078
He could pay to stay here
and do some work in return.

276
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,511
Many men hide in the tunnels
made for the Direttissima.

277
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,949
I've not come here to hide.

278
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,356
If there's a war to be fought,
I want to be on the winning side.

279
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,278
It's impossible to know who'll win.

280
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,312
The winners are those
who remain alive.

281
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,551
They've made a group here...
that lot.

282
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,795
How can I meet them?

283
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,598
Go into the woods. If they're there,
sooner or later you'll find them.

284
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,790
- They're coming too. - How much
money will they give? - I don't know.

285
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,789
You should tell your employers
that they must pay us.

286
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,468
You're full of lice.

287
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,753
Isn't your head itchy?

288
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,711
- We'll need to shave your hair off.
- No, use some oil.

289
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,352
You've come to teach us things?
Oil? Oil costs money!

290
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,633
Good morning.

291
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,871
Here...

292
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,515
- My mother.
- How do you do? - Nice to meet you.

293
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,869
- It's not as nice as your house...

294
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,675
Don't worry. It'll be fine,
we've come here to be safe.

295
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,154
They keep bombing Bologna,

296
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,953
we can't trust anyone anymore.

297
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,072
I hope you'll be happy here.

298
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,796
We tidied up the room a bit.

299
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,274
Don't worry,
we've come to be safe.

300
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,790
If we don't help each other,
in these times...

301
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,719
My niece and my sister-in-law.

302
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,194
- Hello, I'm Giovanni Bugamelli.
- Nice to meet you.

303
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,676
This is my wife.
- Hello, I'm Clara. - How do you do?

304
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,111
- These are our children.
- Laura and Guglielmo.

305
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,276
I brought something for you.

306
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,039
You can't even get anything
on the black market anymore

307
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,629
What do they expect us to do?

308
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,994
- Here.
- Thank you.

309
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,359
It's beautiful, thank you!

310
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,517
It's for the baby
you're expecting.

311
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,031
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

312
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,794
- One times eight?
- Eight.

313
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,276
- Two times eight?
- Sixteen.

314
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,596
- Three times eight?
- Twenty-four.

315
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,077
- You stink!
- 4 x 8? - You stink, how gross!

316
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,275
Enough!

317
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,958
Martina!

318
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,356
Go to the back
so they won't bother you.

319
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,554
Come on, don't be upset.
They're all idiots.

320
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,554
Why don't you say something to me?

321
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,836
Come on!

322
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,359
Why won't you talk to me?

323
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:06,191
"I'm going... to have...
a little brother."

324
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,468
Are you happy?

325
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,149
But they'll ignore you.

326
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:28,672
"I'm going to have... lots."

327
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,598
How do you know?

328
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,757
What is it?

329
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,712
A parachute?

330
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,951
Mr. Bugamelli! Madam!

331
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,392
They'll be in church with the women!
Hurry, you go too!

332
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,238
What are you doing in there?
They're coming!

333
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,874
We're all going to Casaglia,
the men will go into the woods.

334
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,071
- You'd better go into the woods.
- Where?

335
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,554
Into the woods, I'll take you.

336
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,873
Into the woods, let's go!

337
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,077
Let's go to the church,
they won't bomb that.

338
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,790
Go.

339
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,994
I can't stay in here.
I'll go out, onto a tree.

340
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,156
- Wait!
- Don't do it!

341
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,040
They're coming from all sides.

342
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,834
The partisans will defend us, right?

343
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,312
- Well? - The partisans
are hiding and they're getting shot.

344
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,990
They're sending them back.

345
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,033
Gnac, Penna...

346
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,629
Tell the other groups
that we're leaving.

347
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,871
- What?
- What are you going to do?

348
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,388
Why are you staying here?

349
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,954
To prepare a fire for the Germans?

350
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,638
Lots of them will arrive.

351
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,478
We have to do what the allied
secret service said,

352
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,398
strike then leave.

353
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,117
Come on!

354
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,710
The soldiers!

355
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,956
The Germans are coming!

356
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,958
Come on, let's go!

357
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,397
What are you doing?

358
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,756
We'll starve now!

359
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,271
Tell me, where are they?
Where are they?

360
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,231
Talk to me!

361
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,869
Where were you?

362
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,639
Where were you?

363
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,872
Let Mary be my mother,
Saint Joseph my father

364
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,708
let the saints be my relatives
and may you be safe.

365
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,878
- Come on, Lena, rest a while.
- There's still a lot to do.

366
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,469
- The weather's about to change.
- We can do this later.

367
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,630
Sit down here.

368
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,348
We'll get some water.

369
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,235
Come on, we'll make it.

370
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,596
Come here.

371
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,916
It's nothing.

372
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,798
Look after it,
it's all I've got.

373
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,231
Thank you, for the job too.

374
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,957
Don Fornasini, my wife
would like you to baptise our child.

375
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,633
It's best the doctor sees him,
it's a deep wound.

376
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,236
Why split you up? You're mad.
What'll you resolve then?

377
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,510
Wolf is incapable of commanding.

378
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,319
Sugano left because Wolf
doesn't want to know about politics.

379
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,113
You can't stay here.

380
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,994
Keep this paper, after the war...

381
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,953
What'll we do with it?
We can't eat paper.

382
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,471
First they take our cattle,
now you're taking the rest.

383
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,796
In the war, you need to know
which side to be on.

384
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,709
Anyway,
we're on your side.

385
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,631
Lena, got any salt?

386
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,830
The Germans!

387
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,479
Lena, got any salt?

388
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,431
I'll bring you some.

389
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,629
Good morning. Did you want
some salt? This is all we have.

390
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,233
Why are you here?

391
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,835
Don Fornasini sent me,
I got here during the night.

392
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,031
- Did you come about the roof job?
- Yes.

393
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,116
Good.

394
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,310
I brought a hen.

395
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,075
Turn around.

396
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,314
What is it, Martina?

397
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,794
What's happened?

398
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,476
Martina, what is it?

399
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,590
Do you need to confess?

400
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,076
What's it like?

401
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,629
What's in there?

402
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,355
A whole world.

403
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,353
Put this on. There.

404
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,470
Pull it down.

405
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,397
Stop.

406
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,278
Don't move, I'll adjust it there.

407
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,674
You're so beautiful, Martina.

408
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,954
You look like a bride.

409
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,915
Give your brother a caress.

410
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,996
Is your little brother sleeping?

411
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,594
Why are you wearing
your communion dress?

412
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,995
Take it off after.

413
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,914
It's going to rain.
Go get some firewood.

414
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,157
And see if you can find some apples.

415
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,110
Did something happen to the baby?

416
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,629
Come with me!

417
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,472
Come on, move it! The Germans!

418
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,311
They're coming.

419
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,631
We have to go, the Germans are coming.

420
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,873
Again?

421
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,309
Hurry, we have to get out!

422
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,319
We have to go, the Germans are coming.

423
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,797
Lena can't go anywhere,
I'll stay with her.

424
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,753
- Are you sure? - Go to
the woods, they'll spare us.

425
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,598
Martina has to go to the function
at the school in Cerpiano.

426
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,599
Let's go, Martina.
Let's go. Martina!

427
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,837
- Come on, Martina!
- Let's go, Martina. - Go with auntie.

428
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,235
Martina, let's go!

429
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,151
It's slippery here.

430
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,832
Take this.

431
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,550
Stay calm, don't worry.

432
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,552
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

433
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,112
Stay calm...
Don't worry.

434
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,073
The young men must go to the woods,
women and children in the church.

435
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,111
Stay calm.

436
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,432
You go down to Cerpiano,
I'll arrive for the Angel service.

437
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,711
- Yes. - All right.
- All right. - Go, Martina.

438
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,952
- Guglielmo, come here!
- Leave him, he's with the children.

439
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,230
Dai che andiamo dentro noi.

440
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,798
- We're praying.
- You have to come with us.

441
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,354
Now! Come on, now!

442
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,193
All hell broke loose in Cadotto.
They made a surprise attack on us.

443
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,710
- Let me see.
They're taking them away.

444
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,313
- Filthy partisans!
- Are you blind?

445
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,069
Can't you see we're all women,
children and elderly people?

446
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,475
- What partisans?
- The baby!

447
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:47,399
We've got nothing to do with it,
we're from Bologna.

448
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,954
You see? We even have
something for you.

449
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,838
I'll be back.

450
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,520
She looks just like my wife.

451
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,396
Is the baby yours?

452
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:53,314
Mom! Mom! Mom!

453
01:37:55,240 --> 01:38:00,360
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

454
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:06,794
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

455
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,075
Holy Mother!

456
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,908
Mom! Hurry, give me a hand.

457
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,956
Holy Mother! What have
they done to you? Give me the baby.

458
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,560
Come inside.

459
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:43,751
Give it to me.

460
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,631
Give me your foot.

461
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,551
Good girl.

462
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,155
Women, children...

463
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:14,354
This morning, in San Martino,
they found another forty of them.

464
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:19,838
We buried them all together,
we couldn't take risks.

465
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,872
I asked around,
but no one saw him.

466
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:29,393
He'll be hiding in the woods.
You'll see, many men will have escaped.

467
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:27,949
We all are...
what they taught us to be.

468
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,633
It's a matter of education.

469
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,118
I don't think the young lady
knows how to dance.

470
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,355
Don't you agree?

471
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:41,358
Those aren't the steps.

472
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,920
Come away from there.
