1
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,682
THE WAR IS OVER

2
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,588
You made it.

3
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,426
Once again you see
the hill of Biriatou.

4
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:17,196
Once again you have that stale,
anxious taste of crossing the border.

5
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,234
You drove all night.

6
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,673
Your mouth is dry from too little sleep
and too much tobacco.

7
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:28,679
Once again you cross this border
in the shimmering early-morning light.

8
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:33,784
The sun rises behind you
over the Elizondo peaks.

9
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,288
Once again, you'll make it over.

10
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,994
It's all right.
You'll make your train.

11
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,627
All night I was afraid
we might break down.

12
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,494
But there was no reason.
I had the car checked.

13
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,000
An obsession.
You know how it is.

14
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,503
At night, the stretch
between Burgos and Miranda...

15
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,074
miles of desert around us--

16
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:34,045
No offense, but service stations in
your country leave a lot to be desired.

17
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,776
I didn't dare push the car too hard.
I was afraid.

18
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,916
If it weren't for you,
I would have played tourist today.

19
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,387
A good meal
in a seafood restaurant.

20
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,254
Crabe in a hot sauce
with a nice white wine.

21
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,523
Or roast pig at Bottine's,
behind the Plaza Mayor.

22
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,622
And in the afternoon,
a bullfight, of course.

23
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,097
I generally don't get the time
to see the towns I go to.

24
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,138
Believe it or not, I haven't even
set foot yet in the Prado in Madrid!

25
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,364
I can tell you now...

26
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:07,071
last night when you said
we had to rush back, I was furious.

27
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,479
That wasn't hard to see.

28
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,780
We usually spend the night talking, but
last night you acted like I didn't exist.

29
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,513
I'd arranged to be away three days.

30
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,420
My wife was going
to run the bookshop alone.

31
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,992
Today the Prado.
Tomorrow Toledo and Aranjuez.

32
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,062
A three-day vacation,
in other words.

33
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,426
So last night when you read
the letter I brought you...

34
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,500
and then said we had to set out
immediately, I was fuming!

35
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,934
So I ruined your trip, eh?

36
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,134
Take it up
with the Spanish police.

37
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,615
- There's a crowd already.
- Easter. They spend the day in Spain.

38
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,324
Easier for you.
They have less time to check passports.

39
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,398
- How did you manage it before?
- Before?

40
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,969
When the border was closed.
When there were no tourists.

41
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,231
We crossed over
through the mountains.

42
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,330
Sometimes we ran into
the Guardia Civil.

43
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,774
- And then?
- Then we'd shoot our way through.

44
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,682
- You're no problem at all.
- Why?

45
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,480
No one hearing you talk
would take you for a Spaniard.

46
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,247
Even I forget sometimes.

47
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
The last buddy I drove over
didn't speak a word of French.

48
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,454
He pretended to be asleep.

49
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,996
If they had asked him a single question,
our goose would have been cooked.

50
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,292
With you it's a cinch.

51
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,833
Please park your car
and step inside the station.

52
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,871
- Why? Listen, I'm in a hurry.
- Police check. Pull the car up there.

53
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,769
Come on, let's go.

54
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,977
- What's all this about?
- I've no idea either.

55
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,238
You think it's a random check?
You sure your papers are okay, Carlos?

56
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,818
Remember what we said.
It'll be all right.

57
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,189
Leave the key in the car.
Follow me.

58
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,557
- What about our bags?
- Never mind. Leave them.

59
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,204
Have you got something
against Citroens today?

60
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,345
Thank you.

61
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,948
So that's it.
I bought some books in his shop.

62
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,045
We struck up an acquaintance.

63
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,492
And so, Mr. Rene Sallanches,
you were there on vacation?

64
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,154
Yes.

65
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,859
- Alone?
- Yes, alone.

66
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,534
And you live in Paris
at Rue de l'Estrapade, number 4?

67
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,938
No, number 7.

68
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,645
And you met Mr.Jude
in his bookshop in Hendaye?

69
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,376
That's right.

70
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,714
And Mrs.Jude--
What's her first name again?

71
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,084
Marie. She's charming.

72
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,627
Do you have
a telephone in Paris?

73
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,356
Of course.

74
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,433
Medicis 33-74.

75
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,005
Call this number right away.

76
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,749
It's Sunday morning.
You'll wake up Nadine.

77
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,920
I told her nothing's wrong, but
she's worried and wants to speak to you.

78
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,134
What's wrong?
Did you run over another old lady?

79
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:54,002
- Everything's fine.
- Why did he call?

80
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,098
- A simple formality.
- Busybody.

81
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,701
These things happen, you know.

82
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,747
Are you staying in tonight?

83
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,409
Yes, I'll wait for you.

84
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,411
Then I'll see you tonight
at the house. Good-bye.

85
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,691
Good-bye, darling.

86
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,300
- They searched the car.
- Of course.

87
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,634
So what did you tell them?

88
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,365
I said you were in the area
on vacation.

89
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,239
You bought books in my shop
and we struck up an acquaintance.

90
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,279
I agreed to take a little trip
down to Spain to pick you up.

91
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,405
He asked, "From Madrid?"

92
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,507
"Yes," I said. "What of it?"

93
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,213
"Three hundred miles each way?
That's a long trip to make in 24 hours.

94
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,687
That doesn't leave you much time
for sightseeing."

95
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,521
That got my goat.
I said, "Driving relaxes me."

96
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,939
- Is the next train an express?
- Yes. The 9:55. First-class only.

97
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,815
9:55. I have time to see Antoine.

98
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,080
- Shouldn't I give him our message?
- I have time to do it myself.

99
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,086
I'd prefer we not be seen
at Antoine's together.

100
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,455
Let's do this: I'll drop you at my house,
and let Antoine know you're here.

101
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,493
I'll tell him to meet you at the station
15 minutes before your train leaves.

102
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,565
It's safer that way.

103
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,032
All of a sudden,
my memory failed me completely.

104
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:42,706
A total blank.
I forgot Sallanches' phone number.

105
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,612
"This is it."

106
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,481
I thought to myself,
"This is it.

107
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,579
We'll get caught
over this tiny detail."

108
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,625
Besides, I had no way of knowing
who would answer on the other end.

109
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,388
It the inspector had reached
Sallanches himself...

110
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,520
it would have blown my cover.

111
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,459
So the passport is false
but the phone number is real?

112
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,834
No, it's all real:

113
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,373
Rene Sallanches, his passport,
his daughter, his phone number.

114
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,273
The only fake element
in this story is me.

115
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,839
So all you do is switch photos?

116
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,044
You could put it like that.

117
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,285
See, Marie? It's nothing
more complicated than that.

118
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,922
All right.

119
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,657
You know everything
about the Sallanches family.

120
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,528
Your answers are correct.

121
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,898
But they know nothing about you.

122
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,563
That is, the person
using the passport.

123
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,469
But on the phone
they don't give you away?

124
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,836
No, they didn't give me away.

125
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,572
It's my lucky star.

126
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,680
Without my own little star,
I'd long since be dead or in jail.

127
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,884
Anyway, Nadine will explain.

128
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,419
Sallanches' daughter.
She's the one who answered the phone.

129
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,792
- Do you know her?
- No, I don't know any of them.

130
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,024
I know all about them,
but I don't know any of them.

131
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,728
It's odd you should speak
of a lucky star.

132
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,704
I've always thought
some people have lucky stars.

133
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,174
- You've never gone to their house?
- No, never.

134
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,341
So you really think
they stopped us by chance?

135
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,680
- Of course.
- Why?

136
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,278
Didn't you see? They stopped
another black Citroen behind us.

137
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,620
- Are you sure? I didn't notice.
- A suspect car is reported...

138
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,991
so they search all cars
of the same make and color.

139
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,998
- Suspect? How?
- There's still smuggling going on.

140
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,399
I've seen them search our cars
for gold, for example.

141
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,499
They found propaganda
hidden in the frame.

142
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,405
What happens then?

143
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,606
That depends. If it's in France,
jail, a fine, house arrest.

144
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,774
Nothing too terrible.

145
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,150
But if it's in Spain--

146
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,187
It's time to open up shop.

147
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,451
I'm going to get some sleep.
Antoine must be at the station.

148
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,796
- What if your guy's already crossed?
- Impossible.

149
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,737
- Do I know him?
- I'm sure you do. He goes so often.

150
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,741
But under many different names.

151
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,710
Something about this whole affair
still worries me.

152
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,247
What?

153
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,478
- How did they know I was in Madrid?
- They couldn't know.

154
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,456
The inspector took a stab in the dark
and just happened to get it right.

155
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,430
With all the arrests in Madrid,
aren't you on the spot too?

156
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,400
If I were, do you think the Spanish
police would have let me get away?

157
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,804
- Good luck, Carlos.
- Thanks.

158
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,598
Good-bye.

159
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,541
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

160
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,100
Greetings, friend.

161
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,601
- Greetings, Rafael.
- Has Juan arrived?

162
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,968
- Juan? No news of Juan.
- You weren't expecting him?

163
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,406
Sometimes I don't know who's coming.
They just ask me to get a car ready.

164
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,150
One way to Paris
and a visitor's pass.

165
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,015
Have many been crossing lately?

166
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,488
Yesterday, two cars to Andalusia,
using their vacation to work for us.

167
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,017
Today, the same car that goes
to Bilbao every two weeks.

168
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,098
I've got a car ready, ordered by Paris.
No idea who it's for.

169
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,168
- For how long?
- The week.

170
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,567
- Maybe that one's for Juan.
- I think he'd go through Perpignan.

171
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,005
- Why?
- He's been using this side too much.

172
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:08,171
Perpignan. You don't know
who handles the crossings there?

173
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,807
It's not my district. Anyway, what
can you accomplish by going there?

174
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,785
Can you tell me
what's going on with Juan?

175
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,947
The bookseller brought a letter
saying Juan would arrive in Madrid.

176
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,725
He must be stopped from going.

177
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,294
Have there been arrests?
There's been no word in the press.

178
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,260
It's too early. It just started.

179
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,629
Anyway, if Juan shows up,
have him wait here for new orders.

180
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,762
Okay, but I bet he's going to cross
at Perpignan.

181
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,503
Perpignan. Here we are.

182
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,507
At 3:34 p.m., you leave Bayonne
for Toulouse.

183
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,772
You arrive in Toulouse at 8:34 p.m.

184
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,781
You catch the train for Narbonne
at 9:13 p.m.

185
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:23,185
At 11:01 p.m., in Narbonne,
you catch the train to Perpignan.

186
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,554
You arrive in Perpignan
at 11:55 p.m.

187
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,559
Not exactly an express.

188
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,195
No, not exactly.

189
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,791
Juan hasn't crossed over yet,
unless he went through Perpignan.

190
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,926
You don't know.
You can do nothing alone.

191
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,974
Antoine's right. You don't even know
who's in charge in Perpignan.

192
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,237
You should go to Paris.
Juan is probably still there.

193
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,041
You'll find him home.

194
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,616
You need to see your people--
today.

195
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,209
Explain the Madrid situation to them,
that nobody should go there.

196
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,449
Eepecially not Juan.
He would be walking into a trap.

197
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,458
-If she hasn't told Lucienne, we're sunk.
-We are?

198
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,399
- How can she do it without Lucienne?
- She's used to it.

199
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:48,132
- Was she used to it at Royan last year?
- That's different. She wasn't at home.

200
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,870
Lucienne didn't leave just to be
with her nephews. Something happened.

201
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,468
You always dramatize.

202
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,346
I know what I'm saying.
She is lost without Lucienne!

203
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,543
Didn't she ask Lucienne to come?

204
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:04,110
The Marcels make two.
Unless Pierre comes. Two or three.

205
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,681
Then there's us, Raoul,
her two daughters, their husbands.

206
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,695
- And no Lucienne!
- Lucienne may be the first one there.

207
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,288
Without Lucienne, we're sunk!

208
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,267
Don't fret. Remember,
it's a holiday reunion.

209
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,304
Holiday?
With everyone in a foul mood?

210
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,897
Lucienne's not even family.
Don't exaggerate.

211
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,602
So what if she's not family?

212
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,407
Without her, we're a pretty family!

213
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,443
- I was sent by Antonio.
- What?

214
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,644
- Madame Lopez?
- No, I'm Madame Pluvier.

215
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,686
Sorry, I'm looking for
Madame Lopez.

216
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,585
There's no Madame Lopez here.

217
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,788
Building G, 10th floor,
number 107.

218
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,226
That's right,
but there's no Madame Lopez here.

219
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,389
Then I've made a mistake.

220
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,661
I beg your pardon.

221
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,130
Is she a refugee from Algeria?

222
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,231
A refugee?
No, I don't think so.

223
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,573
I mean, on account of the name.
There's lots of them around here.

224
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,475
Thank you. Good-bye.

225
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,613
You came to see Juan a year ago.

226
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,086
Building G, 10th floor,
number 107.

227
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,056
Care of Madame Lopez, you thought.

228
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,026
But there's no Juan now,
no Madame Lopez.

229
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:27,087
Maybe it was some other Building G,
some other 10th floor.

230
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,532
Perhaps Juan did go,
and he'll walk right into the trap.

231
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,531
Roberto.
You must find Roberto now.

232
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,369
She'll wonder what's wrong.

233
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,537
She'll realize something's happened
to her husband.

234
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,547
You'd rather not see her today.

235
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,517
And yet you need her. She's the one
who can take you to Roberto.

236
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,484
Last Thursday at 6:00 p.m...

237
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,182
Andres failed to show up
at the Botanical Gardens.

238
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,317
You had a beer
at the Cafe Nacional.

239
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,224
You thought nothing of it.

240
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,923
You assumed you'd see Andres
at the next meeting place.

241
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,025
But toward nightfall
came signs of approaching danger.

242
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,037
The comrade who operates
the print shop failed to come home.

243
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,039
His brother notified the others.

244
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,769
The closed little world we live in...

245
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,811
became unsettled
and full of snares.

246
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,009
Carmen?

247
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,889
You here?

248
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,529
What is it?
Is something wrong?

249
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,136
Andres?
What's happened to Andres?

250
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,875
By Friday it was clear
that Andres had disappeared...

251
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,387
and Luis and Jueto and Ricardo.

252
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,957
In the shadows we began to fight...

253
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,322
the unpredictable progress
of the police roundups...

254
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,090
severing the links
that bound one group to another...

255
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:11,135
suspending all meetings, all contacts,
setting new liaison networks.

256
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,205
But Andres had disappeared--
he has disappeared.

257
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,104
He could have disappeared
any day now for 15 years.

258
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,236
Carmen had expected, already accepted,
in anguish and rage...

259
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,906
this disappearance
that bursts upon her today.

260
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,416
Thursday evening at 6:00 p.m...

261
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,282
Andres did not show up
at the Botanical Gardens.

262
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,230
But you must wrest her
from her grief, her solitude.

263
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,166
She knows
where to find Roberto today...

264
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,000
among all these houses which empty
as the weekend draws to a close...

265
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,903
among all these lights
on a Sunday night.

266
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,067
Roberto organizes the crossings.

267
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,509
Only he will know
where to find Juan today.

268
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,605
He alone can catch up with Juan
before he too vanishes.

269
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,480
Roberto hates bad news.

270
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,486
An arrest gets on his nerves...

271
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,920
not just because it means
losing a comrade...

272
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,016
not just because of the months
and years of work...

273
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,754
to be done over from scratch...

274
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,592
but becauee the reality
of the world resists us...

275
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,462
because our actions seem
like a dream of indefinite progress.

276
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,094
He hates when reality
clashes with his dream.

277
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,934
It's as if he blames you...

278
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,873
for being the malicioue messenger
of the opaque reality...

279
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,739
that we cannot predict.

280
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,155
Ramon!

281
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,031
You have visitors.

282
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,096
I'll be damned! Carlos!

283
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,598
Why are you shouting?

284
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,906
What are you doing here?

285
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,248
You've put on some weight.

286
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,817
Getting old.
The easy life, you know.

287
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,696
Did Juan get away
all right this morning?

288
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,824
At noon. I finished his car last night
and he left today at noon.

289
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,667
- Which way did he go?
- Perpignan.

290
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,710
- And then to Barcelona?
- Yes, to Barcelona.

291
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,040
At noon?

292
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,012
Just at noon?

293
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,408
Where is he going to cross?
Where will he be tonight?

294
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,884
Perpignan.

295
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,150
Tomorrow he meets the contact who will
pick him up in Madrid in two weeks.

296
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,191
Then he crosses over.

297
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,660
- We can warn him, bring him back.
- It's of no use.

298
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,856
Anyway, it's too late.

299
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,990
Why not phone him in Perpignan?

300
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,931
The phone is too risky.

301
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,266
Oh, come on!
Then send him a wire.

302
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,230
Or one of us can catch the night train
and reach Perpignan in time.

303
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,810
Look, don't get so nervous.

304
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,436
In the morning
we meet with our comrades.

305
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,311
Right. We'll see tomorrow.

306
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,178
BORDER - TWO MILES

307
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,355
What's going on?
Why does Juan have to come back?

308
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,292
He mustn't go to Madrid.
They're making arrests.

309
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,124
Who have they arrested?

310
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,722
Andres and three more
from the Madrid committee.

311
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,395
The printer as well.
And it was still going on when I left.

312
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,267
Have you told Carmen?

313
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,500
We'll need to know more details
to tell if it's really serious.

314
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,539
You know as well as I
that they tend to exaggerate there.

315
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:19,344
It's natural. At the first sign of trouble,
they think everything's unraveling.

316
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:24,115
They're too close to things
to see the situation clearly.

317
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,452
And we see it better
from Paris?

318
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,152
Yes. We have
a broader perspective.

319
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,525
What about Juan?

320
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,828
He's in no danger. We have three days
before he leaves Barcelona.

321
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,697
In Perpignan he would be
even safer.

322
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,293
I'll take responsibility
for keeping him in Perpignan.

323
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,600
No, I'm in charge of the trips!

324
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,834
He has important work
to do in Barcelona.

325
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,275
Every minute counts now!

326
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,473
Are you all crazy here in Paris? Every
minute has counted for 25 years.

327
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,379
Why speak to me of 25 years...

328
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,418
with a general strike called
for 12 days from now?

329
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,579
And May 1st is no joke either,
so minutes do count!

330
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,682
May 1st comes around every year,
but Juan won't.

331
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,921
If he's caught, he'll get 20 years,
and you know it as well as I.

332
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,189
As far as the strike goes,
we'll discuss that tomorrow.

333
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,132
Listen, if you need someone
to go to Barcelona, I'd be happy to go.

334
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,703
- It'd get me out this rut.
- This rut?

335
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,399
Is your wife a rut now?
Are you having second thoughts?

336
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,839
These Breton women are amazing.

337
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,107
I talk about an undercover mission
to help a comrade in danger...

338
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,579
and you'd think
I was off on a vacation.

339
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,211
If anyone goes to Barcelona,
I should go.

340
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,516
We'll see.

341
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,615
Don't stand there all night.
Come in the house and have a drink

342
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,629
Good idea, but bring it out here.
I have to finish up this car.

343
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,152
- How did it start this time?
- Probably the same way it always does.

344
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:11,661
- Of course. It's always the same.
- No, it wasn't the same this time.

345
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,254
No, they struck several places
at the same moment.

346
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,767
The printing press and the men
working it-- all taken at once.

347
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,497
Andres and Luis were taken
in their hideouts.

348
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,368
It's the first time
that's happened.

349
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,567
So Juan could be in danger
in Madrid?

350
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,205
The raid took place
in his sector.

351
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,804
He's been going there for years.
He may have been spotted.

352
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,440
What about you?
You've been going there for years too.

353
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,746
Yet here you are,
drinking wine with us.

354
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,551
Luis' wife heard the police say
during the search...

355
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,786
they had pictures of a Paris leader
taken with a telephoto lens...

356
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,828
they were sure to arrest next.

357
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,660
- It has to be Juan.
- Films, photos-- it's all fabrication!

358
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,702
The police spread these rumors
to demoralize the opposition.

359
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,004
Thursday, the very day
the arrests were made...

360
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,075
didn't you have an appointment
with Andres?

361
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,768
Yet here you are.

362
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:03,075
Because there is no photo,
and Andres won't talk.

363
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,579
It's very simple.

364
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,883
They struck at us
because they're afraid!

365
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,785
They want to nip
our preparations in the bud.

366
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,723
They conducted a raid. So what?
They've been doing that for 25 years!

367
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,817
That's how war is:
They strike, and we strike back!

368
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,557
- Don't get excited.
- I'm not excited.

369
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,259
I may raise my voice, but it means
nothing. It's this crazy life we lead.

370
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,427
What's crazy is
that it's gone on this long.

371
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,037
All right.

372
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,104
Tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.
at the Pierre Curie station.

373
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,984
Marianne must be waiting for you.

374
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,460
You didn't let her know
you were coming?

375
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,053
She's probably left Paris.

376
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,656
Besides, I didn't come for her.
I came for Juan.

377
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,708
- Yes, she must be out of town.
- Why?

378
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:13,445
- Because it's Easter.
- So it is. You see? One forgets!

379
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,315
if you find the house empty,
come sleep here.

380
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,756
Maybe. Thanks.

381
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,228
- Is it you?
- That depends.

382
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,305
Was it you on the phone
this morning?

383
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,237
Yes. I recognize your voice.

384
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:13,174
I waited for you until now.

385
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,781
Come on!

386
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,520
Your father isn't home?

387
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,583
If he were, God knows
where you would be now!

388
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,289
You don't know how true that is.

389
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,195
But I do know.

390
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,928
They ask to speak to my father.

391
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,231
I say he's on a trip,
which is the truth.

392
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,034
For once, the truth
served a useful purpose.

393
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,138
What happened at the border?

394
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:51,011
A spot check. Mere routine.

395
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,777
But they picked us this time.
The phone call could have ruined it.

396
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,921
They mentioned Spain
and I knew right away.

397
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,513
My father told me
about the passport.

398
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,826
We have a weakness for Spain
in our family.

399
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:11,329
So I pretended to be alarmed.
I asked lots of questions.

400
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,631
I even demanded
to talk to my father.

401
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,366
I was admirable,
full of daughterly anxiety.

402
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,908
In any case, you kept your cool.
You got me out of a fix.

403
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,841
It's not the first time.

404
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,994
So tell me, how was I in the role
of the affectionate father?

405
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:51,135
When my father feels affectionate,
he doesn't call me "darling."

406
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,445
He calls me "Nana."

407
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,358
I'm sure the border incident
was nothing at all.

408
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:15,057
But suppose they were
to make inquiries in Paris.

409
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,464
- When does your father return?
- Tomorrow night.

410
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:23,299
Then he must have his passport
to show just in case.

411
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:27,939
- I'll bring it by tomorrow afternoon.
- You're leaving?

412
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,140
If I hurry,
I can just make the 10:00 show.

413
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,580
What do you do?

414
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,384
Besides this, I mean.

415
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,050
- Nothing else.
- Nothing else ever?

416
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,027
- Not for ages.
- And before that?

417
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,633
Long ago, I think I wanted to write.
Same as everyone.

418
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,697
What you do
is far more interesting!

419
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,974
-So you're a professional revolutionary?
-That's it precisely.

420
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,411
A real professional.

421
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,413
What a terrific profession!

422
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:14,524
How is a passport falsified?
Can't they tell the photo was replaced?

423
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,652
No, they'd have to check police files
to see whether the photo is fake.

424
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,697
But they don't keep those files
at the border.

425
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,459
Show me.

426
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,879
So you could be my father.

427
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,182
That's right, Nana.

428
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,960
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

429
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,266
Is someone expecting you?

430
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,728
Yes.

431
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,716
What's your real name?

432
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,820
Sometimes it startles me
to hear my real name.

433
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,827
What is it?

434
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,563
Domingo.

435
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,142
That means "Sunday."

436
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,211
Hello, Sunday.

437
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,247
Hello, Nana.

438
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,485
What time shall I bring
the passport by tomorrow?

439
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,886
After lunch, but no later than 3:30.
I have to meet somebody.

440
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,487
Nadine Sallanches.

441
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,089
Rue de l'Estrapade,
number 7, third floor.

442
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,635
Born October 26, 1944.

443
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,894
Completed her secondary studies
at the Lycee Fenelon.

444
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,440
Begins her university studies this year.

445
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,306
Speaks English fluently,
Spanish as well.

446
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,879
Lives with her father, civil service
engineer for the government...

447
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,881
who is often away
because of his work.

448
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,077
Five feet five...

449
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:38,087
brunette, brown eyes,
appendicitis three years ago.

450
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,319
- Is that me?
- This data came with the passport.

451
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,189
You don't miss a detail!

452
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,894
No, not a detail.

453
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,257
It's the big picture
we sometimes lose sight of.

454
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,227
See you tomorrow.

455
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,235
Good night, Sunday.

456
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:08,102
I'm not alone.
We're working.

457
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,469
And to think I took my time
coming home.

458
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,906
I was sure
you wouldn't be in Paris.

459
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,478
No one told me.

460
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,343
No one knew.
It was unexpected.

461
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,746
- Diego.
- Yes?

462
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,716
Nothing.Just saying your name.

463
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,522
You're here. I am happy.

464
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,791
I'm leaving again.

465
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,600
- You are?
- Tomorrow.

466
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,176
You know Agnes?

467
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,088
I thought you had already met.

468
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,056
- I don't think so.
- I'm sure we haven't.

469
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,826
You never saw Agnes
at the office?

470
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:07,091
No, never. Impossible!

471
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,325
Diego is always traveling.

472
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,832
Always?

473
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:15,269
Every time I asked Marianne to
introduce us, you were away on a trip.

474
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,773
I even began to wonder
whether you really existed!

475
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,109
Now you see I really do exist.

476
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,315
Stay with us for a while.
We've finished.

477
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,151
Jeanine and Bill will be so glad
to see you again.

478
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,556
We're doing a book
on all the cities of the world.

479
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,857
That is, on the way a city speaks
to its inhabitants...

480
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,695
and how people answer back,
and how this becomes a language.

481
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,770
It's complicated to explain,
but in pictures it's simple.

482
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,774
We'll mix Bill's photographs
with drawings by Folon and Topor.

483
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:53,776
Agnes and I are doing the layout.

484
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,573
Bill's off to Brazil...

485
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,512
so we're choosing some
of the first pictures before he goes.

486
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,709
We're taking advantage
of the Easter holiday.

487
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,343
We've set up shop here,
where it's so peaceful.

488
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,855
They'll wonder
if you don't come and say hello.

489
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,225
Want something to eat, Diego?

490
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,888
No, I ate on the plane.

491
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,029
The weather was beautiful.

492
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,936
The fountains are still there.

493
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,376
Fountains?

494
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,306
What fountains?

495
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,546
On Piazza Navona.

496
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:39,453
The Pincio fountains.
All the fountains.

497
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,954
- Haven't you ever been in Rome?
- Rome? Yes, of course.

498
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,261
- What took you to Rome?
- Work.

499
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,267
Didn't you know
that I work occasionally?

500
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,872
A conference sponsored by UNESCO.
Teaching in underdeveloped countries.

501
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,607
You haven't grown tired
of working as an interpreter?

502
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,310
It pays well. No taxes.

503
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,852
You work six months a year.
You travel.

504
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,448
I'm not ambitious.

505
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,824
It's late.

506
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,521
It's time we left you two alone.

507
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,997
Yes, it is late.

508
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,755
It seems things in Spain
are stirring.

509
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:49,587
Yes. As Marianne says, "It's forever
stirring but it never changes."

510
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,696
And what do you say?

511
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,059
Nothing.

512
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,932
I'm your friend, Diego.

513
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,605
Nobody would like
what I have to say about Spain.

514
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,642
I'm not even sure
I like it myself.

515
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:17,647
Poor, unhappy Spain.
Heroic, gallant Spain. I'm sick of it!

516
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,053
Spain's become the lyrical
rallying point of the left.

517
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,820
A myth for veterans of past wars.

518
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,192
Meanwhile, 14 million tourists
vacation in Spain every year.

519
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,559
Spain is nothing but a tourist's dream
or a civil-war myth...

520
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,366
all bundled up with Lorca's plays--
and I'm fed up with Lorca's plays.

521
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,702
Sterile women and peasant dramas!

522
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,901
And you can have the legend too!

523
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,468
I was not at Verdun, or Teruel,
or at the front at Ebro.

524
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,981
And the people now doing what counts
in Spain weren't either.

525
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,485
Twenty-year-olds, inspired
not by our past, but by their future.

526
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,920
Spain is no longer the dream of 1936
but the truth of 1965...

527
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,458
however disconcerting.

528
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,891
Thirty years have gone by,
and veterans give me a pain in the ass!

529
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,270
I'm sorry.

530
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,338
It's all sort of muddled.

531
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,942
Working tomorrow?

532
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,182
I'll see you then.

533
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,514
Right. See you tomorrow.

534
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,778
- Good night.
- I'm staying.

535
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,990
- You are?
- Yes.

536
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,357
I should help Marianne
put away the photos.

537
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,158
Then I'll drive you home.

538
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,529
Agnes lives in St. Cloud, and there are
no more trains at this hour.

539
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,137
Good night all the same.

540
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,185
Why was that little bitch
asking all those questions?

541
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:41,026
You talked about Rome
and UNESCO.

542
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,828
Just ten minutes earlier, I said you were
in Brussels with the United Nations.

543
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,165
If they think I'm a liar,
too bad!

544
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:51,002
You? Why just you?
if you lied, so did I!

545
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,406
It's our life that seems like a lie.

546
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,310
Didn't you hear Agnes?
A fake couple living a fake life!

547
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:58,972
Maybe that's what it seems like.

548
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,346
But it's not true.

549
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,580
For me it wasn't a lie.

550
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:11,024
You spoke of the fountains.
I was happy.

551
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,895
The Piazza Navona
must be deserted now.

552
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,797
You can hear
the water splashing.

553
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,172
- Where are you going?
- To take Agnes home.

554
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,004
Can't the little bitch take a cab?

555
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,839
She's broke. I promised.

556
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,540
St. Cloud is a long way away.

557
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,977
I wonder if it might not be better
to tell the truth.

558
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,056
Sure. Let's put an ad in the paper!

559
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,217
But we can tell
Jeanine and Bill anything.

560
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:46,125
And your Agnes too?

561
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,189
You think they don't suspect
when you go on like you did earlier?

562
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,860
No, Bill doesn't.

563
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,438
He's a photographer.
He does his work.

564
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,302
Anyway, we can't tell
anybody anything.

565
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,205
- It's a question of principle.
- Your principles scare me.

566
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,768
There have been arrests in Madrid.
Many of my colleagues have fallen.

567
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,641
I want a child by you.
This is no life!

568
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,448
What is a life?

569
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,925
A child by you.
Can you imagine?

570
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,120
We'll discuss it calmly.

571
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,062
My child. It's not something
to discuss calmly.

572
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:26,226
Afterwards you can go away, leave me,
even forget me if you like.

573
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,233
This isn't the time.

574
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,797
Yes, it is the time.

575
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,846
Those arrests.

576
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,854
When did they start?

577
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,424
Thursday, three days ago.

578
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,762
What does it make you want
when things like that happen?

579
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,925
Want? What do you mean?

580
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,831
Does it make you want to go on
doing what you're doing...

581
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,567
even if you're left all alone?

582
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,007
One is never left all alone.

583
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,671
We must let them know that we exist.
That the work still goes on.

584
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,244
That's right.

585
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,720
I'll be back.

586
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,390
Agnes? Are you ready?

587
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:00,786
"Hello, Patrick!"

588
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,367
Now, to remove the photo.

589
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,389
A lucky star, madame.

590
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:19,230
A tiny little star
for personal use.

591
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,827
A starfish for every purpose.

592
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,071
All right. This goes here...

593
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,316
and this goes over there.

594
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,904
My expenses.

595
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:34,268
Dinner in Madrid, 230.

596
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:40,616
Gasoline, 635.

597
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,885
Breakfast, 42.

598
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,935
For patience and irony...

599
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,063
are the chief virtues
of a Bolshevik.

600
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,024
"My name is Nana."

601
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,922
And mine is Sunday.

602
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,823
Six months
without seeing you, Diego.

603
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,193
It's not possible.

604
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,966
If you had to stay here--
I don't know--

605
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:23,845
If things became too dangerous for you
to go to Madrid, would you miss it?

606
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,282
I would miss Spain.

607
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,676
I really would.

608
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,289
Like something
you would miss terribly...

609
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:37,382
whose absence
would be unbearable.

610
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,421
The people.

611
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:47,495
Strangers who open a door who
recognize you and whom you recognize.

612
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,371
Being part of something together.

613
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,940
Spain. Your people.

614
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,881
That's your life.

615
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:09,757
The other day
I almost slept with a man.

616
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,522
Why?

617
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,856
I thought I wanted to.

618
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:19,162
No. I mean why tell me?

619
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,235
Would you tell, Diego?

620
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,339
I don't know.

621
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,340
Why didn't you?

622
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,014
Because...

623
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,420
the moment always comes when
you're through sleeping with a man.

624
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,484
When you're through making love.

625
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,496
At that point...

626
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:53,628
he should be gone.
He should have disappeared.

627
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,465
To wake up
beside anyone but you...

628
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,775
is unimaginable.

629
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,018
It's only later
that things get complicated.

630
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,953
Don't you agree?

631
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,621
I'm hungry.

632
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:24,529
I thought you ate on the plane
from Rome.

633
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,972
Nine years ago,
I was the one you told your lies to.

634
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:39,480
A torrent of lies to hide who you were
and what you were doing in Rome.

635
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,379
Of course.

636
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,543
You told me
your name was Francisco...

637
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,245
and then Rafael...

638
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,288
and then Carlos.

639
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,256
I spent months,
both in Rome and in Paris...

640
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,796
sorting out your truth
from your lies.

641
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,457
They weren't lies.

642
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,558
They were barriers.

643
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:02,567
Against what?

644
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:06,938
Falling in love isn't on the agenda
for a professional revolutionary.

645
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:09,770
What is?

646
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,181
Patience.

647
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,181
Above all, patience.

648
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,415
I'm starved.
Don't you have anything to eat?

649
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:26,654
Next year, if you're still spending
half your time in Madrid...

650
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,855
I'm going to move there.

651
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,598
Move there?
What do you mean?

652
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,229
Live there. Find some work that
lets me follow you around.

653
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,807
I like having houses
in different places.

654
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,970
In Madrid? You barely speak
ten words of Spanish.

655
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,343
I learned French well enough.

656
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,384
Anyway, what kind of work?

657
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,086
Same as here.
They publish books in Spain too.

658
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:56,189
Well, we wouldn't get far
on my 800 francs a month.

659
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,852
I thought you got a raise.

660
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:02,863
You're right. 875 francs.

661
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,830
And what do you make here?

662
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,663
Three thousand a month?

663
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:10,637
- You'd never make that much there.
- I don't need to make that much.

664
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,770
I need you.

665
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:16,174
Anyway, it's out of the question.

666
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,840
A girlfriend in the same city where I'm
working in the underground? Too risky.

667
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,181
Was it serious this time?

668
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,978
Did they arrest people from Paris?
People I know?

669
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,887
- You know Juan--
- Juan was arrested?

670
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:33,450
No, not yet.
That's why I came back.

671
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,658
I'm sure they have his picture.

672
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,875
Ivry, Porte des Lilas, Six-Routes...

673
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,178
Quatre-Chemine, Aubervilliers...

674
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,617
la Poterne des Peupliers,
Victor-Hugo...

675
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:08,053
Jaures, Paul Vaillant-Couturier.

676
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,322
You know these suburbs
like the back of your hand.

677
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,019
You arrive from your own country...

678
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:16,758
and at your every return
you find this landscape of exile.

679
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,115
You see once more those desiccated,
tireless, worn-out men...

680
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,208
fastidious about detail but less clear
about the larger picture...

681
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,219
ready to die: your comrades.

682
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,380
You'll again find this comradeship...

683
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,924
irreplaceable and yet eaten away
by a lack of reality.

684
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,221
You'll spend whole days
in Ivry or Aubervilliers...

685
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,024
trying to rebuild your country...

686
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,894
in the likeness of your memory.

687
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,302
Toiling stubbornly to force your dreams
into the far-off reality of Spain.

688
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,271
Good morning!

689
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,346
How goes it?

690
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,318
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

691
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,055
Fine.

692
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,565
- You had a good trip?
- Yes.

693
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,710
It's in the paper.

694
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,317
"According to official sources...

695
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,651
the Spanish police has been
carrying out...

696
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:50,224
a vast preventive operation...

697
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:54,160
against various extreme-left
working-class groups in Madrid.

698
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:59,193
A printing press was seized
and several dozen arrests were made...

699
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,838
including ringleaders who entered
the country illegally from France.

700
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:07,898
These measures appear to be
directly linked to the unrest...

701
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:11,241
during recent months
among the working classes in Madrid."

702
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:29,227
- Here. I know you all like coffee.
- Good idea.

703
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,896
I'm going to run some errands.

704
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,269
If the doorbell rings, don't answer.

705
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:58,050
All right. We can begin.

706
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,424
I'll try to sum up the situation,
comrades...

707
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,829
based on the information
we had received by Saturday.

708
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,232
You again have the feeling
you've lived this before...

709
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:10,237
that you've said all this before
over the years.

710
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:15,066
How often have you come here
after a wave of arrests, after a "fall"?

711
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:17,407
They call it a "fall" in Spanish.

712
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,344
They say a colleague has "fallen"...

713
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:22,542
that a printing press
or an organization has "fallen."

714
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:26,815
Sooner or later, say the old-timers,
everybody falls.

715
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:29,482
The road is long
and marked by falls.

716
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:34,317
How often have you come here
to examine why these falls occurred...

717
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,058
or to decide
what measures to take next?

718
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:40,727
Andres did not show up for the meeting
at the Botanical Gardens.

719
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:44,237
That's when it all started:
Thursday, three days ago.

720
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,401
We must therefore withdraw
the call to strike in Madrid.

721
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:53,345
I must say, in general, I disagree
with the directive in this case.

722
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:10,022
Carlos has given us a completely
subjective view of the situation.

723
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:17,069
Carlos has given us a completely
subjective view of the situation.

724
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,707
He exaggerates the consequences
of the arrests currently being made.

725
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:24,438
Indeed, he seems to have lost
all political perspective.

726
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,484
What is the situation
that has led to these arrests?

727
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,490
A political offensive
by the working class...

728
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,560
by students and peasants.

729
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:43,155
A situation where the dictatorship
is desperate and on its last legs.

730
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,098
Even the current arrests reflect...

731
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,965
the regime's fear in the face
of resistance by the masses.

732
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,335
Under these conditions,
they cannot halt...

733
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,103
the movement's advance,
its spread, its progress.

734
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,345
We are on the eve
of a general strike.

735
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:05,009
That is why we decided
to send Juan to Madrid...

736
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,953
with precise orders
and instructions.

737
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:13,120
The mass movement must be organized
and given a single goal.

738
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:15,628
That goal is the general strike.

739
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:19,724
The requisite conditions exist
and we must act now.

740
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:23,134
A date had to be set
and we have set it.

741
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,900
The strike is called for April 30th...

742
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,876
with nationwide demonstrations
on May 1st.

743
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,907
Carlos disagrees with the decision
to call a general strike.

744
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,076
He says we must bear in mind
the realities of the situation.

745
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:41,247
But what does "realities
of the situation" really mean?

746
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,588
That we should allow the political
situation to come to a head on its own?

747
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,991
That's mere opportunism,
pure and simple!

748
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,691
I never said we should just let things
develop spontaneously.

749
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:54,235
You never said we should just let things
develop spontaneously.

750
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:58,739
You merely question certain forms
of action under certain conditions.

751
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,071
A general strike is not
the sole form of struggle...

752
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:04,009
an inevitable finale.

753
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,377
Lenin voiced criticisms
of a general strike...

754
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,507
insofar as it tends to preclude
other forms of struggle.

755
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,825
If you wish to discuss Lenin,
then we'll discuss Lenin.

756
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:21,692
You accuse us of voluntarism,
but Lenin proved precisely that...

757
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:26,359
a dose of voluntarism, of revolutionary
subjectivism, is indispensable.

758
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,629
Your criticism is purely negative.

759
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,205
What are you really proposing?

760
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:35,443
Criticism is always negative
at first.

761
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:37,239
You try to make yourself
understood...

762
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,474
to explain it's not the idea of
a general strike you're criticizing...

763
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,777
but merely the specific situation
to which it's being applied.

764
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,082
You oppose the call
for a general strike on April 30th...

765
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,588
because the required conditions
are absent.

766
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,148
Another failure may discourage
the masses from this form of action.

767
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,320
You oppose deciding
from a position of exile...

768
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,365
a plan of action
and its date of execution in Spain.

769
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,629
We cannot be proxies for workers
in Bilbao, Barcelona, Madrid...

770
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,398
or decide for them.

771
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,235
Our underground can only organize
and serve as an instrument...

772
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,138
to carry out
the will of the masses.

773
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,904
It cannot replace that will.

774
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,043
Why speak of exiles as if they were
in opposition to those in Spain...

775
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,116
the underground
in opposition to the masses?

776
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,651
No, I don't.

777
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:20,221
I only mean one cannot
replace the other.

778
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,365
It would be absurd to imply...

779
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,405
that Carlos has been intimidated
by the arrests.

780
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:41,374
Over the past ten years he has often
proven he's not easily intimidated.

781
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,741
But he has been lacking
in political insight.

782
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,780
Just what is the situation?

783
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,246
Juan is in Barcelona.

784
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,318
He is scheduled to meet Carlos
in Madrid on Thursday.

785
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:54,185
But Carlos is here and Juan
has been left to his own devices.

786
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,587
We must reach Juan
in Barcelona...

787
01:14:56,692 --> 01:15:00,685
and set up another contact for him
with the group in Madrid.

788
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,060
We're forced to increase
the number of trips...

789
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,360
and, as a result,
the risk automatically increases too.

790
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:08,402
This is what Carlos' undue haste
has led to.

791
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,200
But if Carlos had instead
remained in Madrid...

792
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,298
he could have followed the raid
hour by hour.

793
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,104
He could have taken
certain steps.

794
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,669
Juan would be protected
by Carlos' presence in Madrid.

795
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:23,217
These are the results of
an individual decision lightly taken...

796
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,445
without taking into account
the constraints of the act...

797
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:28,785
or respecting the decisions
made by the central committee.

798
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,295
You're not going to Barcelona.
You're staying here.

799
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:45,931
Ramon will go
and accompany Juan to Madrid.

800
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:50,774
You just spent six months in Spain,
in the hub of day-to-day action.

801
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:53,871
Perhaps the details of a partial reality
have blinded you.

802
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,611
The dozens of tiny, true little details
have clouded your vision.

803
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,483
You'll take a break.
You need to think things over.

804
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,649
Discuss matters calmly with others.
Let them set you straight.

805
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:06,284
You're staying here.

806
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,859
Let's go.

807
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,728
Let's go!

808
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,861
The passport.

809
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,736
Sal lanches.

810
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,582
Here it is.

811
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,226
Sallanches, Rene.

812
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:17,495
Born October 17, 1922.

813
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,071
It will just take a minute.

814
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,809
We need a passport for Ramon.

815
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,480
- When?
- Today.

816
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:44,650
- This afternoon.
- Always in a rush!

817
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:49,894
- Speak French, all right?
- Yes, of course.

818
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,337
The work going well?

819
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,908
Yes, let me talk to her.

820
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:05,079
I'm not leaving anymore.

821
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,147
Yes, I'm staying here with you.

822
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:13,148
Unhappy? No. Why?

823
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,554
A long time.

824
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,655
Maybe forever.

825
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,355
We'll take a vacation.

826
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,294
All right. See you tonight.

827
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:30,560
Good-bye.

828
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:37,020
ENJOY THE SUN AND SURF
VACATION AT LA PINEDA

829
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,103
Who is it?

830
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,173
- It's Sunday.
- No, it's Monday.

831
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,400
I know it's Monday.
I'm Sunday.

832
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,272
I expected you.
Aren't you coming?

833
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,743
I was busy.
I have that thing for you.

834
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:56,011
- I have to go out now.
- I know you have a date. Where?

835
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,880
What does that matter
if you're not coming?

836
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,886
No, I was just wondering.

837
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,956
At "La Chope. "Know it?

838
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,718
- Yes, I do.
- What's so funny?

839
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:08,057
Nothing. How about 6:00?

840
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,393
Fine. Where?

841
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,399
The lobby of Bullier Hall, 6:00.

842
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:18,734
- Why not my house?
- I'd prefer somewhere else, all right?

843
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,705
6:00 then. Bye.

844
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,380
- What would you like?
- Coffee.

845
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,210
You wouldn't have a cigarette,
would you?

846
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,110
Keep them.

847
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,583
This place is lousy with cops.

848
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,624
I wouldn't know.

849
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,455
I would.
I work for them.

850
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,818
- But nobody followed me!
- You're crazy!

851
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,326
- There were three of them in a car.
- Are you sure?

852
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,521
I should know-- it's my job!

853
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,428
A car? I can't believe it.
I even took one-way streets.

854
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,398
One got out and followed you.

855
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:31,028
I tailed him.
You saw nothing?

856
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:35,098
Some men did look at me, but not
like that. It does happen on occasion.

857
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,940
- Why are the cops on your tail?
- You think it's the police?

858
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,879
I ought to know. What do you do
that might interest the police?

859
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:43,075
- Nothing.
- That's not true.

860
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,618
- Why are you speaking to me like that?
- I have to know!

861
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,121
If they are cops, it's dangerous
for you to meet me. They'll spot you.

862
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,124
They're still tailing your boyfriend
at Edgar-Quinet.

863
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:53,786
- Miguel?
- Yes, the guy with you.

864
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,363
- At Edgar-Quinet?
- So you were hiding something.

865
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:58,022
Go on. Tell me what happened.

866
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,296
You split up at Maubert.
Your friend took the Metro.

867
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:04,861
The younger cop followed him.
We all got off at Raspail.

868
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:05,997
Raspail?

869
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:08,371
- Your friend went into a house.
- What about the cop?

870
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:12,276
The cop wrote down the number and left,
unless he's still hiding nearby.

871
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,541
I've got to go. They may be planning
to make a search.

872
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,345
You must help me. It's serious.

873
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,383
They're working for Spain too,
you know.

874
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:36,662
I'm taking Papa's car
to pick him up at the station.

875
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:58,148
- Would you care to explain?
- I can't, Domingo. Later.

876
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:01,251
Turn left, then continue
along the cemetery.

877
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,865
I don't see anyone.
Turn on your lights.

878
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,404
Go ahead now.

879
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:31,219
- How long?
- I don't know. Five minutes.

880
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:35,092
I'll pick you up in ten minutes
in front of the Delambre movie theater.

881
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:38,355
The registration's in the glove
compartment. You have a license?

882
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,127
- Several.
- I mean a real one.

883
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:42,635
Yes, even a real one!

884
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,276
Go on!

885
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,873
Good evening.

886
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:39,220
- What's that?
- A suitcase.

887
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,329
Of course it's a suitcase.

888
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,500
- It looks heavy.
- Papers and more papers.

889
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,670
- I'll let you work.
- We're just finishing up.

890
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,370
Who was the woman
I passed in the hall?

891
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:00,275
Lola.

892
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,724
I want to say,
about last night--

893
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:15,591
Well, If I can ever be of help--

894
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:18,257
A photographer gets around,
you know.

895
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:25,398
That's all. I'm sure Agnes must be
mad with curiosity.

896
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,782
All through?

897
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:19,255
Bill took Agnes home.
He said we've done enough today.

898
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,963
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Why?

899
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:30,265
You had a visitor. That dark, thin
fellow who seems to hate me.

900
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:32,038
What are you saying?

901
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,473
That's my impression.
Or he distrusts me.

902
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,737
- You're crazy.
- I can tell.

903
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:40,473
He's suspicious of my work,
the way I dress.

904
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,243
He must think I'm the wrong kind
of woman for an agent like you.

905
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,879
So what did he want?

906
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,716
He seemed very agitated.

907
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:52,350
He came by twice and made me repeat
the message. He must take me for a fool!

908
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,124
Anyway, plans have changed.

909
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,666
You're not staying.
You're going to Barcelona.

910
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:03,965
He expects you at 11:00 a.m.
at the same Metro exit as today.

911
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,963
You'll meet to discuss your trip.

912
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:10,442
You'll eat there
and leave directly from the meeting.

913
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:14,243
Take your things with you.
They'll bring a passport.

914
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:17,048
Barcelona?

915
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:22,320
He didn't say why I'm going?

916
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:25,824
It's not his style
to give explanations.

917
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:28,293
I'm fed up.
Completely fed up!

918
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:31,729
This morning I'd lost all political
perspective. I needed a break.

919
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,233
I needed to think, talk it over...

920
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:37,236
which means engage in self-criticism--
That's what they really meant.

921
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:40,601
Now I'm suddenly fit
to send to Barcelona, just like that.

922
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,176
Well, they can find
someone else!

923
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,778
No need to get up at the crack of dawn,
since you don't leave till noon.

924
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,223
Would you like to go out tonight?

925
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:08,625
I thought this was no life.

926
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:12,331
No, it's not a life.

927
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:18,238
What do you want to do?

928
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,807
I don't know.

929
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,411
A movie?

930
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,310
If you'd like.

931
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:34,921
- What do you want to see?
- Whatever you say. I don't care.

932
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:38,154
Would you mind driving me
to the station before the movie?

933
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,167
I'd like to check this suitcase there.

934
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,265
Why?

935
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:45,236
- Because.
- But why?

936
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:49,366
- I prefer not to keep it here.
- You've always kept your papers here.

937
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:51,741
All the same, I prefer not to.

938
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:57,874
- There's nothing else?
- What else?

939
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:01,081
Something you haven't told me?

940
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,681
Nothing of consequence.
Just incidental details.

941
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:07,859
I love you, Diego.

942
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:11,191
I know you do.

943
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:19,168
Is that for us?

944
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,799
Yes, it is.

945
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:33,043
Well, now...

946
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,349
what about your lights?

947
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,083
You're right. I forgot.

948
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:38,556
Your registration, please.

949
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:51,629
- Is the car yours?
- Yes, Officer.

950
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,865
- Are you the husband?
- No, I'm not the husband.

951
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:08,178
Your driver's license, please.

952
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:19,128
You're not French?

953
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:23,636
- What are you?
- Spanish. A Spanish refugee.

954
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:26,468
Your papers, please.

955
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:28,832
You have them.

956
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:36,442
do you realize what driving
without lights could cost you?

957
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,042
No, this is the first time
it's happened to me.

958
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:44,283
You shouldn't trust your car
to absent-minded people.

959
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,159
All right. Go ahead this time.

960
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:51,060
- But be more careful in the future.
- Thank you, Officer.

961
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:03,038
Don't you want me to go?
Didn't you hear him?

962
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:05,908
"Don't trust your suitcase
to absent-minded people."

963
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:09,281
Do you really know
how the lockers work?

964
01:34:04,872 --> 01:34:08,603
"Are you the husband?"
"No, I'm not the husband."

965
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:11,610
You should have seen your face!

966
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,942
Do I have the face of a husband?

967
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:17,279
No, but I am a wife to you anyway.

968
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:30,623
Stop at that cafe.

969
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:39,637
- I have to make a call.
- Now? Before the movie?

970
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,402
I'll just be a minute.

971
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:50,010
- Did Manolo say 11:00?
- Who?

972
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:53,052
- The little thin man? 11:00 sharp.
- I'll be right back.

973
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:05,356
I'm sorry to bother you this late, sir.
May I speak to Nadine?

974
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,158
Thank you.

975
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,933
It's me.

976
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,500
I must see you
and your friends tomorrow.

977
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:19,208
The afternoon is too late.

978
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,878
What's that?

979
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:24,075
Too late for everything!

980
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:27,548
9:00 sharp.
Same Metro stop as today.

981
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,147
On the platform, "Etoile" side.

982
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:33,692
Without fail, Nadine. Good-bye.

983
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:43,426
What's wrong?

984
01:35:43,537 --> 01:35:46,734
Nothing. I just had to arrange
for someone to pick up the suitcase.

985
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:49,537
It couldn't wait?

986
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:53,306
Manolo could have come
for it at the house.

987
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:56,614
Do you mind If I conduct
my work as I see fit?

988
01:35:57,785 --> 01:36:00,049
The truth is,
it's not just the suitcase.

989
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:04,854
You want me to tell you?

990
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:07,951
I don't want anything, but you're going
to tell me anyway, so go on.

991
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:20,639
Yesterday you wanted to go
to Barcelona to head off Juan...

992
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:22,709
but you were on edge.

993
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,677
You exploded
in front of Jeanine and Bill.

994
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:29,445
You, who are always so cautious.

995
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:32,849
You think you sounded
like a UNESCO interpreter?

996
01:36:34,088 --> 01:36:36,386
By noon today,
you weren't leaving.

997
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:40,017
You said,
"I'm staying here with you."

998
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,493
But you were unhappy.

999
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:45,858
What happened this morning?

1000
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:50,331
- This morning?
- At your meeting.

1001
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,649
You seem to be drifting, Diego.

1002
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:06,242
It's like you're in a fog,
no longer sure where you're going.

1003
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,756
I know where I'm going:
Barcelona.

1004
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:16,091
I suppose I'll accompany Juan
to Madrid and then return here.

1005
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:19,758
I must take a break,
talk things over with them.

1006
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:23,768
You see, in Spain I see things
from too close-up.

1007
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:26,101
Reality blinds me.

1008
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:29,233
I must regain a broader perspective,
even if it's unreal.

1009
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:33,406
- I don't understand you anymore.
- It's very simple.

1010
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:38,474
Our people live in the belief that
it will all blow sky-high any day now.

1011
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:42,781
And that's all right. No one
can stand the idea of dying in exile.

1012
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:46,819
But it's not true.
There's still a long road ahead of us.

1013
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:50,795
That can't be!
It's true that it has to explode!

1014
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:53,427
Listen.

1015
01:37:55,302 --> 01:37:58,465
"Various opposition forces
in the Basque region...

1016
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:01,700
have jointly decided
to call a general strike...

1017
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,334
beginning April 30th at 8:00 a.m.

1018
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,580
Students will also participate.

1019
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:10,840
The strike will last a week...

1020
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:13,579
but, if repressed,
it will go on indefinitely."

1021
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:16,487
It's meaningless.

1022
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:20,321
Mumbojumbo, like carrying idols
to make it rain.

1023
01:38:20,427 --> 01:38:24,295
No, I hope that general strike
will really happen.

1024
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:28,164
There will be isolated incidents,
small factions. Nothing big.

1025
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:30,100
It's an unreal action.

1026
01:38:30,204 --> 01:38:33,662
I hope you're wrong.
The general strike will take place!

1027
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:35,639
Isn't this what you all
have wanted for years?

1028
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,803
Isn't that why your comrades
are dead or in prison?

1029
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:42,371
I hope you're wrong. 
I hope you're really blind!

1030
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,876
Things have to change...

1031
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:47,912
so you can go back to Spain.

1032
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:50,483
And so I can go with you.

1033
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,559
So we can finally
have a life together.

1034
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:56,653
Crying and shouting won't help.
That's not going to change reality.

1035
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:03,970
- Shall we go home?
- Yes, let's go home.

1036
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:41,138
What are you doing? 

1037
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:43,707
Nothing.
Just looking at the night.

1038
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:51,410
I must have a child by you, Diego.

1039
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:53,782
Otherwise, I'll go mad.

1040
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:06,330
If I went back to Spain...

1041
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:09,960
if I started all over again from zero,
would you come with me?

1042
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:12,562
To Spain?

1043
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:16,507
You mean, return to Spain, now,
the normal way?

1044
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,510
Under your real identity?

1045
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:22,048
Yes, my real identity.
The normal way.

1046
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:26,711
Anyhow, the place to be is Spain.
That's where things will happen.

1047
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,288
I didn't become an agent
to spend my life in Paris suburbs...

1048
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:32,587
going from one meeting to another.
It's not for me.

1049
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:34,661
Do you think it's possible?

1050
01:40:34,762 --> 01:40:38,198
You think it's possible the police
don't know your true identity?

1051
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:39,993
I'm sure they've heard of Carlos...

1052
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:43,536
but they never heard of Diego Mora.

1053
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:49,072
Well, then, we go to Spain!

1054
01:41:32,886 --> 01:41:34,911
Why did you open the suitcase?

1055
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:37,582
- I don't like lies about these things.
- I didn't lie.

1056
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:40,489
I just asked you to keep
a suitcase for me. That's all.

1057
01:41:41,528 --> 01:41:44,759
- With explosives in it.
- Does that scare you?

1058
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:47,828
Listen...

1059
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,402
I've been handling them
since I was 17.

1060
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:51,664
Me too.

1061
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:58,811
What got you involved with Spain?

1062
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,277
What about you?

1063
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,575
It's my own country!

1064
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:05,549
So no one but you has a right
to get involved with your country?

1065
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:08,314
Every man for himself
in his own little corner, is that it?

1066
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:11,019
Should we confine ourselves
to problems at the university...

1067
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:13,685
or the crisis in the artichoke crop?

1068
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:15,785
I thought we were more
internationalist!

1069
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:19,354
Internationalism means putting
your own country in order first.

1070
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:22,367
Papa lends you his passport,
and I carry suitcases.

1071
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:25,063
Yes, let's talk
about that suitcase.

1072
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:29,307
Here's your father's passport.

1073
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:32,409
- What floor is it?
- Why? Aren't you coming with me?

1074
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:35,573
You go on alone. I'll follow.

1075
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:37,616
You don't trust me?

1076
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:41,179
My comings and goings
are for me to decide.

1077
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:57,131
I gather you don't like cemeteries.

1078
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:01,071
But they clear the view. They bring
a little sunshine into one's life.

1079
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:06,610
What exactly do you stand for?

1080
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:09,375
You don't collect explosives
just for fun.

1081
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:11,781
What's your group, your program?

1082
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:14,615
Leninist Group
for Revolutionary Action.

1083
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:17,087
Everyone's a Leninist these days.

1084
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:20,251
Let's not get bogged down
in a discussion about theory.

1085
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,521
Nadine gave you a suitcase
that belongs to us.

1086
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:25,589
What do you plan
to do with it?

1087
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:27,997
I should have tossed it
in the Seine...

1088
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:31,798
but I'm curious about the tactics
you advocate for Spain.

1089
01:43:32,105 --> 01:43:34,869
I've come here
entirely on my own.

1090
01:43:35,776 --> 01:43:37,869
Explain it to him.

1091
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:44,281
For 25 years, Spain has been
in a latent prerevolutionary state.

1092
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:46,382
To sum it up...

1093
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:50,183
tourism is one of the regime's
main sources of income.

1094
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:52,258
In addition,
millions of people learn...

1095
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,850
to look on Spain
as a normal country.

1096
01:43:54,962 --> 01:43:58,090
For them, Spain is a memory
of a pleasant vacation.

1097
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:01,258
This is an extremely dangerous
political hoax...

1098
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:03,893
demobilizing antifascist action
in Europe.

1099
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:06,495
This is why we must strike a blow
at tourism in Spain!

1100
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:09,974
- Create a climate which will stop it!
- Why not stop the sun too?

1101
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:13,979
We strike at the economy and awaken
proletarian conscience in one blow!

1102
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:18,484
- Because it's asleep?
- Sorry, I didn't mean that.

1103
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:22,077
I say a revolutionary state
exists in Spain, objectively speaking.

1104
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:26,148
But there is no revolutionary
policy or front. Lenin said--

1105
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,558
Lenin's no prayerwheel!

1106
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:31,787
Your peaceful methods amount
to revisionism, pure and simple.

1107
01:44:31,898 --> 01:44:34,526
Objectively speaking, you're following
in the wake of the Spanish bourgeoisie.

1108
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:36,535
- Objectively?
- That's right.

1109
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:41,165
And that's why, for 20 years,
we've been hounded...

1110
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,073
jailed, pushed out of windows, shot...

1111
01:44:44,177 --> 01:44:46,372
and given the stiffest sentences?

1112
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,074
Because, objectively speaking,
we're in the service of the bourgeoisie?

1113
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:52,448
He said "in the wake of,"
not "in the service of."

1114
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:55,353
He was using a political concept.

1115
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:57,320
You turned it
into a moral judgment.

1116
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:58,584
You're right.

1117
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:02,856
We do not question the ability
or the heroism of your members.

1118
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,659
- But we do question your approach.
- For example?

1119
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:10,630
Issuing a new directive
for a general strike on April 30th...

1120
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:12,864
and heading for a new failure.

1121
01:45:16,843 --> 01:45:19,141
You're very sure of yourself.

1122
01:45:19,246 --> 01:45:21,544
I judge from past experience.

1123
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:26,745
Since 1959, every general strike
called in this way has been a failure.

1124
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:30,586
Since 1959?
That's what-- six years?

1125
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:35,762
The validity of a strategic tactic
cannot be judged over so short a period.

1126
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:39,864
You're very impatient
for people engaged in revolution.

1127
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:43,696
Then let's talk
about that suitcase.

1128
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:47,865
Yes, let's! That stupid stunt
nearly got me caught by the cops!

1129
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:51,774
- Or perhaps the other way around?
- Who led the cops to Nadine?

1130
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:57,008
You, the person who used
Rene Sallanches' passport.

1131
01:45:57,117 --> 01:46:00,314
They began to tail us
from Nadine's house because of you.

1132
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:03,715
Because of the incident
at the border.

1133
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:05,792
It's the only reasonable explanation.

1134
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:09,157
The question is,
how long were you tailed...

1135
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:11,287
and did the Spanish police
alert the French?

1136
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:14,561
In any event,
they can't pin anything on us.

1137
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:16,295
We've done nothing.

1138
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:19,395
But all you terrorist groups
get finished off in short order!

1139
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:23,301
What in the hell would I do
with your explosives? Eat them?

1140
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:27,579
You'll find the suitcase in this locker.
Go blow yourselves up!

1141
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:41,224
- You left, just like that!
- I'm late.

1142
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:43,228
Will you give me
a call tonight?

1143
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:47,599
An old woman like me--
You could pay a little more attention!

1144
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:52,071
Call me tomorrow?

1145
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:57,202
Are you leaving?

1146
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:02,313
Will you call me
when you get back?

1147
01:47:06,186 --> 01:47:08,381
You are coming back?

1148
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,435
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. I'll explain.

1149
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:37,381
- Twenty minutes late!
- Okay, okay. I'm here now.

1150
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:41,318
You didn't know Ramon was dead.
They're about to tell you.

1151
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:45,448
He died Sunday night,
a few hours after you saw him.

1152
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:48,621
His heart gave out, as they say.

1153
01:47:48,728 --> 01:47:52,391
Ramon wanted to go to Barcelona
to get away from the routine.

1154
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:55,059
Tricked-up care,
suitcases with false bottoms.

1155
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:56,999
Working in the shadows
for 15 yeare.

1156
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:01,037
Now you're going to go.
You will take his place.

1157
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:04,941
Because the work goes on
and no single death can interrupt it.

1158
01:48:05,045 --> 01:48:08,776
Number 45, third floor right.

1159
01:48:08,882 --> 01:48:13,444
- And the password?
- "The sun rises over Benidorm."

1160
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:32,168
When is the funeral?

1161
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:37,999
We received a letter
from Madrid today.

1162
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,673
Things are not as serious
as they seemed.

1163
01:49:01,101 --> 01:49:04,559
Ramon never saw Spain,
the land of his parents.

1164
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:06,969
You will see the trees of Gerona...

1165
01:49:07,073 --> 01:49:10,236
and the vineyards along the road
with Ramon's eyes.

1166
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:12,777
On this trip you will feel
the delight Ramon would have felt.

1167
01:49:12,879 --> 01:49:16,815
There will be a strike in Madrid as well
on April 30th.

1168
01:49:16,917 --> 01:49:19,477
And on May 1st on the Gran Via!

1169
01:49:19,586 --> 01:49:21,850
You didn't know Ramon was dead.

1170
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:25,755
There were shadows, trees,
sunlight-- and Ramon was dead.

1171
01:49:25,859 --> 01:49:29,761
"Death brings sunshine into your life, "
you were told a while ago.

1172
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:33,390
You laughed, but you should have
shouted at him to shut up...

1173
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:37,266
for Ramon is dead
and his shadow has entered your life...

1174
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:41,830
the shadow of death which has followed
you since the day you were born.

1175
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:48,913
You think to yourself there will be
no strike in Madrid on April 30th...

1176
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:51,313
but you're seized again
by the comradeship of long battles...

1177
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,750
by the stubborn joy
of taking action.

1178
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:56,287
You'll find Juan
and accompany him to Madrid.

1179
01:49:57,157 --> 01:50:00,684
Once again you'll knock on doors,
which strangers will open.

1180
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:04,161
You'll say something, anything--
"The sun is rising over Benidorm "...

1181
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:06,926
or "Almond trees bloom
in Antonio's garden "...

1182
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:11,094
and they'll let you in, and you'll be
together, for those are the passwords.

1183
01:50:12,906 --> 01:50:15,170
You'll see it all with Ramon's eyes:

1184
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:18,073
the sky, the vineyards,
strangers' faces.

1185
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:20,510
All Ramon's joys will be yours...

1186
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:24,516
as if it were your first trip
and the battle were just beginning.

1187
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:29,584
Your buddy's downstairs.
He's waiting with the car.

1188
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:36,892
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

1189
01:50:36,997 --> 01:50:39,830
My name is Chauvin!

1190
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:42,931
My name is Andre Sarlat.

1191
01:50:43,036 --> 01:50:44,560
Mine is Gabriel Chauvin.

1192
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:47,333
Chauvin? Hell of a name!

1193
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:51,744
- We can swap life stories.
- Shall we tell the truth or make it up?

1194
01:50:51,845 --> 01:50:54,746
Make it up.
The truth is of no importance.

1195
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:02,951
We're supposed to make tracks,
so let's make 'em.

1196
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:06,658
You'll have to fill me in on things.
It's my first time.

1197
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,320
You'll see. It's simple.
So let's make tracks.

1198
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:22,338
- Papa came home Sunday.
- The concierge told me it was Monday.

1199
01:51:22,442 --> 01:51:25,138
She's old. She gets confused.

1200
01:51:25,278 --> 01:51:26,745
Indeed.

1201
01:51:26,846 --> 01:51:30,282
Too bad he's not in. I would have liked
to take a look at his passport.

1202
01:51:30,383 --> 01:51:32,874
It's right here.

1203
01:52:01,281 --> 01:52:03,181
Everything's in order.

1204
01:52:04,818 --> 01:52:07,582
Sorry to have disturbed you.

1205
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,994
Politics can be a tricky affair.

1206
01:52:16,096 --> 01:52:19,122
There's more than just smuggling
taking place on the Spanish border.

1207
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:24,192
Last Sunday we received an alert
on a car and its passenger.

1208
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:27,265
The man is wanted in Madrid.

1209
01:52:27,373 --> 01:52:29,273
They let him cross,
along with his French driver...

1210
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:32,071
because they're sure they'll catch him
when he returns.

1211
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:34,442
At least, that's what they say.

1212
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:37,778
But if your father's
passport is here...

1213
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:40,182
it's not wandering around
somewhere else, right?

1214
01:52:40,286 --> 01:52:43,050
Another false tip.

1215
01:52:43,156 --> 01:52:46,216
Anyway, politics are always
a tricky affair.

1216
01:52:46,326 --> 01:52:49,591
Some of these underground
characters...

1217
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:52,858
turn up one day
as cabinet ministers.

1218
01:53:01,407 --> 01:53:04,706
Papa, you must warn your friends!

1219
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:07,046
Domingo's friends.

1220
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:10,012
They came about the passport.

1221
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:12,717
You're right. I'll be right over.

1222
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:23,955
You're lucky, madame.
We just had a cancellation.

1223
01:53:25,698 --> 01:53:29,190
No luggage? You can board
right away. One flight up.

1224
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:32,262
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

1225
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:44,278
All set?

1226
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,281
I've got my ticket.

1227
01:53:46,386 --> 01:53:48,479
Is everything clear?
You remember everything?

1228
01:53:48,588 --> 01:53:49,987
Perfectly.

1229
01:53:50,089 --> 01:53:52,853
The address of the house
and what you have to say?

1230
01:53:52,959 --> 01:53:55,325
Rue Aribau, number 45,
third floor right.

1231
01:53:55,428 --> 01:53:58,864
I ask to speak to Teresa and I say,
"The sun rises over Benidorm."

1232
01:53:58,965 --> 01:54:02,423
That they are not to go to Madrid. That
they are both to come back, right?

1233
01:54:02,535 --> 01:54:05,868
That Juan and he should return
by separate routes.

1234
01:54:05,972 --> 01:54:08,099
Right. That they should come back.

1235
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:12,076
I don't know
why Carlos didn't tell us...

1236
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:14,544
about that incident the other day
at the border.

1237
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:16,672
Anyway, we'll see.

1238
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:20,650
But it will work out.
You have just enough time.

1239
01:54:21,454 --> 01:54:24,184
But it will work out.

1240
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:26,918
Have a good trip.

1241
01:54:29,095 --> 01:54:30,084
Thank you.

1242
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:18,033
THE END
