00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,670
- Hello '?
- Ma-may I speak with Gemma '?

2
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,231
- This is Gemma.
- Gemma '? Gemma, is that really you '?

3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,473
- Gojko '?
- Yes, Gemma. It's me.

4
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,635
- My Gojko '?
- Your Gojko.

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,112
Who called so early this morning '?

6
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,951
Gojko.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,311
From Sarajevo.

8
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,710
He's been trying to reach me
for months, through the Embassy.

9
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,952
They're organizing a show,
to commemorate the Siege.

10
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,236
He asked me to go.

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,354
Some of Diego's photos will be in it.

12
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,316
I have to go to the office,
I have a ton of work to do.

13
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,996
I can't just leave like this.

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,991
I don't know...

15
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,831
Of course you know.

16
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,919
Pietro will never come with me.

17
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,749
But it's a chance for him too.

18
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,871
Here.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,798
Gojko!

20
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,440
- He's still alive.
- He's always been alive.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,991
Mom.

22
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,751
Let's go, Mom.

23
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,471
Pietro I

24
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,554
- Beautiful woman !
- Old woman. - Fuck off !

25
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,678
- You are a rocker.
- I'm a joker.

26
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,671
You liked it '?
- Very much.

27
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,877
- Is there any ice cream '?
- Yeah there is a corner.

28
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,078
How do you say "ice cream"
in Bosnia '? - "Sladoled".

29
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,437
- Chokolada, vanila... - If I just
say ice cream will they understand me'?

30
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,831
Ok. Can I have some money,
please '?

31
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,276
- Wait. Here.

32
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,319
Thank you !

33
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,509
- He's a good kid.
- He's like his father.

34
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,670
Call me, Gemma, any time.

35
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,509
I sleep sitting up...

36
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,631
because if I'm lying down I can feel
my heart in my eyes.

37
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,639
It was easier to run through the
grenades that to walking on ruins.

38
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,311
<i>Gemma '7?</i>

39
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,558
I'm Gojko, your guide.

40
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,316
So, you're doing some research on...
Oh, on Andric.

41
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,756
Yes, for my thesis.

42
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,030
- So, do you have a good place to
stay '? - Yes, a guesthouse. I'm fine.

43
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,715
Don't worry because you could sleep
under a bridge on the Miljacka,

44
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,837
nobody would bother you.

45
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,673
There's not a drunk or thief to be
found these days, you know.

46
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,559
Communist cleanup.

47
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,358
This <i>is</i> the first time we are baring
our ass to the world.

48
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,076
Please.

49
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,118
Olympic Games are about to start

50
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,353
and we have no snow, so,
I'm a little bit worrying.

51
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,559
- Look, I'm here to study Andric <i>s</i>
work. - Ah...

52
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,555
I need someone who can take me to
places related to his life in Bosnia.

53
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,749
Maybe you're not the right person.

54
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,276
I have a car I

55
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,512
- What are you doing '?
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

56
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,275
It's German. The Germans do their
assembly work here, they trust us.

57
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,399
And you want to know why'?
Because we are so precise.

58
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,075
Okay, so maybe we are not so precise
but we sure are cheap.

59
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,911
I pay you very well.

60
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,191
You must be a real whore.

61
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,152
- What '?
- You must be a real whore.

62
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,192
Stop. Stop the car I

63
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,394
What the fuck are you trying to teach
me '? What are you, Italian professor?

64
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,632
Poetry is the art
that listens to human life.

65
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,912
She's crazy I

66
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,398
Poetry... Poetry is God when he feels
nostalgia for men.

67
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,960
It's difficult to translate poetry.

68
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,076
'Alum mo. I

69
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,515
a fist-full of earth falling,
as the gravedigger swears, spits."

70
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,877
Please Gemma, get in.

71
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,032
It's not my car, a friend lent it
to me. I give him half my pay.

72
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,112
Please, please get in,
enough of this.

73
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,835
You bring good luck.

74
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,591
Beautiful Italian woman I

75
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,673
What was the poem about'?

76
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,957
A gravedigger.
He has to bury a poet,

77
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,839
and he curses and smokes
on his grave.

78
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,632
- And spits.
- Yes... yes and spits

79
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,472
I understood something.

80
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,313
It's pronounced just like
it's written,

81
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,552
and the words agree
with others close to them.

82
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,395
For example, if there is a feminine
noun, everything else becomes feminine.

83
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,869
We are very gallant, you know '?

84
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,751
You got married '?

85
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,757
- Yeah.
- Tell me, what is she like '?

86
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,116
I was lucky.

87
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,349
What about the house in Monte
Trebevic'? Is it still there '?

88
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,990
It's covered with mines but...

89
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,073
if you want we can go up there
together and get blown up.

90
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,989
Guys, guys !
Your attention, please.

91
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,152
Let me introduce my Italian friend.

92
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,790
Gemma, this is Zoran, a great mime.
Also known as Kafka.

93
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,589
His father, our local philosopher,
also known as Kant.

94
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,071
This is Bojan, our amazing
saxophone player.

95
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,994
Come on here. Let me introduce to
my Italian friend,

96
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,039
this is Diego, photographer,
American friend. Diego.

97
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,475
“Unequal

98
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,791
This is Mladio, a great sculptor
and he's the craziest of us.

99
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,110
The great actress Ana

100
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,431
A woman everybody wants
and many have had.

101
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,598
I spent the whole day lying in the
snow with skiers jumping over me,

102
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,638
ice chips flying in my eyes.

103
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,712
I'm probably going to go blind. It's
not a great idea for a photographer

104
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,792
But I don't understand why you didn't
wear sunglasses.

105
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,191
Dammit!

106
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,318
No, that's like making love
with your clothes on.

107
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,199
Nothing can come between you
and the lens.

108
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,511
Here.

109
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,835
God that laugh.

110
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,956
- Are you seeing someone '?
- I have been someone for many years.

111
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,639
- What about you '?
- Me '?

112
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,549
I'm free I

113
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,634
I'm free !
Drop everything and run away with me.

114
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,797
Mmhm, where to '?

115
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,716
Brasil. Photograph children
who work in these mines in Camaru.

116
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,791
I was going to leave tomorrow.

117
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,836
I was so happy,
but now I'm so sad.

118
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,796
I'm also leaving tomorrow.

119
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,076
- Excuse me, Mirna Mari '?
- Room 13.

120
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,791
"Mama" '?

121
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,271
"Mama..."

122
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,590
May I take her '?

123
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,997
Be careful with her head.

124
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,672
Allow me to introduce myself,
young lady.

125
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,391
I'm your brother, Gojko.
And I'll also be your father,

126
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,836
in the memory of our recently
departed dad.

127
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,472
What is it '?

128
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,518
My mother wants to thank you
for giving me work.

129
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,592
Very good.

130
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,759
She asked if you'd like to hold
the baby.

131
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,591
Oh, she is so sweet.

132
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,951
So small.

133
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,791
Do you want children'?

134
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,551
Now"?

135
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,750
It's all I want.

136
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,190
Come on, Come on,
Welcome to my house.

137
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,071
Principessa italiana can sleep here.

138
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,118
You, photographer
you will sleep in my room.

139
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,398
Don't worry, sheets are clean enough,
and I'll sleep on the couch.

140
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,871
- Tell me.
- Our poet has fallen asleep.

141
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,033
- Okay, good night.
- No, I'm in love with you.

142
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,353
- You are crazy. - I, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

143
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,796
- Okay. How old are you '?
- Twenty-three.

145
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,396
Nice poem, Gojko, congratulations.

146
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,038
Alana.

147

No!Go!

Till!!!"-

151
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,794
There's a trattoria nearby,
I used to bring you mother there.

152
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,871
They make such a carbonara...

153
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,590
Let's run away.

154
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,752
I'm happy, Dad I I'm convinced.

155
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,117
And the other one, the American '?
The night caller '?

156
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,115
- There's no one else.
- Then... no carbonara.

- You're crazy, crazy. - I told you
I'd be in Rome in no time.

159
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,031
You cannot stay here. This is my
father's house. I just got divorced.

160
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,997
Yes I

161
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,755
That's okay. I can take care of myself
I already got a place to stay anyway.

162

- Armando '?
- Diego ! How was your trip, Diego '?

163
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,073
Oh, it was great !
I took your advice.

- I followed a road, the...
- Aurelia ! - Aureelia, yeah.

I got a present for you.

166
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,272
It's from my childhood,
from when I was a baby.

167
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,355
Hey, look, I haven't changed a bit,
it still fits.

168
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,829
My ass is the same size.

169
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,231
You happy to see me '?

170
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,474

Maybe just a little bit '?

- Diego. You are a photographer '?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm a photographer.

173
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,039
Eh, you work in weddings,
advertising '?

174
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,114
- Puddles mostly.
- Puddles. Yeah.

175
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,277
- Interesting, eh '?

176
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,149
May I have the honor of taking your
daughter off to dinner tonight'?

177
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
Of course, Diego.

178
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,756
WWII
WWII

179
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,956
But do you think I really want
to live here'?

180
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,431
No, it belongs to a friend,
a guy I met in Brazil.

181
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,311
This way.

182
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,310
All for you my love.

183
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,751
Come on.

184
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,834
What perfume are you wearing '?

185
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,550
Juniper shower gel.

186
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,231
Sit.

187
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,718
Sorry, I forgot
my dress shirts at home.

188
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,397
- These are cemetery candles. - It's
all they had at the supermarket.

189
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,874
- When did you take these photos '?
- Did you forget '?

190
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,393
Have you thought about what
to do for a living '?

191
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,360
There's lots of little old ladies that
need a nice portrait for tombstone.

192
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,431
- That won't take us very far.
- No, but we're already here.

193
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,519
Everyday will be a party with me baby.
I promise.

194
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,630
How can you always be so happy '?

195
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,917
I can't stand being sad.

196
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,351
I love you Gemma.

197
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,552
- The night at Gojkds house '?
- Yeah.

198
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,109
I got pregnant.

199
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,798
Jesus Christ, Gemma.
And you didn't even tell me'?

200
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,836
I lost it immediately.
It never even had a heartbeat.

201
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,517
It was lifeless,
like a blind eye.

202
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,160
My grandmother was blind.
She was a schoolteacher.

203
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,836
One day she was riding her bike
and she fell in the river.

204
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,949
My grandfather fished her out.

205
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,918
He was younger than her, and they spent
the rest of their lives together.

206
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,077
The weirdest love stories
are always the best.

207
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,272
This, right here,
this is the spot you know.

208
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,429
This is where everything comes from,
where everything's born.

209
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,076
It's our destiny, you know.
The river of life

210
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,111
The river of life.

211
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,551
You want to know the truth '?
He looks like you

212
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,998
He walks like you
and he's moody like you.

213
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,796
- Did I ever tell you how much I was
in love with you'? - You never did.

214
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,269
But you two were so in love.

215
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,234
You were so in love with him.

216
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,032
Pietro, be careful I

217
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,751
Is this Diego's '?

218
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,119
It's nice !
It looks like a cool CD cover.

219
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,312
- No, I don't think it's your dad's.
- Dad '?

220
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,835
What a drag with this story I

221
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,079
The first photo of your son.
Sorry you could not take it yourself.

222
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,151
Pietro I

223
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,636
- I love him already.
- Diego, we have no money.

224
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,237
No,no,no!
Today I got paid.

225
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,998
You can't ride a motor scooter anymore.

226
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,756
And you... You have to listen
to Mozar, Beethoven, Bach !

227
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,792
Pink Floyd. No I
Pink Floyd. No I

228
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,557
You're a mother now, a temple

229
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,359
and I'm a monk
who kneels before you.

230
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,800
Come on, son, faster.
Time for a new life.

231
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,271
You need to take care
of your body now.

232
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,957
No more alcohol, no more cigarettes
and no more pot.

233
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,473
Enough!

234
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,118
- Italian Fascist !
- Shut up !

235
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,238
A spineless American,
that's what you are I

236
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,553
- There, smoke, smoke ! - How did you
manage to win all those wars '?

237
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,035
Shit I

238
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,758
it was a blighted ovum,
the body expels them naturally.

239
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,831
You were lucky.

240
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,677
The hemorrhage saved you from a D&C.

241
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,671
What did he say '?

242
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,394
He said I was lucky.

243
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,074
Just means it wasn't Pietro, sweetie.

244
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,951
The children who are meant to come,
will come. Gemma, they'll come.

245
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,953
Look ! Oh, get some fresh air in here.
Look, this is our bedroom.

246
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,951
Really sweet, look.

247
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,637
Oh, and a dark room, a perfect dark
room or maybe even a nursery.

248
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,315
Got a music room or maybe
even a dance hall.

249
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,597
God, so much space, so spacious,
the windows.

250
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,549
Look over here too.
Slip and slide.

251
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,636
Behind you is the kitchen.

252
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,076
It's our new life, Gemma

253
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,511
My love.

254
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,993
I'll be right here honey I'm not going
anywhere 0k '? Think about me !

255
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,994
Think about us 0k '?
I love you Gemma, I love you.

256
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,596
You're my sparkling Gemma
little flower bud !

257
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,594
WWII

258
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,877
- I'll make it this time!
- Good morning, Gemma.

259
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,638
Don't worry, Gemma,
relax

260
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,509
and think about something
beautiful, think about the sea.

261
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,159
I'm so sorry I'm late there was
so much fucking traffic.

262
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,038
Beautiful.

263
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,035
Sally.

264
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,113
I'm afraid that your eggs are
incompatible with life.

265
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,794
Your sterility factor is rated at 97%.

266
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,311
We consider that total sterility.

267
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,911
What about the 3% '?

268
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,390
Miracles I

269
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,838
Miracles do happen.
This is Italy after all.

270
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,798
You can live also without children,
Gemma.

271
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,036
Adoption is a lengthy process,
a real ordeal for the mind and soul.

272
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,590
The last test of your shortcomings.

273
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,674
As your psychologist
my responsibility

274
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,276
is to discourage you.

275
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,550
Having a child has become
an obsession.

276
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,314
I see pregnant women everywhere,

277
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,836
They are like an army walking
towards me.

278
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,677
Do you really want me to be honest '?

279
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,231
I'm not here to prove to you
that I am a good person.

280
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,312
I'm here because I'm afraid.

281
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,517
I'm afraid of losing the man I love.

282
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,278
I want to give him a child
to tie him to me

283
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,956
with this padlock of flesh.

284
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,034
What does truth taste like'?

285
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,911
Awful.

286
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,711
Better.

287
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,631
When my father beat my mother
I'd go hide in the closet.

288
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,918
I'd just keep telling myself
"Think about something beautiful".

289
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,150
I'd piss in my pants.

290
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,789
But I wouldn't come off until
I heard my mother washing her face

291
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,759
and going into the kitchen
and start frying eggs.

292
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,754
And then I'd come off and smile
as if to say,

293
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,270
"it's 0k ma'. I didn't hear a thing,
all I saw was a beautiful thing".

294
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,072
When my father died,

295
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,916
when they lifted up the container
there wasn't really anything

296
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,119
it was just a puddle of shrimp
marmalade and my father floating in it.

297
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,838
That was when I took
my first photograph.

298
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,600
And then I started using heroine.

299
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,834
Heroine was a beautiful thing, it was
a thing that took away all the pain.

300
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,717
All of a sudden soccer fields
seemed like the Maracanã stadium

301
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,555
and my ugly mug didn't seem so bad.

302
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,949
And then I met Gemma.

303
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,512
The only, truly beautiful thing
in my life.

304
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,036
I want a child with his eyes,
with his neck.

305
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,354
Do you think there is a child like
that somewhere'?

306
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,512
The police has given a negative
evaluation.

307
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,437
Your criminal record Diego,
the drugs and all the rest,

308
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,080
there was nothing I could do.

309
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,357
Your request has been refused.

310
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,351
I'm sorry.

311
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,749
I'm just...
I'm so sorry.

312
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,310
It couldn't have happened to a more
deserving couple.

313
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,115
Hey, how are you'? Are you 0k '?
What do you need '?

314
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,192
A case of Brunello di Montalcino.

315
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,556
- Gojko, senti, how are you,
how is Sebina'?

316
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,837
Ah, Sebina <i>is</i> fine, <i>she's</i> always
jumping all over the place.

317
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,639
Listen put her on a plane,
send her to us.

318
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,519
No, no, relax, there is no war here.

319
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,353
No one will ever touch Sarajevo.

320
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,313
Did you like the photos '?

321
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,309
Were you there '?
Were you always with him '?

322
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,471
Not always.

323
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,956
- And where was I '?
- You weren't born yet.

324
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,554
- Weren't you scared '?
- Of what '?

325
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,759
You were pregnant. Weren't you scared
of being pregnant in a war '?

326
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,798
My shoes are wet !
I've caught a cold.

327
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,753
Legs up I Shake them fast.

328
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,195
Make the lights flicker.

329
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,591
Let's change position, the other way.

330
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,552
Fast, fast I

331
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,151
One day you'll find somebody
with good ovaries,

332
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,473
someone young and healthy
and you'll have a child with her.

333
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,517
What the fuck are you talking about'?

334
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,911
I'll bring you little presents,
I'll play the aunt.

335
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,431
Shoes with lights...

336
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,350
And I'll forgive you
because I care for you too much.

337
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,798
Well, I don't "care" for you too much,
I love you.

338
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,158
We have to learn to live
without children.

339
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,870
- It's easy for you to say.
- No. It's not.

340
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,397
Diego you can have a child whenever
you want, with whoever you want.

341
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,711
Fine I'll get spade, like a cat.

342
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,555
I don't know what the fuck to do
with my balls anymore anyway.

343
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,078
I mean I'm sick of earning money
for nothing.

344
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,118
I'm of no use to you any more,
I don't know how to make you happy.

345
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,829
Are you fucking the stylist?

346
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,434
Maybe we should split up.

347
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,079
- Bye kids !
- Bye !

348
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,429
So it's true that,
life speaks through light.

349
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,789
You know who we'll take these to '?

350
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,150
So guys.
This is the radio station.

351
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,709
I do a night poetry show.

352
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,196
I fuck like a mule these days.

353
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,516
- Hey. Kafka! (off) What's up!
- Diego, I have something for you !

354
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,672
Hello Ana.

355
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,832
It's our communal house.

356
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,112
Come on, what did you cook
for my friends, mama'?

357
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,073
My mom is the great cook!

358
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,595
It's plenty of electricity, you know.

359
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,991
You're wonderful I

360
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,751
Beautiful, Sebina.

361
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,837
This way we will always be able
to find you,

362
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,631
even in the dark.

363
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,675
She is not studying at all, she is all
the time training at the gym.

364
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,277
She wants to become
next Nadia Comaneci.

365
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,595
Son of a bitch I Do I always have
to listen to him '? Turn it off!

366
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,752
How can every anyone be afraid
of an ass like him '?

367
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,797
It's the assholes you have
to be afraid of.

368
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,998
He changed the menus in the
restaurants the street names!

369
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,153
For them it's enough to fart and they
think their ass in supporting them.

370
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,279
Yeah, the propaganda people, first
come propaganda and then history.

371
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,069
No, it's one thing to... convince
a peasant that his Turkish neighbor

372
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,118
wants to cut his throat,

373
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,750
but there aren't any Turks here
or Cetnics, or Ustascia.

374
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,437
Yeah that's what I'm talking about,
because here we are all Sarajevans !

375
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,230
- Poets, artists, lawyers.
- Wars start in the villages.

376
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,350
- Wars start in the soccer stadiums,

377
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,559
while you guys haul yourselves up
in artist's colonies and write poetry.

378
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,512
- But you're not scared '?
- We are together.

379
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,592
That's what matters.
Ah, ja.

380
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,191
What is the smell like '?

381
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,071
Milk.

382
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,835
Or the forest.

383
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,311
They are both biologists, he is
professor, she was his assistant.

384
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,234
They rent off a room and he's a jew,
she's a muslim

385
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,436
but don't worry you'll be comfortable.

386
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,753
Welcome. Please take off your shoes.

387
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,398
Good morning.
Do you have international newspapers '?

388
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,915
Newspaper '? Yes !

389
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,793
Thank you. "Le Monde".

390
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,032
How are you, Professor '?

391
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,752
And when are you two going
to have a baby

392
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,630
Come on, the yankee can't '?

393
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,672
If you need a little help, c'mon,
here I am.

394
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,476
I'm sterile, Gojko.

395
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,311
Sterile.

396
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,511
Beautiful woman...

397
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,480
We are a luckless generation.

398
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,599
I wanted a child with these feet.

399
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,270
I wanted to see him walking in front
of us.

400
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,791
I lost.

401
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,118
- Why don't you come too '?
- Do you like her '? - No.

402
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,794
I like Italian girls!

403
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,556
- Let's go, Pietro.
- Come on. - Go, go.

404
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,235
Leave her alone, we will have fun,
the three of us. Let's go.

405
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,238
Be careful on the slides I

406
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,072
Be careful I

407
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,719
MW!

408
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,598
You be careful too.

409
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,838
- Who's that girl '? - Kurt Kobain.
- Kurt Kobain '?

410
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,196
And who the heck is that '?

411
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,153
- Do you like Nirvana'? I listen
to them in the dark every night.

412
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,232
They blow me away.

413
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,598
- Where exactly do they blow you to '?
- Somewhere you'll never go.

414
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,277
- Idiot !
- Fuck you!

415
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,672
Nirvana is just a bunch of fucking
nihilist millionaires.

416
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,274
- Screw you !
- Shut up !

417
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,995
So what are your intentions, Aska?

418
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,310
To play music.
One of the guys in Nirvana is Croatian.

419
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,631
If he made it, so can I.

420
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,109
I want to go to London.

421
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,591
That's why I need the money.

422
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,117
Gojko told me

423
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,750
you are looking for a roda, a stork.

424
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,674
I want to be paid in deutsche marks.

425
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,713
- Will you do it only for money '?
- What do you want me to say '?

426
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,471
That I'm doing it for love '?

427
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,596
- Are you muslim '?
- Sometimes I read the Koran.

428
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,120
And what does the Koran say '? You can
rent your body to another woman '?

429
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,830
The Koran says to help other people

430
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,314
I'm happy to help a woman
who's defective.

431
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,516
We all have to give something back.

432
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,071
If you think about it, even the Virgin
Mary lent her womb to God the Father.

433
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,040
Aska doesn't exactly strike
my as the Virgin Mary.

434
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,477
Every once in a while God points
his finger at someone and says

435
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,200
"You, come with me."

436
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,271
You can't say no to God.

437
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,149
He plants himself inside of us,
opens our soul.

438
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,471
Kurt Kobain does drugs
so he can deal with God.

439
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,152
How can I be sure you,
you won't decide to keep the baby '?

440
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,754
Easy. Families make me sick.

441
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,476
Downhill"

442
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,318
My test results.
No, I don't have AIDS.

443
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,278
Hi.

444
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,913
My boyfriend and I can't have
intercourse,

445
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,029
I have these bad muscle spasms so,
it's basically impossible, you know.

446
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,590
- Muscle spasms.
- Artificial insemination.

447
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,035
Yeah, that. Whatever you call it.

448
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:38,150
We have to do some tests first
in order to monitor your ovulation

449
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,871
and then your partner
will have to...

450
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,877
Doctor...
I'm sorry...

451
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,510
We have to go.
Everybody is running away !

452
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,597
What's up '? Where are you going '?

453
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,751
Where the fuck are you going '?
Cowards, traitors, motherfuckers I

454
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,629
Your mother is a bitch I

455
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,190
Get out, son of a bitch I

456
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,920
What's happening, guys '?

457
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,152
Where <i>is</i> everybody going '?
Fuck you, assholes !

458
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,880
Go, run away !
Motherfuckers, get out of town !

459
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,960
- How about a hot chocolate at my
place '?

460
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,758
LISP-

461
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,911
Thank you, grandmother.

462
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,757
If you want we can do it naturally,
you know '?

463
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,829
I don't have problems with sex.

464
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,033
You can watch if you want.
Like in a laboratory

465
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,476
Zic, zic, zic, zik...

466
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,439
Like rabbits I

467
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,478
Hey what's so fucking funny you two'?

468
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,551
What the fuck.

469
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,078
No!

470
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,191
I don't think so.

471
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,355
She's not going to come.

472
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,753
Good morning.

473
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,918
I don't know if you remember,
I was here with my husband,

474
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,991
before the war,

475
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,271
he was a photographer.

476
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,592
A lot of photographers came here I

477
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,917
May I take a look around '?

478
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,356
Of course. Please.

479
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,551
Who are you '? Their maid of honor '?

480
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,478
Hi!

481
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,631
Sorry I'm late.
It's a zoo off there

482
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,872
with the demonstrations and all.

483
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,672
Let's hope I still have
a few eggs left.

484
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,116
Are you staying '?

485
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,278
No.

486
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,349
Bye.

487
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,594
So are they fucking those two '?

488
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,357
"And the life laughs at us
like a toothless old whore

489
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,239
while we fuck her
with our eyes closed,

490
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,278
dreaming of the ass of lilly."

491
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,791
Do I stink '?

492
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,678
No.

493
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,111
You smell good.

494
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,669
Let's go make love
once before we die.

495
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,909
We're not going to die, Gojko.

496
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,112
Yes... Yeah, I was at the Water Park.
I'll pass you mom.

497
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,758
No, <i>she's</i> asleep,
yes, <i>she's</i> asleep...

498
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,039
Talk to you tomorrow, bye Dad.

499
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,111
What's this morgue '?

500
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,954
What's this morgue, I said !
What did you do '?

501
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,510
I walked a lot, I'm tired.
Leave me alone.

502
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,480
You were alone all day !
All day !

503
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,519
My friends are all at the beach,
in Sardinia swimming in the sea.

504
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,958
Look where I am I
In this shithole I

505
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,715
Where you brought me,
in this shit city !

506
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,078
That's where I am,
look at this great city of yours !

507
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,151
Look where I am I

508
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,029
Give me the lotion,
I'm all sunburned.

509
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,191
Look for it yourself.

510
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,998
What did you do to your feet '?
They're filthy !

511
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,316
- You hurt me, Pietro.
- Why don't you want to talk to dad '?

512
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,950
- Why don't you want to talk to dad '?
- Leave me alone.

513
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,079
Yeah, who do you think you are '?

514
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,117
You never go to the Officers' Club,

515
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,239
you don't sit
with the other Carabinieri wives.

516
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,757
Sure, laugh !
You've always been ashamed of dad !

517
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,992
- What are you saying '?
- You didn't come here for me.

518
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,755
You come here for this fucking Diego !
Not for me !

519
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,956
For this fucking Diego I

520
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,715
Why don't you try calling him
dad, just once '?

521
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:11,480
Climb down, Gemma!
Climb down, because you're a nobody !

522
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,271
Pietro I

523
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,351
The chickens are all dead.

524
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,271
What '?

525
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,271
Aska '?

526
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,160
Nothing happened, no, I'm sorry.

527
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,391
We have to get off of here.

528
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,879
Here they are, my stars !

529
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,791
Darling, hi.

530
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,951
They're just back from Sarajevo,
Diego took some incredible shots.

531
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,793
Listen, is what I read true
that the paring knives

532
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,875
for pitting olives are used
to gouge people's eyes out '?

533
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:29,393
"Ladies and gentlemen,
enjoy Sarajevo !"

534
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,831
Till!!!"-

535
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,871
Hi, my love.

536
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,549
How are you '? Tired '?

537
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,196
How did it go '? How was it '?

538
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,029
Who the fuck do you think was there '?
Do you know what I did today '?

539
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,590
I spent the entire day photographing

540
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,672
a can of tuna.

541
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,269
And once it was open
and once it was close, an '?

542
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,236
Again and again.

543
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,631
They even had a make-up artist for it,
for the fuckin tuna !

544
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,279
She kept on moving it back
and forth between dressing rooms,

545
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,193
like it was a fucking model.

546
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,719
The world is going to hell baby.

547
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,476
And we're going down with it.

548
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,551
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

549
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,077
- Grandpa, going to war '?
- Mind your fucking business.

550
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,991
Good morning, Gemma.

551
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,471
Where is he '?

552
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,671
Dad!

553
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,674
I hate this passport, mom.

554
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,035
When they ask me why I was born
in Sarajevo, I'm ashamed.

555
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,909
"By mistake", I say.

556
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,751
By mistake.

557
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,516
My dear friend Zoran, he was the
greatest wheelchair pilot ever.

558
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,520
There's no one better than him.

559
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,233
Today he took his father for a ride
across that open street intersection.

560
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,992
His old man always used to say:
"Son let's race".

561
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,072
"See if that prick on a hill
can shoot me."

562
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,999
Zoran was a great mime
and when he was shot

563
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,549
he fell like an artist.

564
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,314
He loved U2,
Levis 501's and Kafka.

565
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,712
May you rest in peace, dear friend.

566
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,038
You can't get real flowers anymore,

567
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,759
so the florist in Markale started
making paper ones.

568
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,394
Look, the light of life I Thank you I

569
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,717
Not eating was bad,
but not smoking was a crime!

570
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,193
How did you remember this '?
Thank you !

571
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,996
Thank you Gemma.

572
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,238
Hey, come here ! Come here !
Come on !

573
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,599
I knew you were following us.

574
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,109
I knew you were there.

575
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,591
We made love that night,

576
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,274
and again after that.

577
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,669
Do you love her '?

578
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,879
How can I not'?

579
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,031
And me '?

580
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,829
Thanks, lunch was very good.
I'm going now.

581
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,911
- Where '? - To the University.
There's no more University, Jovan.

582
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,233
I know, I'm going to see
if there is anything I can do.

583
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,118
Enjoy your meal.

584
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,716
I need to talk to Aska.

585
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,316
Call your father,
have him send all the money he can.

586
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,992
I'm talking to you.

587
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,079
I'm talking to you !
Who do you think you are '?

588
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,237
Who the fuck do you think you are I

589
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:41,997
Here he <i>is</i> !
Jesus Christ <i>is</i> here !

590
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,993
Jesus Christ is here I

591
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,269
Where are you going '?

592
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,629
Where are you taking that '?
Why don't you bring me some food '?

593
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,839
I'm tired! I'm hungry!
Bastard !

594
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:13,555
My love !
This is what you call love '?

595
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,870
WWII

596
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,797
I'll give you this fucking baby.

597
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,075
As long as a sniper doesn't
get it first

598
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,478
What do you think of this
beautiful city

599
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,517
surrounded by cemeteries,
eh, Pietro '?

600
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,955
The square with the chessboard
is cool.

601
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,715
That square with the chessboard
is for pathetic old veterans.

602
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:42,398
Piazza Navona is so much better.
Yeah, Piazza Navona.

603
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,351
You are lucky.

604
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,273
You're Italian.

605
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,800
LISP-

606
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,280
You are lucky, Pietro.

607
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,277
Are you waiting for two more '?

608
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,158
I want to go home, mom,
back to Rome.

609
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,832
Come on, Francesco Totti !

610
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,511
Pass me that ball.

611
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,638
Take it I

612
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,878
Stand up !

613
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,833
Come on!

614
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,069
It's not a foul, get up.

615
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,638
It's not a foul, get, get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up !

616
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:02,712
- Are you a signorina or what '?
- Stop !

617
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,596
You're hurting him.

618
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,191
You're hurting my son.

619
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,835
Oh, such a good Italian mama.

620
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,878
What do you want '?

621
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,871
Baby is coming.

622
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:54,672
Breath! Breath I

623
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,115
Breath! Breath I

624
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,791
Cigarette I

625
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,790
This baby is going to stink
of nicotine and of Sarajevo.

626
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,957
Breath deep, breath deep,
breath deep, breath deep

627
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,317
His birth certificate. Nobody bothers
to check the paperwork these days.

628
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,990
You are his mother, Gemma.

629
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,434
Go ! Go ! It's 0k, it's 0k.
Go! Go !

What '? What '?

634
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,431
Madame... the Captain wants to know
if you'd like a ride to Rome.

635
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,758
I got you a sandwich,
something to drink.

636

I'll hold him, I had some nephews.
He's beautiful !

Did you give birth in Sarajevo '?

640
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,676
What courage I

641
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:24,550
- Excuse me, the baby's father '?
- He lost his passport.

642
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:30,199
Captain '? What's up '?
- How many measures do I put '?

643
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:33,830
Read the instructions.

What's the name '?

645
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,719
- Pietro.
- No, your name.

646
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:47,398
- Gemma.
- Bless you, Gemma.

647
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,637
He's a beautiful baby.

648
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,313
He looks like you.

649
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,675
Boys look like their mothers.

650
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,151
He drank it all.

651
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,911
Pietro.

01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,671
Dirty boy I
Dirty boy I

653
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,398
<i>- m, ma,
- m.</i>

654
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,511
The man who called
thought I was his father.

655
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,960
He fell from a cliff into the sea.

656
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,680
There's no sea in Sarajevo.

657
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,838
"Bread" ! Come here.
Let's go.

658
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,437
Weren't you supposed
to go towards the sea '?

659
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:23,469
Pietro's complaining, the food's crap.
He wants to come home.

660
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,349
Where are you '?

661
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,151
In the hotel.
Looking out the window.

662
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,631
Should I tell him '?

663
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,669
Should I tell him
I'm not his mother'?

664
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,997
Don't run away, Gemma.

665
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,472
- What shall we steal, mom '?
- What '?

666
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:08,719
If you don't steal something,
it means you didn't like the place.

667
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,757
Who said such a stupid thing '?

668
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:14,276
- A Carabinieri Colonel.
- Dad '? Yes !

669
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:19,116
Or rather...
do you know what I'll steal '?

670
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,113
Classic... Look how beautiful I

674
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,272
Indeed... Indeed...

<i>Who? - Who?

01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,633
I told you already I

Come here. - Give me a kiss.

680
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,591

681

You are so beautiful I

682
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,670
You scratched me.

683
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,880
Mom had gone up to the roof
to hang the laundry,

684
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:36,991
it was a sunny day,
the sirens sounded.

685
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,471
Sebina went down to the basement
with the others.

686
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,235
It must have been some sixth sense.

687
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:50,913
They went looking for each other
at exactly the same time.

688
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,712
My mother left her laundry
on the roof

689
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,556
and started down the stairs, just
as Sebina was coming up to find her.

690
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,429
And the blast hit them both,
right as they found each other.

691
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,474
The womb and its fruit.

692
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,950
Sebina didn't die right away.

693
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,076
She was a gymnast.

694
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,636
She wanted to win the gold medal
in the Olympics.

695
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,158
I'll get you the best artificial
legs in the world, I told her.

696
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:36,114
Someone found one of her sneakers,
the ones that light up.

697
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,636
So I made the stupidest
bet with myself:

698
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,150
as long as this sneaker flashes
she will be alive.

699
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,271
And I lost.

700
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,355
You know who should talk about
this war, Pietro '?

701
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,391
A comedian,

702
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,240
someone like Buster Keaton.

703
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,760
Are you happy with your husband '?

704
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,838
Yin.

705
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,873
It's a different type of love,
but I'm happy.

706
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,951
But I'm happy-

707
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,589
Love only comes once.

708
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:57,399
It moves like the sea,
but it's always the same.

709
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,831
Nice woman.

710
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:06,113
Let me be, I'm old.

711
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:13,230
You'll never be old Gemma,
time only brings off your beauty.

712
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,791
What about you '?
Are you happy with your wife '?

713
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,275
We have a little girl.

714
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,957
We run a restaurant,
it's a cultural association.

715
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,190
Do you still write poetry '?

716
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,229
Ladies, my friends from Italy,
say "Buongiorno" to them.

717
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,312
- "Buongiorno".
- Good Morning.

718
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:15,113
- Gemma '?
- Ana '? Ana ! - Gemma!

719
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,312
- No! Don't tell me! You two...
- Are you kidding '?

720
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,995
I never would have married this ox.

721
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:30,393
- She married me !
- Mladjo ! - Gemma ! Gemma !

722
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,393
Yes, Gemma, and then we got divorced.

723
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,437
She was cheating on me.

724
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,876
You were cheating on me, you bastard.

725
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,270
You were crazy Mladio,
the craziest of us all.

726
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,113
Top of the list,
but God didn't want me.

727
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,033
Yes, he's still crazy Gemma,
that's why I dumped him

728
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:05,956
- This is Sebina. - Hi.
- Gemma. This is Pietro.

729
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,476
- Hi, Pietro.
- Hi, Sebina.

730
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,316
<i>Hi, Gemma.</i>

731
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,071
Ail...

732
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:10,990
Sorry, I wanted to tell you right away,
but I couldn't.

733
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,111
What is this '?

734
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,394
Now I understand everything.

735
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,352
The whole trip,
the whole thing has been a set up.

736
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,829
What do you want '?

737
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,636
What do you want '?

738
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,076
To see him.

739
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,834
Look off the window, he's right there.

740
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:49,470
- He's with his sister.
- Please shut up.

741
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,356
What do you want '? Do you want money '?

742
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,995
I will pay. It's no problem,
I've been paying my whole life.

743
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,077
I gave money to every
single refugee I met.

744
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,959
I took out my wallet and paid.

745
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,515
I'm an Italian citizen.

746
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,594
<i>F" MM.'</i>

747
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,195
I'm going to leave this house now,
and I'm going to take him with me.

748
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,797
Because he's my son,
do you hear me '?

749
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,269
<i>He's my son.</i>

750
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:21,079
I thought you were dead, or off of
your mind, crazy, locked in some place.

751
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,397
But here you are,

752
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:30,475
Young and beautiful,
still having children.

753
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,839
Do you still listen to Nirvana '?

754
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,356
- Kurt Cobain is dead.
- Why didn't you die '?

755
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,554
Let me tell you the story.

756
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:04,077
Are we going to make
this baby or what '?

757
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,597
They're frying fritters downstairs,
go get me some.

758
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,671
I'm hungry.

759
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,478
No, no, please !
I have a wife and a son !

760
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,115
Please !
I have a wife and a son ! Please !

761
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:43,512
She has a perforated eardrum

762
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:49,630
and calcified fracture in her shoulder,

763
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:53,873
but no internal damage,
she's a strong woman.

764
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:59,558
Her orifices will heal slowly,

765
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,473
it will take some time.

766
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:09,919
I'm ashamed to belong
to the human race.

767
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:14,593
God will not forgive us,

768
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,949
not even the children.

769
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,151
Where were you hiding '?

770
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,031
- They should shoot me in the belly

771
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,476
and kill this piece of shit they made.

772
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,077
I'll tell my wife the baby's mine,
and you won't even have to see it.

773
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,517
And then you can get away from here,
away from this place.

774
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,789
You could start playing again.

775
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:04,910
No, my love. I'll never play again.

776
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,109
Are you sure '?

777
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,751
Yin.

778
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:29,629
Take him away.

779
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,391
A little bit of ink between
you and your destiny.

780
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:05,431
A little dose of courage.

781
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,111
What is it '?

782
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,631
Alan.

783
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:17,469
I can't see it.

784
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:38,751
This is where life comes from.

785
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,471
Are you ready '?

786
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,031
Yin.

787
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,836
Mm!!!-

788
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,549
Ready to live.

789
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,913
- What is the most beautiful word
for you '? - For me '? - Si.

790
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:09,199
Tennis. And for you '?

791
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:12,511
- Freedom.
- Freedom, uuh. - Yes.

792
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:15,592
- Would you like to be a musician '?
- No.

793
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,311
I want to build a 7-stars hotel, yeah.

794
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:25,271
With a suite, with a complete golf
course inside, yeah. Big, really big.

795
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,398
The biggest.

796
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,790
But probably I will be a philosopher,
yeah.

797
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,631
Pietro.

798
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:58,755
For me the most beautiful word
is "grazie".
