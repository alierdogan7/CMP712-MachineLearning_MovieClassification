1
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,293
All right, this is what's going on.

2
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,995
Me, O'Bizzle-- O'Bizzle.

3
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,196
- l got it, l got it, man l'm the narrator.
- O'Bizzle fo' shizzle.

4
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:55,138
Me, Peebs, and Kim.

5
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,540
Kim, you got something to say?

6
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,635
- Yeah, you got something to say.
- Kim?

7
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:04,881
You all know tonight
is going to going to be crazy.

8
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:06,748
Stupid crazy.

9
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,946
What's your sole mission, O'Byrne?

10
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,489
Man, to keep you out of hand.

11
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:15,254
You can't--you can't tame the beast.

12
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,626
Peebs, tell them. How do we roll?

13
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:20,757
Got 'em. Got 'em.

14
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,461
Tune in next time
where we're going to be still loving life

15
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:26,437
and getting ready to go to war.

16
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:28,440
- What?
- All right, baby.

17
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:30,840
- War, Afghanistan, what?
- Say it again, baby, say it again.

18
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,844
- l didn't even sign my passport.
- Baby.

19
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,403
- l didn't even sign my passport.
- We're going to war. We're going to war.

20
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,472
We're going to war. We're going to war.

21
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,778
Roger.

22
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:38,709
Oh, we're fucking hit.

23
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:40,905
- This is an lED, over.
- lED.

24
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,312
- Keep going, keep going! Keep--
- What was that?

25
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,316
- Shots.
- Eight o'clock.

26
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:47,852
- Get on that gun!
- What are we doing?

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,855
Aim for that draw! Right now!

28
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,390
That way.

29
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,654
We gotta get out. We gotta get out of here.

30
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,322
We're getting out!

31
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:01,332
Fucking motherfucker.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,995
Shot, eight o'clock. 300 meters.

33
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:08,905
Shot, eight o'clock. 102 meters.

34
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,304
You know what?

35
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,932
When they told me
l was going to the Korengal Valley,

36
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:45,171
l really didn't, uh, l didn't read
anything up on it. l didn't want to.

37
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:47,212
l wanted to go in there with an open mind.

38
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,148
The Colonel told me initially
they take fire every single day.

39
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:53,947
l was like, God, how the hell do you take
fire every single day from somebody?

40
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,749
You got to go out there and go kill
the damn enemy.

41
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,220
Quit being, you know, scared.

42
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,121
Go out there and get 'em.

43
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:01,921
And the Colonel and l
came up with, you know,

44
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,622
what we thought was going to be
our campaign plan and that, uh,

45
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:09,134
after two months of being there l would fix
it and that we wouldn't get shot at anymore.

46
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:16,958
The very first day, l remember coming in,

47
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:19,266
and one of the pilots and stuff,
and they said, hey,

48
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:22,171
if you look over there to your left,
uh, that's Pakistan.

49
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:25,642
You know, and we're like, you know,
we all, okay, that's Pakistan.

50
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:30,045
And then they're all mountains,
you know, high elevation.

51
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:33,984
And as you go in elevation,
it starts to get a little bit colder.

52
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,315
And then we go up into the Korengal Valley.

53
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:48,996
l remember looking out the little bubble
windows on the side, kind of just like this,

54
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:51,161
because l was right next to the window.

55
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:56,903
And l could see when the Chinook
had made a hard right turn into the valley.

56
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:59,638
l was like, holy shit.

57
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:01,373
We're not ready for this.

58
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:05,474
We flew around for about half- hour,
45 minutes above the KOP,

59
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:08,213
and you're just looking down there,

60
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:11,552
and you're like,
this is in the middle of nowhere right now.

61
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:13,751
You're away from everything.

62
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:20,459
Honestly, when l first got to the Korengal,
l was like, this is a shit hole.

63
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,263
My mindset was like, oh snap,
l'm going to die here.

64
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:30,706
l remember getting off the bird
and walking up the hill to the hooch.

65
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:34,212
Hey, Jones, you guys standing up
right there, you're wrong.

66
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,542
Come on, guys, better get moving.

67
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:40,846
And just sucking...

68
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,286
and thinking what are we doing?

69
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:52,195
lt started getting dark,
and monkeys were howling,

70
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,289
And l thought they were Taliban.

71
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:58,632
And l thought, holy shit they're close.

72
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:00,569
Everybody's like,
oh, you're going to the Korengal?

73
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,504
And they feel sorry for you
and everything like that.

74
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,600
l'm like, dude,
it can't be that bad, you know?

75
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:07,669
l show up there
and you're burning your own feces.

76
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:10,477
You know, you're living in a tent.

77
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:15,043
l literally lived in a bunker, you know,
about that high, l couldn't even stand up in.

78
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:18,056
See bullet holes all rattled into the Hescos
and when you look up, it's like,

79
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:20,058
l don't even know why l have Hescos here

80
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:23,892
because they're not going to stop the bullets
that are coming down from the mountains.

81
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:29,765
So l felt like l was--
l was like fish in a barrel.

82
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,981
They're gathering intel right now,
basically, on how to deal with us,

83
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:48,577
because they haven't--
there's no really research or intel

84
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:51,214
on how to treat us right now,

85
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,523
because they haven't had to deal with people
like us since World War ll and Vietnam,

86
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:59,462
you know, dealing with guys that are
coming back from 15-month deployments

87
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,660
with as much fighting,
you know, as we went through.

88
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:28,284
Hey, go on that ridgeline, fucking now!

89
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:50,047
Hey, roger, l'm up here by OP four.

90
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:53,346
We're scanning and if we have to,
we'll move into contact.

91
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,683
l got myself, Riegel, and Thomas over here.

92
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:58,154
Roger, over.

93
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,692
Hey, l'm about to find this bastard,
and l'm going to kill him, over.

94
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,489
Okay, roger.
So it's coming from 1 705 and 00.

95
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:08,090
We should be firing on those here
right now, break.

96
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,759
Hang it!

97
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,133
Fire! Firing!

98
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:36,055
The Korengal Outpost is at the 6-3 gridline,
and then the 6-2 gridline--

99
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:41,122
the insurgency has, like, drawn
this imaginary line in the sand there,

100
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,134
and every time the guys
come out of Firebase Phoenix

101
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:45,136
and they cross the 6-2 gridline,

102
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:49,470
l mean, like, no shit, every time they cross
the 6-2 gridline, they get in contact.

103
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:54,604
So l want to extend the security bubble,
because wherever l can place troops

104
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,614
and wherever l can provide security

105
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,480
is where l'm going to be able to
have an influence on the populace.

106
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,215
The hard part is, is that they're so deeply
rooted down here because of family ties

107
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,728
and because of religious ideals, that getting
these people to push out the insurgency

108
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:13,253
and basically push out their family members
is going to be the hard part.

109
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:17,701
Right now the road ends
at the Korengal Outpost,

110
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,103
and where the road ends
is where the Taliban begins.

111
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,076
We've been getting reports that they've been
watching us throughout the day,

112
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:35,314
so the contact right now
l'd say is likely or imminent.

113
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:48,729
- Good to see you.
- Move southeast. lt's this way.

114
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,065
Do you want chai?

115
00:10:51,136 --> 00:10:53,070
We don't have time to sit down
and have chai tonight.

116
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,402
l just wanted to come in and talk to you
briefly about the project.

117
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:58,739
How many people are you actually
going to use to build the project?

118
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:02,171
What's up?

119
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,181
You see that last house, to the right of it?

120
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:07,377
Brownish fucking bush
about fucking 15, 20 meters to the right?

121
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:08,511
Yeah?

122
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:11,488
Someone turned around that corner,
saw us and went right back around, dude.

123
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:26,866
We're going to be moving in darkness.
You're going to be lead, so...

124
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:28,873
We could move now if you need to.

125
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,682
Okay, spread out.

126
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:06,938
l'm pushing up here.

127
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,674
Whoa, a tracer came right by here!

128
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,079
Hey!

129
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,283
There's fire coming. They're shooting.

130
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,087
Over there!

131
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,424
Where? Over where?
Tell me, sir, tell me.

132
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:25,429
Kim!

133
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:36,036
The first friend l lost was Vimoto,

134
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:39,134
and that was right at the beginning
of the deployment. That hit hard.

135
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:43,978
And then a month after that, l lost Restrepo.

136
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:47,485
The day that Restrepo got killed,

137
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:50,386
it came across the net
that we had troops in contact.

138
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:53,425
Then they called back in
and said that we have a casualty.

139
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,222
l need you to give me fire, Cortez.

140
00:12:56,295 --> 00:13:02,029
We didn't know who it was, because nobody
was saying anything over the radio.

141
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,261
When you hear someone's hit,

142
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,462
your first reaction
is just like, fuck, like, no.

143
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:10,406
And then you start going through your head
all the people that you know out there

144
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:13,809
and wanting to eliminate your friends
and the people that were closest to you--

145
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,542
you know, not this guy.
Not this guy. Not this guy.

146
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:21,552
You know, your heart just sank.

147
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,485
You were like, fuck.

148
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:26,217
l mean, it was Doc Restrepo.

149
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:31,695
He was shot in the neck twice...

150
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:37,928
but he was stable,
so that was a relief for us.

151
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,403
We say, okay, he's going to be okay,
because we looked at him.

152
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:43,339
when he gets on the aircraft,
he's still breathing.

153
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:47,708
But he, it hit his, um, artery in his neck,

154
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,713
and he bled out.

155
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:54,514
He bled out on the helicopter ride
to the emergency room

156
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:57,316
where they take you when you get shot.

157
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:03,888
- This is the big danger area right now.
- Okay.

158
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:07,420
Because if we're here
and they start opening up on us...

159
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:08,431
You're in between.

160
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,494
But if we clear down, you guys could
use my weapons squad as an indicator

161
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:15,904
for where they are,
and that's your right limit of fire, man.

162
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,033
Shoot anything up the mountain.

163
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,809
l would say since we haven't been down here
and we don't know what's in here,

164
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:25,873
l'm going to fucking assume the worst,
because it's near Kalaygal,

165
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:28,511
and that they have fortified fighting
positions throughout here.

166
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:30,521
Okay.

167
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:34,252
What were we doing in the Korengal?

168
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:37,090
Our purpose in the Korengal--
they had a road,

169
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:42,293
and the intent was this road to go through
the Korengal and go out to Chowkay Valley

170
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:45,598
to be able to connect the locals

171
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:49,368
where they can have an easy route
up towards the Pech River Valley.

172
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:54,708
And our job there was to try
to sustain the security for the personnel,

173
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,146
to allow them to build that road.

174
00:14:57,216 --> 00:15:00,515
You know, five, ten years from now,

175
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:04,249
the Korengal Valley is going to have
a road going through it that's paved.

176
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:06,587
And we can make more money,
make you guys richer,

177
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,752
make you guys more powerful.
What l need though,

178
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:14,128
is l need you to join with the government,
you know, provide us with that security

179
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:16,861
or help us provide you guys
with that security.

180
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:20,029
And l'll flood this whole place
with money and with projects

181
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:22,335
and with healthcare and with everything.

182
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:41,125
Remember last week when we said that
everything that happened in the past

183
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:43,991
when Captain McKnight was here--
we're kind of, like, wiping the slate clean.

184
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,292
Captain Kearney's got a new slate.

185
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,130
Let's put it behind, and let's get on
with what we've got to do now.

186
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:06,648
Growing up in Oregon, l wasn't allowed
to have sugar 'til l was, like, 13,

187
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:10,916
because my mom was a fucking hippie.

188
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:15,483
And she's always have us doing, like,
little hippie children things, l guess--

189
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:23,023
making, like, homemade paper or painting
something or going, like, on nature walks.

190
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,934
lt was a nice childhood.
l just wasn't allowed to have toy guns

191
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:28,939
or anything like that,
like boys should have, l guess--

192
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:34,104
little toy guns or, like, violent video games
or watch any violent movies at all.

193
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:39,173
Like l had a toy squirt gun that was
a turtle, and my parents took it away

194
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,185
because it said ''squirt gun''--
it had ''gun'' on there.

195
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:43,187
Fire!

196
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,341
Right now priority...

197
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:16,651
For the first few months of the deployment...

198
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:19,589
we'd get rocked hard. They'd hit us from...

199
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:24,391
They'd ambush us at 360 degrees.

200
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:26,397
l remember thinking, you know, holy shit,

201
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:29,798
did everybody from the entire country
come to this valley?

202
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:33,702
ls nobody else fighting anymore?
ls every bad guy in my face?

203
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:37,367
Oh, shit!

204
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:38,875
Motherfuckers.

205
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:41,139
ln the entire country of Afghanistan,

206
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:46,310
we dropped something close
to 70 percent of all the ordinance.

207
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:50,719
All the bombs that were dropped
at that particular time

208
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:52,723
were dropped in the Korengal Valley.

209
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,225
As CNN dubbed it one day
when Bush saw it

210
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:57,625
and said, you know,
the ugliest place on Earth--

211
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,630
the Korengal Valley.

212
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:05,000
But to my family,
l never really told them much

213
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:07,799
until about halfway into the deployment.

214
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,175
l didn't tell them when Vimoto died.

215
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:14,076
l didn't tell them
when Sergeant Padilla lost his arm.

216
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:18,845
l didn't tell them when Pisec got shot.
l didn't tell them when Restrepo got killed.

217
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:22,853
And then when Restrepo got killed was
a few days before my mom's birthday also.

218
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:28,450
So l had to... l had to suck it up
when l called my mom on her birthday

219
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:33,658
and act like everything was okay and say
''Hey, Mom, happy birthday,'' you know,

220
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:37,133
like, ''Yeah, l am doing really good out here,
everything's fine.''

221
00:18:56,922 --> 00:19:01,484
The change came when we in OP Restrepo.

222
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,018
ln the middle of the night we put up
a firebase on top of the place

223
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:11,660
that they had used as their enemy kinetic,
you know, point of attack,

224
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:16,332
or of origin of their attack,
for the last 15 months.

225
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:23,073
We walked up the Spur
with shovels and picks.

226
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:27,551
We worked all though the night just
to make a small semicircle to chill in.

227
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:31,111
We slept for maybe a couple hours each,
started doing it again.

228
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:35,523
That day we got in five, seven firefights.

229
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:37,221
Everybody good?

230
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,787
- Yeah, we're gonna--
- Yeah!

231
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,800
We'd dig. They'd shoot at us.

232
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,462
They'd see us digging,
building this new place. They'd shoot.

233
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:49,029
We'd shoot back. Once it lulled down,
we started digging again.

234
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:52,702
When the boys built that base,

235
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:57,237
the Taliban, or the AAF forces in the valley,
they were completely in shock.

236
00:19:57,315 --> 00:20:00,250
lt was like a middle finger sticking out.

237
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:06,689
And they realized once they could not knock
off OP Restrepo, we had the upper hand.

238
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,192
They started becoming afraid.

239
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,286
Eat some, turban head!

240
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:14,196
Hey, hit the bottom right.
Hit the bottom right of the village.

241
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,928
- Get this!
- Bottom right. Go right more.

242
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,834
Hey, Solo, that's you.
l'm not shooting over everybody.

243
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:31,246
- Let's go, let's go!
- He's down in the draw!

244
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,250
- He's down in the draw.
- Down in the draw.

245
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:35,252
How close?

246
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,698
Buno, get your coms up.

247
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,743
Make sure you got fucking SAW
and a .203 with you.

248
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:07,012
- You're taking Wilson, Cortez.
- Cortez.

249
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:09,019
Don't worry, l'll...

250
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,887
Don't worry. There's very few
that l just straight up hope don't make it.

251
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:29,529
A month or two into it, it was still
a shitty place. We were covered in dirt,

252
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:35,478
digging all the time, getting in firefights,
like four or five firefights a day.

253
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:42,043
And so we--the majority of us really didn't
feel like it should be called OP Restrepo.

254
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,214
it was just a shitty place. lt was just...

255
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,250
lt just didn't resemble
the type of person that he was.

256
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,254
Scuffing up my notes.

257
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:30,128
Feels like longer than forever, yeah

258
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:34,262
My home is now a distant land

259
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:38,002
lf l had one wish, l wish l could be

260
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:42,035
Back on that rock
in the middle of the sea

261
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:45,844
My heart is calling me to the islands

262
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:50,149
Blue skies and tropical breeze

263
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:54,248
l want to go back home

264
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:57,988
Swim in the Pacific sea

265
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,054
You can take the boy from the island

266
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,864
But not the island from the boy

267
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,562
The island stays in your heart

268
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:17,504
l'll never forget where l'm from

269
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:18,981
Oh, no, l'll never forget

270
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:24,955
Where l'm from

271
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,550
Sir. How you doing, sir?
Good to see you again.

272
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:04,652
Good seeing you again.

273
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:07,357
Welcome to the KOP.
l'd like to take you up over there, sir,

274
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:10,060
maybe just try to give you
the once over the world here.

275
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:13,366
This is the southern Korengal.

276
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:16,100
This is, uh, l guess you could call it,
this is the war zone.

277
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:18,108
This is where it's all happening.

278
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:22,010
This is where the majority of the population
of the Korengal lives

279
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,776
and probably about 90% of the fighting.

280
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:28,808
lf you look just to the south here
to that third spur that you see down there,

281
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:33,153
which is called Honcho Hill, that is like
the enemy--l guess you could say--

282
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:35,158
limit of advance for us.

283
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:37,421
Like, we can't go
any further south than that.

284
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:38,894
- What do you call it--Honcho?
- Honcho Hill.

285
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,633
- Honcho Hill.
- You follow that spur,

286
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,600
and you go all the way up here,
Sergeant Major,

287
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:47,297
- and you might be able to see that--
- The tip of the...

288
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,966
that top of the OP.
You can see all the bee huts and stuff.

289
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,906
That's OP Restrepo.

290
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:56,003
Everything south of that
is the enemy sanctuary.

291
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,949
Battle 6, Battle 2-5 ,
l have around 15 up near Restrepo.

292
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,887
Nothing out of the ordinary as far
as movement in the southwest today.

293
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:09,859
Nothing but women and children
out tending to the fields and crops.

294
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:15,491
Enemy assessment--we've got the AAF
are in the final stages to start their attack

295
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:18,559
and moving and getting everything in place.

296
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:22,936
Last 24, conduct a movement
to contact into Loy Kalay,

297
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:28,070
separate the AAF from the populace
in order to spread new lO themes.

298
00:25:44,362 --> 00:25:47,525
Hey, Cunningham, on a side note,
how's the fam?

299
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:52,903
How's the what?

300
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:55,132
- The fam.
- The family?

301
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,730
Billy.

302
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:59,072
Good. They're pretty good.

303
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:05,239
Were they happy to see your crazy self?

304
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:08,479
Yeah, yeah, it was a good time, man.

305
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:11,147
Got to hang out at the ranch
and everything like that, you know?

306
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:13,850
Got to see pretty much everyone
in the family almost.

307
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:19,856
Your family owns a ranch?

308
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:22,729
Of course.

309
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,032
Like cows and pigs and chickens
and horses ranch?

310
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:28,663
No.

311
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,300
Like what kind of ranch, then?

312
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:41,980
lt's like a ranch
just with like land, you know,

313
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:44,681
with gates and stuff and trucks and whatnot.

314
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:48,021
Some guns, some wildlife,
you know, that you shoot at.

315
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:53,687
Okay, so it's just a whole bunch of land
that they kill stuff on.

316
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,991
Yeah. lt's kind of like this.

317
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:02,301
Yeah, but we're not hunting animals,
we're hunting people.

318
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,470
Hearts and minds.

319
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:13,950
Fucking feed tray.

320
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:17,010
Yeah. We'll take their hearts,
and we'll take their minds.

321
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:27,489
All right, listen up. Today we're going
to conduct a movement to contact.

322
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:31,001
The purpose is to talk to the locals
about some lO themes,

323
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:33,003
as far as the road construction team
coming in.

324
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:35,505
Get some workers from their village
to take part in that.

325
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:39,168
Talk about the cow incident.

326
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,677
- Also...
- lt was delicious.

327
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:45,773
Talk about anything out of the ordinary
as far as AAF moving in through their area.

328
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,977
See if they can give us
any information on that.

329
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:50,577
Anyone have any questions?

330
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:58,495
Guys, it's gonna suck, but l'm going
to work you guys into the ground.

331
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:01,396
l need you guys to go out there
and do a patrol in the village

332
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,661
because l need you to keep
the enemy off his toes.

333
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:06,135
l need you to go out there
and push the enemy back

334
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:07,967
so we can buy some white space,

335
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,007
so you guys can go back up there
and work your asses off

336
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:13,043
filling up these sandbags
so that you guys, when do get hit,

337
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:15,636
you get hit but you got
something to hide behind.

338
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:20,241
And the best defense is
who has the greater offense.

339
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:26,046
3-3-4.

340
00:28:26,124 --> 00:28:29,525
6-1-4-9.

341
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:33,257
Elevation 1-5-7-9.

342
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:36,926
And we are set in Koringal.

343
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,628
What's your father do?

344
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:50,771
A shepherd? What do you do?
Are you a shepherd, too?

345
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,335
Let me see your hands.
Your hands.

346
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,608
He's got pretty clean hands
for being a goat herder.

347
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,150
Where'd you get that watch, man?

348
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:10,626
You guys got a lot of goats?

349
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:13,493
60 goats.

350
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,998
60 goats?
That's pretty wealthy, right, Abdul?

351
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,625
Yeah.

352
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:20,762
Well, what do you know about
the people in Kalaygal?

353
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:32,606
He says...

354
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,591
Roger, we haven't found
anybody else to talk to.

355
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,787
We're going to start pushing back now.

356
00:30:44,862 --> 00:30:48,628
Hey, 2-2, this is Bravo 1 .
Start pushing out towards the trail.

357
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:03,136
Oh, fuck.

358
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,994
What have they got?

359
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,231
Oh, l guess a guy running.

360
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:30,240
- A guy running?
- Yeah.

361
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:31,775
Hey, Liz!

362
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:36,335
Lookit. See?

363
00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:38,814
We've seen a guy run from that house
once or twice before.

364
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:40,817
l just don't like the way it is.

365
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:43,547
l don't like how it feels right now.

366
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:46,351
You want him watching towards
the village or down in the draw?

367
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:49,860
- Towards the back side of the house.
- Watch the back side of the house.

368
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:59,559
Hey!

369
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:03,730
Sit down.

370
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:06,709
Sit down.

371
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:25,759
They found a BDU top.
l've got eyes on it right now, over.

372
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:34,862
Hey, keep on searching
this whole house. Search.

373
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:38,397
Yeah, yeah, like this, good. Okay.

374
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:42,207
Who does this belong to?

375
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,612
Never mind.

376
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:46,809
Hey...

377
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:01,229
''lf l go with you,
l'm not going to go with you right now.

378
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,791
- l will come back to the KOP.''
- No, no, he's going--he's coming with us.

379
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:07,030
This guy, he was already at the house.

380
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:11,131
This guy came up later, saw us,
and starting taking off running.

381
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:15,201
l got him, and ever since he started doing
what he's doing now.

382
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:22,214
Hey, tell these guys l'm gonna sit them
in my truck, they need to sit on their hands.

383
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:29,592
Right now what we're tracking
came in the valley on April the 1 1th.

384
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,530
There's fifteen 107-milimeter rockets,
several cases of PKM and AK ammo.

385
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,067
The fear is always there,

386
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:41,366
especially at night when you can't
see what's coming at you.

387
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:48,411
When we started there, we only had
maybe fourteen guys up there.

388
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,242
l mean, it doesn't take much.

389
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:54,512
A few automatic weapons will keep,
you know, a squad pinned down,

390
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:58,715
while they could easily come up
from a side and flank you

391
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:02,020
and, you know, go basically clear house.

392
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:04,458
Nobody's going to help you.
You're in no man's land.

393
00:34:04,495 --> 00:34:08,955
The KOP is only seven hundred,
eight hundred meters away,

394
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:12,662
but that might as well be
in a different country

395
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:14,398
because they're not getting to you.

396
00:34:15,406 --> 00:34:16,668
Not in time.

397
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:39,624
KOP's taking indirect right now.

398
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,563
KOP's taking indirect.

399
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:56,709
Can't see shit what they're doing.

400
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:59,045
Day sight. lt's something.

401
00:34:59,116 --> 00:35:00,378
Better than anything else we got.

402
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:03,351
l need more fucking 240 here!

403
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:05,685
One's by Karingal, the other's by Dallas.

404
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:13,762
Right up there.

405
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,335
The birds we love.

406
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:29,713
Okay, roger, he's pretty much worked
the Honcho Hill ridge.

407
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,945
Want to push him southeast up to 3-0,
just southeast of that.

408
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:43,586
Big firefight, great.

409
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:47,495
Fucking packing up rounds.
That was fun, though, man, that was fun.

410
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:50,466
You can't get a better high.

411
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:52,092
lt's like crack, you know?

412
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:54,967
You can sky dive or bungee jump
or do, you know, kayak,

413
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,031
but once you've been shot at,
you really can't come down.

414
00:35:58,108 --> 00:35:59,632
There's nothing, you can't top that.

415
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,507
How are you going to go back
to the civilian world then?

416
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:03,273
l have no idea.

417
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:06,882
Hey, did you hear me go cyclic?

418
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,010
- l had the barrel smoked!
- Did you hear me?

419
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:11,816
Yeah, what the fuck was that first
batch about, cuz?

420
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:13,413
You was crazy as shit with that.

421
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:17,427
Hey, soon as l popped my head up,
holy-- Guess who.

422
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,690
And you just slid down the stairs.

423
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,129
- Common game planning. l was like...
- Get down!

424
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:44,180
The flight path over...

425
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,829
He's an excellent cook,

426
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:57,061
by far the best cook in the Korengal,
definitely.

427
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,761
Came up to Restrepo one time,

428
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:03,273
cooked us fresh cow,
same-day cow.

429
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:04,363
That was a good day.

430
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:15,483
Jonesie, you want another grill, man?
You all right?

431
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:17,919
No, l don't like to fuck on a full stomach.

432
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:23,990
Dude, we're on TV.

433
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:28,498
Come in here for the real thing.

434
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,932
Don't fight it, don't fight it.

435
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:50,378
Why don't they mess
with you anymore, man?

436
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:54,049
l was one of the first ones
that got messed with to begin with.

437
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:56,251
Well, look at him, look how sexy he is.
l mean, look at this guy.

438
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:58,727
He's a beautiful man.
l'd fuck him back in the States.

439
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:29,891
Let's talk about the road
between Omar and Kandalay.

440
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,129
What guy?

441
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:42,266
Who did we detain?

442
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:45,206
He says that you detain a guy.

443
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:47,937
Haji Se, Haji Se.

444
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:51,175
Naiim was dropped off

445
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:55,241
by another local in Kalaygal

446
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:57,048
who told us that he was bad

447
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,682
and that he was working with Sadikula

448
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:02,851
in the--

449
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,692
what the fuck is Sadikula
in charge of, Rudy, the Mujahadeen?

450
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:08,322
Yeah, he's working with the Muj.

451
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:10,765
And, he was working
with the Mujahadeen.

452
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:13,894
l told you guys from the very get go

453
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:16,906
that if somebody says that they're bad,
l have to investigate it.

454
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:20,171
So now NDS is talking to him.
He's not in jail.

455
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:22,337
He's not being treated bad,

456
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:24,973
he's being talked to
and asked questions.

457
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:28,212
l think we've been pretty upfront
about how we handle people

458
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,116
that we talk to and question.

459
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,711
We've been pretty fair.

460
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:34,622
l'm not like Jim McKnight
where l take all these guys

461
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:37,456
and stick them in Bagram
and they never come back.

462
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:47,100
He says were happy you're here,
you're doing very well,

463
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:49,264
but he's saying that you detained
Mohammed Youssef before,

464
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:52,570
now Mohammed Youssef
didn't come back.

465
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,668
Rudy, who the fuck
is Mohammed Youssef?

466
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:57,873
Mohammed Kalam's son,
the guy that cut the worker's heads off.

467
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:01,145
That's because l saw the video
where he cut their heads off.

468
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:07,114
l saw him do it.

469
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,719
l saw him with my own two eyes.

470
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:19,869
You're not understanding
that l don't fucking care.

471
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:24,732
And the thing that's sad to me is that as
much as Captain Kearney go down there

472
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:26,833
and conduct different Shuras

473
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,402
and tell them about the positives
about what we can do to help them,

474
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:32,210
it seemed like it didn't go anywhere.

475
00:40:32,282 --> 00:40:34,842
You know?
lt seemed like everything that he-

476
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:36,112
We took one step fofward

477
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,051
and it seemed like
they took two steps backwards.

478
00:40:57,407 --> 00:41:00,376
We've got three village elders
just come down and they want to talk.

479
00:41:00,444 --> 00:41:03,470
Not sure what they want
to talk about yet.

480
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:04,946
lt's a good sign.

481
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:07,210
lt's the first time it's happened
up here at OP Restrepo.

482
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:08,410
We've had people come in--

483
00:41:08,485 --> 00:41:11,818
elders come in and say before
that they wanted to provide some information,

484
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,187
but never shown up to us,
you know, come back and talk to us.

485
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:17,193
So this is a positive sign.

486
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:19,286
Do you hear about the cow that--

487
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:22,059
- The cow?
- Yeah, the US soldiers kill it.

488
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:23,690
- They killed--
- Yeah.

489
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,826
So they came because of that.

490
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:29,566
They want to get information
about the cow that--

491
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,073
He is the owner of cow.

492
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:34,372
All right, the cow?
The reason why we killed it

493
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:37,106
because it ran into our constantine wire

494
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:41,208
and it was mangled
inside the constantine wire,

495
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:43,753
so we had to kill it
to put it out of its misery

496
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:46,949
because if we would have got it out,
it would have been useless.

497
00:41:47,024 --> 00:41:50,391
- That's why we killed it.
- They are asking because it was illegal.

498
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,451
- lllegal?
- Yeah, illegal.

499
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:54,588
- To kill it?
- Yeah.

500
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:00,566
- What do you want to do?
- Just tell them.

501
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:02,605
What do they want us
to do about the cow?

502
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:15,083
Do they want to be
reimbursed somehow or--

503
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:19,316
He says that it is up to you,
if you want to pay money for that or--

504
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:22,290
How much does a cow cost?

505
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:24,452
lt's going to be like four
or five hundred dollars,

506
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:28,464
which is going to be twenty,
twenty five thousand Afghani, over.

507
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,068
Did we kill this cow?

508
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:37,197
Well, it was tangled up in a wire,
pretty much dead.

509
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:40,209
324 ended up cutting it up. Over.

510
00:42:48,418 --> 00:42:51,410
We're not going to be able
to give him money in exchange for his cow.

511
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:56,016
But what we can give him
is the rice, the beans, the sugar.

512
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:04,500
Now, the HA that they will receive

513
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:07,696
is going to be, you know,
the weight of the cow.

514
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:09,671
Whatever the weight of the cow was

515
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,473
will be the weight of return of HA
as far as rice, beans, sugar.

516
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,325
- ls that good?
- They want money.

517
00:43:29,393 --> 00:43:33,454
We're not going to be able
to give them the money.

518
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,363
lf that's all he came for,
he's not going to get it.

519
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:46,670
626 perstat, l have 20 at Restrepo,

520
00:43:46,743 --> 00:43:49,177

521
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:50,474

522
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:52,174
6 ANA and one terp

523
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:54,410
at Restrepo, break.

524
00:43:54,484 --> 00:43:57,248
Talk louder, nobody
can hear you down here, over.

525
00:43:58,322 --> 00:44:00,688
626 perstat,

526
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,520
l have 20 at Restrepo,

527
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,992
15 at the KOP,

528
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:05,426
4 at OP1 ,

529
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:06,393
4 on leave,

530
00:44:06,463 --> 00:44:07,760
1 photo journalist,

531
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:08,923
6 ANA, and 1 terp--

532
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:10,489
l didn't know they had algebra two.

533
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:18,238
Yeah! Burning the poop!

534
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:20,606
Got the black man
on the burning the poop detail.

535
00:44:20,677 --> 00:44:24,340
Hey, man, just watch yourself, God damn it.

536
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:28,612
Second platoon killed that cow
and now l gotta pay for it.

537
00:44:28,685 --> 00:44:31,153
l still wanna see Spanky
and Vaughn go at it.

538
00:44:31,221 --> 00:44:35,555
- Vaughn would fucking destroy Spanky.
- Let's go get him.

539
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:36,785
Vaughn!

540
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:41,862
Vaughn, you're going
to beat Spanky's ass!

541
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,763
He's coming up here,
you better not lose.

542
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:45,461
Dude, if you lose, so help me God.

543
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:47,901
lt's going to reflect poorly
on me if you lose.

544
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,166
You better not let
that cherry bitch beat you.

545
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:54,242
Make him tough.
Get him, get him.

546
00:44:54,311 --> 00:44:56,245
- Vaughn.
- What's up, dude?

547
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:03,252
- Come on, fight back!
- You're such a little bitch.

548
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:09,252
All right, go ahead.

549
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:11,692
- Stretch them out.
- What the fuck, Spanky?

550
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:14,322
You gonna let him
fucking manhandle you?

551
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:17,196
- Let him get tired.
- Flip over, man.

552
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:20,968
Yeah, there you go!

553
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:25,668
Nice, there you go.

554
00:45:25,742 --> 00:45:27,004
You suck!

555
00:45:29,046 --> 00:45:31,981
Battle of the cherries.

556
00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:33,380
We're not talking about cherry
in the army either,

557
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,678
we're talking about cherry at life.

558
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:37,151
Vaughn here is very cherry at life.

559
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,814
But we're making him into a man.

560
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,983
That's all that's important here.

561
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:48,124
...we talked about the road being built.

562
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:50,689
Continued to hear from the elders

563
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:53,793
that they don't want
to give up any workers,

564
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,862
despite what it is that you
all have been telling me.

565
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,843
So if you guys get these local--
that are willing to do that

566
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:04,278
to come and start getting
them jobs immediately,

567
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:06,815
to bypass all the elder--

568
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:09,716
l don't think--
l think they're just--

569
00:46:09,786 --> 00:46:13,187
lf we really fucked them up
like they said,

570
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,918
then they are just chilling,
trying to recuperate.

571
00:46:15,992 --> 00:46:18,119
lt's just like what we would be doing.

572
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:21,323
You know, seven--
eight dudes wounded,

573
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:24,162
l mean seven dudes wounded,
one dude dead,

574
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:27,362
we wouldn't be going out strong.

575
00:46:27,437 --> 00:46:30,497
We'd be resting at Blessing right now.

576
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:32,201
You know what l mean?

577
00:46:32,275 --> 00:46:36,905
That's what l think
they're doing-- resting.

578
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,709
Are you wondering why it is so quiet?

579
00:46:38,782 --> 00:46:40,909
Yeah, it's got me baffled right now.

580
00:46:40,984 --> 00:46:42,451
Baffled or worried?

581
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:44,885
Just confused.
l am at a loss for words right now.

582
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:46,718
He's worried.

583
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,348
He's worried. He's scared.

584
00:46:53,463 --> 00:46:55,090
Most scared.

585
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:56,564
Or worried. Whatever.

586
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:58,191
Yeah.

587
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,463
l'd have to say Rock Avalanche.

588
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,902
lf l had to pick a moment,

589
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:04,236
l'd probably say Rock Avalanche.

590
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:09,142
Operation Rock Avalanche
was the low point for me personally.

591
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:11,009
l saw a lot of professional
tough guys

592
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,912
get weak in the knees.

593
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:18,082
l'll go ahead and orient you guys
to the different LZs that are out there.

594
00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:21,556
Up on Divpat where the C2 element
will be located is LZ Cubs.

595
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:24,093
The Taliban
or the AAF forces in the valley,

596
00:47:24,161 --> 00:47:26,789
they got very, very audacious

597
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:30,663
and tenacious during Rock Avalanche.

598
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:34,465
Physically putting their hands on soldiers,

599
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:37,564
able to get so close to us
that they can kill my soldiers,

600
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:40,075
steal the equipment,
and still get away.

601
00:47:40,143 --> 00:47:43,169
l mean...

602
00:47:43,246 --> 00:47:45,009
that's ballsy.

603
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:49,142
We'll be releasing with Wildcat One,

604
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:50,618
somewhere between Busch and Coors.

605
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:52,484
Moving in on Rock Avalanche

606
00:47:52,556 --> 00:47:57,323
with going into areas like Yaka China
or up on the top of the Talisar.

607
00:47:57,394 --> 00:48:00,659
Those are areas
we haven't previously been,

608
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,493
you know, during the deployment.

609
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:05,330
North goes that way
toward Sergeant Rougle,

610
00:48:05,402 --> 00:48:08,030
south is this way towards me
and the First Sergeant.

611
00:48:08,104 --> 00:48:10,971
To go in there not ever having
laid eyes on the area,

612
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:15,478
hearing the stories
about guys who'd gone prior to us

613
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:17,410
getting fucked up down,
you know,

614
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,505
in areas where they
literally shouldn't have been in.

615
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:24,577
We're going to be moving out
of HLZ Cubs into HLZ Polk.

616
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:26,918
ln Rock Avalanche we knew
the expectation that we was going

617
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,252
to get engaged going up there,

618
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,293
but we all knew that.

619
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,796
ln the location where we was actually going
to conducting this operation and stuff,

620
00:48:33,863 --> 00:48:36,331
was where the bad guys,
their safe haven was at.

621
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:38,128
They wasn't coming to you.

622
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,669
Sometimes you had to go out there
and reach out to them.

623
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:52,477
Go into program,
go into your radio configurations,

624
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:55,848
and then where it says
SlNCGARS or basic,

625
00:48:55,919 --> 00:48:58,911
change that to ANDVT.

626
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:02,917
- Coming after you, motherfucker.
- Right here, bitch?

627
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:07,362
Let's do this, motherfucker!
l'm coming back.

628
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,761
l'm coming back, don't worry.

629
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:11,357
Do you get nervous
before something like this?

630
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,903
l get nervous for the guys.
l get nervous for myself.

631
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:19,373
l mean, l just--
l just called my mom and dad

632
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:21,467
and l'll try calling my wife
before l take off,

633
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:24,069
just one last ''l love you''
to all of them.

634
00:49:24,147 --> 00:49:27,708
And, you know, the guys,
that's the hardest thing is like,

635
00:49:27,784 --> 00:49:29,513
you know, if something happens to me,

636
00:49:29,586 --> 00:49:32,111
there's not much l can do
about it or anything like that.

637
00:49:32,188 --> 00:49:35,988
But it takes a little bit out of you

638
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,722
every time you see one of your boys
get hurt or you lose one of them.

639
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:41,661
lt's really like a big family.

640
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,573
We flew in the middle of the night.

641
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:05,110
Guess what, they're not
quiet helicopters that we fly.

642
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:06,519
The enemy's awake now.

643
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:08,853
What the fuck are the Americans
doing flying over us right now?

644
00:50:11,194 --> 00:50:13,185
So now everybody's on
their radio's, l'm sure,

645
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:15,697
you know, ''Hey, the Americans
are heading this way.''

646
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:18,529
So we got on the ground
and we were already being told,

647
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:21,536
be on alert, you know,
everybody knows we're here.

648
00:51:25,735 --> 00:51:29,398
lf we could get one going
from west to east into that draw, over.

649
00:51:34,944 --> 00:51:35,968
lt's real hot.

650
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:39,072
- All right, break.
- Coming out.

651
00:51:39,149 --> 00:51:42,312
l'd like you to come in
for one more re-attack.

652
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:47,687
Come down in elevation in that draw
and fill right there in the center, over.

653
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,124
So you did hit the target.

654
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,492
This house right there.

655
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:17,517
This is the aftermath of what AH-64s do.

656
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:20,147
Good old attack helicopters.

657
00:53:33,963 --> 00:53:37,091
He said that there is
five guys already dead

658
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:42,968
and ten of the females and kids already,
they are injured, you know.

659
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,202
Show me which of them is the Taliban.

660
00:53:46,276 --> 00:53:47,607
There is no Taliban.

661
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:56,375
Damn it.

662
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:58,113
You know?
l need to know better.

663
00:53:58,187 --> 00:53:59,848
l need to figure this stuff out better

664
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:01,618
so that l can do this,

665
00:54:01,724 --> 00:54:03,988
so that l'm not killing these people
and not making them mad.

666
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:06,427
l mean, first impressions
are the lasting impression.

667
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:09,431
That's the first time anybody's been
in Yaka China, and what do l do?

668
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:13,629
l kill a bunch of bad guys,

669
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:16,797
but in the same instance,

670
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:19,398
l'm killing five locals

671
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:22,569
that may not have been
the ones that pulled the trigger,

672
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:25,375
but in some way shape or form,
were connected to them.

673
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:30,808
There you go.

674
00:54:48,972 --> 00:54:50,337
Dishka?

675
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:56,608
Afghan dishka,
not American dishka, right?

676
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,318
This is divorce paper.

677
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:03,977
- What?
- Divorce paper.

678
00:55:04,053 --> 00:55:05,418
- Di-wars?
- Paper, yeah.

679
00:55:05,488 --> 00:55:07,046
- What does that mean?
- Divorce.

680
00:55:07,123 --> 00:55:10,354
Like some woman you getting married
then you're going to get a divorce.

681
00:55:10,426 --> 00:55:11,984
- Divorce papers?
-Yeah.

682
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:13,221
Okay.

683
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:16,225
Who owns the house?

684
00:55:22,038 --> 00:55:23,801
Did you ask him where the pistol was?

685
00:55:26,976 --> 00:55:30,912
Eight RPG heads.
One, two, three, four boosters.

686
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,347
Got four boosters,
three batteries, shotgun.

687
00:55:57,707 --> 00:55:59,402
This is Colonel Ostlund,
he's my boss,

688
00:55:59,475 --> 00:56:01,136
you know, the one l always tell you.

689
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:08,012
We brought the Colonel
down there to talk to them,

690
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:11,679
and we did that because
basically we felt bad

691
00:56:11,754 --> 00:56:14,120
for the fact that we injured
some of their kids

692
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,590
and that we killed
some of the locals.

693
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:20,288
The ACM that comes in
and gives you five dollars

694
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:22,092
to carry this stuff
around the mountains

695
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:24,292
and tells you that
you're doing a jihad

696
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:26,130
and go fight the Americans

697
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:28,033
is doing nothing for you

698
00:56:28,104 --> 00:56:30,436
except making you a slave
for five dollars

699
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:32,303
as he hides on a mountain,

700
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,434
because he won't fight my soldiers.

701
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,273
These foreigners,
they don't fight my soldiers.

702
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:38,313
They hide on a mountain in a cave,

703
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:40,645
under a rock and talk on a radio

704
00:56:40,717 --> 00:56:44,118
and pay your sons
a small amount of money

705
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:46,781
to go ahead
and shoot at my soldiers

706
00:56:46,856 --> 00:56:49,017
and my soldiers
end up killing your sons.

707
00:56:58,267 --> 00:56:59,894
But this is the deal we'll make.

708
00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:01,561
Everybody needs a job,

709
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:04,469
and we're going to try to bring
progress here and some jobs,

710
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:07,567
and Captain Kearney will talk
to the Shura on Friday

711
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:09,577
about some job projects.

712
00:57:15,818 --> 00:57:17,649
The whole time we were there,
we were thinking, ''Okay.

713
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,278
When's it coming?
When's it coming.

714
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:21,289
They're going to hit us.
When's it going to happen?

715
00:57:43,813 --> 00:57:46,839
- This sucks, dude.
- l'm just going to double check it.

716
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:49,350
lCOM chatter right now
coming out of Chappadara,

717
00:57:49,418 --> 00:57:52,012
a guy named Obed's talking
to the elders,

718
00:57:52,088 --> 00:57:57,048
and apparently said that the elders
are in charge of what's going on.

719
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:59,924
The elders basically want
jihad down here in the Korengal,

720
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:02,487
and whatever they want, they'll--
they're here to assist,

721
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:04,759
so we'll see what happens.

722
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:06,632
But it doesn't sound
very good for us, huh?

723
00:58:35,932 --> 00:58:37,365
Hey, Sergeant Patterson,

724
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:39,594
l found four fighting positions
over there, AK-47 s.

725
00:58:39,669 --> 00:58:41,296
l'm going to push to this next hilltop.

726
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,498
l'm also getting lCOM traffic
that there may be enemy close to us.

727
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:52,908
Getting intel saying that they've got eyes
on three to four US personnel

728
00:58:52,982 --> 00:58:54,847
and they're getting close to them.

729
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,788
So they've got eyes on us
and it can be anywhere,

730
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,384
this high ground there,

731
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:07,053
there's some more spurs back there,

732
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:09,791
there's one we crossed
to an open patch back there.

733
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:12,664
They could have easily had eyes on us
when we were moving in.

734
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,935
What the fuck was that?

735
00:59:25,147 --> 00:59:26,375
Did you hear that?

736
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:27,973
lt might be the birds, sir.

737
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,244
Shooting?

738
00:59:33,456 --> 00:59:35,151
Am l just jumpy?

739
00:59:38,027 --> 00:59:41,326
Fucking Christ, monitor this.

740
01:00:00,149 --> 01:00:03,084
Sergeant P...

741
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:05,245
do we got guys in these
pine trees right here?

742
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:07,617
Do we?

743
01:00:25,675 --> 01:00:29,133
When the attack finally happened,

744
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:32,044
l remember it was myself
and my team

745
01:00:32,114 --> 01:00:35,311
on the south eastern corner

746
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:38,182
of basically the area
that we were covering.

747
01:00:38,254 --> 01:00:40,245
We got ambushed, like,

748
01:00:40,323 --> 01:00:44,054
just every single position got hit
at the same time pretty much.

749
01:00:44,126 --> 01:00:47,584
They placed a PKM a machine gun
down into our position

750
01:00:47,663 --> 01:00:49,893
and one orientated
into the scout position,

751
01:00:49,966 --> 01:00:52,230
and just rained down hell.

752
01:00:52,301 --> 01:00:53,893
l just look over to my right

753
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,336
and l see rounds breaking
branches off the tree.

754
01:00:56,405 --> 01:00:59,431
They were shooting RPGs at us,

755
01:00:59,508 --> 01:01:01,237
they were shooting
pretty much everything.

756
01:01:01,344 --> 01:01:03,904
When l got hit,
it actually came

757
01:01:03,946 --> 01:01:06,881
with enough force
that it rolled me fofward.

758
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:10,783
You know, initial thought was,
''What happened?''

759
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:13,447
l felt pain, you know,

760
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:15,820
placed my hand there
just underneath my lBA

761
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:18,155
because that's where l felt,
you know, the initial pain,

762
01:01:18,227 --> 01:01:21,924
pulled my hand out,
saw blood, knew l was hit.

763
01:01:21,998 --> 01:01:24,364
l looked up in time from all fours

764
01:01:24,433 --> 01:01:28,267
to watch a guy come over the crest
probably about 35-45 meters

765
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:31,738
to fire an RPG directly at me.

766
01:01:31,807 --> 01:01:34,674
lnitial thought was, ''Wow,
this is the last thing l'm going to see,''

767
01:01:34,744 --> 01:01:36,678
because the guy was so close.

768
01:01:36,746 --> 01:01:41,080
And, you know,
the round came in, exploded.

769
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,244
Took shrapnel all throughout
my body, but...

770
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,948
kind of did--
after the explosion, like,

771
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:49,491
''l'm still here, l'm still alive,''

772
01:01:49,558 --> 01:01:54,894
and then proceeded to basically roll
down the mountain into the bushes.

773
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:57,330
And they were all up in position,

774
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,425
l could hear them talking to each other.

775
01:01:59,502 --> 01:02:04,064
To our north we heard somebody
yelling for a medic.

776
01:02:04,173 --> 01:02:07,142
l was the first one that heard it.
l yelled back to Sergeant Hoyt,

777
01:02:07,176 --> 01:02:09,804
telling him if l could go
and see who who it was.

778
01:02:09,879 --> 01:02:14,282
Myself along with Cortez
started moving--

779
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,648
we started bounding towards where
we heard the guy yelling from.

780
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:18,016
We didn't know who it was.

781
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:19,714
l got to the wounded and found out
it was Vandenberge.

782
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:22,257
l yelled back it was Vandenberge
that was wounded, bring a medic.

783
01:02:22,324 --> 01:02:23,848
He was just bleeding real bad.

784
01:02:23,926 --> 01:02:27,054
His whole left side of his body
was this real dark red color.

785
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:29,757
And all he kept on saying was,
''Hey, help me, guys. Help me.''

786
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:31,060
just rocking back and forth.

787
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:34,830
Saying ''l'm bleeding out,
you gotta save me. l'm dying.''

788
01:02:34,904 --> 01:02:37,099
Just stuff like that.

789
01:02:37,173 --> 01:02:39,038
Started handing him
gauze, tourniquet.

790
01:02:39,108 --> 01:02:41,576
Just started packing
the wound with gauze.

791
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:43,612
l had my finger
knuckle-deep in his arm.

792
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:45,237
Ended up stopping the bleeding.

793
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:47,441
l'm asking,
''Where are the guys at?

794
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:49,711
Where's the Taliban at?
Where's the enemy at?''

795
01:02:49,785 --> 01:02:53,881
Last time he saw them,
they were 20 feet away.

796
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:58,122
And just was l was
going to give him an lV,

797
01:02:58,194 --> 01:03:00,355
Sergeant Stichter
and Doc Old got there

798
01:03:00,463 --> 01:03:02,192
and carried on from there.

799
01:03:02,231 --> 01:03:05,928
Sergeant Patterson and all them took over,
and l pushed out with Cortez.

800
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:07,468
We didn't bound,
we didn't do anything,

801
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:08,935
we just ran in a straight line

802
01:03:09,004 --> 01:03:12,599
and got to Rice as quick as we can.

803
01:03:12,675 --> 01:03:15,508
At that point l kind of realized,
''Hey, l'm stable.

804
01:03:15,578 --> 01:03:17,478
''You know, l been here
ten, fifteen minutes.

805
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:20,913
l'm still breathing,
l'm not going into shock.''

806
01:03:20,983 --> 01:03:23,008
Kind of evaluating myself.

807
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:25,349
So basically just gave them orders to--

808
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:27,116
''Hey, you need
to maneuver your guys.

809
01:03:27,189 --> 01:03:30,647
And push up
and clear across that hilltop.''

810
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:32,626
As l went up,
l didn't see anyone there.

811
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:34,595
l took a knee and set up security,

812
01:03:34,663 --> 01:03:36,130
and when l turned to my right,

813
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:37,756
l saw Sergeant Rougle just laying there.

814
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,892
l ran up and l saw
Sergeant Rougle's body

815
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:42,437
and it didn't even click.

816
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:44,063
l ran past him.

817
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:48,907
l saw his face, how it was,
kind of messed up.

818
01:03:48,978 --> 01:03:53,005
l wanted to cry, but didn't.

819
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:56,410
l was shocked, honestly.

820
01:03:56,485 --> 01:04:02,253
l was shocked because l saw
Sergeant Rougle just laying there.

821
01:04:02,324 --> 01:04:06,693
lt was-- lt was chaos.

822
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:10,162
And when we finally had a second

823
01:04:10,232 --> 01:04:12,894
to stop and think,

824
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:15,198
that's when l realized that

825
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:18,536
one of my good friends
had gone, you know,

826
01:04:18,607 --> 01:04:21,599
and l started hearing about
Sergeant Rice, Vandenberge.

827
01:04:21,677 --> 01:04:24,544
l didn't even know that they
had been hit at that point.

828
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:25,978
And...

829
01:04:37,426 --> 01:04:38,586
l need a--

830
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:40,322
Yeah, time out. Hold on.

831
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:47,562
l'm just trying to keep
my train of thought.

832
01:05:07,723 --> 01:05:10,214
Have that box ready.
Have the next goddamn box ready.

833
01:05:10,292 --> 01:05:12,385
Hey, l need immediate
suppression on 2251 .

834
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:14,224
They enemy's pushed up
on the high ground--

835
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,192
We're not getting shit.

836
01:05:24,073 --> 01:05:26,371
512255, if we've got A-10s,

837
01:05:26,442 --> 01:05:31,641
l want gun runs from east to west
coming in, okay?

838
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:34,012
The hill's been taken over by the enemy.

839
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,141
That hill right here?

840
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:36,514
Wildcat's hill.

841
01:05:36,585 --> 01:05:39,281
All right, we're going to go around
to the east and go around.

842
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:45,759
Hey, Abdul!
Get the fuck over here!

843
01:05:45,828 --> 01:05:49,525
tell these guys we're pushing up
on this fucking ridge.

844
01:05:49,598 --> 01:05:51,828
Hey, he wants us to go up
over this hill and bum rush it.

845
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,265
There's fucking dudes right there.

846
01:05:53,335 --> 01:05:55,633
lf we do that, we're going to have
to fucking lay down some--

847
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,467
We're going to have
to lay down fire first.

848
01:05:57,539 --> 01:05:59,598
- Yeah, but we--
- We can't get a hold of them.

849
01:05:59,675 --> 01:06:00,903
We don't know where they're at.

850
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:02,910
That's why we have
to lay down fire first.

851
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,821
Look, they took fire
from right over here.

852
01:06:19,895 --> 01:06:21,692
Okay?

853
01:06:21,764 --> 01:06:24,232
Hey, who's down?

854
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,325
We got Sergeant Rougle and them up?

855
01:06:26,402 --> 01:06:28,336
Hey.

856
01:06:28,404 --> 01:06:29,462
What?

857
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:35,301
Where they at?

858
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,513
Just keep down.

859
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:41,276
- Get down.
- What?

860
01:06:42,518 --> 01:06:44,383
- What's going on?
- Just chill out, dude.

861
01:06:44,453 --> 01:06:47,183
- Chill the fuck out out.
- Who's over there?

862
01:06:47,256 --> 01:06:48,553
Oh, my God.

863
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,518
Shut up.

864
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:56,123
Move, man.

865
01:06:56,198 --> 01:06:58,132
ls Sergeant Rice still alive?

866
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,929
- He's alive?
- He's going to make it.

867
01:07:03,972 --> 01:07:06,099
- There's nothing we could do.
- Where's everybody else?

868
01:07:06,175 --> 01:07:09,269
Hey, we've got friendlies here
and friendlies to your six, right there.

869
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:11,040
Vandenberge all right?

870
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:13,946
Vandenberge's already--
He's stable right now.

871
01:07:15,818 --> 01:07:17,183
That ain't Sergeant Rougle.

872
01:07:18,387 --> 01:07:20,150
You're lying, right, man?

873
01:07:20,222 --> 01:07:23,658
Why would l lie about
something like that?

874
01:07:23,726 --> 01:07:25,694
Where'd he get hit?
l got to see.

875
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:27,558
Don't look at him.
ls it bad?

876
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:29,062
Tell me, dude.
Tell me, dude.

877
01:07:29,131 --> 01:07:31,031
lt was quick.
lt was quick.

878
01:07:34,269 --> 01:07:35,668
There was nothing we could do, bro!

879
01:07:44,713 --> 01:07:46,908
Where the bad guys at?

880
01:07:46,982 --> 01:07:48,609
Battle Six Romeo, this is two-six.

881
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:52,552
l've pushed to the site
of the KlA, break.

882
01:07:54,423 --> 01:07:56,118
Right now we have the hilltop.

883
01:07:56,191 --> 01:07:58,421
lt's in the same vicinity as my last grid.

884
01:07:58,494 --> 01:08:00,291
Right now we're going
to move the wounded in action--

885
01:08:00,396 --> 01:08:02,830
there's two of them--
back to LZ Eagles.

886
01:08:02,865 --> 01:08:07,495
When Captain Kearney
told me up by the LZ

887
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:11,198
that Staff Sergeant Rougle was killed,

888
01:08:11,273 --> 01:08:14,538
it was gut wrenching.

889
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,474
You know, there's different
levels to quality of fighters.

890
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:26,181
He was one of the best,
if not the best.

891
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:30,123
And l think that was what was tough
for a lot of people was,

892
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:32,160
you know, kind of knowing that
in the back of their mind,

893
01:08:32,227 --> 01:08:35,321
well, if the best guy we have
out here just got killed,

894
01:08:35,397 --> 01:08:36,762
where's that put me?

895
01:08:36,832 --> 01:08:39,027
What's going to happen to me?

896
01:08:39,101 --> 01:08:42,593
What's going to happen
to the guy to my left, to my right?

897
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:52,478
Hey, we're going down here
to get the wounded first.

898
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:05,385
- Hey, let's go.
- Let's go.

899
01:09:05,461 --> 01:09:06,951
lt was a coordinated attack.

900
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:09,827
They drew all our attention
over to there from here.

901
01:09:09,898 --> 01:09:12,958
These guys over here
also returning fire from there.

902
01:09:13,035 --> 01:09:14,662
They fucking flanked them.

903
01:09:14,736 --> 01:09:18,672
You can see where the path is here
where the fuckers came up.

904
01:09:20,609 --> 01:09:22,975
Okay, where's this fucking compound?
l want it destroyed.

905
01:09:23,045 --> 01:09:25,878
Let's go.

906
01:09:25,948 --> 01:09:28,212
- Stichter, destroy it now.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:09:41,497 --> 01:09:45,058
After we go ahead
and get the KlA out of here,

908
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:49,729
l want gunmetal to search
directly to my west.

909
01:09:49,805 --> 01:09:52,399
Hijar believes that he has a blood trail,

910
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:54,874
l want them to be getting
down low to try and PlD

911
01:09:54,943 --> 01:09:56,410
and see where this guy's stopped.

912
01:09:56,478 --> 01:09:58,742
lt's likely that where
we find this son of a bitch

913
01:09:58,814 --> 01:10:00,543
is where we find everybody else.

914
01:10:02,718 --> 01:10:04,379
Hijar, make sure he understood that.

915
01:10:31,313 --> 01:10:32,712
Watch the pine trees.

916
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:34,942
Just on the north side of that,
you can see a house on the corner.

917
01:10:35,017 --> 01:10:36,678
As it cuts like that?

918
01:10:36,752 --> 01:10:38,083
lt comes almost like an L shape.

919
01:10:38,153 --> 01:10:40,087
- See the terraces right there?
- Got it.

920
01:10:40,155 --> 01:10:43,215
Okay, now, the fucking
far southeast side,

921
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:46,284
there's a fucking-- there's a dude
on the roof down in that house.

922
01:10:47,529 --> 01:10:51,431
- About a thousand meters.
- Roger.

923
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,901
Hey, Raeon's got a guy
to our northwest

924
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:58,906
on top of a building
walking around, over.

925
01:10:58,974 --> 01:11:00,908
- Any other info?
- No.

926
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:02,738
He was looking up this way,

927
01:11:02,778 --> 01:11:04,211
and he just came off the roof,

928
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:05,371
and he went back in his house.

929
01:11:05,447 --> 01:11:06,778
Roger, acknowledge.

930
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:09,840
Raeon, next time you see that dude,
take his head off.

931
01:11:13,755 --> 01:11:15,382
Where's that range finder at?

932
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,755
He was a good dude, man.

933
01:11:19,828 --> 01:11:21,295
Sergeant Rougle?

934
01:11:23,398 --> 01:11:25,059
- You want a real cigarette?
- Yeah.

935
01:11:28,337 --> 01:11:31,329
l'm worried about the rest of the guys.
They've been taking it real bad.

936
01:11:32,674 --> 01:11:34,471
One Alpha's kind of
blaming it on himself

937
01:11:34,543 --> 01:11:36,738
because we couldn't
push over the top,

938
01:11:36,812 --> 01:11:38,905
but the thing he's got to understand
is they fucking--

939
01:11:38,981 --> 01:11:40,608
He was dead instantly.

940
01:11:40,682 --> 01:11:42,309
There's nothing you can do right there.

941
01:12:03,105 --> 01:12:05,164
Actually, l can't even sleep, honestly.

942
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,936
l've been on about four or five
different types of sleeping pills

943
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,238
and none of them help.

944
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:11,279
That's how bad the nightmares are.

945
01:12:11,346 --> 01:12:13,814
l prefer not to sleep
and not dream about it,

946
01:12:13,882 --> 01:12:16,214
than sleep and...

947
01:12:16,284 --> 01:12:18,752
just see the picture in my head is...

948
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,878
pretty bad.

949
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:30,061
That actually stuck with me
for the rest of the deployment.

950
01:12:32,601 --> 01:12:36,537
Stuck with me through
coming back here to ltaly.

951
01:12:38,073 --> 01:12:40,667
l still obviously haven't...

952
01:12:40,742 --> 01:12:43,074
figured out how to deal
with it inside.

953
01:12:48,016 --> 01:12:50,211
The only hope
l have right now is that

954
01:12:50,285 --> 01:12:53,015
eventually l'll be able
to process it differently.

955
01:12:53,088 --> 01:12:55,283
l'm never going to forget it.

956
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:57,689
Never going to even let go of it.

957
01:12:59,027 --> 01:13:02,895
l don't want to not
have that as a memory

958
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:04,693
because that was tone of the moments

959
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:08,294
that makes me appreciate
everything that l have.

960
01:15:05,587 --> 01:15:06,576
Steiner?

961
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,723
Steiner, come on!

962
01:15:19,467 --> 01:15:21,401
Not yet. Not yet.

963
01:16:00,275 --> 01:16:02,072
Still working to try to bring about

964
01:16:02,177 --> 01:16:06,204
the Korengal
to get the road moving here.

965
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:08,375
Are you really drawing
the Korengal Valley?

966
01:16:10,385 --> 01:16:12,353
lt's the only thing
l know how to draw.

967
01:16:17,926 --> 01:16:21,362
l just send it home in letters.

968
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:22,862
Just draw.

969
01:16:46,755 --> 01:16:48,518
So do you have a songbook or something,

970
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:51,821
or an exercise book to practice with?

971
01:16:51,893 --> 01:16:53,053
You just fuck around?

972
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:54,288
Yeah l'm just fucking around.

973
01:16:54,362 --> 01:16:57,695
You need one of those books,
with the charts on them.

974
01:16:57,766 --> 01:16:59,563
Yeah, l need-- that would be nice.

975
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:01,795
Restrepo was teaching me that stuff,

976
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:05,896
but he-- he taught me like a few,

977
01:17:05,941 --> 01:17:08,375
but l wrote just one, a C chord,

978
01:17:08,443 --> 01:17:11,970
but, you know, l don't know.

979
01:17:12,047 --> 01:17:14,675
l still have his--

980
01:17:14,749 --> 01:17:17,513
l actually still have
one of his Flamenco books

981
01:17:17,585 --> 01:17:18,984
or whatever it is.

982
01:17:19,054 --> 01:17:21,045
How to play guitar flamenco,
you know.

983
01:17:21,122 --> 01:17:24,387
He was amazing on guitar.

984
01:17:24,459 --> 01:17:27,019
- lt was just beautiful music.
- lt was amazing.

985
01:17:27,095 --> 01:17:29,029
He used to grow
his fingernails out real long,

986
01:17:29,097 --> 01:17:31,031
and put like nail hardener.

987
01:17:31,099 --> 01:17:33,397
So we always used
to get on him about that.

988
01:17:33,468 --> 01:17:35,368
Yeah, but-- with his teeth--

989
01:17:35,437 --> 01:17:36,802
''yeah, but can--

990
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:39,203
''can you play the guitar
like me, yo, son?

991
01:17:39,274 --> 01:17:40,605
Shun?''

992
01:18:02,864 --> 01:18:06,095
Twenty seven May,
movement to contact west of Restrepo.

993
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:09,898
Task disrupt, purpose prevent AAF
from building mass fires on Restrepo.

994
01:18:09,971 --> 01:18:11,598
That concludes my report. Over.

995
01:18:15,643 --> 01:18:18,043
- How long till he gets tired?
- Hump him, Walker.

996
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:19,546
Ow, my hip.

997
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:24,509
ls he squeezing you
with his fucking mammoth legs?

998
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:31,850
- Heart punch, heart punch.
- There you go, film Walker.

999
01:18:31,926 --> 01:18:33,188
Walker!

1000
01:18:35,964 --> 01:18:38,489
l think they just changed,
didn't they?

1001
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:41,000
l just want to see.

1002
01:18:41,069 --> 01:18:43,003
- Walker.
- l'm bored.

1003
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:44,732
Say something to your wife.
Dude, you know you want to.

1004
01:18:44,806 --> 01:18:46,296
Hey, babe, l miss you.

1005
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:48,035
Can't wait to get home and--

1006
01:18:51,246 --> 01:18:53,441
Hurry up, hurry up!

1007
01:18:53,515 --> 01:18:55,847
Do you want to know
when you're going home or not?

1008
01:18:57,419 --> 01:19:00,479
All right, what's been told
to the wives is

1009
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:03,056
we'll be back in ltaly,
not out of country,

1010
01:19:03,091 --> 01:19:06,254
back in ltaly between
August 4th and 7th.

1011
01:19:06,327 --> 01:19:08,352
So look at your fucking watch.

1012
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:11,456
Two months from today
and counting down.

1013
01:19:11,533 --> 01:19:14,127
That's bad news if you're
one of those dudes that's like,

1014
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:16,136
''Fuck, l love it here and l wanted
to wait till September

1015
01:19:16,204 --> 01:19:17,432
and get an extra thousand dollars.''

1016
01:19:17,505 --> 01:19:19,473
And if that's you, l don't care.

1017
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:21,509
Fuck you.
We're going home.

1018
01:19:29,017 --> 01:19:31,952
Today things were a little bit hectic.

1019
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,750
We found out that one of our sister
companies, Chosen Company,

1020
01:19:34,823 --> 01:19:37,189
up north of Camp Blessing,

1021
01:19:37,258 --> 01:19:40,421
starting a new base lost nine soldiers

1022
01:19:40,495 --> 01:19:45,023
and had an additional twelve US wounded

1023
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,092
and an thirteen additional ANA
that were wounded.

1024
01:19:51,606 --> 01:19:53,574
Hey, is this everybody?

1025
01:19:53,641 --> 01:19:55,336
We got the Mortars?
We got Second Platoon?

1026
01:19:58,146 --> 01:20:01,877
Okay, hey, listen up.

1027
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:04,248
l'm going to talk to you guys
a little bit about

1028
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:08,255
some of what happened
up with Chosen Company.

1029
01:20:08,323 --> 01:20:10,450
l want you guys to mourn,

1030
01:20:10,525 --> 01:20:13,517
and then l want you guys
to get over it and do your jobs.

1031
01:20:13,595 --> 01:20:15,460
Okay?

1032
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,725
First-- Hey, Proctor,
why did you come in the army, man?

1033
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:20,462
To fight for my country, sir.

1034
01:20:20,535 --> 01:20:22,025
- To fight for your country?
- Roger, sir.

1035
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:24,230
Did you expect that
you might get injured or die?

1036
01:20:24,305 --> 01:20:25,465
Absolutely, sir.

1037
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,940
Anybody join not knowing that
that might be an option?

1038
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:34,139
We lose PFC Vimoto on June 5th, 2007.

1039
01:20:34,215 --> 01:20:36,775
What happens the very next day
after that, Sergeant Buno?

1040
01:20:36,851 --> 01:20:41,151
We go out on patrols,
we get attacked again.

1041
01:20:41,222 --> 01:20:43,349
Right.

1042
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:46,416
July 22nd, we lose Restrepo, right?

1043
01:20:48,429 --> 01:20:50,192
What do we keep on doing after that?

1044
01:20:50,265 --> 01:20:51,289
Fighting.

1045
01:20:51,366 --> 01:20:53,561
We keep on fighting
and taking it to the enemy, right?

1046
01:20:53,635 --> 01:20:56,934
What do you guys think would have
happened if we had just stopped at Vimoto

1047
01:20:57,005 --> 01:20:59,473
and acted like
our predecessors before us

1048
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:01,805
and we stood our ground there,

1049
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:04,242
didn't go out there doing
our aggressive patrolling,

1050
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:06,440
didn't go out there
and build OP Restrepo,

1051
01:21:06,514 --> 01:21:09,176
which l think we'll all venture to say,

1052
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:12,777
like, pretty much changed the entire
dynamics of the entire valley?

1053
01:21:15,089 --> 01:21:16,488
You guys know what
would have happened?

1054
01:21:16,558 --> 01:21:19,322
The same shit that happened
today up at Chosen Company.

1055
01:21:19,394 --> 01:21:21,123
Now with Chosen Company,

1056
01:21:21,196 --> 01:21:23,892
they went into an area that they
knew was going to be contested.

1057
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:25,933
They knew what they were getting into.

1058
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,960
They've been talking about
going to Wanat since July of 2007.

1059
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:33,599
We went there, they did it.

1060
01:21:33,675 --> 01:21:35,302
The fucking only way to bounce back

1061
01:21:35,376 --> 01:21:37,207
from shit like this is to go out there

1062
01:21:37,278 --> 01:21:39,576
and make the individuals
that did this to us fucking pay.

1063
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:44,111
lt's not to sit back here and hide.

1064
01:21:44,185 --> 01:21:46,312
lt's not to go back down
to our fucking rucks

1065
01:21:46,387 --> 01:21:48,116
and fucking feel sorry for ourselves

1066
01:21:48,189 --> 01:21:49,781
and get snuggled up in our woobie.

1067
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:52,990
We go out there, we find
the motherfuckers that did this

1068
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:54,050
and we make them pay.

1069
01:21:54,128 --> 01:21:56,187
We make them feel
how we feel right now.

1070
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,590
For those of you guys that pray,

1071
01:22:00,702 --> 01:22:06,265
let's go ahead and take
a moment of silence in--

1072
01:22:06,307 --> 01:22:07,934
in remembrance the ten--

1073
01:22:08,009 --> 01:22:10,136
ten to nine soldiers that we lost today

1074
01:22:10,211 --> 01:22:12,338
and the families of them

1075
01:22:12,413 --> 01:22:15,576
and the families
of those that were hurt,

1076
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,117
and then l'll let you guys go ahead

1077
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:18,709
and get about your business.

1078
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:47,578
Get down.

1079
01:23:11,506 --> 01:23:13,133
Oh, wow, you can't see shit now.

1080
01:23:16,244 --> 01:23:18,769
Hey, can l shoot Sergeant Mac?
l'm l'm going to fucking get him.

1081
01:23:18,846 --> 01:23:19,972
- Can l shoot?
- Wait till he engages.

1082
01:23:20,048 --> 01:23:22,414
Wait till he engages,
then fucking fucking get him.

1083
01:23:26,087 --> 01:23:27,213
There he goes.

1084
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,559
Low right, low right!

1085
01:23:33,628 --> 01:23:34,617
Low right!

1086
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,565
- Hey, that motherfucker's done.
- ls he?

1087
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:45,471
Hey, Olson, he's done.

1088
01:23:47,608 --> 01:23:48,597
Yeah!

1089
01:23:48,676 --> 01:23:51,406
A direct hit on that dude.

1090
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:52,912
That motherfucker's done, man!

1091
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,175
That motherfucker's done, dude!

1092
01:23:55,249 --> 01:23:56,773
Fuck you, bitches!

1093
01:23:56,851 --> 01:23:57,943
Body parts falling apart.

1094
01:23:58,019 --> 01:23:59,543
The L-Ras, dude,

1095
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:03,249
it was him running
and then him blasting into pieces.

1096
01:24:03,358 --> 01:24:05,326
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.

1097
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,090
There you go, motherfucker,
shoot at us again.

1098
01:24:11,733 --> 01:24:15,396
By the end, like l was--

1099
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:18,268
l really didn't want to get overrun.

1100
01:24:19,374 --> 01:24:23,777
But l just wish they were closer

1101
01:24:23,845 --> 01:24:27,076
so l could have actually seen them
when l killed them.

1102
01:24:31,285 --> 01:24:32,912
626 perstat,

1103
01:24:32,987 --> 01:24:35,547
l have twenty Restrepo.

1104
01:24:35,623 --> 01:24:37,955
The only question l have is tonight,

1105
01:24:38,025 --> 01:24:42,018
are we going to be doing
an illum round for Doc Restrepo?

1106
01:24:42,096 --> 01:24:43,688
Today's twenty two July.

1107
01:24:43,765 --> 01:24:45,926
Over.

1108
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,332
Yeah, we're planning
on doing the illum round.

1109
01:24:50,638 --> 01:24:54,233
One last thing, seventeen tonight

1110
01:24:54,308 --> 01:24:56,401
they're shooting for Doc Restrepo.

1111
01:24:56,477 --> 01:24:58,274
Seventeen tonight.

1112
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,012
He's fucking a little bit drunk.

1113
01:25:02,116 --> 01:25:04,209
l'm fucking--
l'm a little bit drunk at this point.

1114
01:25:04,252 --> 01:25:05,719
And l see him--

1115
01:25:05,787 --> 01:25:08,449
l see him just eyeing everyone up,
just like this.

1116
01:25:08,523 --> 01:25:09,854
Who is that, Kim?

1117
01:25:09,924 --> 01:25:11,892
No, Restrepo.

1118
01:25:11,959 --> 01:25:13,187
Eyeing everyone up.

1119
01:25:13,261 --> 01:25:14,694
l come up to him
and l'm like, ''What's wrong, bro?''

1120
01:25:14,762 --> 01:25:15,990
He's like, ''Yo, bro,

1121
01:25:16,063 --> 01:25:18,031
l'm going to stab these fools, yo.''

1122
01:25:18,099 --> 01:25:19,930
l'm like, l see it in his hand.

1123
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:22,492
He's got the fucking Gerber
out with the knife out,

1124
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:25,562
fucking closed up, just ready
to fucking shank someone, dude.

1125
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,871
l'm like-- and this is
after the night before

1126
01:25:28,943 --> 01:25:34,313
we ended up down in the fucking
the steps of Rome fucking train station,

1127
01:25:34,382 --> 01:25:37,874
and l was peeing, in my pants.

1128
01:25:45,226 --> 01:25:48,218
What we did to mark
the anniversary of our dead,

1129
01:25:48,296 --> 01:25:49,763
we shot off flares,

1130
01:25:49,831 --> 01:25:53,699
and where Restrepo died,
we shot off flares.

1131
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,836
You know, and kind of raise one up.

1132
01:26:01,943 --> 01:26:04,810
Say a prayer,
say a few words in your head

1133
01:26:04,846 --> 01:26:06,746
and you move on.

1134
01:27:35,469 --> 01:27:38,131
Did my last patrol hopefully.

1135
01:27:38,205 --> 01:27:40,298
Hopefully l don't get called
back out for something.

1136
01:27:42,577 --> 01:27:44,272
Fly out of here in a few days.

1137
01:27:45,813 --> 01:27:49,044
lt's kind of strange thinking you'll never
come back to OP Restrepo again.

1138
01:27:49,116 --> 01:27:50,879
Yeah.

1139
01:27:50,952 --> 01:27:52,476
lt's a good feeling, though.

1140
01:27:52,553 --> 01:27:55,420
lt's been a long fucking
deployment right there.

1141
01:27:56,991 --> 01:27:59,391
Leaving Restrepo?

1142
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,655
lt's too good to be true, you know?

1143
01:28:01,762 --> 01:28:04,492
We're going to die here.
lsn't that right, Henry?

1144
01:28:04,532 --> 01:28:06,557
- Roger, Sergeant.
- But we're leaving instead.

1145
01:28:06,634 --> 01:28:09,398
God's going to fuck with our emotions

1146
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:10,994
and kill us on the bird out.

1147
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:17,166
l'm never coming back,
never coming back.

1148
01:28:18,813 --> 01:28:20,474
lt's time to go.

1149
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:26,786
That's heavy.

1150
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,191
Goodbye, OP Restrepo.

1151
01:28:36,297 --> 01:28:38,094
l'm never going to have
to be here again.

1152
01:28:41,702 --> 01:28:45,297
Not that l didn't enjoy my time here,

1153
01:28:45,373 --> 01:28:47,238
but it's time to move on.

1154
01:28:53,914 --> 01:28:56,075
- Yes!
- See you later.

1155
01:28:58,519 --> 01:29:00,578
The high point for us was going home.

1156
01:29:00,688 --> 01:29:02,622
Getting out of there.

1157
01:29:02,657 --> 01:29:05,490
Going home, seriously.
No doubt about it.

1158
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:09,017
Each one of my soldiers' face,
you can tell, going home.

1159
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:13,165
We done our job.

1160
01:29:13,234 --> 01:29:15,225
We did what we were supposed
to have been doing

1161
01:29:15,302 --> 01:29:16,792
and we out of here.

1162
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:29,674
The Korengal, as far as--
What did we we achieve?

1163
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,945
l'm always going
to think about Restrepo.

1164
01:29:32,019 --> 01:29:37,582
Building Restrepo was the single
most important event

1165
01:29:37,658 --> 01:29:40,252
for the Korengal.

1166
01:29:40,327 --> 01:29:43,353
And how...

1167
01:29:43,431 --> 01:29:44,796
how the boys did it.

1168
01:29:44,865 --> 01:29:45,854
Fighting.

1169
01:29:47,668 --> 01:29:49,761
And then turning around
and going back to working.

1170
01:30:03,017 --> 01:30:05,315
lt makes us proud
when we see the news--

1171
01:30:05,386 --> 01:30:07,718
they still call it Restrepo--

1172
01:30:07,788 --> 01:30:09,449
knowing that, you know,

1173
01:30:09,523 --> 01:30:11,718
we painted it on the walls,
this is for Doc Restrepo.

1174
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:14,784
The name fit the place after a while,

1175
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:17,490
after it became built up,

1176
01:30:17,565 --> 01:30:19,931
after it became a better place.

1177
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,525
But when l hear Restrepo,

1178
01:30:22,603 --> 01:30:25,436
l still think of the person.

1179
01:30:25,506 --> 01:30:28,498
You can't-- You can't tame the beast.

1180
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:31,271
You know?

1181
01:30:31,345 --> 01:30:32,937
Got him.

1182
01:30:33,013 --> 01:30:34,878
Yeah, he got him. He got him.

1183
01:30:34,949 --> 01:30:36,177
He did get him.

1184
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,478
Hey, Lex, what's going on tonight?

1185
01:30:37,551 --> 01:30:39,519
Just tell us.
Break it down, break it down.

1186
01:30:39,587 --> 01:30:40,849
All l want to do

1187
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:42,855
is find a miniature zebra,

1188
01:30:42,923 --> 01:30:45,551
put a little tiny saddle on it and ride it.

1189
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:48,084
There ain't no zebras on the pub crawl.

1190
01:30:48,162 --> 01:30:51,290
l didn't-- Miniature zebras.

1191
01:30:51,365 --> 01:30:55,131
My bad, there are miniature zebras.
What the fuck?

1192
01:30:55,202 --> 01:30:57,261
Let's say goodbye,
let's say goodbye.

1193
01:30:57,338 --> 01:31:00,330
Hey, tune in next time where
we're going to be still drunk as fuck.

1194
01:31:00,441 --> 01:31:01,931
Saying goodnight
to the bad guy, man.

1195
01:31:01,976 --> 01:31:03,910
The same time,
the same dope rhyme,

1196
01:31:03,978 --> 01:31:06,412
because we're going
to be still loving life

1197
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,380
and getting ready to go to war.

1198
01:33:19,813 --> 01:33:21,610
Here or hea?

1199
01:33:21,682 --> 01:33:23,673
H-E-A. Hea.

1200
01:33:25,052 --> 01:33:27,452
''O'Byrne wuz hea.''

1201
01:33:27,521 --> 01:33:28,510
That's how we roll.

1202
