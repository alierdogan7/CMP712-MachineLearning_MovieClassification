7
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,407
It's alright, doctor.

8
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,609
You can tell me, I'm not afraid.

9
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,248
Go on, I told you
I'm not afraid.

10
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,783
But you are afraid.

11
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,785
Afraid I'll tell you there's
nothing wrong with you.

12
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,753
However,
I'm not going to say that.

13
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,323
Because there is
a great deal wrong with you.

14
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,663
It's my heart, isn't it?

15
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,964
I know.

16
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,001
It-it pounds so that I can't
breathe sometimes.

17
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,870
There's nothing wrong
with your heart, organically.

18
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,507
You're sick,
but not in the way you think.

19
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:25,078
Don't try to soften it,
you see, I know.

20
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,380
I know that I'm going to die.

21
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,249
You know it because
you want to die.

22
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,651
You're willing yourself to die.

23
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,553
The physical examination
I made of you indicates

24
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,822
You are free from
bodily illness.

25
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,790
But you don't want to
accept that, do you?

26
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,260
You'd rather have me tell you
that your heart was feeling bad

27
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,394
That you were doomed

28
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,764
Than to tell you the truth.

29
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,267
- The truth?
- It's quite simple.

30
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,636
Something is making you
so desperately unhappy

31
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,572
That you'd die
rather than face it.

32
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,677
Then you don't believe
that I feel pain?

33
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,848
Of course I believe it, that
pain is pretty real, to you.

34
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,583
Oh, yes, the pain is there.

35
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,017
But it's there only because
something has happened

36
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,886
In your life that you
are not able to bear.

37
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:08,389
You've tried to forget it
and you've failed.

38
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:11,124
The pain you feel is proof
of that failure.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,894
And so it becomes a pain
to hide behind.

40
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,365
And you want a doctor to tell
you that you are sick in body.

41
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,868
Because you can't face
the sickness of your soul.

42
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,671
But don't you see,
you'll get no release?

43
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,475
A bottle of medicine, a box
of pills or surgeon's knife

44
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,744
You'll find no answer there.

45
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,447
- Where then?
- Within yourself.

46
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,048
'Meet this inner conflict.'

47
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,251
'Understand it
and then set it right.'

48
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,053
It'll not be easy.

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,990
But I think it's the only
possible help for you

50
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,226
And for the man who loves you.

51
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,797
The only way I can help him
is by letting him forget me.

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,601
Our life together...

53
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,137
Has no meaning.

54
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,939
No meaning?

55
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,975
For you or for him?

56
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,979
Not for either of us.

57
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,850
Because of me, I've tried
to be the way I was before.

58
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,753
I've tried to go on,
but I can't.

59
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,988
I can't let him touch me,
doctor.

60
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,859
He's so good, he's so kind.
It's not-it's not fair.

61
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,528
But you shut him out.

62
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,565
The way you shut him out of
your heart and your mind.

63
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,834
He's suffered enough.

64
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,536
I'm not gonna let him
suffer anymore.

65
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,538
I'm not going back to him.

But it's no use.

68
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:40,714
I have nothing left for him... or
for anyone.

69
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,452
Marise, I knew your father and
mother when they were alive.

70
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,286
I watched you grow up.

71
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,589
You were a child
well worth watching.

72
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,558
You always had courage.

73
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,328
- Have you changed?
- Yes.

74
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,229
That's not possible.

75
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,299
The girl I remember
faced life without fear.

76
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:02,002
She went to work to care for
her widowed mother.

77
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,372
Met the young fisherman
from Brittany one day

78
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,873
Married him the next.

79
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,710
No, that girl will
always have courage.

80
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,048
You are right about one thing.

81
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:20,688
When I first met Paul,
in those days I wasn't afraid.

82
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,290
From the moment he looked at me,
I knew.

83
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,725
I think he did too.

84
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,194
We talked and he told me
about his country.

85
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,733
The people and his fishing fleet
and his boat house in the sea.

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,570
All at once, it was
my country too.

87
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:41,341
Oh, we were happy, doctor,
so happy.

88
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,111
But it lasted such
a little while.

89
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,979
Why, Marise?

90
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:49,082
Why? Well, the war.

91
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,985
Paul was one of the first to go.

92
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:57,090
Then, few letters.
After that, silence.

93
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,761
Go on, Marise.

94
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:04,532
He was in a reprisal camp.

95
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,133
It was one of the worst.

Why did you start
that song again?

106

I won't get it out of
my head all night.

107
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,669
The first day
I met her in Paris.

108
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,972
They played it over
and over that day.

109
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,909
Let me see her picture again,
Aubert.

110
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,911
Wait for the light.

111
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,947
Be careful, Renaud.

112
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:32,419
It's her hair,
a man notices...

113
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,987
And her skin.

114
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:38,058
- White skin, red hair.
- I know.

115
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,095
"Carrot top," that's what
I used to call her.

Then say all of it,
Marise Aubert, that's her name.

119

- Marise Aubert.
- Alright.

120
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,578
You've told me that before,
I know she's your wife.

121
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,749
My girl from Paris.

122
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,784
Born and brought up there.

123
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,852
You wouldn't think
she'd fit in

124
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,954
As a fisherman's wife,
would you?

125
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,656
'But she did.'

126
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,490
'She was so happy.'

127
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,894
- 'You know, that she was?'
- 'I'd stake my life on it.'

128
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,030
'She loved my people.
They loved her too.'

129
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,900
'As soon as they got used
to her funny little ways.'

130
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,805
There was one thing they didn't
understand for a while.

131
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:29,777
She had no use for keys,
always forgot to lock the doors.

132
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,880
"If they are friends, we don't
want them out," she said.

133
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:36,483
"If they are enemies,
let them come in."

134
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,852
"We'll make friends of them."

135
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,923
She trusted people... everyone.

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,958
You trust her,
don't you, Aubert?

137
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:49,396
Five years away?
You're still sure of her?

138
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,531
As I am of God.

139
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,301
Yes, I'm sure of Marise.

140
00:08:54,367 --> 00:09:00,373
As sure as I am that someday,
someday I'll be going back home.

141
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,443
(Paul narrating)
Home, under my own flag.

142
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,413
To my own country, Brittany.

143
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,984
Where I was born and my father
and his father before him.

144
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,287
I'll go along the road
I know so well.

145
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,356
Yes, so well.

146
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:21,094
And all at once, there will be
that wonderful sea coast.

147
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,731
The place where you
turn off the road.

148
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,767
Our way to the house.

149
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,969
I'll be on
my own ground once more.

150
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,942
I'll look down at the
whirlpool, always changing

151
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:39,613
Yet always the same,
since I was a boy.

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,683
From there I can see
the path.

153
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,019
I'll start down.

154
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,989
A little way
and I'll come to the shrine.

155
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,991
It's been there forever
I guess.

156
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,226
As long as I remember, anyhow.

157
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,397
Marise never passed it
without touching it.

158
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,799
For luck.

159
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,770
(Jean)
Then?

160
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,473
(Paul)
When I get to the beach,
I'll look up.

161
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,109
And there will be our house.

162
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,911
Now, think,
as I always do

163
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,813
When I've been away
for a while

164
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,514
It looks lonely.

165
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,549
It never was though.

166
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,886
Not for me.

167
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,689
Not after
I brought her there.

168
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,590
Not that we had
many visitors.

169
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,827
The village priest sometimes.

170
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,062
Postman almost every day.

171
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,631
He was an old friend
named Alex.

172
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,801
Knew everybody.

173
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,003
And everybody's business too.

174
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh, Alex.

175
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,975
Hello! How are ya?

176
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,376
Hello.

177
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,378
Who are you?

178
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,784
[Instrumental music]

179
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:10,070
(Paul)
She'd always forget
to lock the door.

180
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,405
"If they're friends, we don't
want to keep them out"

181
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,974
She said.

182
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,544
"If they're enemies,
why then... let them in."

183
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,947
"We'll make friends of them."

184
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,282
She trusted people.

185
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,284
Everyone.

186
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,323
Marise?

187
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,430
The cottage was very old
and simple.

188
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,532
Full of pleasant things.

189
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,169
Some mine, some hers.

190
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,905
She promised
there'd be nothing changed.

191
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,775
Don't matter how long
the war lasted.

192
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,377
We were proud of the piano.

193
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,679
It'd been my mothers.

194
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,982
She used to teach
the children of Kergat on it

195
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,617
In the old days.

196
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,820
My chair stood by the fire.

197
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,654
She sent to Paris for it.

198
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,623
It was comfortable.

199
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,826
Big enough for both of us.

200
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,432
[Instrumental music]

201
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,241
[Sighing]
Ah.

202
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,343
Ah, ha ha ha.

203
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,554
The kitchen
was always scrubbed

204
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,756
And full of good smells.

205
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,794
Only one thing wrong.

206
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,331
There was a gas jet
that whistled.

207
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:47,500
She was going to do something
about that but...

208
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,303
She never did.

209
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,906

213
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,421
Paul!

214
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:17,057
I knew you weren't dead.

215
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,468
Oh, no.

216
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,470
I thought you were Paul.

217
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,507
I thought you were my husband.

218
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,509
Why did you think that?

219
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,913
That song...

220
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,748
How did you come to
know that song?

221
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,951
I've heard it often enough.

222
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,054
Your song, Marise.

223
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,556
My name, you know that too.

224
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,024
Why shouldn't I?

225
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,161
I've said it often enough,
over and over.

226
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,629
[Whispering]
Marise.

227
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,231
Marise.

228
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,202
Yes, I know your names,
I know this house.

229
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,737
The chair by the fire,
the piano.

230
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,007
The gas jet in the kitchen.

231
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,576
'Glad you didn't fix that,
Marise.'

[Thunder rumbling]

233
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,555
The weather this time of year,
that's an old friend too.

234
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:27,094
Rain at night,
bright sky in the morning.

235
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,629
Even that dress your wearing.

236
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,199
One you bought in Morley.

237
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,401
"Expensive," you said,
"but good quality."

238

[Instrumental music]

239
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,675
Who are you?

240
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,013
Does my name matter?

241
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,916
Why did you come here?

242
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,119
How do you know these things?

243
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,657
Paul told you.

244
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,462
You know Paul?

245
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,464
I knew him.

246
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,001
Knew him?

247
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,638
Don't say it...

248
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,806
As if...

249
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,575
As if he were...

250
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,145
I wont believe that.

251
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,780
No, it's not true.

252
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,615
They sent me papers and...

253
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,052
And documents and...

254
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,287
I tell you,
I wont believe it.

255
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,092
I saw him die, Marise.

256
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,295
[Thunder rumbling]

257
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,777
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,489
They...

259
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,725
They said he was killed

260
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,128
Trying to escape
from the reprisal camp.

261
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,699
Go on.

262
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,103
Tell me exactly how it happened.

263
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,706
It won't be easy
for you.

264
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,346
Paul lived for one thing.

265
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,548
To get away,
to get back to you.

266
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,419
He worked out a plan
for an escape.

267
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,089
It was a long chance
but he was ready for it.

268
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,059
So were some of the rest of us.

269
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,896
And when the time came...

270
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,433
I found myself next to Paul.

271
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,402

the barbed wire.

272
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,104

273
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,374
Cut off from the rest.

274
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,743
At first, luck was with us.

275
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,579
We thought we'd made it.

I didn't come here for that.

Now just try
and tell that those aren't

543
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,145
The best shrimps
you ever tasted.

544
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,781
Ah. It brings Mormant
right back to me.

545
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,451
Mormant or Montparnasse?

546
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,253
All of Paris.

547
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,123
You know, Jean?

548
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,058
It's no fun to cook when...

549
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,727
When you're alone?

550
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,529
Mm-hmm.

551
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,230
I'll tell you another thing.

552
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,800
You don't care much about eating
either when you're worried, so...

553
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,302
You don't cook,
you don't eat...

554
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,504
You don't live.

555
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:58,477
- Well...
- That was what you meant.

556
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:00,679
You're not eating.
Here.

557
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,049
Look at me, Marise.

558
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,653
Now, uh, smile again.

559
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,689
With your eyes too.

560
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,891
You're eyes show
what's in your heart.

561
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,463
There, that's better.

562
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,599
Not good enough,
but better.

Marise?

568
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:18,089
No, Jean.
Not that one.

569
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,492
You'll play it for me someday,
Marise.

570
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,596
No, Jean.

573
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,373
Let go!

574
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,341
Oh, Jean... oh, put me down.

575
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,577
Okay, fine.

576
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,979
Oh, put me down...

577
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,948
I had a wonderful day.

578
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,396
(Father Donnard)
'Good morning, Marise.'

579
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,931
Good morning.

580
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,507
Good morning, father.

581
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,245
This is Jean Renaud, father.

582
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,948
He was with Paul in prison camp.

583
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:53,952
Ah, so you've come because
you are Paul's friend.

584
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,186
Hardly, father.

585
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,422
So you knew Paul Aubert.

586
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,691
You were privileged, my son.

587
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,227
He was that rare a thing,
a man liked by everyone.

588
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,663
Rich and poor, wicked and pious.

589
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,633
He was also the best fisherman
in Kergat.

590
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,668
The good women of the town
were quite put out

591
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:13,104
When he brought Marise back
from Paris with him.

592
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,174
Hey, my child?

593
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,709
I see.

594
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,911
For once,
the fisherman was the catch.

595
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,651
Father, may we offer you
a glass of wine?

596
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,856
Please, will you sit down,
father?

597
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,225
Only for a moment.

598
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,229
This is a busy day for me.

599
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,330
And early tomorrow morning

600
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:40,599
I go to the neighboring villages

601
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43.168
'In Giles
for the pardons.'

602
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:44,536
The "pardons?"

603
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,872
That's what we call
these festivals here.

604
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,874
The people from all over
the countryside journey

605
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,843
Someone-for some by boat
to one of the shrines

606
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,378
To obtain the
intersession of a saint

607
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,081
And bring the blessing of God
into their households.

608
00:41:56,147 --> 00:41:58,617
Oh, yes,
I've heard about the pardons.

609
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,085
And afterwards,
they drink a lot of wine

610
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,654
Dance all day
and make love all night.

611
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,357
I don't like
your implication, my son.

612
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:10,261
The church doesn't expect to
change human nature by ritual.

613
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,963
And what's more natural
than friends meeting

614
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,133
And enjoying themselves
after the services.

615
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,669
And making love?

616
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,738
Many couples
are honorably betrothed

617
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:21,506
At our religious festivals.

618
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,042
And that too
is natural and fitting.

619
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,914
I don't know your plans, but
if you're staying in Kergat

620
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,349
Can I help you
find a place to live?

621
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,252
I'm used to taking care of
myself, thank you, father.

622
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,159
Goodbye, my child.

623
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,094
I'll go a little way
with you, father.

624
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,963
Thank you, Marise.

625
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,670
Goodbye, father.

626
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:52,971
'Marise, wouldn't it be
more sensible'

627
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55.173
'To change your wet clothes?'

628
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,176
[Instrumental music]

629
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,191
I know why you're crying
even if you don't.

630
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,994
- It's because I'm so ashamed.
- Oh, no.

631
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,064
That's not it.

632
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,900
It's because he spoiled
something by coming here.

633
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,635
What did you mean
by acting as if I were...

634
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,871
Your wife,
as if this were your house?

635
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,338
You're trying to make him think
you had the right?

636
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:28,974
You would have been in my arms
if it hadn't been for him.

637
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,676
Don't say that,
don't think it or I'll...

638
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,177
Or you'll do what?

639
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,179
Tell me to go?

640
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:35,847
- I'm sorry, but...
- Of course you're sorry!

641
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,182
Women love to pity.

642
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,750
Especially men who'll fetch
and carry for them

643
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:39,918
And be tamed as a dog
about the house

644
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,319
But I don't want your pity,
thank you!

645
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,921
- You'll get no more of it.
- That's good!

646
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:45,356
- But before you go...
- Oh, I am to go, eh?

647
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:46,758
Of course.

648
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:51,396
Don't you think
you'll miss me, Marise?

649
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,032
Look at yourself. That's the
face of a woman who's alive.

650
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,868
You didn't look like that
the first night I saw you.

651
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,203
Even those tears in your eyes

652
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:00,505
Are happier
than the one I saw then.

653
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,674
What's made the change?

654
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:03,809
Ah, you've been
alone long enough

655
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,310
With your thoughts of Paul?

656
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:09,414
But he's dead now and I'm not
gonna let you die with him.

657
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,817
You were his friend. Something...

658
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,119
Something overflowed
from him to you.

659
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:17,122
If there's been any change
at all, it's because of that.

660
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:19,624
If you seemed to belong in
my life these last few days

661
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,760
And I belonged in yours

662
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,762
It's because of that.

663
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,297
You're only here
because of Paul.

664
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,167
Only because of Paul?

665
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:33,271
I suppose I've... needed
someone to talk with and...

666
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,007
To be with...

667
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,810
I've liked you being here.

668
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,746
But it was wrong.

669
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,547
I was wrong.

670
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,751
[Instrumental music]

671
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,124
Marise, wait.

672
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,328
If you knew the way I feel,
you wouldn't be angry.

673
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,802
Once when the police
were chasing me

674
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,436
And some other kids through
the streets in Paris

675
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:06,537
I came to a church.

676
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:07,773
I ran in to hide.

677
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,540
I even pretended to be praying.

678
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,176
Then suddenly I was praying.

679
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,343
Me!

680
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,379
I didn't want to go back
to thieving in the alleys

681
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,381
I wanted to stay.

682
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,683
And that's the way I feel now.

683
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,985
You're the chance I want.

684
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,888
The chance I need
to be different. Better!

685
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:25,590
Oh, don't send me away.

686
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,192
I'd miss staying near you.

687
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,794
For a little while.

688
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,461
Just a little while longer.

Yes.

693
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,342
Stay.

694
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:51,149
Let's go to the pardons
tomorrow, Marise.

695
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:52,417
Why?

696
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,286
Why does anyone go to the
pardons except to ask pardon.

Yes.

699
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,059
I should go.

700
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:05,230
Why do you want to go?

701
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,098
Perhaps to... pray.

702
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,569
Perhaps to dance with you
afterwards.

Marise, it's like a holiday

708

Probably useless.

897
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:13,811
Sea air is not good for guns.

898
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:24,188
Somehow, I never thought I'd
find myself selling this place.

899
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,157
But what would we do
with boats and paddles?

[Music continues]

901
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,532
And I'm sorry we're going.

902
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,601
And I'm sorry
you belong with me now.

903
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:39,236
Do I belong with you, Jean?

904
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,838
For the rest of your life.

905
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:42,606
It means so much to you then?

906
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:46,543
So much? Listen to me, Marise.

907
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,978
I'll never let you
get away from me.

908
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,915
Remember that.
No matter what happens.

909
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,117
[Sighing]
What could happen?

910
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,519
Well, you know...

911
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:58,723
You could talk some more
about hating to sell this place.

912
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,557
You could go on
keeping ghosts alive.

913
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:04,328
But, Jean, my memories of Paul
take nothing away from you.

914
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,562
Well, I won't share you.

[Music continues]

916
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:10,868
We'll make our own memories.

917
01:01:10,935 --> 01:01:12,402
We'll start
by getting rid of this.

918
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,404
Oh, no, no, Jean. No.

919
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:19,710
I didn't know that Paul
had kept it.

920
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:24,214
Ah, don't be angry.

921
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,416
[Sighing]
It's no good
to hold on to the past.

922
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:32,957
Jean, when we finish here

923
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,393
Would you come over
to Father Donnard with me?

924
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,795
Why?

925
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,997
His blessing would mean
a great deal to me.

926
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:43,834
Why not, then?

927
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:45,102
There's no reason
why the good priest

928
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:46,636
Shouldn't give us his blessing

929
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,806
And why we shouldn't take it.

930
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:51,308
You're not a religious man,
are you?

931
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,878
Only frightened people
are religious.

932
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:58,448
That's not true.

933
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:00,450
Don't say it.

934
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,419
Alright, it's not true.

935
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:03,520
I won't say it.

Hello, there!

940
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,737
Come on up.

941
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:22,807
I'm late.

942
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,009
I confess I didn't miss you.

943
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,616
Hector Martin, Jean Renaud.

944
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:33,884
Oh, yes. I've heard of you.

945
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,520
The sharpest businessman
in Kergat, they say.

946
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,255
I've heard of you.

947
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:40,424
Well, I've come prepared
to set a price.

948
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,161
I'm sure it'll be a fair one,
Hector.

949
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:46,563
I'm glad that you're the buyer.

950
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,434
You knew Paul and-and you'll
run the business the way that...

951
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:57,041
Hector, would you mind settling
all this with Jean Renaud

952
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,308
Instead of with me?

953
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:01,511
I've been over
everything with him.

954
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,780
An-and, Jean, if you'll forgive
me, I'll meet you over

01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:05,883
At Father Donnard's.

956
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,085
Of course, Marise.

01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,889

It's all here.
Just what we have to offer.

961

A good business for someone.

962
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:57,767
Yes, it took Paul Aubert
a long time to make it there.

963
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,636
A very long time.

964
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:00,905
And much work.

965
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,140
Well...

966
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:05,342
You'll expect to pay well
for that effort, eh?

967
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,516
Thank you.

- Oh.

Father, I've been going through
some of Paul's belongings

973
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,700
And I found this.

974
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:32,436
And I want you to have it.

01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:33,603
Oh.

01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:37,507
I think Paul would
want that too.

I repeat, are you sure?

take Paul's place with me.

And I need him, father.

- What do you mean?

at once, you leave Kergat.

has gone to him.

He told me how... how you
were shot down trying to escape.

Waiting for you.
Until he came.

1130
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:42,666
And told me
that he saw you die.

1131
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:46,369
I had to believe it then.

1132

that it wasn't true.

now that I am, does it?

let me know, Paul?

I could, from the hospital.

- Two weeks ago.

With what was left of me,
I-I felt sorry for him.

1145

He seemed so lost,
and I was lonely.

you feel for me?

what did anything matter?

you were alive

And I promised to marry
another man.

if a thing like this happened.

1166
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:10,780
- How long has he been here?
- A week.

1167
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,982
Perhaps, a little longer.

1168
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:18,822
Maybe my letter did come.
Maybe Renaud stole it.

You think Jean
would steal?

1170
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:25,895
He was a thief
and coward in camp

1171
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:28,031
Why shouldn't he be a thief
and coward here?

- I don't know.

places he can hide.

and let me send him away.

me to find him?

that I was alive.

you, Paul. Most of us are weak.

away, but you didn't ask me why.

1185

And that's important.

1186

He didn't seem
like a stranger.

1187
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:14,911
He seemed to belong here.
He knew about us, Paul.

1188

could've told him.

1189

too much about you

1190

1243
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:17,753
(Dr. Leclair)
No, Marise. Not because
of you.

1244
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:21,657
That man was so formed,
so deformed by life.

1245
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:23,892
That what he did was part
of his pattern.

1246
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:26,629
The pattern he was forced
into by a society

1247
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,798
Which, which sends its children
out into the streets

1248
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:33,035
To lie and thieve
in order to live.

1249
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:38,073
Remember this, the only
happiness Jean ever had

1250
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,575
He had through you.

1251
01:29:39,642 --> 01:29:43,812
He came closest to redemption
through you.

1252
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:47,550
Go back to him, Marise.
Go back to man you love

1253
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:49,151
And who loves you.

1254
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,020
Go into his arms,
naturally, gladly

1255
01:29:52,087 --> 01:29:54,423
Freely as you
did once.

1256
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:57,192
Help him to build
his life again.

1257
01:29:57,259 --> 01:29:59,562
Go on together, Marise.

1258
01:29:59,628 --> 01:30:00,963
Together.

1259
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:08,771

1260
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:29,157
