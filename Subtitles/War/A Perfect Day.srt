1
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,494
Stop, stop. Stop!

2
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:09,819
Come on, sneaky.
Hang in there. You can make it.

3
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:46,456
Are you okay?

4
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,235
Fat fuck.

5
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:04,874
He didn't go hungry in the war.

6
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,543
It might be his glands.

7
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:12,182
They're called glands, right?

8
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:17,818
Thyroid does not produce enough hormones
so body does not assimilate fat.

9
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,687
Glands. My brother told me that.

10
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:24,628
- Yeah, your brother is a doctor?
- No, fatso.

11
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:34,634
What are they laughing at?

12
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:37,037
He's just saying funny things, you know.

13
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:40,707
- Yeah, I can tell that.
- It's normal here.

14
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:45,615
This area is famous for that.
Yoghurt and sense of humor.

15
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:51,187
They always say funny things.
That's why people invite them to weddings.

16
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:55,655
Trust Damir, when you get married
invite somebody from here.

17
00:04:55,755 --> 00:05:00,763
They're always laughing.
Babies here are born laughing, not crying.

18
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:05,966
Most famous comedian
in my country is born here.

19
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,835
Petrovich. You know Petrovich?

20
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,502
No, I don't know Petrovich.

21
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:15,430
He tells famous Albanian in bathtub joke.

22
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,979
- It's great.
- Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.

23
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,516
He tells it for 30 years and people
always laugh every time he tells.

24
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:26,186
30 years, always same joke.

25
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:29,189
Yeah, and that might be him in the well.

26
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,028
Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.

27
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:41,388
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.</i>

28
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,973
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1, come in.</i>

29
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:49,812
Copy, Mambru! This is B! Go!

30
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,147
<i>Do you have any rope in the car? Over.</i>

31
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,516
I can't hear you. Come back with that!

32
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:59,419
<i>Do you have any rope in the car? Over.</i>

33
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,989
- Negative. No rope. No rope on board.
- <i>Okay.</i>

34
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,393
- <i>We'll be out of here in 15. Over and out.</i>
- Copy that. Over and out.

35
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,957
Watch where you step.

36
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:38,661
They want us to drive around it.

37
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,028
How do you know?

38
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,667
It's a trap.

39
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,203
See that grass there?

40
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,640
They dragged it here.

41
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,307
See, they put mines on one side

42
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:57,744
so that when you drive around it,
boom. Game over.

43
00:06:57,844 --> 00:07:00,183
The question is which side?

44
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,249
Well, we'd better turn around.

45
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,151
- They would expect us to go right.
- You think so?

46
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:08,955
But if we were coming
from the other side, then...

47
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,558
right would be left, so...

48
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:14,594
B, there was another road back there.

49
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:17,130
Maybe they know.

50
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,165
- Maybe they know what?
- Maybe they know we know.

51
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,603
- Yeah, but we don't know!
- Unless they're fucking with us.

52
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:27,640
Well, come on, B. Just... Let's turn around.
There was another road back there...

53
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,908
- You hear that?
- No.

54
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,578
- That!
- What?

55
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:34,784
- RPGs.
- What's that?

56
00:07:35,948 --> 00:07:37,750
- Grenades.
- No, I didn't hear any grenades.

57
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,086
Oui, oui, oui, yeah.
No way we're going back that way.

58
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:42,389
That's not gonna happen.

59
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:45,058
Mr. cow...

60
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,861
is it to the left or to the right?

61
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,200
You're asking the cow?

62
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,969
Let's go.

63
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,673
- Are we turning around?
- RPGs.

64
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,846
It's all here in my logbook.

65
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,713
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking it up.

66
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:09,716
- Mining protocol says to turn around.
- Mining protocol.

67
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,285
Don't believe everything
you read in mining protocol.

68
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:14,421
They write that stuff in Geneva.

69
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,756
They've never seen a mine
in their lives in Geneva.

70
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:20,460
Cows, yes, plenty of cows
but none with mines around 'em.

71
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,696
This is my protocol, not Geneva.

72
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:25,866
There it is.

73
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,845
What? Is that my handwriting?
What the fuck does that say...

74
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,125
But I don't know what it says.
It says to turn around.

75
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,242
No, look. Look, right there.
What is that? That's a cow.

76
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:37,202
- It's a dog.
- It's not a dog.

77
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:40,847
- Yes, it's a dog...
- Dogs don't have horns. That's a cow.

78
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:44,453
That's an arrow and it says to go right.

79
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:48,288
Or left?

80
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:51,658
Oh, fuck it. We're late.

81
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,127
- We're sick of cows.
- No, no! What are you doing...

82
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,596
Arrows and all of this fucking bullshit.

83
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:59,699
No, no, no! No, we have to go back, B!

84
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,435
Oh, no, please! We have
to go back! Don't you dare...

85
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:06,511
- Catch a tiger by the toe.
- No, no, no. Oh, no.

86
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,794
If he hollers...

87
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:22,959
Putain! I hate you! I just... I hate you.

88
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,963
I hate you! Fucking crazy!

89
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:35,238
They brought him from somewhere else
and throw into well to spoil water.

90
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:41,477
They hear them when they came with car.
With loud music, boom, boom, boom.

91
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:46,212
When they came out this morning,
fat guy was in well.

92
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:48,117
Well.

93
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,751
He wants to know where you're from.

94
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:55,054
- Puerto Rico.
- Puerto Rico. American.

95
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,225
- Piculin Ortiz.
- Yes, Piculin Ortiz...

96
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:04,440
- Great basketball player.
- Yes, very good. Piculin Ortiz, very good.

97
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,703
He asks why you're here. Don't you
have woman who loves you at home?

98
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:14,102
Tell him I do. That's why I'm here.

99
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,818
He says you're funny like you're from here.
You know, the same sense of humor.

100
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,522
Okay.

101
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,824
I'll never get in a car with you again,
you got that? Never again.

102
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:38,298
- What happened?
- He doesn't give a shit about rules.

103
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:41,901
She wanted to go one way, me, another.
It's always the same with chicks.

104
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,937
You ran over a cow!
We could have blown up!

105
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:47,040
- I consulted my notebook.
- Your notebook?

106
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,479
You're not gonna say anything?

107
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:55,951
- Shit, B.
- Shit, B?

108
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:58,785
Is that all?

109
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,893
What do you want me to say?

110
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,690
I'm... I don't know.
You're in charge of security here.

111
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,559
What will you do next?
Send him to bed without dessert?

112
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,129
Dessert? I didn't know
there was dessert here.

113
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,265
Mambru, everything was under control.

114
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:16,135
You know me. There was nothing crazy
about it. Intuitive, maybe. But not crazy.

115
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,171
Sophie.

116
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:21,708
He knew there was nothing
underneath that cow.

117
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,547
He was just... showing off for you.

118
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,614
Sophie, come on! Sophie.

119
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:32,752
She's adorable!
And you are getting no respect from her.

120
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:35,261
Did you know about this dessert?

121
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,462
Glad I only got one more week here.

122
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,632
Oh, putain!

123
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,968
What?

124
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,170
- It's a dude!
- I know it's a dude.

125
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,124
- You said a corpse on the radio.
- So?

126
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:55,975
A corpse could be anything.
It could be a dog, a pig, a...

127
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:59,078
Sophie, a corpse is a corpse.

128
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,715
- A dead dog is not a corpse.
- She's French.

129
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,884
A dead dog is corpse...

130
00:12:04,984 --> 00:12:06,989
technically.

131
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:11,493
- Is this her first?
- Yep.

132
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,865
He's gigantic.

133
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:21,501
- Is he from the village?
- No.

134
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:24,404
They brought this guy from somewhere else.

135
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:27,750
- I thought they do it with animals.
- Not in war.

136
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,878
Nobody throws an animal in a well.
Wasted food.

137
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,650
B, give me a hand with the pipe.

138
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:38,918
For how long has he been in the well?

139
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:42,091
12 hours. 10, maybe.

140
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,624
So what's our expert say?

141
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,959
We have to get it out and clean the well.

142
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,896
In 24 hours, it won't matter
what we pour in there.

143
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:53,733
- We'll have to seal it.
- We'll get the blue helmets to help.

144
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:58,504
At least this one's in one piece.
They usually chop it up, you know.

145
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,007
It speeds up the decay.

146
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:04,777
It's disgusting, but...
there's a good side to it.

147
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:07,413
It gets easier to get 'em out of there

148
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,719
you know, when they're...
when they're in chunks.

149
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:15,825
- So, you know.
- Hey.

150
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:21,354
He says there's a small store
in Drusina Village. It's nearby.

151
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:24,033
And they might have rope there.

152
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:31,040
Is... is he your first, dogs aside?

153
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,741
Really?

154
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:37,043
Unbelievable.

155
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:40,780
It's important moment, your first corpse.
You never forget it.

156
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,183
It's like your first girlfriend
or the first time you get laid.

157
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:47,003
I remember the first time I got laid
but my first corpse,

158
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:49,858
that shit is burned in my memory.

159
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:53,393
I'll never forget that face, man.

160
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:56,662
- Was it terrible?
- No, it wasn't terrible.

161
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,998
It was... it was nice.

162
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:03,069
She was... 17, red head, nice body.

163
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,538
- The corpse?
- No, my...

164
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:09,452
The girl, the first girl I slept with.
What's wrong with you?

165
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,444
That's sick.

166
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:16,048
Sophie! You're gonna ride with me
to the security briefing.

167
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:20,490
- B, you're going with Damir to Drusina.
- Drusina.

168
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,702
There are 2 more wells to the west.

169
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,773
About 12 kilometers...

170
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,605
in Nisinje.

171
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,442
Yeah, they were both mined last week.

172
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:47,580
We informed Unprofor
but it'll take a while to demine them.

173
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,050
Even if wells are a priority... it's gonna
take at least a couple days...

174
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,018
Attention!

175
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,457
Oh, fuck!

176
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,827
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

177
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,098
Don't touch him!

178
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:08,188
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

179
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,643
Hey, hey, hey, calm down, calm down.

180
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,180
- What?
- That's my ball!

181
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,682
That's his ball. He's a little boy.
Give him his ball. Give him back his ball.

182
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:25,823
It's his ball. He's a kid.

183
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:29,625
No, no, no, no, no.

184
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:34,827
Sophie, get back in the car.

185
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:38,097
We're friends, friends.
We go, we go, we leave.

186
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:42,001
Friends. Nema problema.
Nema problema, okay?

187
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:44,937
We go, we go.

188
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:47,874
Get back. You wanna get killed?

189
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:50,913
Get in the car. Get in the car.

190
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:55,047
- What's your name?
- Nikola.

191
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:58,985
Nikola, how about I get you
a new ball, brand-new ball?

192
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:00,620
Where?

193
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,423
Base camp. Soldiers have ball. Deal?

194
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:07,263
- You pick ball and I drive you back.
- Deal.

195
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:38,758
That Frenchy whatsome has got
a mouth on her. Let me tell you.

196
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,761
Mambru wouldn't have taken that shit
from anyone couple of years ago.

197
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:45,467
He would have thrown her
in the well with the fat fucker.

198
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,935
He's good at what he does
but he has not been the same lately.

199
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:53,242
He's... talking about giving it all up.

200
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:57,643
You see, there's this girl...

201
00:16:57,743 --> 00:16:59,645
back home...

202
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,014
waiting for him.

203
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,151
White picket fence, homemade apple pie,

204
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:09,055
swings set out back. You know,
the whole kit and caboodle.

205
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:12,695
He's not the same. He's just like
he's here, but he's not here.

206
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,496
- You know what I mean?
- No.

207
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:22,151
What I'm saying is even though
he's here, he is not here.

208
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,857
He is somewhere else.

209
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:30,309
Women, Damir! They change you.

210
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,846
I got changed by one too.
I wasn't always like this.

211
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:35,306
- Like what?
- Like I am now.

212
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,449
Were you more articulate?

213
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,710
Shit, Damir. You're an interpreter.
Interpret me, for fuck's sake.

214
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:52,534
What the fuck.

215
00:17:57,904 --> 00:18:02,345
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2, this is Mike 1. Come in.</i>

216
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,379
Yeah, copy. What's up?

217
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,785
<i>Besides rope, I need a ball. Over.</i>

218
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:13,455
Come back with that.
What... what was that?

219
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:16,622
<i>Ball. Bravo Alfa Lima Lima.</i>

220
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,558
<i>A soccer ball.</i>

221
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:23,805
- Can you understand this guy?
- Perfectly. He said ball, right?

222
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,614
Eldar!

223
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:17,716
- Turn the car around!
- There is no problem here.

224
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:21,720
Well, the front facing out,
ready to leave. Come on, Nikola, get in.

225
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,622
I already have 3 kids.

226
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:27,562
You stay with Eldar,
I go inside and get ball.

227
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:29,562
Okay?

228
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:32,264
- Who's leaving?
- Coming.

229
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:35,368
I just come from airport
to pick up new lady.

230
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:38,592
New lady? What's her name?

231
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:43,042
I forget. When I saw her,
I forget everything. Even war.

232
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,146
She hot?

233
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:48,016
How hot?

234
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:52,585
3? Out of 10?

235
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:56,359
- Out of 3.
- 3 out of 3?

236
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,862
She Russian?

237
00:20:02,962 --> 00:20:05,531
I told you, I forget.

238
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:08,170
Okay. Turn the car around.

239
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:14,473
- 3 what?
- Nothing, 3 days.

240
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:18,213
He hasn't slept in 3 days. Fucking war.

241
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:19,192
[- What's the Russian doing here?
- Who do you mean?]

242
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,567
[That nutcase, Katya.]

243
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:25,717
[Did you know she wrote Sarah
three letters? Very nice letters.]

244
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,551
[Describing our little affair
in wonderful detail.]

245
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:39,067
[Now she's here and I knew nothing of it.]

246
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,609
[That's not fair, Goyo.]

247
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:43,682
[Maybe we should have consulted you, right?]

248
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:48,142
[Well, I'm head of security, but who cares?]

249
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:51,734
[Goyo, this is basically another war.]

250
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,484
[What do we have to do?]

251
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:57,009
[Ask you whenever we move somebody,
in case you poked her?]

252
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,734
[Don't exaggerate.
All I'm saying is let me know first.]

253
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:03,984
[Tune me in, grab the radio and say,]

254
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:06,912
["Mambrú, the Russian's coming in Saturday,]

255
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:11,151
[then she's leaving. Over and out."
Simple as that, but no...]

256
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:14,859
[She's staying four days,
writing her evaluation, then going.]

257
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,709
[Hold on...]

258
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:20,542
[Are you calling off the operation?]

259
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,934
[Come on, she'll tell you.]

260
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:26,672
We've registered very little military
activity since the cease-fire

261
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,579
came into effect.

262
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,112
There've been... minor altercations...

263
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:35,648
but I repeat, the area is quite calm.

264
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,818
- The conflict, as you know, is nearly over.
- Fucking idiots.

265
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:41,453
- Peace agreements underway...
- What's wrong?

266
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:46,525
...an obligation for all parties
to facilitate the location of mines

267
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,963
or any other threat to humanitarian
and United Nations' personnel

268
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:54,169
but as you know, that isn't always easy.

269
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:59,038
Water. Our sector is supplied by 3 wells.

270
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:01,807
Davari and Nisinje are still mined

271
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:06,078
but the third is functional with enough
capacity to supply the surrounding villages.

272
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,183
Excuse me, sir.

273
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:11,684
Negative.
The third well is not functional.

274
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:14,153
- We were just there.
- What's wrong with it?

275
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:17,389
Somebody threw a corpse in it
to contaminate the water.

276
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,062
Someone should remove it.

277
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:23,929
The mines are our priority.

278
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,602
But then remove the mines
from the other two.

279
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:33,172
- Please identify yourself.
- Sophie Richard...

280
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:37,278
water and sanitation, aid across borders.

281
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:40,245
According to my reports,
that well is clean.

282
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:43,449
Well, but according to my nose
there is a body rotting inside.

283
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,556
So it must be removed,
so we can purify the water.

284
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,363
Hey.

285
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:58,300
Madam!

286
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,070
Ma'am!

287
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:04,956
Get out of there!

288
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:09,241
Get out of there!

289
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:11,477
Careful.

290
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,199
You're gonna get yourself killed.

291
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,989
What's she saying?

292
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:26,995
They ask her to stop
'cause there could be mines in the field.

293
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,963
She says, "I have to go home.

294
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:34,336
There's no other way.
You think I can fly?"

295
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:40,406
But there is no problems.
I mean, she walks behind cows, see?

296
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:42,941
Do you understand? Mines!

297
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,844
Yeah. She follows the cows.

298
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:49,948
- Get out of there. It's dangerous!
- Smart.

299
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:52,684
"International humanitarian
law as established

300
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,654
"by the Geneva convention prohibits...

301
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:57,356
"article 55,

302
00:24:57,656 --> 00:25:02,428
"using environmental modification
techniques with hostile aims

303
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:06,970
"in order to protect the health
of the population during wartime."

304
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:11,403
I appreciate the reminder, Ms. Richard,

305
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,490
but that article, as you correctly stated

306
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,026
refers only to international
armed conflicts.

307
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,378
Well, that's true, sir,

308
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,517
but neither of us has a Bosnian accent.

309
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:27,853
Our passports do not make this an
international conflict despite your insistence.

310
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:30,355
Your request is duly noted

311
00:25:30,455 --> 00:25:35,931
but leave it to the military
to establish priorities during wartime.

312
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:41,700
As for the rest... the curfew will remain
in effect throughout the area.

313
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,869
All circulation is prohibited between...

314
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:47,977
- You're not gonna say anything?
- Let it go. They are in charge.

315
00:25:57,365 --> 00:25:59,938
Sir, he's mined.

316
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,990
The corpse.

317
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,960
My colleague has reminded me
it might be...

318
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,063
It's not unusual.
They do it sometimes, as you know.

319
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:14,800
- So we won't touch it.
- Have you handled the body?

320
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,970
No, mining protocol
prohibits from doing so, sir.

321
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,709
That's your jurisdiction.

322
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:29,542
[Take her to the base.]

323
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:32,309
[Don't complicate it even more.]

324
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:37,291
[- I have enough problems.
- Problems. What problems are those?]

325
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,876
[For example, the nag
you saw in the meeting.]

326
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,095
Sophie!

327
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:46,435
- Fighting the UN is not gonna help.
- Yeah, but they won't listen to me!

328
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,351
[See?]

329
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:52,774
[- Was it her first death?]
- Yep.

330
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:58,937
[Goyo, if Sarah finds out Katya's here...]

331
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:00,604
[Holy shit!]

332
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,884
[She's far away. Who's going to tell her?]

333
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,251
[Katya.]

334
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:08,301
[All your problems have to do with women.]

335
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:13,662
[I have another little problem.]
Nikola! Come here!

336
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:17,229
This is Goyo, <i>my boss.</i>

337
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:20,068
- Shake hands.
- Hello.

338
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,684
Ball?

339
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:25,103
[See? Every man for himself.]

340
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,639
- No ball?
- Sorry, Nikola, no ball.

341
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:30,075
The Spanish battalion
is 40 kilometers away.

342
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:32,010
They might have rope there.

343
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,580
Goyo, your escort request.

344
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,583
Were not going anywhere.
We're going back to the base.

345
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:40,619
- What about the fat guy?
- Fat guy stays, we leave.

346
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:43,355
- But there will be an epidemic.
- Maybe.

347
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:46,290
But with any luck, I'll be gone by then.

348
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,492
Okay, beautiful.

349
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:51,196
Not our problem anymore.
They said not to touch it.

350
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,632
Tell your assistant
to take it easy, Mambru.

351
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:57,169
I'm not his assistant. We work together.

352
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:59,938
Maybe you shouldn't
have said he was mined.

353
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,641
Besides we have to take
the new girl to the base.

354
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:05,477
Go ahead and tell B we're gonna
drop the kid off at the well.

355
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:09,017
He should meet us there. Go ahead.

356
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:14,126
[You'll miss all this.]

357
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:25,731
This your girlfriend?

358
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,533
What? Don't joke like that.

359
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,172
Come on, get in the car.

360
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:47,152
You know you can't transport civilians
in a conflict area, right?

361
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:51,361
We're not transporting him.
We're keeping him out of trouble.

362
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:57,065
Sure. Some things never change.

363
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,098
It hasn't been that long.

364
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:03,503
Oh, it hasn't? How long?

365
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:08,173
- Two years?
- One and a half.

366
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:10,111
Well...

367
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,348
You look different
from the last time I saw you.

368
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,749
Sure, I'm dressed.

369
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:21,871
That's right. You are dressed. But...

370
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:27,092
- your hair was different.
- My head is what was different.

371
00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:31,165
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2 for Mike 1,
do you copy? Over.</i>

372
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:38,340
<i>Mike 2, Mike 2 for Mike 1,
do you copy? Over.</i>

373
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:41,243
Hi.

374
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,314
Rope. Damir, rope.

375
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:12,837
What's the problem?

376
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,973
There is no rope.

377
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:19,347
What do you mean there's no rope?
There's plenty of rope. I'm touching it.

378
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:26,354
- Please don't touch merchandise, he says.
- Alright.

379
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:31,289
He asked me...

380
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:33,959
why we need the rope for,
so I explained him.

381
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:38,130
And he told me that if somebody
throw man in a well

382
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,667
he probably was no saint
and it's better to leave him there.

383
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:45,406
Never touch dead people, he says.

384
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,065
How much? How much? Money. How much?

385
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:08,593
He says that...

386
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:11,332
they need rope for hangings.

387
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:14,702
He's... he's kidding, right?

388
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,302
I don't know.

389
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:20,575
Sense of humor
is bit different in this area.

390
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:47,768
How are things with Sarah, Mambru?

391
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,036
Fine.

392
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:53,238
We ran into each other. Did she tell you?

393
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,909
- No.
- Incredible, isn't it?

394
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:01,866
- After everything that happened.
- Incredible.

395
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,485
In a showroom, furniture.
She was looking at bedrooms.

396
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:09,290
- She said you were moving.
- Yeah?

397
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:14,794
- She was having doubts.
- She was having doubts about what?

398
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:20,416
Between the two colors, salmon or beige.
Which one did she finally pick?

399
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:24,836
No idea. She handles that part,
the color part.

400
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:28,974
But I am there if she needs my opinion,
of course... to support her.

401
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:32,714
That's what couples are all about, right?

402
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:34,749
Support.

403
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,452
Of course.

404
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:42,053
I was actually looking at bedrooms too.
Can you believe it?

405
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:46,327
- You?
- Yeah, with Bernal.

406
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,008
So you and Bernal are back together?

407
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:53,318
Looks like it.

408
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,935
What color did you pick?

409
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,924
Salmon.

410
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,583
Difficult to know. Many problems here.

411
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:16,154
Maybe they're enemies and they don't
want you to remove body from well.

412
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:19,947
- Or maybe they put it there.
- You think?

413
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:22,594
Could be.
You know, things are complicated.

414
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:26,634
Whatever you think... it's possible here.

415
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:30,268
Or maybe you are foreigner

416
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,771
and that's why they don't sell you rope.

417
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:36,375
Many people hate foreigners
because they come with war.

418
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:38,927
You remind them
that everything is bad here.

419
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:43,935
You know, the bombs, the deaths
and so they hate you for that.

420
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,691
What's that sign saying?

421
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:55,396
"UN convoy, stay...

422
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:00,769
back."

423
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:05,373
You see the size of that escort?
Military target.

424
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,449
They're taking meat to the refugees.

425
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:20,118
You might as well paint
a bull's eye on your chest.

426
00:34:20,218 --> 00:34:24,443
The further away you get from these guys,
the better. You get what I'm saying?

427
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:29,063
What's that?

428
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:40,876
I told her I was coming.

429
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,843
You told Sarah
we were gonna see each other?

430
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:47,409
Yeah, because of the evaluation.

431
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:52,149
- You're not mad, are you?
- About which part?

432
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:56,557
- What evaluation?
- Yeah. What evaluation?

433
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,967
We need to check if the mission still
makes sense. If the cost is justified.

434
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:04,829
- And that's up to you?
- We don't have unlimited resources, Mambru.

435
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:07,132
Never mind your report.

436
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:09,401
Tell them we can't leave.

437
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:12,137
- But you're leaving next week.
- So what?

438
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,973
Me leaving is one thing,
all of us leaving is another.

439
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:17,659
This is almost over, Mambru.
Peace is coming.

440
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:20,898
- Don't you watch the news?
- I don't.

441
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,318
I'm too busy pulling bodies out of wells.

442
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:28,656
But peace may come,
the problems don't disappear.

443
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:32,059
This is gonna be
an emergency zone for a long while.

444
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,384
[What's this?]

445
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:07,495
- What are you doing?
- $6 each.

446
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:20,642
You know they need water.

447
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:25,780
You understand? It's not... it's not fair.

448
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:32,853
You know they need water?

449
00:36:34,052 --> 00:36:35,887
Sophie.

450
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:39,694
- Sophie. Sophie!
- You know it's not fair.

451
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:49,971
They're taking advantage of them.

452
00:36:50,951 --> 00:36:54,158
Of course, they are. This is war.

453
00:36:55,706 --> 00:36:58,246
Come on, let's get back to the car.

454
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,819
What bastards. $6 for water
and that's how we help people.

455
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:11,856
We can't get the body out. We got no rope.

456
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,960
- You don't have any rope?
- It broke.

457
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,996
We have to do what we have to do.
Get the body out and clean the water.

458
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:21,341
- Sophie, we're not allowed to touch it.
- Yeah, what's wrong with you?

459
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,469
Weren't you in the room? Mambru is right.
He's doing what he was told.

460
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:28,006
Please don't agree with me.

461
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:29,941
Tough shit. If you're right, you're right.

462
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,147
They give you an order,
you follow it. Period.

463
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:59,841
Let me do the talking.
Don't say a word. You'll see.

464
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,422
This is storage? Supplies?

465
00:38:17,522 --> 00:38:19,240
Storage, yes.

466
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,527
We are Pomoc. Aid workers.

467
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:27,532
We have a problem.
Big problem. We need a rope.

468
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,971
Do you have any rope?

469
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:34,041
Rope, like...

470
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:42,380
There's a... there is a...
there is a corpse.

471
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,217
A corpse. Dead fucker in a well.

472
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:50,322
And we need to get it out.
So we need rope.

473
00:38:50,722 --> 00:38:55,126
So the people could drink the water.
You understand?

474
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,465
Water.

475
00:38:58,395 --> 00:39:01,366
No water here. War, sorry.

476
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,435
No... no. We don't need no water.

477
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:06,070
- Only... what's rope?
- Konapac.

478
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,139
Kono... konopac, no water.

479
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,642
No water, no konopac.

480
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:13,748
No nothing. War, sorry.

481
00:39:19,048 --> 00:39:21,422
- Should I?
- Yeah.

482
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:37,501
Hey, hey!

483
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:39,540
Konopac.

484
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:45,209
- You lend me this one. Two hours.
- No, no, no. Not possible.

485
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,025
- Not possible.
- Not the flag. Just the rope.

486
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:53,718
It's my... country.
You take rope. Flag down.

487
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:56,621
This is war. Flag down, not possible.

488
00:39:56,721 --> 00:40:00,258
We know, we know, we know this is war.
We only want the rope.

489
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,994
Flag down, we surrender.

490
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:07,098
Me, kaput. They... me.

491
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:08,833
Understand?

492
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:12,070
This is war. Flag down, not possible.

493
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,242
You gotta make a choice, flag or water?

494
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,351
<i>Mike 1, Mike 1, this is Mike 2. Copy?</i>

495
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:29,924
Mike 2, this is Mike 1.
How did it go over there? Over.

496
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:35,696
Not good. There was rope.
But there's no rope.

497
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,331
<i>I didn't copy that.
Can you give that to me again? Over.</i>

498
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:43,070
No rope, no rope.

499
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,773
Shit.

500
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:50,210
<i>Okay, we'll wait for you here.
Over and out.</i>

501
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:58,986
Maybe they throw man in the well
so they can sell water.

502
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:07,394
Maybe.

503
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,224
You need rope?

504
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:42,763
- Yeah.
- I know where you find.

505
00:41:44,527 --> 00:41:47,098
Oh, yeah? Where?

506
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:51,038
In my house. Not far. I'll take you.

507
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:57,545
And how long is this rope?

508
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,081
Long.

509
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,385
Show me.

510
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:32,777
<i>Yeah, there was a change of plans.
We're heading over to Dukovo.</i>

511
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:35,921
- Apparently there's rope there.
- <i>Who says?</i>

512
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,784
Rope?

513
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:40,751
Local sources. Over and out.

514
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,787
Aren't we going back to the base?

515
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:46,190
Yeah, but first we're gonna
get our friend out of the well.

516
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,226
- You're not allowed.
- Says who?

517
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:50,561
The United Nations.
They said you can't do it.

518
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:54,265
I don't take orders from them.
I'm not wearing a helmet.

519
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:56,767
It was just explained
to you by an official.

520
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:59,104
Who do we need to get for you
to understand? Butros Ghali?

521
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,873
Yeah. Butros Butros-Ghali.

522
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:05,476
I want him to come here and explain to me
why the hell we can't get the body

523
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:08,383
- out of that well.
- I can't talk to you.

524
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,829
I'm never gonna make my meeting.

525
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:28,800
You know it's a good thing you're getting
to see what's going on here first hand.

526
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,203
It's just gonna help your report.

527
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:33,804
Don't make this personal.
I was sent by headquarters.

528
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:36,207
It's always personal.

529
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:40,643
<i>Mambru, you got 2 people in the back seat.
Are you aware of that?</i>

530
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:10,845
- Nikola, left or right?
- Right.

531
00:44:11,408 --> 00:44:13,180
Right.

532
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:44,778
No rope around here.

533
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:50,484
<i>Maybe there was a store before.</i>

534
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:57,524
Maybe they made rope here.

535
00:44:58,588 --> 00:45:00,923
There was a factory.

536
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:05,332
<i>This could have been the center
of the entire Balkan rope industry.</i>

537
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,766
<i>Everybody in the village made rope.</i>

538
00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:12,870
Every year they'd split the surplus
at the rope festival.

539
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:16,006
<i>People come from all over
the country to celebrate.</i>

540
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:17,779
<i>Singing, dancing.</i>

541
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:21,662
At weddings, newlyweds
would give each other rope...

542
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:24,649
<i>and tie themselves together
as a symbol of their union.</i>

543
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:26,817
- Who is this guy?
- <i>Offerings were made...</i>

544
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:30,087
He's part of our... integration program.

545
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:33,927
<i>There were miracles.
Rope appeared out of nowhere.</i>

546
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:39,130
<i>Welcome to Konopac,
the rope capital of the world.</i>

547
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,465
<i>Population, 5.</i>

548
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:44,235
<i>I'm B, I'll be your tour guide
for this afternoon</i>

549
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:47,808
<i>and I'm pleased to be with y'all
on this lovely day.</i>

550
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,789
No, no, no.

551
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:05,492
Stay with Sophie, stay with Sophie.

552
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:15,135
That's the kid's house. He says
there's a big chunk of rope in there.

553
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,338
Shit! Where d'you get her?

554
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:22,843
Models without borders?

555
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,810
- Hi, I'm Katya.
- That's Katya.

556
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,146
Ka... Katya? The Katya? Katya, Katya...

557
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:30,878
- Yeah.
- What's she doing here?

558
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:33,254
- Is she here to see you?
- Can't get enough...

559
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:43,661
Wait, wait.

560
00:46:43,811 --> 00:46:45,550
It's tied up.

561
00:46:48,965 --> 00:46:51,605
Nikola, stop.

562
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:58,012
Rope.

563
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,915
That's the rope?

564
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,484
- Our rope?
- Nikola no lie.

565
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:09,687
Nikola no lie, but Nikola no say
the rope was tied to a dog either.

566
00:47:09,787 --> 00:47:12,456
I say I take you to rope
and rope is there.

567
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:16,564
Kid is right. The rope is there.
And it's perfect.

568
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:21,132
It's not perfect. Perfect would be
if there was no dog on one end.

569
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:24,635
Rope is there.
Dog is your problem, not Nikola's.

570
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:26,604
Nikola little boy.

571
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:29,039
Nikola little boy.

572
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:32,777
You come here to help, no? Now you help.

573
00:47:32,877 --> 00:47:36,798
You heard him, Mambru. It's your turn.
You're the safety expert here.

574
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:39,640
- Exactly.
- We need the rope.

575
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,587
Thank you, Sophie. I know we need
the rope, but we need our hands too.

576
00:47:43,687 --> 00:47:48,125
- You want the kid to get it?
- Great idea, Katya. Great idea.

577
00:47:48,425 --> 00:47:51,295
Don't we have anything we can give him?

578
00:47:51,395 --> 00:47:54,031
Valium? Percocet?

579
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:56,470
I'll check.

580
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,542
Nikola!

581
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,412
Where are you going?

582
00:48:07,577 --> 00:48:09,146
Inside.

583
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:13,821
You can't go inside.
It's not safe, come on!

584
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:18,292
I need my ball.

585
00:48:25,128 --> 00:48:27,568
You see the roof?

586
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:30,571
It's falling. It's too dangerous.

587
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:37,742
How about we get the rope...

588
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:41,979
and then I go inside and get ball?

589
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,451
Okay.

590
00:48:44,347 --> 00:48:46,687
Let's go help Sophie.

591
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:50,554
- He brought you to his house.
- He said there was rope here.

592
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:53,190
- There is.
- He said?

593
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,659
I don't understand,
who's in charge here? The kid?

594
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:58,762
Well, sometimes we get information
from local people.

595
00:48:58,862 --> 00:49:00,965
Local people?

596
00:49:01,065 --> 00:49:02,767
You mean local kids?

597
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:05,803
Good doggie. Oh, yeah.

598
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:07,907
Good doggie.

599
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:12,646
- Good doggie.
- That should be enough.

600
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:24,374
- Careful, Damir.
- Don't worry.

601
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,629
Tajsone.

602
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,517
Tajsone.

603
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:37,101
Tajsone crazy dog.

604
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:39,937
One day, he bite my father.

605
00:49:40,037 --> 00:49:42,373
But my father more crazy than Tajsone.

606
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:47,478
He bite Tajsone back and since then
Tajsone respect him.

607
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:49,480
So your dad... bit the dog?

608
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,049
Everybody to hospital that night.

609
00:49:52,149 --> 00:49:53,918
Dog too.

610
00:49:54,018 --> 00:49:55,486
He says...

611
00:49:55,586 --> 00:49:58,689
"what you do to me I do to you."

612
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:01,125
And Tajsone never bite him again.

613
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:03,063
Sure.

614
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:09,670
Where are they now? Your mum and your dad?

615
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:14,738
They afraid something bad
happen to us here.

616
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:19,315
So they leave me with my grandfather
and they go in Donovich.

617
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:24,348
But he says they will come back
when war is over.

618
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:26,520
Oh, sure.

619
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,273
I'm sure.

620
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:36,463
He's even more awake now
than he was before.

621
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:39,163
This won't be easy.

622
00:50:39,263 --> 00:50:41,699
He survived the war.

623
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:43,634
Nikola.

624
00:50:43,734 --> 00:50:46,707
If your ball is in house, where is?

625
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:50,007
- In garage.
- Garage?

626
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:52,179
Vámonos, Sophie.

627
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:38,715
Okay, let me go first.

628
00:52:38,815 --> 00:52:41,254
Stay right behind me.

629
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:45,819
Oh, boy.

630
00:53:56,893 --> 00:53:58,429
Where is the roof?

631
00:53:58,729 --> 00:54:01,068
Out there somewhere.

632
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,634
They blew it off
from right there, you see?

633
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,773
They leave an open tank of butane...

634
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:12,176
they light a fuse...

635
00:54:12,276 --> 00:54:14,948
close the windows, shut the door.

636
00:54:15,678 --> 00:54:17,919
Half an hour later...

637
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:20,587
roof is gone.

638
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:23,153
Who?

639
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:25,792
Neighbors, probably.

640
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:31,428
But before the war

641
00:54:31,528 --> 00:54:34,534
if you were a Muslim
and your husband a Serb...

642
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:38,916
or the other way around
it was no big deal.

643
00:54:42,805 --> 00:54:45,008
Then the war starts...

644
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:47,547
the lines are drawn.

645
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:52,218
And now it's too dangerous to stay here.

646
00:54:54,016 --> 00:54:55,755
So...

647
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:59,426
you leave the kids
with their grandparents...

648
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:03,093
and you go to the other side...

649
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:05,532
where it's safer.

650
00:55:08,664 --> 00:55:12,005
But while you're away...

651
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:18,224
the neighbors blow up your house
so you won't come back after the war.

652
00:55:18,324 --> 00:55:20,664
Hey, it could be worse.

653
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:23,046
What could be worse?

654
00:55:23,146 --> 00:55:26,652
Putting a mine in the sofa
in case you do come back.

655
00:55:29,685 --> 00:55:31,925
Let's move.

656
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,962
No.

657
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,761
Mambru?

658
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:11,161
I got it.

659
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:13,698
He's gonna be a happy kid.

660
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:26,476
Wait! Wait! No!

661
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:28,045
- Sorry.
- Sophie, don't.

662
00:56:28,145 --> 00:56:30,484
I'm so sorry.

663
00:56:34,718 --> 00:56:36,957
Wait, Sophie.

664
00:56:37,954 --> 00:56:39,890
Don't turn around.

665
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,725
- What?
- Look at me.

666
00:56:42,825 --> 00:56:44,828
Look at me.

667
00:56:44,928 --> 00:56:47,133
Don't turn around.

668
00:56:48,064 --> 00:56:50,033
- It's okay.
- What...

669
00:56:50,133 --> 00:56:52,335
Look at me. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

670
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:55,108
Come here... Don't! Don't! Don't!

671
00:57:15,158 --> 00:57:17,127
Nikola.

672
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:21,050
Here's the ball. Mambru needs you inside.

673
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,990
Long enough.

674
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:46,727
Let's do it.

675
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,872
There are soldiers.

676
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:10,073
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

677
00:59:10,173 --> 00:59:12,812
Welcome to the Balkans!

678
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:20,450
Hotel, Hotel.
This is Mike 1, come in. Over.

679
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,452
<i>Mike 1, this is Hotel, come in.</i>

680
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:25,822
Hey.

681
00:59:25,922 --> 00:59:29,627
Tell them not to wash the car.
We don't have any money.

682
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:31,394
They don't wanna wash the car.

683
00:59:31,494 --> 00:59:35,268
I know they don't wanna wash the car.
It's a joke. Tell them.

684
00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:43,877
Tell them.

685
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:09,566
We've been stopped
at a local military checkpoint

686
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,936
on the road to Bjelane about
30 kilometers east, sector 6.

687
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:16,273
- What's going on?
- We are 6 people. 4 expats.

688
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:20,556
Yeah, yeah. What the hell was that?
Ask them what the problem is.

689
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:30,287
He says the road is closed.
We have to go back.

690
01:00:30,387 --> 01:00:32,191
Why?

691
01:00:34,823 --> 01:00:38,762
He says... because we can't go through.

692
01:00:38,862 --> 01:00:41,251
That explains everything.

693
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:45,538
<i>The road is closed.</i>

694
01:00:49,988 --> 01:00:52,174
Johnny Cash?

695
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,444
<i>Yeah, I think it's something else.</i>

696
01:00:54,544 --> 01:00:55,979
I'm walking over.

697
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,349
- Can they stop us?
- Looks like it.

698
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:03,520
According to the peace agreements, these
guys should have been demobilized by now.

699
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,622
Oh, you wanna go and tell them?

700
01:01:05,722 --> 01:01:07,224
Fine.

701
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:09,529
Hey.

702
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:17,934
Okay. Sophie, get behind the wheel.

703
01:01:18,034 --> 01:01:22,582
If I put my hands like this turn the car
around and get the hell out of here.

704
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,821
What's the problem?
Why can't we go through?

705
01:01:37,853 --> 01:01:40,627
Tell him we need to go through.
We have to reach the base.

706
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:45,095
- You can't.
- Sorry, madam. This is a war.

707
01:01:45,195 --> 01:01:49,266
No, this is not. War is over.
There are peace talks underway.

708
01:01:49,366 --> 01:01:53,072
Cessation of hostilities.
Do you understand?

709
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:58,644
You haven't been informed.

710
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,781
Who's your commanding officer?

711
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:08,885
- Are those prisoners right behind me?
- Yeah.

712
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:13,393
- Do we know what they're doing with them?
- I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.

713
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,532
Excuse me...

714
01:02:22,232 --> 01:02:25,802
Can you tell them...
if they need a hand with anything

715
01:02:25,902 --> 01:02:28,441
we are willing to help?

716
01:02:39,982 --> 01:02:41,484
What did he say?

717
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:45,001
Nothing. He says... we have to go.
The road is closed.

718
01:02:46,855 --> 01:02:51,261
Okay. Okay. Ask them
what time do they open the road.

719
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:53,199
I can't.

720
01:02:55,764 --> 01:02:58,704
- Why?
- I can't.

721
01:03:04,473 --> 01:03:08,214
- Why?
- He say that he knows my family in Dabrica.

722
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:15,655
- Do you have family in Dabrica?
- My brother.

723
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:19,789
Okay. I'm sorry.

724
01:03:19,889 --> 01:03:22,341
- Let's go.
- Okay.

725
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:25,681
Okay. We go.

726
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:55,358
<i>We stumbled on to a little situation
on the road to Bjelane.</i>

727
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:59,696
20 prisoners, blue minibus.
Looks like they're up to no good.

728
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:03,633
<i>Inform the blue helmets, tell them to check
it out and make sure everything is kosher.</i>

729
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:07,510
<i>Location 30 kilometers
east of Dukovo. Over.</i>

730
01:04:24,387 --> 01:04:26,626
You know where we are?

731
01:04:27,556 --> 01:04:29,429
I think so.

732
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,503
<i>Mike 2, this is Mike 1. Over.</i>

733
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:14,961
Yeah, go ahead.

734
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:18,408
<i>Yeah. The road isn't here. We should have
seen it 4 kilometers back. Over.</i>

735
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:20,443
That's not good.

736
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:23,849
<i>Let's keep that hill in the sight. Over.</i>

737
01:05:47,035 --> 01:05:48,508
<i>Cow?</i>

738
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:51,744
Cow.

739
01:06:02,718 --> 01:06:04,957
Oh, man!

740
01:06:10,892 --> 01:06:13,032
That's fresh.

741
01:06:20,468 --> 01:06:22,338
Fuck me.

742
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:25,942
What do you think? Go to the left?

743
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:28,645
Or right? Or over it?

744
01:06:28,745 --> 01:06:31,511
This morning we went over one. It worked.

745
01:06:31,611 --> 01:06:33,686
What worked?

746
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:36,152
They always follow a pattern.

747
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:39,388
Maybe the pattern is to change pattern.

748
01:06:39,488 --> 01:06:43,593
And now it's underneath.
That's what I would do if I were them.

749
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:46,529
If you were them, maybe you're thinking
that we know what you're thinking

750
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:49,168
and then you'd go on the side.

751
01:06:50,932 --> 01:06:52,936
It was dragged here.

752
01:06:53,236 --> 01:06:57,240
- Excuse me?
- The cow. It was dragged from here.

753
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,842
You mean it's from somewhere else?

754
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:02,314
Yeah, it was brought here.

755
01:07:02,944 --> 01:07:06,015
- The cow?
- Yeah, the cow, the cow.

756
01:07:06,115 --> 01:07:09,118
Okay, B, go ahead
and inform on our position.

757
01:07:09,218 --> 01:07:11,220
We're gonna have to spend the night here.

758
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,073
- With the cow?
- With the cow.

759
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:16,793
- You're kidding me, right?
- You're not going to drive over this one?

760
01:07:16,893 --> 01:07:20,196
- No, this is a different breed of cow.
- Isn't there another way?

761
01:07:20,296 --> 01:07:24,701
- Also, it is a possibility it could've died?
- Everybody... everybody, listen up!

762
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:26,769
We're gonna move the cars back 10 meters

763
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:29,906
and nobody strays from the cars
without my permission.

764
01:07:30,006 --> 01:07:31,808
Nikola, the ball stays in the car.

765
01:07:31,908 --> 01:07:34,830
We can't stop like this in the middle
of the night. We have to keep going.

766
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:38,284
I'm already cold! Can we go back
or something and make...

767
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:45,124
Go, get it. If you don't blow up,
we keep driving.

768
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:49,896
Well?

769
01:07:51,793 --> 01:07:54,133
Come on, get in the car.

770
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:01,170
We are in quadrant 3.

771
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:05,642
A country road
about 14 kilometers east of Dukovo.

772
01:08:05,742 --> 01:08:06,909
We are 6 people.

773
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:10,980
4 expats and 2 locals,
the interpreter and a boy.

774
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,519
<i>Do you have enough supplies?</i>

775
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,085
Roger that, Hotel.

776
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:19,055
We have enough water, some sardines

777
01:08:19,155 --> 01:08:22,058
various other NGO tin can delicacies.

778
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,494
We could really use a pizza, however.

779
01:08:24,594 --> 01:08:27,700
Do you happen to know
of a place that delivers? Over.

780
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:30,867
<i>Can you repeat that?</i>

781
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:33,603
I said we have sufficient supplies. Over.

782
01:08:33,703 --> 01:08:35,774
<i>Okay, I'll...</i>

783
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:54,494
How are you doing?

784
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,232
I can't stop thinking about them.

785
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:05,738
The 3 of them.
I imagine them together in that house.

786
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:10,643
Is that normal?

787
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:19,418
Forget them.

788
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:22,087
They're gone.

789
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:29,762
- What are we going to do?
- Nothing.

790
01:09:30,425 --> 01:09:32,665
We keep going.

791
01:09:33,728 --> 01:09:35,768
Don't think about it.

792
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,072
You'll end up going home.

793
01:09:42,404 --> 01:09:46,846
Forget what's happened
or what's gonna happen.

794
01:09:48,376 --> 01:09:50,847
Focus on what's happening now.

795
01:09:50,947 --> 01:09:52,918
Have some.

796
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,890
The rest doesn't exist here.

797
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,926
Maybe back home...

798
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,729
but not here.

799
01:10:04,626 --> 01:10:06,665
Mambru!

800
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:11,838
Your girlfriend called the base!
Apparently it's urgent!

801
01:10:13,368 --> 01:10:15,805
Mambru, did you hear me?

802
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:19,478
- Your girl...
- I heard. I heard.

803
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,054
You have to work on it.

804
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,686
Trust me.

805
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:42,198
Where do you think you are? At a barbecue?

806
01:10:42,298 --> 01:10:46,903
Hotel, this is Mambru.
Did she say why it was urgent? Over.

807
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:50,409
<i>Negative. Just to call her. Over and out.</i>

808
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,180
What's going on, Sarah?

809
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,585
Yes, she is.

810
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,987
What a coincidence?

811
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:07,023
Yeah, she told me
you guys ran into each other.

812
01:11:07,123 --> 01:11:09,362
So what's going on?

813
01:11:13,528 --> 01:11:15,334
Whichever.

814
01:11:16,131 --> 01:11:18,571
I mean, does it matter?

815
01:11:19,367 --> 01:11:21,407
Either one.

816
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:24,310
The second one.

817
01:11:25,173 --> 01:11:26,979
Salmon.

818
01:11:27,976 --> 01:11:32,114
No, it's not that I don't care.
I totally do.

819
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:35,500
I trust you, which is different.

820
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:41,627
Where is Damir's coffee?

821
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,764
Thank you.

822
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:53,638
What about his parents?
Won't they be worried?

823
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:55,504
They won't be worried.

824
01:11:55,604 --> 01:11:58,507
Well, he's just a kid
and you're keeping him all night.

825
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:01,811
He lives in Bjelani with his grandfather.
He says it's no problem...

826
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:04,533
What he said doesn't matter. He's a minor.

827
01:12:06,081 --> 01:12:08,851
What would you say if he were your son?

828
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:12,255
Some people take him
and bring him back the next day.

829
01:12:12,355 --> 01:12:16,343
Well? What would any normal person think?

830
01:12:16,443 --> 01:12:19,495
That there was a problem
at the checkpoint?

831
01:12:19,595 --> 01:12:22,167
I said normal, B, you don't count.

832
01:12:23,081 --> 01:12:25,564
B, did you know that Katya
came all the way here

833
01:12:25,664 --> 01:12:28,170
to close the mission and send us home?

834
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:32,444
- What home?
- Exactly. What home?

835
01:12:32,774 --> 01:12:34,911
That's the problem.

836
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:37,813
A home, B. Normal with walls.

837
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:40,583
That isn't bombed out.
Have you got one of those?

838
01:12:40,683 --> 01:12:43,352
Wife, children, friends.

839
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:46,122
A dog. Someone waiting for you somewhere?

840
01:12:46,222 --> 01:12:48,024
Yeah, I got plenty of people
waiting for me.

841
01:12:48,124 --> 01:12:50,896
Plenty. How many?

842
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,996
Hookers don't count.

843
01:12:54,096 --> 01:12:56,832
- Hookers don't count?
- No, they don't.

844
01:12:56,932 --> 01:12:59,235
I mean, emotional bonds.

845
01:12:59,335 --> 01:13:01,270
Have you got any?

846
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,842
Emotional bonds.

847
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:09,645
I'll have to think about it.

848
01:13:09,745 --> 01:13:13,716
You guys spend so much time around here
you forget what real life is like.

849
01:13:13,816 --> 01:13:16,719
Look, I don't wanna kick you out of here.

850
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:18,754
I just wanna do my job.

851
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:23,116
For that, I have to get to the base.
Is that too much to ask?

852
01:13:25,093 --> 01:13:27,430
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.

853
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,902
What did I say? Nobody strays.

854
01:13:46,549 --> 01:13:49,756
Damir, what are you looking at?

855
01:13:50,086 --> 01:13:52,375
Show some respect for your colleagues.

856
01:14:08,603 --> 01:14:11,310
Internal affairs is moving.

857
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:14,343
You noticed, right?

858
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:17,612
- What?
- Her panties.

859
01:14:17,712 --> 01:14:20,786
- They were black.
- So?

860
01:14:21,116 --> 01:14:26,255
So nobody wears black panties to a war
unless they're expecting something.

861
01:14:26,355 --> 01:14:28,824
Where did you hear that?

862
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:31,961
You gotta bang her. It's no big deal.

863
01:14:32,061 --> 01:14:34,730
She'll soften up a bit,
she writes a favorable report

864
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:37,366
and everybody be happy. Sophie agrees.

865
01:14:37,466 --> 01:14:40,603
- Oh, you two talked about it?
- We don't even need to.

866
01:14:40,703 --> 01:14:44,073
We understand each other without talking.
It's non-verbal communication.

867
01:14:44,173 --> 01:14:46,125
This morning your communication
was pretty verbal.

868
01:14:46,225 --> 01:14:48,436
We're pass that.

869
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:54,592
And I have been tilling the soil for you.

870
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:58,186
- What soil?
- With Katya.

871
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,356
I told her that, you know...

872
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:04,093
from time to time,
you... talk about her...

873
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:06,471
all affectionate.

874
01:15:08,563 --> 01:15:12,101
- That's not true.
- I know it's not true. It's a trick.

875
01:15:12,201 --> 01:15:14,570
We want her happy.

876
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:18,974
Can't you just slip her one? It's not
like I'm asking you to fuck Damir.

877
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:20,844
B...

878
01:15:21,544 --> 01:15:23,958
I have a girlfriend.

879
01:15:25,046 --> 01:15:27,049
- Yeah.
- She's hot.

880
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:30,653
You had a thing with her before.
It's a relapse.

881
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:33,756
It's like smoking again.
It's totally understandable.

882
01:15:33,856 --> 01:15:36,895
She writes a terrible report about us...

883
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:40,362
we gotta go home. What then?

884
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:43,099
Who helps the people then?

885
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:47,036
You even think about that?
No. You're being selfish.

886
01:15:47,136 --> 01:15:51,282
You gotta fuck her...
for the Bosnian people!

887
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:57,021
Make a sacrifice...
for the humanitarian cause.

888
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:00,748
She won't say no.

889
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,694
Hey. Hey.

890
01:16:04,085 --> 01:16:06,097
I'm serious.

891
01:16:38,019 --> 01:16:40,298
Did he fall asleep?

892
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:45,494
He says when he grows up,
he wants to be an aid worker.

893
01:16:45,594 --> 01:16:49,932
Tell him how much we make
he'll change his mind real fast.

894
01:16:50,032 --> 01:16:53,469
Pay no attention. He'll tell the soldiers
he wants to be a soldier.

895
01:16:53,569 --> 01:16:55,437
These journalists,
he wants to be a journalist.

896
01:16:55,537 --> 01:16:58,374
Have you guys seen my notebook
or did you throw that away too, Mambru?

897
01:16:58,474 --> 01:17:00,888
He would tell Katya
he wants to... hey, Katya...

898
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:03,632
What is it that you do now exactly, Katya?

899
01:17:04,045 --> 01:17:07,349
Conflict evaluation and analysis.

900
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:10,219
Forget that. He don't wanna tell
anyone he wants to do that.

901
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:12,797
I don't even know what that is.

902
01:17:14,389 --> 01:17:17,893
Is he hitting on you? Watch out.
He always hits on the new ones.

903
01:17:17,993 --> 01:17:20,996
I know that. We all do.

904
01:17:21,196 --> 01:17:22,364
You all know what?

905
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:25,668
That you always do that. They warn us.

906
01:17:25,768 --> 01:17:28,905
- Was it in your mission briefing?
- Under potential hazards.

907
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:33,342
- Along with mines and drunken soldiers?
- Right above it.

908
01:17:33,442 --> 01:17:35,920
You should read them.

909
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:39,106
I will now.

910
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:45,563
That's me a few years ago.

911
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,558
Does she have a boyfriend?

912
01:17:49,658 --> 01:17:51,293
I don't know.

913
01:17:51,393 --> 01:17:55,006
No, of course not. How convenient.

914
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:59,377
Ask her. Maybe she's got
a photo of him in her wallet.

915
01:18:01,436 --> 01:18:03,372
Have you got one of Sarah's?

916
01:18:03,472 --> 01:18:07,184
- What do you care?
- You didn't before.

917
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:09,921
How do you know?

918
01:18:10,945 --> 01:18:13,941
- You didn't.
- Did you look in my wallet?

919
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:17,688
That's not the point right now.
The point is whether or not you had one.

920
01:18:17,788 --> 01:18:21,789
- And you didn't.
- Did you look in my wallet?

921
01:18:21,889 --> 01:18:24,860
So what if I did?
I was looking for something else.

922
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,721
- Like what?
- Your passport. I don't remember.

923
01:18:27,821 --> 01:18:31,300
Unbelievable. You looked in my wallet.

924
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,535
You hid that you had a girlfriend from me.

925
01:18:33,635 --> 01:18:36,947
I never hid anything from you.

926
01:18:38,306 --> 01:18:42,244
It just never came up.
I never said I didn't have a girlfriend.

927
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:45,140
- I talked to you about my boyfriend.
- Non-stop.

928
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,860
- I left him for you.
- Nobody asked you to.

929
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,755
Did I ask you to leave him?

930
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:54,932
Did I?

931
01:18:56,657 --> 01:19:00,195
What's wrong with men?
You know, it's normal.

932
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:04,175
You talk about your girlfriend.
You carry her photo in your wallet.

933
01:19:04,799 --> 01:19:07,603
What are you so ashamed of?
Is it that hard to just admit it?

934
01:19:07,703 --> 01:19:10,172
Okay! I have a girlfriend!

935
01:19:10,272 --> 01:19:13,150
Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

936
01:19:13,658 --> 01:19:15,136
Here.

937
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:21,174
Here is a picture of my girlfriend.

938
01:19:26,037 --> 01:19:28,625
Yeah, I have a girlfriend.

939
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:34,972
Here.

940
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:38,834
Go ahead and tell the world
I have a girlfriend.

941
01:19:38,934 --> 01:19:41,437
Who wants to see
a picture of my girlfriend?

942
01:19:41,537 --> 01:19:44,640
- Is she naked?
- No, she's not naked.

943
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,609
Normal people don't carry
naked photos of their girlfriend.

944
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:49,920
Damir does.

945
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:53,792
- You looked in my wallet?
- I was looking for your passport.

946
01:19:58,786 --> 01:20:01,432
Can't see her very well. It's blurry.

947
01:20:02,056 --> 01:20:04,593
You can see her just fine.

948
01:20:04,693 --> 01:20:08,880
What? You want me to carry
around a poster of her?

949
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:13,044
You tricked me, Mambru and I believed you.

950
01:20:19,173 --> 01:20:21,902
It wouldn't have made any difference.

951
01:20:23,544 --> 01:20:26,214
You think I lied to you...

952
01:20:26,314 --> 01:20:28,592
but I didn't.

953
01:20:29,917 --> 01:20:31,795
Here.

954
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,939
It was nobody's fault.

955
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:47,211
Our relationship... had a blind spot.

956
01:20:47,768 --> 01:20:49,738
Yeah, like a car.

957
01:20:49,838 --> 01:20:52,241
Something we couldn't see, that's all.

958
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:54,460
You mean... your wife?

959
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,784
- Don't call my wife a blind spot.
- I didn't, you did.

960
01:20:57,884 --> 01:21:00,148
I didn't mean her.
I was just giving an example.

961
01:21:00,248 --> 01:21:04,039
Besides she's not my wife.
We're not married.

962
01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:05,908
See? You're denying here again.

963
01:21:06,008 --> 01:21:10,161
Please, can you guys go somewhere else?
I'm trying to go to sleep here.

964
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:16,932
No, we can't!

965
01:21:17,032 --> 01:21:19,510
There are mines!

966
01:21:57,472 --> 01:22:01,252
What? What? What? What? What the fuck?

967
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:07,892
- Oh, my God. Jesus.
- Oh, shit, you scared me.

968
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,028
Mambru, wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

969
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:15,532
<i>Mambru, follow the granny.</i>

970
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:19,865
<i>Follow the granny.
Trust me, follow the granny.</i>

971
01:22:19,965 --> 01:22:22,597
10-4, B. 10-4.

972
01:22:22,697 --> 01:22:24,976
It's just a cow.

973
01:22:27,102 --> 01:22:28,950
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

974
01:22:43,618 --> 01:22:45,850
Not too close, not too close.

975
01:22:53,996 --> 01:22:55,507
Okay.

976
01:23:05,307 --> 01:23:07,009
Just don't look.

977
01:23:07,109 --> 01:23:08,969
Don't look.

978
01:23:28,664 --> 01:23:31,476
<i>I was right. It was left!</i>

979
01:24:17,912 --> 01:24:19,724
It's my grandfather.

980
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:25,996
B, tell Damir to get over here.

981
01:24:46,974 --> 01:24:49,344
Oprostite. Excuse me.

982
01:24:49,444 --> 01:24:51,580
It's our fault.

983
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:54,761
Tell him the road was closed.

984
01:24:55,317 --> 01:24:57,924
We couldn't make it back last night.

985
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:00,531
And Nikola behaved very well.

986
01:25:06,628 --> 01:25:10,741
Tell him... that Nikola took us
to his house in Dukovo.

987
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:24,471
He asks if boy went into the house.

988
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:28,776
No, he didn't. I did.

989
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,803
Nikola.

990
01:25:55,342 --> 01:25:58,789
Ask him if he knows
what happened to his parents.

991
01:26:08,022 --> 01:26:10,100
He knows.

992
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,839
When he will tell him?

993
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:21,178
When war stops.

994
01:26:22,603 --> 01:26:24,981
When time comes.

995
01:26:54,435 --> 01:26:57,581
Let's go, let's go.
Let's free some space here.

996
01:26:58,523 --> 01:27:00,501
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

997
01:27:13,654 --> 01:27:16,132
Make sure you send a postcard.

998
01:27:19,226 --> 01:27:21,638
Oh, yeah.

999
01:27:22,496 --> 01:27:24,132
Here we are.

1000
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:26,802
The war plumbers.

1001
01:27:26,902 --> 01:27:29,337
Unclogging pipes.

1002
01:27:29,437 --> 01:27:33,074
You know, maybe I should be
moving along somewhere.

1003
01:27:33,174 --> 01:27:36,244
Maybe Katya was right.
I should find a wife

1004
01:27:36,344 --> 01:27:38,647
and have two and a half kids.

1005
01:27:38,747 --> 01:27:41,317
- Settle down.
- Fuck all that.

1006
01:27:42,217 --> 01:27:45,394
This is your home. I mean...

1007
01:27:45,754 --> 01:27:49,790
or wherever, people need your help, B.

1008
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,094
That's your family.

1009
01:27:52,194 --> 01:27:54,663
The family that waits for you.

1010
01:27:55,163 --> 01:27:57,199
Misses you.

1011
01:27:57,299 --> 01:28:00,102
How many people can say...

1012
01:28:00,202 --> 01:28:03,839
they are missed by people
they've never met before?

1013
01:28:04,339 --> 01:28:06,040
Not many.

1014
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,919
Not many.

1015
01:28:15,349 --> 01:28:17,252
Okay.

1016
01:28:17,352 --> 01:28:20,397
- Pull.
- Slowly.

1017
01:28:35,514 --> 01:28:37,581
Come on up, Romeo.

1018
01:28:53,072 --> 01:28:56,216
What? Sophie!

1019
01:28:57,908 --> 01:28:59,567
Sophie!

1020
01:29:02,096 --> 01:29:04,308
What's going on?

1021
01:29:34,093 --> 01:29:35,897
What's the problem?

1022
01:29:35,997 --> 01:29:38,400
Are you in charge here?

1023
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,734
Yes, I am.

1024
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:44,672
Yeah, I have a request
from... Ri... Richa... Richardson?

1025
01:29:44,772 --> 01:29:47,542
- It's Richard.
- Oh, yes. Sophie Richard.

1026
01:29:47,642 --> 01:29:52,881
It says, "inspection request...
explosives."

1027
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:55,650
You must abandon the extraction
of that corpse immediately.

1028
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:58,829
- It could be mined.
- But it's not.

1029
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,632
- May I?
- Sure.

1030
01:30:03,824 --> 01:30:05,927
That's a mistake.

1031
01:30:06,027 --> 01:30:08,129
We've searched that well inside out.

1032
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:10,965
There are no explosives in there.
It's all clear.

1033
01:30:11,065 --> 01:30:14,302
Well, you may not be aware of it, sir,
but this is a red zone.

1034
01:30:14,402 --> 01:30:16,371
There's been some changes of jurisdiction

1035
01:30:16,471 --> 01:30:19,407
and we handed everything over
to the local authorities.

1036
01:30:19,507 --> 01:30:22,568
So mined or not,
removing that dead body is illegal.

1037
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:26,181
- I can't believe this.
- But it's a basic sanitary service.

1038
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:29,351
I mean, with all due respect, sir,
it wouldn't matter if it were a pig.

1039
01:30:29,451 --> 01:30:33,154
Abandon the extraction immediately. You need
a judge present to do what you're doing.

1040
01:30:33,254 --> 01:30:35,590
- A judge?
- Yes, a judge.

1041
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:39,594
The area is now under civil jurisdiction.
It's all here in the peace agreements.

1042
01:30:39,694 --> 01:30:42,897
- We must all respect procedure.
- Where the hell are we gonna find a judge?

1043
01:30:42,997 --> 01:30:47,665
We will provide a judge. Just notify
the local authorities. Respect protocol.

1044
01:30:47,765 --> 01:30:49,904
It's not your responsibility
to solve everything.

1045
01:30:50,004 --> 01:30:52,407
Can't you make an exception?
The people here need water.

1046
01:30:52,507 --> 01:30:55,266
Just abandon the extraction
from my request. Let us do our job.

1047
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:59,214
- You might be generating a conflict.
- But there already is a conflict here.

1048
01:30:59,314 --> 01:31:03,351
If we do not clean the water, we won't
need 1 judge we'll need 20 judges.

1049
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:05,053
We cannot make any exceptions, ma'am.

1050
01:31:05,153 --> 01:31:06,821
It's all written in the peace agreements

1051
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:09,958
and it must be respected
by all parties in conflict.

1052
01:31:10,058 --> 01:31:13,837
It's very simple.
You cannot touch dead bodies.

1053
01:31:30,244 --> 01:31:33,648
Give me that rope. That's our rope.

1054
01:31:33,748 --> 01:31:36,960
Give it to me! Don't take it.

1055
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:41,489
You do nothing here!
United nothing! You're nothing!

1056
01:31:41,589 --> 01:31:45,026
I understand your reasoning
but there's nothing else we can do.

1057
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:47,929
We understand that your work
is very important here.

1058
01:31:48,029 --> 01:31:50,465
Remember, we are on the same side.

1059
01:31:50,565 --> 01:31:52,923
Stay out of trouble.

1060
01:32:18,392 --> 01:32:20,403
I'm sorry.

1061
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,620
Excuse me!

1062
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,658
Excuse me.

1063
01:33:14,701 --> 01:33:16,764
Excuse me.

1064
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,429
May I see the ball?

1065
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:25,368
Is that the ball?

1066
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:28,163
Let me see the ball. Let me see...

1067
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:38,515
What's he doing?

1068
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:42,243
No, I just wanna see the ball.

1069
01:33:42,343 --> 01:33:44,821
No, no, no, no.

1070
01:33:52,716 --> 01:33:54,426
This is not your ball!

1071
01:34:05,332 --> 01:34:07,611
Get out of my face!

1072
01:34:11,305 --> 01:34:15,758
He says... Nikola sold it to them for $10.

1073
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:22,717
Bullshit.

1074
01:34:22,817 --> 01:34:24,661
Bullshit.

1075
01:34:29,589 --> 01:34:32,958
Hey, Nikola! Did you sell the ball?

1076
01:34:35,662 --> 01:34:37,541
Yeah?

1077
01:35:16,703 --> 01:35:18,939
Does it hurt?

1078
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:21,284
Nope.

1079
01:35:28,448 --> 01:35:30,827
I thought you wanted that ball.

1080
01:35:32,385 --> 01:35:34,597
I need money.

1081
01:35:35,622 --> 01:35:37,458
What for?

1082
01:35:37,558 --> 01:35:40,837
To go and see my parents in Donovich.

1083
01:35:44,564 --> 01:35:46,534
I have a friend.

1084
01:35:46,634 --> 01:35:49,404
I pay, he takes me where they are.

1085
01:35:49,704 --> 01:35:53,283
I have $40, only need 10 more.

1086
01:35:56,176 --> 01:35:58,112
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

1087
01:35:58,212 --> 01:36:01,304
He has brother at checkpoint.
You pay, you go.

1088
01:36:01,404 --> 01:36:04,218
You can't. It's too dangerous.

1089
01:36:04,318 --> 01:36:07,998
Not dangerous.
You pay, all is possible here.

1090
01:36:09,656 --> 01:36:12,035
You can't do that.

1091
01:36:47,761 --> 01:36:49,706
Here's a $100.

1092
01:36:51,831 --> 01:36:56,449
On one condition.
You take your grandfather on this trip.

1093
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:05,747
Now put it in your pocket.

1094
01:37:05,847 --> 01:37:08,125
Put it in your pocket.

1095
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:24,634
Fat fucker.

1096
01:37:40,513 --> 01:37:44,360
<i>Mike 1, Mike 1. Hotel here.
Come in, please.</i>

1097
01:37:45,685 --> 01:37:48,256
<i>This is Mike 1, come in. Over.</i>

1098
01:37:48,356 --> 01:37:52,393
<i>We have a problem, Mambru,
in Karaula at the refugee camp.</i>

1099
01:37:52,493 --> 01:37:56,743
<i>The latrines are flooded,
somebody should go check it out. Over.</i>

1100
01:37:59,933 --> 01:38:02,437
Should we go straight there? Over.

1101
01:38:02,537 --> 01:38:06,307
<i>I think you'd better.
There are 8000 refugees there.</i>

1102
01:38:06,407 --> 01:38:09,519
<i>That's a lot of latrines. Over.</i>

1103
01:38:09,976 --> 01:38:13,257
Okay, we're on our way. Over and out.

1104
01:38:18,652 --> 01:38:20,154
I'm sorry.

1105
01:38:20,954 --> 01:38:22,957
No problem.

1106
01:38:23,057 --> 01:38:26,873
I'm curious to see if you guys
actually fix something here.

1107
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:34,395
<i>That camp was built in a big hurry.
They got the drainage wrong there.</i>

1108
01:38:34,735 --> 01:38:37,572
The ditches must have collapsed
and all the waste overflows

1109
01:38:37,672 --> 01:38:40,908
<i>so we're probably looking
at a swimming pool of shit.</i>

1110
01:38:41,008 --> 01:38:45,145
<i>That'll make the well
look like a mountain spring.</i>

1111
01:38:45,245 --> 01:38:47,415
- A perfect day.
- Yeah.

1112
01:38:47,515 --> 01:38:50,384
Hey, your first flooded latrines
are important too, Sophie.

1113
01:38:50,484 --> 01:38:52,962
You never forget them either.

1114
01:38:56,122 --> 01:38:59,525
- Is it gonna be rough?
- <i>Nah, we'll be fine...</i>

1115
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:02,237
as long as it doesn't rain.
