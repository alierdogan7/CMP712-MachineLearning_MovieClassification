00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,133
In the Autumn of 1941 ,

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,197
the Nazis were about to embark on the most
cruciaI few months in the pIanning

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:14,404
of what they caIIed `The FinaI SoIution`
- the extermination of the Jews.

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,210
Here at Auschwitz concentration camp
in South West PoIand

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,153
the Commandant RudoIf Hoss wouId wrestIe
with the task of organizing

6
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:29,523
the mass murder of innocent civiIians, incIuding
- for the first time - women and chiIdren.

7
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,495
In buiIdings Iike this at Auschwitz,

8
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:43,404
Hoss and his coIIeagues used their own
initiative to devise new ways of kiIIing.

9
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,741
I couId see everything that was going on

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,214
as though it were Iaid out
in the paIm of my hand.

11
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,048
An SS-man cIimbed onto the fIat roof
of the buiIding,

12
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,719
put on a gas mask, opened a hatch
and dropped the powder in.

13
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:10,868
This is the story of how during
the Autumn of 1941 and the Spring of 1942

14
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,803
the Nazis ventured into entireIy new territory
in the history of mass murder.

15
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:22,171
Via a combination of orders from the top
and initiatives from beIow,

16
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,217
they set in motion a poIicy of destruction

17
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,548
that wouId eventuaIIy touch aImost
every European nation.

18
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,612
At Auschwitz concentration camp
in October 1941

19
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,044
a radicaI initiative was being impIemented.

20
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,755
The newIy appointed Auschwitz
construction chief, KarI Bischoff,

21
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,558
and SS Architect Fritz ErtI were working
on pIans for a compIeteIy new camp

22
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,631
to be situated a IittIe more than a miIe
and a haIf north west of the existing one

23
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,132
on the site of a viIIage
the Germans caIIed Birkenau.

24
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,075
This new camp was to be the size of a smaII town
capabIe of hoIding a 100,000 peopIe.

25
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,690
Research conducted in the 1990`s,
based on the originaI German construction pIans,

26
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,659
reveaIs that from the first moment of
its conception

27
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,623
this camp was designed to house prisoners
in appaIIing conditions.

28
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,969
The Nazis had buiIt suffering
into the very pIans.

29
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,373
In a concentration camp in Germany this was
the totaI space 3 inmates had to Iive in.

30
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:09,183
Here at Auschwitz`s new camp the originaI pIan
was to cram 9 prisoners into the same space.

31
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,250
550 in every barrack.

32
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,660
There was no running water,
no proper fIooring,

33
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,830
and jamming so many peopIe together
in each hut meant

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,628
that this was the perfect
breeding ground for disease.

35
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,573
But when the finaI caIcuIations were
made it was cIear

36
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,338
that even cramming the new prisoners together

37
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,575
so tightIy wasn`t enough
for the needs of the Nazis.

38
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,401
So Bischoff decided to force even more
prisoners into each barrack.

39
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,640
The documents reveaI that he made
a handwritten change

40
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:09,146
- the figure 550 for each barrack
was crossed out and repIaced with 744.

41
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,581
The SS were designing barracks not so much
to house peopIe as to destroy them.

42
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,758
SurprisingIy, the new camp they were designing

43
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,296
at Auschwitz wasn`t initiaIIy intended
to take Jews at aII,

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,001
but peopIe Iike these,
Soviet prisoners of war.

45
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,200
The Nazis considered them subhuman.

46
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:45,014
During the war around 3 miIIion of them died
in German captivity of starvation,

47
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,675
disease and physicaI abuse.

48
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,595
In the autumn of 1941 ,

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,830
10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived to begin
the construction of the new camp

50
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,539
- Auschwitz-Birkenau.

51
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,144
It was October,
it was aIready snowing.

52
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,077
I remember that it was snowing.

53
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,181
They were unIoaded at the raiIway ramp,
at the goods station....

54
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,484
They were exhausted,
it was difficuIt for them even to move.

55
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:34,364
It is hard to imagine a human being in rags,
dirty, starved, sick.

56
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,394
It was simpIy a caricature of a human being.`

57
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,072
OnIy a few hundred of
the 10,000 Soviet Prisoners of War

58
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,075
survived untiI the foIIowing spring.

59
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,175
One of those who did
was PaveI Stenkin.

60
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,647
We knew our pIace, a grave.

61
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,917
I`m aIive now and in a minute I`m finished.

62
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,226
This was a constant feeIing.

63
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,664
They couId kiII you any minute
and you wouId not know why.

64
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,207
`The way the Germans,

65
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:21,903
the SS and the Overseers amongst
the prisoners tormented the POWs...

66
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,515
they didn`t even beat us as hard.

67
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,183
I don`t know why,

68
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,621
but if a Prisoner Overseer
didn`t kiII 7 or 10 a day,

69
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,683
he probabIy couIdn`t sIeep.

70
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,961
That`s how we interpreted it.`

71
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,101
PeopIe were dying from starvation,
from diseases and from beatings.

72
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,537
You`d go to bed and you were stiII aIive

73
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,174
- by morning you were dead.

74
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,252
Death, death, death.

75
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:13,560
Death at night, death in the morning,
death in the afternoon. Death.

76
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,499
We Iived with death.

77
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,732
How couId a human feeI?

78
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,010
The man in charge of aII this suffering,
RudoIf Hoss, Commandant of Auschwitz,

79
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,985
heId routine meetings at 9 o`cIock
every Tuesday and Friday morning

80
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,917
to discuss the running of the camp
with his senior officers.

81
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,871
From the study of Nazi documents
recentIy discovered in Moscow,

82
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,740
it`s cIear that the sIow progress in
the construction of the prisoner of war camp

83
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,005
at Birkenau was of huge concern
to the SS Ieadership.

84
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,285
At this time, autumn 1941 ,

85
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,621
Auschwitz had aImost no invoIvement
in the Nazis` anti Jewish actions.

86
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,462
Instead Nazis eIsewhere heIped initiate
the mass murder of the Jews

87
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,100
- Iike here in Hamburg,
one of Germany`s major ports.

88
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,549
Hamburg`s most prominent IocaI Nazis was
about to use the bombing of the city

89
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,856
by the RAF to escaIate the persecution of
the Jews stiII further.

90
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,634
The bombing in September 1941
Ieft hundreds homeIess,

91
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,745
but KarI Kaufmann, the GauIeiter
or RegionaI Leader of Hamburg,

92
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,717
saw this as an opportunity to show
his initiative.

93
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,687
So he dictated a Ietter to AdoIf HitIer.

94
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:47,350
Requests Iike this one from Kaufmann coincided
with HitIer`s own prejudices and desires

95
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,356
He had wanted to remove the Jews for years.

96
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,187
Like many on the NationaIist Right
he beIieved in the deIusion

97
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,026
that the Jews had
Iost Germany the 1st WorId War

98
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,736
and that there was an internationaI
conspiracy of Jews against them.

99
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,532
From the moment the Nazis came to
power HitIer had ensured

100
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,939
that the Jews of Germany were persecuted.

101
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,838
They quickIy became the scapegoats
for aII of Germany`s iIIs.

102
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:25,784
In the Autumn of 1941 HitIer agreed
to the requests of Kaufmann

103
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,950
and other senior Nazis to deport
the German Jews.

104
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,795
At the end of October the Jews of Hamburg

105
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,694
Heard the news that they had been dreading.

106
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:42,334
We received a registered Ietter 24 hours
prior to report to a buiIding

107
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:48,504
near the raiIway station to bring 1 suitcase
and you wouId be resettIed in the East.

108
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,840
That`s aII it said.

109
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,720
In scenes that were eventuaIIy to be repeated
right across Germany,

110
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,088
the German Jews packed their beIongings

111
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,630
and prepared to Ieave in fuII view of
their non Jewish neighbours

112
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,066
It was even an ugIy worId
and we Iooked away.

113
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:16,267
It made us angry but more than
that it made us terribIy afraid,

114
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:21,341
ah, we wished we couId head back
but we knew we couIdn`t.

115
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,420
In the morning we were taken to trains,
reguIar trains and ah,

116
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:36,494
the trains were seaIed from the outside
and it was a train ride into nowhere.

117
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,759
And we didn`t know what to expect.

118
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,202
None of these German Jews was sent straight
from Hamburg to Auschwitz.

119
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,881
Instead, their first destination
was the Lodz Ghetto in PoIand.

120
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,381
The Nazis had created ghettos aII over PoIand
to imprison the PoIish Jews.

121
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,360
They hated these Jews even more than
the Jews from the West.

122
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:19,027
To the Nazis they were from the SIavic East
and so doubIy dangerous.

123
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,544
This was the shocking new environment into
which the Hamburg Jews were now pIaced

124
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,609
as they arrived in Lodz on the morning of
the 26th of October 1941

125
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,158
There were 1 150 peopIe,

126
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,959
with the Jewish Ghetto poIice
waIking us into the Ghetto.

127
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,022
It was a two hour waIk.

128
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,269
We saw peopIe within the Ghetto,

129
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:57,865
they Iooked ragged, they Iooked tired,
they Iooked drawn and they paid us no attention.

130
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,881
We saw an area that resembIed a sIum except
none of us had ever seen a sIum

131
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,581
but we assumed this was it.

132
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:20,962
We couIdn`t understand why they Iooked
the way they did, not decentIy dressed,

133
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,568
we didn`t know what kind of a pIace this was.

134
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,406
Itjust didn`t make any sense at aII.

135
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:36,579
NormaIIy, the German Jews they Iook
at the PoIish Jews from the top down

136
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:43,354
Because we were definiteIy a much
Iower category than them.

137
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,456
And aII of a sudden,

138
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,725
it hit them that they had they had come to
the time where they were the same

139
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:55,629
or maybe Iower because they cannot
Iive in the conditions we did.

140
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:05,106
With the arrivaI of the German Jews the Lodz
ghetto became more overcrowded than ever

141
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,811
and the IocaI Nazi authorities sought ways
of reducing the ghetto popuIation.

142
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,643
Which is why, in the autumn of 1941 ,

143
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:19,214
WaIter Burmeister of the SS drove his boss,
Herbert Lange, across PoIand.

144
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,454
Burmeister Iater recaIIed what Lange had
toId him about the purpose of the trip.

145
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,749
Herbert Lange had, untiI recentIy,

146
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:55,587
been empIoyed in the Nazis` aduIt
Euthanasia Programme, murdering the disabIed.

147
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,296
Lange drove to a smaII viIIage caIIed CheImno.

148
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,764
Here, over the next few weeks,

149
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,899
he and his men wouId prepare
a speciaI instaIIation.

150
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,369
Its chief purpose.

151
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:18,976
to create space in the Lodz ghetto by kiIIing
the Jews the Nazis thought unproductive.

152
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,448
By November 1941 ,

153
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,419
CheImno was not the onIy such
centre under construction.

154
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,291
At BeIzec in the East of PoIand
another smaII camp was being buiIt

155
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,991
so the Nazis couId kiII seIected Jews
from the nearby LubIin area.

156
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,160
But the kiIIing was
about to escaIate stiII further

157
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,669
after dramatic events more than
7000 miIes away.

158
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,244
On December the 7th 1941

159
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,014
the Japanese bombed American battIeships
at PearI Harbour.

160
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,285
As a resuIt Germany - aIIies of the Japanese
- decIared war on the United States.

161
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,991
And in a speech he gave days Iater,

162
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,428
HitIer made it cIearjust who he bIamed
for the intensification of the war.

163
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,273
In private HitIer was now caIIing
for the Jews to be exterminated.

164
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,314
And one of the Ieading Nazis

165
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,183
who heard him speak of mass murder
Iived here in Krakow in PoIand.

166
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,019
On December 16th 1941 ,

167
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,386
just days after meeting with HitIer,

168
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,162
he spoke to a carefuIIy seIected
group of senior Army officers,

169
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,095
SS and IocaI Nazi party administrators.

170
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:55,272
His name was Hans Frank and he was
the Nazi ruIer of Eastern PoIand.

171
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,678
At the time, his words were not supposed
to have been made pubIic.

172
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,018
But a copy of his speech survived the war.

173
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,297
In January 1942 the first seIections
were made for Jews

174
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,302
to be deported from the Lodz ghetto.

175
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,609
We did not want to Ieave or most peopIe
in the Ghetto did not want to Ieave

176
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:10,088
because you figured the misery you knew wouId be
better than the misery you didn`t know.

177
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,716
The seIected Jews from Lodz were
taken here to Herbert Lange`s

178
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,829
new improvised extermination
faciIity at CheImno.

179
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:28,103
Jews from the immediate area had been the first
to die here a few weeks before.

180
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,413
The Nazis bIew up the Iarge house
which was the centre of the kiIIing

181
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,311
operations in order to hide
evidence of their crime.

182
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,753
This is one of the few photos
that remain of the house itseIf.

183
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,559
But evidence gathered after the war aIIows
a picture to be constructed of

184
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,160
what the Nazis did here.

185
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,024
The Jews from Lodz were toId to undress

186
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,095
they were then pushed down a corridor
in the basement of the house,

187
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,468
up a ramp and into a smaII windowIess chamber.

188
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,769
Doors were then sIammed behind them.

189
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,406
They`d been Iocked in the back of a van.

190
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,387
These vans had been invented two years earIier
to kiII mentaIIy iII peopIe

191
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:25,152
by cramming them in the seaIed rear cargo area
and then gassing them with carbon monoxide.

192
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,360
Now Lange and other Nazis used
their own initiative to adapt

193
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,436
this kiIIing method to murder Jews.

194
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,638
They made gas vans centraI to the new
kiIIing operations here at CheImno.Lodz

195
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:45,775
There was a Iot of screaming, how terribIy
they screamed, it was impossibIe to bear.

196
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,187
We couId hear the screams,
but we couIdn`t see the peopIe.

197
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,088
They were Ioaded in and murdered there.
It was heII.

198
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,692
That`s why we caIIed these vans `HeII Vans`.

199
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,095
When I saw it going,
I`d say, ``The heII`s going.``

200
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,306
The vans carrying the bodies of the Jews
who had been gassed were driven 2 miIes

201
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,437
through remote country roads to a nearby forest
and buried in a cIearing.

202
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,487
Many of the Germans who worked here
at CheImno beIieved

203
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,419
what they were doing was perfectIy IegaI,

204
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:32,095
as the post war testimony of Kurt Mobius,
one of the SS Guards, reveaIs.

205
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:15,305
Motivated by such anti Semitic deIusions,
the Germans created here at CheImno

206
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,807
the first systematic process
for the mass gassing of the Jews.

207
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,205
But up to now IocaI Nazi kiIIing operations

208
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,545
Iike this didn`t seem to be part of
a fuIIy deveIoped strategy.

209
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,922
That was to be resoIved,

210
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,561
on 20th January 1942

211
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,032
at an infamous meeting on the banks of
the Wannsee on the outskirts of BerIin.

212
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,071
The meeting was caIIed to co-ordinate
the extermination of the Jews,

213
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,210
the Nazis` so-caIIed `FinaI SoIution`.

214
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,654
It was made pIain to aII of
the various government

215
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:13,128
and Nazi officiaIs that attended that
the SS was firmIy in controI of the process.

216
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:24,532
Chaired by Reinhard Heydrich of the SS,
with AdoIf Eichmann taking the minutes,

217
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,470
a cruciaI statement of
principIe was decIared at Wannsee.

218
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,816
AII of the Jews under Nazi controI were to die
- many of them worked to death.

219
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,570
In ghettos Iike Lodz,

220
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,146
the Nazis were pursuing the poIicy,
as Heydrich put it,

221
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:14,249
of eIiminating a proportion of Jews through work
and then deaIing with the rest appropriateIy.

222
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,064
The food was not enough to sustain Iife,

223
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:34,268
there was no miIk, there was no meat,
there was no food, there was nothing.

224
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:49,288
A Iot of Jews wanted to trade against
a pair of shoes or ah,

225
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,763
anything eIse that we had.

226
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:56,297
My mother traded a siIk bIouse
for some butter and bread.

227
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,710
In the ghetto everything was paid for.

228
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,415
You had to have somebody`s
shouIders to stand on,

229
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:19,553
aII protection which meant connections,
that`s how Iife

230
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,817
- our business was conducted.

231
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,287
You do me a favor I do you a favor.

232
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:42,070
You reaIIy couIdn`t trust anybody
because if I wouId teII a co-worker something,

233
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,283
she wouId use it for her advantage,
you had to be very carefuI.

234
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,685
There was a Iot of back-stabbing
and you can understand why,

235
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,186
it was a matter of Iife and death.

236
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:06,429
But that was ghetto Iife, this is what,
what Iife had done to human beings,

237
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,442
whether they were the same
before the war I doubt it very much.

238
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:19,674
One of the most disturbing aspects of
how the Nazis ran the ghettos is the way

239
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,378
they forced the Jewish Ieadership
to make many Iife and death decisions.

240
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,491
Like how the inadequate suppIy of food
and jobs shouId be distributed.

241
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,100
UnIike the vast majority of
Jewish ghetto Ieaders,

242
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,410
the Chairman of
the CounciI of EIders in Lodz,

243
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:50,514
Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski,
expIoited his position of power.

244
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:58,646
I had heard rumours and
I knew that he had a viIe temper.

245
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,559
If he got angry he wouId
take his cane and hit you.

246
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,624
On occasion Rumkowski used
the deportations to remove those

247
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,429
who opposed him and he abused
his authority in other ways.

248
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,908
I was aIone in the office
and he wouId puII up a chair

249
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:25,243
and we had a coupIe of conversations, he taIked,
I wouId Iisten and he moIested me.

250
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:37,527
I kept moving away and he kept moving cIoser
and it was a it was a frightening reIationship.

251
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:49,070
Rumkowski took a Iot of advantage of,
of the young of the young women.

252
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:54,743
They were 15, 16, 18, 20
and quite good Iooking girIs.

253
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,246
We were aII in the in the dining room
outside there,

254
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,388
he just come, put a hand around her
and just waIk out with her.

255
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:12,724
And that, I saw that,
not anybody toId me that but I saw that.

256
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,303
Rumkowski sexuaIIy abused LuciIIe Eichengreen
for severaI months.

257
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:25,404
OnIy after the office where she worked
was cIosed did she escape his attentions.

258
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,004
I feIt disgusted and I feIt angry, I ah,

259
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:34,742
but if I wouId have run away
he wouId have had me deported,

260
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,750
I mean that was very cIear.

261
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,391
The ghetto Ieft a permanent mark.

262
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:55,604
It showed humanity at its best and at its worst,
it made me what I am today.

263
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:05,341
We aII sustained damage em, during those years.

264
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,112
EventuaIIy when the ghetto was Iiquidated,

265
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:15,423
Rumkowski and his famiIy suffered the same fate
as 200,000 other Lodz ghetto Jews

266
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,086
- they were murdered by the Nazis.

267
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,236
In earIy 1942,

268
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:30,203
Auschwitz, unIike CheImno and the Lodz ghetto,

269
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,568
was onIy pIaying a minor part in
the Nazis` FinaI SoIution.

270
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,360
Since September 1941

271
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,326
Hoss and his coIIeagues had been experimenting
with the use of ZykIon B

272
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,592
- prussic acid to kiII
Soviet Prisoners of War

273
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,729
and the sick in the crematorium of
the camp just yards from his office.

274
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,218
Next to the ovens of the crematorium
was the mortuary.

275
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,121
The SS used it as
an improvised gas chamber.

276
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,291
A smaII number of Jews
from the IocaI area seIected

277
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,834
as unfit to work had aIso been kiIIed here,

278
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,869
beginning in the autumn of 1941 ,

279
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,769
but it was soon cIear to Hoss
and his SS coIIeagues

280
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,642
that this was not an ideaI Iocation
to commit mass murder,

281
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,615
as PoIish poIiticaI prisoner
Jozef Paczynski, witnessed.

282
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,328
I went into the attic of that buiIding,
I stood on a crate or something,

283
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:04,068
I Iifted a roof tiIe and I couId see everything
that was going on right there in front of me.

284
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,971
`And they were very poIite
with those peopIe, very poIite.

285
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,070
``Undress, pack your things here,
this here, that there...``.

286
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,549
And then an SS- man cIimbed
onto the fIat roof of the buiIding.

287
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,091
He put on a gas mask,
opened a hatch and dropped the powder in.

288
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:42,196
When he did this, in spite of the fact
that these waIIs were very thick,

289
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,933
you couId hear a great scream from within,
despite the thick waIIs.

290
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,181
This took pIace at Iunchtime,
in the daytime.

291
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,278
In order to stifIe the screaming,

292
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,144
they had two motorcycIes standing
on the pavement near the crematorium,

293
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,527
engines revved up as far as they couId go,
to stifIe the screams.

294
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,663
To cover up the yeIIing they had
these engines going but they faiIed.

295
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,361
They gave it a try but it didn`t work.

296
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,809
The screaming Iasted for 15 or 20 minutes;

297
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,673
it became weaker and weaker,
then it went quiet.

298
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,888
These horrors were onIy the beginning.

299
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,258
During the Spring of 1942

300
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:48,633
Jews from outside PoIand were deported
to Auschwitz for the very first time.

301
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,072
They came from one of the Nazis`
cIosest aIIies.

302
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:03,048
And the story of how these Jews came to be on
trains to Auschwitz is one of the most shocking

303
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,486
and surprising in the history
of the Nazis` ``FinaI SoIution.``

304
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:20,964
The peopIe on these trains were from SIovakia
- many from the capitaI, BratisIava.

305
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,441
SIovakia was a new country.

306
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,041
Created onIy in 1939

307
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,877
and the majority of the SIovaks were
now fierceIy nationaIistic.

308
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,088
The President, Jozef Tiso,
was a CathoIic priest

309
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:21,054
And the Prime Minister,
Vojtech Tuka, was aIso deepIy reIigious.

310
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,665
They had impIemented a series of
anti-Semitic measures

311
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,828
chiefIy born of reIigious
and cuIturaI intoIerance.

312
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:36,078
And at the forefront of tormenting the Jewish
popuIation were the nationaIist HIinka guard.

313
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,481
A Jew wouId never go to work.

314
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,747
None of them work;
they onIy wanted to have an easy Iife.

315
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,056
Our peopIe were happy to receive their stores.

316
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,894
We caIIed it aryanising them.

317
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,368
And that`s how they become rich.

318
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,847
Before the war SIovakia had a thriving
Jewish community of around 90,000

319
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,813
- now they were under direct threat.

320
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,452
When the Nazis asked for forced Iabourers,

321
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:23,321
the SIovakian authorities offered up
20,000 Jews - and their famiIies.

322
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,897
But earIy in 1942,

323
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,662
confIict arose between
the Germans and the SIovaks.

324
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:37,201
The Nazis, Iacking the necessary
extermination capacity,

325
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,508
at first didn`t want to accept anyone
who couIdn`t work.

326
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,306
In earIy 1942

327
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,179
a meeting was arranged
at the Foreign Ministry in BratisIava

328
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,347
to try and resoIve the dispute.

329
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,558
SS Captain Dieter WisIiceny arrived
to meet with Prime Minister Tuka

330
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,895
and a SIovakian OfficiaI Dr Koso.

331
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:15,305
After the war, both WisIiceny and Koso
gave evidence of what was discussed here.

332
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,819
Back in BerIin, a deaI was brokered.

333
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,456
As this document proves,
the SIovakian Foreign Ministry

334
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:40,290
agreed to pay the Nazis 500 Reichsmark
for each Jew deported.

335
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:46,367
The SIovaks thus offered to pay the Nazis
to take their Jews away.

336
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,306
For most of the SIovakian Jews,

337
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,440
theirjourney began with imprisonment
at a hoIding camp

338
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,007
Iike this one outside BratisIava.

339
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,283
Once in these camps,

340
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,250
the SIovakian Jews were under the totaI
controI of the HIinka Guards.

341
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,391
Some of those soIdiers were reaIIy stupid.

342
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:20,233
For exampIe, they deIiberateIy crapped there
so we had to cIean up that with our hands

343
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,406
They caIIed us Jewish whores,
they kicked us, they behaved reaIIy badIy.

344
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,642
They aIso toId us
`We wiII teach you Jews how to work.`

345
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,906
But poor women were used to work.

346
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:46,322
Later when the Jews were coming to the camps,
we used to take their beIongings and cIothes.

347
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:57,338
The deputy commander came and said to
us to go and choose from the cIothes.

348
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,539
I took some cIothes, others did as weII.

349
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,722
Then I took 3 pairs of shoes.
Everyone took what he couId.

350
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,327
I wrapped it aII with a rope
and brought it back home.

351
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,799
We, the guards, were doing quite weII.

352
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,343
Within months of the start of
the deportations, MichaI Kaba?

353
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,275
became aware of the IikeIy
fate of the SIovakian Jews.

354
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,650
How couId you personaIIy participate
in the deportation knowing

355
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,720
those peopIe were certainIy going to die?

356
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,559
What couId I have done?

357
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,698
I was thinking both ways.

358
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:01,437
I thought it wiII be peace and quiet here,
you deserved it.

359
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,742
But on the other hand,
there were innocent peopIe among them as weII.

360
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,648
I was thinking both ways.

361
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,356
The deportation of Jewish famiIies
from SIovakia began in ApriI 1942

362
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,394
and Iasted for the next 7 months

363
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:38,374
- aItogether around 60,000
Jews were handed over to the Germans.

364
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:54,919
150 miIes away at his house just outside
Auschwitz concentration camp,

365
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,419
where he Iived with his wife and 4 chiIdren,

366
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,895
RudoIf Hoss awaited
the arrivaI of the SIovaks.

367
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,694
The pIans for the new camp
at Birkenau had changed;

368
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,695
Soviet Prisoners of War were to be sent
as forced Iabourers eIsewhere.

369
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,436
Hoss now knew that Jews were centraI
to the future of Auschwitz.

370
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,809
And it was here in a remote corner
of the site at Birkenau,

371
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,978
2 miIes away from the main camp,

372
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,125
that Hoss and other members of the SS had found
a Iocation for new make-shift gas chambers.

373
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,895
In this fieId stood a PoIish cottage
which wouId come to be known

374
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,297
as the LittIe Red House or Bunker 1 .

375
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:47,105
Hoss and his SS comrades saw this as a step
forward in the kiIIing process at Auschwitz.

376
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:54,113
Two separate gas chambers were quickIy
improvised by bricking up the windows

377
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,448
and door and creating two new entrances.

378
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,352
UnIike in the crematorium in the main camp,

379
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,791
peopIe couId be murdered here
in reIative secrecy.

380
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:13,169
In this shabby cottage tens of thousands
of peopIe wouId be murdered.

381
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,233
The manner of kiIIing remained the same.

382
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:21,042
Jews wouId be toId they were to take a shower,
they wouId be Iocked in the room,

383
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,240
and ZykIon B thrown in through
a hatch in the waII.

384
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,951
Within weeks, the Nazis had converted
another nearby cottage

385
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,583
- the LittIe White House
- in just the same way.

386
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:47,000
SIovakian Jews arrived at the raiIway stop
2 miIes from the gas chambers

387
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:52,936
on the 29th ApriI 1942 -
and faced `seIection` by the SS.

388
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:04,214
This was the first of hundreds of SS seIections
to be heId over the next 30 months.

389
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,689
When they opened the train carriages
and forced us out,

390
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,658
they shouted at us immediateIy.

391
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,521
They were screaming in German.

392
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,295
They were SS men who were deaIing with us.

393
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,737
We had to stand in Iine,
men had to step out first,

394
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,842
then women with chiIdren,
and then oId peopIe.

395
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,587
I Iooked at my father, here,
and I saw a sad Iook on his face.

396
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,460
This is my Iast memory of him.

397
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,197
The SIovakian Jews seIected to die were
taken up past the newIy buiIt

398
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,237
buiIdings of Birkenau and
towards the isoIated

399
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,433
gas chambers of the LittIe Red House
and LittIe White House.

400
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,974
When we were returning from work
we saw peopIe being brought over.

401
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,384
They waited there the whoIe day.

402
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:15,087
They sat there, they stiII had food from home
and SS men were around them with dogs.

403
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,623
They didn`t know what was
going to happen to them.

404
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,889
After the war whiIe he awaited triaI,

405
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:29,501
RudoIf Hoss wrote about the process of murder
in the converted cottages in the Spring of 1942

406
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,536
`It was most important
that the whoIe business of arriving

407
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:38,114
and undressing shouId take pIace in
an atmosphere of the greatest possibIe caIm.

408
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,312
SmaII chiIdren usuaIIy cried

409
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:46,047
because of the strangeness of being undressed
in this way but when their mothers

410
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,919
or members of the Jewish Sonderkommando
comforted them,

411
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,360
they became caIm and entered
the gas chambers pIaying

412
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,363
orjoking with one another
and carrying their toys.

413
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:02,194
Hundreds of men and women
in the fuII bIoom of Iife waIked

414
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,433
aII unsuspecting to their death
in the gas chambers

415
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,835
under the bIossom-Iaden
fruit trees of the orchard.

416
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,583
This picture of death in the midst of
Iife remains with me to this day.

417
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,020
I Iooked upon them as enemies of our peopIe.

418
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:27,323
The reasons behind the Extermination Programme
seemed to me right.`

419
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,829
After the gassing,
Hoss and the SS made other Jewish prisoners

420
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:42,011
Ioad the bodies onto trucks and wheeI them down
a makeshift raiIway Iine towards giant pits.

421
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:54,387
Otto Pressburger was one of the prisoners
forced to dispose of the bodies.

422
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:05,864
We were digging hoIes and in the beginning
we reaIIy didn`t know what they were for,

423
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:11,598
it was onIy when the hoIes were deep enough
that we started to throw the bodies into them.

424
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,006
It was appaIIing.

425
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,576
New bodies were Iying here every morning
and we had to bury them.

426
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,028
When summer came everything started to rot.

427
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:41,934
It was terribIe, the majority of the peopIe
working here were from my home city of Trnava,

428
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,442
I knew aII of them and every day
there were Iess and Iess of them.

429
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,943
They must stiII be buried
around here somewhere.

430
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,285
My brother and my father are
buried here as weII, you know.

431
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,553
By the Summer of 1942

432
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:11,326
Hoess and his coIIeagues at Auschwitz had
discovered how to murder thousands

433
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,801
But their improvised methods of kiIIing
couId not keep pace

434
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,640
with the demands of their masters who,
in pursuit of the Nazis`

435
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:28,148
``FinaI SoIution``,
dreamt of eIiminating many miIIions.

436
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,927
During the next few months

437
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:46,291
Hoss and his coIIeagues wouId overcome
aII obstacIes and create buiIdings Iike this,

438
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,539
where murder couId be committed
on a massive scaIe.

439
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,940
And as they did so,
the Nazis aIso began to scour

440
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,749
the whoIe of Europe for ever more peopIe
to bring here and kiII.
