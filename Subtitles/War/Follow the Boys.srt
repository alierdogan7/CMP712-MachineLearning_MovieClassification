00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,152
<i>(♪ Tonight)</i>

2
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,312
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,353
you've just witnessed
the closing of the Palace Theatre

4
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,791
and the people on the bill
have delegated my dad

5
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,991
to speak for all of us.

6
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
(Applause)

7
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,233
Thanks, son.

8
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,396
(Applause dies down)

9
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,799
Well, folks, I...I really don't think
there's much that I can say, I'm...

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,639
But I do know that most of you out there

11
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,960
feel just as badly about
the closing of this place as...as we do.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,630
And of course...of course you know
it only means one thing.

13
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,469
It means...it means the end of vaudeville.

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,278
(Laughs) I...I had a big speech
all prepared for this tonight but I...

15
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,639
I don't know, er...

16
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,673
(Son) I'm sure you all know
what my dad was about to say.

17
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,872
Laughter's been a habit
in this country for a good many years,

18
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,037
and I think it's here to stay.

19
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,313
I'm sure it's here to stay when you see
such friends as...Miss Sophie Tucker.

20
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,519
And another old friend, Mr Ted Lewis.

21
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,591
Let me have your hat, Tony.

22
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,032
Hey, wait a minute, Ted.
Things are tough enough already.

23
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,790
Is everybody happy?

24
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,277
Gee, thanks, folks. You know,
it's a pleasure to be here.

25
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,915
I've been here so many times before.

26
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,314
(♪ Violins)

27
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,910
And what stars lit these footlights!

28
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,159
Right there, Nora Bayes,
Fanny Brice, Will Rogers.

29
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,557
So great that vaudeville audiences
doubled the gate

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,160
until Ziegfeld took them away.

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,475
And those stars keep on shining

32
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,591
They'll never die

33
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,757
They're right here beside me

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,032
Like you and I

35
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,515
And they're saying

36
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
Good night

37
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,392
Palace nights

38
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,117
And the fame of a name up in lights

39
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,755
None forgot

40
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,360
And it means a lot

41
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,077
On this wonderful night of nights

42
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,315
Good night

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,478
No, no, no, not goodbye

44
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,720
Who's ashamed of a tear in your eye?

45
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,715
Their memories live on

46
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,390
Although this may be gone

47
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,554
So long now, old pals

48
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,870
Good night

49
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,550
Good night

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,240
(♪ Orchestra plays Auld Lang Syne)

51
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,313
- So long, Nick.
- So long.

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,159
Louie, you know anybody
who wants to buy Indian clubs?

53
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,157
- I don't know any Indians.
- Oooh.

54
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,477
It's jokes like that that closed this theatre.

55
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,910
- I'll be right up, Pops.
- All right, son.

56
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,150
- Hey, West, you're closing tonight.
- Didn't go very well, did we?

57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,353
You said it, brother. I've seen acts
lay an egg but yours is an omelette.

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,320
Look, baby, you got nothing to worry
about. I can still use you.

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,477
Oh, I'm not interested, Mr Loomis.

60
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,399
- Wait a minute, I wanna tell you something.
- Let her alone.

61
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,315
Ow!

62
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,794
40 years in show business
and that's the first time I've ever been fired.

63
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,470
Oh, Forget about it, Dad.
This isn't show business.

64
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,358
- Louie!
- Ho, Louie.

65
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,040
Where'd you come from?
How'd you find us?

66
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,151
Fifi picked up your trail on 46th Street.

67
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,034
From there on, it was easy.
She can smell ham a mile away.

68
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,799
Well, how have things been going?

69
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,719
- Oh, pretty good.
- We'll settle for pretty good.

70
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,958
- Think I could I get a job here?
- Not unless Fifi puts on tights.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,198
I got to find something pretty soon
or get out of the business.

72
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,154
- That goes for us too.
- We're out of it now. Only we don't know it.

73
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,638
I still think we oughta go to Hollywood.
I wish you and Kitty'd go with me.

74
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,959
How many times do I have to tell you you'll
never get me in that canned entertainment?

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,993
They were after me to sign Fifi.
I told 'em where to get off.

76
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,115
- Fifi stays in the legitimate theatre.
- She'll soon have it all to herself.

77
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,358
Dad, I wish you wouldn't be
so pig-headed.

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,440
We've hit bottom, and the only thing
we haven't tried is pictures.

79
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,435
And as far as I'm concerned,
it's California here I come.

80
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,439
(Man) Places, please.

81
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,590
(♪ Show tune)

82
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,559
Hold it. Hold it.

83
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,319
(Music stops)

84
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,751
- It just doesn't come off.
- I thought It looked pretty good.

85
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,430
- What's the matter, Frank?
- There's something wrong with the number.

86
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,269
- It's exactly how we rehearsed it.
- But I still think it misses somehow.

87
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,993
(Frank) Let's sit down and talk about it.
(Woman) Mm-hm.

88
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,317
- Eddie, call lunch.
- All right, that will be lunch, everybody.

89
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,670
Back in these same places in one hour.

90
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,075
Hello, Jack? Tony West.

91
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,319
Tony West.

92
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,397
No, I can't make it tonight.

93
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, we're having a little trouble on the set.

94
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,876
They're trying to make Gloria Vance
a rhythm dancer in one easy lesson.

95
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,559
What?

96
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,037
Can't you just see me barging in
and telling them what to do?

97
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,072
No, not me.

98
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,755
Look, Jack, they hired me
to hoof in the background

99
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,519
and that's all they're gonna get.

100
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,873
Sure, I could straighten her out in 20
minutes but why should I stick my chin out?

101
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,233
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.
I got to go and grab some lunch. So long.

102
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,072
- Wait a minute.
- Me?

103
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,713
Yes, you.

104
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,832
I couldn't help
overhearing your telephone conversation.

105
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,315
Sorry, I didn't think I was talking so loud.

106
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,114
It was very interesting.
I'd like to hear some more.

107
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,119
Well, Miss Vance, I seen all your pictures
and I like them.

108
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,913
- You're good.
- Thank you.

109
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,520
But not half as good as you could be.

110
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,917
Perhaps I'm a little dull
but I don't quite understand.

111
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,474
Ballet dancing is an art,

112
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,718
and when you combine it with rhythm,
that's something else.

113
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,752
Well, what would you suggest?

114
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,157
I have some definite ideas
along those lines.

115
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,558
- I'd like to hear them some time.
- Don't worry, you will.

116
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,397
(Both laugh)

117
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,438
Very funny.

118
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,193
Come in.

119
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,912
Miss Vance, I didn't want to go
too far in front of Mr Taylor.

120
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,032
- After all, he's the director.
- You barge in here like this?

121
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,434
You wanted to hear my idea.

122
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,995
- It'll just take a minute.
- That'll be too long.

123
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,874
There's something
I gotta tell you. Listen to me.

124
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,754
My name was on Broadway
when you were Bertha Lindqvist,

125
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,712
the broad in the silverware ads.

126
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,231
- Dancing's my business.
- You all right, Miss Vance?

127
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,591
I will be, as soon as
you remove this crackpot.

128
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,872
- OK, bud, let's go.
- I guess it is getting crowded in here.

129
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,071
I'll see you when we can have some privacy.

130
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,437
(Buzzer)

131
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,711
That must be Dr Henderson.

132
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,194
- Hello, Jim, darling.
- Jim?

133
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,313
- Tony's the name. Remember me?
- Why, yes, I...

134
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,238
- Now, really, Mr...
- West. Tony West.

135
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,590
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I am.

136
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,554
Lucky I dropped in before you left.
Mind if we sit down?

137
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,276
Not at all. Too bad you couldn't
make it in time for dinner.

138
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,800
Oh, thanks just the same.

139
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,639
About that routine today,
nothing was wrong with you.

140
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,990
- You know what was the matter?
- No.

141
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,953
You need a dancing partner.

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,560
Are you by any chance suggesting yourself?

143
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,717
Frankly, I'm leading up to it.

144
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,992
- You have no inhibitions, have you?
- I can't afford them.

145
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,874
Listen, Miss Vance,
I've been a dancer all my life...

146
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,992
Excuse me, Miss Vance,
Dr Henderson is calling.

147
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,111
Thank you, Annie.

148
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,195
You will excuse me, won't you?

149
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,833
No hurry.

150
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,719
(Whistles)

151
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,030
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, darling.

152
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,958
I know what you're going to say

153
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,311
but I just got an emergency call
to get down to the hospital.

154
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,912
If you'll give me another date tomorrow,
I won't allow anything to interfere.

155
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,350
Unless I get another emergency call.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,438
All right, darling. See you tomorrow. Bye.

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
Annie, I won't need this.

158
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,511
- You're not going out?
- No.

159
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,029
There's a better show in the living room.

160
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,834
(Whispers) I'm about to stick
a pin into a balloon.

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,033
Let's see, you had suggested
yourself as my partner.

162
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,480
That's right.

163
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,072
Supposing I agreed it was practical,
there's more to a picture than just dancing.

164
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,158
Well, I've considered that too.

165
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,510
You've considered everything, haven't you?

166
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,359
(Chuckles) Just about.

167
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,676
- Let's try a scene, shall we?
- Swell.

168
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,433
- Here's a script.
- How about the one you did this morning?

169
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,711
- The love scene?
- Why not?

170
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,831
- Fine.
- I almost know it by heart.

171
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,349
I've watched you rehearse it 40 times.

172
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,360
- That's a slight exaggeration.
- Well, eight by actual count.

173
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,278
We'll take it from page 38.

174
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,552
Colette and Steve are snowbound
in his mountain lodge.

175
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,831
That's good enough for me.

176
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,279
Steve, were you ever in love?

177
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,156
Huh?

178
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,711
- You say, "yes".
- Oh, uh...

179
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,399
Yes.

180
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,954
Recently?

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,151
No, not recently.

182
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,390
Do you have a favourite type
among women?

183
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, blondes.

184
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,680
I shouldn't have liked it
if you'd said brunettes.

185
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,872
I'm only interested in blondes.
How am I doing?

186
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,036
Fine.

187
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,676
Remember, I'm only quoting
from the script.

188
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,189
It's odd, isn't it?

189
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,029
The things that make people
find other people attractive.

190
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,278
A turn of the head, a way of walking...

191
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,679
the trick of speech.

192
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,111
Little things that one man
may not notice at all

193
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,756
can be irresistibly alluring...to another.

194
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,878
- Now, take voices...
- I'll take yours.

195
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,357
- Do you really like my voice?
- I love your voice.

196
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,117
(Sighs)

197
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,234
- Well, go on.
- Oh.

198
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,511
And it's the same
all the way down the line,

199
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,349
hair, eyes, lips,

200
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,437
there's no explaining it.

201
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,200
A woman with the most
perfect figure in the world

202
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,517
may be no more attractive to you
than a marble statue,

203
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,349
and then some scrawny, hipless
little toothpick will come along

204
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,869
and fill you with mad desire.

205
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,190
The guy who wrote this
didn't have me in mind.

206
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,235
(Giggles) Come on.
..and fill you with mad desire.

207
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,752
- Not yet.
- Oh, pardon me.

208
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,035
I think you're the most desirable woman
in the whole world.

209
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,073
Steve, would you do something for me?

210
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,239
- Anything.
- Stick to the script.

211
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,749
All depends on what it is.

212
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,559
It's an odd request from a lady.

213
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,632
Glad to oblige.

214
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,876
Will you marry me?

215
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,154
- Did you ring?
- No.

216
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,960
Oh, I must have touched the button
by mistake.

217
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,956
I see you do a little writing too,
the maid's entrance isn't in here.

218
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,593
- Nice timing.
- I'm...

219
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,474
You needn't be embarrassed,
I was just leaving anyway.

220
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,477
I am not embarrassed.

221
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,472
That's what it says in the script.

222
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,875
And you still need a dancing partner.

223
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,194
(Door closes)

224
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,952
But I tell you, I need a dancing partner.

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,311
And for the 20th time,
I tell you it's out of the question.

226
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,159
Please, Gloria,
there are a lot of people on the set.

227
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,839
You admit the number isn't good.

228
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,600
- But this man is only an extra.
- Isn't that what I was?

229
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,439
His name was on Broadway
before mine was Gloria Vance.

230
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,995
- When you were Bertha Lundqvist...
- Lindqvist.

231
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,035
All right, Lindqvist. Oh, be reasonable.
Go back on the set like a good girl.

232
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,630
- I've always cooperated with the studio.
- Oh, yes...

233
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,798
Worked overtime so you could
catch up on your schedule?

234
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,071
- Yes, but...
- You've got to do this for me.

235
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,635
- Yes, Gloria, I...
- Thanks, Walter.

236
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,592
You're a darling.

237
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,435
Say, you haven't by any chance
fallen for this guy, have you?

238
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,075
That is an understatement.

- Tony.
- Hello, darling. I...tried not to awaken you.

248
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,912
You look so pretty asleep.

249
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,236
Tony, do you know what day this is?

250
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,078
Sure, Saturday.

251
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,317
- Today's our...
- (Both)..third wedding anniversary.

252
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,398
I didn't forget it, honey.
I brought you a little present.

253
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,480
- I've got it here, if I can find it.
- From me to you.

254
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,593
Say, that's smart.

255
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,236
- That'll come in handy some day.
- It'll come in handy tomorrow.

256
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,591
- Here are the reservations for Mexico City.
- Mexico City?

257
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,997
- That's right. We're leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

258
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,236
I just had to do it this way.

259
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,877
Every time we've planned a trip, you've
thought of something to keep us here.

260
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,471
With all my love, baby.

261
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,717
Thank you.

262
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,120
- Oh, It's beautiful.
- Turn it around.

263
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,952
- That's you.
- Right. Now watch.

264
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,476
- Now that's clever.
- You're married to a very clever fella.

265
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,274
- A very wonderful fella.
- Lucky's the word.

266
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,952
Er, Gloria, about that trip,
I don't think I can make it.

267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,677
Oh, we can. We've got two weeks off and
nothing will stop us from going this time.

268
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,599
Last year it was
a personal appearance tour,

269
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,713
the year before, instead of Sun Valley
we went skiing on stage eight.

270
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,719
Darling, you stay packed
and we'll leave Monday morning.

271
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,956
Nothing will stop us this time.

272
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,993
Tony, you're so wonderful,
even when you're lying.

273
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,750
You're even more wonderful
when you don't believe me.

281
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,757
But my knee has never bothered me.

282
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,360
It's an old fracture
that never healed properly.

283
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,598
It happened when I was a kid.
I've been dancing on it ever since.

284
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,996
Dancing's not like
marching with a full pack.

285
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,511
That wouldn't stop me.
I'm in good shape.

286
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,359
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.

287
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,230
Incidentally, Captain,
I'd rather nobody knew I was turned down.

288
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,512
- I understand.
- Thanks.

It's Louie Fairweather's dog act.

291
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,232
No, not the dog track! Will you shut up!

292
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,830
Tony asked me to stop you
betting those horses.

293
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,349
Tell him you did. Hello, Pete.

294
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,437
Ali Baba in the fifth, yeah.

295
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,631
Ten on the nose. You got it?

296
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,040
Good.

297
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,873
(Buzzer)

298
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,389
Don't tell me she rang that doorbell.

299
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,480
Ta-da!

300
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,034
Chick Doyle!

301
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
- Can you beat that?
- Louie!

302
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,956
- Hey, you're looking swell.
- How are you?

303
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,550
- Is this is the city dog pound?
- It's Fairweather's new dog act.

304
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,559
Hollywood caught up with you?
A war picture?

305
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,717
That ain't so. I heard from my draft board.

306
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,673
- That uniform's the real McCoy?
- You can say that again.

307
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,394
They fished my number out of the bag first.

308
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,877
- I'm booked solid.
- Well, what are you doing up here?

309
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,436
Well, they sent me out to look
for some entertainment for the boys.

310
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,951
- So I hunted up you fellas.
- We're kind of out of touch.

311
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,117
We don't know many picture people.

312
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,152
You can whip up some kind of a show.

313
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,351
I could take my new dog act down there.

314
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,915
That's a good idea. And leave it there.

315
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,357
- What about a drink?
- A drink?

316
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,677
Well, you sure put us in a spot, didn't you?

317
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,554
- Me? It was your idea.
- It was your bottle.

318
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,831
Tony'll never get us out of this one.

319
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,156
- Hello, Dad, Louie.
- Tony.

320
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,599
- Uh, where's Gloria?
- Shh...she's in her room.

321
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,359
What's the matter?

322
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,433
- Who promised all this?
- (Both) He did.

323
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,359
- You must've been crazy.
- No, just swacked.

324
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,517
You better get in touch with these stars.

325
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,950
Wait a minute, we don't even know 'em.

326
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,593
We've never met 'em.

327
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,112
- Why didn't you think of that before?
- If it'll make you feel any better, kick me.

328
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,914
It's a large order.
I don't know what to do about it.

329
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,555
Kick your father -
that sounded like a good idea.

330
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,593
Shut up, can't you see he's thinking?

331
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,155
I know...I know I've been a lot of trouble.

332
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,358
Don't worry about it, Dad,
I'll dig up a show somehow.

333
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,158
I told you he'd fix it.

335
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,872
(Man) Here comes Tony West, fellas.
(Soldiers) Hi, Tony.

336
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,594
- Hey, Tony.
- Hello, Tony.

337
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,430
(Bell rings)

338
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,875

339
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,479

340
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,197
(Audience laughs)

341
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,232
(Drum roll)

342
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,509
- Mr West?
- Yes.

343
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,677
We'll sure remember this show a long time.

344
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,280
- There'll be others.
- No, we're going over.

345
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,190
Don't you worry. Wherever there are men
in uniform, there'll be entertainment.

346
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,392
- Show business will come through.
- That's swell.

347
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,274
(Man) Members of
the Hollywood Victory Committee,

348
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,994
it is very gratifying to see represented here

349
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,431
not only the actors' but the screenwriters'
and directors' guilds,

350
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,757
and every other craft and union
in the entertainment industry.

351
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,190
We will make
a large number of training films,

352
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,314
and for the army we are arranging
to supply our overseas forces

353
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,912
with all of our best feature pictures,
many before they are even released here.

354
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,715
Exhibitors will use their theatres
as centres for bond sales,

355
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,039
salvage drives, blood donations,
Red Cross campaigns and other projects.

356
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,311
But all this is merely a beginning.

357
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,273
We are enlisting our efforts in this war
for the duration

358
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,198
and the job to be done is enormous.

359
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,870
Our War Activities Committee
and the studios will finance its costs.

360
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,880
and every actor will be allotted time
to carry on this work.

361
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,391
How the work can best be done
is the reason we are here.

362
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,434
Tony West will now tell us
some of the immediate requirements.

363
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,836
We have a wire here asking our help

364
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,918
in raising a million dollars
for the Army and Navy Relief.

365
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,395
So we need volunteers for a victory caravan

366
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,875
to tour the country to raise this money.

367
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
Swell.

368
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,717
Now, it's going to be up to us
to send the men real living entertainment,

369
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,514
the songs, dances and laughs
they had back home.

370
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,917
Our talent pool will be broken up
into hundreds of units

371
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,680
travelling under the auspices of
the USO camp shows

372
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,872
and the Special Service Division
of the armed services.

373
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,560
This job can't be hit or miss.

374
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,190
I might tell you now that this is
no plush compartment setup.

375
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,553
You'll be travelling in everything from planes
to jeeps to trucks and barges.

376
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,718
The Writers' Mobilisation Committee
is behind us

377
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,356
and will furnish special material
for those who require it.

378
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,393
However this shouldn't
delay anyone from leaving now

379
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,751
because you people
are familiar faces to the men in the service.

380
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,315
They wanna see you, talk to you,

381
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,317
and shake your hand.

382
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,716
Now, are there any questions
or suggestions?

383
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,674
Are these shows to be given only
by motion picture people?

384
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,398
On the contrary, in addition to our industry,
the entertainment world has volunteered.

385
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,194
What's the matter with
the Last of the Red-Hot Mamas?

386
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,119
I'm available next week
after my picture's finished.

387
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,595
(Tony) What about your concert tour,
Jeanette?

388
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,120
I'll have it postponed.

389
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,833
That's the spirit.

390
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,874
- How about an amateur magic show?
- Great.

391
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,550
I'll go anywhere
as long as it's soldiers, sailors or marines.

392
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,911
- (Tony) Swell, Marlene.
- Is there any radio entertainment?

393
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,031
I'm glad you brought that up, Dinah.

394
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,754
In addition
to the broadcasts in this country

395
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,759
we'll reach the men at the front
by short wave.

396
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,840
These programmes are to be called
Command Performance and Mail Call.

397
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,759
- Count me in.
- I'll do some camp shows.

398
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,794
That's for me - I expect to be living in
one of those pup tents soon anyway.

399
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,116
You can count on me.

400
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,552
You'll always find me down at
Little Joe's Cream Puff Emporium

401
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,432
out on Swisses Street.

402
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,551
Bill, I know the boys'll enjoy you.

403
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,196
- We'd like to help too.
- How about me going overseas?

404
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,359
You can count on me
for anything from singin' to cookin'.

405
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,837
Well, I know many of you
have early calls in the morning

406
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,319
so I'd like to ask the volunteers
to leave their pledges with Bill Barrett.

407
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,234
And thanks for coming and good night.

408
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,990
Let's all give our committee
a rising vote of confidence.

409
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,440
(Woman) Hollywood Victory Committee.

410
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,995
I'll connect you with the radio division.

411
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,874
The overseas division takes care of that, sir.

412

Bond drives? Mr Loal.

413

415
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,351
- I'd like to see a show, Mildred.
- Why don't you join the WAACs?

416
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,835
- I'm 4F. I got bunions.
- Where?

417
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,750
- Hollywood Victory Committee?
- Here's some calls to put through, girls.

418
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,640
Yes, Major, a show's there
Sunday the tenth.

419
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,115
Shows at ten, 2:30 and four.

420
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,312
- That's right, sir.
- Sorry, that's a commercial venture.

421
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,556
We can't charge servicemen.

422
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,672
Maxie Rosenbloom is here now.
I have his ticket.

423
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,315
- There you are, Mr Rosenbloom.
- Thanks.

424
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,438
Gee... Which end do I start from?

425
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,190
Mr Philips handles film entertainment.

426
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,472
His unit is shooting
at Twentieth Century Fox this morning.

427
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,991
- I'll give him your message.
- Joan Blondell will get in on Tuesday.

428
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,999
She wants to go to a Pacific base.
That's right.

429
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,512
We're not allowed to divulge
the base you'll go to.

430
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,392
That makes it all the more exciting.

431
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,955
I solemnly swear that I will not divulge
any military secrets...

432
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,751
Check with MGM and see if they'll postpone
the Hedy Lamarr picture so we can use her.

433
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,120
RKO just OK'd Cary Grant.

434
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,232
We'll hear from Paramount later
on Colbert and Dick Powell.

435
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,396
Oh, swell.

436
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
- Check Abbott and Costello.
- Right away.

437
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,953
The priority on Irene Dunne
has just come through.

438
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,990
Fine.

Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

Just in case you fellas don't know me,
I'm something left over from the last war.

sweethearts are being left behind

But I say to the girls to cheer up, girls

446
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,392

668
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,960
- You can count on us 100%.
- I was sure of that.

669
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,799
Oh, Tony, I missed Gloria tonight.

670
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,234
- Oh... She had an early call.
- Early call? She's between pictures.

671
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,436
Well...she's been pretty busy lately.

672
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,472
- I see. Well, good night.
- Good night.

673
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,995
- Did you find him?
- He wasn't at the club.

674
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,032
Well, try the studio again.

675
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,472
Never mind, Annie.

676
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,639
If Mr West should happen to call,
tell him I'm not in.

677
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,672
Yes, ma'am.

678
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,039
- Hollywood Victory Committee.
- Hollywood Victory Committee.

679
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,436
Yes, Mr West,
I have a call in for Orson Welles.

680
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,393
Just a minute. Here's Camp Scott.
Go ahead, Mr West.

681
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,638
Hello? Who?

682
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,672
Orson Welles. Just a moment.

683
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,036
Mr Welles, telephone!

684
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,833
- How do you work this thing?
- The other end.

685
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,673
Hello, Orson.
How's the weather down there?

686
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,919
I'm sorry, I can't give you that information.
That's a civilian secret.

687
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,749
How about moving your show
over to Camp Howard tomorrow?

688
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,918
Swell.

689
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,758
Thanks a million.

690
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,916
Orson Welles, Camp Howard tomorrow.

691
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,512
(Cheering and whistling)

692
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,239
That's the first time you ever saw
a rabbit take a magician out of a hat.

693
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,078
Oh, yardbird.

694
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,632
Uh-oh.

695
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,789
Your kind indulgence.
A miracle of the ancient East.

(Wolf-whistling)

697
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,632
For our next experiment,
we want two able-bodied,

698
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,070
open-minded,
clean-living young gentlemen

699
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,840
to assist us in sawing
Marlene Dietrich in half.

700
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,439
In the regulation method of sawing
the woman in half, the subject is...

701
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,836
- What is your name, sir? Meet Marlene.
- Fred.

702
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,872
..the subject is generally placed...

703
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,355
You don't have to make
anything special of it.

704
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,232
..in a wooden box for concealment.

705
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,078
We, however, do it the hard way.

706
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,514
Our torture chamber has been abbreviated.
Achmed, the wooden rompers.

707
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,916
Just try that on for size, Marlene.

708
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,240
My next selection.

709
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,272
Orson?

710
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,276
Mm-hm?

711
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,676
- We haven't rehearsed this.
- I'm sorry.

712
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,076
This is one trick you can't repeat.

713
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,956
Gentlemen, you ought to know
we lose a girl at every performance.

714
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,712
The turnover is tremendous.
You take this end, sir.

715
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,549
You take that end. Be very careful.
You might cut your fingers.

716
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:07,392
Now, the idea is
to just...saw Miss Dietrich in half.

719
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,236
- How does the trick work?
- Just wait. This'll kill you.

720
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,272

- Oh, Orson.
- Yes, Marlene.

737
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,872
I feel just the same as always.

738
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,719
Wait till you try to take a bow.

739
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,712
An announcement.
If you run into the Dietrich legs,

740
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,116
please ask them both
to come back to the tent.

741
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,597
They're wearing Marlene's
last pair of nylon stockings.

742
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,632
(Cheering and whistling)

743
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,438
- Orson.
- Hmm...

744
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,120
- How do I know these are my legs?
- Have no fear.

745
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,880
I will hypnotise her and she'll know.

746
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,360
Look me in the yolks of the eyes.

747
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,552
(Cheering and applause)

748
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,992
Hiya, Tony.

749
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,716
Did you send that script
to Charlie's house?

750
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,753
I delivered it to him personally.
I'm no fool.

751
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,552
What's the matter?

752
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,398
Nothing.

753
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,919
Tony, I know I'm only your sister

754
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,954
but when you married Gloria,
we sort of counted her in the family...

755
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,400
Forget it, Kitty.

756
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,229
I know you're not happy about
this separation and I'm sure she isn't.

757
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,751
- Why don't you call her?
- If Gloria wanted to hear from me...

758
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,474
Stop being stubborn. Call her up.

759
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,280
All right, Kitty. You win.

760
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,552
What do you mean I win?
You know you're glad I asked you to.

761
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,592

Hello.

01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,714
Oh, hello, Mr. West.

765
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,752
No, she is not in.

766
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,116
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.

767
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,352
She won't talk to you.
She's given me strict orders.

768
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,512
I'm sorry, sir. Goodbye.

769
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,511
There's one guy
I always know where to find.

770
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,519
- Hello, Walter.
- I'm going to dinner. Want to join me?

771
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,553
Sorry, I can't make it.
Got to be at a broadcast tonight.

772
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,752
- It's a Command Performance.
- When will we get together?

773
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,996
I've a lot of things to talk to you about.

774
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,478
I'm going out on a camp tour.
I won't be back for eight to ten weeks.

775
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,240
Well, drop me a line.
I'll see you when you get back.

776
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,272
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

777
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,679
Thank you and hiya, fellas,
this is Dinah Shore.

778
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,360
We dreamed up
another 4-0 Command Performance

779
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,960
and before they pry me loose
from the microphone,

780
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,198
I'm sending love to the Silver Dollar
gun crew at Dutch Harbor,

781
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,119
to Memphis Bill and his Seabees
in the South Pacific

782
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,949
and, by the way, I got myself quite
a case on those engineers down there,

783
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,435
where the skeeters buzz and chiggers chug.

784
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,030
Ditto to those leathernecks
and double ditto to all the rangers.

785
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,676

without music, so here I go.

958
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,472
Certainly. What is it?

959
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,477
I really hadn't planned to tell you, Kitty,

960
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,399
but I rather think somebody
in the family ought to know.

961
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,040

I would like to throw a handful
of credit where credit is due.

Bon voyage and the best of luck
on your trip overseas.

1076
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,513
This is Tom Hanlon speaking.

1077
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:14,352
- Hello, Gloria.
- Walter.

1078
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,118
- Did Annie tell you?
- Annie?

1079
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,949
She wouldn't tell her own mother
the time of day if you ordered her not to.

1080
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,196
Now I know what the FBI go through.

1081
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,752
- How's Tony?
- I haven't seen much of him.

1082
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,360
Nobody does
except the people he works with.

1083
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:36,552
He eats, sleeps and dreams camp shows.

1084
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,592
So I've heard.

1085
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,280
I understand he's going overseas.

1086
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:45,109
That's what he's been after
ever since the Army rejected him.

1087
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,958
Since what?

1088
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,596
Why, yes. He tried to enlist
the day after Pearl Harbor.

1089
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,439
- I didn't know that.
- Gloria...

1090
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,154
Do you think it's fair to keep this a secret?

1091
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,078
Where can I reach him?

1092
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:08,909
You might call Bill Barrett
at the Hollywood Victory Committee.

1093
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,993
Hello? Hello, Mrs West. How are you?

1094
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,680
I'm sorry but Mr West
has just left for overseas.

1095
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:47,911
Kids, I got the lowdown. We land tomorrow,
Australia, Brisbane. Are you packed?

1096
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,156
- I am.
- Well, I'm not.

1097
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,551
Would you mind throwing
my things in a bag?

1098
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,954
Sure.

1099
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,032
- Still feeling kinda low, eh, Tony?
- Kinda.

1100
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:02,232
I have a hunch
that all your moping's for nothing.

1101
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,840
I ran out of hunches
when she didn't say goodbye.

1102
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,872
There might be a good reason.

1103
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,996
I ran out of reasons too.

1104
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,872
You're still in love with Gloria, aren't you?

1105
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,913
I guess it doesn't make
much difference now.

1106
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:25,076
Tony, I'm gonna do something
I haven't done since the fourth grade.

1107
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,680
I'm gonna tell a tale out of school.

1108
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,509
I made a promise to Gloria
that I'm gonna have to break.

1109
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,520
What is it?

1110
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,032
She didn't come to the boat because
she's at Dr Wood's place in Sunland.

1111
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,676
Doc Wood? The baby doctor?
Why didn't she tell me?

1112
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:46,714
She hoped you'd come back because
you wanted to, not because of the baby.

1113
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,956
Of course I wanted to.
What did she think?

1114
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,152
- She wasn't sure.
- She will be soon. I'll cable her.

1115
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,352
No. I'll call her from Brisbane tomorrow.

- Yeah, get your stuff.

1138
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:44,278
They got a cargo ship last night
with a camp show unit aboard.

I've arranged for you two
to go with the search party.

All right.

Hold it!

01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,276
- Mr West?
- Yes. Any news about my son?

1143
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,277
- Not yet.
- They're still searching.

1144
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,676
They're waiting for you at the USO house.

1145
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,640
Yes, I heard it on the radio this morning.

1146
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,478
Does Mrs West know about it?

1147
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,513
No. I don't think it wise to tell her yet.

1148
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,476
Nurse, no newspapers.

1149
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,512
Yes, Doctor.

1150
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,358
Hello, Jim.

1151
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,000
Hello, Gloria. Are you feeling all right?

1152
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,477
Fine. What do you think of my son?

1153
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:44,309
I expect him to break into his dance
any minute, just like Tony.

1154
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,840
Any word from him?

1155
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,440
He's supposed to arrive in Brisbane tonight.

1156
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:57,232
Australia. It seems so far away.

1157
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,273
And yet somehow I feel terribly close to him.

1158
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,512
More so today than ever.

1159
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:20,760

- Hello, Gloria.

1160
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,160
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

1161
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,550
But how's the baby?
They tell me he's quite a boy.

1162
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,398
Yes, he's fine.

1163
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,473
But that isn't what I came
to talk to you about.

1164
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,480
This is the overseas symbol, isn't it?

1165
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:48,318
I'd like to go over as soon as possible.
