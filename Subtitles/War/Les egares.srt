1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Emmanuelle B¨¦art

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Gaspard Ulliel

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,993
Strayed

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,993
Andr¨¦ T¨¦chin¨¦

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why does it sound so fast?

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What is this monster with this good appetite? 

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's like the devil there

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes,the devil who can take away kids

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,993
But why does he take away those kids?

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,991
Alright?

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No,nothing,it's OK

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,993
I can wake your sister

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When did it rain?

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,993
Long before,I've been watching

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mom

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How are you doing?

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll take you to the grassplot to play

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I have to comb my hair first

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Philip,could you see if there's anyone who can take us there?

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Anyone who is as lost as we are?

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,993
If we have a map ,that'll be a lot easier

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are some villagers,but we have to pay them

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I stole a bottle

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,993
Do you need a bottle?

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is there just a little room for me?

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sorry,no

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Unless maybe at the back

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No,I have to take the kids

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's impossible

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I really hope that you can take me!

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why not taking him?

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Just like this,it will do

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But everyone is like this

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I can't be like this all the time

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Will we meet a lot of people like this on the road?

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We must change our plan,
it's a long road

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But hometown really upsets me

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm quite satisfied with their arrangement for the fifteen days

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,993
You don't have to be upset

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's a corner ahead

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,993
It's a little far from the national highway

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Look on your left

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
See if the baggages are falling down

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Can I sleep now?

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,991
I need a cigarette

47
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,991
philip

48
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why getting so far?!

49
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is just a begining!

50
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,993
We have to get far away their field of vision!

51
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,993
Why do you take off your skirt?

52
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,991
I wanna pee

53
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,993
It doesn't matter
You can go inside yourself

54
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,991
A duck-peak cap

55
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Can I order those animals?

56
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is fine

57
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You are on the road alone?

58
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Alone,yeah,it's a kind of saying

59
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But your family doesn't know?

60
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes,but if I died,they would be living a good life

61
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You came from there?

62
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes,I've been walking for the past ten days

63
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is not the end

64
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you want?

65
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just as everybody does

66
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And you?

67
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We too,we wanna get out here and go to Paris

68
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But Paris,is like a city

69
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It'll break you

70
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And then you will want to come back

71
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You,talking like that

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If we get through this village at night

73
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it will be very dangerous

74
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why dangerous?

75
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We should stay in the bosk

76
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,991
Good luck!

77
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Where are you going?

78
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
To find a place to sleep

79
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want to go with him

80
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Into the woods

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Listen to me ,Mum

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No,sit down

83
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You remind us that we can't be like this any more

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Go have a walk

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,993
For those things?

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Do as I said

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No,Mum,I'm really sorry

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I said he could help us

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He has a bosk

90
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,993
I'll be right back

91
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why have they all gone?

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
To find a place in the village for us to sleep

93
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What are the places with the stars?

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's just that we are sleeping in the nature

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like animals?

96
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,993
Yes,like animals

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Are you looking for me?

98
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes,I don't know your name yet

99
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
How do I call you?

100
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My name is Ewan

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Any more questions?

102
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Take me ,if you are leaving

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If those planes come again...

104
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been running too

105
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You have to learn to be on your own!

106
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You should do more exercises

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But how to exercise?

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is  different

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Will this fall down?Those Americans?

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Did your mum agree ?

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Obviously!

112
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You'd better tell me

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,993
Because your mother has to know about these

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you looking at?

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You should make a change in your life

116
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They are all over there

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,991
And then?

118
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We stopped seeking this time

119
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If I wanna seek,I will seek for a palace

120
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But you'd better be careful,don't go directly

121
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This will scare me?

122
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't follow me any more

123
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A bunch of freaks are coming to our country right away

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,991
Hold on!

125
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Take it

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,993
This will tell you the time

127
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But it's not for children

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's my dad's

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's from the Red Cross committee

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You like it?

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,993
Thank you,I like it very much

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What happened to your dad?

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
When the war has just started

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He was in a loft

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He fell down from the stairs

136
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and was badly hurt

137
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They wanted to find a man

138
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But when they wanted it back

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This will be stopped by the animals

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,993
We have corresponding methods

141
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You don't wanna sleep?

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There should be someone watching the fire

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,993
I can,I can't sleep now

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You are not cold?

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,993
You are sitting so far away

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,991
How old are you?

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,991
Seventeen

148
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When you are talking to me

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you have to watch your words

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry ,but...

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But I can't let people talk to me when I'm driving

152
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Those people are driving me crazy

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Be friendly,lady

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,993
If I sleep,I'll get my stuff

155
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
OK?

156
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Are you sleeping?

157
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,993
No,it's nothing

158
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Where are we going?

159
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I haven't seen that man,where did he go?

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He left,just like that

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why do you say so?

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't wanna explain these

163
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OK,let's go!

164
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What time is it now?

165
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't you have a watch?

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I lost it

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How? When?

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not sure

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Maybe I lost it when I was running

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But you should find it back

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You should never waste money like this!

172
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It looks like I'll never have the chance to find it back!

173
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What can I do
since you tell me you've lost it

174
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but you can't find it back,son!

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
OK,what do you wanna ask me?

176
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Listen,if you lie to me like everybody else

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We are going back to that road!

178
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We are stronger!

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is more obvious

180
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Where did you go?

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I find a house
but it's a little far

182
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The landlord is quite hospitable

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He gave me lots of things

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Check it out

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Did you see a village by the corner?

186
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A village that is slaughtered

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Would you like something to eat?

188
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He found a household

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Have something

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,993
And take some for your sister

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
With his company,we set out

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Emilia's husband left at the same time

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,993
He didn't sleep,but was still leading the way for us

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,993
It's all because of him that we slept so well last night

195
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,993
Let's take a rest here

196
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,991
Just over there

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you have a pocket?

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For the food? Yes

199
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No

200
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You come,and I'll look for it

201
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Where are you going?

202
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,991
I'll be right back

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This body has been here very long
The face has already got rottened

204
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and moldy

205
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,993
I have no idea of what was on their mind when they were in trouble

206
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
OK,right there

207
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Get in quickly

208
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You just got in like this?

209
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But it's always like this when you are outside

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mum

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,991
I'm scared of the wolves

212
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Maybe it's what you felt last night

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't worry ,we'll be here the whole summer

214
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If there's wolves

215
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Put me down

216
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh,you don't have shoes

217
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let me take care of that

218
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I've never seen such a beautiful house

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I like here very much

220
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What?

221
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh,this is exactly the opposite

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Maybe no one will ever feel Paris

223
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Listen,do what you wanted to do

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
or you'll go back home
and when we need your help

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,993
we'll give you a call

226
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you have a cigarette?

227
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
This is my last one

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We can share if you don't mind

229
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,993
No,thanks,I'm OK

230
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,993
Don't you wanna look after the kids?

231
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
OK,maybe you have your reason,I'll be listening

232
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know how to say this

233
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's OK

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Why would it be OK?

235
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,993
You must have questions if you know

236
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,993
What are you doing?! Get down!

237
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He's really tough

238
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Are you afraid?

239
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No, I don't think so

240
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,993
I don't think this has anything to do with danger
that's it

241
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Why don't you take a bath like he does?

242
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,992
This is generally for girls

243
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Mum,what are you doing?

244
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,993
Nothing,I want a rest
I don't feel like going

245
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Philippe chose a room,you too

246
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What about me?

247
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You sleep with me

248
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This is really a big house
Yes

249
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
A big house

250
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Mum

251
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What?

252
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,991
I'm hungry

253
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But I didn't take anything with me

254
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Or you can let me stay and tell you a story?

255
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
No,thanks,I wanna be out

256
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,993
To find boys

257
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh,this is hard as stone

258
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,993
No,just a little bit

259
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We shouldn't be so unruly when we are hungry

260
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But why cheese?

261
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Because that's all we've found

262
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
We'll pass this

263
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,993
I'll be sorry this way

264
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Don't be.
But if the kids don't wanna eat,we'll save it

265
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Then you have it

266
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,991
and that's final

267
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Um,this is all the same to me

268
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I like here
Are we staying long?

269
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,993
We'll sleep here until we find another village

270
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I wanna tell you that we can't quarter at the village

271
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We should find a phone,immediatelly

272
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
We have to do this

273
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But I don't have anything else to do

274
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Take care of the kids on the road

275
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
We have to be like that

276
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't talk about this in front of the kids

277
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Just as always,the war has already started

278
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
He have a point

279
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Not at all

280
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It doesn't make any sense that the kids should protect them

281
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Adaults should protect them,too

282
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But adaults are different

283
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,993
They are not always that simple

284
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,993
It would be better if there's a bottle of wine

285
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,993
Good idea

286
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What time is it now?

287
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is unbelievable,we can't say

288
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I say it's six

289
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Where did dad's watch go?

290
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's lost

291
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's lost on the road

292
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,993
When you are on your way back,you may find it

293
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't understand

294
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Pick some if you will

295
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
May I take a look at what you have picked?

296
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,993
Take it back
this is champine for the morning

297
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This is champine for the morning
That'll be all right,too

298
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is this easily drunk?

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,993
What kind of wine is this?

300
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You take it

301
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Anything wrong?

302
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,991
Nothing

303
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,991
Yvan!

304
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What are you doing there?

305
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,991
I'm waiting

306
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Do you think he will be back?

307
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Maybe not now

308
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We should be good to the foreigners

309
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and be faithful

310
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He probably won't be back any more

311
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you know what is the really rank between you?

312
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We should be positive

313
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What are you trying to say?

314
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I feel cold here

315
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I looked for trousers
but they are all the kids' size

316
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,991
Silly

317
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Come on
Lean on me

318
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Your heart is like my bed

319
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Did you wanna cry just now?

320
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
On the road

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I've been like this the whole night

322
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,993
Why are you afraid of telling me?

323
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You don't have to be afraid

324
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yes

325
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You know that you can tell me

326
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
There is nothing to be afraid of

327
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No,nothing

328
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll tell you next time

329
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
when we feel this again

330
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,991
Promise me

331
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,991
I'm tired

332
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Where are we going?

333
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't know where can we go

334
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We have to find a place where we can rest

335
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Give me
You wanna something to drink?

336
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No,thanks

337
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No,you have to drink

338
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,991
You too

339
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Do you wanna know who came to the house?

340
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Where is the village?

341
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
What shall we do?

342
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,991
Keep on going

343
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,991
German!

344
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm very scared of these planes

345
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Me too,I'm scared too

346
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm also scared but I didn't tell you

347
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,993
Why didn't you say?

348
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Nobody wants to be in a wasteland like this

349
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't want to,either

350
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Maybe we are afraid of the wolves

351
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
We can't have a day like that yet

352
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It'll be OK if we are finished

353
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Just take this as an exercise

354
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
More importantly,I don't wanna one thing leads to another

355
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The safety problem?

356
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,993
I£¬I can't sleep under the stars

357
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Did you go to the German's?

358
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes,I borrowed it from the enemy

359
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I've never seen these before

360
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Here is safety pin

361
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It will explode without this

362
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
What are you doing?

363
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,991
Nothing

364
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,991
Don't you forget

365
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Where did you find this?

366
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This is something for you

367
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm asking you,Yvan

368
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Are these stolen?

369
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I pick them on the road

370
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
from someone that is still alive

371
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Go back to your room

372
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,993
But I think I'll know more if I stay in here

373
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
At Paris

374
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The army is under too much pressure to stay inside the city

375
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Or it depends on the opinions from the capitol of France

376
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,993
Will leaving be better?

377
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,993
Are you uncomfortable?

378
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What did you do to my stuff?

379
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I put them away from the bed
you fell down last night

380
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Did you take my clothes off?

381
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No,it's billy,he took them off

382
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You OK? Not that tired?

383
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,991
I'm OK

384
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Do you always sleep like this?

385
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Just as you know,I sleep easily

386
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Maybe you'll think I'm falling down like a dead man

387
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Did you lock my gun?

388
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We'll stay later

389
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
OK,I'll get another plate
Then we can have dinner

390
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Oh,it's a little weird

391
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's not fit at all

392
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Go find a stool

393
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This won't be too heavy for you

394
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I don't wanna say yes!

395
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
When I'm thirteen,I'm already grown up

396
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Is this a good cancellation?

397
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Who else wanna come?

398
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
A great man who you don't know

399
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,993
Everybody is interested in this

400
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Why did you finish the wine?

401
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,991
I'll go look for it.

402
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Tell me that you are not oppose of answering me.

403
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Why you cut your hair like this?

404
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,993
This is because it will make me feel more comfortable.

405
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Where is my gun?

406
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
When u leave the house I will give it back to you.

407
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,993
What else you need to say?

408
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,991
Give me.

409
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Mom, I want jam.

410
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We already finish eating, that was the last bottle.

411
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You sit over there.

412
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay

413
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,991
eat slowly

414
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Isn't there someone else thats coming?

415
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We have no responsibility on that small car right?

416
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,991
The chicken is good.

417
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I like the one you cook.

418
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,993
This doesn't belong here.
419
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
One more time.I'm reporting a news about a missing kid.

420
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We need this news

421
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Outstand its purpose

422
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,991
Listen first

423
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We found four kids, number 39

424
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This is little monick tesi 's only life

425
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,993
-H-E-I-N-H-Y

426
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,993
When he got lost he is only 10 . he borned at Gerkabi

427
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He is missing on Sunday May 17th

428
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
During a war time

429
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He was with his father at that time

430
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
We didn't pay attention on the kid that time

431
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We hope there's someone with him

432
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And took him back to the capital

433
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The kid was missing for around four years

434
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He has gold hair

435
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Blue eyes

436
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Wear glasses

437
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,991
Straight teeth

438
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
No other outstanding information

439
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But he wears a headphone

440
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,991
And a necklace

441
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,993
This is the kid we are looking for, number 39

442
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,993
Now is the kid number 40

443
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,993
This is little shark. born in okando

444
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You see i caught three fishes

445
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This is the forgivenss that gave to us for the famine

446
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You are really a great engineer!

447
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
What you mean by engineer?

448
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,993
It's a very smart person

449
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Why you think they are smart?

450
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Why you think this way?

451
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Beacuse i think you will pass the test,Evonnue

452
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
This is no joke right?

453
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I will give some commands then you can protect them.

454
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm tough enough to handle myself

455
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's a helping hand

456
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
No. i will hlp you

457
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That's great

458
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Why?

459
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Why you ask why? why, no reason.

460
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because I am afraid of death

461
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I hope everybody lives

462
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Because i am a civilized person

463
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So then there is no other need?

464
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
After that where are you planning to go?

465
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I only want a garden

466
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What kind of garden?

467
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You go out, i'm busy

468
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I want a clean house

469
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,993
And open some can

470
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I could also comfort kids

471
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I said that already,Evonnue

472
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,993
After you leave i will come back

473
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Is all girls like this?

474
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But to us it's like this

475
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,993
But I will let the kids recognize these

476
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But I don't understand you

477
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Reseach is a normal way to protect self

478
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But you are not a law

479
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But maybe it's you!

480
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You are a king then i have to hide in the garden

481
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,991
This is not the conditions

482
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
These are the disagreement conditions

483
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,991
You can leave

484
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You are too nervous!

485
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But can you give me back my gun?

486
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I need to take it back

487
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Listen,Evonnue

488
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I don't need to look after the door for you

489
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
This is your decision

490
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If you want then you could leave

491
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
If you want to live with us

492
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You have to follow our living rules, understand?

493
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't understand the same thing as yours

494
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Can you clearly finish the left over information?

495
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I wish you could stay too

496
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But the kids like you very much

497
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They just say they want to eat the fish together

498
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I help you is anything

499
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Are you interested in me?

500
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,993
Yeah, your personality

501
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's hard for me to straight this

502
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You too?

503
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,993
Yeah, me too

504
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,991
Do you have cigarette?

505
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,993
Yeah, in my pant's pocket you can get it yourself

506
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,989
I'll be back soon

507
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He only bring back these this time?

508
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I cannt fall asleep ,i want find out what 

509
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't know what this symbol means

510
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,993
These groups are all in sake of earning living

511
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Listen to his writing

512
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Over there it let me understand, what women needs

513
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's not of love

514
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's of power, to dominate those powers

515
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Stop, mother

516
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I dont interset in that

517
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Feels like the first thing....

518
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm not taking about that

519
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's when we are alive we need to understand

520
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You are going to sleep?

521
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,993
You know that as a same problem, there is no need of having a different idea

522
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Do you think this is a law?

523
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
There is no investigation

524
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,993
This is blank,did you find it?

525
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm just telling you

526
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is mighty

527
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,993
When I am alone

528
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I want to sleep with you

529
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Where is your mother?

530
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,993
They all went out

531
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'll go look for them

532
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I only want to stay with you

533
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
There will be no setback to mother right here

534
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
If i am not here

535
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
She will feel very comfortable

536
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You too

537
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Will you feel cheerful?

538
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's not like that

539
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,991
Look

540
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What are still doing?

541
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What did you do in the streets?

542
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,991
Then that's it

543
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Then i am like that too

544
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
That's it

545
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
This need to change, i will give you guys a explanation

546
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Like the others, don't know what to explain

547
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We will continue living like this

548
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
We will go crazy

549
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000

Yes, why don't you  listen to me?

560
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I don't want to tell!

561
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,993
Your not going to know, go

562
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,991
I've find her

563
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Didn't take good care of your sister

564
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What is your mother doing?

565
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,991
She falls asleep

566
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Don't tell her about nonsence

567
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Do you feel confuse?

568
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
No, this is nothing

569
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Confusing

570
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We need to face a lot like this in Paris

571
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
If it was a short time for you guys to get there

572
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
If you guys believe the women in the streets

573
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,991
Shit

574
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Evounne

575
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Can I go with you?

576
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
No problem

577
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
How far?

578
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Around six

579
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Maybe we will have some luck

580
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I want to ask

581
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
How do you choose locations?

582
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like a pedestrian

583
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Should have to walk in the "tree branch root"

584
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
After that we can find the crack on the hole

585
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Ok start hurry up

586
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,993
I found something

587
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Now I can eat what ever i want

588
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
What is this

589
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,991

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
How you do that?

591
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Your parents are from country side?

592
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I dont have parents

593
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You mean they all dead?

594
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000

595
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I dont like to remind them

596
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
When someone ask a question like this

597
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
This way I will be very stupid

598
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The way you talk make u lost your faith

599
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000

601
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000

Our father hope that we are stronger

906
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That we should realize the outside world clearly

907
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Let me be a powerful man

908
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Be a real frenchman

909
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000

They will defense themselves

915
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
You should face what i said

916
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Not all the people behave like you

917
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,993
Don't do that

918
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,991
Check up the time

919
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I'm gonna have a rest, 
then we get together here again

920
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It's 13:35 now

921
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I wanna take a walk

922
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,993
It's too sensitive

923
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You made me like this

924
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
We are both lost

925
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,991
Why?

926
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,993
May try it often

927
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,991
Are you allright?

928
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Didn't you kill them all?

929
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I don't mean to hurt you 

930
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,993
but you have realized your confidence

931
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
You should know how to fight back

932
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,991
if somebody like him moves in

933
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,991
I don't want to know

934
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
They try to find the gun

935
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,993
But I hide it, then There's no conflict

936
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
but I have no other choice

937
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
There is always an odd idea in my head

938
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,993
You don't face the problem by yourself

939
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
We should never stay here anymore

940
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,993
Tell your mom that we are going to leave

941
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Don't miss anything

942
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
This is very necessary to me

943
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Why you like to keep those bottles?

944
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
You should share it with us

945
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
They are from your area

946
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,991
It seems not

947
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,993
Came here alone, then go to Duca

948
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Open it, taste it

949
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
We climbed on the truck

950
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
No enough room for everyone

951
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Then when we got there

952
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Dismiss all of them

953
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
No one knows it, no one get the property

954
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Together with Robert

955
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,993
To that place 250km far away

956
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,991
Yvan

957
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,991
Yvan

958
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
We are not clear why we stay here tonight

959
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's ok even if we changed

960
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
There will be this kind of lucky

961
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Never mind, It must be Yvan who did this

962
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
He is usually not present

963
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Why does he not be here?

964
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Yvan

965
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Couse he don't want to meet so many people

966
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
He don't like that

967
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
What's your job?

968
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I run a winebar

969
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
near the coast of Nice

970
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Oh, I don't know there

971
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
We used to spend holidays in Black Crist

972
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
My dad prefers to monntains

973
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
This is not a good manner ...

974
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
to judge Father like this

975
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
This is not correct

976
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Couse I like to say  this

977
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
When will dad come back?

978
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Maybe in May

979
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Don't be crap

980
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,991
I want more

981
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Finish the dishes first

982
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Don't be wasting

983
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Why doesn't he have dinner with us?

984
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It's too late

985
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Maybe he is sick

986
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
He has a little stage fright

987
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
What does it mean?

988
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It means he doesn't like to 
stay with a lot of people

989
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
But it's not necessay today

990
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Have you been to school?

991
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
3 years

992
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
You didn't mention it before

993
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Can I tell you this later?

994
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I, a singer

995
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
What kind of?

996
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Opera

997
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Sometime I can hold it perfectly

998
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But sometime not before the show

999
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Can you sing for us?

1000
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
NO, no, it's allright

1001
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I don't wanna sing at dinner time

1002
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I can sing before all the people

1003
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,993
Why you think you are shy?

1004
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
You said you have known Germany for 100 years?

1005
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yes, and which disturbed me

1006
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yes

1007
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,993
Do something else

1008
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Why doesn't he come in?

1009
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's desolate outside

1010
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
You insist to following us?

1011
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's very natural

1012
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Really?

1013
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Why?

1014
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
He told me your first thing to do 
is reading and writing

1015
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And there was another reason before

1016
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I can't tell them stories with good imagination

1017
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
You are a good mother

1018
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Absolutely, but you made it at last

1019
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,991
good

1020
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,993
Or it's time to say "Goodbye"

1021
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Sorry, I shouldn't come to bother you 

1022
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But we are still in jet lag

1023
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Is this the first time for you being here?

1024
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
We stay here to avoid ...

1025
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
the dangrous animals

1026
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Animals have their habits

1027
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But it's deceptive

1028
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It doesn't mean this is fire

1029
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
If we insist, it's ok

1030
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
But if not, it will be different

1031
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And me, I can't say it to men

1032
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I can't deceive others

1033
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I have no friends like others

1034
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,993
Yes, very little

1035
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
And the condition prohibits

1036
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,991
I don't know

1037
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Get in 

1038
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Telephone

1039
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
There is your platform

1040
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,993
My time passed by

1041
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
since I came here

1042
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I began to take care someone
Maybe for myself

1043
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,993
I am a little selfish

1044
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Why not with your husband?

1045
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
He was shot at the beginning of the war

1046
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
That day I lost my bright future

1047
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,993
And it will never come back again

1048
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I saw a black tree

1049
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
A white document said to me

1050
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I am not like before

1051
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I am closer, for my husband

1052
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
He is there, and told me that

1053
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
If there isn't that consign

1054
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I will not see the bright for a long time

1055
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I understand

1056
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Have a rest

1057
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Maybe you know my reason

1058
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
and think i am reasonable

1059
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Sure

1060
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,991
This is what I should do

1061
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,991
Here

1062
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
My whole family

1063
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
You was not on it

1064
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,993
I was taking the picture

1065
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Sorry, I should stay with you,

1066
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But I am so sleepy

1067
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And we get up early tomorrow morning

1068
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Maybe I will go home

1069
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Wait

1070
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Good luck

1071
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Really?

1072
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,991
Give me a hug

1073
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
What are you doing?

1074
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,993
I wanna feel a woman

1075
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I have been long for this for a long time

1076
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
But is it too fast?

1077
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Don't say that

1078
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,993
You understand me?

1079
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Why do you do that?

1080
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Is this what I know?

1081
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,993
I don't know

1082
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,993
Shall I stop?

1083
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Don't you want to come back now?

1084
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I don't want to see them, but they are leaving

1085
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I just stay here today

1086
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
They told me the war was end

1087
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I know this

1088
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Do you have any plan?

1089
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Since you don't want to leave

1090
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yes, it's normal

1091
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You want to go where he stayed, and then Paris

1092
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Where else?

1093
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,991
I am  hungry

1094
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I have no bread yet
and there is none of it

1095
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Foolish

1096
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And take your cooking art with you 

1097
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,993
Send away the soldiers, ok?

1098
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Hello, Madame

1099
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,991
Hello

1100
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,993
Do you know him?

1101
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,993
Yes or no?

1102
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,993
This is our friend

1103
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
My friend left the house

1104
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
He want to take back 4 of them

1105
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
At that time, a men dressing like him...

1106
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
beat him with a rung

1107
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
What are you thinking?

1108
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
He opened a door at the corner

1109
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Is he the first man who came in the house?

1110
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
No, he was hiding somewhere

1111
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But he has double guilts

1112
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Others has been awake to this

1113
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
When we met this young man

1114
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
We wrote a certificate

1115
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
He can't leave here

1116
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,993
We moved in from the outside

1117
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
He saved us and found a house for us

1118
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
How did he find it?

1119
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It's 23

1120
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Haven't you suspect her method?

1121
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
No, the windows were all closed

1122
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
How long have you been here?

1123
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I don't konw

1124
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Ok, we will record this

1125
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,993
And the whole thing

1126
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,993
We are considering this

1127
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
To me, it was 14th of June

1128
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,993
It's a pity that I have never
seen anything artificial 

1129
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,991
Thanks

1130
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Still the same time to here?

1131
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You can spend everyday like this

1132
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Look, this is Lulu, right?

1133
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
It's not the time to play

1134
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,991
Sit here

1135
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,991
Lulu

1136
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,991
Lulu

1137
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Why not eat something?

1138
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I don't want to eat

1139
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Don't scratch

1140
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It's not there

1141
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Don't be so nervous

1142
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,993
This place made me nervous

1143
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Together with you?

1144
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,993
Can I talk to you ?

1145
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Can I go with you ?

1146
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
No, you stay here

1147
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
It will not take you long

1148
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It's about that boy we catched 

1149
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Do you know his name?

1150
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't know

1151
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Don't you like him?

1152
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
No

1153
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I have never liked him

1154
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,993
That's it

1155
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Sorry, you have to stay here

1156
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,991
This way

1157
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
This is so strange to me

1158
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
He insisted even after he was injured

1159
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,991
He has a lot

1160
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Haven't he talk to you something?

1161
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Do we have a lot?

1162
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
No

1163
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Immigration

1164
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
He helped us in this way

1165
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Does this mean anything?

1166
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
NO

1167
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,991
I am sorry

1168
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
This makes you hard to recall

1169
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
How long will he be kept here?

1170
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
He has no politic power now

1171
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
He will be imprisoned for whole life

1172
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,993
Do you want to see him?

1173
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
When?

1174
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Tonight, No more details

1175
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,993
If someone come, I will inform you 

1176
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
When can I see him?

1177
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
There's no way to keep the prisoners

1178
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
It won't take to certificate

1179
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Where do you want to come in from?

1180
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It's none of my business

1181
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
you should find a survey

1182
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
But if you have no ID

1183
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Need my accompanying?

1184
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,991
NO

1185
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,993
Ok, see you later

1186
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
What are you doing  there?

1187
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Nothing

1188
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
What did they said about Yvan?

1189
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Yes, he escaped from the prison sucessfully

1190
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,993
We'd better never talk abou him

1191
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,993
And he is far away

1192
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Where is your sister?

1193
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,991
She is there

1194
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,991
Three

1195
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,991
Six

1196
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,991
Four

1197
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,991
Five

1198
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,993
The End
