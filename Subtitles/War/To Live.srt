The 1940s

18
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,800
You've lost again.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Not one lucky toss all night.

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,300
Chalk it up.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,300
How much?

22
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,800
Chunsheng.

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,100
I've run up a pile of debts lately.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,100
But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,100
Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,600
But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,100
They're too tired. Been at it all night.

28
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,800
Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

29
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,600
Business is good, Mr. Xie.

30
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,500
Come often. You're always welcome.

31
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,700
Old Man Heaven

32
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,300
Don't make it so late

33
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,500
Me and my lover

34
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,900
want more time

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,100
To frolic in our great big bed

36
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,900
Long'er, you're nearly there.

37
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
One more night like this...

38
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,000
you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Sure there's no mistake?

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Look at the records.

41
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,100
Master Fugui is going home. You take him.

42
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,400
Take care.

43
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Take care, Master.

44
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,400
Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Dad!

46
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,700
Degenerate! Another night gambling!

47
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,200
A dog's gotta eat shit! Little bastard!

48
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,600
If you don't stop...

49
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,000
we'll lose the little we have.

50
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Aren't you capable of anything else?

51
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Is gambling all you know?

52
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,600
Of all you could have learned, bastard!

53
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Little bastards from big bastards grow.

54
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
I learned all I know from you.

55
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,600
How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,800
You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

57
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,300
Will you cut it out?

58
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,700
- What'd he just say?
- Nothing. Eat.

59
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

60
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Grandpa's cursing you again.

61
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,500
He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
You're up.

63
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,300
What's wrong?

64
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,700
Don't cry.

65
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,100
It's not good for the baby.

66
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,600
You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,100
Who was gambling? I went to watch.

68
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
What are you crying for?

69
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,900
If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,600
Let me wipe your tears.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

72
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,900
All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,300
Fugui...

74
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,400
I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,500
Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,600
It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,600
Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

78
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

80
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
Please.

81
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,100
Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,300
Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,100
Tell me.

85
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,500
Your win, Master Fugui.

86
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,400
My luck's changed.

87
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Write that down. Another round.

88
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,800
Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
What are you doing here?

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,100
Well?

91
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,700
Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

92
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,500
No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,700
This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,400
Go home, go.

95
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,500
It's settled.

96
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,700
Mr. Xie...

97
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,500
get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm...

98
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Of course.

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,900
Master Fugui, you lost.

100
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
Let's roll!

101
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,000
Master Fugui.

102
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,900
Come, give Mrs. Xu a seat.

103
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,100
Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Come home.

105
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,700
Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,600
You want to make me lose face? Go away!

109
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,600
Get out!

110
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,100
I've just...

111
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
Let's play!

112
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,600
Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Get out of my sight!

114
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Go!

115
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,100
Let's roll!

116
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,200
Well?

117
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,000
Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

118
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,300
You've lost everything.

119
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,100
What do you mean?

120
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,800
You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,700
You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
What is it?

123
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,300
Master Fugui must settle his account.

124
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,000
It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,200
Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,800
for leaving you homeless.

127
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,400
But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,100
See you there in a few days.

129
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,500
You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,300
The game's not over yet!

131
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,600
Master Fugui, I'm sorry...

132
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

133
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,700
If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

134
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,600
This can't be happening!

135
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,900
What are you doing?

136
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,000
It's not over yet!

137
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,100
Sit down.

138
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,800
- Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

139
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,000
- Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,800
What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

142
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
I'll stake my life.

143
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,500
Don't talk like that.

144
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Anyway, your life's worth little now.

145
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,200
Not that we'd accept it as ante.

146
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,700
We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,400
and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,300
Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,500
We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,100
Okay?

151
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Your wife's been waiting for ages.

152
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Fugui...

153
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,200
I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
I've realized...

155
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,600
you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,900
I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,000
If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,800
I won't let him be like you.

159
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,600
Master Fugui, I'll take you.

160
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,300
- What are you doing?
- Master Fugui.

161
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,200
I have nothing left.

162
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,800
63, 73, 83...

163
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

164
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,900
No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,400
enough to settle Fugui's debt?

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Good.

168
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,600
A gambling debt's a debt,
and debts must be paid.

169
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,900
Everyone's here today.

170
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,400
So let's do what must be done.

171
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,200
The Xu family home...

172
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,500
And the debt is hereby settled.

174
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,300
Both sides must sign.

175
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,700
I thought I'd live my final days here.

176
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,200
Fugui.

177
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,300
Turtle spawn! I'll kill him!

178
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,300
I'll cut him into pieces! I'll clobber him!

179
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll never forgive you!

180
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,700
I'll never forgive you!

181
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,400
I want him dead!

182
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,400
Sir!

183
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,800
It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,100
Don't break anything!

186
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,600
Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,800
I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,100
Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,600
Want me to help you?

190
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
Needles and threads for sale!

191
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
Granny!

192
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,200
Jiazhen.

194
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,300
Come look at your son.

195
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,700
He looks like you.

196
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,500
No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,300
What's his name?

198
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,500
"Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,600
He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Who chose that name?

201
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Me.

202
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,300
Very good, very good.

203
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,300
I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,300
I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,300
Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,400
I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

207
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Youqing, excellent.

208
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,100
Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

209
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,700
I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,600
Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,900
and live peacefully.

213
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,900
I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,400
It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,800
I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

216
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,500
Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,400
Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

218
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,600
Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,300
but she needs a doctor.

220
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
We'll work something out.

221
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,800
I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

222
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,500
Life won't be easy.

223
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,700
Don't say that.

224
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,600
All I ask is a quiet life together.

225
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,100
A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,200
Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

227
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,100
Just call me Fugui.

228
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,000
This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Great at any price.

231
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,700
Have a seat.

233
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,200
I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

234
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,200
"Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,000
You mocking me?

236
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,600
No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,800
Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,200
We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,200
I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,400
I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,300
They are fabulous.

246
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,700
My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,900
It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm lucky to be alive

249
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Me and my lover want more time

250
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,400
To frolic on our great big bed

251
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,000
Come out!

252
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Come on! Get a move on!

253
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,800
1949: Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army
is losing the civil war.

254
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,900
The Communists under Mao Zedong
are poised to take over China.

255
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So we're fighting the Communists.

256
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Might never go home again.

257
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,600
What are you looking at?

258
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,300
Thinking of escaping?

259
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,600
The Nationalists will shoot you.

260
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,900
Besides...

261
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,300
troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,000
If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,600
But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,900
Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
As for me...

266
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,100
if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,500
Chunsheng, you really are mad.

268
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,200
I'd die happy if I could drive.

269
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,900
As for me...

270
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,300
I want to live. There's nothing like family.

271
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,000
One, two, three. One, two, three.

272
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
This case is in the way!

273
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,800
Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,200
Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,400
Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,600
It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,000
They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

278
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,400
What's that sound?

280
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,600
The wounded.

281
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
They're freezing.

282
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,000
No one's left.

284
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

285
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,800
Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,300
Take this.

287
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
- Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

288
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
Which corpses?

289
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,300
The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,500
Put it on. We must survive.

291
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,200
Lao Quan, have a drink.

292
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,600
It really is booze!

293
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,000
Was it from some dead officer?

294
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,500
Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,000
You've looked after us.

296
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,300
We must help each other.

297
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,100
Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,600
Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,500
I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
What happened? No one's left?

301
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
They've all run off.

302
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,600
How could that be?

303
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,400
The Reds must be on the attack.

304
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,600
What?

305
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,800
- Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

306
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Home!

307
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,300
Home?

308
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,100
Wait right here.

309
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,300
Run now...

310
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,900
and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,100
Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,500
The Reds send POWs home.

313
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
So, no running?

314
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,200
That's right.

315
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,900
You want to go home, don't run.

316
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,700
They won't shoot us?

317
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,000
Not as long as you've got your hands up.

318
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,200
How?

319
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,600
This will do the trick?

320
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,100
Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Do that and you're dead.

322
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,300
The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,500
Just put those hands up.

324
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,700
- The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

325
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,000
Chunsheng!

326
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,900
Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,700
Fugui...

328
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,900
we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,700
And live a good life.

330
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,400
Lao Quan! They're shooting!

331
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,000
Where did you find this coat?

332
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,900
- On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

333
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,000
The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
- What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

335
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,000
What's your brother look like?

336
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,500
Just like me.

337
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,300
Lao Quan!

338
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,300
The enemy's secret weapon

339
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,100
wounded me

340
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,600
I gather my troops

341
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,200
and we run for our lives

342
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,100
Fengxia!

343
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,700
It's your daddy.

344
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,000
What are you doing?

345
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,300
Where's mommy?

346
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,200
I'm home.

347
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,300
Home.

348
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,900
Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,900
The day...

350
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,400
we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,100
Suppose I was singing for her, too.

352
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,900
kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
You should have written.

355
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,300
Written?

356
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,000
I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,200
I thought of you...

358
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,100
all the time and worried...

359
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,800
how you were getting by.

360
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,300
The new government
paid for mother's burial...

361
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,800
and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm up before dawn.

363
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,100
Everyone wants water.

364
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,600
The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,900
It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,300
They never get...

367
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,000
a good night's sleep.

368
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,200
How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
She was fine when I left.

370
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,900
She can't even say "Daddy."

371
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,700
In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,200
For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,500
No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,100
When the fever came down...

375
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,300
she'd lost her voice.

376
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,800
You're here.

377
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,300
Fugui's back.

378
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,800
This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

379
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,800
So you're our leading cadre.

380
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,600
- I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,600
I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,500
Look at this.

383
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,500
He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,500
You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,900
I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

386
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,200
That's taking part.

387
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,800
You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

388
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,100
He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,700
We won't see him for a while.

390
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,300
Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,600
to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,100
Come along and get an education.

393
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,700
What did Long'er do?

394
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,100
Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

395
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,700
But it's not just that.

396
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,400
The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,300
He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,200
and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,400
Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

400
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,700
He burnt it?

401
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,600
It burnt for days.

402
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,900
Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,700
That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

404
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,900
Counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,200
Of course. You're you, he's him.

406
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,500
Execute the revolutionary despot, Long'er!

407
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:11,600
To the execution ground!

408
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,900
We will crush the counterrevolution!

409
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,900
Crush the counterrevolution!

410
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,600
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

411
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,900
Long live the Communist Party!

412
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,900
Long live the People's Government!

413
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Long live Chairman Mao!
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

414
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,300
Build a new China!

415
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,600
What's wrong?

416
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Why are your pants wet?

417
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,800
Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,900
They shot him.

419
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,700
They shot Long'er?

420
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,100
Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,500
He is dead.

422
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,700
If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,500
that'd have been me.

424
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
What class do we belong to?

425
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,900
Landlords?

426
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,100
Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

427
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,100
Not landlords.

428
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,400
Ordinary townspeople.

429
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,100
Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,300
- What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,400
- In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,500
Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,100
Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,000
Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,200
Of course.

436
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,400
Poor townspeople.

437
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,800
It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,000
Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,500
I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,200
Good idea!

441
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,900
The 1950s

442
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,400
1958: Mao Zedong launches
the "Great Leap Forward."

443
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,300
Steel production is now targeted
at 10.7 million tonnes per year.

444
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,900
Every household donates its iron utensils.

445
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,700
Take a break.

446
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,400
Tired?

447
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,000
Fugui!

448
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,700
Our family's turn to donate iron.

449
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,800
It's ready.

450
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,100
It's all here?

451
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,500
Keep these.

452
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,300
To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,300
Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,000
We'll take these.

455
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,500
If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

456
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,800
We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,800
We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,100
When you're hungry...

459
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,900
just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,100
There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,700
Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,800
Yes, there is!

463
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,600
But that's wood.

464
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,300
There's metal on it.

465
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,100
And here are pins.

466
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,000
It can't be worth much.

467
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,600
We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,100
It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,900
We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,100
So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,600
The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,900
You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,600
and after that...

474
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,800
they captured two mountains a day.

475
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,300
I see your point.

476
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,600
All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,400
We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,100
You can leave those.

479
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,000
We won't touch them.

480
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,600
We're off to the next house.

481
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,600
We are not going to liberate Taiwan?

482
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,500
Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,000
Take that!

484
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,300
- Enough?
- No!

485
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,200
Enough?

486
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,400
Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

487
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,000
Big ambition for a little kid.

488
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,300
It's more than enough.

489
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,300
So gobble away. Help yourself to sauces.

490
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,700
Youqing, I'll help you stir that up.

491
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,500
What a big appetite!

492
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,100
And so much chili sauce!

493
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,700
That's a big bowl, Youqing.

494
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,200
Give it to us if you can't finish.

495
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,600
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,300
How could you?

497
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,000
Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,900
What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,400
What is this?

500
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,300
Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

501
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,400
This is too much.

502
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,900
- Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,500
Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,400
This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,000
We don't know what's going on.

506
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,900
Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,300
It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,400
And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,700
That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,200
Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,900
Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,700
Now!

513
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,800
I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,200
- Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,500
- Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,300
- I'm telling you to go!
- No!

517
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,500
You won't go?

518
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Don't hit him!

519
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,600
Leave him alone! I'll kill him!

520
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
Enough!

521
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,300
How could you?

522
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,600
Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

523
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,800
That guy's word is law? The government?

524
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,600
I tried to stop you.

525
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,900
Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I hit him for not obeying.

527
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,400
That's no excuse.

528
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,600
You spoil him.

529
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
How so?

530
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,500
Don't you understand?

532
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,900
If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,300
I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,600
Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,000
Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,100
You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,900
What do you know?

538
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,700
Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,400
Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,500
I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,500
Have I ever complained?

542
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,500
Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,200
Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

544
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Daddy will make it better.

545
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,700
Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,400
come see the show.

547
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,800
He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:00,300
and blinds all who look within

550
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,200
I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:51,300
Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,300
Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

553
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,400
He wouldn't come.

554
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,000
Ask him again.

555
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,800
Say I want him to.

556
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,900
Youqing, daddy wants you to see the show.

557
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,200
Well?

558
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,000
I'm not going!

559
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,400
Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,800
Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,200
Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,400
Take him tea full of vinegar.

563
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,600
That will teach him.

564
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,200
Enough?

565
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,200
Okay, we'll really get him.

566
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,600
Should we add chili?

567
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,700
Good, it'll be hot and sour soup.

568
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,700
Your boy's on his way with a bowl of tea.

569
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,500
Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,500
Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,100
Daddy.

572
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,900
How do you like my singing?

573
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,500
You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

574
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,700
He's put in chili!
