00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,440
[Man] Welcome to the
oven, aka Camp Carolina:

2
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,320
our home away from home
in this godforsaken country.

3
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,960
What I can't convey,
via this video journal

4
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,440
is the incredible heat
and the local smells.

5
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,640
Oh, my God, it stinks.
[chuckles]

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,520
Yo, Mustangs!
Yo!

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,560
On 3, give me a smile!

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
1, 2, 3!

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,480
[shutter clicks]

10
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,840
But let me introduce myself.
My name is Angel Salazar.

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,120
Private Salazar.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm that poor Latino filmmaker

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,840
that did not get into USC.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,360
Hey! Papi Chulo, what's
goin' on over here, man?

15
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>Ai! Qué chulo!
Enter McCoy.</i>

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,080
<i>Hace calor!</i>

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm tryin' to make a video.
Oh, yeah? Tryin' to make--

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,200
You know what just happened
to your video? Yeah?

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
Just got a whole hell of a
lot sexier, baby. [laughs]

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, it did. Sexy is here.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,520
Making a video of me
making a video of you.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
Yeah, yeah. You're making a
video of me making a video of you.

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Uh-huh. Why is that?
Getting it all down

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,440
because this might be the last
video that either of us makes.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,920
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,480
Well, I'll tell you what.
Let's make a deal, then.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,840
You and me. Seriously.
All right.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,000
If I die in this war, I want you
to get all my videos, all right?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Okay. And if you die in this war,

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,520
I'll get your videos,
your camera,

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
and your girlfriend's
phone number.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,880
My girlfriend's number?

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
Yeah, your girlfriend's
phone number.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
What's Mrs. McCoy going
to be saying about that?

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
This is my brother.
Come on, man.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
All right, that's a deal.
Who do you think I am?

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,320
That's a deal. You know
what I like about you, Sally?

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,760
Yeah?
Besides absolutely nothing?

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,120
Absolutely nothing. And your
sweet and sunny disposition.

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,320
No, no, no. It's not about
sunny disposition, McCoy.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
It's about
telling it how it is.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
Oh, is that what it's about?

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
It's about telling it
how it is.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
You want to hear telling it--
Hey, hey! Hey!

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Over here, over here.
Please.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Focus on what's beautiful.
Thank you.

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,920
Do you want to hear me
telling it how it is?

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,880
Y'all want to hear
telling it how it is?

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,880
What do you all think's
gonna be the first casualty

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,400
of this entire conflict, huh?
[Man] You.

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,480
That's right!

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
It's not going to be
Rush or Flake

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,040
or "Don't ask, don't tell"
over here.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,400
You know what it's gonna be?
[Men] What?

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,880
Do you know what it's
going to be? Talk to me!

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
You know what it's gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,520
It's gonna be the truth.
[groaning]

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,360
Come on, now. Just
tellin' it like it is.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
You suck! What are you talking about?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Ah, here endeth the lesson.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,000
[laughs] That was some sad,
depressing stuff right there.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
All right, let me finish.
Let me finish.

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,440
All right. So I joined up
to get the money for college,

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
and a better chance
at film school. Yeah.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,240
I mean, I'm going to be a combat
vet, for chrissakes, right?

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,520
And with this awesome war film
in hand, they got to take me.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
Oh, yeah.
So while I'm over here,

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm gonna be shootin'
whatev-- [squeaks]

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
...whatever the fuck goes on.
[laughing]

70
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,040
Which so far-- Get--

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,600
Which so far
is basically nothing.

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,560
Now, our squad mans
a checkpoint outside Samarra.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,160
It's all day long
in the boiling hot sun,

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
wearing 120 pounds of gear,

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
checking out cars for
weapons and bombs and shit?

76
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,480
This deployment is
unspeakably underwhelming.

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,120
The only insurgent
we found so far

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,520
is one big fuckin' rat we
chased out of here last night.

79
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, that rat died.
So, get-- Get off.

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,080
'Cause I fucked it
to death.

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,840
So don't be expecting
any Hollywood action flick.

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,360
It's not going
to be smash cuts,

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,240
no adrenaline-pumping
soundtrack,

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,680
no logical narrative to
help you make sense of it.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Basically, here,
shit happens.

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,560
[Woman speaking French]

87
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,000
[Boy]
You want soda?

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
No. No.

89
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,880
I scored some
for one M.R.E.

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,520
Just go.

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Go on. Get out
of here. Go on.

92
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,360
Jesus.
He doesn't let up.

93
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,080
[candy clicking]

94
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,880
[Woman narrating]

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
[American soldier] As you
see, we set up road signs.

96
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
They're vividly colored,
highly visible,

97
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
and impossible to miss.

98
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,240
They're written
in English and Arabic,

99
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,920
and they inform
every single driver

100
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,680
that they're entering
a checkpoint.

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,960
[Woman, in French]

102
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,400
[speaks Arabic]
Get out of the car.

103
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,320
[Arabic continues]
Come up over here.

104
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
Quickly.
Let's go, people.

105
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,040
[Arabic]
Go, quick!

106
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
Get in line here.

107
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
Right there.
That's it, that's it.

108
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
Let's go, people.
Yell out.

109
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,120
[Arabic continues]

110
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,640
Arms up.

111
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,760
Arms down. Tell him
to open the trunk.

112
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
Open the trunk.
[Arabic]

113
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,560
Let's go, people.
Come on.

114
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
Come on, move.
[Arabic]

115
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,040
Don't go in. It's open, it's
open. Take your hands out of there.

116
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,240
[Arabic]

117
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,560
Is he afraid of the dog?
Afraid of the dog?

118
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,360
Who gives a fuck?
Fuck him.

119
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,600
Come over here.
Come over here.

120
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,080
Come on, stay in line.
Eyes front.

121
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,280
Sally?
All right, Blix.

122
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,120
The car is yours.
Good. Come here.

123
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,560
Come back, come back here.
In there. In there.

124
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,200
In there. Okay.
Up here, up here.

125
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,600
In. In. In, in, in.
In. In, in, in, boy.

126
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Come on. I need you
in there. In there.

127
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,680
Come on, boy. Wait.
Up here. Up here.

128
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,800
In there. In there. Up
here. Up here. Come on.

129
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,520
Good boy, Kevin.

130
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,400
Good boy, Kevin.
Good boy.

131
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
All right, come here.
Back through here.

132
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,960
[Angel] It's all clear. All right.

133
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,200
Tell them they can go in
the car and drive off slowly.

134
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,000
[Arabic]

135
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,880
[Woman speaking French]

136
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,920
[Angel] That's Gabe
Blix. He's from Virginia.

137
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,840
He doesn't talk a lot 'cause he's
got his nose in a book all the time.

138
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,720
Yo, Gabe, what you
readin' over there?

139
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm reading a book,
Salazar.

140
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,240
All right.
What's it about?

141
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,160
It's about-- Dude, no,
seriously. What are you doing?

142
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,520
What are you doing right
now? Who are you? I'm--

143
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
I want to get your opinion.
Okay, if you have that camera,

144
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,080
then you're part of the media,
and we're under strict orders

145
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,440
not to speak with you, yeah?
Don't call me media, asshole!

146
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Come on, just tell me what
you're reading. Tell me about it.

147
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,960
Dude, no. You're gonna make some, kinda
like commie rendition of our mission--

148
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,920
Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
This is about the truth, bro.

149
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,480
This is about what's going
down. This is the truth 24/7.

150
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,760
This camera, it never
lies. Yeah, the--

151
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,680
Dude, that is bullshit.
Okay?

152
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
'Cause that's all
that camera ever does.

153
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Just show me
the title of the book.

154
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,960
"Appoin--" Really?
All right. So, you know,

155
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,160
what's it got to say
about Samarra? Nothing.

156
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,680
Nothing.
No, nothing.

157
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,040
It's about this, like, guy,
he's this country club guy,

158
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,280
and he gets really drunk
on Christmas Eve,

159
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,160
and he throws his drink
in his boss' face.

160
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,120
And everybody in the whole
city that he lives in,

161
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
like right outside
of Philadelphia--

162
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,160
Okay, but what's it
got to do with Samarra?

163
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,280
It-- Nothing. The opening
makes reference to Samarra,

164
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,360
but besides that, you know, it's
just like, classic cover situation

165
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
What? Don't judge a book by its cover.

166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,880
Right.
Basically.

167
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,240
All right. So, uh--
Whoa, when's the appointment?

168
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,080
You don't want to know.
I do want to know!

169
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
Dude, you don't-- This is about books!
I don't have anything about books.

170
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
This is literary.
This is good.

171
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,440
The appointment, uh-- Do you want
me to just read you the introduction?

172
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,280
Perfect. Perfect.
Give me something good.

173
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,640
Okay, let me find it.

174
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,280
The introduction's
actually not by John O'Hara.

175
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,240
It's by W. Somerset Maugham.
Perfect.

176
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
And-- You have no idea
who that is, do you?

177
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,320
Not at all.
Didn't think so. Okay.

178
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,800
<i>It's called Death Speaks.
Oh, wait, it's spooky?</i>

179
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,680
All right. Read that
right into the camera. Go.

180
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,640
All right."There was
a merchant in Baghdad,

181
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,920
who sent his servant
to market to buy--"

182
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,080
All right, Gabe, wait.
Before you start reading that,

183
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,880
once you get into it, think
about what you're gonna say,

184
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,000
and then put some like,
you know, some heart behind it.

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Go!

186
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,280
"There was a merchant in Baghdad
who sent his servant to market

187
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,760
"to buy provisions,
and in a little while,

188
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,720
"the servant came back,
white and trembling,

189
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,040
"and said, 'Master, just now,

00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,280
when I was
in the marketplace'--"

191
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, this is a little bit
boring, bro. This is like--

192
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,040
I need to-- Dude, I don't
even want to do this.

193
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,400
Hey!
Yeah.

194
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,680
I got reading, too.

195
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Okay. All right, kid.
I win. Get out of here.

196

200
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,680
I get you anything.
You want soda?

201
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,480
No. I don't want any
fuckin' soda. [chuckles]

202
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,120
Hey, hey. Sally, Sally!

203
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,440
Ain't you supposed to be saying
"action" on me, or something like that?

204
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,320
All right. Here we go.
I'm Master Sergeant James--

205
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,560
[Men]
Ohh!

206
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,600
It stands for M.R.E.:
"Meals Refusing to Excrete."

207
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,960
What you doin', Sally?
God damn, man! That's shit.

208
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,200
You're asking for this.
Hey, hey, Sally!

209
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,160
Come on, now.
All right, you ready?

210
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm Master Sergeant James
Sweet-- Over here.

211
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,560
Hey.
What's he lookin' at?

212
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,920
Boy! Get out of here. Hey.

213
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Full security. Full security.

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,920
Get over here, Blake.
Oh, oh!

217
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,880
Don't be givin' your
fuckin' food, man. No. No.

[sighs]

220
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,760
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

221
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,560
Stay away from anything
and everything

222
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,200
these little midget Ali Babas
give you, all right?

223
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,280
Yo, why not, Master Sergeant?
Why not?

224
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,600
See, my black ass has been over here
for three goddamn tours, all right?

225
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,760
I don't trust
anybody over here. Shit.

226
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,200
How long have you been
over here, Flake?

227
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Just a couple months.
Just a couple of months.

228
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,720
Shit. Got ourselves
a goddamn virgin here.

229
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
Oh!
No, I'm not a virgin

230
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah, all right.
[Angel] I bet.

231
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,200
And what'd you do before that?
I just hung out, you know?

232
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
Fucking around.
Gettin' drunk.

233
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,360
Tried to stay out
of jail.

234
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
Sally, come on over here.
Look at this miserable fuck.

235
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,120
This one?
Yeah.

236
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,320
Got him. Probably suckin'
dick for beer money,

237
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,120
if it wasn't for the Army.
Oh.

238
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,400
Look, you're right. I was
suckin' dick for beer money.

239
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,120
This here is the cream of
the Army recruits, right here.

240
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
[Angel] Ouch.
[Sweet] "Cream" is no joke.

241
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,520
You're so goddamn white, boy, you
wouldn't wear yourself after Labor Day.

242
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,240
[chuckles]
All right, tell me, Flynny.

243
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,040
Tell me. Like, what was it? You either
had to serve time here or stateside?

244
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,520
Something like that.
Yeah.

245
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,600
Well, you want to get
your ass back in one piece?

246
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,440
I most definitely do.
Well, good.

247
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,320
Stop lookin' to get
yourself killed, then.

248
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,040
You chow down on anything these
little motherfuckin' ragheads give you,

249
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,320
it's like swallowin'
an IED

250
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,080
I wa-- It's a date.
Look at this.

251
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,440
Do you think I want
to eat this?

252
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,400
I wasn't going to eat this.
I was trying to be friendly.

253
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,080
They don't want
to be your friend, slick.

254
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,360
They want to piss on your back and
tell you that it's raining, all right?

255
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,320
Look, trust me. You eat that
shit, and next thing you know,

256
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,880
you gonna be
spittin' up blood.

257
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
Hey, look alive,
soldier. All right?

258
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,560
We get back to the house, get yourself
a little kitty kitty, how 'bout that?

259
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,600
[Angel] Woof-woof!
How can you arrange that?

260
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,280
Look alive, look alive! This right
here is my motherfuckin' Caucasian.

261
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,000
<i>He's mine too!
You're my motherfuckin' ese.</i>

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,280
<i>I am your ese?
That's right. Come on.</i>

263
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
Yo, Master Sergeant.
What?

264
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,200
We swept by this place
yesterday, right?

265
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,160
Hell, yeah. Bet your ass we're
gonna do it again tomorrow.

266
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,200
Because when
the sun goes down,

267
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,720
<i>these motherfuckin' hajjis
come out their ratholes</i>

268
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,560
and resow their IED's in different
and more surprising places

269
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,080
than the day before,
and you can bet your ass

270
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,680
that these smilin',
soccer-playin' shitbirds

271
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,560

Slow down! Slow down.
Slow it down. Hey! Stop!

274
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,600
Stop the fucking car!
Stop! Stop the goddamn car!

275
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,280
Sally, we got one! Stop!
Stop the god--

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,000
Sal!

277
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,760

Let's go. Come on.

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,520
[Sally] Say hello to
B.B. Rush and Reno Flake.

289
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,360
Flake is your average grunt, completely
in touch with his primal self,

290
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,840
He's one of our
latest recruits

291
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,800
from way down on the bottom
of the gumbo barrel.

292
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,280
Boy, he discovered
his soul mate: B.B. Rush.

293
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,960
The guy's dumber than
shit, but he's loyal.

294
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,040
Now, they only want
two things here:

295
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,080
to fuck or to fight.

296
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,240
And yesterday, Flake blew
away his first civilian.

297
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,000
Yo, Flake,
what you readin'?

298
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,720
Oh, yeah?
You been gettin' any?

299
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,520
Mm.
No.

300
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,240
All right.
I have.

301
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,600
All right, fine.
Yo, Flake.

<i>How do you feel about
that hajji you smoked?</i>

303
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,200
Well--
[mumbling]

304
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,280
All I know is, the only language
these sand niggers understand is force.

305
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,760
And I'm just the cat
to make the introductions.

306
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,040
Fuckin' Roger that, man.

307
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,880
Oh, but the truth be told?
Truth be told, Flake.

308
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,720
Truth be told. Truth is, it wasn't
everything it's cracked up to be.

309
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
I mean, I thought my first
kill shot would blow my mind,

310
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,560
[imitates shot]
but--

311
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,080
It was nothing.
It was like guttin' catfish.

312
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
Yo. Sarge, you waved
that guy to stop, right,

313
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,040
<i>that hajji retard?</i>

314
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,960
Oh, yeah. This guy, uh--

315
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,280
Yeah, but the problem is that
most of these fuckin' people,

316
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,360
you know, when you put
your hand up?

317
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,000
They don't know that
that means to stop.

318
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,920
You know, most of these Iraqis
think that you're wavin' hello.

319
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,760
[Rush] But they fuckin' know what
it means now. All I know is...

320
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
these cats screamed
their heads off,

321
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
screamed his little,
lady lungs out,

322
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,200
you screamed your beaucoup
brains off-- Ha ha.

323
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,520
And that car just kept comin',
right across that trigger line.

324
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,960
What the fuck else am I
supposed to do but light 'em up?

325
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,240
Light 'em the fuck up.
You did your job.

326
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,320
All right.
But, you know, Flake,

327
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,120
you're not gonna win
many hearts and minds

328
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
pumping pregnant women
full of lead, though, right?

329
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
That's true, Sally.
Come on. Salazar.

330
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,080
I mean, what do you want me to do?
Get all teary-eyed and say I'm sorry?

331
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,560
[Salazar chuckles]

332
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,200
[chuckles]
"I'm so sorry."

333
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,640
[Rush laughing]

334
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,120
My life's been
changed forever?

335
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,200
My life's been changed
forever, fuck.

336

<i>Waxing hajjis is like
stomping cockroaches.</i>

337
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,920
I've been there. I've done
that, and it makes me thirsty.

338
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
So how about
a nice, cold beer?

339
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,400
[grunts]

340
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,320
[Rush]
God damn!

341
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,160
[Sally] So Flake--
It's the next fuckin' shipment.

342
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,960
Flake, there's no remorse, now
that you know that she's pregnant?

343
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,600
Now that you know that she had
a child in her womb over there?

344
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,680
Nothin'?

345
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,240
You really have
no remorse.

346
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,960
I don't know what the fuck
I'm supposed to--

347
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,680
How am I supposed to--
You have no second thoughts.

348
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
I have second thoughts.
Let me tell you something:

349
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,920
you have a kid, you have
a wife that's pregnant--

350
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,600
Hold up. Hold up. No, no, no, hold
up. You'll have second thoughts.

351
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,320
You can't afford remorse, okay?

352
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,960
You get remorse, you get weak. I'm
not saying you didn't do a good job.

353
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
You get weak, you die.

354
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
As simple as that.
He did his fuckin' job.

355
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
What are you saying?
You have a kid,

356
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,200
you have a pregnant wife, you
become more of a human being.

357
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,280
If you have a kid, you're gonna be
even more on your fuckin' plan then.

358
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,760
Because you can't afford-- I'm
not saying you're not on your plan.

359
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,560
...not to go home
without diapers.

360
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,400
What the hell
is wrong with you?

361
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
How do we know that
her-- the fuckin'... Hey!

362
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,440
How do we know if the bun
in her fuckin' oven... Hey!

363
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,920
At ease the shit, all right? Look,
point in fact, he did his job.

364
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,600
Rules of engagement states

365
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,120
if they cross the trigger line,
he kills 'em.

366
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
That's fuckin' right!

367
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,040
Hey! Get the fuck
away from him!

368
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,920
Sarge, how the fuck am I
supposed to see in there? How?

369
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,320
Have a fucking heart.

370
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,560
Get in your fucking rack!
Enough.

371
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,480
Everybody go to bed,
all right?

372
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,200
Does anybody have
a fucking problem with that?

373
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
Enough.
Shut the fucking camera off!

374
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,240
[Cameraman]
All right, all right.

375
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,160
Ten-hut!

376
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,560
Okay, guys. You've all
done a tremendous job,

377
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,120
and I wanna personally thank
each and every one of you.

378
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,960
Colonel Ford, permission
to speak, sir?

379
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,560
Go ahead.
Thank you.

380
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
We just wanted to thank you
for your kind words, and, also,

381
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,480
there have been some rumors circulating
about a possible follow-up mission.

382
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,920
No, no, no. I haven't heard
anything about that.

383
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,840
But it does look like we have to keep
up the work here just a little longer.

384
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,800
Longer, sir?
How much longer?

385
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,520
As long as it takes, Private!
That's what you're here for!

386
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,360
Now buck the fuck up!
Yes, sir!

387
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,680
I just got orders.

388
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Second Battalion of 727
is pinned down in Baghdad.

389
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,280
They can't replace us
till someone replaces them.

390
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,200
So half a company will have to
temporarily remain here in Samarra

391
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,760
to man the checkpoints and
keep a lid on insurgent traffic.

392
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,320
<i>You know what it's like? I swear
to God, it's like that Clerks movie.</i>

393
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,760
You know, where the guy
has to work on his day off,

394
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,440
and all kinds
of crazy shit happens,

395
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,880
and all he keeps thinking is,

396
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
Oh, man, I'm not even
supposed to be here today.

397
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,080
None of us are supposed
to be here. Fuck, man!

398
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
We're just asking
to get waxed.

399
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
Dude, all I'm saying is,
they just keep saying,

400
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,640
"All right.
You're going home tomorrow."

401
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,600
And the next day,
it's the same shit.

402
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,800
You're going home tomorrow.

403
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,440
Fuckin' on and on,
week after week.

404
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,600
"You're going home tomorrow."
And we're still here, man.

405
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,680
We're like sitting ducks.

406
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,080
Take care of this,
Sergeant.

407
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,040
Fuckin' Sally, get
that camera out of my face!

408
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,880
What the fuck is your problem?
What are you bitching about?

409
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
What, because they
extended our deployment?

410
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,720
Big fuckin' surprise!

411
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,840
Welcome to the goddamn Army!

412
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
We all want to fuckin'
go home! We can't.

413
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,240
So stand the fuck up
and be a fucking man about it!

414
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Drive on with
a fuckin' hard-on! Yeah?

415
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,240
[mumbles in affirmation]
Let's go!

416
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,440
Coming here is one step closer
to that appointment.

417
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520
What'd you say, Gabe?
I said, every fucking day here

418
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,480
is one step closer
to that appointment.

419
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,160
What?

420
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,600
That book, the one that I read to
you, the one that was so boring,

421
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,440
you should check it out.

422
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
"Death speaks.

423
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,240
"There was a merchant
in Baghdad

424
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,880
"who sent his servant
to market to buy provisions.

425
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,000
"And in a little while,
the servant came back

426
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,680
"white and trembling,
and said,

427
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,880
"'Master, just now,
when I was in the marketplace,

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,600
"'I was jostled
by women in the crowd,

429
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,840
"'and when I turned, I saw
it was Death that jostled me.

430
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,400
"'She looked at me
and made a threatening gesture.

431
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,960
"'Now, lend me your horse,

432
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,800
"'and I will ride away from
the city and avoid my fate.

433
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,880
"I will go to Samarra.
There, Death will not find me.'

"The merchant lent him his
horse, and the servant mounted it,

435
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,000
"and he dug his spurs
in his flanks,

436
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,200
"and as fast as the horse
could gallop, he went.

437
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,640
"Then the merchant
went down to the marketplace,

438

"and he saw me
standing in the crowd,

439

"and he came to me and said,

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
"'Why did you make a
threatening gesture to my servant

441
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,600
"when you saw him
this morning?'

442
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,400
"'That was not
a threatening gesture,' I said.

443
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,600
"'It was only
a startled surprise.

444
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,080
"'I was astonished
to see him in Baghdad,

445

00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,600
That house we raided last week.

661
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,320
I didn't see any orders
about that.

662
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,480
Dude, we're going to Farah's.

663
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,800
Farah's house. That's right. [grunting]

664
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,200
What are you guys talking about?
That's not... We just...

665
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,240
There's nothing
in that house.

666
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,240
How can you say that
that tasty skank is nothing?

667
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,760
Come on, dude. We're gonna take
some initiative and go to that house.

668
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,360
She's a spoil of war.
That's right.

669
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,040
Oh, I forgot.
That's exactly right.

670
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,600
Okay, you guys
are fucking crazy.

671
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,240
Come on. They're drunk.
Dude, we're all drunk.

672
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,600
Turn that fucking thing
off.

673
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
No, keep that
fucking thing on.

674
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,000
Fuck off! This is off the record,
so turn the fucking camera off!

675
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
Back off. All right,
all right. Keep it on!

676
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,680
Fuck off!
Guys, relax.

677
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Let's just play the game. You guys are
really drunk, as I was saying before.

678
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
So I actually think maybe... I'm
seeing things clearer than you.

679
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,640
No, you're not seeing
anything clearer, Flake.

680
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,680
Flake, you haven't seen anything
clear in, like, four months.

681
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,200
Stop it!
Who doesn't see clear?

682
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
How the fuck am I
supposed to see clearly?

683
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,840
[chuckles]

684
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,840
I mean,
what are we doing here?

685
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,200
"What are we doing here?" Yeah,
what the fuck are we doing here?

686
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,640
You know
what we're doing here.

687
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,120
We're helping the new
Iraqi government survive.

688
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,600
Knuckleheads.

689
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,960
And what the fuck
do you think

690
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
is so important about that?

691
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
I think there's a lot
important about that.

692
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Enlighten me.
We're, you know-- We're--

693
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,960
What?
We're just doing our job.

694
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,120
We're not-- We're not
supposed to think about it.

695
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,840
We're supposed to follow
orders. We're soldiers. Amen.

696
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,200
Yeah.
Welcome to the fucking Army.

697
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,120
But these people
don't want us here.

698
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,640
Yes, they do. No, they don't.
They want us dead and gone.

699
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,680
And when those fucking beltway clerks
finally find that out, we're gonna be both.

700
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,680
So, in the meantime,
Rush and me

701
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,160
and...Gabriel... I have
to say shut the fuck up.

702
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,880
Get away from me,
because I'm not doing...

703
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,200
You're such a pussy! I'm not a pussy because
I don't wanna break through the door...

704
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,880
Oh, no, the door's
already broken down.

705
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,160
The door's already broken down.
The father's locked up.

706
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,320
What's the problem? Nothing
to worry about. Let's do it.

707
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,000
Sounds like the perfect
cap on the evening. I agree.

708
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,440
Yeah, perfect cap on the evening.
I'm gonna go wake up Sarge.

709
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,600
I'm gonna ask him what the SOP is on
a gang rape. You're not gonna say shit!

710
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,480
Don't wake up Sarge for this.
I'm not gonna say shit?

711
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,720
No, you're not gonna say shit. You
know why Sarge is finding out shit?

712
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,560
Why?
Because nothing's gonna happen,

713
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,720
because you guys couldn't even get
outside the wire if you wanted to.

714
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,160
Get your fucking hands off me!
Hey! Hey! Cut it out. Cut it out.

715
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,920
That's bullshit!
Sit down, sit down.

716
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,560
If you can find your chair.
Got it.

717
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,360
All right. Can we
play the fucking game?

718
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,520
Jesus Christ, Gabe!
What do you think, Sally?

719
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,440
I-- I think I'm gonna be going for
this little-- this little jaunt.

720
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
Yeah, you are, baby!

721
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,720
[laughing]

722
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,520
Sally's got a set of balls.

723
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,160
What about you, McCoy?
Are you serious?

724
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,840
Come on, dude. Come with.
Get your fucking hand off me.

725
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,000
No, fuck him.
Pussy boy doesn't want to go.

726
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,760
Dude, let me
tell you something.

727
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,520
First of all, y'all
are drunk. Thank you.

728
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,440
Probably high doing all
sorts of fucking drugs

729
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,360
or whatever the hell
you're doing.

730
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,040
You're fucked-up.
But?

731
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,720
If I go, it's to make sure you don't get
your asses killed. That's right. When we go.

732
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
We are not
gonna get killed!

733
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,240
<i>"Hello, honey.</i>

734
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,680
<i>"I don't have much time,
but I have to send you this.</i>

735
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,320
<i>"First, I want you to know
that I love you very much.</i>

736
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,280

737
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,760

739
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,400
<i>"you just sent me
of you and the boys.</i>

740
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,720
<i>"I'm wishing to God
I was there instead of here.</i>

741
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,120
<i>"The guys have been
drinking all day,</i>

742
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,560
<i>"and it looks like they're
going out looking for trouble.</i>

743
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,760
<i>"I can't stop them,</i>

744
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,240
<i>"but I'm going to make sure</i>

745
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,160
<i>"they don't

747
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,560
<i>"It's too dangerous.</i>

748
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,600
<i>"Anyway, I love you.</i>

749
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,800

750
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,920
<i>[sighs]</i>

751
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
<i>I knew he was doing
raids outside the wire,</i>

752
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,360
<i>but he hadn't done
too many in a while,</i>

753
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,400
<i>and I-I'd built up
a sense of security</i>

754
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,280
<i>in knowing this.</i>

755
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,280
<i>I live for his phone calls
and his chats online, you know?</i>

756
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,280
<i>They help me not
to worry so much.</i>

757
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,800
<i>But today is--</i>

758
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,800

00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,200
<i>Um, I'm scared. I'm--</i>

761
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,840
<i>I'm scared to death for him.</i>

762
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,720
I rigged a mini-cam
to my helmet

763
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,160
so I can record
tonight's follies

764
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,920
without the guys
knowing about it.

765
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,600
I don't want 'em
getting camera-shy.

767
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,600

gonna do?</i>

I'm gonna--</i>

<i>...go with them and try to
talk some sense into them.</i>

770
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
<i>Dude, they're going to get
about 20 feet outside there,</i>

771

<i>they'll get scared
of the dark,</i>

772
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,720
<i>and come right back here.
And what about Sally?</i>

773
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,560
<i>Sa-- Man, you know,
Sally-- What's he doing?</i>

774
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,200
<i>He's gonna go out there, come
running back to base camp,</i>

775
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,200
<i>turn on his camcorder and give a
firsthand account of what he saw.</i>

776
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,120
<i>It's sick.
It's fuckin' sick.</i>

821
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,320
I'm talking about fucking
with a 15-year-old girl.

822
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,440
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're all discombobulated.

823
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,760
<i>You got to lay off
that hajji juice,</i>

824
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,240
'cause that is
some sneaky shit.

825
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,600
I don't touch that fucking
shit, you know that.

826
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,160
Really? What the fuck
are you doing up here?

827
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,760
You're supposed to be
at the rear. Excuse me?

828
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,160
You giving me
an order, Private Flake?

829
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,080
That's right, Corporal.
Get to the fuckin' rear!

830
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,720
Fuck off me!
[laughing]

831
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,680
Fuck you!
Fuck off, bitch.

832
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,560
[Sally] McCoy! McCoy,
you're not going to go in?

833
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,320
Fuck it!
McCoy, come on!

834
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
What's your excuse, Sally? Huh?
Excuse for what?

835
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,080
Excuse for wanting
to take a part of this, huh?

836
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,800
McCoy, I'm a fly on the wall. I got
to get a record of what's happening.

837
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,280
That's right, you're the
fly on the fuckin' wall. Yes!

838
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,080
Actually, Sally, I think
you're a fuckin' jackal!

839
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,000
Ripping meat off
a fucking carcass!

840
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,080
That's what you are.
Can I quote you on that one?

841
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,720
Sure, Sally, quote away.

842
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,240
You know what? I got another quote
for you. You ready? What? What?

843
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,920
Take a look around you at all your
greedy, media buddies-- You dick.

844
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,000
...who sold their soul for
a talk show and a book deal!

845
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,640
'Cause that's what you are! This is my
free pass into film school, right now.

846
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,360
Really? Well done, Sally.
[Women screaming]

847
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,440
Take it all down,
cry for cry,

848
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,680
and scream for scream--
go ahead!

849
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,400
Thanks for your permission,
there, dick.

850
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,720
Oh, look out there, Mac.

851
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,760
I don't want you tripping
over your goddamn soapbox.

852
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,680
Fuck it.

853
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,840
Fuck you!

854
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,480
[shouting, screaming]

855
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,040
Flake! Flake.

856
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,600
Flake,
enough's enough, man.

857
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,240
Enough's enough.
You've had your fun.

858
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,640
Let's get out of here.
We're just gettin' started.

859
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,680
We just got here. What
the fuck's your problem, McCoy?

860
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,680
You shouldn't be here,
Flake, and you know it.

861
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,040
We're just here, man.
We're here,

862
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,080
and we are gonna fuckin'
find these-- [crying]

863
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,200
weapons-- we're searching
for evidence--

864
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,480
We're looking for weapons
of mass destruction!

865
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
Weapons of mass destruction.
That's right.

866
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,720
I don't give a shit
what anybody says.

867
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,160
They're here, and
we're going to find them.

868
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,200
Flake, there is nothing
here, and you know it!

869
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,280
What are you fucking-- We ripped
this place apart last week.

870
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,600
There's nothing here!
They're just like weeds, McCoy.

871
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,520
You rip 'em up, they're all
back the next day, aren't they?

872
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,360
She's a 15-year-old girl, man.
She's a 15-year-old girl.

873
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,400
We're going to accomplish this
mission. Please don't do this.

874
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,160
We are going to conquer that.
It's inhuman to rape.

875
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,760
She's a fine cunt, just like
everybody else in this fucking country.

876
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,080
I'm not doin' it, man.
You fuckin' candy ass!

877
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,120
Well, you're not doin' it!
Shut the fuck up.

878
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,120
Are you not
supporting the troops?

879
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,960
What? Are you not supporting the troops?

880
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,120
No.
[laughing]

881
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,800
Oops. Did I just blow
your fuckin' head off?

882
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,720
Don't.
Where are your balls, McCoy?

883
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,880
Man, I thought you had a
pair. What are they, at home?

884
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,400
<i>Inside your wife's
sandy hajj pussy?</i>

885
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,760
[McCoy] God! [laughing]

886
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,640
Fuck you!

887
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,280
[Flake]
Thought you had a pair.

888
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,320
How about you, Rush?
Where are your balls?

889
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,960
They're almost
in her ass, sir.

890
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,760
Almost in her ass.
What about you, Sally?

891
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,400
Get it up!
"I can't hear you, sir."

892
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,360
They're right here. I can't
hear you. I can't hear you!

893
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,600
They're right here!
Where are your balls?

894
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,320
They're right here!
Good!

895
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,880
All right.
[whispering in Arabic]

896
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,880
All right, motherfucker.
Hitch a ride outside.

897
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,400
Take the faggot watch. [Rush] Yeah,
take the faggot watch, you pussy!

898
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,920
Bunch of fuckin' assholes.
Fuck you.

899
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,480
What do you think
of that, huh?

900
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,840
Ooh, did you like that?

901
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,240
Did you miss me, huh?

902
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,360
[Rush laughing, groaning]

903
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,120
Oh, it's go time for you.
You ready?

904
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,560
Huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

905
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,440
So, you ready?
Here you go, here you go.

906
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,640
Come here, Salazar. Come
here. Take her fucking hand.

907
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,120
Take her fucking hand!
Rush. Rush.

908
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,640
[pleading in Arabic]
Rush, hold on!

909
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,440
Wait. Wait for Flake. Hold
on, Rush. Wait for Flake.

910
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,600
This is his idea. He gets
the cherry. Come on, wait up.

911
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,680
What? You got a problem
with sloppy seconds?

912
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,920
[screaming]
[automatic weapons burst]

913
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,400
Holy shit!
[laughs]

914
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,240
He tried to use
this on me.

915
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,960
Motherfuck.
[laughs]

916
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,000
Those motherfuckers! What
the fuck do you think I did?

917
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,160
I fuckin' killed them all.
I killed them all.

918
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,240
[Rush laughs hysterically]
Every fuckin' one of them.

919
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,120
They're fuckin'
all gone, baby.

920
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,960
They're all fuckin' gone.
[laughing]

921
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,680
All right.
Sally, come on over here, baby.

922
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,080
It's showtime. Take the
fuckin' hand. Here we go.

923
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,280
[Arabic]
[laughing]

924
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,160
Oh. You ready? You ready for
the ride of your life, bitch?

925
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,520
[screaming]

926
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,840
Shut the fuck up! Don't
you fuckin' make a sound!

927
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,920
Give it to her!
[Rush hooting, laughing]

928
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,280
Aah!
[Flake grunts]

929
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,000
God!
What happened?

930
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,440
What happened in there?
Talk to me!

931
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,560
<i>Tell them-- No! Fuck!
What are you talking about?</i>

932
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,720
<i>McCoy!</i>

933
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,400
<i>What's up, Rush?</i>

934
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,440
<i>What are you doing?
What am I doing?</i>

935
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,560
<i>What are you telling Blix? Nothing.</i>

936
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,320
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, man.</i>

937
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,400
<i>Just shooting
the breeze, huh?</i>

938
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,960
<i>Get the fuck off him, Rush.
Back off!</i>

939
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,440
<i>Back off, Blix!
I'll cut you like a pig!</i>

940
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,200
<i>Sit down.
Okay, okay.</i>

941
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,720
<i>Get the fuck off me! If you
fuckin' move, I'll snap it.</i>

942
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,760
<i>It'll be real quick.
Piece of shit.</i>

943
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,080
<i>I want you to listen
to me real careful, Mac.</i>

944
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,600
<i>Listen to what?</i>

945
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,480
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

946
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,400
<i>What?
Are you fucking deaf, McCoy?</i>

947
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,080
<i>Am I speaking too softly
for you? No, I hear you.</i>

948
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,200
<i>All right. So you're tuned
in on my frequency, right?</i>

949
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,720
<i>Yes. Good. Now let me ask you again.</i>

950
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,120
<i>Have you ever
been to Vegas?</i>

951
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,240
<i>Yes, I've been
to fucking Vegas.</i>

952
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,680
<i>Good. Now what
do they say?</i>

953
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,320
<i>Uh-- What do they say
about what happens there?</i>

954
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,240
<i>It stays there.
I'm sorry. What was that?</i>

955
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,920
<i>It stays there.</i>

956
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,640
<i>"What happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."</i>

957
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,040
<i>That's right.
That's right, Big Mac.</i>

958
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,600
<i>Now I want you to think
about our little trip tonight,</i>

959
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,000
<i>like it was a trip to Vegas. Okay.</i>

960
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,320
<i>You read me, soldier?
Yes, I read you.</i>

961
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,720
<i>Do you fuckin' read me?
Yes, I hear you!</i>

962
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,800
<i>[sniffs deeply]</i>

963
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,840
<i>[coughs]</i>

964
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,480
<i>Sometimes, man--</i>

965
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,440
<i>I swear to God.</i>

966
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,000
<i>For a college boy, you can
be real fucking stupid.</i>

967
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,280
<i>Where's Flake, Rush?</i>

968
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,280
<i>What the fuck
do you care, hairball?</i>

969
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,960
<i>Huh?</i>

970
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,040
<i>For your information, our boy
Flake is inside right now.</i>

971
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,920
<i>Sleeping like
a little baby.</i>

972
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,040
<i>You know what
that's like, right, Blix?</i>

973
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,280
<i>Right after you've been
sucked and fucked?</i>

974
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,800
<i>Hey, Mac, man.
Where were you?</i>

975
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,160
<i>What do you mean,
where was I?</i>

976
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,960
<i>I mean, what the fuck
happened to you?</i>

977
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,920
<i>I went outside.
I was on watch.</i>

978
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,040
<i>[scoffs] Flake stuck a gun
in my face. You remember that?</i>

979
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,120
<i>That's right, that's right.
You were on watch.</i>

980
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,800
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

981
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,400
<i>Ah. No, I didn't
see anything.</i>

982
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,400
<i>Well, that's good. That's good,
because you were on watch, right?</i>

983
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,760
<i>Yeah, I was on watch, so--</i>

984
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,200
<i>I mean, it was kind of
dark out there, too.</i>

985
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,680
<i>Yeah, it was
pitch dark, actually.</i>

986
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,480
<i>Yeah.</i>

987
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,840
<i>What about the fire?
Did you see the fire?</i>

988
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,680
<i>Fire?
It was a big fuckin' fire.</i>

989
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,360
<i>You didn't see that?
No, I didn't see it.</i>

990
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,160
<i>I had my back
to the house,</i>

991
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,560
<i>just looking around,
so I guess I must have</i>

992

<i>missed the fire.</i>

993
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,840
<i>That's good.
That's good, man.</i>

994
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,360
<i>And what about
the insurgents?</i>

995
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,040
<i>Insurgents?
Yeah, man.</i>

996
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,000
<i>We had to hightail it
out of there.</i>

997
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,640
<i>They were
like, all over the place.</i>

998
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,680
<i>And really pissed.</i>

999
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,640
<i>Mm.</i>

1000
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,480
<i>That must have been one of
those Sunni-Shiite things.</i>

1001
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,280
<i>Right.
You know, I mean--</i>

1002
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,520
<i>We don't want to get caught
in a civil war crossfire.</i>

1003
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:31,360
<i>So the, uh, insurgents
set the fire.</i>

1004
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,400
<i>Yeah, it must have been.</i>

1005
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,960

<i>when they're not trying
to kill us,</i>

1007

<i>[chuckles]</i>

00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,240
<i>Yeah, they're torchi''

1009

[Arabic]

1010
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,320
And when did you start
having these dreams?

1011
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,400
A couple nights.
I couldn't sleep.

1012
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,320
I don't want to sleep.

1013
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,240
Can you remember anything?
Anything that happened

1014
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,840
that could have
triggered them?

1015
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,120
Yeah, after Sweet died?

1016
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,800
And I was shooting it
when it happened.

1017
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,960
He got blown apart.
I got it all on tape.

1018
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,360
His arm landed
right in front of me.

1019
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,360
Have you looked
at the video?

1020
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,400
Couple of times,
but then I stop,

1021
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,840
but it kept going, going over
and over again in my head.

1022
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,320
That's when I began
hating everyone.

1023
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,080
<i>Every hajji out there.</i>

1024
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,520
I couldn't stand the sight of
them, and I got angry all the time.

1025
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,240
And then I couldn't sleep,
and every time I did,

1026
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,400
I'd have the same dream
of her body burning.

1027
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,160
Her body?

1028
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,600
No. No.
No, his body.

1029
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,440
Sweet's body.

1030
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,080
It gets mixed up
in my head.

1031
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,560
And you videoed it.

1032
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,480
Yeah. It's part of my diary
of my experiences here.

1033
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,360
I'm going to use it
to get into film school.

1034
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,360
Is this part
of your experience?

1035
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,200
What, talking to you?
Yeah.

1036
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,440
Talking to me.

1037
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,920
I can't do it anymore.

1038
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,560
Everything
you shouldn't see,

1039
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,000
just because you're watching it
doesn't mean you're not a part of it.

1040
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,120
That's what everyone does, you know?
They just watch, and they do nothing.

1041
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,680
[weeping] Or they make a
video for people to watch,

1042
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,080
and they do nothing!

1043
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,880
[sobbing]

1044
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,760
Got to tell someone.

1045
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,600
It's driving me crazy.

1046
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,200
Dad, if something happened,

1047
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,200
something really,
really horrible,

1048
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,560
and you knew who
was responsible,

1049
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,040
isn't it your duty
to say something?

1050
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,080
What did you do?

1051
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,080
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do a damn thing.

1052
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,560
A couple of my buddies--

1053
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,480
Members of your squad?
Yes, sir.

1054
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,240
I hope you realize how serious
this situation could be.

1055
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,920
Yes, I do realize.

1056
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,440
We don't need another
Abu Ghraib.

1057
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,960
I understand that,
sir, but--

1058
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,880
I mean, if your brothers
screwed up,

1059
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,560
that behavior reflects
on the whole Corps.

1060
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,120
There was a crime, sir. I
think charges should be brought.

1061
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,280
Son, listen to me.

1062
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,760
Do you know the first thing
to come into question

1063
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,280
in a court martial
in a thing like this

1064
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,360
will be your sanity.
My sanity?

1065
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,120
That's right! Your sanity,
for bringing charges like this.

1066
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,120
[sighs]

1067
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,640
I don't care.

1068
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,120
I don't care.

1069
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,120
Here I am, Mama, in
beautiful, downtown Samarra,

1070
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,120
getting you
a homecoming present.

1071
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,160
I've been shooting
some unbelievable stuff.

1072
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,040
I can't show it to anybody, because
I'd get in a lot of trouble here.

1073
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,000
But when I get back,
everyone's going to see this.

1074
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,080
The truth about
what's going down here.

1075
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,720
24 times a second,
24/7--

[Male reporter] The body being
loaded into this military ambulance

1082
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,600
is believed to be that of the U.S.
soldier missing since last Friday.

1083
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,240
That's according to Iraq Defense
Ministry Secretary, Abdul Aziz.

1084
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,600
This Bedouin encampment
where the body was discovered

1085
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,520
just moments ago is outside
the Samarra base camp

1086
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,240
where the soldier
was kidnapped.

1087
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,320
The Pentagon has not yet
issued a statement

1088
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,800
on the identity of the body,

1089
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,680
but senior sources tell us it
could be the body of Angel Salazar,

1090
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,320
who went missing last Friday.

1091
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,120
Iraqi Defense Ministry
spokesmen have said

1092
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,440
the details are
very disturbing.

1093
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,120
There are signs of
torture and decapitation.

your buddy?

1112
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,440

And how
was he generous?

He was a...
dedicated reporter.

1122
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,640
He used that camera.
This camera right here?

1123

To record his-- our--
war stories.

1124

1145
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,080

two favorite sons

favorite places.

1147
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,960
Hmm.
Called us his wild cards.

Yeah, I thought so.

01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,200
I do, too.
Vegas was a Teamster.

01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,600
Mm-hmm.
And the head of his local,

1152
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,000
Mike Dancer,
he's a troublemaker.

1153
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,760
He'd run for president
of the U.T.,

1154
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,520
and lost, now the bitter prick
Dancer's contesting the election.

1155
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,680
Got ahold of some
ballot boxes

1156
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,760
that my brother Vegas
had rigged,

1157
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,240
and he's blowing his whistle
to federal prosecutors.

1158
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,120
Nothing but a fucking rat.
Word comes down.

1159
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,360
He's got to go.

1160
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,200
So, what happened?

1161
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,400
A fucking embarrassment.

1162
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,920
A bunch of clowns who need a road
map to find their own assholes

1163
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,880
drive out to his house
one night.

1164
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,320
Knock on the door.

1165
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,640
And are they, like,
locked and loaded?

1166
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,240
Yeah! Yeah, they are
locked and loaded.

1167
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,320
[laughs] So? So.

1168
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,920
Dancer opens the door.

1169
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,520
He's there, big as life
in his shorts and T-shirt,

1170
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,200
holding his fucking
newspaper?

1171
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,200
And what do you think
our Wild Bunch did?

1172
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,920
They just blasted
the shit out of him, right?

1173
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,680
Wrong. They asked him
for a job.

1174
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,680
A job.
Yeah, that's right.

1175
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,560
A job. They're too
chickenshit to shoot him.

1176
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,560
He's the head of a local.

1177
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,440
Since they're not getting paid
for not killing him--

1178
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,200
and what the fuck are they
doing on his doorstep anyway--

1179
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,240
[chuckles]
they ask him for a job.

1180
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,920
They really asked him
for a job?

1181
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,800
Yeah, he says to 'em, too.
He's like,

1182
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,440
"Come by the office in the morning.
I'll see what I can do for you."

1183
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,840
They get in the car,
drive to the nearest bar.

1184
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,440
Fucking embarrassment.

1185
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,280
Right, I don't get it.

1186
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,880
Listen on, my man.

1187
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,160
Clyde, the mastermind
of this group,

1188
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,320
sees my brother--

1189
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,280
Vegas.

1190
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,000
...playing pool.

1191
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,200
Invites him in the back room,
says Dancer's going down.

1192
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,160
Vegas has got his own
beef with Dancer, right?

1193
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,760
Contract for 20,000? My brother
says he'll do it for ten.

1194
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,720
What about the other
guys, says Clyde.

1195
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,240
What about the other guys,
says my brother.

1196
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,080
I-I-- I still
don't get it, though.

1197
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,240
They drive back out
to Dancer's.

1198
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,840
Opens the door.
Oh, shit.

1199
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,000
Shorts, T-shirt.

1200
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,760
Vegas shoots him in the face.

1201
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,640
Steps over the body,

1202
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,480
goes upstairs,
kills the wife and kids,

1203
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:06,000
in and out, five minutes.

1204
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,800
End of story.

1205
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,760
Wow. Um--
[clears throat]

1206
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,280
All right. So, uh,

1207
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,280
All right.

1208
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
[chuckling]
Great story.

1209
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,320
All right. Private,

1210
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,800
what would you say
would be the lesson

1211
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,200
that we have
learned here today?

1212
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,400
Uh, the lesson is that,
when you're on a mission,

1213
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,080
a deadly mission--

1214
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,640
Deadly mission.

1215
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,960
It's all about having
the right mix of guys.

1216
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,840
And in that mix, there's
got to be the wild card.

1217
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,800
Vegas was the wild card.

1218
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
And so am I.

1219
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,840
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.

1220
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,240
And what has become
of the wild card, Vegas?

1221
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,320
He's dead.

1222
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,320
He died in prison.

1223
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,320
Jesus.
He got caught?

1224
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,600
Took about, what, 24 hours.

1225
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,040
Cops come knocking
on Clyde's door,

1226
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,120
they flip him,
go to the bar,

1227
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,840
find Vegas--

1228
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,840
Only takes one fucking rat
to bring the whole house down.

1229
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,880
Jesus, dude. What are you
looking at me for?

1230
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,560
I'm sorry.

1231
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,360
You know, my mom always told
me it was impolite to stare.

1232
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,000
Come on, dude.

1233
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,080
I mean, what about
the other guys?

1234
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,600
[chuckles]

1235
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,400
What about the other guys?

1236
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Well, McCoy didn't
see nothing.

1237
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,400
And Angel--

1238
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,720
Well, kind of
lost his head.

1239
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,400
<i>[electronically altered]
I am making this video</i>

1240
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,560

1241
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,640

1242
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,760
<i>I'm hiding my identity

1243
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,800

01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,640
<i>and the Department
of Defense,</i>

1245

1246
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,400

1247
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,920

1249
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,680

1250
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,840

1251
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,120

1254
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,760
<i>everything is absolutely true.</i>

1255
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,920
<i>When I was stationed
in the Middle East,</i>

1256
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,760
<i>two men from my squad
raped and killed</i>

1257
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,080

1260
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,840
<i>I'm posting this

1261
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,560

1262
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,000

1263
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,320
<i>bring this forward, and
bring this out into the light.</i>

1264
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,640
Did you see the woman
being raped?

1265
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,400
Yeir. Well, uh,
not really.

1266
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,760
Rush was holding her down
when I went outside.

1267
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,400
Well, to do what?
To get away.

1268
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,800
I didn't think they were
actually going to do it.

1269
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,240
How did you know her?

1270
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,000
Flake put a gun in my face
and told me to go on watch.

1271
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,280
How did you know her?

1272
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,440
She would go in and out
of our checkpoint every day.

1273
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,200
Rush would take a little
extra time with her.

1274
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,680
Said he was just
being thorough.

1275
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,200
And why did you
make this assumption

1276
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,120
that she was a girl
and not a woman?

1277
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,760
Because she was
younger than that.

1278
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,360
She didn't look that old,
so I just assumed that she--

1279
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,640
Wasn't she an insurgent,
resisting arrest?

1280
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,640
[chuckles]
Uh, no. No.

1281
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,200
She was just a girl.
She was scared to death.

1282
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,320
How do you know
she wasn't scared to death

1283
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,160
because she was an insurgent
resisting arrest?

1284
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,680
Because, um,

1285
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,640
Flake said that we were
going to get this girl

1286
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,840
and "have a little fun."

1287
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,720
Oh, that's new.
When did he say that?

1288
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,840
He said it when we were
playing poker one night.

1289
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,280
I thought he was
just kidding around.

1290
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,960
Did you see Flake
rape her?

1291
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,680
No, I told you.
I went outside.

1292
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,160
So what did you see?
I didn't see him ra--

1293
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,960
I heard some shots.
I heard some screams.

1294
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,000
Then what happened?
Then I went up the stairs,

1295
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,240
and I saw Salazar, and he
told me what happened inside.

1296
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,040
You didn't actually
see him shoot her.

1297
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,640
No, but Flake had a gun
pointed at her head--

1298
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,240
So did Salazar and Rush
have guns?

1299
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,520
Yes, sir. Rush had a gun.
Did you have a gun?

1300
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,400
Yes, sir, I did. Couldn't
Rush have shot her?

1301
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,440
No! I--
Couldn't you have shot her?

1302
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,720
I didn't shoot the girl.

1303
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,080
But when you saw her,
she was still alive.

1304
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,800
I told you. I didn't
go back inside.

1305
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,840
Salazar said-- We're not
interested in what Salazar said.

1306
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,040
We're interested in
what you saw.

1307
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,080
Flake shot her
in the face!

1308
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,120
So you believed
she was dead.

1309
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,760
Yes! I believed
she was dead.

1310
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,560
But you didn't
see him shoot her.

1311
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,760
No, but I didn't know--

1312
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,240
And you didn't
see him rape her.

1313
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,440
No, but that's
not the point!

1314
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,840
What is the point?

1315
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,080
Isn't your testimony that you
were outside keeping watch?

1316
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,200
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to see it,

1317
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,080
and I didn't want
to be a part of it.

1318
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:51,880
Why don't you believe me?

1319
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,720
This is the scene

1320
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,320
of one of the most
shocking crimes

1321
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,760
alleged to have been
carried out

1322
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,880
by American
soldiers in Iraq.

1323
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,960
According to evidence
at the hearing,

1324
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,800
one July evening,
four U.S. soldiers

1325
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,240
came to this house here.

1326
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,000
According to Lawyer McCoy's
statement,

1327
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,440
Reno Flake and B.B. Rush

1328
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,800
repeatedly raped
a 15-year-old girl.

1329
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,760
In another room,

1330
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,320
the girl's grandfather,
mother, and little sister

1331
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,720
were shot dead.

1332
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,280
This man, Private Reno Flake,

1333
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,560
is accused of committing
all the murders.

1334
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,360
His accomplice,
B.B. Rush, was taken--

1335
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,760
[Rush]
We were securing the area.

1336
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,080
We checked everyone
and everything.

1337
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,000
And that girl went in
and out of our checkpoint

1338
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,800
again and again.

1339
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,800
So, yeah, I checked
her thoroughly.

1340
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,160
Every fucking time, because there
was something fishy about her.

1341
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,400
"Fishy"? What exactly do you
mean by fishy, Specialist Rush?

1342
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,120
Fishy, fishy, like
she was up to something.

1343
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,120
And I'll deal you
one more card.

1344
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,760
It's angel faces
like hers

1345
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,720
that are going to walk right up to
you and give you a great big smile,

1346
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,640
and then blow you
the fuck apart.

1347
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,360
And sure as shit,
the next day,

1348
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,280
the very
next fucking day,

1349
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,800
one of my best buddies

1350
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,920
got torched on a path that
she just walked right over.

1351
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,640
Didn't miss a beat.

1352
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,720
So don't you dare sit there
for one second and think

1353
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,000
that she didn't know where
that fuckin' IED was planted.

1354
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,400
[Flake chuckles]

1355
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,760
You know, I went back
to the house because

1356
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,560
I knew they were hiding
weapons and shit?

1357
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,240
I mean, hell,
that old man,

1358
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:44,040
broken back, tried to
shoot me with an AK-47.

1359
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,560
You know-- Hey--

1360
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,800
It really
pisses me off, sir,

1361
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,960
when I think of everything

1362
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,240
we've done for these
sand niggers?

1363
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:53,120
Got rid of Saddam,
planted democracy,

1364
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,920
giving up our lives to keep them
safe from their own insurgents,

1365
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,600
and I'm not looking
for a thank-you, but--

1366
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,800
I want them to stop
trying to kill us!

1367
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,560
Mm-hmm. Did you
find these weapons

1368
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,160
before or after
you raped the girl?

1369
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,840
Raped?

1370
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,160
I mean--

1371
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,280
<i>That hajji bitch
was all over me.</i>

1372
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,080
What, bombing and shooting them is okay,

1373
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,200
but fucking them
isn't.

1374
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,600
I mean,
who-- who says--

1375
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,200
Do you say?

1376
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,400
Who says their pussies
aren't better

1377
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,560
than their
hearts and minds?

1378
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,280
Would you answer
the question, Pratt?

1379
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,480
This is bullshit.

1380
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,600
Just a, you know--

1381
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:37,920
It's
a dog and pony show

1382
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,360
for the folks
back home, right?

1383
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,440
I'm just one of those
bad apples, huh?

1384
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,680
Soldiers
like B.B. Rush and I?

1385
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,560
We're keeping the Arab
scum off your doorstep.

1386
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,600
We shouldn't be in here
answering this crap.

1387
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,720
Let me tell you
something, sir.

1388
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,240
We should be out,
doing our job,

1389
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,000
boots on the ground,

1390
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,160
finding the bad guys,

1391
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,360
putting two in the heart
and one in the head,

1392
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,480
keeping America safe

1393
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,840
and making sure
the motherfucker's dead.

1394
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,720
You prosecute
guys like us.

1395
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,640
You're just aiding
the terrorists.

1396
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,320
<i>A quick death...</i>

1397
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,760
<i>is too good
for this brainwashed,</i>

1398
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,400
<i>racist Nazi fuck.</i>

1399
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,840
<i>This stormtrooper needs
to be stripped naked</i>

1400
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,040
<i>and strung up by his feet.</i>

1401
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,560
<i>Then, what's left
of the family--</i>

1402
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,280
<i>you know,
the ones he didn't shoot</i>

1403
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,720
<i>or set on fire--</i>

1404
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,840
<i>the family of that
poor little girl</i>

1405
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,960
<i>should be given
baseball bats,</i>

1406
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,880
<i>white-hot branding irons,</i>

1407
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,120
<i>blow torches,
dull knives, pliers,</i>

1408
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,840
<i>and, of course, rocks,</i>

1409
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,240
<i>and be told
to go to town!</i>

1410
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,200
<i>This is the same monster</i>

1411
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,840
<i>immortalized in every
fucking movie about Vietnam.</i>

1412
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,320
<i>"Let's do the whole
fucking village!"</i>

1413
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,760
<i>You don't see the My Lai
massacre in the movies</i>

1414
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,520
<i>because the truths
of that fascist orgy</i>

1415
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,160
<i>are just too hellish for even
liberal Hollywood to cop to.</i>

1416
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,600
<i>Oh, but that doesn't
stop them</i>

1417
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,360
<i>making another movie
about 9/11</i>

1418
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,720
<i>because an American life
is worth so much more</i>

1419
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,640
<i>than a Vietnamese,
a Palestinian,</i>

1420
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,240
<i>a Lebanese,
or an Iraqi life</i>

1421
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,560
<i>because we
are the uber race.</i>

1422
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,600
<i>Sieg heil, motherfucker!</i>

1423
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,240
[Man]
Oh. Okay. Okay, that's great.

1424
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,240
[giggling]

1425
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,480
All right. All right, now--

1426
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,040
Hey, McCoy--
Woman!

1427
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,240
...I'm not
getting your faces.

1428
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,400
Come on, I want you
to turn toward me.

1429
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Come on, come on.

1430
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,600
Look in the lens here.

1431
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,000
All right, all right,
all right.

1432
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,200
Hurry up.
Take your picture.

1433
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,400
ALl right, here we go.

1434
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,000
Ready? Come on. Face me.
Here we go.

1435
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,400
Here we go.

1436
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,800
Come on, Judy, look at me.

1437
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,560
Here we go. 1, 2--

1438
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,480
No, I got to go
fix my face.

1439
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,920
Your-- What?
Your face is fine.

1440
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,360
It's just--
I'll fix my lipstick.

1441
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,400
It's perfectly fine.

1442
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,920
You look great! Judy!

1443
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,120
Okay.

1444
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,560
How about a war story?

1445
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,560
Yeah, how about not?

1446
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,640
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

1447
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,680
There are no war stories.

1448
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,960
Tell us a war story.

1449
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,480
You don't want to hear
a war story.

1450
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Sure we do. Tell us
what you did out there.

1451
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,120
Did you kill
anybody?

1452
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,400
Come on!
Let's hear one.

1453
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,840
Do you want to hear
a war story?

1454
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,920
Absolutely.

1455
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,200
Do you really want
to hear a war story?

1456
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,360
Very much so.
Absolutely.

1457
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,000
All right. Here's
a war story for you.

1458
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,800
Uh...

1459
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,040
when I first went over there,

1460
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,920
to Afghanistan,

1461
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,440
I was, uh, I was all amped up
to kill for my country.

1462
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,440
I was ready to just kick
some ass, you know?

1463
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,600
Get some licks in for what
they did to the Towers.

1464
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,520
Just be a big fucking
war hero.

1465
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,320
[clapping] Right on! Yeah!

1466
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,360
I get over to Iraq,

1467
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,440
and man, it's just--

1468
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,920
it's just a totally
different story.

1469
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,800
You grow up really,
really fast over there

1470
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,120
because everything you see,

1471
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,080
everywhere you look
is just death,

1472
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,800
and it's suffering.

1473
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,440
And the killing
that I did do,

1474
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,320
it made me sick to my stomach

1475
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,640
because of these smells
and these sounds

1476
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,800
and these images.

1477
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,040
I have these-- these
snapshots in my brain

1478
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,320
that are burned
in there forever,

1479
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,640
and I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do about them.

1480
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,480
And what was I doing there?

1481
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,680
What was I
doing in a country

1482
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,320
that's done nothing
to me?

1483
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,200
Just following orders?
Bullshit. Bull shit.

1484
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,200
You better have a really
good fucking reason

1485
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,160
for one of your buddies
to die in your arms,

1486
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,760
to be blown up
right in front of you.

1487
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,720
A really good
fucking reason.

1488
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,280
And I saw some shit
there, man. I just--

1489
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,920
I just don't know how
I'm going to live with.

1490
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,800
I went on a raid
in Samarra.

1491
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,040
And two men from my unit

1492
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:08,760
raped and killed
a 15-year-old girl

1493
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,240
and burned her body.

1494
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,160
And I didn't do
anything to stop it.

1495
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,920
[soft voice]
Oh, no.

1496
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,440
No, no.

1497
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,040
This is a celebration
for a war hero.

1498
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,120
Come on, come on.
Celebration!

1499
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,080
To Lawyer McCoy!

1500
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,120
Come on, come on.

1501
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,080
And I'm going
to get my picture here.

1502
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,960
Okay. Okay. Okay, McCoy.
Here we go.

1503
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,640
Look at the camera.
Come on, Judy.

1504
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,320
Look at us here.
Here we go.

1505
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,440
1, 2, 3--

1506
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,760
[shutter clicks]

1507
