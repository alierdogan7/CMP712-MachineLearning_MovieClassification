<i>have you ever observed

22
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,971
- No, Your Majesty.
- Ah, well, that's your problem, you see?

23
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,640
You don't observe nature.

24
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,278
But all of God's mysteries and secrets

25
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,416

00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:05,359

In the tern's nest, one will see chicks.

00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:15,784
Tiny beaks open, crying for
mother bird to feed them.

29
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,255
You see, it is the same for England

30
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,259

Aye, Your Majesty. New Jersey.

33
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:31,281

00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,585
- Does she now?
- <i> Aye.</i>

35
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,889
And chirping more happily, I expect,

36
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:39,226

38
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,969

- Yes, Your Majesty.

42
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:57,299
- Your Majesty, a word?
- Not now, Bill!

Oh, yes, and I recall on one of those days

I am the one who collects.

70
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:24,479

Where has it gone? Where have you sent it?

106

Franklin in Paris?

America.

114
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,606
No, not America.

115
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:45,007

<i>This is an anonymous

140
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:18,976
and it's been circulating in the camp.

141
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,245
Look, it begins by laying the loss

142
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,813
of Philadelphia at your feet

143
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:24,681
and it concludes with
calling for your exile.

144
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:28,320
It compares you to the demon Ba'al.

145
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:30,153
There are rumors that Horatio Gates

146
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:32,020
and Charles Lee have
both written to Congress

147
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:34,423
to have you removed as
the commander-in-chief.

148
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,091
I requested an intelligence report

149
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,694
on the movements of the enemy

150
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:41,265

153
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:51,774
Then what do you see

154
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,775
Well, the...

155
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,644
sir, the city having just been taken,

156
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,245
I've not had time to
cultivate a source there yet.

157
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,015
New York, then.

158
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,684
You have had sufficient time to get a person

159
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:10,253
of intelligence inside that city.

160
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:12,354
The advice from whom would provide critical

161
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,756
should we move to retake it.

162
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,994
What is the status of their defense?

163
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:22,264
I depend on you

164
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:25,033

00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,602
Your man Culpeper on Long Island,

166
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,299
what word from him?

167
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,639
Well, it's... it's Culper, sir.

168
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:36,338
And it's still too
dangerous to make contact.

169
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:41,505
I require a full report on New York
Harbor before we move camp.

170

171

Yes. Yes, sir.

00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,565
Come on!

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,735
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!

183
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,905
Drinks on me, fellas.

184
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,774
What did I tell you? Huh?

185
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:22,743
What did I tell you? Right here.

186
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:25,379
(Speaking Oneida) Right?

187
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:28,414
I assume you put in the proper
request for all these supplies?

188
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,248
Huh? Request? No.

189
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,085
No, these are my gifts for the cause.

190
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,689
Oh, I see. The black market, then.

191
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,092
Yeah, you do see.

192
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:42,532
Well, perhaps you might be getting the itch

193
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,867
to make another trade tonight.

194
00:09:43,902 --> 00:09:46,502
Maybe visit our old hometown,

195
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:48,338
visit an old friend.

196
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,674
Nah, not tonight.

197
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,077
I... I'm afraid this is
not a request, Caleb.

198
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,179
It is an order.

199
00:09:58,213 --> 00:09:59,946
- An order?
- That's right.

200
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,614
I think I'm done with those.

201
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,418
- Done?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,087
What, done with orders?

203
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:08,790
Orders, Culper, army.

204
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:11,827
I mean, it's all a bit
of a tail chaser, yeah?

205
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,229
But with this here, whale oil,

206
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,931
plucked from a fat Tory
skiff off of New Haven

207
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,434
and resold for ã12 on Devil's Belt...

208
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:23,069
that's the kind of profit that can make
a man think about quitting the army

209
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,605
and applying to Congress
for a license to privateer.

210
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,179
Loyal subjects harass at my pleasure

211
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:35,978
and make a bit of coin on the side.

212
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,144
And the best part... the best part

213
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,980
is the only one I'm risking

214
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,647
is me.

215
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,014
Han Yerry! (laughs)

216
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:48,913
Look, Caleb, this is not my order.

217
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:52,183
- It's Washington's.
- Oh, Washington.

218
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,552
Well, you'll just have to tell him
that you're following protocol.

219
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:57,418
See, Culper doesn't signal unless it's safe,

220
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,154
and he ain't signaled in two months.

221
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,222
- So it ain't safe.
- Caleb, listen to me.

222
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,622
I am listening, Ben.

223
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,325
I'm listening now like I
should have listened before.

224
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:08,358
Like when you ordered to let Simcoe live,

225
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,895
I should have listened to reason
and put my hatchet in his head.

226
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,696
But I didn't.

227
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,599
And he survived long
enough to kill my uncle.

228
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,236
Now that's on me.

229
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,970
You want to get Abe killed?

230
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,905
That's on you.

231
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,408
Caleb.

232
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,949
<i>(Music playing)</i>

233
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,354
Two more here

234
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,355
and we shall collect
whatever drinking glasses

235
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,558
guests used during hors d'oeuvres
before we seat for dinner.

236
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,326
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:48,760
<i>(Soft chatter)</i>

238
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,128
- Circle, circle.
- (Chuckles)

239
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,529
Everything comes round.

240
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,633
Thomas, do be careful with Grandfather.

241
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,164
- Don't lean on him so.
- He's fine. So am I.

242
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,432
You're still recovering.

243
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,799
Mary, there is perfection
and then there is obsession.

244
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,534
Whitehall has been without a
wife's care for far too long.

245
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,471
And that was before it became home
to soldiers and bachelors alike.

246
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:13,003
Well, I think you've done a miracle.

247
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:15,874
I agree. In fact, I was
trying to relate to Sarah

248
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,874
the extraordinary circumstance
of your journey here,

249
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,977
<i>but I just couldn't do it justice.</i>

250
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:24,514
Will you please tell Sarah
the story of the rebel raid?

251
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:27,283
<i>The night they burned your husband's farm.</i>

252
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,921
If only as an example
of how to survive such.

253
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:32,989
We've had no raids in Oyster Bay,

254
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:35,324
not since the regulars took the island.

255
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,495
And we're as safe here on Long Island

256
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,200
as any can hope to be in the colonies.

257
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:46,069
But these rebels, they have no fear.

258
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,874
Or they have so much, they're numb to it.

259
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,377
<i>They feel as if they have</i>

260
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:56,547
<i>nothing left to lose and
they hate us who do.</i>

261
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:02,921
So after Ben Tallmadge made
his retreat from our town,

262
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,920
some of his men stayed behind

263
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:07,089
to plunder what they could on the way out.

264
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,022
Abraham and I thought they'd gone.

265
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,259
<i>And so we returned home that night.</i>

266
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,926
<i>Abe had just taken Thomas out to the privy.</i>

267
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,327
<i>We were spent and just wanted to sleep</i>

268
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>when five men showed up</i>

269
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,692
<i>vowing revenge on the son of the magistrate.</i>

270
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:29,430
Brave Ensign Baker stood against all five.

271
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:32,295
And they shot him dead.

272
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,029
- (Gunshot)
- <i> (Mary screams)</i>

273
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,296
Mr. Baker!

274
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,529
Mary: <i>They couldn't find Abraham</i>

275
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,932
<i>as he was protecting Thomas.</i>

276
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:50,735
<i>So they set fire to the house and fled.</i>

277
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,082
How awful. Everything gone.

278
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,950
No, not everything.

279
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:25,686
<i>We had each other.</i>

280
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:28,721
<i>And together, Abraham and I
have vowed to move forward</i>

281
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,123
<i>and leave the past where it lay.</i>

282
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:49,196
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- <i> (Chatter, laughter)</i>

283
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,082
Mr. DeJong calling for you.

284
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,917
Thank you, Cicero.

288
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:21,006
Ah, Anna. More jugs, please.

<i>(Man urinating)</i>

291
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:29,145
And, deary,

292
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,481
could you be dearier and empty this

293
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,381
on your travels? (laughs)

294
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,915
How about I save time and refill right here?

295
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,882
Your ale's likely superior
to what we've got stocked.

296
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,715

297
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:48,322
Oh, Major. Welcome.

(Music stops)

299
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,923
Is there a problem?

300
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,459
A problem?

301
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:59,461
No, I simply wish to drink an ale.

302
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,866
Anna, an ale for the major.

303
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,866
Two. Op-op.

304
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,766
I actually have a matter to
discuss with Mrs. Strong.

305
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,934
If you could procure the drink,
Mr. DeJong, that would be helpful.

306
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:17,040
(Sloshes)

307
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,143
<i>(music resumes)</i>

308
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:22,378
Um, Mary Woodhull is hosting a dinner,

309
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:25,514
you see, at Whitehall.

310
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:29,050
And, well, you see, she's been
trying to do so for the past month.

311
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:31,287
Host a dinner in my honor, that is.

312
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:34,820
As fortune would have it for Mrs.
Woodhull and indeed the rest of us,

313
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,922
the capture of Philadelphia

314
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,090
is a victory worth celebrating,

315
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,292
<i>and celebrate we shall tonight.</i>

316
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,593
And I would be honored

317
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,928
to escort you there as my guest.

318
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:50,665
- Me?
- You.

319
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:54,000
- With you?
- With me.

Uh, not...

Allow me to... this is not a...

gesture or an advance in any way.

323
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:12,648
I sincerely wish to honor

324
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:14,750
the loyalty and the bravery that you showed

325
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,619
on the day that you leapt
from your rebel captors.

326
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,856
I betrayed my husband, sir.

327
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,890
<i>It was his boat I jumped from.</i>

328
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:29,960
You chose loyalty to your king.

329
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:32,961
There can be no nobler sacrifice.

330
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,165
I doubt the Woodhulls will see it that way.

331
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,536
It was Abraham who reminded
me of your right action

332
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,104
and who inspired me to take my own.

333
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:45,636
Abraham Woodhull

334
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,772
suggested you invite me to his home?

335
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,743
No, that was my idea.

336
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,810
But he did acknowledge the difficulties
that your families have had

337
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:55,977
and felt that it's time for all differences

338
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,381
to be put aside and for common
bonds to be strengthened.

339
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:03,545
His words, not mine.

340
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,821
(Music playing)

341
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,691
- Good evening.
- A pleasure.

342
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,692
Mr. DeJong.

343
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,529
Father, please sit down. Mary
and I can greet the guests.

344

I'm fine. Will you please
stop fussing, Abraham?

345

- Absolutely.

I'll... I'll help you, Father.

355
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:59,477
Major, perhaps a viewing of the Loch Lomond.

356
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:02,048
Hmm. Mrs. Strong, would you care

357
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,452
to view Loch Lomond before
dinner gets underway?

358
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,718
There's nothing like it in
Setauket. You really should.

359
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,720
By all means, then.

360
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,722
This way.

361
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:22,693
Father.

362
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:25,296
The major wants to chime in on
the wine choice for tonight.

363
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,496
We have Madeira, claret, and Virginia white.

364
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,564
He can arrange them in
whatever sequence he wishes.

365
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:31,732
All right, don't kill the messenger.

366
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,501
No, actually, pork.

367
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:36,305
- Who is the artist?
- Jacob More.

368
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:38,108
Specializing in portraiture,

369
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:41,379
but a trip to Florence has
broadened his intentions, it seems,

370
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:45,484
and perhaps made him long for home.

371
00:20:45,518 --> 00:20:47,550
(Knocks)

372
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:49,553
Major, our esteemed magistrate

373
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,488
wishes you to consult on a wine strategy.

374
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:53,991
(Chuckles) Ah, indeed.

375
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,827
To battle, then.

376
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,197
Ah, ah.

377
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,338
- Signal Caleb.
- What?

378
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,440
- Where have you been?
- She's been watching.

379
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:13,573
- If not her, then her sewing circle.
- It's been over a month.

380
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,842
I've hado play my part, but I'm ready now.

381
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:17,744
For what?

382
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,613
This is for Ben.

383
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,645
It's instructions for a new code book.

384
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,648
It explains about Ensign Baker.

385
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,685
How he found the book, how I shot him,

386
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,985
how I fired my farm and said
Tallmadge's men were to blame.

387
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,484
You want to tell Ben the truth?

388
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,822
- What about Mary?
- Everything except Mary.

389
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:33,657
Excuse me.

390
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,995
Abe:<i> If Washington finds out that she
knows, he may think me compromised.</i>

391
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,799
You are compromised. She does know.

392
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,266
Just take it to the drop.

393
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,836
Signal Caleb. I have the rest in hand.

394
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,606
Wait.

395
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:51,613
It's a stiletto blade.

396
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,957
I have to get used to
wearing it under the suit.

397
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:02,728
It's the one I'll be taking to New York.

398
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:05,266
New York? How?

399
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,402
You've no cabbage to
sell and no hogs to trade

400
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:09,338
as you've burned your bridges
with the quartermaster.

401
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,141
What excuse could you possibly...

402
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:15,580
You'll see tonight.

403
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,113
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

404
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,257
<i>(door opens)</i>

405
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,799
- (chatter)
- (Clinking glass)

406
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,734
- <i> (chatter stops)</i>
- Ah.

407
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:52,239
Tonight we celebrate the
victories in our king's name

408
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:56,077
and we honor the sacrifice
made along the way.

409
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:59,613
This year I learned the power of loss.

410
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,085
And I'm not speaking of my farm,

411
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,720
but of when I nearly lost
my father to a rebel bullet

412
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,723
and our town nearly lost its magistrate.

413
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:11,293
A possibility which
should terrify all of you

414
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,961
considering it was I who had
to prosecute in his stead.

415
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:16,132
- You performed admirably.
- Father, I lost the case.

416
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,803
That happens. Not to me so much, but...

417
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,771
(all laughing)

418
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:23,508
No.

419
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,611
Loss begets gain.

420
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,344
It inspires change.

421
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:30,244
<i>Your near loss pushed me
to take up the law again</i>

422
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,614
and my loss at trial
pushed me to want to win.

423
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,881
Especially against those who rape

424
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,451
and murder in the name of independence.

425
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:42,618
My toast to you tonight is a promise.

426
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:47,892
I am to finish what I
began at King's College.

427
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,222
<i>I aim to study the law by your example.</i>

428
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:54,659
And come one day,

429
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,229
I will set out for New York

430
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:58,964
to seek an apprenticeship to a barrister.

431
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,200
And even if it takes me a
year of going there and back,

432
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:05,037
I will see it through.

433
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:07,073
I've found my calling.

434
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,613
And you have made your father very proud.

435
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,815
Hewlett: <i>Hear, hear. Hear, hear.</i>

436
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:14,882
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

437
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,751
<i>Shall we eat? Let's eat.</i>

438
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:19,856
(voices echo)

439
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,698
No, no. I... no. I'm sorry.

440
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,934
I'm sorry, Abraham. I can't let you do that.

441
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:34,070
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,543
Mary, what are you...
what are you talking about?

443
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,745
You know why you can't go to New York.

444
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:51,116
The rebels burned your farm.
They shot your father.

445
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,318
You are the son of the magistrate

446
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:55,219
and they hate you for that.

447
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:58,056
You were a target of the
Patriots and they will try again.

448
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,460
(Stammering) You think that
I'm in danger of some kind?

449
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:05,096
There have been tales of... of kidnapping

450
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:07,232
<i>and killing of prominent Tories</i>

451
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,801
all over Long Island.

452
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:12,070
Ensign Baker died defending your farm.

453
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:13,939
<i>You yourself were beaten and robbed</i>

454
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,441
on the way to York City and
you wish to try again alone?

455
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,177
Mary.

456
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,212
I agree with you, madam.

457
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:23,983
<i>And that is why I shall
guarantee his safety.</i>

458
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:26,319
He shall be granted an escort.

459
00:25:26,353 --> 00:25:27,754
Richard: <i>Now that is wise.</i>

460
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:30,255
I hire two every trip.

461
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,329
No, Major, I couldn't possibly
afford to pay for such a...

462
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:35,830
There is no need.

463
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,730
I shall provide a top
man from my own regiment

464
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:40,467
<i>who will go with you to the
city and stay by your side</i>

465
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:42,170
<i>till your journey is over.</i>

466
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:44,338
<i>That way, all of our
minds can be put at ease.</i>

467
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:47,605
No, I do not need...
I do not need an escort.

468
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,476
There's no shame in it. It's
a dangerous world out there.

469
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:56,479
Thank you, sir. That's
very generous of you, sir.

470
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,579
It is my pleasure.

471
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,781
It's done. Let's eat.

472
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:06,685
- Hewlett: <i>Worth waiting for.</i> 
- Richard:<i> Yes, isn't it?</i>

473
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,458
"I believe that it is better
to die honorably in the field

474
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,572
- than in a stinking hospital." 
- I concur with that.

475
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:18,373
Men: Cheers.

476
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:21,488
And this, this here, truer still.

477
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:24,857
Listen. "I believe that the
proper methods of attacking,

478
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:26,527
beating and conquering the enemy

479
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,198
has never as yet been adopted
by the commander-in-chief."

480
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,602
I couldn't have said it better myself, boys.

481
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,272
Who do you think is the author?

482
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:34,941
<i>Someone fed up,</i>

483
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,878
armed with common sense and
the courage to speak out.

484
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:39,616
Oi, Bradford.

485
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,255
You might want to be more careful with that.

486
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:45,187
Your anonymous hero makes common sense

487
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,889
sound a bit like treason.

488
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:48,860
<i>That's your commander</i> <i>that he's hacking at.</i>

489
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:50,599
Not for much longer, I think.

490
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,067
What? What did you just say?

491
00:26:56,873 --> 00:27:00,940
This letter is well-formed
opinion based on fact.

492
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:03,609
<i>Our esteemed commander</i>

493
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:06,247
left his flank wide open at Brandywine.

494
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:09,683
He lost the battle, cost
America her capital city.

495
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,318
Is it treason to speak the
facts in this army now?

496
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:14,919
Fine. So...

497
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,584
who would you see as commander?

498
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,352
Congress would likely choose Gates.

499
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,155
Gates, right.

500
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,826
Sure, or perhaps your man

501
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:27,032
- Charles Lee.
- Stand back.

502
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:30,168
Who was captured while
with his mistress... fact.

503
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,138
Who escaped the enemy on his own.

504
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,376
What was she, a tavern wench?

505
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,445
No wonder he's been so absent in the field.

506
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,547
He's too busy playing with his whore pipe.

507
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,317
At least he has one.
And the sons to prove it.

508
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:44,389
While poor George must content
himself with collecting young men.

509
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,459
Why, you...

510
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,474
Hold him down. Hold him down.

511
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,446
Now we're gonna shut that pretty mouth.

512
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,115
With respect, sir,

513
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,250
the only one who punches my friend is me.

514
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,484
Hey.

515
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,586
(Groans)

516
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,895
You like that, huh?

517
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,105
(Spits)

518
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:31,117
Wait, Caleb. Hey there, boy.

519
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:35,861
Thank you.

520
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,564
And you were right. You
were right about Culper.

521
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,301
It's not safe to make
contact unless he's signaled.

522
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:45,638
I won't move without you, all right?

523
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:50,109
Are you all right?

524
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,812
Yeah, it's just a scratch.

525
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,983
Are you all right, though?

526
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,155
What, have I really been such an ass?

527
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:02,392
Well, yeah. You have.

528
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:03,994
(laughs)

529
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,832
I wish I could just walk up
and ask that of Washington.

530
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,631
"Are you all right, sir?"

531
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:11,369
The man won't stand up for
himself against his detractors.

532
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:14,471
I cannot for the life of me understand why.

533
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,576
Well, you know these officer types.

534
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,345
Hmm?

535
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:21,877
Always under pressure, shouldering burdens

536
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,549
us foot-wobblers don't know or can't see.

537
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:26,285
Huh?

538
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,685
Maybe give him some slack.

539
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,227
(Singing drunkenly)

540
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:36,929
Shh. Thomas.

541
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:38,934
I just don't understand, Richard,

542
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:40,871
why we haven't done this before.

543
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,206
You didn't want to be celebrated.

544
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,610
Ah, well, I am lifting the embargo on that.

545
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:50,378
In the meantime, God night.

546
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:53,515
- And good bless.
- (Laughs)

547
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,816
Where's Thomas?

548
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,952
He's asleep downstairs. Aberdeen's with him.

549
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:30,021
Don't you think we should talk?

550
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:33,224
I think everyone had a splendid evening.

551
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:35,492
Just a splendid evening, wouldn't you agree?

552
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:37,626
<i>Almost everyone.</i>

553
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,627
<i>Well, I know I did.</i>

554
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:42,665
Dinner, drinks, and the
theater all in one night.

555
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:46,067
I thought your performance was excellent.

556
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:48,134
I learned from the best.

557
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:49,667
Touché.

558
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:54,105
(Clears throat)

559
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,782
An armed escort with me at all times.

560
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:04,350
Very clever.

561
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:08,786
Abraham, please.

562
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,222
I don't feel very clever and I
don't wish to be your adversary.

563
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:13,761
Oh, no, don't be hasty
'cause you got a talent for it.

564
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:15,232
And I mean that to your credit.

565
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,599
You're much more than the blushing rose

566
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,132
my brother first told me about.

567
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,800
And you, you are a far
more interesting husband

568
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,536
than the cabbage farmer that I was wed to.

569
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,871
Well, then we make a
perfect couple, don't we?

570
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:31,409
If you hate me, just say it straight out.

571
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:33,977
There's no longer a need to be
hiding the truth from each other.

572
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,678
We've both suffered the consequence of that.

573
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:44,650
You're a God-fearing man.
I know that, Abraham.

574
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:48,286
Our savior has tested us and
has given us a second chance.

575
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,219
And I had hoped and I had prayed

576
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,654
that the death of Ensign Baker, a good man,

577
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:54,491
- an innocent man...
- Mary, we're...

578
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,257
would have opened your eyes
to the folly of these schemes.

579
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,726
We are not talking about
Ensign Baker right now.

580
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,496
Did his death mean nothing to you?

581
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,999
No, his death meant everything!
It changed everything!

582
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:06,603
I had tried at every step to do right,

583
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:09,905
to protect my family,
to stand for my principles,

584
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:11,609
to stay out of the fight and true to myself.

585
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,977
And Baker is the bloody
proof that I cannot do both.

586
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:17,811
Now, if I stop now, his
death will mean nothing.

587
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:19,580
Abraham, please, you're hurting me.

588
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:21,282
He should never have been in our house

589
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,750
just as Hewlett should not be now.

590
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,251
We do not need their laws,

591
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:25,786
their taxes, or their protection.

592
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,457
And I will not stop my
mission for Washington

593
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,393
until the last king's man
has set sail back to England.

594
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,394
Now, do you understand?

595
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,035
Who will protect us from King Louis

596
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:40,670
when his ships return to reclaim New France?

597
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,104
You've been speaking to my father again.

598
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:43,606
You asked what I believe in.

599
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,273
Then why don't you just turn me in?

600
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:48,240
Abraham, don't you know?

601
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:51,245
Sometime during that night while
I was watching our house burn,

602
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,049
it became clear to me
and it brought me peace.

603
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,686
I love you, Abraham.

604
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:01,889
I love your strength to stand on your own

605
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:04,493
no matter what anyone else thinks.

606
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:07,197
I love the way that you care for our son.

607
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:11,136
I love your lips and I love your eyes.

608
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,272
And I will do what I must to protect you.

609
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:19,775
Even if that means
protecting you from yourself.

610
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,276
Mary...

611
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:28,148
I don't feel the same.

612
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,949
I know.

613
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,650
I know.

614
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,921
It's not as bad as I feared.

615
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:44,725
And I did fear that for so long.

616
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:54,101
You may go to New York to
study the law, Abraham.

617
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:57,071
But I'm afraid that's all
you'll have time for there.

618
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,231
- Woodhull.
- Corporal Eastin.

619
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,569
On your way to post?

620
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:27,235
You are my post.

621
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,972
I'm your new escort per Major Hewlett.

622
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,376
Oh, excellent. I see.

623
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,214
Well, when I'm ready to travel,
I'll be sure to let you know.

624
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,615
My orders are to not
let you out of my sight.

625
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:42,249
For your own safety.

626
00:34:42,283 --> 00:34:45,019
I think I'm safe here in Setauket.

627
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:49,058
Are you?

628
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,875
(Chatter)

629
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:14,881
"That the enemy has been greatly deceived

Tell me, monsieur,

634
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:29,807
do you have gutter
journalists in your country?

635
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:35,082
In France we would have
them thrown in the Bastille.

636
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:38,753
General Lee, what do you read there?

637
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,157
Lee: <i>What, this?</i>

638
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:45,130
Just a complaint, sir.

639
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:47,565
<i>Factional, anonymous.</i>

640
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,833
You don't want to read it, trust me.

641
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:51,800
You read it, then.

642
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,068
Please.

who wrote this grub shite,

not the equal of a commander

00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:09,935
General Benedict Arnold.

687
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,103
General, this is Theveneau de Francy

688
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:16,108
of the Roderigue Hortalez Company.

689
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,412
Bonjour.

690
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,881
Will you join us, General?

691
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,822
Oh, sir, please.

692
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:35,166
It is an honor, sir.

693
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,906
Do you still have an appetite?

694
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,405
Always.

<i>(Thunder crashing)</i>

696
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:04,181
There is something I did not say

697

when I made my proposal to go to New York.

698
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:11,085
Something I kept hidden
and you should know it.

699
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,655
You should know that I intended

700
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,754
to undertake a completely different task.

701
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,526

What you may not know,

705
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,277
while at King's I had a connection.

706
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,883
A shameful, misguided friendship

707
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:43,052
with several members of a
secret group of Patriots.

708
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:47,824
They called themselves the Sons of Liberty.

709
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:51,761
It's not a past that I am proud of.

710
00:39:53,364 --> 00:39:55,432
But it is one that could be of use now.

711
00:40:01,308 --> 00:40:03,172
You were right

712
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:04,974
<i>about the danger that we face.</i>

713
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:07,879
<i>There are traitors everywhere.</i>

714
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,083
Now I wish to uproot them from the ground

715
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,185
before they strike my family again.

716
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,122
Uproot them how?

717
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:18,028
I believe that the Sons of Liberty
may still be operating in New York,

718
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,663
albeit concealed underground.

719
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,932
If I can find them,

720
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,701
convince them that I'm still on their side,

721
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:30,108
I can deliver you the
names of the whole group.

722
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,341
You wish to act the Patriot?

723
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:38,345
In order to catch traitors,
I must play one myself, yes.

724
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:45,423
Of course, it...

725
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:49,094
it won't do to have Corporal Eastin
standing guard while I do so.

726
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:50,895
He may still accompany me to the city,

727
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:53,797
but in order to keep up appearances,

728
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,934
I must act alone.

729
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:59,370
Are not the Sons of Liberty

730
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:02,340
the same cabal that sparked
the Liberty Pole Riots?

731
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:06,510
The same men who murdered
your older brother Thomas?

732
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:08,980
Well, you see now why I must do this.

733
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:11,616
<i>And why I beg you not to tell my father.</i>

734
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,119
<i>He may never speak to me again
if he were to learn of my past.</i>

735
00:41:14,153 --> 00:41:16,554
He may never speak to you
again if you should die

736
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:19,157
while exposing the rebels or
while masquerading as one.

737
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,259
I will not sit home in safety and comfort

738
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:23,260
while others are dying for their beliefs.

739
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:25,363
I took an oath in your presence

740
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:28,234
swearing to defeat any treasonous
conspiracies made against the king.

741
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,569
Now, please...

742
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:34,705
let me fulfill my oath.

743
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,730
- <i> (Footsteps)</i>
- <i> (Horse neighs)</i>

744
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:01,032
A wee bit late for visitors, isn't it?

745
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:03,466
You wish to see His Majesty or not?

746
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,757
Your Majesty,

747
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,725
it is a most distinguishing honor

748
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,896
to stand in your royal presence once more.

749
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,068
I do hope you recall the warm spirit

750
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:50,740
of my prior audience just 14 years ago.

751
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:54,345
The same season you enjoyed my accounts

752
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,753
of the methods used to trap a black bear

753
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:01,858
in his winter den, eh? (laughs)

754
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:07,734
I also hope that you recall

755
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:10,338
<i>my petition.</i>

756
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:13,809
That being the discovery

757
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,876
of the Northwest Passage

758
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,980
and claiming it for England.

759
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:21,649
I humbly submit to you

760
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:24,150
this proposal tonight.

761
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:28,718
It is said that you are the best
hunter and tracker in America

762
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:31,119
and that you are a...

763
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:34,354
killing gentleman.

764
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:39,257
You will be granted a charter to
discover the Northwest Passage.

765
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,161
You will be appointed
command to raise troops.

766
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:45,527
<i>You will serve on full pay as a major.</i>

767
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:49,932
And all your debts will
be cleared by the Crown.

768
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:53,768
There is a valuable piece of royal property

769
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:56,237
on a ship bound for New York.

770
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:59,907
It is concealed inside a waxwork.

771
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,576
- Concealed?
- It was stolen from the palace,

772
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,012
and must be recovered before it falls

773
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:08,417
<i>into the hands of the rebel army.</i>

774
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:11,686
And it must never fall
into the hands of France.

775
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,556
Never.

776
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:18,324
You are to find it and destroy it

777
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,429
along with anyone else
that may have seen it.

778
00:44:42,325 --> 00:44:44,690
By my honor,

779
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,891
I will see it done.

780
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:58,230
- (chatter)
- (Seagulls screeching)

781
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:05,081
__

782
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:08,152
Abe's voice: <i>Brooklyn Ferry, October 14.</i>

783
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:10,930
<i>Troop number is lower since my last trip,</i>

784
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:12,765
<i>but naval presence still strong.</i>

785
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,705
<i>I count two dozen warships in the harbor,</i>

786
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,475
<i>including one ship of the line...</i>

787
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:21,377
<i>the Eagle, Lord Howe's
flagship with 60 guns.</i>

788
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:23,712
<i>The rest are lesser armed
frigates and sloops.</i>

789
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:25,245
Mr. Woodhull.

790
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,313
Abe's voice: <i>Land defenses on
the Brooklyn side include...</i>

791
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:28,914
- Mr. Woodhull, sir!
- Hmm?

792
00:45:28,948 --> 00:45:31,183
He wants your papers.

793
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:33,052
Oh, yeah.

794
00:45:35,157 --> 00:45:36,858
There you go.

795
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:40,895
As you can see, I have permission

796
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:42,930
from Major Hewlett of
Setauket to enter the city.

797
00:45:42,964 --> 00:45:46,034
"For legal studies," eh?

798
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:51,442
The next ferry should be here soon.

799
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:53,277
You can wait over there.

800
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,578
Don't see why I've got to lurk about here

801
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:58,315
when I could be getting my
Thomas milked in holy ground.

802
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:01,250
I'm afraid your pilgrimage
will have to wait.

803
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:02,984
My bag, please.

804
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:05,385
Seems odd you need
protecting all the way here

805
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,453
only to hoof it about alone in the city.

806
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,056
Makes me wonder what you're really up to

807
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,760
with your legal studies.

808
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:14,233
Don't wonder too hard.
You might hurt yourself.

809
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,436
My bag.

810
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:18,972
If Captain Simcoe were here...

811
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:21,475
Your orders are from Major
Hewlett, not Captain Simcoe.

812
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:22,776
And I suggest you follow them

813
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:25,011
unless you want to end up like him.

814
00:46:28,615 --> 00:46:30,919
- <i>(Distant applause)</i>
- <i>(Chatter)</i>

815
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:36,790
<i>(distant flute playing)</i>

816
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:45,393
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

817
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:51,295
- <i>(applause, cheering)</i>
- <i>(Feet marching)</i>

818
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,565
(gasps, growls)

819
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,172
Man: Your attention, please!

820
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:09,506
It seems we have a poet in our midst.

821
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:13,979
Shall we pause in our labors
to better appreciate his verse?

822
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,014
- Clerk: <i>Hear, hear. Yes.</i> 
- Ahem.

823
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:17,783
"Say,

824
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:21,723
must I all my joys forgo

825
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:24,490
and still maintain this outward show?"

826
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,328
- <i> (men laughing)</i>
- "Say,

827
00:47:26,363 --> 00:47:30,200
shall this breast that's pained to feel

828
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:33,202
be ever clad in horrid steel?

829
00:47:33,236 --> 00:47:36,905
<i>Shall no fair maid with equal fire</i>

830
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,712

Oh, dear.

836
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,840
What a mess you've made.

837
00:48:06,874 --> 00:48:09,307
All those forms will have to be redone.

838
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:11,508
This came for you.

839
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:14,209
Perhaps it's your true
love writing you back.

840
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,578
(laughs) Boys.

841
00:48:20,714 --> 00:48:22,480
Man: <i>God, I'm knackered.</i>

842
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:24,413
<i>(chatter)</i>

843
00:48:24,447 --> 00:48:26,047
<i>You should have seen this girl.</i>

844
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,516
<i>Voluptuous breasts. You know what I mean?</i>

845
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:31,449
<i>Right?</i> <i>(making squeaking noises)</i>

846

<i>(laughing)</i>

847
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:38,221
So, I showed her the silk.

848
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:40,057
Said there's more where that came from.

849
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:42,859
(Whistles) Never saw a woman
drop her knickers so fast.

850
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,332
You like to read aloud? Read this.

851
00:48:50,234 --> 00:48:51,569
"To whom it may concern."

852
00:48:51,603 --> 00:48:53,239
That'd be you. Pray continue.

853
00:48:53,273 --> 00:48:55,209
"Captain John Simcoe

and is ordered to report
posthaste to Major John André."

856
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:02,919
Posthaste. That means immediately.

857
00:49:02,954 --> 00:49:06,058
I'm afraid I won't be able
to finish today's forms.

858
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:10,428
Oh, dear. What a mess you've made.

859
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:12,498
Ah!

860
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:20,038

00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,571
<i>(music continues)</i>

864
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,162
Franklin calls it an armonica.

865
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,267
It mechanically recreates the tones

866
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:14,205
made by rubbing a wet finger
around the rim of a wine glass.

867
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:16,707
So he mechanized a parlor trick.

868
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:19,312
Perhaps, but this parlor

869
00:50:19,346 --> 00:50:21,915
is testament to the man's
genius and industry.

870
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,716
Take his lightning rod. Placed on a roof,

871
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,285
it guides the energy from a
bolt harmlessly to the ground.

872
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,953
And these eyeglasses.

873
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,486
The lenses are split,

874
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:33,688
offering corrections for both close

875
00:50:33,723 --> 00:50:35,726
and distant viewing.

876
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,493
You can have the house, John.

877
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:41,628
I had no idea you admired
the man so ardently.

878
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:44,126
What I admire is how he imposes no bounds

879
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:47,795
on either his curiosity or his invention.

880
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,396
And now he wants to invent
an alliance with France,

881
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:53,364
which could turn this little
rebellion into a genuine war.

882
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,000
Not if I have any say in the matter.

883
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:56,868
<i>(Door opens)</i>

884
00:50:56,903 --> 00:50:59,804
Ah, here are our libations.

885
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,273
Good. Enough anticipation.

886
00:51:03,307 --> 00:51:06,011
I'd like a report with my port.

887
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:10,449
<i>Starting with your mole in
the rebel camp, Charles Lee.</i>

888
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:13,585
(sighs)

889
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,089
I admit, General Lee was a poor investment.

890
00:51:16,123 --> 00:51:18,723
I may yet use him, but for now

891
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:20,757
I have my sights set on a bigger fish.

892
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,824
Thank you, Abigail. That'll be all.

893
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,164
André: <i>Trust me, General...</i>

894
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:36,603
I realized what we need
isn't a rival to Washington,

895
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,908
but a man who has his trust, a friend.

896
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:44,444
Indeed, such friends as only the
comradeship of war can make.

897
00:51:45,712 --> 00:51:48,181
And who might this friend be?

898
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:51,849
A man whose leadership inspires both respect

899
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:54,082
<i>and affection.</i>

900
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,018
General Benedict Arnold.

901
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:58,788
<i>(Scoffs) Ridiculous.</i>

902
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:01,491
Unlikely.

903
00:52:01,526 --> 00:52:04,263
Arnold is the best field
commander the rebels have.

904
00:52:04,297 --> 00:52:07,998
Yes, but as with many men driven
to succeed on the battlefield,

905
00:52:08,032 --> 00:52:10,800
his virtues are often matched by his flaws.

906
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:13,669
Consider this. It's a report
from one of my field agents

907
00:52:13,703 --> 00:52:17,673
detailing Arnold's role in
the rebel victory at Saratoga.

908
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,843
"We were on the verge of winning the battle

909
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:22,717
when Arnold, forced to
serve under General Gates,

910
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:24,284
<i>asked to lead a last charge.</i>

911
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,253
<i>When Gates ordered him to stay in camp,</i>

912
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,689
<i>Arnold disobeyed."</i>

913
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,559
Clinton: <i>The man is insubordinate.</i>

914
00:52:32,594 --> 00:52:34,660
(chuckles) To Burgoyne's misfortune.

915
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:36,429
"Ignoring a volley of fire,

916
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:39,466
<i>he single-handedly rallied the rebel troops,</i>

917
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,737
<i>turning a rout into a win."</i>

918
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:44,239
Clinton: <i>Poor Johnny Burgoyne.</i>

919
00:52:44,273 --> 00:52:46,241
<i>Whipped by an apothecary.</i>

920
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:51,047
But here's the rub. Gates took
full credit for the victory.

921
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:53,416
What did Arnold get for his troubles?

922
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,016
He was shot in the same leg

923
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,317
he'd already been wounded in twice before.

924
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,424
<i>It'll be some time before
Arnold sees another battlefield.</i>

925
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:09,726
Time enough for that wound to heal,

926
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:13,062
<i>but for the many slights to his vanity</i>

927
00:53:13,097 --> 00:53:15,268
to fester.

928
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:19,406
Well, supposing he is ripe for turning,

929
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,508
how will you turn him?

930
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:24,314
I think of it as a dance.

931
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:27,116
Right now I'm just trying
to select the proper music.

932
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,918
Speaking of which, there's an affair

933
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:30,386
at the house of Edward Shippen this week.

934
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,154
- Will you be attending?
- Yes, yes.

935
00:53:32,189 --> 00:53:34,290
Well, that is a dance, this is war.

936
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:37,292
- There is a difference.
- Trust me, General.

937
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:39,226
The key to victory is having the right man.

938
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,662
<i>Our man in the heart of the enemy camp.</i>

939
00:53:44,134 --> 00:53:46,300
Abe's voice: <i>York City.</i>

940
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:50,605
<i>The city feels changed.</i>

941
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,606
<i>Petty vice and deeper corruptions
have taken their toll.</i>

942
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,576
<i>That should work in my favor.</i>

943
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,983
(chatter)

944
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:01,984
Abe's voice: <i>An acquaintance from Oyster Bay</i>

945
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:05,689
<i>recommended a modest boardinghouse.</i>

946
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:08,058
<i>I figured breakfast was
as good a time as any</i>

947
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:10,227
<i>to get the lay of the land.</i>

948
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:25,341
Morning.

949
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,944
I wondered if you could hard-boil
a dozen of these for me.

950
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,448
A dozen?

951
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,015
Yeah, I got a lot of books to read.

952
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,949
These help me get through the
long afternoons in the library.

953
00:54:35,016 --> 00:54:36,617
Thank you, sir.

954
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:44,859
Abe's voice: <i>The city's
inhabitants seem tired, on edge.</i>

955
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:48,231
<i>By my estimate, a sudden attack of 5,000 men</i>

956
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:51,769
<i>could take them all and end the war.</i>

957
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:54,236
- Here you are, Mr. Woodhull.
- Thank you.

958
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,778
The last time I was here,
you couldn't take a step

959
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:04,909
without tripping over a soldier.

960
00:55:04,943 --> 00:55:08,178
Now there are so few, a man
barely feels safe on the streets.

961
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:09,881
Where are they all hiding?

962
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,820
Best to keep to your porridge, sir.

963
00:55:16,222 --> 00:55:20,125
Damn! Not again.

964
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:28,502
May I make a suggestion?

965
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,503
You could hardly make things worse.

966
00:55:30,538 --> 00:55:33,674
My father used to make me
cry over this game all the time

967
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,211
until I learned a few tricks for myself.

968
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,212
He'll take my piece.

969
00:55:38,246 --> 00:55:40,350
Sacrifice for the greater good.

970
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:45,857
(laughs)

971
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,830
King me, you unlucky bastard.

972
00:55:57,468 --> 00:56:00,101
I don't know about any soldiers,

973
00:56:00,135 --> 00:56:02,837
but those sailors, as you say,

974
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:04,105
are on a tear.

975
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:06,274
- Navy, huh?
- Mm.

976
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:08,678
Building new ships over at the west wharf.

977
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:11,716
Making it hard for a man
to get his goods to market.

978
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:14,453
Well, I'll steer clear of the west wharf.

979
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:16,590
I like to study in quiet.

980
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,260
Good luck.

981
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:22,696
Thank you. And have fun with your books.

982
00:56:32,168 --> 00:56:36,859
__

983
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:39,526
What a lovely cross-stitch.

984
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:41,260
Isn't it lovely, Rachel?

985
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:43,028
Yes, very.

986
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:45,162
I'm so glad Mary invited you to join us.

987
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:47,362
It was Major Hewlett's suggestion.

988
00:56:49,396 --> 00:56:51,866
I had... I had assumed that
Mrs. Strong was too busy

989
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,032
to be frittering away time with us.

990
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:58,671
You poor thing. You must be overwhelmed.

991
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:02,073
I can only imagine how hard it
was to abandon your husband

992
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:05,978
and be forced to serve as a barmaid
in the tavern he used to own.

993
00:57:10,114 --> 00:57:12,350
I didn't mean to sound disparaging.

994
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:14,353
Honest work is honest work.

995
00:57:14,388 --> 00:57:16,956
No offense taken.

996
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:19,358
And as for my husband,

997
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:21,892
I could hardly have gone
on living with a traitor.

998
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,766
All men are rebels at heart.

999
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,665
It takes a strong woman to steer them

1000
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,169
<i>toward a proper understanding
of their obligations.</i>

1001
00:57:31,203 --> 00:57:34,341
- But such is our burden.
- <i>(Women laugh)</i>

1002
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:38,812
I had an idea last night.

1003
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:41,450
I think that we should organize a charity.

1004
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:42,650
A charity?

1005
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:45,384
<i>To buy provisions for families of soldiers</i>

1006
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,686
who've died during battle

1007
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,688
such as poor Ensign Baker.

1008
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:50,155
What sort of provisions?

1009
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:52,659
Basic necessities... flour, salt,

1010
00:57:52,694 --> 00:57:54,894
<i>good cloth, Bibles, perhaps.</i>

1011
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,130
I think that's a wonderful idea.

1012
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,067
Still, I wonder how far our money will go

1013
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,772
<i>with everything so dear these days.</i>

1014
00:58:03,807 --> 00:58:06,177
Lydia: <i>It's a pity about the poor soldiers.</i>

1015
00:58:06,211 --> 00:58:09,547
But more the pity for us if
our own families suffer for it.

1016
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:15,553
There could be a way to lighten the burden.

1017
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:18,558
As you all know, my employer

1018
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:21,428
Mr. DeJong is tight with his guineas.

1019
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:23,633
The man makes a vice of frugality.

1020
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,202
Which is why he also buys his rum
and supplies from a privateer.

1021
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:29,338
A privateer? You mean a pirate?

1022
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:32,407
A privateer is licensed by the British

1023
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:35,209
to prey on rebel shipping,
so it's all quite legal.

1024
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:38,012
<i>We could use Mr. DeJong's contact</i>

1025
00:58:38,046 --> 00:58:39,880
and with the money we save,

1026
00:58:39,914 --> 00:58:42,349
the cost of Mary's charity
could be quite manageable.

1027
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:44,885
I don't approve of consorting with thieves

1028
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,288
no matter what they call themselves.

1029
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:50,759
Surely you approve of
helping widows and orphans.

1030
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:53,595
(Chuckles nervously)

1031
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:57,933
It's settled, then.

1032
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,905
Good day, ladies.

1033
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,908
Um, Mary,

1034
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:06,510
has there been a delivery
of a package for me?

1035
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:07,977
What type of package?

1036
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,114
I've been eagerly awaiting the delivery

1037
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:12,451
of an item from London by way of New York.

1038
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:15,254
It would be quite heavy.

1039
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,222
Not yet, but I will keep an eye out for it.

1040
00:59:17,257 --> 00:59:19,558
Thank you.

1041
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:23,662
And I am very pleased to see you

1042
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:26,963
among this august company, Mrs. Strong.

1043
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,431
Thank you, Major.

1044
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,333
I'm very pleased to be here.

1045
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:38,135
(Women giggle)

1046
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:41,039
It seems Anna has an august admirer.

1047
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,875
(laughing)

1048
00:59:54,985 --> 00:59:56,318
Hello.

1049
00:59:57,987 --> 00:59:59,755
Have you seen Major André?

1050
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,157
No, I'm sorry. I was at the market.

1051
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:03,660
I'd like to know when he'll see me.

1052
01:00:03,694 --> 01:00:06,031
I've already been waiting an hour.

1053
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:08,301
I'll go find out, sir.

1054
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,102
Setauket.

1055
01:00:10,137 --> 01:00:12,542
That's where I know you from.

1056
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,810
You were working at Strong Manor.

1057
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:19,046
Tell me, do you miss Long Island?

1058
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:21,648
No, sir.

1059
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,416
I'm happy here.

1060
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:26,020
I do.

1061
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:29,153
I can picture it in my mind even now.

1062
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:41,868
The last time we met, you stabbed a
man in the neck with this over dinner.

1063
01:00:41,902 --> 01:00:45,407
An enemy spy I was hoping to turn double.

1064
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,711
Your behavior was savage.

1065
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:51,547
It was that same savagery, apparently,
that landed you a court-martial.

1066
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,816
Thank you, sir.

1067
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,451
There's no need to remind me of that night.

1068
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,152
It's still fresh in my mind.

1069
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,222
- But...
- Yes?

1070
01:00:58,256 --> 01:01:01,927
I must confess to wondering why
you've summoned me here today.

1071
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:03,963
The Queen's Rangers lack a commander.

1072
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:06,799
The last murdering savage who
had that job went rogue on me,

1073
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,367
so I need a new one.

1074
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:10,102
<i>Someone who can bridle these men</i>

1075
01:01:10,136 --> 01:01:12,737
and ready them for a special
mission I'm planning.

1076
01:01:15,573 --> 01:01:18,776
<i>(Voices continue muffled)</i>

1077
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,124
A demotion?

1078
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,627
The Queen's Rangers are
provincial forces, aren't they?

1079
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,064
Don't touch that.

1080
01:01:43,098 --> 01:01:46,035
If I accepted that post, I'd
no longer be a royal officer.

1081
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,968
You'll retain your rank, Captain.

1082
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:50,236
But not my uniform.

1083
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,703
And at the risk of sounding mercenary,

1084
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:53,940
I imagine my pay will be cut as well.

1085
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:56,606
<i>(Voices continue muffled)</i>

1086
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,553
Would you rather go back to the commissary?

1087
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:14,489
I'm offering you one last
chance at resurrection.

1088
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:18,658
I suppose that depends
on how you look at it.

1089
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,393
It seems to me that while murdering savages

1090
01:02:21,428 --> 01:02:22,960
can be purchased on any corner,

1091
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:26,264
those that can command
other murdering savages

1092
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:27,900
are a rarer commodity.

1093
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:30,136
What do you want?

1094
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,040
Whilst we await this special mission,

1095
01:02:33,074 --> 01:02:35,709
may I base my Rangers wherever I choose?

1096
01:02:35,743 --> 01:02:37,310
You'll have a ship at your disposal,

1097
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:38,847
so as long as I can
reach out to you quickly,

1098
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:40,350
that shouldn't be a problem.

1099
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,421
Then consider me at your disposal.

1100
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:45,358
I already do. You may leave at once.

1101
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:48,229
Oh, and good luck with your new men.

1102
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:51,794
Rogers trained them to hate British
officers even more than the rebels.

1103
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:53,898
I suppose I'll have to charm them.

1104
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:58,598
Thank you, Major.

1105
01:03:11,074 --> 01:03:14,540
I'll tell your former mistress
that you're happy here.

1106
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:21,280
André: <i>A detestable man.</i>

1107
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:25,583
But sadly sometimes such
men can serve a purpose.

1108
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:29,220
<i>Abigail?</i>

1109
01:03:29,254 --> 01:03:30,488
You want something?

1110
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:33,290
Sir, I bought this at the market

1111
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:35,224
with the money you paid me.

1112
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:36,925
It's for my son.

1113
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,527
He's never had anything so fine.

1114
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,628
- <i>I was hoping...</i>
- Say no more.

1115
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,196
I'll have it sent out at once

1116
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,934
with a dispatch rider headed for New York.

1117
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:45,368
Thank you, sir.

1118
01:03:45,402 --> 01:03:47,602
I'll wrap it up right away.

1119
01:03:55,922 --> 01:03:57,823
Abe's voice: <i>October 16.</i>

1120

<i>South Ward.</i>

1134
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:57,556
<i>Two frigates, the 32-gun Alarm</i>

1135
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,725
<i>and 28-gun Sybil moored at Peck's Slip</i>

01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:28,116
<i>A dozen 24-pounders and

1142
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:29,283
<i>Canal Street.</i>

1143
01:05:29,318 --> 01:05:30,985
<i>Pits being dug every 50 yards,</i>

1144
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:32,786
<i>three or four feet deep

01:05:32,821 --> 01:05:34,320
<i>No doubt to wound men

1146
01:05:34,355 --> 01:05:37,223
<i>Troop barges moored at Old Slip.</i>

1147
01:05:37,257 --> 01:05:40,658
<i>They're secured by chains and
booms to keep off fire rafts.</i>

1148
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,142
- Hello there. Ahem.
- Oh, pardon.

1149
01:05:54,177 --> 01:05:57,945
This isn't... your room is the next one.

1150
01:06:02,186 --> 01:06:04,021
Is, uh...

1151
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:06,790
is there something wrong with
the eggs I've boiled for you?

1152
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:10,459
No, I just...

1153
01:06:10,493 --> 01:06:12,928
I like my eggs warm.

1154
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:22,305

01:06:51,066 --> 01:06:53,035
<i>(knocking)</i>

01:06:57,307 --> 01:06:59,675
<i>(knocking)</i>

1157
01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:04,214
Who is it?

1158
01:07:04,249 --> 01:07:06,651
<i>Major Hewlett.</i>

1159
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:13,021
Ah, Mrs. Strong.

1160
01:07:13,056 --> 01:07:17,024
I was afraid it would be too late,
but then I saw your light.

1161
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:19,425
How can I help you, Major?

1162
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:21,726
I have received a package

1163
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:24,797
from Major André from Philadelphia.

1164
01:07:24,831 --> 01:07:26,698
I believe it to be another gift

1165
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:29,701
from your former slave Abigail to her son.

1166
01:07:29,735 --> 01:07:32,866
Cicero is asleep now, but I'm sure
he'll be very excited to receive it.

1167
01:07:32,901 --> 01:07:35,436
I thought to bring it personally
because I have some news

1168
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:37,004
which I think you'll be pleased to hear.

1169
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,171
Yes?

1170
01:07:39,205 --> 01:07:43,311
Seeing you with Mrs. Woodhull's
coterie made me realize anew

1171
01:07:43,345 --> 01:07:46,148
how difficult this ordeal
must have been for you.

1172
01:07:46,182 --> 01:07:49,686
Forced from your home
and unable to take part

1173
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:52,523
in the ordinary life of the town,

1174
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:54,558
all by the treachery of a man

1175
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:59,397
whose name you have to drag
behind you like a sea anchor.

1176
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,197
So, I saw the judge.

1177
01:08:02,232 --> 01:08:06,839
And he sees no impediment
to you securing a divorce.

1178
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:08,540
Oh.

1179
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,375
You can argue desertion.

1180
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:13,846
I hadn't considered it yet,
but here, let me...

1181
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,479
The only caveat is that it
might take more than a year.

1182
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:20,282
And so in the meantime, I thought

1183
01:08:20,317 --> 01:08:23,749
that I might make you a proposal.

1184
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,586
A proposal?

1185
01:08:26,621 --> 01:08:29,088
I of course don't mean

1186
01:08:29,123 --> 01:08:31,953
in the formal sense of the word.

1187
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:34,788
I, um...

1188
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:38,126
thought that if perhaps you might be open

1189
01:08:38,161 --> 01:08:41,695
to establishing a friendship.

1190
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:44,066
Entirely platonic, of course.

1191
01:08:44,101 --> 01:08:45,935
"Play-tonic"?

1192
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,070
Yes, owing to the ideals of Plato

1193
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:50,475
that is attributed to his feelings

1194
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,411
with the prophetess Diotima.

1195
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:54,748
Feelings, he felt,

1196
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:57,253
unencumbered by the base Eros,

1197
01:08:57,287 --> 01:09:01,221
was a surer way to the
contemplation of the divine.

1198
01:09:01,256 --> 01:09:02,923
Major.

1199
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:08,030
Yes.

1200
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:10,333
Yes, of course.

1201
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:14,704
I didn't mean to presume.

1202
01:09:14,739 --> 01:09:16,973
<i>Uh, good night.</i>

1203
01:09:17,008 --> 01:09:19,640
Major.

1204
01:09:19,674 --> 01:09:22,111
Abigail's gift.

1205
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:24,651
Oh.

1206
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:26,686
Yes, how foolish of me.

1207
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:32,263
Good night.

1208
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,973
__

1209
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:12,704
__

1210
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:15,440
Clinton: <i>Ah, a whiff of civilization.</i>

1211
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:19,745
- Why, it almost reminds me of Paris.
- London.

1212
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:22,482
Tell me about our host in case
I'm forced to converse with him.

1213
01:10:22,516 --> 01:10:24,753
The Shippens are the cream
of Philadelphia society.

1214
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,458
This ball is their way of welcoming us.

1215
01:10:27,493 --> 01:10:30,532
So clearly there can be no
doubt about their loyalties?

1216
01:10:30,566 --> 01:10:32,235
Actually, it is a bit unclear.

1217
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,905
Judge Shippen opposed the
extension of royal authority,

1218
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,874
at least where taxation is concerned.

1219
01:10:36,908 --> 01:10:41,208
But he also opposed last year's
Pennsylvania constitution.

1220
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,612
Though perhaps because it
threatened his own authority

1221
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:44,914
as much as the Crown's.

1222
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:47,049
So is the man for us or against us?

1223
01:10:47,084 --> 01:10:50,824
Families such as the Shippens
imagine they are above us, sir.

1224
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:53,293
Well, above you, maybe.

1225
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:57,399
<i>And yet, with hair like that,
they can't help but tower.</i>

1226
01:10:57,434 --> 01:10:58,968
It's a miracle it doesn't topple.

1227
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:02,705
- Who is...
- Margaret Shippen, their youngest.

1228
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:05,577
And as for the high roll,
it's the latest fashion.

1229
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:07,345
Looks French to me.

1230
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:09,714
Oh, there's Cornwallis.

1231
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,818
I can't resist a chance to tweak Charlie

1232
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:15,623
about how Washington foxed him at Trenton.

1233
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:32,516
A pleasure, Lieutenant.

1234
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,252
Likewise, Miss Shippen.

1235
01:11:34,287 --> 01:11:38,425
The very instant I saw you did
my heart fly to your service.

1236
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:41,327
Do you quote Shakespeare to all the ladies?

1237
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:44,965
Only the ones that stir
a tempest in my heart.

1238
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,936
I think you do, for that was well-rehearsed.

1239
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,104
(Women giggli)

1240
01:11:52,737 --> 01:11:55,035
At least they don't kiss
in the continental style.

1241
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,504
It disorders one's high roll,

1242
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:58,975
and I've already put poor
Freddy through enough today.

1243
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:01,812
Have a care, Peggy. You'll
scare off all the eligible men.

1244
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:05,552
- Freddy: She's right.
- That's because to Becky all men are eligible.

1245
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,821
And I expect when we're her
age, we'll feel the same.

1246
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:09,723
- Thank you, Becky.
- You're welcome, Becky.

1247
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:11,192
By the time I'm Miss Redman's age,

1248
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,463
I expect to be on my second husband.

1249
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:15,231
Ever the romantic.

1250
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:18,168
But first you may want to find number one.

1251
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:21,874
And who would you pick, Freddy,
from this pool of too eager candidates?

1252
01:12:21,908 --> 01:12:24,745
I guess that depends on
what one looks for in a man.

1253
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,783
If I were Peggy,

1254
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:30,154
I would choose someone

1255
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:32,924
tall and dashing.

1256
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:36,331
Maybe someone with an elegant little braid.

1257
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:38,299
Then again, I'm sure our Peggy is immune

1258
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:41,438
to such superficial inducements.

1259
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:49,846
Why, Peggy, he didn't even smile at you.

1260
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,885
A man immune to the
charms of Margaret Shippen.

1261
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,486
What has the world come to?

1262
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:57,820
I suspect he's more Freddy's type after all.

1263
01:12:57,854 --> 01:12:59,589
One can dream.

1264
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:02,530
It's your deal, Becky.

1265
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:04,935
Age before beauty.

1266
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:06,370
Youth before wisdom.

1267
01:13:06,404 --> 01:13:08,640
I'll deal.

1268
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,484
Now what is that infernal man doing?

1269
01:13:17,587 --> 01:13:19,523
(Playing up-tempo music)

1270
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:21,622
Killing the ambiance, apparently.

1271
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:28,427
Not so, apparently.

1272
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,672
Major John André at your service, ladies.

1273
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:50,939
What service are you offering, Major?

1274
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:52,472
Why, a dance, of course.

1275
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:56,909
May I have the pleasure?

1276
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:09,123
May I have the pleasure, Miss Franks?

1277
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:21,936
General, I heard a rumor

1278
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,371
that you can lead a minuet
as expertly as a charge.

1279
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:26,173
- Is it true?
- Perhaps.

1280
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:28,341
But would your father approve, Miss Shippen?

1281
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,175
Do you require his approval?

1282
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,310
I thought you were the
highest authority in this room

1283
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:34,178
if not this city.

1284
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,018
(Music continues)

1285
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,549
- <i>(music ends)</i>
- (Applause)

1286
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:21,327
<i>(music resumes)</i>

1287
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,670
Major André.

1288
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:32,605
Miss Shippen.

1289
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:34,709
So you know my name after all.

1290
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,679
I know your family quite well.

1291
01:15:36,714 --> 01:15:38,616
Or of them anyway.

1292
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:40,886
And I know nothing of you.

1293
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,156
Except perhaps that you
asked my friend to dance

1294
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,725
in an attempt to induce jealousy.

1295
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,962
Do you really think women
are so easily manipulated?

1296
01:15:48,997 --> 01:15:50,466
We're dancing, aren't we?

1297
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,301
There's a fine line between
confidence and arrogance, Major.

1298
01:15:54,335 --> 01:15:56,435
I'm sure you'll tell me if I cross it.

1299
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,572
I'm reserving judgment.

1300
01:15:59,606 --> 01:16:04,138
Still, why not aim directly
at what you're after?

1301
01:16:04,172 --> 01:16:07,310
When I saw you turn away other men,
I knew a stratagem was called for.

1302
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:10,078
If not to pique your jealousy,
then at least your curiosity.

1303
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:12,113
You like to play games, don't you?

1304
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:13,215
As do you.

1305
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:14,719
This may be a game to a man,

1306
01:16:14,753 --> 01:16:16,719
but to a woman, the stakes are very real.

1307
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,591
Even to a very lovely young woman?

1308
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,692
A woman's allure rests on her saying no.

1309
01:16:21,726 --> 01:16:24,962
But no matter how lovely,
she can only say no for so long

1310
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:28,299
or she ends up like my poor
Becky, an old maid at 26.

1311
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,100
<i>(Music ends)</i>

1312
01:16:30,135 --> 01:16:31,702
You may have won this dance, Major,

1313
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:34,237
but who's to say there'll be another?

1314
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:38,139
Is this the fate of every
man to fall under your spell?

1315
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:40,672
One whirl around the dance
floor and then oblivion?

1316
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:43,042
How many others do you
think there have been?

1317
01:16:43,076 --> 01:16:45,445
I won't hazard a guess,
but I'm sure you entertained

1318
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:47,614
some rebel officers before we came to town.

1319
01:16:47,648 --> 01:16:50,517
More tolerated than entertained.

1320
01:16:52,153 --> 01:16:55,622
What about that scamp who gave
us so much trouble at Saratoga?

1321
01:16:55,656 --> 01:16:58,025
Benedict Arnold.

1322
01:16:58,059 --> 01:17:00,260
I hear he once stayed at your house.

1323
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:02,462
When I was 14.

1324
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,298
If my eyes are any judge,

1325
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:06,834
I imagine he must still think of you.

1326
01:17:06,868 --> 01:17:09,038
Do you?

1327
01:17:10,241 --> 01:17:12,840
I wonder, what games are we playing now?

1328
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:16,809
<i>(Music resumes)</i>

1329
01:17:16,844 --> 01:17:18,912
Boccherini's minuet.

1330
01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:20,847
Dare I request another dance?

1331
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:25,785
Just one more, perhaps.

1332
01:17:32,406 --> 01:17:34,608
No breakfast? You paid for it.

1333
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:37,611
Uh, no. I can't, I'm afraid. Long trip back.

1334
01:17:37,645 --> 01:17:39,079
Best be on my way.

1335
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:41,746
How about some bread for the road?

1336
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,845
Fine.

1337
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:47,684
Let's see.

1338
01:17:47,718 --> 01:17:49,985
Here you go.

1339
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:51,855
Law studies off to a good start?

1340
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:53,591
I hope so.

1341
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,093
It's not really for me to judge.

1342
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:56,929
<i>For a man cocooned with his books,</i>

1343
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,464
you managed quite a sunburn.

1344
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:03,766
Old habits, I suppose.

1345
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:06,336
I was a farmer before I took up the law.

1346
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:08,406
I thought why waste the
whole of a lovely day indoors

1347
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,508
when I could be out committing
my case to memory?

1348
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:12,377
Thank you.

1349
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:13,912
I had a lovely stay.

1350
01:18:13,947 --> 01:18:17,347
And I expect I'll be back soon.

1351
01:18:20,454 --> 01:18:23,058
- (Chatter)
- <i>(Seagulls screeching)</i>

1352
01:18:31,328 --> 01:18:33,194
You look like the cat that ate the cream.

1353
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:34,761
I think the law agrees with me.

1354
01:18:34,796 --> 01:18:37,497
I'm glad someone enjoyed himself.

1355
01:18:37,532 --> 01:18:40,534
Well, you keep dreaming of
holy ground, Mr. Eastin.

1356
01:18:40,568 --> 01:18:42,302
Someday you'll get your just reward.

1357
01:18:42,336 --> 01:18:45,706
Hold on there. Need to see those bags first.

1358
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:47,444
Right.

1359
01:18:48,714 --> 01:18:50,347
There you go.

1360
01:18:57,621 --> 01:18:59,553
What's this?

1361
01:18:59,588 --> 01:19:02,089
- Lunch.
- Let's see it.

1362
01:19:02,992 --> 01:19:04,726
If you must.

1363
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,594
Looks like someone's robbed the henhouse.

1364
01:19:10,629 --> 01:19:12,330
Can you spare a couple?

1365
01:19:14,465 --> 01:19:16,033
Help yourself.

1366
01:19:16,068 --> 01:19:18,905
Just avoid the brown ones,
though. They're a little sour.

1367
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:22,643
What brown ones? All
right, then. Off you go.

1368
01:19:25,514 --> 01:19:28,515
- Hyah. Hyah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1369
01:19:29,652 --> 01:19:31,220
I think I left something in my room.

1370
01:19:31,254 --> 01:19:34,727
I don't want to risk getting
caught after dark. Hey!

1371
01:19:44,641 --> 01:19:46,876
(Panting)

1372
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,716
Back already?

1373
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,184
Yeah.

1374
01:19:53,218 --> 01:19:55,221
I think I left something in my room.

1375
01:19:55,255 --> 01:19:58,295
It's already been rented out.

1376
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:02,932
- Oh.
- You don't look well, sir.

1377
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:24,354
Here you go. I still owe you breakfast.

1378
01:20:24,388 --> 01:20:26,123
I didn't order this.

1379
01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:29,792
I know, but you didn't stick to
your porridge either, did you?

1380
01:20:43,002 --> 01:20:45,669
I wondered if you could hard-boil
a dozen of these for me.

1381
01:20:47,036 --> 01:20:49,171
Owner: <i>How about some bread for the road?</i>

1382
01:20:49,205 --> 01:20:51,702
Abe: <i>Fine.</i>

1383
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,941
<i>(heart beating)</i>

1384
01:21:11,045 --> 01:21:12,478
It was hard-boiled.

1385
01:21:12,512 --> 01:21:15,980
That one had a bitter taste.
I couldn't serve it.

1386
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:17,848
Then why did you take it in the first place?

1387
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:20,220
Would you rather I had
served it to that gentleman?

1388
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:34,604
I'm sorry, I... I never got your name.

1389
01:21:34,638 --> 01:21:39,039
The name's Townsend. Robert Townsend.

1390
01:21:39,074 --> 01:21:42,345
And I don't care to see you here again.

1391
01:22:01,526 --> 01:22:03,161
Hey, boy.

1392
01:22:04,596 --> 01:22:06,398
Boy.

1393
01:22:06,433 --> 01:22:08,335
My name ain't boy.

1394
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,470
You calling me a liar, boy?

1395
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:15,443
Oh, yeah, it's Aak... Aak-in-balls, right?

1396
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:17,945
Akinbode.

1397
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,946
Major Rogers' pet monkey.

1398
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,246
You and that Indian.

1399
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,184
What was his damn name?

1400
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:24,622
- Awass-hole.
- Awass-hole.

1401
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:27,192
Aak-in-balls and Awass-hole, that's right.

1402
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:29,395
Only the Indian left when Rogers did.

1403
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:32,134
But you're still here.
Why are you here, boy?

1404
01:22:32,168 --> 01:22:35,135
I earned my place just like the rest of you.

1405
01:22:35,169 --> 01:22:37,669
Right.

1406
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:39,804
You're good with sticks.

1407
01:22:40,772 --> 01:22:42,572
Take it.

1408
01:22:42,606 --> 01:22:44,907
<i>Go on.</i>

1409
01:22:49,243 --> 01:22:52,649
See if I don't add your
scalp to my friends here.

1410
01:22:54,884 --> 01:22:57,017
- Man:<i> All right, Cager.</i>
- <i>(Chatter)</i>

1411
01:23:01,558 --> 01:23:03,359
Whoa.

1412
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:06,563
Well, what have we here?

1413
01:23:06,597 --> 01:23:08,898
If you're looking for Philadelphia,

1414
01:23:08,933 --> 01:23:10,667
head to the river and make a right.

1415
01:23:10,701 --> 01:23:12,636
- <i>(Men laugh)</i>
- Thank you.

1416
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:14,638
But I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

1417
01:23:14,672 --> 01:23:17,843
My name is Captain John Graves Simcoe

1418
01:23:17,877 --> 01:23:22,447
and I'm your new commander by
orders of Major John André.

1419
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,452
That's a nice hat you
got there, your lordship.

1420
01:23:27,487 --> 01:23:29,955
<i>But it might get a little dirty where we go.</i>

1421
01:23:29,989 --> 01:23:31,688
- (men laugh)
- Trust me,

1422
01:23:31,722 --> 01:23:34,091
I've no more desire to
lead a provincial force

1423
01:23:34,126 --> 01:23:36,293
than you have to serve
under a royal officer.

1424
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:41,464
These are my orders and
yours are to obey mine.

1425
01:23:41,498 --> 01:23:44,132
If you do, I promise to mold you

1426
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,268
into the finest light infantry in the land.

1427
01:23:47,302 --> 01:23:49,537
Now...

1428
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:51,839
let's line up and fall in.

1429
01:24:00,383 --> 01:24:03,053
I think what they're saying, Captain,

1430
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:05,487
<i>by not saying sod,</i>

1431
01:24:05,522 --> 01:24:08,291
is why should we obey a fop

1432
01:24:08,326 --> 01:24:10,060
in silly togs?

1433
01:24:10,094 --> 01:24:11,760
I take it, then, that you already know

1434
01:24:11,794 --> 01:24:13,495
all there is to know about fighting.

1435
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:16,000
More than you, dandelion.

1436
01:24:29,615 --> 01:24:32,552
Then kill me, if you can.

1437
01:24:35,655 --> 01:24:38,225
You worry about the consequences, I see.

1438
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:40,460
But who would ever know
all the way out here?

1439
01:24:40,494 --> 01:24:43,561
You could kill me and then stuff
my body in some animal's burrow

1440
01:24:43,596 --> 01:24:45,465
<i>and say you never saw me.</i>

1441
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:49,001
That is, of course, if you can kill me.

1442
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,521
(Grunts)

1443
01:25:04,555 --> 01:25:07,627
- (cracks)
- (Screams)

1444
01:25:07,662 --> 01:25:09,896
(grunts)

1445
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:12,568
- (groans)
- Thank you.

1446
01:25:13,836 --> 01:25:15,236
(Screams)

1447
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,736
One more for your collection.

1448
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:27,147
Now then, where were we?

1449
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,015
No!

1450
01:25:32,484 --> 01:25:34,552
(Groaning)

1451
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:37,623
My hope, of course,

1452
01:25:37,657 --> 01:25:41,227
is that our lessons won'.

1453
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:42,261
<i>(Pistol cocks)</i>

1454
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:44,664
(gunshot)

1455
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:58,375
Now, let's try this again.

1456
01:26:05,048 --> 01:26:06,882
Fall in.

1457
01:26:32,617 --> 01:26:38,407
