<b><i>DEATH OF A SHADOW</i></b>

2
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,530

3
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
<i>Jan Ternauw</i>

4
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,566
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,468
<i>Jan Ternauw
July 6th, 1983, Colombier Street</i>

6
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,988
<i>Beaten to death
by Boran Kassovic.</i>

7
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:29,526
<i>Nathan Rijckx
November 10th, 1917, Parc de l'Abbaye</i>

8
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:31,876
<i>Shot dead by
Franz Baumer & Joachim Dünker</i>

9
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,158
Mr. Rijckx?

10
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:50,358
Did you bring me Jan Ternauw?

11
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,050
Excellent, Mr. Rijckx!

12
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:54,088
The work of a beginner,
this Kassovic.

13
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,950
However, a strong composition,
concrete.

14
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:00,383
An excellent combination
of fear and suffering,

15
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,522
of passion and form.
So energetic!

16
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,982
I'll be very sorry to see you
leave my service, Mr. Rijckx.

17
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:15,609
- But,... you could also stay.
- No.

18
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,171
Why so attached to life,
Mr. Rijckx?

19
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:26,130
So little happiness,
so much pain...

20
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:30,985
I could... show you
the true beauty of death.

21
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,043
Two more, Mr. Rijckx.

22
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,925
Two more...

23
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:17,899
<i>Accident</i>

24
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:22,130
<i>Explosion

<i>Murder</i>

26

<i>Old age</i>

27
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,782
<i>Thomas Belcourt, November 30th, 1918

28
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,708

31
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,150
Sarah...

32
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:34,324
Sarah?

33
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:36,713
<i>Daniel Hainaut</i>

34
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,683
Daniel?

35
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,841
Death by old age?

36
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,333
Don't you know that these shadows
are almost never interesting.

37
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,916
It's a worthless composition.

38
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,916
I know that not all deaths
are masterpieces, but nevertheless...

39
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,416
I hope that your final project
will be more interesting.

40
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,766
The spontaneous aesthetics
of an accident, for example...

41
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,204
For example...

42
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,255
A train, a plane or a car...

43
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,163
An explosion...

44
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,505
Or a drowning...

45
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,716
We haven't had a drowning
in a long time.

46
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,319
Or a murder.

47
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:18,140
Murder is always expressive.

48
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,723
There we have it,... murder.

49
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,890

59
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,960
I'll see you soon, Sarah.

60
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,358
Attention!

61
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,066
Line up!

62
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,908
Load!

63
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:22,652
Aim!

64
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:25,143
Fire!

65
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:04,634
My offer still stands,
Mr. Rijckx.

66
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,942
You can stay.

67
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,252
No.

68
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,546
You have lived 10,000 days.
You have given me 10,000 lives.

69
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,232
Your death is erased.

70
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,389
Mr. Rijckx...

71
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:40,588
The door to life will remain open
for exactly 1 hour.

72
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:45,505
You can go wherever
and whenever you want.

73
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,270
Choose wisely... because,
when the time has passed,

74
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,135
this door will be
closed to you forever.

75
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:25,627
I knew you'd come back.

76
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,007
No one wanted to believe me,
but I knew it.

77
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,558
Daniel?

78
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,291
Daniel?

79
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:41,275
Daniel?

80
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,450
Daniel?

81
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,567
- Sarah!
- Daniel?

82
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,766
My apologies, sir.

83
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:02,463
Ms. Winters is a bit confused.

84
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,108
Her Daniel... She was never able
to accept the awful truth.

85
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,588
And now, she thinks that
every soldier in uniform...

86
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,700
But dead soldiers do not return.

87
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,640
Right?

88
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:59,835
One life for another,
Mr. Rijckx.

89
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,546
When a shadow disappears,

90
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,893
another one has to stay.

91
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,813
The choice is yours.

92
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,450
She is waiting...
