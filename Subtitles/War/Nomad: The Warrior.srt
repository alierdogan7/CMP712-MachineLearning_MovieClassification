1
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,255
<i>Man's voice:
For hundreds of years,</i>

2
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,842
<i>a great Asian region
bordered by Russia and China</i>

3
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,095
<i>has been home
to my people, the Kazakhs,</i>

4
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>nomadic tribesmen roaming
from one pasture to another.</i>

5
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,438
<i>Since the time
of our legendary ancestor</i>

6
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:50,193
<i>Genghis Kahn, hordes of foreign invaders
have tried to conquer this land</i>

7
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,030
<i>and put an end
to our peaceful way of life.</i>

8
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,128
<i>Of all those who threaten
the lives of my people,</i>

9
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>none were more brutal, more relentless</i>

10
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,259
<i>than the fierce
Jungar tribesmen from Mongolia.</i>

11
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,346
( shouting )

12
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,354
( horses whinnying )

13
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,387
( all speaking at once )

14
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,976
<i>Man's voice: The Jungars
brought war and destruction.</i>

15
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,147
<i>Our tribal leaders could not unite
against this deadly enemy.</i>

16
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:13,610
<i>So many fled from the horrors of war
that it became known as</i>

17
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,113
<i>the "Flight with Bloody Feet."</i>

18
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,281
<i>Many of us remain,</i>

19
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>hoping to see the fulfillment
of the prophecy that one day</i>

20
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,874
<i>a warrior descendent of Genghis Kahn
would rise up and unite all Kazakhs</i>

21
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,669
<i>in a revolt against our enemies.</i>

22
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,306
<i>/, Oraz,</i>

23
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,060
<i>have always believed
I would see this come to pass,</i>

24
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:51,481
<i>and I have searched far and wide
for the promised child.</i>

25
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,424
Surround him.

26
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,187
Man: Are you the one
they call Oraz the wise?

27
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,980
Yes, I am Oraz.

28
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:36,693
The Great Khan of all Jungars, Galdan
Ceren, commands us to bring you to him.

29
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,364
You may tell your Great Khan
that I am not a Jungar,

30
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,492
and I do not have to obey his command.

31
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,119
Such words can cause a man's death.

32
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,289
However, my orders
are to bring you in alive.

33
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,000
- Take him.
- ( shouting )

34
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,989
Man: You are wise, Oraz.

35
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:27,536
You know that if we return without you,
we could lose our heads.

36
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,580
That would be unfortunate.

37
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,375
I would not wish
your children to curse me.

38
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,707
I have found him, Great Kahn.

39
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,301
So you are Oraz.

40
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,762
I have heard much about you.

41
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,267
It is said that you understand
the languages of all animals.

42
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,604
- Is this true?
- That is only given to God.

43
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,232
Although you won't deny
that you understand horses.

44
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,486
People say that as well.

45
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,365
Perhaps then you will
choose a horse for me,

46
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
the finest of the herd.

47
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,872
(whinnying )

48
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,759
Oraz: The chestnut stallion
with the white streak,

49
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:51,638
that is the best horse,

50
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,308
a horse fit for a Great Khan
who makes the earth tremble.

51
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,775
Do you know what awaits you
if you are wrong, wise man?

52
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,747
- На!
- (whinnies )

53
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,633
Hey, Kazakh.

54
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,010
By God, you're right.

55
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,221
The horse you chose
is fit for a great ruler.

56
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:19,225
You are right, Kazakh. You're gifted.

57
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,896
And for this,

58
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,691
I will make you the master of my stables

59
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,986
and pay you your weight in gold.

60
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,285
Oraz: Gold cannot replace freedom,
nor does it bring happiness.

61
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,666
Beware of your words, Oraz.
Your path may be a perilous one.

62
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,047
My path has already been
determined by the stars,

63
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,341
and I must follow it.

64
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,348
You speak with such
certainty about the future.

65
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,906
How brightly will my star keep burning?

66
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,408
You know yourself even stars fall

67
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,454
from the skies,
and new stars are born.

68
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,337
Wise one, this new star-

69
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,132
I must know, tell me his name.

70
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,136
I will know that when I find him.

71
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>Oraz: Whatever perils
awaited me in my path,</i>

72
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,077
<i>/ never lost hope.</i>

73
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,956
<i>One day I asked the almighty,</i>

74
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,669
"О <i>Creator,
when will You send my people</i>

75
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,131
<i>the fearless warrior
who will unite all of our tribes</i>

76
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,426
<i>and drive this foe from our land?"</i>

77
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
( bird squawks )

78
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,222
( baby crying )

79
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:25,685
<i>At that moment, I heard a child cry</i>

80
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:30,189
<i>and suddenly, I knew
that the savior of my people</i>

81
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,442
<i>had just been born.</i>

82
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,201
( singing lullaby)

83
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,584
Danger! Danger,

84
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,378
Great Kahn!

85
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,056
Oh, great Galdan,

86
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,810
I've had a terrible vision
of a child born to a Kazakh sultan

87
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,273
who will one day cross your path
and end your golden reign.

88
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:17,278
You must hunt down this wolf cub
and kill him at once.

89
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,826
So the Kazakh was right.

90
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,396
Sharish, find this Kazakh child

91
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,065
- and kill it.
- Yes, my lord.

92
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
- На!
- (whinnies )

93
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,070
<i>- As-salaam-alaikum.
- Alaikum-salaam.</i>

94
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,042
The child of the prophecy.

95
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,712
(coos )

96
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,675
Are you looking for someone, Oraz?

97
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,511
I have already found him.
Prepare for a Jungar attack.

98
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
Jungars!

99
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,650
( shouting )

100
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,409
Jungars! Protect the carriage.

101
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,521
(grunts )

102
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,526
(grunts )

103
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,786
Give me the child. Hurry.

104
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,219
(woman screams )

105
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,511
Hey, Kazakhs!

106
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:20,396
Leave him! I will kill him myself.

107
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,400
(cheering )

108
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,076
Where is the child?

109
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,495
There is no child here.

110
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,622
(grunts )

111
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,806
<i>As-salaam-alaikum, </i>Sultan.

112
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,808
Ah.

113
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,854
I need to talk to you.

114
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,939
Talk.

115
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,405
Sultan: I'll listen to you.

116
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,577
Jungars attacked the caravan
that's bringing your wife here.

117
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,413
I know.

118
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:29,210
They've all been killed,

119
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,295
my wife and my son.

120
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,008
Your son lives.

121
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,220
I was able to save the boy.

122
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,305
( baby crying )

123
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,530
My boy.

124
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,874
How will I repay you, Oraz?

125
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,335
I'm used to traveling light, Sultan.

126
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,216
I cannot let you go

127
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,094
without some reward.

128
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,432
Ask me, what do you wish?

129
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,395
Give me your son.

130
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,946
How can your tongue
speak such words, Oraz?

131
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,535
I haven't let the Jungar know
that your son is alive.

132
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:53,919
There is no safer place
in the world for him than with me,

133
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,548
here in my palace.

134
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:06,098
Somebody told the Jungar
about the caravan.

135
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,309
They were looking for him.

136
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:30,080
You ask for that
which is most precious to me.

137
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:36,962
Go and raise him a good warrior.

138
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,146
Remember, keep your back straight.

139
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,733
Keep your heels down.

140
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,486
Feel the rhythm of the horse.

141
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,822
Feel his spirit.

142
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,201
The horse is a Kazakh's best friend.

143
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,371
He is your wings.

144
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,623
You must learn to take good care of him.

145
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,217
<i>Oraz: I gathered them
from all parts of the steppe.</i>

146
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,846
<i>/ picked only the best,
each from a different tribe.</i>

147
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,600
<i>They all worked hard
to become true warriors,</i>

148
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,854
<i>but two boys outshined all the others.</i>

149
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,857
<i>Mansur and his best friend Erali.</i>

150
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,443
<i>/ was the only one who knew</i>

151
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,447
<i>that one of them
was a son of Sultan Wall.</i>

152
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,998
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

153
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:59,044
- How many eyes does a nomad have?
- Two.

154
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,505
Four.

155
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,592
Two in front and two behind.

156
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,098
<i>All: As-salaam.</i>

157
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:15,436
Tell me your names and tribes.

158
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,689
- Barak, Agai tribe.
- Zar, Ermek tribe.

159
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,775
- Azamat, Tursyn.
- Kairat, Kuntu tribe.

160
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,570
- Mansur, I'm a Kazakh.
- Bolat, Ermek tribe.

161
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,031
- Ere, Uzbek.
- I'm Erali, a Kazakh.

162
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,784
- Eren, Alighe tribe.
- You said you were a Kazakh.

163
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,328
Don't you know the name of your tribe?

164
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,622
Mansur and I say Kazakh.

165
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,854
These boys are the hope of our nation.

166
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,110
You have trained good students.

167
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,662
Well done. Let's move on
to our next lesson.

168
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,997
(yelling )

169
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,144
You are growing older

170
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,481
and older, my friend.

171
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,485
I ask you, О Great One,

172
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,488
in the memory of our deceased ancestors,

173
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,743
that our land be free
of our enemies and be reborn.

174
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,290
Our ancestors roamed
across this great steppe.

175
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:07,131
Once, long ago, the nomads

176
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,635
led by the great Attila
defeated Rome,

177
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,264
the mightiest of empires in the West.

178
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:20,144
In the East, they took China.

179
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:24,106
But, most of all, they loved their land,

180
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,234
and they always came back.

181
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,195
And the Kazakh roamed
from south to north,

182
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,450
after the spring, together
with their herds and flocks.

183
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,660
( bleating )

184
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,672
<i>Oraz: No one has yet written
the true history of our people.</i>

185
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:53,135
<i>Only the elders tell of our warriors
and their great victories.</i>

186
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:59,558
I want you to know
which people you belong to

187
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,938
and to swear loyalty to each other.

188
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:35,803
Our colt was born
on the night of the new moon.

189
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,888
Mansur: He's a good horse, Gahar.

190
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,015
What's his name?

191
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,352
-1 call him Moonchild.
- That's a good name.

192
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,982
Why are you looking at me?

193
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,737
You're the one who's looking.

194
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,491
No, I'm not. It's you.

195
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,794
Hey, Kazakh, come out and fight.

196
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,671
Or are you a coward?

197
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,226
Mansur, don't you recognize us?

198
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:29,231
- Erali, is that you?
- Scared you, didn't we?

199
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,484
I'm not scared of anything. Let's go!

200
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,618
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

201
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,748
Straight...

202
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,017
<i>Oraz:</i>
<i>After 10 years of relative peace,</i>

203
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,229
<i>the mighty Jungar army
invaded our land once again.</i>

204
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,691
<i>Meanwhile, my boys had grown up.</i>

205
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,121
Honored Oraz, Sultan Wali requests

206
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,167
that you accompany him
to Abulkhair's camp.

207
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,630
That's enough.

208
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,593
I'm gonna beat you.

209
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,094
Perhaps.

210
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,866
Man: Gather, everyone.

211
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,120
О Almighty, let the horses be strong.

212
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,915
Let the land be prosperous.

213
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,125
Let my people's spirit rise.

214
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,963
May our enemies be overcome.

215
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,756
Let the game begin.

216
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,092
- Amen.
- All: Amen.

217
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,224
(cheering )

218
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,826
Yes!

219
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,998
If we do not reach an agreement soon,
our homeland will disappear.

220
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,875
That is why I've called
the tribes together.

221
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:59,423
Tell us what you are suggesting,
honored Abulkhair.

222
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,969
One of us should be
declared as the leader,

223
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,595
and an alliance must be formed.

224
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,890
I suggest we unite with the
Russians to the west.

225
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,101
I submit to no one.

226
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,645
Abulkhair, I'm certain
if we form an alliance,

227
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,731
we will lose our freedom.

228
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,693
The Kazakhs have
always been a free people,

229
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,946
subject to no law
but God's and our own.

230
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,282
If we are to die, let us die free.

231
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,495
Honored Barak,
no one doubts your courage,

232
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:35,292
but we must join together
or be destroyed by the Jungar armies,

233
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,919
- as the prophecy decrees.
- It's nonsense!

234
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,256
- It's an insult.
- Wait, listen to Abulkhair.

235
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,733
Abulkhair: Now what?

236
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,207
( girls singing folk song )

237
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,772
( heart beating )

238
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,504
Mansur, are you asleep?

239
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,967
- No.
-1 need to talk to you.

240
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,261
My heart is bursting.

241
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,430
I have not been able to sleep all night.

242
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,978
Something's happened to me,
something I have never felt before.

243
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,480
What? What is it?

244
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:05,317
I feel- I feel dizzy

245
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,652
as if I am high above
the ground looking down.

246
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:13,575
And your knees tremble,
and the stars are falling,

247
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,536
and you walked along the bank
of the river and stood in the rain

248
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,289
- and wanted to shout out loud.
-Yes.

249
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,503
I now realize the kind of woman
the mother of my children should be.

250
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,173
In other words, you are in love.

251
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,302
Yes.

252
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,931
It happened on the swing.

253
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,516
She was next to me.

254
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,228
Her eyes and her voice.

255
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,105
Why did I not notice it before?

256
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:05,562
<i>- As-salaam-alaikum.
- Alaikum-salaam.</i>

257
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,569
I see sadness in your eyes, my son.

258
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,616
You should look into my eyes.

259
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,244
You will see an even greater sadness.

260
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,915
Our hopes for uniting
the Kazakh peoples...

261
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,129
have collapsed.

262
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,467
You and Erali are like my two hands.

263
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,679
And now much is expected of you.

264
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,110
Oh, misery!

265
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,488
I bring terrible news.

266
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,366
Darkness falls over the land,

267
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:03,453
a curse on the reign
of Galdan, the Great Kahn.

268
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,885
( chanting )

269
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,517
I bring news, my lord, terrible news.

270
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,896
Great Galdan,
О ruler of the steppes,

271
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,609
my master and protector, your wisdom
is boundless, and your reign is just

272
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,613
and truly magnificent, but the child,

273
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,326
the one from the prophecy,
the Kazakh, has not been destroyed.

274
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,871
He lives. Woe to us all.

275
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,749
He will bring ruin to the Jungars.

276
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,753
Your mighty star will be extinguished,
unless- you must find this Kazakh

277
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,964
and put an end to his life.

278
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,930
Now this Kazakh will die.

279
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,868
Но!

280
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,027
I haven't seen Moonchild in ages.

281
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,783
- He's grown.
- Yes, we have all grown up.

282
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,660
Here.

283
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:13,500
You dropped it from the swing.

284
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,919
You can keep it if you want.

285
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,632
I can't.

286
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,016
Why?

287
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,978
Because my friend loves you.

288
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,897
I know.

289
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,358
He is like a brother to me.

290
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,611
Me too, but I'm not your sister.

291
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,576
You have the scent of the moon.

292
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,290
Does the moon have a scent?

293
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,632
Black flag-
something happened.

294
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,433
Gahar: Protect him, Almighty.

295
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,199
<i>Oraz: The Jungar army
was approaching Turkistan,</i>

296
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:33,746
<i>laying waste to our land,
killing the men,</i>

297
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,207
<i>enslaving the women.</i>

298
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,210
<i>It would not be long
before they destroyed</i>

299
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,337
<i>the walls of Turkistan.</i>

300
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,926
We cannot leave Turkistan to the enemy.

301
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,637
If we survive, we can rebuild the city.

302
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,016
Now we must think about saving lives.

303
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,979
And who would lead us into battle?
Who could unite the tribes?

304
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,983
You have a son, Sultan.
His time has come.

305
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,068
Where is he, Oraz?

306
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,073
When will I see him?

307
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,496
How will I recognize him?

308
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,584
You wanted your son
to grow up to be a warrior.

309
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,295
Warriors are recognized in battle.

310
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,308
I will come back.

311
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,103
You go with them. We will find you.

312
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,169
Mansur: Moonchild,
take good care of her.

313
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,925
Look after your sister.

314
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,890
Did you talk to her?

315
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,268
No, I did not.

316
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,398
Did you?

317
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,946
We will let fate decide.

318
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,851
Our earth oil burns well.

319
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,355
The children and the others
are leaving the city.

320
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:07,024
Only those who
carry weapons will remain.

321
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,156
There are ancient
hidden tunnels under the city.

322
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,159
Meant for escape?

323
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,495
We can all vanish without a trace.

324
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,793
Do the Jungars know about it?

325
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:30,256
Unfortunately, often they know more
than we need them to know.

326
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,341
- Here, give her to me.
- Thank you.

327
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,595
Stay with your brother.

328
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,307
Zenep, Zenep, I'm going back.

329
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,475
Why?

330
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,769
Whatever happens,
I want to be with them.

331
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,646
What about us?

332
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,273
You're safe now. The gorge is there.

333
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,860
Gahar, Gahar!

334
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,780
Kasim, Kasim!

335
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,866
Stop her. She's leaving us.

336
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,834
- Gahar: Why are you following me?
- Man: Mansur ordered me to.

337
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,127
Gahar: Well, I order you
to stay at the porch.

338
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,965
-1 will not let you go alone.
- Please, Kasim.

339
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:02,223
- (whinnies )
- (screaming )

340
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,290
(laughing )

341
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,379
Sharish: Where are you going and why?

342
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,049
-1 will not tell you.
- Of course you will.

343
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,927
I will sooner die.

344
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,055
(screaming )

345
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,311
- He's still a child.
- Who is he to you?

346
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,187
He's my brother.

347
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,648
Do you want to save his life?

348
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,489
If you marry me, I will let him live,

349
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:03,659
and you will bear me a real warrior.

350
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,203
Your brother will stay with me.

351
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:10,499
If you harm yourself in any way,
he will be tortured to death

352
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,377
cursing your name.

353
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,763
Take her to our camp.

354
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:37,652
Woman: To be the wife
of a great warrior like Sharish

355
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,447
is an honor that very few
women can boast of.

356
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,909
На!

357
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,120
It's good to cry.

358
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:53,334
A woman's tears wash away
her sadness, like a long rain.

359
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,173
Aww... (laughing )

360
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,936
Hurry and prepare her.

361
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,856
She must be ready when my son
returns from his victory.

362
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,202
Man: We cannot take
this city with swords alone.

363
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,454
We must ask Galdan
for stronger weapons.

364
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:35,251
No. I will take the town myself.

365
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,811
The Kazakhs will never surrender.

366
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,314
I suggest you make another proposal.

367
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,857
I propose a fight:

368
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,817
One against one.

369
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,944
You win, we leave.

370
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,072
We win, you surrender.

371
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,159
There will be a duel
between two warriors.

372
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,496
If the Kazakh wins, they leave.

373
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,498
If the Jungar wins,

374
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:19,378
we will surrender without a fight.

375
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,467
I think we should accept it.

376
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,969
Did they give the name of their warrior?

377
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,221
- It's Sharish.
- Sharish!

378
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,182
( murmuring )

379
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,061
May I speak, Teacher?

380
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,404
You taught us to fight any opponent.

381
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:50,659
- And today we are all ready.
- Soldiers: We are ready!

382
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,415
You'll be satisfied with me, Teacher.

383
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,876
Bless me.

384
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,712
I believe you, Erali.

385
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,550
But Mansur will fight Sharish.

386
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,302
( horse whinnying )

387
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,570
It was Sharish that killed your mother.

388
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:43,587
Man: О Almighty,
help our warrior prevail over his enemy.

389
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:49,135
Let the spirit of his grandfather Ablai
help him defend his people.

390
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,804
- Amen.
- All: Amen.

391
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,808
Did you pray, Kazakh?

392
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,727
For you are about to die.

393
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,856
Am I? You tried this 20 years ago.

394
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,026
- ( warriors chanting )
-Sharish: Ha! Ha!

395
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:11,198
(warriors chanting )

396
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,578
( drums thundering )

397
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,931
(yells )

398
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,186
( shouts )

399
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,359
(grunts )

400
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,825
(warriors shouting )

401
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,147
- (whinnying )
- Hy-ah!

402
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,281
Hoo-ah!

403
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,742
На!

404
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,722
(groans )

405
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,601
(armies chanting )

406
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,861
( shouting )

407
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,459
( cheering, groaning )

408
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,236
Erali! Erali!

409
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,951
- What's wrong?
- The Jungars have captured Gahar.

410
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:46,789
Gahar? We have to free her.
Don't tell Mansur.

411
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:51,293
(cheering, chanting )

412
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,358
Forgive me for not being able
to call you my son for so long.

413
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,613
I'm proud of you.

414
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,782
I did my duty.

415
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,160
I avenged my mother.

416
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,793
Tell me about her.

417
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,755
I will.

418
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,428
I promise you.

419
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,682
You mother was a noble woman.

420
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,560
My son.

421
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,572
<i>Oraz: Messengers were sent
to the tribes of the great steppe</i>

422
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,241
<i>to announce that
a new leader had arisen.</i>

423
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,578
<i>Hope began to stir
in the breasts of our people.</i>

424
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,081
<i>And they gave their
new leader a new name-</i>

425
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,292
<i>Ablai.</i>

426
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:20,340
- ( cooing )
- ( men chanting in distance )

427
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,978
Ablai will see no one.

428
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,273
I am Erali!

429
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,151
So be it.

430
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,345
Erali...

431
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,222
I'm leaving.

432
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,520
What happened?

433
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,898
I must go.

434
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:30,410
Erali, we have to be together.

435
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,621
I need you.

436
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,630
Did you know from the beginning
that you were the Sultan's son?

437
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,924
No, I didn't.

438
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:48,595
And it makes no difference to us.

439
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,848
You were a brother to me.

440
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,934
And you are still a brother to me.

441
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,064
Well, if I am still a brother to you...

442
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,984
then you will understand.

443
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,756
I didn't tell him anything, Teacher.

444
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,551
You did the right thing.
People need a leader.

445
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,636
He mustn't leave the city.

446
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,639
Your noble heart knows its course.

447
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,310
I do not have a noble heart.

448
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,148
It's just that I love her.

449
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,325
Erali: Goodbye.

450
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,495
Forgive me, my boy.

451
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,384
(spurs horse )

452
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,184
(whinnying )

453
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,612
Why didn't you stop him, Teacher?

454
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,531
Oraz: I cannot change his destiny.

455
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:41,917
He was born to help you
achieve your mission.

456
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,465
I don't understand.

457
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,509
What is my mission?

458
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:59,142
You were chosen by the stars
to become a warrior

459
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,521
who will unite all Kazakhs.

460
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,917
I shall be leaving you tomorrow.

461
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,383
Why?

462
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,845
There comes a time when a young eagle
must be thrown out of the nest

463
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,597
onto the rocky mountain...

464
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,184
to see how he flies.

465
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,941
Is there anything else I need to know?

466
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,819
Be aware of betrayal.

467
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,333
Great Galdan!

468
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,671
Sharish has been
struck down in battle!

469
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,758
( men heaving, grunting )

470
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,805
Great Khan!

471
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,062
The Kazakhs send us this.

472
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,982
Open it.

473
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,114
They killed him?

474
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,617
A new Kazakh warrior has appeared.

475
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,869
They call him Ablai.

476
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:44,498
Ablai is Mansur!
The wolf cub I told you about.

477
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,917
I warned you to kill this child.

478
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:51,379
So, he does exist.

479
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:52,506
( sobbing )

480
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,967
Silence! I will avenge him!

481
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:00,180
I will avenge him.

482
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,984
( bird crowing )

483
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,576
What news do you bring?

484
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:25,872
(whispering )
This is the time we spoke of.

485
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,226
<i>Mansur/Ablai's voice:
О hallowed tree of my childhood,</i>

486
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,145
<i>I've come to you for strength.</i>

487
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,190
<i>/ pray for wisdom from my ancestors,</i>

488
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,902
<i>and I pray for the safety
of my dear friends...</i>

489
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:59,489
<i>Erali, Gahar.</i>

490
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,283
<i>Where are they now?</i>

491
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,743
<i>/ need their help.</i>

492
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,621
<i>And I miss them...</i>

493
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,267
- (whinnying )
- (rumbling )

494
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,689
( grunting, shouting )

495
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,532
Man: Do not kill him!

496
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:46,620
Galdan wants him alive.

497
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,803
Man: These new weapons
he brought are like thunder itself.

498
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,732
- Sanji.
- Yes, lord?

499
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,817
Can you use these on the Kazakhs?

500
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,695
Yes, Galdan. Easily.

501
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,248
- ( cannon blasts booming )
- ( horses whinnying )

502
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,255
(folk music jangling )

503
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,511
( shouting )

504
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,807
The enemy is ours!

505
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,893
- Victory!
- ( children giggling )

506
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,825
(folk music playing )

507
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,679
It has always been
the custom of the steppe

508
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,181
to treat one's host with respect.

509
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,522
We Kazakhs put our hand upon our heart

510
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,317
when crossing a stranger's threshold.

511
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,155
But how am I to do that
when it is tied behind my back?

512
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,795
I see that you respect
the customs of the nomads.

513
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:05,008
But where is it written that a warrior
is captured away from the battlefield?

514
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,135
It is I who captured you!

515
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,888
So I will cut your head off
like you did my brother's.

516
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,932
You brother was an enemy of my people.

517
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,727
And I killed him in a fair fight.

518
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:20,648
I will honor the commandments
of the nomads.

519
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:28,531
Genghis Khan's captured descendant
cannot be executed.

520
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,327
But he can be forced to face our trials.

521
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,747
If you pass, I will let you go.

522
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:41,044
But if you do not pass,
you will perish in our prison.

523
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,630
It's your choice.

524
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,479
(crowd chattering )

525
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,657
Moonchild!

526
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,576
Hey! Hey, where did you get that horse?

527
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:17,205
It was my father
who gave the horse to me.

528
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,041
It belonged to the Kazakh girl.

529
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,379
Take care of him. He's a good horse.

530
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,841
Give him some yellow grass.
He likes that best.

531
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,409
(grunts ) Hy-ah!

532
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,662
( both grunting )

533
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,045
( groaning )

534
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,340
(giggling)

535
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,622
How did that man know my horse's name?

536
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,709
- What are you talking about?
- The prisoner.

537
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,545
Moonchild recognized him too.

538
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,423
That can't be.

539
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,344
- It's impossible.
- He called him Moonchild.

540
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,473
What else did he say?

541
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:03,394
- He told me he was a good horse.
- Would you like to prove that he is?

542
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:07,190
- How?
- Tomorrow...

543
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,192
(whispering inaudibly)

544
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,417
<i>Mansur/Ablai's voice:
I have let myself be captured.</i>

545
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,046
<i>/ would rather die in battle.</i>

546
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:34,467
О <i>Almighty, help me defend my honor
in the face of the enemy.</i>

547
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,849
Soldier: Get up.

548
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,812
Get up! Time to fight.

549
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,984
(crowd chattering )

550
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,947
( drums pounding )

551
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,378
( shouting, cheering )

552
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,148
(grunting )

553
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,785
Man: Come on, pay up.
Let's go. You too.

554
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,746
The Kazakh won.

555
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,749
He won again.
He's unbeatable. ( chuckles )

556
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,137
- Isn't that your horse?
- Yes, it's my horse!

557
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,643
Untie him.

558
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,569
(spurs horse )

559
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,827
Moonchild. God protect him.

560
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,338
Mansur- please.

561
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,852
(grunting )

562
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,337
(gasps )

563
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,116
(whinnying )

564
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:07,388
You proved that you are
a brave and skillful warrior.

565
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,934
Before you, no one has
ever survived this test.

566
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,273
According to our laws,

567
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:22,945
-1 must now set you free.
- No! No!

568
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,241
He must be killed!

569
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:33,164
Otherwise, the spirit of Sharish
will never rest peacefully.

570
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,459
I respect your grief,
but revenge has blinded you.

571
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,505
If we break our own laws,
our ancestors will turn away from us

572
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,509
and the bond between the living
and the dead will be broken.

573
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,219
What choice do I have?

574
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,764
(laughing )

575
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,475
(grunting )

576
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,144
The prisoner must die in a duel.

577
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,897
And there is one who can defeat him.

578
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,398
Huh?

579
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:11,118
- Where is the prisoner?
- Over there.

580
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,416
Where are you going?

581
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,293
I have food for the Kazakh.

582
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,004
No! You cannot pass.

583
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,007
Get out of here!

584
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,440
Get up, Kazakh!

585
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,196
Listen to me.

586
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,283
Your time has come.

587
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,290
This is your last fight.

588
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:01,085
If you win, great Galdan
will set you free.

589
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,602
Who are you?

590
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,355
I am Hocha, Galdan's daughter.

591
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,900
You were magnificent the other day.

592
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:09,695
Just as you were
when you defeated Sharish.

593
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:15,034
I am honored to hear such praise
from one as beautiful as you.

594
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,328
Unfortunately, you are doomed.

595
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,499
They will not let you live
even if you win the fight.

596
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:25,378
You could lose your head
for telling me this.

597
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,965
I have already lost my head.

598
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:34,553
I have long waited for a warrior
as strong and as brave as you.

599
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:39,850
I know a way to save you.
You must marry a Jungar woman.

600
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:44,355
If you marry me,
you will be a prince of our people.

601
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:49,193
Thank you, but I cannot accept.

602
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,785
Your opponent has
already been brought here.

603
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:00,746
He has never known defeat.

604
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:05,543
Tomorrow, you will
lose your head for certain.

605
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,891
Man: You will never see
your opponent's face.

606
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,269
And he will never see yours.

607
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,105
Put it on.

608
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:33,738
( crowd cheering, shouting )

609
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,735
Begin.

610
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:17,323
( drums thundering )

611
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:38,844
( panting, grunting )

612
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,549
(crowd gasping )

613
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,388
Damn the evil!

614
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:12,605
No!

615
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,065
Curse you, Kazakh!

616
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,418
(groans )

617
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:45,804
I knew it was you—
from the first blow.

618
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,810
Don't show your tears to the enemy.

619
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,150
Do not blame yourself.

620
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,571
We have done what
we were destined to do.

621
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,992
Gahar is here.

622
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,622
Save her.

623
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,673
(whimpering )

624
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:25,970
(weeping )

625
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:56,208
(wailing ) No!

626
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,374
Bury him with the honor he is due.

627
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:42,671
It will be so.

628
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,777
I promised you your freedom.

629
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,698
And you shall have it- tomorrow.

630
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,870
Show him to the tent for honored guests.

631
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,917
Tonight, we will celebrate his victory!

632
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,506
(snake hisses )

633
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,945
More, my poisonous friend.

634
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:51,323
I need enough venom to kill a horse.

635
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:07,214
О Almighty One,
help me to take his life.

636
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,883
(crowd chattering )

637
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,261
- Is there enough?
- Yes, I think so.

638
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,427
For you, honored warrior.

639
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:07,774
Mansur! It's poison!

- No, you are looking at me.

(laughs )

654
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,857
I am not.

655
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,365
You remember I told you
you had the scent of the moon?

656
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:31,376
Do you know what I really wanted to say?

657
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,090
I wanted to say...

658
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,891
I love you.

- ( men shouting )
- ( horses thundering )

661
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:47,369
I sent messengers to all the tribes.

662
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,997
- And the troops?
- Maybe they are late.

663
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,833
What is wrong with us, Father?

664
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,877
We Kazakhs are not helping
each other in this time of need.

665
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,379
My son-

666
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,548
It takes time.

667
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,426
Tribes are trying to gather
their warriors even now.

668
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,010
Yes.

669
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:09,057
I hope that you're right.

670
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:11,017
I'll stall for time.

671
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,996
Honored Ablai, we filled
the tunnels as you ordered.

672
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,914
Very good.

673
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:35,584
What were you doing there?

674
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,752
I want to fight the enemy too, Master.

675
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,963
You're too young.
Go back to your family.

676
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:44,509
I don't have a family.
The Jungars killed them all.

677
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,973
- What do they call you?
- Erali.

678
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:57,689
Erali, come and stay with me, hmm?

679
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,316
Mm-hmm.

680
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:11,578
Man: О Almighty,
hasten the tribes to our rescue.

681
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,623
Grant that with our help we may survive.

682
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,094
The Kazakhs have sent a messenger.

683
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:31,306
Tear him to pieces!

684
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:34,392
Do it!

685
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:41,399

688
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:25,527
That is our fate
if the tribes do not unite.

689
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,822
I give them until morning to surrender.

Honored Ablai,
Sultan Barak is coming.

697
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:20,081
But he's two days away.
The river is flooded.

698
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,500
He's trying to get across.

699
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,004
Get some rest.

700
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:46,524
Don't worry.

701
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:55,200
I saved it.
With this, no one can beat you.

702
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,006
Take care of our child.

01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:52,882
As for Ablai, I command you
to bring me his head.

707
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,488
They will kill all of us.

708
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,911

we are ready to attack.

709
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,333
- We have to wait.
- What?

710
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:28,877
Until they are closer.

711
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,380
Son, we could all escape
through the tunnels.

712
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,383
There is no escape.

713
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:37,761
I ordered them filled with earth oil.

714
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:39,637
Honored Ablai!

715
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,890
- The Sultan is sending men—
- How many?!

716
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,349
( gasping ) I don't know-

717
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:44,976
He is—

718
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:03,286
We'll fight to the death.

719
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:10,145
All great spirits of Kazakh warriors,

720
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:12,063
help us today
in this fight for our land.

721
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,117
Why are we fleeing?

722
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,953
We have them outnumbered
by thousands!

723
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:29,414
Cowards! Stop running!

724
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,332
Fight to the death!

725
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:34,502
All of you! Stop! We are Jungars!

726
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:52,562
Man: The tribes are here!
Reinforcements have arrived!

727
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,086
Let us fulfill our destiny.

728
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,422
- Amen.
- Amen.

729
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,849
(grunting )

730
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,436
На! На!

731
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:30,076
Stay and fight! Cowards! Traitors!

732
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,245
Fight to the death!

733
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:33,579
To the death!

734
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:37,083
Fight! Kill Ablai!

735
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,711
Bring me his head!

736
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:51,973
( screaming, grunting )

737
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,696
(screaming )

738
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,996
<i>Oraz: The battle
by the great walls of Turkistan</i>

739
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:18,708
<i>lasted 100 days and 100 nights.</i>

740
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,797
<i>Blood flowed like rivers
from both sides.</i>

741
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:29,177
<i>As they fought this epic battle,</i>

742
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:33,139
<i>my people finally
came together as one,</i>

743
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:38,436
<i>as our forefathers had under
Genghis Khan many years before.</i>

744
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:42,774
<i>This is how we conquered the Jungars...</i>

745
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:47,278
<i>who had never known defeat.</i>

746
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:09,300
Boy: Let me go!

747
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,386
( boy grunting )

748
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:15,807
Man: Shall I kill him, Ablai?

749
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,642
Kazakhs don't kill children.

750
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,018
Bring him along.

751
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:52,760
This sword belonged to the great Khan,

752
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:56,180
defender of our land.

753
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:59,725
You are his descendant.

754
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:04,355
And now that you have
defeated the Jungar...

755
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:10,278
the Kazakh people
are ready to follow you as one.

756
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:14,365
I will be worthy of their trust.

757
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:27,837
All Kazakhs!

758
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,048
All: Ablai! Ablai! Ablai!

759
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:33,509
Ablai! Ablai! Ablai!

760
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:46,939
Man #1: Who are you?

761
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,775
Man #2: Messengers with a special trust.

762
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:53,738
(whinnying )

763
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:03,080
Grandfather! Grandfather!

764
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:06,125
Come here, my boy. ( sighs )

765
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,714
( sniffs ) Ah...

766
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,301
- What is in the sack?
- Open it.

767
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:17,637
It is the face of the earth.

768
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:29,774
Here are the Tian Shan Mountains.

769
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:32,777
Here live the Indians and the Afghans.

770
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,446
And this is...

771
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:38,491
Ka-za-khia. It is immense.

772
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:41,535
-Who sent this?
- Ablai Khan.

773
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:51,754
"From this day forth,
all Jungars and enemies of our people

774
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:53,756
must know that from the-"

775
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:01,138
<i>Mansur's/Ablai's voice:

<i>must know that from

778

779

<i>by the Kazakhs since ancient times.</i>

780
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:18,823
<i>All who dare to encroach upon this land</i>

781
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:22,368

782
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,704

<i>We will greet our friends
with open arms,</i>

we will show no mercy.</i>
