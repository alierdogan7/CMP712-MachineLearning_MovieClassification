Hit us with a full broadside, cut across

Damn fine gunnery.
Hmm.

We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

come off rather well.

Seven weeks sailing...

146
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,807

00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,077
Hmm.

148
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:37,315
Well, the French have their spies
in England and elsewhere, as do we.

149
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,391
Indeed.

150
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,387

he could have easily stood to sea...

152
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,425

<i>was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman.</i>

It was an unfair match. There was no
dishonor in it. No dishonor at all.

She was more like a ship of the line,
a two-decker, more than a frigate!

156
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,969
You have to wonder about the nature
of her hull. Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

157
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,667
Triple-shotted at 200 yards,
and our guns had no effect.

158
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,870
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

159
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,176
What is the "weather gauge"?

160
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,307
Shall I show you again,

161
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,978
Not on the cloth.

162
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,817
It means she had
the wind in her favor.

163
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,050
Therefore,
control of the engagement.

164
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,390
<i>And she had the longer guns,</i>
<i>which meant she could hit us</i>
<i>beyond our effective range.</i>

165
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,555
The simple fact is

00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,789
- The bottle stands by you.
- Sir.

328
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,689
Sir?

329
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,319
Excuse me, sir,
but Mr. Blakeney said that...

330
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,160
you served under Lord Nelson
at the Nile.

331
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,099
Indeed.
I was a young lieutenant...

332
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,329
not much older
than you are now.

333
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,498
And Mr. Pullings... Mr. Pullings
was a sniveling midshipman...

334
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,508
still yearning
for hearth and home.

335
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,635
- [Chuckling]
- <i>[Calamy] Did you meet him, sir?</i>

336
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,542
Can you tell me
what he's like?

337
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,775
I have had the honor
of dining with him twice.

338
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,717
He spoke to me
on both occasions.

339
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,311
A master tactician and
a man of singular vision.

340
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,756
Well, he always said
in battle:

341
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,327
"Never mind the maneuvers.
Just go straight at 'em."

342
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,559
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

343
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,658
He's England's only hope
if Old Bony intends to invade.

344
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:55,136
Sir, might we press you
for a anecdote?

345
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,270
The first time
that he spoke to me...

346
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,779
I shall never forget
his words.

347
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,577
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

348
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:11,849
He leaned across the table, he looked me
straight in the eye and he said...

349
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:15,050
"Aubrey, may I trouble you
for the salt?"

350
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,059
[Laughter]

351
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,959
I've always tried
to say it exactly...

352
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,397
as he did ever since.

353
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,172
The s...

354
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,172
The second time...

355
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,675
The second time,
he told me a story...

356
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,576
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

357
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,775
<i>And he said no,</i>
<i>he didn't need it</i>...

358
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,148
that he was quite warm.

359
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,278
His zeal for king and country
kept him warm.

360
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:51,520
I know it sounds absurd, and were it
from another man you'd cry out...

361
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:56,396
"Oh, what pitiful stuff,"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

362
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,469
But with Nelson...

363
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,204
you felt your heart glow.

364
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,047
Wouldn't you say,
Mr. Pullings?

365
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,483
You did indeed, sir.

366
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:19,113
Well, then, he would seem to be the
exception to the rule that authority corrupts.

367
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,992
- <i>[Mowett] To Lord Nelson.</i>
- To Lord Nelson.

368
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,064
[All]
To Lord Nelson.

369
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,666
Do you see
those two weevils, Doctor?

370
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,599
I do.

371
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,103
<i>[Jack]</i>
<i>Which would you choose?</i>

372
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,208
Neither. There's not a scrap
of difference between them.

373
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,369
They're the same species
of curculio.

374

to make a choice...

376
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,119
if there was
no other response but to...

377
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,746
Well, then, if you're going to push me.

378
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,126
<i>I would choose</i>
<i>the right-hand weevil.</i>

379
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:01,995
<i>It has significant advantage</i>
<i>in both length and breadth.</i>

380
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,433
There! I have you!
You're completely dished.

381
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,630
Do you not know
that in the service...

382
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,367
one must always choose
the lesser of two weevils?

383
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,501
[Boisterous Laughter]

384
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,482
He who would pun
would pick a pocket.

385
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,451
Really. "Weevils."

386
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,956
To the lesser
of two weevils.

387
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,653

<i>My God. What can we do?</i>

- He has us by the hip.
- Run like smoke and oakum.

- We'll have to bend every sail.
- We'll put up our pocket

and all the gems of Araby.

491
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,800
<i>That's all very well, Nagle.</i>
<i>Gotta get home to spend it.</i>

492
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,072
But I never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

493
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,138
- And I've never met a live one
you've bought one for neither.
- [Laughter]

494
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:17,146
<i>[Killick] Sittin'up all night,</i>
<i>catchin'your death of cold.</i>

495
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,712
[Sighs]
That's the last of the coffee too.

496
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,792
Thank you, Killick.

497
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,230
Bonden?

498
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,097
That's enough easting.
Set a course south-southwest.

499
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:36,571
Aye, sir.
South-southwest.

500
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,106
<i>[Pullings]</i>
<i>Sail!</i>

501
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,341
- <i>Two points off starboard bow!</i>
- I told you.

502
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,317
<i>[Nagle]</i>
<i>Three cheers for Lucky Jack!</i>

503
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:54,585
<i>[Men]</i>
<i>Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!</i>

504
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,856
<i>[Slade]</i>
<i>She's ours, boys!</i>

505
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,536
- [Laughing]
- Foul! Foul!

506
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,972
You got away before me!

507
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,708
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

508
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,516
- Have the idlers placed along the rails.
- Yes, sir.

509
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,586
In all my years,
I've never seen the like.

510
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:27,555
It has to be more than 100 sea miles,
and he brings us up on his tail.

511
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:31,890
That's seamanship, Mr. Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

512
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,690
- <i>I told you the plan would work, Will.</i>
- <i>Thank God you're right.</i>

513
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,288
- We'll have them by nightfall, I think.
- I think we've got him, sir.

514
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,834
<i>[Calamy]</i>
<i>And the wind favors us this time.</i>

515
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,404
Now, don't count your eggs before
they're in the pudding, Mr. Calamy.

516
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,601
<i>Still, if we can close this gap</i>
<i>and get up behind her...</i>

517
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,609
she may well be ours.

518
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,679
Touch wood.
Scratch a stay.

519
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,873
Turn three times!

520
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,916
[All] May the lords and saints
preserve us!

521
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,819
[Laughing]

522
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,125
Turn!

523
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:15,001
Move along, man! Move along!
We'll have lost him before you rig it up!

524
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,198
Hold!

525
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,434
Twelve knots, sir!

526
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,636
That's 12 knots?
That's good.

527
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:26,375
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

528
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:28,508
- Mr. Hollar!
- Aye, sir.

529
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,678
Rouse up the off watch.

530
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,019
All hands on
starboard rail!

531
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:38,424
- <i>[Ship's Whistle Blowing]</i>
- <i>Come up the larboard topsail sheets!</i>
