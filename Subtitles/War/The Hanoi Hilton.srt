          It's a hole.          
       Back of that pipe.       

399
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,833

         on the other side.     

405
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:30,160
   He says he just got himself  
         60 days in irons

   Tell him congratulations on  
 joining the ankle biters' club.

409
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,233
   He says he just got himself  
         60 days in irons       

410
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,151
                And sir,        
        could you do me a favor?

411
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:38,068
   He says he just got himself  
         60 days in irons       

412
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,988
       Uh, ask him how he works 
      the bucket in the stocks.

415
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,109
   He says he just got himself  
         60 days in irons       

416

              hear this.        

423
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,539
 Nobody handed you a discharge  
     when you got captured.     

424

           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

425

              hear this.        

431
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,822
      For the time being,       
    until I hear different,     

432

           In the meantime,

           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

437
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,213
   Firstly, save everything.    

438

           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

445
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,645
You must contact every arrival. 

446

           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

447
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,082

           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

449
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,251
     And we will manipulate     
           the enemy,           

450
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:46,302
           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

451
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,572
        but we will not         
   antagonize him needlessly.   

452
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,840
           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

453
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,861
    You catch more flies with   
     honey than with vinegar.   

454
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,880
           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

455
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,850
 No matter what they do to us,  
       we are Americans.        

456

457
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:06,574
           If we help           
    and support one another,    

458

           In the meantime,     
              hear this.        

459
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:17,835
        we will prevail.        

460
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:25,643
           No thanks,           
      I'm growing a beard.      

461
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,412
              Beat it!          

462
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,956
        Well, maybe just a trim.
        No. You no good.        

463
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,841
       You tough guy.           
        You go away.            

464
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,725
        Well, maybe just a trim.
        No. You no good.        

465
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,180
             MILES:             
         Hey, Einstein.         

466
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,983
      What are you doing?       
  Gassing up the gook H-bomb?   

467
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,785
             MILES:             
         Hey, Einstein.         

468
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:09,237
        Great disguise.         

469
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:09,687
             MILES:             
         Hey, Einstein.         

470
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:10,905
          No, really,           
       you had me fooled.       

471
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:12,122
             MILES:             
         Hey, Einstein.         

472
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,240
           I like it.           

473

          our victory

          is over, major?       

1638

       Yes, comrades.

       Are you saying the war   
          is over, major?       

1642
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:38,970
   Since the valuable footage   
         of the parade,         

1643
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:40,387
       Are you saying the war   
          is over, major?       

1644
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,991
you are of no longer use to us. 
   At least, not as a group.

               you and I.

1648
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,231
         To discuss the method  
            of our release.

           no special cases.

1662
01:14:03,807 --> 01:14:04,839
         ...at religious school,

1663
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,392
     I remember a great deal was
      made of Abraham and Isaac.

1664
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:09,944
         ...at religious school,

1665
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,263
       How God ordered Abraham  
         to sacrifice Isaac,    

1666
01:14:12,264 --> 01:14:14,581
         ...at religious school,

1667
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:17,151
           his only son,        
         his beloved child.     

1668
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,719
         ...at religious school,

1669
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:22,089
             Abraham stood      
        with a knife in his hand

1670
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:25,376
    and wrestled within himself 
   to decide whether to believe,

1671
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,662
             Abraham stood      
        with a knife in his hand

1672
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:29,931
                to trust God.   

1673
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,198
             Abraham stood      
        with a knife in his hand

1674
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:34,602
                Or to deny him. 

1675
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:36,621
     And I suppose that most    
  of us identified with Abraham.

1676
01:14:36,622 --> 01:14:38,639
                Or to deny him. 

1677
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,626
      Wondering how we would use
     free choice if that was us.

1678
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:44,612
                Or to deny him. 

1679
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,883
  Well, since I've been in here,

1680
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,885
              I've had time     
          to think about Isaac. 

1681
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,886
  Well, since I've been in here,

1682
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:53,905

           Tied up on an altar  

1685
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,277
         and audience to what   
     might become his own death.

1686
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:01,595
           Tied up on an altar  

1687
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:02,614
   And he couldn't trust in God.

1688
01:15:02,615 --> 01:15:03,631
           Tied up on an altar  

1689
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,283
      He had to trust in Abraham
          and hope that God     

1690
01:15:05,284 --> 01:15:06,934
           Tied up on an altar  

1691
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,369
       would act through him.   

1692
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,803
           Tied up on an altar  

1693

1694
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:19,280
 in the end, it all worked out  
     for Isaac and Abraham.     

1695
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:20,582
     Just as it will for us.    

1696
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,883
 in the end, it all worked out  
     for Isaac and Abraham.

Well, all my life...            

1701
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:40,601
     I've tried to seek light   
    in the midst of darkness.   

1702
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,971
     And I've learned that      
   the greater the darkness,    

1703
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,957
  the greater the possibility   
           for light.           

1704
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,942
     And I've learned that      
   the greater the darkness,    

1705
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:51,562
     I know that all people     
     are not kind and just.     

1706
01:15:51,563 --> 01:15:55,181
     And I've learned that      
   the greater the darkness,    

1707
01:15:56,953 --> 01:16:03,057

           every day,

that the voice of God speaks    
   through the conscious

1713
