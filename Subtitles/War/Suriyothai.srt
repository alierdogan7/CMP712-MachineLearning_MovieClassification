1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,348
In 1548 the year of the Monkey.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,755
King Maha Chakkraphat became
ruler of the city of Ayothaya.

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,796
Only seven months later

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,996
Ta-beng Schweti King of Hongsawadi

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,992
Ied an invading army out against
Ayothaya.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,400
King Maha Chakkraphat

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,994
Ied his army into battle against
Hongsawadi.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,389
His queen and daughter
rode beside him.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,113
When battle was joined the vanguard

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,193
was routed -confusion reigned
everywhere.

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,994
The queen and the King's daughter
fought bravely from behind

12
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,996
on their elephant until both of
them perished.

13
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,796
The name of the queen who sacrifice
her life so gallantly has passed

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,758
into legend as Queen Suriyothai.

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,753
This is her story.

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,757
In 1 528 the year of the Rat,

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,753
Siam had two kings.

18
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,270
Rama Thibodi ll who
reigned in Ayothaya.

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,073
And his cousin
King Athitaya who ruled

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,594
the northern city of Pitsanulok.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,758
It was a time of peace.

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,593
No battles troubled the reign
of either king.

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,035
Wang Chang, Mount Soi Dao
In 1 528, the year of the Rat.

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,317
In the twelfth month,
King Ayothaya

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,198
journeyed to the Wang Chang on
Mount Soi Dao.

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,989
In his entourage was Princess
Suriyothai of the house of Praruang

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,913
savouring the spectacle of
the elephant round-up.

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,873
Your Highness!.
Don't lean out like that.

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,190
People might see you.

30
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,748
It goes against royal conventions.

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,274
We're on holiday, Nanny.

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,636
Can't I even look at the scenery?

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,474
You're a grown woman now.

34
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,836
Try and behave like one

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,037
-The court rules are quite clear
-Oh, rules, rules, rules.

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,190
I'm worn out with rules I'm sick to
death of rules.

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,959
Will I meet Lord Piren?.

38
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,315
Of course not, Your Highness

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,630
You're not a child any more.

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,280
You can't just go out and meet men.

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,476
It's absolutely forbidden.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,199
Even when the man is
my own brother?.

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,317
Even then?.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,437
Lord Piren isn't really
your brother, Your Highness.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,590
Just a relative

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,353
A distant cousin

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,113
Oh, I am so, so, so, so bored!!

48
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,476
Nanny?.

49
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,511
Your Highness

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,511
I'm dying of thirst.

51
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,956
Have pity. Fetch me a little water.

52
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,393
Your Highness

53
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,875
Kayoon.

54
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,589
Quickly. Take my place

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,717
Your Highness.
This is not a good idea

56
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,759
Where are you going,
Your Highness.

57
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,515
Please let's get back to
the palanquin.

58
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,556
It won't do for you to
be seen in public.

59
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,359
It's a serious violation
against the rules.

60
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,590
Stop fussing Pudkrong.

61
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,272
Lord Piren is not a stranger.

62
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,148
He's my cousin.
Why shouldn't I see him?

63
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,715
I've never set foot outside
the palace before.

64
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,313
Please indulge me

65
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,678
Show me all there is to be seen.

66
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,957
For myself nothing would give
me greater pleasure.

67
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,033
But that you should go back to
the lnner Palace.

68
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,112
For your own sake before you
get caught and punished.

69
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,193
Don't expect me to go
back to the palace.

70
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,636
If you don't like being with me

71
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,870
just say so and leave me.

72
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,871
We need never see each
others faces again

73
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,791
No, no, it's not like
that at all.

74
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,791
You..you are like my life

75
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,394
There's nothing in the world
I could want more, desire more

76
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,993
Iove more than you

77
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,949
Do you mean that?. Honestly?

78
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Or are you lying to me?

79
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,750
Listen to me Suriyothai.

80
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,789
On my honour as a warrior, what
I say now is the absolute truth.

81
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,030
If at any time in the future.

82
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,830
My body or my brain can be of
service to you in any way.

83
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,559
All you have to do is send me word.

84
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,111
I will be beside you before you can
even turn your head

85
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,589
You don't have
to promise quite that much

86
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,071
All I really want is an elephant

87
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,391
That would make me so very,
very happy

88
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,438
That little elephant-he's perfect

89
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,351
Would you catch him for me?

90
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,592
If you want him,
you shall have him

91
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,474
Be careful! It's dangerous
Don't go too close

92
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,799
There's Prince Tien

93
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,600
That's my elephant!!

94
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,592
He's a wild elephant, he belongs
to whoever can catch him

95
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,675
The Crown Prince is here

96
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,076
Is Princess Suriyothai in residence?

97
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,275
Lord Srisurin

98
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,477
Go and fetch
the princess immediately.

99
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,109
The Princess does not wish to see
the Crown Prince.

100
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,395
She refuses?

101
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,599
Come and pay your respects to
the Crown Prince. At once!!

102
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,399
I have no desire to see him

103
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,078
This elephant I have named
Plai Song Tawan.

104
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,678
I caught him with the sole purpose
of presenting him to

105
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,751
Your Highness as a gift.

106
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,554
Lord Srisurin

107
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,191
Thank you for accepting
my invitation

108
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,594
My greatest joy is to honour
Your Highness's wishes

109
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,399
They tell me

110
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,157
you have an EXTREMELY
beautiful daughter

111
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,313
Do you mean Suriyothai?

112
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,790
Presumably

113
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,159
How old is she?

114
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,074
Nearly fifteen.

115
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,673
Ah. My son...

116
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,069
begs me to ask...

117
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,474
your permission for her hand
in marriage.

118
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,518
If it is Your Highness's wish.

119
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,149
I have no objections whatsoever.

120
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,912
Who are you?

121
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,279
From the look of your garments
and demeanour.

122
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,112
She is Suriyothai.

123
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,397
One of the daughters of Lord
Srisurin Governor of Pitsanulok

124
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,278
She is my cousin.

125
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,590
Suriyothai?

126
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,437
Aren't you about to marry
Prince Tien.

127
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,958
-l....
-Don't be afraid to tell me, child.

128
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,918
Think of me as one of the family.

129
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,513
Speak your mind.

130
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,879
With regards to the wedding
between myself and the Prince

131
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,159
You would rather not marry
my nephew?

132
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,629
Suriyothai.

133
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Although I may be the King

134
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,115
but I have no desire to force anyone
into something against their will.

135
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,953
I could change my mind today

136
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
and the whole idea could be forgotten

137
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,238
It would be the easiest thing
in the world.

138
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,348
But..this is what you must consider
it would cause a rift between

139
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,159
Pitsanulok and Ayothaya
which in the long

140
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,310
run might have serious consequences.

141
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,439
Can you live with
that responsibility?

142
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,193
You won't run away again?
Is that understood?

143
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,032
1 529 The Year of the Ox

144
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,908
A white omen appears in the sky.
Indra's arrow

145
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,879
crossing relentlessly from the South
to the Northwest.

146
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,311
Sunday. Eighth day of the waxing moon
of the twelfth lunar month.

147
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,076
King RamaThibodi ll goes into
the chapel

148
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,389
That same night he passes away.

149
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,791
Pitsanulok

150
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,992
His Majesty King Rama Thibodi
is no more.

151
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,759
Long live His Majesty!

152
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,400
May he live ten thousand years.

153
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,874
Long live His Majesty!

154
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,877
May he live ten thousand years.

155
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,671
Today is an auspicious day.

156
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,990
The ninth month
of the year of the Cow.

157
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,832
Thursday.

158
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,831
An auspicious day

159
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,232
on which His Majesty
the great King

160
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,880
Nor Puthangkul

161
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,919
has appointed

162
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,389
by royal decree

163
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,198
the Lady Oon

164
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,910
daughter of Lord Yomaraj

165
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,468
to me the High Consort

166
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,233
from this day forward.

167
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,669
Wang Chai Palace
1 532. The year of the Dragon.

168
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,475
I have come down from Pitsanuloke.

169
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,551
To warn His Majesty that

170
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,155
the Northern provinces are no longer
loyal to Ayothaya

171
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,915
The reason? His Majesty appears to
have lost interest

172
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,752
in the affairs of his Kingdom

173
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,594
He seems not even to care that
the new King of Toungoo

174
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,036
went and thumbed his nose at
the Mon in Hongsawadi

175
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,192
with a mere 500 soldiers

176
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,152
Do you know why he went there?

177
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,036
To stage an piercing ceremony
at Shwe-mawdaw Temple

178
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,795
Hundreds upon hundreds
of Mon soldiers

179
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,917
quaking with fear of a single child

180
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,468
Surely, as the Second King

181
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,838
His Majesty trusted you
to handle these matters on his behalf

182
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,037
That's not the reason.

183
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,434
It's because he can think of nothing
but his new consort. He's infatuated

184
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,797
Why must you treat me with
so much deference?

185
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,599
Are we no longer brother and sister?

186
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,753
Your Highness is now the wife of
the Crown Prince

187
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,718
You shouldn't even be talking to me

188
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,839
I will, with your permission,
take my leave.

189
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,395
I have returned from China

190
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,914
with a special gift for you

191
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,555
What is it?

192
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,077
And what favour are you asking from
my husband in exchange?

193
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,233
I would like you to speak
to your daughter.

194
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,198
My daughter is the High Consort.

195
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,748
The High Consort. Exactly so.

196
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,674
Ask her to talk to her husband.

197
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,116
You mean His Majesty?

198
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,430
His Majesty, yes, His Majesty.

199
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,752
I want her to tell him that

200
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,389
I have some Chinese cannons to sell

201
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,711
If your daughter, the High Consort,
speaks to His Majesty on my behalf

202
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,030
how can he refuse?

203
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,276
And I will give you a commission
of ten per cent.

204
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,593
I, Captain Raj Saneha,
retired officer.

205
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,708
pledge my allegiance to Prince Tien
on behalf of myself and all my men

206
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,678
Why did you leave the army?

207
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,599
Because I wouldn't prostrate myself
before Lord Yommaraj

208
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,959
All those who refused to
grovel to him

209
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,508
were dismissed from service

210
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,876
And now you wish
to serve the Prince?

211
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,033
To Prince Tien
I can submit willingly

212
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,477
without a moment's hesitation

213
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,711
An heir to the throne is born!

214
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,792
Your Highness now has a brother

215
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,116
How can I be the brother
of a Prince?

216
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,270
I am merely the son of
the King's concubine

217
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:49,438
You are still his older brother

218
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,593
I am not worthy to be

219
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,195
the brother of the future King

220
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,034
Each of us has his allotted
share of merit

221
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,195
which has been ordained
from the beginning

222
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,475
No one can change his destiny

223
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,150
In 1 533. The year of the Snake.

224
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,279
The smallpox epidemic sweeps across
the Kingdom. Thousands perish

225
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,552
Promise me..

226
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,395
No, not merely promise.

227
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,835
Swear...

228
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,309
that you will permit

229
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,234
Prince Ratthati-raja kuman...

230
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,992
to become King

231
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,629
by right of accession

232
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,752
Swear...

233
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,957
that neither one of you

234
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,396
will take away the throne

235
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,119
from my son

236
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,431
I swear, Your Majesty

237
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,993
Swear!

238
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,916
I swear, Your Majesty

239
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,072
May the King reign in

240
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,674
good health and happiness

241
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,758
Long live the King!

242
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,471
Ta-beng Shweti's camp outside Bassein.

243
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,558
His Majesty, Nor Puthangkul

244
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,076
has passed away

245
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,357
This is the opportune moment for
Toungoo to attack Ayothaya

246
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,000
Once we've taken Bassein

247
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,799
we'll move on to Ayothaya

248
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,158
We'll get more troops from Bassein.

249
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,992
Ayothaya will crumble in no time.

250
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,277
They'll be hopelessly outnumbered.

251
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,920
One moment, Your Majesty.

252
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,836
I think this is not the moment for
Toungoo onto march on Ayothaya.

253
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,911
How can you say that?

254
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,199
Even though Nor Puthangul has gone..

255
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,957
Yet, the moment Toungoo's troops
enter Ayothaya.

256
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,239
Chai Raja, the Second King,
who reigns in Pitsanulok.

257
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,709
will seize the throne from

258
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,791
Ratthati-raja kuman

259
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,030
so that he can defend the city
against our attack.

260
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,910
He is a fierce and able warrior.

261
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,468
One not to be lightly underestimated.

262
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199
Yes. What you say has
a convincing ring to it.

263
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,353
In any even,
first we must take Bassein.

264
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,668
By tomorrow. I want it by tomorrow.

265
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,669
Fire!

266
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,311
From this moment on

267
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,709
you are no longer Hong

268
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,598
Chinese merchant of Nai Kai

269
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,148
Who am I then?

270
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,470
You are Sir Choduk Raja-sethi.

271
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,710
Commander of the left bank

272
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,950
with sole authority

273
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,077
to set prices..all prices..
for all forms of merchandise

274
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,631
A penny buys only three bowls
of rice?

275
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,153
Yes, Your Highness.

276
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,676
A wagon load costs one pound,
two shillings

277
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,228
and a penny farthing.

278
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,756
Where will we find the money to feed
those who depend on us?

279
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,671
And what about other goods?

280
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,228
All the prices are going up.

281
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,790
Especially if it imported
from China or Portugal.

282
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,552
Then it costs as much as
twice the cost.

283
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,757
At all goes according to
whatever Sir Choduk decides.

284
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,592
I thought so.

285
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,796
Hong is behind this.

286
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,913
Sir Pinit? How much money do we have
in the treasury?

287
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,389
Just enough to see us through
to harvest time.

288
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,677
But we need money for weapons,

289
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,069
Portuguese armour,

290
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,197
uniforms for the Prince's soldiers.

291
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,990
We shall have to make do with
what we have.

292
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,832
But that's impossible.

293
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,233
The old weapons are beyond repair

294
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:07,193
And anyway, a Prince is judged by the
condition of his army and his forces.

295
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,638
If our equipment is shabby
and ineffectual

296
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,188
we will lose face.

297
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,400
Take this. Pawn it with
Seng at Nai Kai canal.

298
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,391
It should fetch you a good price.

299
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,792
Enough to purchase what we need.

300
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,236
Your Highness.
That was your mother's ring!

301
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,753
It's nothing

302
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,799
compared to the Prince's honour.

303
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,071
I must see His Highness.

304
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,195
His Highness is still sleeping.

305
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,748
I must see him. It's absolutely vital.

306
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,752
What is it?

307
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,149
Prince Chai Raja has staged
a coup d'etat.

308
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,800
He led his army down from Pitsanulok

309
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,474
and seized the throne!

310
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,637
Your Highness!

311
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,429
Sanpet Prasat throne hall.

312
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,592
In 1 534, the Year of the Horse.

313
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,557
Your Highness!

314
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,359
Help us. Please!

315
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,432
Help me!

316
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,030
Put away your weapons. At once!

317
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,431
Why have you done this?

318
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,954
You swore an oath.

319
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,713
You swore to accept Prince Rattha
as your sovereign.

320
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,519
In the presence of all things sacred,
you gave your word!

321
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,431
What do you suggest I do?

322
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,593
Let the people go on suffering

323
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,908
as they are suffering now?

324
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,675
Spare me your hypocrisy.
You want the throne!

325
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,716
It's as simple as that
It was mine from the beginning.

326
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,599
But I took pity on a dying man.

327
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,319
For five long months,
I kept careful watch

328
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,679
to see how the Regent
and his cronies

329
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,149
would rule the Kingdom

330
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,995
Since Ratthathiraj came to power

331
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,356
the city has been in turmoil

332
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,194
Even worse, many provinces
have switched their allegiance

333
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,919
from Ayothaya

334
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,878
to Toungoo.

335
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,316
Sooner or later

336
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,198
Ayothaya will be overrun

337
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,831
and succomb to the power and
might of King Ta-beng Shweti.

338
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,878
For this reason.

339
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,751
I had to break my oath
to a late King.

340
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,397
What will happen to the boy?

341
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,073
Where are you, Mummy?

342
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,911
Mummy!

343
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,276
Where are you?

344
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,272
I'm frightened!

345
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,920
Help me!

346
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,949
Take me back to bed.

347
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,716
-I want to go back to sleep.
-Wait.

348
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,556
Let the Lady Worachan
attend to His Majesty.

349
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,949
I'm frightened.

350
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,600
Hush, there's no need to be afraid.

351
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,390
I'm here. I'm right beside you.

352
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,590
Mummy!
Where are you?

353
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,750
Mummy!

354
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,838
This will never happen again!

355
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,913
Whatever the circumstances.

356
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,278
There will be no more
of this kind of killing.

357
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:03,076
I think Prince Chai Raja
did the right thing.

358
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,630
The right thing?
Killing an innocent child?

359
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,029
Yes.

360
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,989
Sacrificing one life,
however innocent

361
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,755
to end bloodshed across the Kingdom.

362
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,116
It's Prince Chai Raja
who is shedding the blood..

363
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,270
That's not true.

364
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,397
The Second King knew

365
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,595
that if he did nothing

366
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,114
it would mean the end of Ayothaya.

367
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,430
If you were in his place.

368
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,195
You would have done the same.

369
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,111
Never. I would never do that.

370
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,714
No matter what

371
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,429
the innocent should never suffer.

372
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,348
It was in the year 1 534,
The year of the Horse

373
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,318
that the young King was executed and

374
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,552
King Chai Raja ascended the throne.

375
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,589
In 1 535 The Year of the Goat

376
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,349
It seems that I can no longer

377
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:22,120
carry out my duties.

378
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,509
I am the Lord of Life.

379
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,717
Highest in the Kingdom.

380
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,952
I will not let you die.

381
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,792
Even the Lord of Life

382
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,273
cannot defy the Lord
of the Underworld.

383
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,235
I.. humbly..take my leave.

384
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,312
Jitravadee!
Jitravadee!!

385
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,030
The Queen Jitravadee

386
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,078
gave birth to the Prince Yodfa

387
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,948
then bled to death.

388
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,798
So doing. She opened the way
for Princess Srisudachan

389
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,472
of the House of U-Thong.

390
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,395
She was appointed Royal Consort to
the King Chai Raja.

391
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,679
What is your name?

392
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,273
Boonsri, Your Majesty.

393
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,590
I hold the rank of Royal Steward.

394
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,558
Custodian of the Outer Hall
housing the Buddha images.

395
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,757
So. Are you descended
from the U-Thong dynasty?

396
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,512
I am, Your Majesty.

397
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,434
They tell me that you are
an exceptional singer.

398
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,637
They flatter me, Your Majesty.

399
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,750
Sing a verse for me.
I will decide if that is flatterey.

400
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,754
That fellow Boonsri,
who sang for His Majesty.

401
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,229
Custodian of the Outer Hall.

402
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,232
He holds the rank of steward.

403
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,673
The Outer Hall.

404
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,510
That's the residence of

405
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,989
Pra Matamatayikka, Her Royal
Great Grand Mother, isn't it?

406
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:01,835
Yes. Her Highness resides at
Piman Rattaya Hall.

407
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,199
Perhaps it's time we presented
ourselves to Her Highness.

408
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,989
Pimam Rattaya Hall, Front Palace.

409
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:32,199
Sroy, take this betel nut
and give it to that steward.

410
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,070
Tell him it is a reward

411
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,720
for his singing,
which has touched me deeply.

412
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,518
Yes, My Lady.

413
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,229
The High Consort instructs me
to bring you this gift.

414
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,993
A reward for pleasing her
with your melodious renditions.

415
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,639
Your visit here today...

416
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,712
was no accident.

417
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,640
You are fulfilling

418
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,633
the desires of those ancestors

419
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,598
from whose shades nothing is hidden.

420
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,989
The usurping dynasty of Suphanna-bhumi

421
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,790
has taken over the throne
of the U-Thong

422
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,519
for far too long.

423
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,876
Very soon

424
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,838
you will understand what I am saying

425
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,950
if the U-thong blood
runs strong in your veins.

426
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,269
I came to inform Your Highness.
That a few days from now.

427
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,112
I take my vows as a nun

428
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,112
If that is what you truly desire.

429
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,069
I wish you every happiness.

430
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,038
No matter what happens

431
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,588
the House of
Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj

432
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,195
will always honour the House of
Suphanna-bhumi and offer obeisance

433
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,952
for generations to come.

434
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,510
But one thing more.
Never trust Srisudachan.

435
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,478
Watch her closely.

436
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:46,759
Be on your guard against
this High Consort.

437
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,469
She is not what she seems to be.

438
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,191
In 1 538. The year of the Dog.
