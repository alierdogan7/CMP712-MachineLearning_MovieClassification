476
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,300
- You did?
- It's funny. You know what
I'm looking forward to the most?

477
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,461
All the things I used to avoid... Cleaning
the garage, clearing out the rain gutters.

478
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:05,461
- Yeah. I got that here on Mildred's list.
- Fixing the holes in the screens.

479
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:08,502
Yep. Right here.
You got clipping the azaleas?

480
00:32:08,582 --> 00:32:11,102
I have to prune
the lemon tree.

481
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:14,302
You know, to some people, things like that
can sound pretty boring.

482
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:18,103
Yeah, look at this list.
Not an interesting thing on it!

483
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:22,383
There was a time when Peg just couldn't get
me involved in that stuff. It didn't seem exciting.

484
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:26,224
Just one boring thing...
after another.

485
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,464
I tell you. Right now, I feel like I could
do chores like that for the rest of my life.

486
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:34,265
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna be doin' em
for the rest of my life.

487
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:37,585
Hmm.

488
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:42,946
Chorwon is very close.
You get jeep, we be there in one hour.

489
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:44,866
We be back by dinnertime.

490
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:47,946
Soon-Lee, we go to Chorwon,
we'll have Chinese food for dinner.

491
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,867
The enemy's all over the place
up there.

492
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:52,067
- Did you find me a surgeon yet?
- Don't you read the papers?

493
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,067
There's fighting going on.
All the spare doctors are in Kumsong.

494
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:59,668
Not all of them. I happen to know Artie Jacobson
is sitting around Tokyo with nothing to do.

495
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:02,908
- Okay, I'll ask him.
- Don't ask him. Tell him. I want to go home.

496
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:06,709
Boy, what a lucky guy.
I'd give anything to be back in Toledo.

497
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:08,669
Sitting in Packo's
with the guys...

498
00:33:08,749 --> 00:33:11,709
having a beer and eating a dog while
the chili sauce drips down your arm.

499
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,070
<i>- [Explosions]
- [People Shouting]</i>

500
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,990
Course,
this is nice too.

501
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,430
No patrol can find them!

502
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,671
As soon as they fire off three rounds,
they must pack up and move to a new location!

503
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:29,471
What? Oh, yeah.
I understand, Colonel.

504
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:33,432
"L" Corps. I am specifically ordered
not to touch that tank...

505
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:35,832
and it may be days
before the owner comes and gets it.

506
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:38,152
Why don't you just tell 'em
this is a hospital?

507
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:40,433
As long as that tank is here,
we're a target!

508
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,113
Boy, you must think
I am the biggest dunce...

509
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,953
since the monkey wrapped his tail
around the flagpole.

510
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:49,474
Don't you think that's
what I told him?

511
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,994
I can take care of my job.
You go act like a sergeant!

512
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,314
Unless... you want to try
something lower!

513
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:01,675

514
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:09,436

516
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:17,717
Is he any calmer? He was talking
a mile a minute the last time I saw him.

517
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:20,597
We made progress,
but we're not done yet.

518
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:23,918
So do you think I should tell him
I'm going home soon? Would that throw him?

519
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:26,758
Good question.
Why don't you just play it by ear?

520
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:30,118
<i>[Hawkeye]
Yeah?</i>

521
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,479
- I brought you a present.
- Hi.

522
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,359
Look at you. Just visiting,
or did you get a leak in your beanbag?

523
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:40,720
- I missed you.
- Yeah, me too.

524
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,080
I have to go read a few inkblots.
I'll see you guys later.

525
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:51,401
I'd have brought the whole still, but it would
have been tough to sneak past the guards.

526
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,002
Mmm.

527
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:01,682

- We're keeping busy.

528
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:04,643
Well, it's a nice location.
You get a lot of drop-in business.

529
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,323
I'll be glad to
give it all up to go home.

530
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:09,243
What makes you think
you're going home?

531
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:12,923
Well, you know, eventually.
Someday we're gonna get outta here.

532
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,364
Seems like the whole world
has gone by while we've been here.

533
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:18,004
You know, Erin's
second birthday's coming up?

534
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,645
Last time I saw her, she was so small,
her hand wouldn't fit around my finger.

535
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:25,845
She wore these little baby booties
you could fit into a shot glass.

536
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:30,246
You know, I wear the same boots
I got when I came here.

537
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,886
Yeah. Well, anyway,
I really miss her...

538
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:39,807
even though just about the only thing
I remember is her big, toothless grin.

539
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:43,527
Yeah, well, that's the thing, see?
Toothless grin?

540
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:47,408
Fingers, boots, shot glasses. There's a common
thread running through all of this.

541
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:51,848
You could've said twine, toothbrushes,
chewing gum under the seat at the theater.

542
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:54,608
I found chewing gum under the seat
at the Rialto in Kennebunkport.

543
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:58,049
<i>Charles Boyer was trying to drive
Ingrid Bergman crazy in Gaslight.</i>

544
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:00,489
The light's going dim!
No, it's not. You're crazy.

545
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:03,489
Now, she knew she wasn't going crazy.
The audience knew she wasn't going crazy.

546
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:07,330
And this French guy is trying to have her
put away! Now I'd like to know why!

547
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,810
<i>All right, she had a Swedish accent, but we're
still talking about an American citizen here.</i>

548
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:18,091
I wanna know where they get
the gall to lock up a surgeon!

549
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:20,892
<i>And I'm talking about the finest surgeon
you'll ever see.</i>

550
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:28,012
- Sidney?
- I'll tell you. They're not keeping me here.

551
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:30,853
There are people I can call, you know...
very highly placed people.

552
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:33,533
- What's up?
- Oh, hi. We were just talking about you.

553
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:35,493
I'm sorry if I got you
a little agitated.

554
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:39,094
I'm not even miffed yet.
You wanna see agitated?

555
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:44,054
I can be aggravated, infuriated, frustrated,
"vexated" and irritated.

556
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:47,015
Maybe Hawkeye and I
should talk alone for a while.

557
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:49,575
[Chuckles]
Yes, why don't we do that?

558
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,055
Go. What are you
waiting for?

559
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:56,736
I don't know.
I... I... just thought...

560
00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:59,536
there might be something we wanted to say
to each other before I left.

561
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:03,057
Tell me next time you see me. I'm not gonna
be here forever. I can guarantee you that!

562
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,737
Yeah.

563
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,857
Well. I'll see you.

564
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:19,739
You wanna tell me what you
and B. J. Were talking about?

565
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:22,659
- Same thing he always talks about.
- What's that?

566
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,379
Fingers, smiles, teeth.

567
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,660
- Booties.
- Was there anything about that
you found upsetting?

568
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,380
No. I'll tell you what I find
upsetting is being in here.

569
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,300
I want you to get me out of here!
I don't care how you do it!

570
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,461
You can put me on a plane, on a train,
on a bus, on a slow boat to China.

571
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,061
I'll go out on a mouse-drawn chariot.
I don't care what!

572
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:44,501
- A bus, huh?
- Again with the bus?

573
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:47,622
<i>Why don't you subscribe to
Arizona Highways and leave me alone?</i>

574
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:49,622

578
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:06,704
Then what happened?

579
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:08,704
Then I went back toward
the front of the bus.

580
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:10,305
What happened next?

581
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,345

00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:27,707

She killed the chicken?

00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:29,514
You had to get it
out in the open.

00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:31,714
Now we're halfway home.

598
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,596
And then I started thinking.
It's like my Uncle Jameel used to say:

00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,316
If you wanna hide in the desert,
you gotta look like sand.

600
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:51,036
I was already asleep. I don't need to hear
a bunch of Lebanese fairy tales.

601
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,197
Sorry to wake you, Colonel, but we could
only do this under the cover of darkness.

602
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:58,357
Wait a minute, what's this tent doing here
where the... tank used to be?

603
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:01,798
And to make extra sure,
there's a big red cross on the roof too.

604
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,318
You know, we may just
fool 'em with this.

605
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:08,839
It's an old Bedouin trick. Back in the old
country, my Uncle Jameel was a camel rustler.

606
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,119
[Thinking] Dear Dad. Sorry I haven't
written for a while...

607
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,840
but I've been on R & R
at this wonderful resort.

608
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
We're planning to have
a bridge tournament here...

609
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,560
as soon as we can find somebody
with a full deck.

610
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,121
Dear Dad.

611
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,041
Remember when I was a kid,
you always told me...

612
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,042
if my head wasn't attached
to my shoulders, I'd lose it?

613
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:36,002
Well...

614
00:40:39,362 --> 00:40:43,363
Dear Dad. For the first time,
I understand what a nervous disorder is...

615
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,363
because it seems
I've got one.

616
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,603
I guess I'll be seeing you soon
since I doubt if they'll let a surgeon operate...

617
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:51,084
whose cheese has
slipped off his cracker.

618
00:40:52,604 --> 00:40:56,444
- Time to hit the couch?
- Actually, it may be time to hit the road.

619
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:59,165
How would you feel
about moving on?

620
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:02,845
You just have the bellhop
bring me my pants, I'll be on my way.

621
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,725
Sidney, it's been a pleasure.
Soon as I get back to Maine...

622
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:08,726
I'm gonna have a memorial
lobster in your honor, cracked, of course.

623
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,806
How about a little hug
for the road?

624
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:16,127
I hate to break this to you, but you're not
going home. You're going back to the 4077.

625
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,807
Does this mean
I'm not getting the hug?

626
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,847
You're sending a crazy man back to the place
where he got crazy in the first place?

627
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:26,448
- Are you out of your mind?
- Look, you know, when a soldier
reacts to the stress of combat...

628
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,848
we get him back to his foxhole
as soon as we can.

629
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:32,208
We have to get you
right back to the O.R.

630
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:35,089
Listen, a couple of days ago,
I fell all to pieces in there.

631
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:39,929
- I thought we had to have more sessions.
- We've had them.

632
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:41,890
So now you're just
dumping me back there again?

633
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,570
Well, I'm going to drop in on you from time
to time, see how you're doing.

634
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,331
Why don't we compromise? Send me to a foxhole
in Crabapple Cove. You can drop in on me there.

635
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,731
I'm afraid of lobsters.

636
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,451
I'll have the bellhop
bring you your pants.

637
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:11,293
[Engine Stops]

638
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:18,534
Hi. Uh, g-good morning. I wonder if I could
lighten your mailbag by one letter.

639
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:20,534
The name is Winchester,
Charles E.

640
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:24,575
Sorry, Major. Nobody opens this sack
till I get a receipt from your company clerk.

641
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:27,455
Oh, now, well, see,
this is a letter from a hospital.

642
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:29,855
I don't care if it's from Dr. Pepper.
I need a receipt.

643
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,096
<i>[Chuckles]
Dr... Pepper.</i>

644
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:35,816
Uh-huh. I can get you on a flight
out ofTokyo to Guam.

645
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:37,736
From there,
a steamer to Seattle.

646
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,937
Can you get me to Honolulu?
I can hitch a flight from there to San Francisco.

647
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,097
What about that boat from,
uh, Okinawa to Honolulu?

648
00:42:45,177 --> 00:42:50,818
Yeah? Yeah? Kimpo, Okinawa,
Honolulu, San Francisco.

649
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:53,098
That's it! That's it!
That's the one I want!

650
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:55,298
But the plane leaves
Kimpo in 40 minutes.

651
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:57,218
- Got anything else?
- Oh, come on! What is this?

652
00:42:57,299 --> 00:42:59,859
<i>- [Klinger] I don't care! Be creative!
- There is your company clerk.</i>

653
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:01,779
- Now can I please have my mail?
- Sign here.

654
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:03,939
- One second. One second.
- Can you get me to Midway?

655
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,900
Wait a minute.
I'm still working on Honolulu.

656
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,020
Sergeant, come on.
I'm due in Kimpo in 20 minutes.

657
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,020
Kimpo? Wait a minute.
You got room for a passenger?

658
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,260
Yeah, I got room,
but I gotta leave right away.

659
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,821
- You give me 10 minutes,
I'll meet you on the chopper pad.
- Five.

660
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:16,621
- You got it. Klinger?
- You got it. Kimpo.

661
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:21,101
- Klinger, sign.
- Corporal, get me that flight from Kimpo.

662
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:23,142
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

663
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:25,062
Thank you.

664
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:27,662
<i>Five minutes? I haven't got
your replacement yet.</i>

665
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:32,463
Jacobson's due here first thing in the morning.
This is the only connection I could get.

666
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,383
Oh, what the heck.

667
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:37,063
Send me a piece
of birthday cake.

668
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:39,143
Thank you.

669
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:43,984
- Look, l... This is not the way I wanted to...
- Go! You're fighting the clock.

670
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:47,945
- Captain, you're on the flight.
I even got you a window seat.
- Oh, Klinger, you're...

671
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:50,225
- I'm really gonna...
- That's how I feel, sir.

672
00:43:50,305 --> 00:43:52,745
Captain, I'm leaving here at
10 after with or without you.

673
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:55,065
- Whoo-hoo!
- I gotta leave a note for Hawkeye.

674
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:57,626
- Give me a piece of paper and a pencil. Charles...
- [Mumbling]

675
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:59,546
- Charles...
- Here you are, sir. Better hurry.

676
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:04,066
I got the job! Someone on the board
gave me a rousing endorsement.

677
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:07,267
- Charles, I've got to go.
- Fine, fine. Yes, you do that.

678
00:44:07,387 --> 00:44:09,507
- Thanks, Charles.
- [Laughing]

I'm goin' home!

681
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:20,348
Whoo-hoo!
Hoo, hoo!

682
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:23,109
I'm goin' home!

00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:27,109
Uh...

685
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:30,390
Uh...

686
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,430
- Captain.
- Right, right, right.

687
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,910
Here, uh, throw some of
this stuff in that suitcase for me, will ya?

688
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,911
Get everything in that bag
that you can.

689
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:40,911
I'll try not to
wrinkle your shorts.

690
00:44:41,031 --> 00:44:42,911
You're leaving
and you didn't say good-bye?

691
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:44,911
Well, you know how
insensitive I can be.

692
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:50,432
Hunnicutt, when people share a tent for such
a long time, they can become quite close.

693
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:53,032
Of course, that didn't
happen in our case.

694
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:54,952
But there is such a thing
as common courtesy.

695
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:57,713
Charles, there's a kid in post-op
with a perforated descending colon.

696
00:44:57,793 --> 00:45:00,433
- Check him for fever, okay?
- Certainly. Anything else?

697
00:45:00,513 --> 00:45:04,954
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there is.
But I better handle it myself.

698
00:45:07,714 --> 00:45:11,954
- Father! Father! I'm leaving now.
- What? You're leaving?

699
00:45:12,034 --> 00:45:14,995
I've just got a minute.
I want to check your ears before I go.

700
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:17,755
- What do you hear?
- I hear your watch ticking.

701
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:19,915
- What do you hear in that ear?
- Same thing, your watch.

702
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:22,076
Really? I just put it
in my pocket.

703
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,636
Well, in that case, I couldn't hear it
in the other ear, either.

704
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,076
Your hearing is not improving.
I think it's getting worse.

705
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:30,477
In a few weeks, you may not be able to hear
at all. You gotta go home.

706
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,917
You're going home to your child.
My children are still here.

707
00:45:34,037 --> 00:45:37,878
<i>- [Footsteps Approaching]
- Let's go, Doc. It's now or never.</i>

708
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:41,078
- Look, Father...
- Come on. I gotta make it to Kimpo. I can't wait.

709
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:43,358
I'm coming.

710
00:45:43,478 --> 00:45:46,039
So long, Father.

711
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,559
Good-bye, B. J.
God bless you. And thank you.

712
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,800
Hey, look, put this in the chopper for me,
will you? I'll just be a second.

713
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,520
Margaret, I got a flight
at the last minute. I'm leaving.

714
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,480
Leaving? Now?

715
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,281
Will you talk to Hawkeye for me?
I tried to leave him a note.

716
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,201
- There's just too much to say.
- Oh, l... l...

717
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:09,121
<i>- I wanted to give you a big send-off.

Captain Hunnicutt's

721
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:34,644
What should I do?

722
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:52,006
Now what was all that, son?
I couldn't hear you over the chopper.

723
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:54,727
Nothing, sir.
I guess it's too late now.

724
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:57,927
By the way, if we get any mail from
"l" Corps, put it on my desk.

725
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:01,407
- I'll look at it in, oh, an hour or so.
- Right, sir.

728
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,208
Get out of my way!

00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,649
<i>- [Explosion]
- I thought you said you had
everything under control?</i>

730
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:17,729
I did. Even I was fooled by that tent.
I almost delivered mail there.

731
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:20,330
Well, it didn't fool them.
They know that tank's here someplace.

732
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:24,010
They ain't seen it driven out in the daytime
and they ain't heard it driven out at night.

<i>[Explosion]</i>

734
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,771
Okay, that's three. Get "l" Corps
on the phone. Time to kick some ear.

735
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:33,771
After that, I want you to send out
this telegram here. There.

736
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:36,652
Hello, Sparky, get me
headquarters, "l" Corps.

737
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,052
You want to express your gratitude to who...
Dr. Tearbug?

738
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:42,892
Torborg. It's Dr. Torborg. Chief Administrator,
Boston Mercy Hospital.

739
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:45,293
- You're kissing up the wrong tree.
- I beg your pardon.

740
00:47:45,373 --> 00:47:49,213
Yeah, "l" Corps? This is MASH 4077.
Tank towing, please.

741
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:52,493
- This ain't the guy who got you your job.
- And how would you know?

742
00:47:52,573 --> 00:47:56,454
Because Major Houlihan
sent her telegram to a whole other guy.

743
00:47:56,534 --> 00:47:59,974
<i>- What do you mean she sent a telegram?
- Who's this?</i>

744
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:05,295
Good. Hang on to your treads. Colonel Potter
wants to say a few obscene words to you.

745
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,295
You're on, Colonel! I mean,
she recommended you to her uncle...

746
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:11,136
- who's not her uncle, but he runs the hospital.
- You mean Dr. Robert Harwell?

747
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:15,016
- Uncle Bob!
- What?

748
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:18,137
- What?
- Gee! Don't get so choked up about it.

749
00:48:18,257 --> 00:48:22,417
- You want me to change Tearbug to Uncle Bob?
- How... dare...

The thought, "What if something
goes wrong?" never occurred to me.

Now I'm thinking that a lot.

Charles, I just got another letter from my father!
And guess what!

00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:13,503
He's lined up an even
better assignment for me.

765
00:49:13,623 --> 00:49:16,343
Listen to this.
He says forget Tokyo.

766
00:49:16,463 --> 00:49:20,184
He knows somebody who can get me assigned
to NATO Headquarters in Belgium.

767
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:22,464
Isn't that great?

768
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,144
Of course, Dad says
I should write a tactful letter to his friend...

769
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:27,065
backing out of
the other job in Tokyo.

770
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:30,425
Hmm. Gee, that's kinda tricky. Maybe you
could help me with that. You're good with words.

771
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:34,066
Oh, I don't know, Margaret. You don't seem
to have any problem using words.

772
00:49:34,146 --> 00:49:37,306
You know what's funny? I already sent away
for Japanese language records.

773
00:49:37,426 --> 00:49:41,546
And now I'm gonna have to change them
to Flemish. [Laughing]

774
00:49:41,626 --> 00:49:43,467
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

775
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,427
The minute this war is over,
I intend to be ready.

776
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,547
By the way, I believe
you still have my copy...

00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:56,108
Let me count the ways.

00:49:56,188 --> 00:49:58,908
I trust I may count
on its return?

781
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:03,469
- Oh. I sort of thought you hated it.
- I do. I loathe it.

782
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:08,310
It's romantic drool. A book that could
only be read in a bad painting.

783
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:12,710
- But you want it back.
- Well, it is a volume three of a four-volume set.

784
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,991

01:13:59,799 --> 01:14:01,759
Hi. I saw you come in.

1100
01:14:01,879 --> 01:14:04,680
Does the fact that you're here
mean I'm not all there?

1101
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,320
I heard you took
a tank for a spin.

1102
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,801
Everybody was getting shelled on account
of that tank, and I got rid of it.

1103
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:13,121
You call that crazy?

1104
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:16,121
Actually, that might have been
the sensible thing to do.

1105
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:20,682
But I am curious about why
you walked away from that kid just now.

1106
01:14:20,802 --> 01:14:23,002
Yeah, well, maybe
you got me there.

1107
01:14:24,722 --> 01:14:27,042
I was looking at her and all of a sudden
I noticed...

1108
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:30,123
I had a butterfly collection
loose in my stomach.

1109
01:14:31,603 --> 01:14:35,003
Being around little kids
makes me uncomfortable these days.

1110
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:39,844
- I guess that's something we have to work on.
- Mmm.

1111
01:14:39,964 --> 01:14:42,364
What else have you
been going through?

1112
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,645
Yesterday, I spent a year
in the operating room.

1113
01:14:45,725 --> 01:14:48,525
I was up to my ankles
in panic.

1114
01:14:48,645 --> 01:14:52,885
[Sighs]
I'm a little out of control, Sidney.

1115
01:14:53,006 --> 01:14:55,846
Surgery used to be
like falling of a log.

1116
01:14:57,486 --> 01:14:59,726
Now it's more like
falling off a cliff.

1117
01:15:02,087 --> 01:15:05,567
You know, just because you're a doctor
doesn't mean you're supposed to be perfect.

1118
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:08,127
- Your patients aren't.
- Yeah.

1119
01:15:08,207 --> 01:15:10,808
They have pain,
they're afraid.

1120
01:15:10,928 --> 01:15:15,248
Actually, they're probably
better off if you know how they feel.

1121
01:15:15,368 --> 01:15:18,168
Might make being a surgeon
a little harder...

1122
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:20,449
but it might make you
a better doctor.

1123
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:25,929
Well, anyway, that's
something to think about.

1124
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:31,850
- I can't sleep.
- Well, then you should take something.

1125
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,930
No. If I sleep,
then I talk.

1126
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:38,571
If I don't talk, I think. I think too fast.
If I could just slow down my thinking.

1127
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:40,491
I just think too fast,
that's all.

1128
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:43,892
I don't think we have to
make a big deal out of this, you know?

1129
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,092
So I think too fast
and I'm afraid of children.

1130
01:15:46,172 --> 01:15:48,692
That's... That's not...
That's not terrible.

Either stop lovin' 'em
or love 'em a whole lot more.

But if you love 'em
a whole lot more...

won't that just get you
a lot more trouble?

1208
01:21:41,974 --> 01:21:44,614
Yup. Then you
love 'em even more.

1209

01:22:07,017 --> 01:22:08,977
- [Woman] Oh, yeah.
- How about you, Colonel?

1218
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:12,618
- What's the first thing you want

- Well, I like fresh corn.

1219
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:14,658
I mean, real fresh corn.

1220
01:22:14,778 --> 01:22:19,458
So I think maybe I'll just take a hot plate out
to the garden, make a pot of boiling water.

1221
01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:21,539
Then I won't even
pick that corn.

1222
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:24,739
I'll bend that stalk,
till the ear dips into the water...

1223
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:26,939

right there standin' up.

What are you looking forward to?

Hemostat. There's no need
to bite my head off.

- Sponge.

1229
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:43,461

try to help them.

1231

somebody cares enough to help.

a piece of you in every corner of the world.

1235
01:23:00,623 --> 01:23:04,424
Maybe some people
just can't feel gratitude.

1236
01:23:04,504 --> 01:23:07,624
Maybe some people like having
other people run their lives.

1237
01:23:07,704 --> 01:23:09,664
But some people don't.

How? You'll be on one coast
and I'll be on the other.

1257
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:02,671
Letters, phone calls.
Maybe a surgical convention.

1258

<i>- ##[Continues]
- Can you picture either one of us
at a convention?</i>

1259

No, I guess not.

1260

We'll never
see each other again.

1261
01:24:12,712 --> 01:24:16,952
- Look, one year Erin and Peg and I'll come east.
- One year.

1262
01:24:17,072 --> 01:24:19,153
Yeah, and, um...
And we'll get together and, um...

1263
01:24:19,273 --> 01:24:22,233
- Have dinner.
- Yeah.

1264
01:24:22,353 --> 01:24:24,153
In other words, good-bye.

1265
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:26,713
- It's not good-bye.
- It is good-bye. What's the big deal?

1266
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:29,314
- Just say good-bye.
- What do you want me to say it for?

1267
01:24:29,394 --> 01:24:32,114
It shows you know I'm going.
What would you do if I was dying?

1268
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:35,515
Hold me and let me die in your arms
or just let me lay there and bleed?

1269
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:38,835
What are you talking about?
You're not dying. You don't even have a cold.

1270
01:24:38,915 --> 01:24:42,395
- Come on. Just a little "so long."
- I'm gonna get back to the O.R.

1271
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:44,516
Good-bye.

President Eisenhower is expected to ask for...

1274
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:55,397
an emergency relief fund of $200 million
to rebuild the war-torn Korean economy.

1275
01:24:55,477 --> 01:25:00,197
<i>Another 200 million may be allocated for
the reinforcement of the Vietnam army...</i>

<i>It is now three hours before

- Southeast Asia, he said.

<i>[Man On P.A.]

Half his chest is gone.

do for him, Doctor?

Doctor?

1293
01:25:58,044 --> 01:26:00,605
He wasn't even a soldier.

1294
01:26:00,725 --> 01:26:03,565
He was a musician.

1295
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:06,125
What happened to the other people
in the truck with him?

1296

1416
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:50,540
I'm goin' back to Colorado.
My father-in-law's got a ranch there.

1417
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,261
I wanna see if I can
get into radiology.

1418
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,221
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- [All Laugh]

1419
01:33:55,301 --> 01:34:00,021
Well, as you know, I was all set to go back
to Mill Valley to Peg and Erin and all that...

1420
01:34:00,101 --> 01:34:03,302
but I'll tell you,
I had the best time on Guam.

1421
01:34:03,382 --> 01:34:07,182
I met this cookie at the airport bar
and she begged me to run off with her.

1422
01:34:07,262 --> 01:34:09,943
And I figured, what the hell?
You only live once, you know?

1423
01:34:13,303 --> 01:34:16,023
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding. Just kidding.

1424
01:34:19,704 --> 01:34:22,904
He's just kidding.
That's all.

1425
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:25,024
I'm gonna do something where
people don't yell at me...

1426
01:34:25,144 --> 01:34:27,065
when I put the food down
in front of'em.

1427
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:28,985
I'm gonna be a pig farmer.

1428
01:34:31,385 --> 01:34:34,866
What do you mean "gonna be"?

1429
01:34:34,986 --> 01:34:39,146
Well, l... I was a nurse
at the tail end of World War II.

1430
01:34:39,226 --> 01:34:41,386
And now this.

1431
01:34:41,466 --> 01:34:43,307
And...

1432
01:34:45,827 --> 01:34:48,227
you wanna know something?

1433
01:34:50,067 --> 01:34:51,868
I've had it.

1434
01:34:54,228 --> 01:34:58,228
I was anxious to get back
to being in a parish...

1435
01:34:58,348 --> 01:35:01,069
<i>- and coaching boxing for the C.Y.O.
- [All Murmuring]</i>

1436
01:35:01,149 --> 01:35:05,469
But lately, I've gotten kind of interested
in working with the deaf.

1437
01:35:05,589 --> 01:35:10,550
<i>Of course, not doing parish work,
I'll miss hearing confession.</i>

1438
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:13,430
But after listening
to you people for so long...

1439
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:16,470
<i>- I think I've just about heard it all.
- [All Laugh]</i>

1440
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:19,551
- I'm gonna stick with the army.
- I'd really like to live in Washington.

1441
01:35:19,671 --> 01:35:21,831
I'm gonna see if I can
work at Walter Reed.

1442
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:24,151
What about you, Winchester?

1443
01:35:27,192 --> 01:35:29,272
Well, I'm gonna be, uh...

1444
01:35:29,392 --> 01:35:32,312
head of thoracic surgery
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

1445
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:36,193
So my life will go on
pretty much as I expected.

1446
01:35:38,153 --> 01:35:41,113
With one exception.

1447
01:35:41,233 --> 01:35:45,674
For me, music was
always a refuge...

1448
01:35:45,794 --> 01:35:49,114
from this
miserable experience.

1449
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:52,995
And now it will
always be a reminder.

1450
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:57,635
So I'm going to
stay in nursing...

1451
01:35:57,715 --> 01:36:00,316
but I wanna be in maternity
or pediatrics.

1452
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:05,116
After all this, I think it would be nice to help
bring people into the world.

1453
01:36:05,196 --> 01:36:08,157
I wanna be an officer,
so I'm gonna try and get into O.C.S.

1454
01:36:08,277 --> 01:36:11,077
Then I'm gonna be the best darn
nurse Oklahoma's ever seen.

1455
01:36:11,197 --> 01:36:13,277
Well,
for the next few days...

1456
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:17,318
I'll be helping with the consolidation
of the 8063rd.

1457
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,598
And then after
a little furlough...

1458
01:36:19,718 --> 01:36:21,598
I'll be going on
to my next assignment.

1459
01:36:21,718 --> 01:36:23,638
- Tokyo, right?
- Wrong. Belgium.

1460
01:36:23,718 --> 01:36:26,279
You're both wrong.

1461
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:28,879
I've always looked
to my father for guidance.

1462
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:30,999
When he makes up his mind
about something...

1463
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:33,520
he does it no matter
what anybody says.

1464
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,440
And that's
what I'm gonna do.

1465
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,360
What I've wanted
to do all along...

1466
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,160
work in the states
in a hospital.

1467
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,481
[All Murmuring]

1468
01:36:42,601 --> 01:36:45,041
There's a lot of
my father in me.

1469
01:36:45,161 --> 01:36:50,842
It's never been his way to tell
people how he feels about them.

1470
01:36:50,922 --> 01:36:53,602
So I guess that's why...

1471
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:57,202
I never told
my nursing staff...

1472
01:36:57,322 --> 01:36:59,563
what I told other people
about you.

1473
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:05,803
<i>It's been an honor and a privilege
to have worked with you.</i>

1474
01:37:07,644 --> 01:37:09,644
And I'm very, very proud...

1475
01:37:09,764 --> 01:37:11,564
to have known you.

1476
01:37:12,804 --> 01:37:15,285
[All Murmuring]

1477
01:37:20,805 --> 01:37:24,046
I planned something,
but it kind of fell through.

1478
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:27,686
<i>- I guess you notice Soon-Lee isn't here tonight.
- [Woman] Yeah.</i>

1479
01:37:27,806 --> 01:37:31,366
It's because she had a lot of
things to take care of...

1480
01:37:31,446 --> 01:37:33,327
'cause we've decided
to get married.

1481
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:36,807
[All Chattering, Cheering]

1482
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:41,448
- Congratulations!
- I had to cut through a lot of red tape...

1483
01:37:41,528 --> 01:37:43,368
but I got permission.

1484
01:37:43,448 --> 01:37:46,968
The only problem is, she won't leave Korea
until she finds her family.

1485
01:37:47,088 --> 01:37:49,929
So... Boy, I don't believe
I'm sayin' this.

1486
01:37:50,009 --> 01:37:51,849
I'm stayin' in Korea.

1487
01:37:56,449 --> 01:37:59,050
You don't have to act crazy now.
We're all getting out.

1488
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:03,050
Here's how I figure it.

1489
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:06,011
If you love somebody,
you got nothin' but trouble.

1490
01:38:06,131 --> 01:38:08,011
So you either
stop lovin' em...

1491
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:10,011
or you love 'em
a whole lot more.

1492
01:38:10,131 --> 01:38:13,331
You know,
that's very profound.

1493
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:16,532
But the first thing I'm gonna do
is have a wedding ceremony with my family.

1494
01:38:16,652 --> 01:38:20,012
- I thought you weren't going back to Toledo.
- No, I mean with this family.

1495
01:38:20,092 --> 01:38:23,053
With you guys. We can do it tomorrow
before everybody goes.

1496
01:38:23,133 --> 01:38:25,533
[All Chattering, Cheering]

1497
01:38:25,653 --> 01:38:29,133
Colonel, would you
be our best man?

1498
01:38:29,213 --> 01:38:31,054
I'd be honored, son.

1499
01:38:33,174 --> 01:38:35,294
Here's to the happy couple.

1500
01:38:35,414 --> 01:38:38,894
May they have a long,
wonderful life...

1501
01:38:38,974 --> 01:38:41,255
filled with love and peace.

1502
01:38:41,335 --> 01:38:43,255
And so may we all.

1503
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:45,775
<i>- [All] Here, here.
- [Woman] Amen.</i>

1504
01:38:54,296 --> 01:38:58,817
<i>[Mulcahy] Because the best of marriages
are always founded on true friendship...</i>

1505
01:38:58,937 --> 01:39:03,577
and the fact that this is only
the first of two ceremonies...

1506
01:39:03,657 --> 01:39:06,178
is a symbol, I think,
of the respect...

1507
01:39:06,298 --> 01:39:10,578
that you have for your families
and for each other.

1508
01:39:10,698 --> 01:39:15,779
I hope you will cherish and hold on
to that respect throughout your lives.

I know you didn't mean it.

01:43:49,131 --> 01:43:52,492
Father, I saved you a spot next to
the ambulance driver. It's pullin' out.

1577
01:43:52,572 --> 01:43:56,972
And I got a jeep right over here
for Major Houlihan and Major Winchester.

1578
01:43:57,052 --> 01:43:58,892
You know, Father...

1579
01:43:58,972 --> 01:44:02,533
the first time I met you, I thought,
"Here's this nice decent guy.

1580
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:04,693
"Kind of sweet and gentle,
you know?

1581
01:44:04,773 --> 01:44:07,613
How's he ever gonna last
out here?"

1582
01:44:07,733 --> 01:44:11,574
I gotta tell you, you're just
about the toughest bird I know.

1583
01:44:11,654 --> 01:44:15,574
Well, I'm certainly a lot luckier than some
of the people we've seen come through here.

1584
01:44:15,654 --> 01:44:19,415
- Father, I'll see you at the 8063rd.
- Uh, what?

1585
01:44:19,495 --> 01:44:21,335
Well, good-bye, Father.

1586
01:44:21,415 --> 01:44:26,056
I must say, you have made
this hellhole a trifle less unbearable.

1587
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:27,976
It certainly is.

1588
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:31,656
What?
What?

1589
01:44:33,376 --> 01:44:35,497
So long, Francis.

1590
01:44:35,617 --> 01:44:37,777
You've been a godsend.

1591
01:44:37,857 --> 01:44:40,537
Well, look on
the bright side.

1592
01:44:40,617 --> 01:44:43,218
When they tell us we have to
do time in purgatory...

1593
01:44:43,298 --> 01:44:45,658
we can all say,
"No, thanks.

1594
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,378
I've done mine."

1595
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,338
Sherman.

1596
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:54,019
Father, I may never see you
again, and before you go...

1597
01:44:54,139 --> 01:44:56,939
there's something I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

1598
01:44:57,059 --> 01:44:59,620
- Your shirt's on backwards.
- Uh.

1599
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:03,020
- [Mouths Laughter]
- [Laughs]

1600
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,781
[Engine Starts]

1601
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:12,421
Good-bye, everybody.
I'll pray for you.

1602
01:45:22,902 --> 01:45:26,503
- Okay, Major, pile on.
- As what? A hood ornament?

1603
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:29,423
I'm sorry, Major.

1604
01:45:29,543 --> 01:45:32,864
The rest of this stuff can go on the truck.
I'll catch up with it.

1605
01:45:32,944 --> 01:45:35,744
No, Margaret. Margaret,
you stay with your belongings.

1606
01:45:35,824 --> 01:45:38,624
If you leave them with the army,
you'll never see them again.

1607
01:45:38,704 --> 01:45:40,584
You go ahead.
Go in the jeep.

1608
01:45:40,704 --> 01:45:44,225
I'm sure Sergeant Rizzo
will find me another mode.

1609
01:45:44,305 --> 01:45:49,065
<i>Well, I'll go take a look, but we ain't got
too many modes left, Major.</i>

1610
01:45:49,185 --> 01:45:53,426
Hmm. Actually, uh, Margaret,
I'm taking too many things myself.

1611
01:45:53,546 --> 01:45:57,306
I wonder if you would tuck
one more item in with you.

1612
01:46:07,948 --> 01:46:09,748
Thank you, Charles.

1613
01:46:09,868 --> 01:46:11,748
Thank you, Margaret.

1614
01:46:13,708 --> 01:46:17,669
<i>Hold on to that arm, Charles.
We want to kiss it too.</i>

1615
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:20,269
You take the arm.
I got dibs on what's left.

1616
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:27,630
- So long, Margaret.
- I hope someday I find someone like you.

1617
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:30,630
I hope so too.
You deserve the best.

1618
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:32,591
[Laughing]

1619
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:39,471
Good-bye, Margaret.

1620
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:41,912
I know you've got
your career in order...

1621
01:46:42,032 --> 01:46:44,112
but don't forget to have
a happy life too.

1622
01:46:45,712 --> 01:46:47,952
You're a dear, sweet man.

1623
01:46:48,032 --> 01:46:49,993
I'll never forget you.

1624
01:47:06,435 --> 01:47:08,315
So, uh, listen...

1625
01:47:09,395 --> 01:47:11,275
Yeah.

1626
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,520
- Well, so long.
- See you.

1627
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,521
[Engine Starts]

1628
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,282
<i>[Man]
Timber!</i>

1629
01:48:14,203 --> 01:48:16,923
How I wish I could
have swung the ax.

1630
01:48:17,043 --> 01:48:19,443
Just think of all the rats
who are homeless now.

1631
01:48:19,563 --> 01:48:21,724
Oh, don't worry. You'll find somewhere to go.
[Chuckles]

1632
01:48:21,844 --> 01:48:24,084
Excuse me, Major.
I got some transportation for you...

1633
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,004
but it ain't
exactly a sedan.

1634
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:29,764
- As long as it's got wheels.
- Oh, what a sport.

1635
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,965
So long, Major.

1636
01:48:33,085 --> 01:48:36,605
You can be proud of the work you've done here.
You're a fine surgeon.

1637
01:48:36,725 --> 01:48:39,126
Well, thank you, sir.
As are you.

1638
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:42,766
Shortly, I will be in a position of authority
over other surgeons...

1639
01:48:42,846 --> 01:48:46,206
and I hope I will be guided
by the memory of your wisdom...

1640
01:48:46,326 --> 01:48:48,127
and your gentle good humor.

1641
01:48:48,247 --> 01:48:51,207
Well, that's very
kind of you, Charles.

1642
01:48:53,287 --> 01:48:55,808
I'm sure you've got an even
bigger compliment for me, Charles...

1643
01:48:55,928 --> 01:48:59,048
- but let's not get gooey.
- I want to thank you both.

1644
01:48:59,168 --> 01:49:03,008
You have made me realize what
going home is all about.

1645
01:49:03,128 --> 01:49:06,969
<i>Major, I hope you don't mind
ridin'in a garbage truck...</i>

1646
01:49:07,049 --> 01:49:09,209
but it's the last
vehicle I got.

1647
01:49:09,289 --> 01:49:13,570
Not at all. What better way to
leave a garbage dump?

1648
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:16,530
Don't slip. There's gunk on
these runnin' boards.

1649
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:22,211
Gentlemen.

1650
01:49:32,572 --> 01:49:34,652
So, how are you gettin'
out of here, Colonel?

1651
01:49:34,772 --> 01:49:38,333
Oh, I've got my transportation
over yonder.

1652
01:49:38,453 --> 01:49:41,413
There's a jeep meeting me
at the orphanage.

1653
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:44,093
I'll take one last
ride on Sophie.

1654
01:49:44,173 --> 01:49:48,454
Then, at the padre's request,
I'm givin' her to the orphans.

1655
01:49:48,534 --> 01:49:52,334
They can use her for farming
and maybe take her for a ride now and then.

1656
01:49:52,454 --> 01:49:54,415
She's real good with kids.

1657
01:49:59,815 --> 01:50:04,456
<i>Well, boys, it would be hard to call
what we've been through fun...</i>

1658
01:50:04,576 --> 01:50:07,896
but I'm sure glad we went
through it together.

1659
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:12,817
You boys always managed to give me a good
laugh right when I needed it most.

1660
01:50:12,937 --> 01:50:17,017
Never forget the time you dropped
Winchester's drawers in the O.R.

1661
01:50:17,097 --> 01:50:20,418
Of course I had to pretend
I was mad at you, but...

1662
01:50:20,538 --> 01:50:24,938
inside I was laughin'
to beat all hell.

1663
01:50:26,098 --> 01:50:27,978
Yeah, I'm laughing
just thinking about it.

1664
01:50:28,099 --> 01:50:30,179
I love a good laugh
like this.

1665
01:50:30,259 --> 01:50:32,339
I better get out of here.

1666
01:50:35,299 --> 01:50:37,100
Colonel, before you go...

1667
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:40,380
We've been thinking about it, and there's
a little something we'd like to give you.

1668
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,700
It's not much,
but it comes from the heart.

1669
01:51:04,343 --> 01:51:06,183
<i>[Helicopter Engine Starts]</i>

1670
01:51:10,264 --> 01:51:13,024
- Sounds like my cab is here.
- Yeah.

1671
01:51:15,864 --> 01:51:19,105
- So...
- [Clears Throat]

1672
01:51:19,185 --> 01:51:21,345
Come on.
I'll give you a ride up there.

1673
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:12,151
Look, I know how tough it is
for you to say good-bye, so I'll say it.

1674
01:52:12,271 --> 01:52:14,591
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we will see each other again.

1675
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:16,591
But just in case we don't...

1676
01:52:17,792 --> 01:52:20,312
I want you to know how much
you've meant to me.

1677
01:52:24,032 --> 01:52:27,313
I'll never be able
to shake you.

1678
01:52:27,393 --> 01:52:31,593
Whenever I see a big pair of feet
or a cheesy mustache, I'll think of you.

1679
01:52:31,673 --> 01:52:34,834
Whenever I smell month-old socks,
I'll think of you.

1680
01:52:34,914 --> 01:52:38,234
And the next time somebody
nails my shoe to the floor.

1681
01:52:38,354 --> 01:52:42,194
And when somebody gives me
a martini that tastes like lighter fluid.

1682
01:52:45,595 --> 01:52:47,635
I'll miss you.

1683
01:52:47,715 --> 01:52:49,795
I'll miss you... a lot.

1684
01:52:51,716 --> 01:52:55,316
I can't imagine what this place would have
been like if I hadn't found you here.

1685
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,880
I'll see you back in the states.
I promise.

1686
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,400
But, just in case,
I left you a note.

1687
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,040
What?
