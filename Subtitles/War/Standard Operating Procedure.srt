1
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:23,100
It was a Charlie Foxtrot,
without a doubt.

2
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:27,000
Without a doubt.
I've never seen anything like it.

3
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:31,267
I never thought that I would
ever see American soldiers

4
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:35,501
so depressed
and morale so low,

5
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,634
and it was just unbelievable.
Everything about it.

6
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,701
<i>You got to consider</i>
<i>yourself dead.</i>

7
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:50,434
<i>And if you come back,
you're just a lucky bastard.</i>

8
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:54,834
<i>You know, but if you're there and
you consider yourself already dead,</i>

9
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:59,167
<i>you can do all the
shit you have to do.</i>

10
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:02,634
<i>I wouldn't recommend a
vacation to Iraq anytime soon.</i>

11
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:59,134
<i>JANIS KARPINSKI:</i>
<i>When Saddam's sons Uday</i>

12
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,868
<i>and Qusay were killed,</i>

13
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,067
<i>there was a great deal</i>
<i>of information seized.</i>

14
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,601
This was a key operation.

15
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,067
We no longer have to
worry about Uday and Qusay,

16
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:16,400
but we need to use this
information to find Saddam.

17
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:27,367
<i>After that big event,
the Secretary of Defense came to visit us.</i>

18
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:36,968
He wanted to see the prison.
He wanted to see the progress.

19
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,067
He wanted to...
Of course, every trip out there by anybody

20
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,968
included a trip to the torture
chambers and the hanging facility.

21
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,000
So we scheduled
different events.

22
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:50,501
<i>The first stop was
Saddam's hanging chambers.</i>

23
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,434
<i>We were preparing to
continue his walking tour</i>

24
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,801
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"No. I don't want to go anywhere else.</i>

25
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:06,968
<i>"Let some soldiers come over here
and we'll take some pictures.</i>

26
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:10,667
<i>"I don't need to see anything
else in the prison."</i>

27
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,434
<i>And then he left.</i>

28
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:17,667
<i>Enter General Miller,</i>

29
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:24,334
the guru of interrogation and
obtaining actionable intelligence.

30
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:30,667
And he arrives the day
after Rumsfeld's visit.

31
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:34,567
He was gonna "Gitmo-ize"
the operation.

32
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:36,434
Contract interrogators,

33
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,834
military people that had

34
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:40,667
experience in Afghanistan
or down at Guantanamo Bay,

35
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,367
they all arrived
after Miller's visit.

36
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:45,968
He gives an in-brief.
He's not afraid to say,

37
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,601
"You have to treat
the prisoners like dogs.

38
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:52,901
"They have to know
that you are in control."

39
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:56,434
Cell block 1A
transfers to the control

40
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,767
of the military intelligence
brigade commander, Colonel Pappas.

41
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,167
Cell block 1B,
several days later,

42
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:05,367
under the control of Colonel
Pappas and away from me.

43
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,133
They're going to use
those cells exclusively

44
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,868
for higher value
security detainees.

45
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:15,033
<i>Abu Ghraib</i>
<i>was becoming exactly</i>

46
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,000

he wanted to make it</i>

47
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,901

<i>I love you. Sabrina."</i>

64
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:56,767
We're coming up the road,
we see this huge structure.

65
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,033
It's like six
football fields.

66
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,501
Then we seen this sign saying like,
"Fallujah," right there, next town over.

67
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,934
We're like, "Yo, we right in
the heart of it right now."

68
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,501
We get inside,
it's nothing but rubble,

69
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:11,801
blown-up buildings
from shelling,

70
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:16,334
<i>dogs running all over</i>
<i>the place, burnt remains.</i>

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,868
<i>The stench was unbearable.</i>
<i>Urine, feces, body rot.</i>

72
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:28,934
<i>It was just disgusting.</i>
<i>You didn't want to touch anything.</i>

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,367
<i>And then we had to move
into prison cells ourselves.</i>

74
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,901
You're walking around in your compound.
Next thing you know,

75
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:45,667
(IMITATES MISSILE SOUND)
Boom.

76
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:48,033
Incoming. Everyone's yelling,
"Incoming." Like, boom,

77
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,667
"Incoming, incoming!"
You got to run.

78
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:54,667
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Goddamn, you're getting mad,

79
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:58,467
'cause it happens over and over
and over and over and over again.

80
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:01,434
After a while, the fear goes
away and you just get angry.

81
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,434
It's like, "Damn it,
can we shoot back?"

82
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:08,216
One pierced the roof of the
prison right to the floor,

83
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,567
but it didn't explode.

84
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,133
Boom! Ting-ting-ting.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,267
Land on the floor.
Soldiers in there are like, "Holy crap."

86
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,234
(EXPLOSION)

87
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,901
<i>Well, they ain't say, "Holy crap."
Now, you know what they said.</i>

88
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:32,334
<i>When you walk from the
main portion of the prison,</i>

89
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,501
<i>and you get to 1A1B,</i>

90
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,767
they already had intelligence
detainees down there.

91
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,901
That's when I saw
the nakedness.

92
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:42,420
I'm like, "Hey, Sarge,
why is everyone naked?"

93
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:42,934
You know.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,267
"Hey, that's the MI.
That's what the MI does.

95
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,834
"That's the MI thing.
I don't know."

96
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,868
"Why these guys have
on women's panties?"

97
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:53,400
He's like,
"This is to break them."

98
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,567
There's guys naked,
guys in women's panties,

99
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,100
guys, you know, handcuffed
in stress positions,

100
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:03,234
you know, in isolation
cells, no lights, no windows.

101
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,267
You open the door, turn the light on.
"Oh, my God, Allah."

102
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:11,634
Click, turn the light off, close the door.
It's like, "Whoa, what is that?"

103
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,767
It was like,
"Hey, that's Military Intelligence.

104
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,868
"You know, just
stay out their way."

105
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:18,701
And from then on, I was like,
"Something's not right here."

106
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,434
I was working out
of operations.

107
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,200
Some nights I'd get
off work at 10:00.

108
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,968
Some nights I'd be
working all night.

109
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,634
Depends on how many
prisoners we got in.

110
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,868
Sometimes we'd
get up to 200

111
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:35,534
that evening and I'd be there
till 6:00 the next morning,

112
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:39,067
and then I had guard duty at 6:00
a.m. and I'd get off guard duty,

113
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,300
get a couple hours sleep
and then go back to work.

114
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:49,801
<i>Usually I'd go over to the hard
site after my work day ended.</i>

115
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:52,467
<i>You know, it'd just be
Megan and Graner and Freddy,</i>

116
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:56,400
<i>maybe up in the office watching
a movie on his laptop.</i>

117
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,234
Some nights
I'd go up there

118
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,234
and there would be different people
in stress positions here and there

119
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,734
and got them up on
MRE boxes doing squats

120
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:13,467
or running up and down
the tier, or something.

121
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:22,167
We thought it was unusual,
and weird and wrong,

122
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:28,133
but when we first got there,
the example was already set.

123
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,968
That's what we saw.
I mean, it was okay.

124
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,801
The first thing
that I noticed were...

125
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:42,267
Was this guy.
He had underwear on his head

126
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:46,133
and he was handcuffed
backwards to a window.

127
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,434
And they were pretty much
asking him questions.

128
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,634
That's the first time
I started taking photos.

129
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:10,734
I wrote a letter home to Kelly,
who is my wife.

130
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:14,834
<i>HARMAN: "October 20th, 2003.</i>

131

<i>At first I had to laugh,</i>

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,801
<i>"so I went and grabbed a
camera and took a picture.</i>

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,334
<i>"Okay. That's funny.</i>
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

138
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:50,067
<i>"That's a form</i>
<i>of molestation.</i>

139
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:53,467
<i>"I took more pictures now</i>
<i>to record what's going on.</i>

140
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:58,734
<i>"Not many people know</i>
<i>this shit goes on.</i>

141
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,934
<i>"The only reason I want to be
there is to get the pictures</i>

142
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,434
<i>"to prove that the U.S.
is not what they think.</i>

143
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:10,367
<i>"But I don't know if I could take it mentally.
What if it was me in their shoes?</i>

144
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,267
<i>"I thought I could</i>
<i>handle anything.</i>

145
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:21,968
<i>"I was wrong."</i>

146
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,767
If I come up to you and I'm
like, "Hey, this is going on,"

147
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:31,434
you probably wouldn't believe me
unless I had something to show you.

148
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,267
So if I say, "Hey, this is going on.
Look, I have proof,"

149
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,300
you can't deny it.

150
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,033
(CAMERA CLICKING)

151
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:48,133
<i>Gus was the prisoner</i>
<i>with the leash.</i>

152
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,133
We thought he was maybe
part of the Iraqi army,

153
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,133
because he was always,
like, you know,

154
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,634
"Saddam's going to come back
and kill all of you. I hate you."

155
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,334
And all this stuff.
He had all this anger.

156
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,834
And so we thought he was
someone maybe pretty important.

157
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:06,901
And then we found out the history
of his arrest and why he was there.

158
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:10,434
And he had gotten drunk
and beat someone up.

159
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,267
He was just
a regular prisoner,

160
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,567
like we'd find at one of our
county jails, or something.

161
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,834
Once he came over to the
hard site, he stopped eating.

162
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:25,667
And we had to pump him, you
know, five to eight IV's a day

163
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:29,434
or bags of IV fluid a day
just to keep him alive.

164
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:34,934
Gus was being verbally threatening
and not following any directions.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,767
Graner put
the leash on him.

166
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:41,000
And then he crawled out
on his own after that.

167
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,167
And then he handed
the leash to Lynndie.

168
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,267
And that's when
he took the pictures.

169
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,501
And then the guy got up
on his own after that.

170
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,801
They were trying to say
that she was dragging him,

171
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,667
which never occurred.

172
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,467
I was there, and I
know it didn't happen.

173
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:01,667
It may have been unorthodox,
but he came out of the cell

174
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:07,400
and he didn't hurt anybody,
and he didn't get hurt.

175
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:11,767
Graner had the camera
in his cargo pocket.

176
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,100
And he asked me and Ambuhl
to come downstairs with him.

177
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,167
When he opened
the door,

178
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,634
Gus was in there,
he was naked.

179
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,002
He didn't want to stand up,

180
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:27,667
so that's why he brought
the tie-down strap.

181
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:33,734
So he put it around his neck.
So he's gonna make him crawl out.

182
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,267
And I guess he got about
halfway out of the door.

183
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:50,601
Graner told me to hold onto the
end of the tie-down strap, so I did.

184
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,767
I just grabbed it.
You can see the slack on it.

185
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:59,334
People said that
I dragged him,

186
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,701
but I never did.

187
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,067
(CAMERA WHIRRING)

188
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,300
<i>Graner took three</i>
<i>pictures back-to-back.</i>

189
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:17,267
You can see Megan
on the side standing.

190
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,000
He would've never had me standing
next to Gus if the camera wasn't there.

191
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:38,367
I'm a 95 to 100 pound
female, short female, at that,

192
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:43,000
holding a strap that's attached
to his neck. I'm dominating him.

193
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,767
Maybe that's what
Graner was going for.

194
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,934
Maybe it was for documentation,
maybe it was for his own amusement.

195
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,167
I don't know. I don't know
what was going through his head.

196
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,767
But he took it.

197
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,801
In all the years
as a cop,

198
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:02,434
I'd say over half of
all my cases were solved

199
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,734
because the criminal
did something stupid.

200
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,934
Taking photographs of these things
is that one something stupid.

201
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:16,434
<i>BRENT PACK:</i>
<i>They gave me 12 CDs</i>

202
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:19,234

210
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:41,234
<i>you wouldn't know</i>
<i>what the story was.</i>

211
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,200
<i>I started lining pictures
up based on subject matter.</i>

212
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>Put these on a time line</i>
<i>so that the jury could see</i>

213
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:53,267

<i>begin and when did it end.</i>

214
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,467
<i>How much time elapsed in

215
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,200
<i>How much actual effort</i>

216
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:05,734
<i>did these people put into what
they were doing to the prisoners.</i>

217
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,767
<i>Who else was there in the room
at the time that it occurred?</i>

218
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:19,901
<i>How could all this go on
without anybody noticing it?</i>

219
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,033
<i>When you look at this whole case
as one great, big media event,</i>

220
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,834
<i>you kind of lose focus.</i>

221
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:38,767
<i>These pictures actually depict
several separate incidents</i>

222
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:43,667
<i>of possible abuse or possible
standard operating procedure.</i>

223
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,033
All you could do is present
what you know to be factual.

224
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,567
You can't bring in emotion
or politics into the court.

225
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,267
<i>LYNNDIE ENGLAND: When I was</i>
<i>in the brig,</i>

226
00:17:57,334 --> 00:18:02,567
every single woman there was
in that brig because of a man.

227
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:07,601
Different reasons, yes,
but it was because of a man.

228
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:11,601
And when you join the military,
no matter what anybody says,

229
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:18,467
it's a man's world.

230
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:22,534
<i>You have to either equal a
man or be controlled by a man.</i>

231
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:29,167
<i>If you want to be their
equal, you got to be strong.</i>

232
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,267
They're going to
try to control you.

233
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:35,000
You need to step up and tell them,
you know, show them who's boss.

234
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:39,467
"I'm not gonna take that.
I'm not gonna let you power me.

235
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:43,033
"You know, control me because
I'm a woman and you're a man.

236
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,934
"It's not gonna happen."
Even though it's the military.

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,567
I mean, hell, if you're in
the military, you got a gun.

238
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:50,868
Use it.

239
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:59,000
If I would have thought about
that then, by God, I would have.

240
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,767
But I was blinded by
being in love with a man.

241
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:21,667
<i>Graner, he's</i>
<i>really charming.</i>

242
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:25,767
<i>If you didn't know him</i>
<i>and you just meet him,</i>

243
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,868
<i>you'd be drawn</i>
<i>in to him.</i>

244
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:34,300
<i>And in a crowded room,</i>
<i>he'd be the one to look at.</i>

245
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:37,767
<i>He would draw</i>
<i>the attention.</i>

246
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:41,067
<i>If the attention is not on him,
he'll get it there.</i>

247
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,868
<i>That's what he does.</i>
<i>He thrives on that.</i>

248
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,901
If you're not paying attention to him,
he'll make comments about you

249
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,801
and this and that,
you know.

250
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:58,267
Whatever you wanna hear,
he'll say it. And he knows.

251
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:01,972
He knew. And I was, what,
20 years old when I met him?

252
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:02,501
He was 34.

253
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,501
He had 14 years more
experience than I did.

254
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:10,901
So he knew what
to say, what to do.

255
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:15,934
<i>And I was dumb enough to fall for it.
I should have listened.</i>

256
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,019
<i>Everyone tried to tell me,</i>

257
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,200
<i>"He's too old for you.</i>
<i>He's a bad guy."</i>

258
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,300
<i>But I didn't</i>
<i>believe them</i>

259
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:28,767
because I believed him
for some reason.

260
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,334
Can't figure it out now.

261
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,801
The population was
just simply growing

262
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:23,634
but nobody really had a
plan on how you release

263
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,167
a formerly known as

264
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:29,100
"suspected terrorist" or an
"associate of a terrorist."

265
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:34,501
General Wojdakowski told me after
the first intake of prisoners

266
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,367
that this was going to
go on for several weeks

267
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:43,367
and at the end of it we might have
1500 or more security detainees

268
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,100
that we would be
responsible for.

269
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:46,611
And I said,

270
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:49,434
"Don't you think you should have
shared that information with me, sir?

271
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:52,067
"You know, I mean, we don't
have any resources to provide

272
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,801
"for the 200 prisoners in
the cells out at Abu Ghraib.

273
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:59,367
"And now you're going
to give us 1500 more.

274
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,000
"What's the release
procedures?"

275
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,071
He said, "You are not
to release anybody.

276
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:06,501
Do you understand me?

277
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:09,137
"If any one of these
prisoners gets released,

278
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,701
or ends up out on the street,

279
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,334
"I'm coming after you."

280
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,133
They would go out in
the middle of the night

281
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,901
and sweep up every single, you know,
fighting age male and lock them all up.

282
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,133
That's why you hear
the stories about

283
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,501
sons and fathers
and, you know, nephews

284
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,934
all getting locked up.
That's what they would do.

285
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,067
Imagine someone coming to your
town and taking all the men in it.

286
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:40,767
They would come in, like, on
cattle trucks, and just like cattle.

287
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:44,100
I mean, you come to the back door,
I mean, you hear a bang on the door

288
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:47,434
you know, bang, bang, bang, here
come the deuce and a half truck

289
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:52,067
full of scared
individuals coming to jail.

290
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,434
Were like,
"They come get me in middle of night.

291
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:58,200
"Mister, Mister, what, am I in trouble?
What I do? I'm not terrorist."

292
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:02,801
You know, they were like taxicab
drivers and welders and, like, bakers,

293
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:04,033
and they're at Abu Ghraib.

294
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:06,834
We had kids.

295
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:09,934
If we can't get the insurgent
leader, we took their kid.

296
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,534
"Akbar, I have your son.
Your son is in jail.

297
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,534
"Turn yourself in and
we'll let your son go."

298
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:19,033
I call that kidnapping.

299
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,067
It got filled up so fast

300
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,067
that we couldn't take
the children out anymore

301
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,901
and they had to stay
in their cells.

302
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:30,367
You feel bad for
them holding a child

303
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:33,567
for no reason just 'cause
of who your father was.

304
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,968
You can only make their stay a
little bit acceptable, I guess.

305
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,901
You give them all
the candy from the MREs

306
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:43,501
to make their time
go by better, I guess.

307
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:47,434
But there's only so much you
can do or so much you could feel.

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,968
<i>"They've been stripping</i>
<i>the fucked-up prisoners</i>

321
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,100
<i>"and handcuffing</i>
<i>them to the bars.</i>

322
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,834
<i>"I get to laugh at them</i>
<i>and throw corn at them.</i>

323
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:18,901
<i>"I kind of feel bad</i>
<i>for these guys</i>

324
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:23,434
<i>"even if they are accused</i>
<i>of killing U.S. soldiers.</i>

325
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:27,367
<i>"We degrade them but we don't
hit them, and that's a plus.</i>

326
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:36,701
<i>"They sleep one hour, stay up
for one hour then sleep one hour.</i>

327
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:40,033
<i>"This goes on for 72 hours</i>
<i>while we fuck with them.</i>

328
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:46,011
<i>"Most have been so scared</i>
<i>they piss on themselves.</i>

329
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:46,868
<i>It's sad.</i>

330
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:57,067
<i>"Pictures were taken,</i>
<i>you have to see them.</i>

331
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:02,701
<i>"A sandbag was put over their heads
while it was soaked in hot sauce.</i>

332
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:06,167
<i>"Okay, that's bad,</i>
<i>but these guys have info.</i>

333
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:12,133
<i>"We were trying to get them to talk.</i>
<i>That's all."</i>

334
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,634
<i>TIM DUGAN: The big word that always
comes up for me is "surreal".</i>

335
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:30,234
<i>Everything that you saw,</i>
<i>everything that was going on.</i>

336
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,767
A bunch of unprofessional schmucks
that didn't know their damn job.

337
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:37,767
All thrown together, mixed
up with a big-ass stick

338
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:42,367
and what you get out of it is the shit
you see on the news from Abu Ghraib.

339
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:46,033
It's disgusting.
Pisses me off.

340
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,133
Because the whole time
we're screwing around

341
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,901
and not doing the damn job,
Americans are dying.

342
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,601
<i>DUGAN: Abu G. had been</i>
<i>hit by a mortar barrage</i>

343
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,934
<i>killed two Americans</i>
<i>and wounded about 16.</i>

344
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:04,968
<i>We went to do an
interrogation on the Wolf,</i>

345
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:09,834
<i>the cell leader of that group of
people that mortared the prison.</i>

346
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,601
<i>There was two female</i>
<i>specialists,</i>

347
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:14,334
<i>one was an interrogator,</i>
<i>one's an analyst.</i>

348
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,534
<i>They took all of his clothes</i>
<i>off and got him totally naked,</i>

349
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,968
<i>which we weren't</i>
<i>supposed to do.</i>

350
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:32,367
When we got done with
the interrogation,

351
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:32,909
I'm like,

352
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,334
"So, what's the scoop
with the guy being naked?

353
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,868
"I mean, what's going on?"
Trying to think how they put it.

354
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,434
The Arab position
on the females,

355
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,734
they're a subservient
role in their culture.

356
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,567
And to try
and break that down

357
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:45,934
so they'll cooperate with
the female interrogator,

358
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,434
they interrogate him nude.

359
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:53,200
I went back and I asked
my section sergeant.

360
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:53,792
And he's like,

361
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:55,367
"Yeah, we're not really
supposed to do that

362
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:58,033
"but we let the females
do some things like that

363
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,801
"you know, to get over
the Arab culture thing."

364
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:01,455
And I'm like,

365
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:03,801
"You just said we weren't
supposed to be doing that."

366
00:28:03,868 --> 00:28:04,752
And he's like,

367
00:28:04,753 --> 00:28:08,100
"Well, they're allowed to
do it, but you can't do it."

368
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,100
I said,
"Okay. What am I supposed to do?"

369
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,300
And he's like,
"Well, you know,

370
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:15,100
"if I was you, I wouldn't be
around that kind of stuff."

371
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,267
It's not like they were
trying to hide anything.

372
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:26,367
And that's what
stands out to me

373
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:29,901
is if you know you're doing
something wrong, dead wrong

374
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,834
you're gonna hide it.

375
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:34,685
You're gonna do your
best to conceal it

376
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:37,400
so people that know
better don't see it.

377
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:42,400
As I walk in, here's a
guy in his black PT shorts

378
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,334
and T shirt
and shower shoes

379
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,200
and there's another guy off just
with his pants and his shirt.

380
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,300
Each one had
a naked detainee.

381
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:53,567
Someone says,
"We're MI. We know what we're doing."

382
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:56,300
And I'm like, "Okay."
You know, because I had no idea.

383
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,567
They're not wearing rank. I don't
know what rank these people are.

384
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:01,868
And they'll put their handcuffs above
their head, stretch them out that way,

385
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,801
you know,
stretch them out long.

386
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:07,434
Then they started handcuffing
them together. I'm like...

387
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,067
The whole time they're yelling,
"Confess. Confess. Confess.

388
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,534
"You know you did it.
Tell us what you did. Confess."

389
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,300
Then they start
handcuffing them into

390
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:18,033
what appeared to be
simulated sexual positions.

391
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,100
And, I'm just like. I thought
I had missed something.

392
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,234
Come to find out,
what's going on is,

393
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,601
these guys were accused of
raping a teenager inside the jail.

394
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:31,100
No military intelligence
value.

395
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,968
Cruz is yelling at him,
"Get undressed, get undressed!"

396
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,834
And the guy's like,
"No, mister, no."

397
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,367
<i>So after they're undressed, they
throw water down on the floor</i>

398
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:43,601
<i>and they make</i>
<i>them low crawl</i>

399
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:51,567
<i>making him try to drag his
genitals onto the concrete.</i>

400
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:54,434
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"What is going on here?"</i>

401
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:00,834
I said, "Is this the way
you all interrogate people?"

402
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,801
He goes, "There's a lots of
different ways we interrogate people."

403
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:11,567
<i>So I said,</i>
<i>"I've had enough," and I left.</i>

404
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,000
The next morning, the
lieutenant's right out back.

405
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:19,167
I said, "Sir, military
intelligence over at the hard site.

406
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,200
"They are doing some pretty weird
things with naked detainees."

407
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:25,934
He told me I had no
business being over there.

408
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,734
And he also told me, "Stay out of
MI's way and let them do their job."

409
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:37,000
ROMAN KROL: Okay.

410
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,868
Okay, on the right, in
black trunks, it's Cruz.

411
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,400
<i>Right next to him,</i>
<i>myself.</i>

412
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:54,701
<i>To the left</i>
<i>against the wall, Graner</i>

413
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:58,701
<i>and we're looking at the two
detainees handcuffed on the floor.</i>

414
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:05,200
Can't see anything
else, actually.

415
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:25,834
It was never intended
as an interrogation.

416
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,200
It was never
an interrogation.

417
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:34,334
The yelling was just
for show, I believe.

418
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,801
<i>To show the spectators this
would be done to anybody</i>

419
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:39,701
<i>who breaks the rules.</i>

420
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:56,200
Abu Ghraib was mortared almost
every day. People were dying there.

421
00:31:56,267 --> 00:32:00,367
So my frustration
level was really high.

422
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:05,067
And when I heard about detainees
that raped a little boy,

423
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:09,067
I just completely
went nuts.

424
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:12,534
Right before I left, I was so pissed
off that I had a bottle of water

425
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:16,100
and I splashed some of them just
to show, pretty much, my hate.

426
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:22,434
<i>KROL: At one point, there
was a Nerf ball brought in.</i>

427
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:26,000
<i>Everybody was throwing it</i>
<i>to each other, playing catch.</i>

428
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,100
<i>Here, I'm going to get it.</i>

429
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,968
<i>Once, I threw the ball, it hit
one of them in the leg, actually.</i>

430
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:41,367
<i>It's a Nerf ball,
so it can't bring any pain anyway.</i>

431
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,868
Graner wanted me
to take some pictures.

432
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,567
He didn't tell me which
ones to take or not to take.

433
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:57,968
So I was just walking
around, and...

434
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:00,467
"Just take one,"
you know?

435
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:04,501
MI came in and
they got involved.

436
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,968
They wanted to mess
with them, too.

437
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:10,601
They didn't like it that they
were raping the 15-year-old boy.

438
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:15,934
They were roughing them up, having
them run up and down the tier,

439
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,501
crawl, run into walls,
stuff like that.

440
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,234
And then they
handcuffed them together.

441
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:30,267
<i>That's Graner with his hands on his
hips and the gloves on his hands.</i>

442
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,567
<i>The two guys</i>
<i>in the background</i>

443
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:34,934
<i>are the MI guys.</i>

444
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,767
They didn't wanna be in
the pictures. They were mad.

445
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:43,501
But I was like, "Well, hey, you know,
don't tell me. Whatever.

446
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,501
"Just taking pictures."

447
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:52,767
I'm not gonna even
comment on picture taking.

448
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:56,234
The whole time I was there I
didn't see any pictures being taken.

449
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,200
Even though I was in a few of them
I didn't see a flash or anything.

450
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:05,367
Because if I did I would have
said something to these guys.

451
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:09,634
First of all, there's a big sign,
"No photography".

452
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:13,567
And besides photographing
something like that is just stupid.

453
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:23,434
I received a 10 month
sentence, a demotion to E1

454
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:26,033
and a bad conduct
discharge.

455
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,000
I was more humiliated by that
sentence than actually punished.

456
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,868
Eight months in jail for
pouring water on somebody,

457
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:41,834
and throwing a Nerf ball at somebody.
That's humiliating. People laugh at that.

458
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,734
<i>So I go back home</i>
<i>to my prison cell</i>

459
00:34:55,801 --> 00:35:00,167
<i>and I got one of the terps, interpreter,
sitting outside waiting on me.</i>

460
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:04,300
And he's like, "Mr. Dugan, I'm so pissed.
I'm just so pissed. I'm pissed off.

461
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:08,067
"The general that you guys did, he
wanted to tell us where Izzat was."

462
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,968
<i>Well, that's great.</i>

463
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:13,234
<i>And he's like, "No, the interrogator
wouldn't ask him where Izzat was."</i>

464
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,901
<i>He's the vice president of Iraq,
Saddam's number two guy.</i>

465
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:18,567
Ten times
the general said,

466
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:21,067
"I'll tell you where Izzat is.
I'll tell you where Izzat is."

467
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,234
And then he never
asked the question.

468
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,067
<i>HARMAN: He was standing just in
front of his cell at attention.</i>

469
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,968
<i>I mean, he wasn't</i>
<i>handcuffed or anything.</i>

470
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:42,667
<i>He was like a grandfather.</i>
<i>Very respectful.</i>

471
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:50,400
<i>They shaved his eyebrows for
some reason and he was so upset.</i>

472
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:57,334
<i>And I told him not to worry,
that it made him look younger.</i>

473
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,934
<i>I just felt really</i>
<i>bad for the guy.</i>

474
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:04,502
Four days later,

475
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:08,734
we were gonna do him and the
Army kid takes off the sandbag

476
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:10,167
and the dude
looks like Yoda.

477
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,834
I mean, he's got no eyebrows,
he's got no hair.

478
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,734
I'm like,
"Who the hell is that?" You know.

479
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:17,067
And he's like, "That's the
freaking general," you know.

480
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,501
And I'm like, "Bullshit." And I
thought he was playing a joke on me.

481
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,667
"Damn it, I don't
want this bullshit.

482
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:24,467
"I wanna do this guy, I wanna get this stuff.
I want to find out fricking Izzat."

483
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:28,100
He's like, "This is the fricking general,
I'm not kidding you."

484
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,334
Never got him.

485
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,801
That general wouldn't say
nothing else about it.

486
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:36,434
He had a serious resolve that he
wasn't gonna cooperate anymore.

487
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:44,501
We got promoted from
babysitters to condition-setters.

488
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:47,234
We got implemented
into the plan.

489
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,200
The military intelligence
people would come up there

490
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:52,300
and say, "Hey, play music
at this time. Play it loud.

491
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,501
"And if you got to, take the megaphone
and stick it right in front of the door.

492
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:58,834
"And turn it all the way
up so the guy can't pray,

493
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:03,100
"you know, he can't sleep.
Totally disorient him."

494
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,501
So I played this song
called <i>Hip-Hop Hooray</i>

495
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,634
over and over
and over again.

496
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:10,834
* Hip-hop hooray
Ho *

497
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:12,567
That's what
it sounded like.

498
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:14,133
After a while, the
Iraqis were saying...

499
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,400
* Hey, ho

500
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,334
This is not working.

501
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,701
So, I changed it and I
put on heavy metal music.

502
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:24,767
I put on Metallica.

503
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:27,200
Like, <i>Enter the Sandman,</i>
this very loud song.

504
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:29,200
Then they were screaming
like, "I don't like it."

505
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:32,734
But after a while it didn't...
They were numb to that.

506
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:36,534
I guess they were so deaf
from the guitar, the A chord

507
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:40,834
that they were able to,
you know, sleep. Go figure.

508
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:44,767
I put in country music.
That worked. They couldn't stand it.

509
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:48,767
They're like, "Oh my God, Allah. Allah."
You know, "Cut it off."

510
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:52,467
By the time the interrogators would
come to take them out the cells

511
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:56,000
they were more than ready to go.
Like, "Please take me."

512
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,968
Sometimes MI
would come in,

513
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,234
say, "Hey, we're gonna
interrogate this guy today.

514
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,167
"Get him out and you can start...
Soften him up a little bit."

515
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,634
Scream at him, yell
at him, make him do PT.

516
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,801
Handcuff him in a awkward
position for a while.

517
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,634
Completely strip him
and have a female do it

518
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:18,868
because that would embarrass the
person or humiliate them even more.

519
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:22,234
We didn't kill them.
We didn't cut their heads off.

520
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,434
We didn't shoot them.

521
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:30,367
We didn't cut them and
let them bleed to death.

522
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:33,534
We just did what we were told,
to soften them up for interrogation.

523
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:35,901
And we were told to do
anything short of killing them.

524
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:39,133
We would make them stand
in awkward positions

525
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,167
for hours at a time to stress
them out and to strain them.

526
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,734
And we would have them
crawl up and down the tier.

527
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:50,467
We'd pour
cold water on them.

528
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:54,067
Point at him and laugh at him
while he was in the shower naked.

529
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:56,400
Shower him with
all his clothes on.

530
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:00,334
Cut off all his clothes
with a knife.

531
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,901
Burn him
with a cigarette.

532
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:06,234
We'd just do what
they want us to do.

533
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,300
If they want us to PT
the guy that's what we do.

534
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:13,200
If they want us to keep him up,
that's what we do.

535
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,067
They say,
"I want him to be awake."

536
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:20,467
They say, "He's dirty.
I want him to shower a lot."

537
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,000
ERROL MORRIS: Did any
of this seem weird?

538
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:26,167
Not when you take into account
that we're being told

539
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:33,200
that that's helping to save lives
and you see that people are coming in

540
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:37,667
from right outside the wire
with their body parts missing

541
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:42,601
and they need to know who's
doing it so they can stop it.

542
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,133
And these are
your battle buddies.

543
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:50,000
Gilligan was the one on
the box with the wires.

544
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,901
He was accused of
killing two CID agents.

545
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:15,033
<i>It was his box. He had to hold it,
he had to stand on it.</i>

546
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,601
It was cold so
he had a blanket on.

547
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:24,734
I mean, he was never physically
ever touched that I saw.

548
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,067
He was just
very, very tired.

549
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,334
<i>HARMAN: He kept giving us different names,
 so Graner nicknamed him "Gilligan."</i>

550
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,968
<i>When I got there</i>
<i>he was in the shower.</i>

551
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,601
<i>There was wires</i>
<i>on his fingers</i>

552
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,167
<i>and he was told he would be</i>
<i>electrocuted if he fell off.</i>

553
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:01,300
<i>There was no electricity</i>
<i>going through the wires</i>

554
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:05,234
<i>and to say, "Hey, if you fall
off you're gonna be electrocuted."</i>

555
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,834
<i>I mean, that would keep anybody awake.
So, it was part of the sleep plan.</i>

556
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:15,901
<i>You had to</i>
<i>keep him awake.</i>

557
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:21,067
<i>It would have been meaner</i>
<i>if there was electricity</i>

558
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:23,701
<i>and he really could</i>
<i>be electrocuted.</i>

559
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,100
<i>It was just words.</i>

560
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,167
<i>The wires were taken off</i>
<i>after photos were taken.</i>

561
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:55,000
<i>You'll see Sergeant Frederick in it.</i>
<i>That's the one I took.</i>

562
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,767
<i>And the one where I'm
outside the shower looking in</i>

563
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:03,467
<i>I took that one.</i>

564
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:23,167
<i>He became one of our workers so
he was let out, like, every day.</i>

565
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:26,434
He was, like...
He's kind of fun.

566
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:29,067
But I think it was
proven he was innocent.

567
00:43:30,934 --> 00:43:33,434
We'd give him an extra
meal for helping out

568
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,334
and cigarettes,
that kind of stuff.

569
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,100
He was about
25. 24, 25.

570
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:41,534
Young guy.
Pretty decent.

571
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:52,868
<i>Each of the pictures</i>
<i>had file time stamps</i>

572
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:58,734
but they were all off anywhere
from a year plus to a couple hours.

573
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:02,434
And every time they got copied to
a CD from one computer to another,

574
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:05,033
the times would change based
on that computer's time setting.

575
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:10,701
<i>But the one time setting</i>
<i>that did stay constant</i>

576
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,801
<i>is what we call metadata.</i>

577
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:19,501
<i>Metadata's a big, two-dollar word
for information about information.</i>

578
00:44:21,634 --> 00:44:24,734
<i>Pictures have information</i>
<i>inside the file</i>

579
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:29,167
<i>that tells you about when
that file was created,</i>

580
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:34,501
<i>what software created it,</i>
<i>the exposure settings</i>

581
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,434
<i>and the date and time that
the camera thought it was</i>

582
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:40,033
<i>when it took the picture.</i>

583
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,968
<i>I was really elated to see that
the metadata was still intact.</i>

584
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:53,300
<i>The three main cameras belonged to Graner,
Harman and Frederick.</i>

585
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:59,667
<i>Graner's camera, the Sony FD Mavica,
that took most of the pictures.</i>

586
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:03,300
<i>There was a Sony Cybershot</i>
<i>I believe belonged to Harman.</i>

587
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,801
<i>And Deluxe Classic Cam,
which belonged to Frederick.</i>

588
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,934
<i>I then realized that these people
were actually taking pictures</i>

589
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,734
<i>of the exact same incident</i>
<i>almost at the exact same time.</i>

590
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:29,033
<i>Found a total of eight
separate time-synch incidents</i>

591
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,067
<i>where I could say, "This camera
thought it was this time.</i>

592
00:45:32,133 --> 00:45:34,734
<i>"This camera thought</i>
<i>it was that time."</i>

593
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:39,100
<i>Once I was able to adjust it,
all the pictures just seemed to line up.</i>

594
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:45,934
<i>There was a guard log</i>

595
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,734
<i>where they recorded incidences
that occurred at the jail.</i>

596
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:53,033
<i>It actually confirmed the
time line was accurate.</i>

597
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,734
<i>Sabrina Harman's camera</i>
<i>thought it was 2002.</i>

598
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:05,133
<i>I had to adjust her camera one year,
nine months, 11 hours, 29 minutes.</i>

599
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:10,968
<i>Frederick's and Graner's were
only seven or eight hours off.</i>

600
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:39,234
Nobody really got any intelligence there.
Very few of us.

601
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,234
Most of our interrogators were
18-year-old kids that are reservists.

602
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:50,000
And if you think about it,
you got a 45 to a 65-year-old

603
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,234
one, two, or three,
or four-star general

604
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,968
that you're gonna be
talking to.

605
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:57,467
And you're 18 years old, just got
out of high school, joined the Army

606
00:46:57,534 --> 00:46:59,534
and went through
interrogator school.

607
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:01,801
What the hell are you gonna
ask that 55-year-old general

608
00:47:01,868 --> 00:47:06,667
that's seen the world, done
everything and been everywhere?

609
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:09,434
You know, these kids
are intimidated as hell.

610
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:11,734
And the generals and the colonels
and these older guys know it.

611
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:14,133
And it's like,
they laugh at them.

612
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:22,300
<i>DUGAN: So I'm working this guy,
not getting crap out of him.</i>

613
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,567
<i>His brother was also captured with him.
So I went into the hallway</i>

614
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:31,334
<i>and decided I'd see what was
going on with his brother.</i>

615
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,734
<i>There's six interrogation booths,
and each one has a two-way mirror</i>

616
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:40,701
<i>so you can view what's going
on with the interrogation.</i>

617
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:45,667
<i>You got an Army female and
an Army male playing grab-ass</i>

618
00:47:45,734 --> 00:47:48,434
<i>and not asking</i>
<i>the detainee questions.</i>

619
00:47:48,501 --> 00:47:51,701
<i>There was a guy coming on to a girl
and a girl being receptive</i>

620
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:55,267
<i>when they're supposed to be
interrogating this schmuck.</i>

621
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:01,000
<i>And I said,
"Hey, why don't we, like, switch guys?"</i>

622
00:48:02,968 --> 00:48:06,667
So this new detainee's
in my booth and I say,

623
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:09,634
"Listen. I've been
sitting here for two hours,

624
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:11,234
"and I've actually been
sitting here for two days

625
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,200
"'cause I was standing
outside a two-way mirror

626
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,300
"watching you with
the other guys, okay?

627
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:17,000
"I know you know
all kinds of crap.

628
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:18,734
"And I know that you're
pulling a lot of bullshit

629
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:20,234
"on these Army kids."

630
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,334
I said, "I'm not gonna put
up with your bullshit, okay?

631
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,133
"It takes me three minutes and 47
seconds to smoke this cigarette.

632
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,968
"I'm gonna go outside, I'm
gonna smoke this cigarette,

633
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:31,968
"and when I come back in

634
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:35,200
"you're gonna tell me every damn
thing I wanna know. You understand me?"

635
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:37,801
I said, "Do I look like I'm
in the fricking Army to you?"

636
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:52,467
<i>And I put my fist through the plastic table
and I went outside to smoke my cigarette.</i>

637
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:57,067
<i>Then after about</i>
<i>a minute and a half,</i>

638
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,601
<i>there was crying and yelling
coming out of my booth.</i>

639
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:01,667
<i>And my terp was standing
near the doorway</i>

640
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,567
and he's like,
"You scared the shit out of this guy.

641
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:05,400
"He don't know
what you're gonna do.

642
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,834
"He'll tell you anything you want.
I mean, whatever you want to talk about."

643
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:11,200
So I walked back in there real
calm and I sat down in the corner

644
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:14,000
and I said, "So,
what's your decision?"

645
00:49:22,868 --> 00:49:25,200
<i>KARPINSKI: My prisons were
spread all over the place,</i>

646
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:29,133
<i>so I was on the road</i>
<i>quite a bit.</i>

647
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,734
One time I arrived down at Abu Ghraib
and Lieutenant Wood said to me,

648
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:38,934
"Oh, ma'am, we have an
interrogation going on.

649
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,234
"Would you like to
come over and see it?"

650
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,367
She took me over there and we stood
in the hallway and I observed it,

651
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:46,767
and it looked
perfectly normal.

652
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:49,767
I've wondered many times

653
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:55,100
if they didn't take me in there
specifically so I would be able to say,

654
00:49:55,167 --> 00:50:00,000
"Yes, I saw an interrogation, and,
yes, it looked perfectly normal."

655
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:07,200
It's kind of funny how when, say,
General Karpinski or some other big shot

656
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:14,300
would come look at the prison we'd...
You know, have a dog-and-pony show.

657
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:17,501
And everybody would get
their mattresses back.

658
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:19,701
Everybody would get
their clothes back.

659
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,200
And then as soon as
the people left,

660
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:27,267
whoever was deprived of certain
things got deprived of it again.

661
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:30,334
That just seemed normal to
deprive people of something

662
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,968
if they're not
cooperating with you.

663
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,334
<i>JAVAL DAVIS:</i>
<i>CIA, Iraqi Survey Group,</i>

664
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,934
<i>DIA, FBI,</i>

665
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:46,601
<i>Task Force 121,</i>

666
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:50,467
<i>the other government agencies,</i>
<i>that's what we called it, the OGA.</i>

667
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:52,834
<i>They had no rules.</i>

668
00:50:52,901 --> 00:50:54,501
<i>We called them the ghosts</i>
<i>'cause they'd come in,</i>

669
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:56,133
<i>you don't know</i>
<i>who they are.</i>

670
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,334
<i>Whoever their prisoners were,</i>
<i>you never logged them.</i>

671
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,501
"How's it going
there, soldier?

672
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:05,667
"You know, here's this guy,
don't log him in the book.

673
00:51:05,734 --> 00:51:08,634
"He's not here,
hasn't been here.

674
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,767
"Just put him in a cell in there
and, you know, don't mark it.

675
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:15,100
"When the Red Cross comes
here, move them another place.

676
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:17,367
"When the Red Cross
goes to the other place

677
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:21,300
"move them back to where they were.
You know, 'cause they don't exist here."

678
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:24,200
I'm used to being out
in the road, you know.

679
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:26,167
"Hey, soldiers,
go do this."

680
00:51:26,234 --> 00:51:29,834
"Roger that, sergeant, airborne.
See you later, we're done."

681
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:33,701
But now we're a part of this
big high-profile operation.

682
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:36,534
You know, we're getting,
like, the deck-of-card guys,

683
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:39,334
the guys who were on the deck
of cards. We're getting them.

684
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,000
Like, whoa,
we have a big job.

685
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,601
Wow, we got to guard
these guys now?

686
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,334
<i>JAVAL DAVIS:</i>
<i>That's when things changed.</i>

687
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,657
<i>They'd take them</i>
<i>into the shower room,</i>

688
00:52:09,658 --> 00:52:11,767
<i>put a sheet up over the door,</i>

689
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:15,167
<i>stick them underneath</i>
<i>the shower spigot.</i>

690
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:19,567
<i>Or stick them in the
garbage pails with the ice.</i>

691
00:52:19,634 --> 00:52:21,467
<i>Then have at it.</i>

692
00:52:31,334 --> 00:52:33,868
<i>A burlap sack</i>
<i>on their head</i>

693
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:39,067
<i>the wetness, it's sticking to your nose,
sticking to your mouth.</i>

694
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:42,100
<i>Makes them feel</i>
<i>like they're drowning.</i>

695
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:44,901
<i>Open a window while it's,
like, 40 degrees outside</i>

696
00:52:44,968 --> 00:52:47,801
<i>and watch them</i>
<i>disappear into themselves.</i>

697
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:57,634
For hours and hours and hours,
all you would hear is screaming, banging.

698
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:02,133
When they were done, eight, ten hours
later, they'd bring their guy out.

699
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:07,067
They'd be halfway
coherent or unconscious.

700
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:11,567
Put them back in their cell, and then,
"We'll be back for them tomorrow."

701
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:16,400
I know what it sounds like to hear,
you know, skin smacked or punched.

702
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:18,501
I know the difference
between someone screaming

703
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:20,067
because they're upset

704
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:22,734
and then someone screaming
because they're in pain.

705
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:25,167
You know, I know
the difference.

706
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:32,767
It was early
in the morning

707
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:37,534
like 4:30, around that time,
so everything was silent.

708
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:41,868
OGAs were, "Okay, we have
another special prisoner here."

709
00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:44,100
He was wearing
only a shirt.

710
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:48,734
So he came in,
he was shackled,

711
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:50,968
handcuffed and everything,
with a hood on.

712
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:54,234
When he came in,
we didn't ask,

713
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,501
we didn't ask nobody who
this guy was, what he did.

714
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,767
That wasn't our business.

715
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:06,100
<i>Two soldiers took him</i>
<i>straight to the shower</i>

716
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,234
<i>where he was</i>
<i>interrogated by one OGA.</i>

717
00:54:12,434 --> 00:54:13,767
<i>He was there</i>
<i>quite a while.</i>

718
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,033
<i>I think he was there</i>
<i>about an hour and a half.</i>

719
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:24,467
<i>All of a sudden, the OGA guy
opened the door and said,</i>

720
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:26,567
<i>"Can you help me here?</i>

721
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:30,834
"Tie him a little higher 'cause
he don't want to cooperate now.

722
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:33,200
"He's, I guess..."

723
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,901
You know,
he was just sagging.

724
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,167
There were some
CIA guys there.

725
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:42,367
I think they were CIA.
Well, yeah, they were.

726
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:47,334
But at the time, we didn't
know what agency they were with.

727
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,667
They asked us to handcuff him to the
window, so he has to hold himself up

728
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:55,834
'cause he was playing possum. Now
I'm just holding him by the jumpsuit.

729
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:59,868
I'm not holding him under
the arms or anything.

730
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:02,534
And his jumpsuit
is riding up his crotch

731
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:06,501
and I commented
and said, you know,

732
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:08,667
"Damn, this guy's pretty
good at playing possum."

733
00:55:08,734 --> 00:55:11,267
'Cause I know I'd be
howling like a, you know,

734
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:16,234
whatever with this riding up
my crotch like his jumpsuit was.

735
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,434
Everybody just kind of laughed and
nobody really thought anything of it.

736
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,667
And I remember how, like,
far back his arms were going

737
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:26,934
and it was just
a really awkward position.

738
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,534
Again, you know, I was like,
"You know, this guy's pretty damn good

739
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:35,467
"'cause, you know, his arms
are almost about to break.

740
00:55:35,534 --> 00:55:39,667
"I'm surprised they haven't broken.
I'm waiting for the pop."

741
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:42,300
And then all of a sudden,
just like, I guess,

742
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,067
blood started pouring out
of his nose and mouth.

743
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,400
And so we realized something
was, you know, was wrong.

744
00:55:49,467 --> 00:55:52,934
That's when I went
and raised the hood.

745
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,801
And that's the first time
I saw his face.

746
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:00,267
I was surprised 'cause his
face was totally messed up.

747
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:05,701
He got huge black eyes
with bruises everywhere.

748
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:09,234
And I was like,
"Whoa, what happened to this guy?"

749
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,367
And then one of
his eye was open.

750
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:18,634
So I kind of, like, did the thing
like Pierce so he could move his eyes.

751
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:21,434
And nothing.
He was just looking down like this.

752
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:26,334
And I was, "Whoa, this guy's...
This guy is not even alive."

753
00:56:35,968 --> 00:56:38,033
<i>This whole time we were
messing with this guy,</i>

754
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,267
<i>you know, carrying him</i>
<i>and lifting him</i>

755
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:44,000
<i>and this entire time</i>
<i>the guy was dead.</i>

756
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:54,634
<i>I even got some blood on my
uniform 'cause he was dripping.</i>

757
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,100
It kind of felt bad,
you know, 'cause I'm like,

758
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:03,834
I know I'm not part
of this, but, you know...

759
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:09,934
But it kind of make you feel like you
are 'cause you're there with the guy.

760
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,534
Colonel Jordan, he was
in charge of the MIs,

761
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:19,267
he came in, the medics came in,
Captain Reese came in

762
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:21,601
Captain Brinson,
the first sergeant,

763
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:23,467
Sergeant Snider,
everybody showed up.

764
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:26,634
You had the entire chain
of command right there,

765
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:28,033
trying to figure out
what was going on.

766
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:33,400
We checked him and, you know,
sure enough he had died.

767
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:38,267
(SIGHING)
And we kind of...

768
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:41,300
I don't know, I walked out of the room,
just kind of like, you know...

769
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:44,868
(HUMS) You know,
like nothing happened.

770
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:48,400
And then I asked
one of the CIA agents

771
00:57:48,467 --> 00:57:51,300
you know, I was like,
"Well, what do you guys normally do

772
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,634
"in a situation
like this?"

773
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:55,300
They were kind of,
not panicky

774
00:57:55,367 --> 00:58:00,434
but, you know, they were
on their phones calling

775
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:03,501
whoever, to see how to, you know,
see what to do or what not.

776
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:08,734
<i>JEFFREY FROST:</i>
<i>Well, what do we do with him?</i>

777
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:12,567
<i>We can't take him out in a body
bag 'cause that may start a riot.</i>

778
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:17,734
<i>So we had to keep him</i>
<i>there overnight.</i>

779
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:20,133
<i>And so we got</i>
<i>a body bag.</i>

780
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,734
<i>We got a bunch of ice.</i>
<i>Iced him down.</i>

781
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:28,434
<i>Left him in the room</i>
<i>where he was at.</i>

782
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:30,868
<i>And then we shut</i>
<i>and locked the door.</i>

783
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,334
I remember saying
to the NCO,

784
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,200
"You need to take the
spare key and hold on to it

785
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:59,834
"or someone will probably go in
there and, you know, mess with him."

786
00:58:59,901 --> 00:59:01,801
We should have
just taken both keys

787
00:59:01,868 --> 00:59:04,868
and held on to them instead
of leaving one there.

788
00:59:04,934 --> 00:59:07,300
But I guess he, you know,
had to leave one there

789
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:12,801
in case they wanted to come take
the body that night or something.

790
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:15,834
<i>FROST: It was pretty much supposed
to be, you know, hush-hush.</i>

791
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:18,567
<i>Didn't want the word</i>
<i>to spread around.</i>

792
00:59:24,734 --> 00:59:27,678
<i>HARMAN:</i>
<i>"It was a crazy day yesterday.</i>

793
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:29,567
<i>The guy they brought in died.</i>

794
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:34,267
<i>"He was beat pretty bad.</i>
<i>I'm not sure what happened.</i>

795
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:38,100
<i>"It was on the shift</i>
<i>before us.</i>

796
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:42,834
<i>"They stuck him in a room next
to where I was working last night</i>

797
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:48,200
<i>"and put him in a body bag</i>
<i>on ice. How fucking gross.</i>

798
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:57,334
<i>"He's already been</i>
<i>defrosting for 24 hours."</i>

799
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:04,033
Captain Brinson had a meeting in
the main office with all of us.

800
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,167
And he said that there was a
prisoner who had died in the shower

801
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:09,567
and he died
of a heart attack.

802
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:23,400
<i>HARMAN: Sergeant Frederick got the key,
and we just checked him out.</i>

803
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:36,367
<i>He started to melt,</i>
<i>and it started to smell.</i>

804
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:43,434
<i>He was there for at least 24
hours prior to us getting there.</i>

805
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:46,234
<i>So he was there for</i>
<i>a pretty long time.</i>

806
01:01:12,067 --> 01:01:17,000
<i>His knees were bruised,</i>
<i>his thighs were bruised by his genitals.</i>

807
01:01:17,067 --> 01:01:19,634
<i>He had restraint marks</i>
<i>on his wrists.</i>

808
01:01:23,067 --> 01:01:25,467
It was kind of obvious,
after you just kept looking

809
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:28,701
that there was no way
he died of a heart attack.

810
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:53,601
<i>MORRIS: You've gotten</i>
<i>into trouble because of the thumb.</i>

811
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:56,901
<i>HARMAN: I can understand.</i>
<i>It does look really bad.</i>

812
01:01:56,968 --> 01:02:01,834
<i>But whenever I would get into a photo,
I never know what to do with my hands.</i>

813
01:02:01,901 --> 01:02:04,267
Any kind of photo,
I probably have a thumbs-up,

814
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:09,033
'cause it's just something
that automatically happens.

815
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,267
Like when you get into a photo,
you wanna smile.

816
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:15,767
It's just, I guess,
something I did.

817
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:26,200
He was a ghost detainee,
so he wasn't supposed to be there.

818
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:29,033
They didn't want him to be in
there when the Red Cross came

819
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,667
so we had to
do something.

820
01:02:30,734 --> 01:02:36,434
So someone came up with the idea
to take him out of the body bag,

821
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:40,567
dress him in the orange jumpsuit,
put his dead body on a gurney,

822
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:47,968
stick a IV in his dead arm and
take him out of the facility.

823
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:52,000
<i>DAVIS: From that point on, we never
heard anything of it. It was just...</i>

824
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:56,534
<i>The guy died, they put him in a body bag,
put him on a gurney, he was gone.</i>

825
01:02:56,601 --> 01:03:01,367
<i>Go about your business, keep working.
Disappeared. He dissolved into thin air.</i>

826
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:02,868
<i>(DAVIS MAKES SWISHING SOUND)</i>

827
01:03:04,534 --> 01:03:08,100
They tried to charge me with
destruction of government property

828
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:09,834
which I don't understand

829
01:03:09,901 --> 01:03:14,234
and then maltreatment of
taking the photos of a dead guy.

830
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,801
But he's dead. I don't know
how that's maltreatment.

831
01:03:16,868 --> 01:03:18,801
And then altering evidence

832
01:03:18,868 --> 01:03:23,234
for removing the bandage from
his eye to take a photo of it

833
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,234
and then I placed it back.

834
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,000
When he died, they cleaned him all
up and then stuck the bandages on.

835
01:03:29,067 --> 01:03:32,300
So it's not really altering evidence.
They had already done that for me.

836
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:33,901
In order to make
the other charges stick,

837
01:03:33,968 --> 01:03:36,033
they were gonna have
to bring in the photos

838
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,934
which they didn't want to bring
up the dead guy at all, the OGA,

839
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,200
'cause obviously they covered up a murder
and that would just make them look bad.

840
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:48,801
So they dropped all the charges
pertaining to the OGA in the shower.

841
01:04:07,868 --> 01:04:11,267
Camp Ganci had a huge riot.

842
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,133
It was a female MP.

843
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,767
She got smashed in the face with, like,
a cinder block or something like that.

844
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:20,067
They were gonna break out
of the tent encampments,

845
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:22,200
get the MPs,
and hold them hostage.

846
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:25,000
We brought them down the hallway,
put them on the floor.

847
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:27,567
That's where I come in.

848
01:04:27,634 --> 01:04:29,567
I can't go
to sleep at night

849
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:32,868
worrying about the
detainees trying to kill me

850
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:35,334
when I got people outside
the walls trying to kill me.

851
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,367
This has got to stop.
These guys are gonna have to...

852
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:39,901
They got to know.
So I lost it.

853
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,234
Threw the guys on the floor,
I fell on the pile,

854
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,767
did like a WWF, you know,
just jumped on them a little bit.

855
01:04:48,834 --> 01:04:51,534
I wanted to do more,
I was mad.

856
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:54,200
I'm like, "You done hurt one of
our soldiers, like, that's it."

857
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,767
So I stepped on the finger,
stepped on the guy's finger,

858
01:04:56,834 --> 01:04:58,400
stepped on the guy's toe.

859
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:01,200
I wanted to hurt him,

860
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:03,334
the gentleman who hit the female
in the face with the brick.

861
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,968
I wanted to hurt
him really bad.

862
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,300
I finished my day
in the motor pool

863
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:11,200
and I had generator
detail that night.

864
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:16,133
Just sitting there at night,
it gets very boring.

865
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,300
Computer system
was very slow.

866
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:21,267
I was waiting for
e-mail to come up.

867
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,033
And Sergeant Frederick
walked in.

868
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,868
He had to print out
some papers and stuff.

869
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:27,767
And we started talking.
He got a call on the radio

870
01:05:27,834 --> 01:05:30,167
that he had some individuals
he had to in-process.

871
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:32,467
He said, "Come on, you walk down
to the holding cell with me."

872
01:05:32,534 --> 01:05:36,400
So I walked down with him. And they
had the seven individuals there.

873
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:38,400
And I said,
"Hey, Freddy,

874
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:42,667
"you want me to grab one of the
detainees and take him down for you?"

875
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:44,434
He said,
"Yeah, go ahead."

876
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:47,934
And as I'm getting closer to Tier 1 Alpha,
I could hear Graner yelling.

877
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,734
And I'm like,
"Where do you guys want him?"

878
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:52,601
They said,
"Just put him on the floor."

879
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:56,200
So I pushed him onto the
floor with the other guys.

880
01:05:56,267 --> 01:06:01,801
And that's when all the pictures
and stuff started happening.

881
01:06:01,868 --> 01:06:06,767
That's when Javal was stepping on
the fingers and stuff and on the toes,

882
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:08,901
and Lynndie was also.

883
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:10,601
And that's when all
the pictures started

884
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:15,334
and Graner asked me
to take the staged photo

885
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,968
of him with the one detainee where
he was cradling the detainee's head

886
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:22,501
and he was acting like he
was gonna strike the detainee.

887
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,400
<i>Never struck him.</i>

888
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:33,200
<i>As soon as I took the photograph,</i>
<i>he laid the detainee down.</i>

889
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:41,367
And then they start the
stripping of the detainees

890
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:45,834
and taking more
photographs.

891
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:49,567
Graner walks over to one of the detainees,
punches him in the temple,

892
01:06:49,634 --> 01:06:52,267
for what reason,
I don't know.

893
01:06:52,334 --> 01:06:55,701
I mean, hits
the detainee hard.

894
01:06:57,801 --> 01:07:02,033
And, after he does that,
Sabrina matches up the numbers,

895
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,834
says, "This guy's
in here for rape."

896
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:11,934
So Graner rips the leg open
on the jumpsuit that he had.

897
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,601
<i>Sabrina writes,</i>
<i>"I am a rapeist," on him.</i>

898
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,567
The guy hasn't moved for,
like, two or three minutes.

899
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:23,501
I kind of look
at him and I said,

900
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:27,434
"Hey, Grane, something's
wrong with that guy."

901
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,033
And I walked over and
I lifted the sandbag,

902
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,801
up to where
I could see his eyes.

903
01:07:32,868 --> 01:07:34,467
The guy was unconscious.

904
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:38,200
I said, "Graner, you knocked
that dude out."

905
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:41,167
And he kind of shook his...

906
01:07:41,234 --> 01:07:42,968
And after he punched him,
he kind of shook his hand

907
01:07:43,033 --> 01:07:45,667
and he said,
"Ouch! Damn, that hurt."

908
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,234
And he didn't seem
too concerned about it.

909
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:56,801
And then I walked back over by Freddy.
We were standing there.

910
01:07:56,868 --> 01:08:01,133
And Freddy looks at me and he says,
"Hey, watch this."

911
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,434
Goes over, gets the guy
that I escorted down,

912
01:08:06,234 --> 01:08:10,601
lifts the guy up, marks
an "X" on his chest

913
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,667
punches the guy right
square in the chest.

914
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:16,067
I'm like, "What?

915
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:22,667
"Who are you and what
did you do with Freddy?"

916
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,067
<i>Then they started the whole one
facing the wall on his knees</i>

917
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:33,901
<i>and setting the other
one on top of him.</i>

918
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,968
<i>They had flex-cuffs,</i>
<i>which are, more or less, big zip ties.</i>

919
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,300
<i>And I told Graner,</i>
<i>"This guy's gonna lose his hands</i>

920
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:51,801
<i>"if we don't get them</i>
<i>off of him. They're purple."</i>

921
01:08:51,868 --> 01:08:53,434
<i>I said, "Well, I got</i>
<i>my Gerber on me.</i>

922
01:08:53,501 --> 01:08:55,200
<i>"I can probably get</i>
<i>them with that,</i>

923
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:58,467
<i>"but we're gonna have</i>
<i>to stand him up."</i>

924
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,868
<i>It took a little while,</i>
<i>but I finally got them off of him</i>

925
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,100
<i>and then the blood started
flowing back in his hands.</i>

926
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:07,133
<i>And as far as I know,</i>
<i>the guy kept his hands.</i>

927
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:13,667
That's when Graner and Freddy
started with the human pyramid thing.

928
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:17,200
Graner told me that he
was doing what he was told

929
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,400
that's why
he was doing it.

930
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:25,868
And as I was leaving the tier that night,
I was told that I didn't see shit.

931
01:09:25,934 --> 01:09:31,534
And me being the person that I am,
I try to be friends with everybody.

932
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:34,934
I said, "See what?
I didn't see nothing."

933
01:09:37,133 --> 01:09:39,200
I was always
asked by CID,

934
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:45,100
"Why didn't you
report this?

935
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:46,834
"Didn't I feel that
it was morally wrong?"

936
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:50,334
I said, "Yes, but when
you're in war, things change."

937
01:09:52,534 --> 01:09:55,968
We were told,
"No pictures of prisoners."

938
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:59,434
I was asked to take it.
I'm a nice guy, so I took it.

939
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:03,734
I try not to have
anybody mad at me.

940
01:10:03,801 --> 01:10:05,234
That's the way
I've always been.

941
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:12,834
But I guess being a nice
guy doesn't always pay off.

942
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:20,400
Some people ask me now why I'm
not as nice as what I used to be.

943
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,801
I say, "Put yourself
in my shoes.

944
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:26,067
"Go through what I've went through
in the last two and half, three years.

945
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:28,167
"See how nice you'll be."

946
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:35,334
<i>HARMAN: Sivits just happened to
stick around for maybe five minutes.</i>

947
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:40,300
<i>I mean, he never</i>
<i>hurt anyone.</i>

948
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:51,501
<i>He got a year in jail for nothing.
Just for being there.</i>

949
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:58,634
<i>He shouldn't have</i>
<i>got any time at all.</i>

950
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:03,067
<i>I don't think he would've even been
charged if he wasn't in that video.</i>

951
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,801
MORRIS: Who took the video?

952
01:11:07,868 --> 01:11:08,901
I did.

953
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,934
The last thing I remember
was one guy standing

954
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,634
and one guy kneeling.

955
01:11:16,701 --> 01:11:21,167
And the one guy had his
hand on the other guy's head.

956
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:23,901
And that's the last
photo that I took.

957
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:29,300
<i>Then we left to go</i>
<i>use the phones.</i>

958
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:32,934
<i>It was Kelly's birthday,
so I went to make a phone call.</i>

959
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:41,334
Me and Megan were still
upstairs in the office.

960
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,434
And we walked out and they were
throwing them into a dogpile

961
01:11:47,267 --> 01:11:51,067
<i>and taking pictures</i>
<i>from the top tier.</i>

962
01:11:51,133 --> 01:11:53,601
<i>About that time,</i>
<i>Graner and Davis and Frederick</i>

963
01:11:53,667 --> 01:11:56,501
<i>started jumping</i>
<i>on the dogpile.</i>

964
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:59,467
<i>And that's when I went</i>
<i>downstairs with a camera.</i>

965
01:11:59,534 --> 01:12:02,734
<i>Graner said he wanted</i>
<i>some taken down there, too.</i>

966
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:08,901
<i>Me, Freddy and Sabrina</i>
<i>were taking pictures,</i>

967
01:12:08,968 --> 01:12:11,501
<i>three different cameras</i>
<i>that night.</i>

968
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:25,367
<i>They were lined up against the wall,
and Graner started taking them one by one.</i>

969
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:31,167
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>what he was doing.</i>

970
01:12:32,534 --> 01:12:35,901
<i>Nobody knew.</i>
<i>He didn't say anything.</i>

971
01:12:35,968 --> 01:12:39,534
<i>And then he told us that he
was piling them in a pyramid.</i>

972
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:43,934
<i>And we're like,</i>
<i>"Okay, why?"</i>

973
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,968
<i>He's like, "To control them,</i>
<i>so they're all in one area."</i>

974
01:12:49,601 --> 01:12:51,501
<i>So we're like, "Okay."</i>

975
01:13:54,033 --> 01:13:58,901
Freddy is the one that
started them masturbating.

976
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:00,467
I don't know why,
but he did.

977
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:02,334
He started the one

978
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,200
and then he wanted to see if the
others would do it too, I guess.

979
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:06,968
I don't know.

980
01:14:07,033 --> 01:14:08,968
But he had them all
doing it at the same time.

981
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:22,100
<i>At one point,</i>
<i>six of the guys stopped</i>

982
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:26,501
and the one guy kept doing
it for like 45 minutes.

983
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:29,767
No joke.

984
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:34,367
The one guy that was
still masturbating,

985
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:36,968
that was the one
picture with me in it.

986
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:38,934
He wanted me in it,
and I didn't want to be in it.

987
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,801
I was like,
"I'm not going over there."

988
01:14:40,868 --> 01:14:43,267
MORRIS: Who wanted you in it?

989
01:14:43,334 --> 01:14:44,834
Freddy.

990
01:14:44,901 --> 01:14:46,133
And then Graner
joined in.

991
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,868
Graner was like,
"Yeah, just come on."

992
01:14:47,934 --> 01:14:49,734
I was like,
"No, I don't want to go over there."

993
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:51,901
And he's like,
"Come on, just do it for me,"

994
01:14:51,968 --> 01:14:53,801
and this and that.
And I'm like, "Fine."

995
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,567
<i>MORRIS:</i>
<i>Was this your birthday?</i>

996
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,667
They brought them in after midnight.
So, yeah.

997
01:15:14,701 --> 01:15:16,434
MORRIS: Which birthday?

998
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:17,534
21st.

999
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:23,934
I had heard Graner saying,
"Well, this is your birthday present,"

1000
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,234
or something,
and I'm like...

1001
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,167
I don't know why
he would have said it

1002
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:33,534
'cause I really wouldn't
have wanted that, but, yeah.

1003
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:35,567
I mean, he used me.

1004
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:37,667
And even though I was
stupid enough to fall for it.

1005
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:40,467
I mean, now I'll know
what to look for.

1006
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:44,400
Least he's moved
on past me.

1007
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,234
<i>PACK: This was the infamous</i>
<i>seven-man naked-Iraqi stacking.</i>

1008
01:15:59,234 --> 01:16:01,501
<i>The facial expressions</i>
<i>kind of set the tone</i>

1009
01:16:01,567 --> 01:16:05,400
<i>for what they were thinking</i>
<i>and feeling at the time.</i>

1010
01:16:05,467 --> 01:16:09,934
<i>You look in their eyes, and it
looked like they're having fun.</i>

1011
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,634
<i>This scene is what</i>
<i>sealed their fate.</i>

1012
01:16:13,968 --> 01:16:15,834
Pretty much everybody
that participated

1013
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:18,567
is in the photograph
at one time or another.

1014
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:24,033
<i>Here you see Graner</i>
<i>in a punching motion.</i>

1015
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,701
<i>Two cameras actually caught
him at the exact same time</i>

1016
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:29,367
<i>from two totally</i>
<i>different angles.</i>

1017
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:35,234
<i>And again you see it where they
had the seven men stacked naked</i>

1018
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,667
<i>with the hoods</i>
<i>over their heads.</i>

1019
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:44,367
<i>You actually see both of the
cameras inside each of the pictures.</i>

1020
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,200
It's not so much that you're there
committing these acts of abuse.

1021
01:16:56,267 --> 01:16:58,467
If you're in the pictures
while this stuff was going on,

1022
01:16:58,534 --> 01:17:00,968
you were gonna
be in trouble.

1023
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,000
MORRIS: Big trouble.

1024
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:07,234
If you make our President apologize
to the world, I would say so, yeah.

1025
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:14,868
<i>HARMAN: "I haven't slept</i>
<i>all night. I just can't sleep.</i>

1026
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:17,400
<i>"Six prisoners</i>
<i>escaped last night.</i>

1027
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,767
<i>"That's eight we've lost</i>

1028
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:22,667
<i>"Something bad is going</i>

1029
01:17:22,734 --> 01:17:26,400
<i>"I hope I'm wrong,</i>
<i>but if not, know I love you.</i>

1030
01:17:29,267 --> 01:17:33,100
<i>"We might be under investigation.
There's talk about it.</i>

1031
01:17:37,934 --> 01:17:43,434
<i>"Yes, they do beat the prisoners.
I don't think it's right and never have.</i>

1032
01:17:43,501 --> 01:17:48,567
<i>"That's why I take the pictures
to prove the story I tell people.</i>

1033
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:55,567
<i>"No one would ever believe
the shit that goes on. No one.</i>

1034
01:17:57,567 --> 01:18:00,767
<i>"If I want to keep taking
pictures of these events,</i>

01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:03,367
<i>"I have to fake</i>

1037
01:18:14,434 --> 01:18:16,801
<i>"I love you. Sabrina."</i>

1038
01:18:21,434 --> 01:18:25,701
I guess reality hit that
what was going on wasn't right

1039
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,400
which, of course,
you know from the beginning,

1040
01:18:27,467 --> 01:18:32,601
but then it's your job.
I mean, there's really nothing.

1041
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,234
You can't just walk away and say,
"Hey, I'm not coming back,"

1042
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,968
or "I'm not doing this."

1043
01:18:37,033 --> 01:18:39,968
'Cause either way,
you're gonna get screwed.

1044
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:24,133
We had a Iraqi prison guard
smuggle in a pistol, a 9mm

1045
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,234
and a brand-new bayonet.

1046
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,200
The prison guard
wrapped it up in a sheet

1047
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:33,234
<i>shimmied it up to a cell.</i>

1048
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,534
<i>The detainee went underneath
his pillow, pulled out a 9mm,</i>

1049
01:19:39,834 --> 01:19:41,200
(GUNSHOTS)

1050
01:19:42,634 --> 01:19:44,968
<i>hit Sarge Cathcart</i>
<i>in the vest.</i>

1051
01:19:58,534 --> 01:20:01,467
<i>Sergeant Elliot had to</i>
<i>stick the shotgun inside</i>

1052
01:20:01,534 --> 01:20:05,534
<i>to get the guy to stop shooting.
And all he hit him in was the leg</i>

1053
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:10,734
<i>'cause he was in the corner praying, like,
"Allah, Allah." And he was willing to die.</i>

1054
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:39,467
<i>All the Iraqi prison guards</i>
<i>that were involved,</i>

1055
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:44,400
<i>they rounded them all up and fired some,
but the Iraqis hired them right back.</i>

1056
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:51,300
Not only did you have to risk your
life from the shelling on the outside,

1057
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:52,667
you was risking your life

1058
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:57,167
dealing with the unscreened
Iraqi corrections guards.

1059
01:20:57,234 --> 01:20:59,567
You know.
And the detainees.

1060
01:20:59,634 --> 01:21:03,968
So strike one, two and three.
One of them is going to take you out.

1061
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:09,033
Not all of them were bad,
but a vast majority were bad.

1062
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,033
The guy who smuggled
in the pistol,

1063
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,234
I thought was a good guy.
I thought was a good guard.

1064
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,968
He turned out
to be Fedayeen.

1065
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:18,300
Smile in your face,
stab you in the back.

1066
01:21:20,868 --> 01:21:23,801
They rushed in right away
and took care of this guy

1067
01:21:23,868 --> 01:21:26,934
who had just tried
to kill us. So...

1068
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,367
But it doesn't appear when you see
a picture that that's what happened.

1069
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:56,234
<i>AMBUHL GRANER: Your imagination can
run wild when you just see blood.</i>

1070
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:04,167
<i>The pictures only show you</i>
<i>a fraction of a second.</i>

1071
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:06,801
<i>You don't see forward</i>
<i>and you don't see backward.</i>

1072
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:09,234
<i>You don't see</i>
<i>outside the frame.</i>

1073
01:22:33,901 --> 01:22:37,734
<i>HARMAN: "This is the first time
I've seen military police dogs here.</i>

1074
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:42,667
<i>"Two dogs with two owners go
to the man against the wall.</i>

1075
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,601
<i>"The guy is scared out of his mind.</i>
<i>The dogs get closer.</i>

1076
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:54,501
<i>"The Iraqi starts screaming</i>
<i>and runs straight to Graner.</i>

1077
01:22:54,567 --> 01:23:00,667
<i>"And one of the guys lets his dog
loose enough to bite him in the leg.</i>

1078
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:04,534
<i>"The guy is hysterical.</i>
<i>The dog got another bite.</i>

1079
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:06,100
<i>"Blood was everywhere.</i>

1080
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:09,968
<i>"It was teeth marks that
looked something like this.</i>

1081
01:23:10,033 --> 01:23:14,767
<i>"One of our medics came, and he
taught me how to give stitches.</i>

1082
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:18,734
<i>"It was kind of fun,</i>
<i>but I felt horrible for this guy.</i>

1083
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,667
<i>"The dogs should've</i>
<i>never been there."</i>

1084
01:23:48,033 --> 01:23:49,834
One of the things an
interrogator does every time,

1085
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:51,934
it's the last paragraph
of all your reports,

1086
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,801
is you evaluate
the truthfulness

1087
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:55,067
and reliability
of the information

1088
01:23:55,133 --> 01:23:56,868
that was just given you.

1089
01:23:56,934 --> 01:23:59,734
That's the very last paragraph
of every report you ever write.

1090
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:05,801
So if I get information through
torture I have no way to verify anything

1091
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:08,968
because, well, I would just
assume that you're going to tell me

1092
01:24:09,033 --> 01:24:11,767
whatever the hell you
want so the pain stops.

1093
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:15,667
But if I give you some carrots
and I give you some reasons

1094
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:18,767
to cooperate with me,

1095
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:22,367
usually you're going to get
more righteous information.

1096
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:27,167
General Sanchez routinely
subjected Colonel Pappas

1097
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:31,234
to this finger pointing,
poking a finger in his chest

1098
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,067
and saying,
"I want Saddam. Find Saddam!

1099
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:37,834
"Find Saddam!
Do you understand me?

1100
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:42,501
"Find Saddam!
Find Saddam at whatever the cost."

1101
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:46,467
If you poke your finger in
somebody's chest long enough,

1102
01:24:46,534 --> 01:24:51,300
they'll do whatever they need to
do to get you to stop doing that.

1103
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:53,734
It's a downward spiral.

1104
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:58,701
"This isn't working.
Try this. This worked in Gitmo.

1105
01:24:58,767 --> 01:25:05,167
"This worked in Bagram.
Try this. It's okay."

1106
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:10,601
It doesn't stop the mortars,
doesn't get the information they want

1107
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,801
and it doesn't
find Saddam.

1108
01:25:14,467 --> 01:25:17,701
It wasn't any information they
obtained in any interrogation

1109
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:19,968
or interview out
at Abu Ghraib.

1110
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:23,400
It was soldiers on the
ground who found Saddam.

1111
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,067
<i>DUGAN: You ready for this?</i>
<i>The farm that Saddam was hiding on,</i>

1112
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:32,834
<i>a little tiny farm right
next to< the Tigris River.</i>

1113
01:25:32,901 --> 01:25:35,701
Saddam knocked
on the door,

1114
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:40,667
and he said, "I'm Saddam Hussein.
I'm the President of Iraq.

1115
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:44,334
"I am the leader of Iraq and all
the people of Iraq are my people.

1116
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,167
"All the homes in Iraq
are my homes."

1117
01:25:47,234 --> 01:25:50,901
And he went to the kitchen and
he made hisself a single egg

1118
01:25:53,334 --> 01:25:57,267
<i>and he ate the egg</i>
<i>and he left.</i>

1119
01:25:57,334 --> 01:25:59,834
<i>And he came back about</i>
<i>four hours later,</i>

1120
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:02,234
<i>and he's like,</i>
<i>"I'm staying here."</i>

1121
01:26:06,133 --> 01:26:08,667
<i>And the dude's wife,</i>
<i>like, freaked.</i>

1122
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:25,033
<i>Saddam was captured</i>
<i>on the 13th, Sunday morning.</i>

1123
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:29,200
<i>And then on Monday,</i>
<i>I had to report to Colonel Pappas' office.</i>

1124
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:33,601
<i>He asked if we wanted to volunteer
for a special projects team.</i>

1125
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:37,634
<i>He'd just got off the phone
with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.</i>

1126
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:40,601
<i>Rumsfeld and Sanchez had
authorized all approach techniques</i>

1127
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:44,000
<i>on the high value detainees.</i>

1128
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:46,567
They said we had the opportunity
to break the insurgency right then

1129
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:49,133
'cause of the stuff that
was captured with Saddam.

1130
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,534
And at that time
I believed it.

1131
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:14,067
<i>PACK: You have to look at
exactly what the pictures depict.</i>

1132
01:27:14,133 --> 01:27:19,200
It was important to separate
those that were criminal acts

1133
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,000
and those things that
were not criminal acts.

1134
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:25,234
And that's what the prosecution
would have to focus on.

1135
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:35,567
<i>If somebody was physically injured,
you know you have a criminal act.</i>

1136
01:27:42,601 --> 01:27:46,234
<i>Putting somebody into sexually
humiliating positions,</i>

1137
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,300
<i>you have a criminal act.</i>

1138
01:27:50,701 --> 01:27:54,634
<i>Making them abuse themselves sexually,
you have a criminal act.</i>

1139
01:27:58,234 --> 01:28:01,234
<i>Standing by and watching somebody
hit their head on the wall</i>

1140
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,934
<i>and taking photographs</i>
<i>at the time</i>

1141
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,501
<i>that's dereliction of duty,</i>
<i>so it's a criminal act.</i>

1142
01:28:14,934 --> 01:28:19,801
<i>The individual with the wires tied
to their hands and standing on a box,</i>

1143
01:28:19,868 --> 01:28:24,901
<i>I see that as somebody that's
being put into a stress position.</i>

1144
01:28:24,968 --> 01:28:26,467
<i>I'm looking at it,</i>
<i>thinking,</i>

1145
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:29,367
<i>"They don't look like they're
real electrical wires."</i>

1146
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:32,534
<i>Standard operating procedure.</i>
<i>That's all it is.</i>

1147
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:46,000
<i>Does this one actually constitute a crime
or is it standard operating procedure?</i>

1148
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:49,033
<i>That's probably</i>
<i>standard operating procedure.</i>

1149
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,634
<i>The panties on the head</i>
<i>are an added touch,</i>

1150
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:02,133
<i>but it's no more than</i>
<i>sleep deprivation.</i>

1151
01:29:03,534 --> 01:29:07,601
<i>They weren't being</i>
<i>tortured, per se.</i>

1152
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:12,200
<i>They were going through discomfort to
try to aid in obtaining information.</i>

1153
01:29:17,901 --> 01:29:23,100
<i>I've been in the Army for 20 years.
You know, I've been to Desert Storm One.</i>

1154
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:27,601
<i>I spent four months</i>
<i>at Guantanamo Bay.</i>

1155
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:29,868
People that haven't been
where I've been

1156
01:29:29,934 --> 01:29:33,501
I can't expect them to see
the pictures in the same way.

1157
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,834
I came back from a meeting,
it was very late at night.

1158
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,400
I opened my classified e-mail.

1159
01:30:08,467 --> 01:30:13,133
"Ma'am, just wanted to let
you know I'm going in to brief

1160
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:19,167
"the CG on the progress of the
investigation at Abu Ghraib.

1161
01:30:19,234 --> 01:30:24,501
"This involves the allegations
of abuse and the photographs."

1162
01:30:24,567 --> 01:30:26,601
And I sent an e-mail
back to him and I said,

1163
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:29,300
"I don't know what to say.
First I've heard of it."

1164
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,267
I was preparing in my mind to
hold a mini-press conference

1165
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:40,767
to tell the truth
and to tell it early.

1166
01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:43,667
To say, "This is what
we've uncovered.

1167
01:30:43,734 --> 01:30:49,334
"We're looking into it because
we discipline ourselves.

1168
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,634
"We're Americans, and we
know right from wrong."

1169
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:55,434
General Sanchez said,

1170
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:58,767
"No, absolutely not. You're not
to discuss this with anyone."

1171
01:31:01,334 --> 01:31:03,334
The fear of the truth

1172
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:09,234
silenced people.

1173
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,701
Everybody knew. Everybody
that was inside of that prison

1174
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:17,934
that stayed there, lived there,
worked there, they had the pictures.

1175
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,467
They would come over and they
would get copies from Graner.

1176
01:31:21,534 --> 01:31:24,267
And he had all these discs
so he would make copies.

1177
01:31:24,334 --> 01:31:27,300
"Well, here you go, here you go,
which ones do you want?"

1178
01:31:27,367 --> 01:31:32,300
Everybody had a copy of a picture.
Everybody knew.

1179
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,534
When those photographs came out,
the infamous photographs

1180
01:31:38,601 --> 01:31:45,000
the day after
Colonel Pappas issued

1181
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:48,100
a battalion-wide
amnesty period.

1182
01:31:50,067 --> 01:31:52,601
<i>Any type of evidence</i>
<i>was destroyed.</i>

1183
01:31:54,167 --> 01:31:56,868
<i>Burn it, throw it away,</i>
<i>erase it off your hard drive</i>

1184
01:31:56,934 --> 01:31:59,934
<i>and be done with it.</i>

1185
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,133
He just wiped out every
last single defense witness,

1186
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,200
every last single person

1187
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:08,834
that would've been
available to come forward

1188
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:13,634
and say, "Look, this is
what I know," in one day.

1189
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:16,033
You know, after
the amnesty period,

1190
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,767
who's gonna want
to come forward?

1191
01:32:17,834 --> 01:32:20,534
Who's gonna want to say,
"Hey, I know something.

1192
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:23,634
"I know what happened"?
No one.

1193
01:32:28,534 --> 01:32:32,334
<i>Find a way to make it go away
and that's what they did.</i>

1194
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:40,801
<i>Sacrifice the little guys,</i>
<i>that's how they cover it up.</i>

1195
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:58,801
<i>I'm a 28-year-old young</i>
<i>American. A volunteer soldier.</i>

1196
01:32:58,868 --> 01:33:01,667
<i>And I'm gonna get</i>
<i>everything blamed on me.</i>

1197
01:33:07,234 --> 01:33:12,868
<i>HARMAN: "Well, sweetie, you married a criminal.
Yep, the pictures are out</i>

1198
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:17,367
<i>"and I'm under investigation</i>
<i>as of 10 a.m. this morning.</i>

1199
01:33:17,434 --> 01:33:21,567
<i>"So much for turning those
pictures in when I come home.</i>

1200
01:33:21,634 --> 01:33:26,167
<i>"I knew I'd be in trouble</i>
<i>just by being there.</i>

1201
01:33:26,234 --> 01:33:30,167
<i>"But how else would you let people
know the shit the Army does?</i>

1202
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:39,667
<i>"You think I'd be scared,</i>
<i>but I'm not.</i>

1203
01:33:39,734 --> 01:33:43,267
<i>"I knew I'd go down with them.</i>
<i>Wrong place, wrong time.</i>

1204
01:33:45,901 --> 01:33:50,534
<i>"What sucks is almost the entire
company knows what happened,</i>

1205
01:33:50,601 --> 01:33:53,868
<i>"have seen the pictures</i>
<i>and have done nothing."</i>

1206
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:29,100
<i>AMBUHL GRANER: My husband</i>
<i>is in prison right now.</i>

1207
01:34:31,567 --> 01:34:35,267
I can't move on from this
until he comes home.

1208
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:39,801
So, that's pretty difficult.

1209
01:34:56,133 --> 01:35:01,868
This huge political monster
cost Lynndie England three years,

1210
01:35:01,934 --> 01:35:05,267
Ivan Frederick eight years
and my husband ten years.

1211
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:13,400
When I went through Desert Storm,
we were seen as the rescuers, the heroes.

1212
01:35:13,467 --> 01:35:18,534
Our mission was to reclaim Kuwait.
That was something that was honorable.

1213
01:35:18,601 --> 01:35:21,834
This war in Iraq,
like Vietnam,

1214
01:35:21,901 --> 01:35:26,267
will probably get remembered as
the one time that we not the heroes,

1215
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:28,734
we were not the saviors.

1216
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:32,100
And these photographs will
play a big part in that.

1217
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,934
War is a stressful
time for people.

1218
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,534
They were getting shelled on a
frequent basis at that prison.

1219
01:35:42,601 --> 01:35:45,300
A young person with no
experience in the world

1220
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:49,734
being thrown into something
like that may get confused.

1221
01:35:51,634 --> 01:35:54,267
We all say that
hindsight is 20-20.

1222
01:35:54,334 --> 01:35:59,767
And I'm sure they all look back
realizing what happened was wrong

1223
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:04,968
and they played a part in something that
was very embarrassing for the country.

1224
01:36:05,033 --> 01:36:07,767
But at the time,
they were in a war zone

1225
01:36:07,834 --> 01:36:12,167
where the rules
get fuzzy sometimes.

1226
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:18,200
Lynndie England,
I really feel sorry for that gal.

1227
01:36:18,267 --> 01:36:22,267
It's obvious she is one
of those young people

1228
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:24,634
that doesn't have much
experience in life.

1229
01:36:24,701 --> 01:36:26,534
There had been
no indication

1230
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:28,601
that she would have been
involved in anything like this.

1231
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:31,067
But she was in love.

1232
01:36:31,133 --> 01:36:34,834
Ambuhl. She...

1233
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:39,033
Well, she knew when
the line was drawn

1234
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:42,100
and when it was time
for her to disappear.

1235
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:44,234
Because she would be
present during some things

1236
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:47,133
and then noticeably
absent during others.

1237
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,801
Um...

1238
01:36:48,868 --> 01:36:51,367
So she was probably
one of the smarter ones.

1239
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:59,100
<i>ENGLAND: In the pictures that came
out in the media, all you seen was me.</i>

1240
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,200
<i>You didn't see Megan</i>

1241
01:37:02,267 --> 01:37:04,868
<i>'cause that was</i>
<i>the cropped picture.</i>

1242
01:37:07,434 --> 01:37:10,801
<i>Graner told me he just
wanted her out of the shot</i>

1243
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:19,901
'cause it was interfering with,
I don't know, his picture.

1244
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:25,234
Maybe it was to
secretly protect her

1245
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:29,267
because now that I know
that they were closer

1246
01:37:29,334 --> 01:37:33,901
than what I thought at the time,
maybe he was trying to protect her.

1247
01:37:36,534 --> 01:37:39,634
MORRIS: When did he find out
that you were pregnant?

1248
01:37:39,701 --> 01:37:42,601
Well, when I found out
on February 20th,

1249
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:45,200
I come back and I told
the First Sergeant Commander.

1250
01:37:45,267 --> 01:37:48,567
And, of course, they wanted
to know who the father was.

1251
01:37:48,634 --> 01:37:51,601
So they knew,
and then I told him.

1252
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:53,667
At first he sounded excited

1253
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:57,601
and then he was just like he
didn't want anything to do with me.

1254
01:37:57,667 --> 01:37:59,467
He didn't want anything
to do with the baby.

1255
01:37:59,534 --> 01:38:02,300
Once the story broke,

1256
01:38:02,367 --> 01:38:06,834
and it came out that I was pregnant,
he denied that the baby was his.

1257
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:10,534
He was accusing me of cheating
on him, which I never did.

1258
01:38:13,901 --> 01:38:18,167
So if that's how he wants to play it,
then that's fine with me.

1259
01:38:18,234 --> 01:38:20,033
He'll never see him.

1260
01:38:23,133 --> 01:38:24,767
It's his choice.

1261
01:38:29,767 --> 01:38:33,234
I was in the mess hall.
I look up

1262
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:37,934
and I saw myself
and Dan Rather

1263
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,767
and I'm like,
"What the hell?"

1264
01:38:39,834 --> 01:38:42,968
It's like, "Javal,
Sergeant Javal Davis."

1265
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:46,467
I'm like, "Whoa.
Yo, that's me.

1266
01:38:46,534 --> 01:38:49,167
"Where the hell did they
get this picture from?"

1267
01:38:49,234 --> 01:38:50,734
They went to my high school.

1268
01:38:50,801 --> 01:38:54,901
They acquired a picture
of me from the newspaper

1269
01:38:54,968 --> 01:38:58,133
when I was running track,
going over a hurdle.

1270
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:02,234
They cut my face out
and showed me like this.

1271
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:06,167
But, in actuality,
I was jumping over a hurdle.

1272
01:39:06,234 --> 01:39:09,634
So they made me look
like this mean-ass guy.

1273
01:39:09,701 --> 01:39:12,968
They're showing
naked people in a pyramid

1274
01:39:13,033 --> 01:39:15,033
and then they show
a picture of me.

1275
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:17,467
I'm like, "Hold on.
If you look at these pictures,

1276
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:20,434
"do you see a black guy anywhere
in any of these pictures?"

1277
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,934
There would be no me,
no no one else,

1278
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,501
no shock-the-world, no scandal,
if there wasn't any photographs.

1279
01:39:29,567 --> 01:39:32,300
It'd went away, it'd went
underneath a rock,

1280
01:39:32,367 --> 01:39:33,400
and that would have
been the end of it.

1281
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:44,834
<i>PACK: Photographs</i>
<i>are what they are.</i>

1282
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:47,634
<i>You can interpret</i>
<i>them differently,</i>

1283
01:39:47,701 --> 01:39:50,767
<i>but what the photograph</i>
<i>depicts is what it is.</i>

1284
01:39:56,167 --> 01:39:58,000
<i>You can put any kind</i>
<i>of meaning to it</i>

1285
01:39:58,067 --> 01:40:01,667
<i>but you're seeing what happened
at that snapshot in time.</i>

1286
01:40:08,334 --> 01:40:14,901
<i>You could read emotion on their
face and feelings in their eyes,</i>

1287
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:18,067
<i>but it's nothing that</i>
<i>can be entered into fact.</i>

1288
01:40:21,868 --> 01:40:25,000
All you can do is report
what's in the picture.

1289
01:40:27,267 --> 01:40:31,033
Somebody caught our administration
with their pants down. That's it.

1290
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:32,968
They're pissed off
at that.

1291
01:40:33,033 --> 01:40:34,801
You can kill people
off-camera.

1292
01:40:34,868 --> 01:40:37,501
You can shoot people. You can,
you know, blow their heads off.

1293
01:40:37,567 --> 01:40:39,801
As long as it's not
on camera, you're okay.

1294
01:40:39,868 --> 01:40:41,901
But if it's on camera,
you're done.

1295
01:40:43,567 --> 01:40:45,901
You know, torture didn't
happen in those photographs.

1296
01:40:45,968 --> 01:40:49,834
That was humiliation.
That was softening up.

1297
01:40:49,901 --> 01:40:52,033
Torture happened
during interrogations.

1298
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:55,467
Guys going through interrogation,
and they're dead,

1299
01:40:55,534 --> 01:40:57,701
and they were killed,
and they died.

1300
01:40:57,767 --> 01:41:00,567
That's where the torture happened.
We don't have photographs of that.

1301
01:41:14,167 --> 01:41:17,033
I just thought it was a bunch of
schmuck MPs acting like idiots.

1302
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,033
I don't think so
anymore, not at all.

1303
01:41:21,634 --> 01:41:24,334
I think you got a bunch
of kids getting shammed.

1304
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,834
It's just cover-ups and people
are afraid of culpability

1305
01:41:26,901 --> 01:41:32,367
and ramifications of their actions,
so there's nobody saying crap.

1306
01:41:32,434 --> 01:41:35,901
Except they're throwing a
lot of people under the bus.

1307
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:42,367
I received a phone call

1308
01:41:42,434 --> 01:41:48,634
from a Pentagon reporter who said,
"You were relieved from command."

1309
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:54,200
So I said, "I haven't
heard about it."

1310
01:41:54,267 --> 01:41:57,734
I didn't hear from General Helmly.
He didn't call me.

1311
01:41:57,801 --> 01:42:02,100
He didn't summon me to Washington D.C.
to be in front of his desk

1312
01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:04,133
so he could relieve me.

1313
01:42:06,033 --> 01:42:08,701
This is cowardice
of a different kind.

1314
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:14,067
You're afraid to look
Janis Karpinski in the eye?

1315
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:21,567
I got a letter 10 days
later from his office

1316
01:42:21,634 --> 01:42:25,000
relieving me from command
of the 800th MP brigade.

1317
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:33,734
My name was a good name in the
military until I did what I did.

1318
01:42:35,834 --> 01:42:41,667
My uncle died in Vietnam 13
years to the day till I was born.

1319
01:42:44,067 --> 01:42:49,067
My dad has two bronze stars
for valor from Vietnam.

1320
01:42:49,133 --> 01:42:52,267
My grandfather's got a
bronze star from Vietnam.

1321
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:58,400
And then I come along
and get involved in that.

1322
01:43:02,534 --> 01:43:05,934
That just put that
name in the mud.

1323
01:43:10,868 --> 01:43:13,067
You're taught from
the very beginning that

1324
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:16,100
you have to follow
your orders.

1325
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:19,300
And if you don't you're
gonna get in trouble.

1326
01:43:19,367 --> 01:43:22,901
And if you do,
obviously you end up in trouble.

1327
01:43:22,968 --> 01:43:27,467
You know, it's easy for retired
colonels and generals, and majors,

1328
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:28,934
or whatever to
stand there and say,

1329
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,133
"Well, these people should
have known illegal orders

1330
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:34,167
"and they should've stood up to
these lieutenant-colonels and majors.

1331
01:43:34,234 --> 01:43:36,901
"And they should-a stood up to
them at the time in a war zone

1332
01:43:36,968 --> 01:43:39,100
"where, you know,
lives were at stake."

1333
01:43:39,167 --> 01:43:42,934
And it's just kind of
unrealistic to think that...

1334
01:43:45,567 --> 01:43:47,234
That that would happen.

1335
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:53,601
You were getting shelled
every day, shot at every day.

1336
01:43:53,667 --> 01:43:57,734
Detainees, you know,
putting together shanks,

1337
01:43:57,801 --> 01:43:59,868
weapons, starting riots.

1338
01:44:01,167 --> 01:44:04,100
You know, this guy blew up,
like, 10 of my buddies.

1339
01:44:04,167 --> 01:44:06,100
He needs to get
his behind kicked.

1340
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:08,300
I know what I can do
and I know what I...

1341
01:44:08,367 --> 01:44:10,567
And I think I know
what I can't do.

1342
01:44:10,634 --> 01:44:14,133
I think I know what I can't do,
but I see these guys doing this

1343
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:17,133
and I see, you know,
the CIA guys coming and doing this.

1344
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,601
You know, after a while
it's like, "You know what?

1345
01:44:19,667 --> 01:44:22,334
"It's free reign,
just don't kill them."

1346
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:26,801
I was not the same person there
that I am sitting in this chair

1347
01:44:26,868 --> 01:44:29,667
or that I was
before I got there.

1348
01:44:31,968 --> 01:44:34,934
I don't know what I
could've done different.

1349
01:44:36,601 --> 01:44:38,767
I could've said,
"Screw you, I'm not working here"

1350
01:44:38,834 --> 01:44:42,501
and just gone to jail for
disobeying an order, I guess.

1351
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:45,300
But, I don't know.

1352
01:44:48,634 --> 01:44:51,367
I'm sure everybody can do
something different put in...

1353
01:44:51,434 --> 01:44:53,667
I just don't know what I
would've done different,

1354
01:44:53,734 --> 01:44:57,133
put in the same
situation.

1355
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,868
If I could back all the way up,
I wouldn't have joined the military.

1356
01:45:00,934 --> 01:45:03,701
That's what I would
have done different.

1357
01:45:05,234 --> 01:45:07,167
It's just not worth it.

1358
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:10,634
You go through all that
trouble to start back

1359
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:13,334
where you were
when you first went in.

1360
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,234
Trying to get in school,
trying to get...

1361
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:21,167
It just wasn't worth it.

1362
01:45:24,534 --> 01:45:26,868
I just want to
go on with life.

1363
01:45:28,501 --> 01:45:31,734
You know, get a job,
raise my son.

1364
01:45:34,767 --> 01:45:37,434
I don't think
I have a lot of choices.

1365
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:42,501
Can't change anything, so...

1366
01:45:45,234 --> 01:45:48,100
And if I did, then
I wouldn't have Carter.

1367
01:45:50,133 --> 01:45:54,133
I mean, I wouldn't trade him
for the world, so...

1368
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:57,334
I wouldn't want to go
back and change anything.

1369
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:04,007
It's how the world turns,
ain't it?

1370
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,534
People backstabbing
other people.

1371
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:12,934
Unfairness.
It's drama. It's life.

1372
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,300
You live it.
Now I just got to move on.

1373
01:51:15,301 --> 01:51:16,301
