00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,510
Dear hussars and ISAF Team 7.
This is it.

2
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,073
Is the task important?
Is it still relevant for us Danes?

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,155
These are obvious questions
that you may be asking yourselves.

4
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,915
Your predecessors
in Helmand have pushed forward -

5
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,993
- and made a huge effort
in aid of a civilian population -

6
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,789
- that has lived
under miserable conditions.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,478
For this, several of our colleagues
have paid a high price.

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,519
It's your duty to continue
unhesitatingly in their footsteps -

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,196
- now that your government has
charted its political course.

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,116
- Yes.
- When are you going to Jutland?

11
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,718
To Jutland?
That will be on ... Thursday.

12
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,708
- And the exercise will last for ...?
- Ten days.

13
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,192
That's it, I think.

14
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,150
It hasn't really dawned upon me
that you're actually going.

15
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,711
It doesn't strike you
until the goodbyes.

16
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,831
I've spent months trying to figure it
out, and I gave up. I just don't get it.

17
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,037
You could say it's like football.

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,034
You learn so and so much
through practice -

19
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,354
- but you learn more
by playing matches.

20
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,232
- You also enjoy the comradeship.
- Of course. That's part of it.

21
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,873
- It's a challenge and an adventure ...
- And that's what hurts!

22
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,160
- An adventure? I can't ...
- But I want the experience.

23
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,435
What's up?
Did you get home, or what?

24
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,399
No ...
I'm here now.

25
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,115
Thanks for calling.
Bye.

26
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,352
What a trendy hairstyle, Kim!
Not bad at all.

27
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,790
- Is that our own logo?
- No. It says "Spearhead."

28
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,275
The Asian guy with the T-shirt ...

29
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,750
- He's the medic in my group.
- Okay?

30
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,754
- What does he do?
- Patches us up, if necessary.

31
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,870
- Does he go on patrol with you?
- Oh, I see. Yes, he does.

32
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,674
- I think I'll head upstairs.
- Okay.

33
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,752
See you, Mom.

34
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,994
- Goodbye.
- Behave yourself.

35
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,629
I want you to make sure -

36
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,999
- that you pay attention
to your surroundings.

37
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,914
Even if you think
it's safe and sound.

38
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,631
Forget about yourself
and what you look like.

39
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,199
- I'm going to miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

40
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,920
- I love you.
- I know.

41
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,958
- See you.
- Take care.

42
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,758
See you.

43
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,354
Bye, Dad.

44
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,513
- See you.
- I'll hold you to that, Mads.

45
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,116
- Promise?
- I promise.

46
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,953
Welcome. Welcome.

47
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,159
- Did you have a good trip?
- It was a bit long.

48
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,788
We haven't been bored
in Armadillo.

49
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,916
400 shells were fired yesterday.

50
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,514
- It was fairly ...
- 400?

51
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,909
A Taliban mortar fired on us,
and we sent off 260120 mm -

52
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,032
- and 120105 mm.

53
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,239
Air support and Apaches
were called in. It wasn't boring.

54
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,235
The Taliban are much more
on their toes than I had thought.

55
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,839
They are just 800m away
from Armadillo and on the ball.

56
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,678
- So we'll confront them fairly soon.
- It's good there's work for us.

57
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,234
You can count on some action.
I promise it'll be interesting.

58
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,556
Six months without women.

59
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,315
- You're awfully cheerful.
- After a long night.

60
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,157
- You have M&Ms?
- Hands off. It's my dinner.

61
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,357
- Your dinner?
- What's your problem?

62
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,557
Mini wears size 3 in jackets.

63
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,679
Is that why his helmet says
"King of the Green Zone"?

64
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,315
Welcome. Grab some water.
I have a few pointers.

65
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,076
Gun line is shooting.
That's why it's so noisy.

66
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,950
If you hear what sounds like a
rocket, it's the launchers firing.

67
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,192
It's fired at any time of the day.

68
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,670
There was one. That's normal.

69
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,513
Here are the shower containers.

70
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,036
That's the Green Zone.
Observe as much as possible.

71
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,510
When there's combat,
you're obviously more exposed -

72
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,513
- so don't just stand there staring.

73
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,071
"Walk-ins" stop just over there
and call for an interpreter.

74
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,233
It doesn't take long to figure out
if they're dicking around -

75
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,630
- or if it's something useful.

76
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,632
- You had some questions.
- Yes.

77
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,033
How far north
from Armadillo can we go -

78
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,033
- before the Taliban get active?

79
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,715
About 800-1000m
north of Armadillo.

80
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,317
From up here we can draw a line
almost up to the Helmand River.

81
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,632
This area here is basically ours.

82
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,112
His objective is to move south
and isolate us so we can't get out -

83
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,877
- and to diminish our influence on
the locals. That's what he wants to do.

84
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,116
Our patrolling forces him to meet us
here and fight in this narrow pass.

85
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,035
These people are former mujahedeen
and used to fight the Russians -

86
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,309
- in the exact same area, so they're
used to fighting a superior force.

87
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,235
They're not afraid.
Ten men might attack forty.

88
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,916
Being outnumbered doesn't
stop them. Not at all.

89
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,958
- They've got big balls
- That's for sure.

90
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,478
Did you treat the ones who were killed
and wounded in December?

91
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,034
Unfortunately me and J were the ones
who found the dead on 12-19.

92
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,751
We were first on the spot. I grabbed
a detector and started sweeping.

93
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,553
As we went around the vehicle, the
fucking beam from my headlamp -

94
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,590
- caught this guy right in his face.
He was staring, but dead, of course.

95
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,673
I closed his eyes
and covered up his face.

96
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,877
And the last guy ...
There wasn't much left of him.

97
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,113
I collected body parts for six hours.
Everything.

98
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,031
Fingers, a hand in a glove,
a knee joint, a heart lying around ...

99
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,113
It's hard to describe what
it looks like in a place like that.

100
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,272
You also have to
keep an eye on yourself.

101
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,639
You're not wacko, just because
you laugh at some irrelevant stuff.

102
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,749
You need normality, 'cause this is so
meaningless that you can't grasp it.

103
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,513
- <i>Susanne speaking.</i>
- Hi, it's Mads.

104
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,151
Hi, Mads.
I was hoping it was you.

105
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,632
- How are you?
- <i>Fine, How about you?</i>

106
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,598
That's much more interesting.

107
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,880
- I'm fine. We're in Armadillo.
- <i>Okay.</i>

108
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,273
- What's Dad up to?
- <i>He sitting right here.</i>

109
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,796
I'll let you talk to him.

110
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,959
- <i>Hi, Mads.</i>
- Hi, Dad. How are you?

111
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,759
We're fine, Mads.

112
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,234
But yesterday
your mother had a fright -

113
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,110
- when the phone rang
in the middle of the night.

114
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,958
I didn't hear it, but she did.
It scared the daylights out of her.

115
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,911
Your first thought is that
something terrible has happened.

116
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,792
But it was a business call from India
about something they're printing -

117
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,509
- and they forgot
about the time difference.

118
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,789
Since we left Denmark,
the enemy's objective hasn't changed.

119
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,114
The Taliban's objective is
to destabilize security in Helmand -

120
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,512
- and undermine the locals' trust
in the ISAF forces.

121
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,354
It's important to get
into Haftaran and Athakhan -

122
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,753
- to establish contact with the people.
When you eat your field rations -

123
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,435
- and there's something
you don't like -

124
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,990
- I suggest you save it
and bring it on patrol.

125
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,473
Give it to the children
as a sign of good will.

126
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,038
Rules of engagement.

127
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,988
Remember that self defense
can apply prior to being fired upon.

128
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,633
Such as by confirmed weapons or
people moving into a position to fire.

129
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,438
Yes. Go get ready.

130
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,790
Listen up. Line up, so 6-5 can take
our picture before our first patrol.

131
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,078
I don't have anything.

132
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,190
I can see why the Wadis
are dangerous.

133
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,310
They can easily hide an IED.
The thought is sickening.

134
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,429
We're most likely to go around it -

135
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,558
- so it would be stupid
to put one here.

136
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,673
905, I saw a man run through
the fence on the eastern side -

137
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,837
- of the row of bushes
that run from north to south.

138
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,708
Welcome to Nam.

139
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,632
- Hey, interpreter!
- Follow me. Come.

140
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,396
Hayatullah, hurry.
Don't let them onto the poppy field.

141
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,874
This way. Not in the field.
I will show you.

142
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,759
9-0 here. Civilians are showing us
the route around the field.

143
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,068
Salaam aleikum.

144
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,028
How are you? Alright?

145
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,716
- Read your book.
- Are you reading? Yes.

146
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,479
- It's a madrassa.
- Are you studying the Koran?

147
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,269
- Have things been calm?
- How is the situation in the area?

148
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,479
- Calm?
- No, where is it safe?

149
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,431
- Are the Taliban in the area?
- They've taken the whole area.

150
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,672
How could you not know?
They're everywhere.

151
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,957
Tell us if you see anything.

152
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,351
So we can get them out
of the area.

153
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,114
We cannot cooperate with you.

154
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,751
You come with all your weapons,
and then you leave.

155
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,833
We're staying here, and then the
Taliban will come after us.

156
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,198
But if you don't cooperate,
we cannot secure the area -

157
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,909
- and then we can't build
a school for your kids.

158
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,234
You have guns, they have guns.
If I talk, they'll cut my throat.

159
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,159
- First patrol reporting!
- Look at my back!

160
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,639
Look cool, man!

161
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,110
Just a sec.

162
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,878
First patrol reporting.

163
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,272
It didn't feel like anything.
Not really.

164
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,635
I probably will,
when we get into the shooting.

165
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,237
But this is also part of it.
It's not all fighting.

166
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,951
Right, we're also here
to help these poor people.

167
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,989
It's like going to the fun fair
without trying the roller-coasters.

168
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,679
Alright, let's start the debriefing.

169
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,513
The patrol itself. How did it go?

170
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,914
Individual skills really sucked.
Seriously.

171
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,868
How many fell to their knees
on short stops?

172
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,712
So, eight men out of 50.

173
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,952
Do we agree that
this has to be improved?

174
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,275
Get into the habit now.
Get your fat ass down on its knees -

175
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,194
- because at some point
if you don't, then pow!

176
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,309
So kneel, damn it!
Right. Anything else?

177
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,032
I think I ought to say what I got out
of this patrol. And it wasn't a lot.

178
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,510
Remember this is an agricultural area.

179
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,435
The peasants have just sown their
wheat. And we're ploughing it down.

180
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,469
I could only say that our security out
there was to trample their fields down.

181
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,675
Nothing's happening out there yet.

182
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,868
The good old classic. The coolest
thing about porn is the story line.

183
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,795
I'd like doctors like that,
if I go to hospital.

184
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,470
Strangely enough it helped him!

185
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,756
It's weird, don't you think?
You volunteer to sleep on a tiny cot -

186
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,798
- and eat crap food for six months.

187
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,151
- I know there's more to it.
- I'm doing it for the team spirit.

188
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,676
- Team spirit and adventure.
- Yeah.

189
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,594
- How do your parents feel about it?
- They're not overjoyed.

190
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,311
"Don't go on missions." -

191
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,918
So I decided to go to Kosovo,
and on my first day at the garrison -

192
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,437
- I still thought
I was going to Kosovo.

193
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,550
But at the meeting we were told
that Kosovo wasn't an option.

194
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,993
Here it's all 'Afghan'.
I called my mother afterwards -

195
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,711
- and told her I was going
to Afghanistan after all.

196
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,791
She cried her eyes out.

197
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,069
Fucking hell, Rasmus.
What time is it?

198
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,630
- 41 minutes past.
- What's this? A little mullah?

199
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,994
- Are those animals? Two foxes?
- They sure aren't hedgehogs.

200
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,110
What the hell was that?

201
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,312
- Was that mortars?
- Call in and find out.

202
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,276
You know what's going on?
Over.

203
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,238
I have a good idea.
I'll just check it out.

204
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,191
It's probably the person digging
from before that we engaged. Over.

205
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,033
It's cool they bombed the idiot.
Too bad we can't see him.

206
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,354
You'll be an easy target now.

207
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,034
- It's doing a recce.
- Nice.

208
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,192
It's our eyes out there.

209
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,832
It's cool that it can check out
suspicious things in a compound.

210
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,353
Right.

211
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,079
I'd like to see some action now.

212
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,677
I don't know
what my first reaction will be.

213
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,868
We haven't got a chance to know what
it's like, when we haven't tried it.

214
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,433
And the thought of these
'foreign fighters', you know.

215
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,630
I can imagine that the first contact
will be rather spicy.

216
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,156
He could be Taliban.

217
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,188
Just like anyone
of the 7 billion people out there.

218
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,309
- Too bad we can't tell them apart.
- The only difference is the weapon.

219
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,031
He could be hiding it
under his clothes.

220
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,796
But it's clever.
Imagine we could do the same.

221
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,633
Do you think anyone
is watching us?

222
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,315
- Someone's always watching us.
- Right.

223
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,268
There's bound to be someone
in these compounds -

224
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,592
- who is on the Taliban side
and keeps an eye on us.

225
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,878
What are you seeing?

226
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,588
What does he want?

227
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,119
What now, Billy Bob?

228
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,831
Hang on a sec.

229
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,836
- Who?
- This guy.

230
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,310
- Is it the informer?
- No, he's lighting a cigarette.

231
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,153
They don't always do that.

232
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,758
There's been an uproar on the net
about the 40 Pakistanis -

233
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,118
- who are said to be entrenched -

234
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,628
- but their presence hasn't been
verified. It could be a spook or real.

235
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,110
We're going on a domination patrol -

236
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,559
- which is a matter of preventing him
from moving freely -

237
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,670
- and denying him the upper hand
or being master of the domain.

238
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,078
We've got your back.

239
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,679
Any updates? Over.
- Enemy forces have been sent out.

240
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,876
Roger that.

241
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,950
Who are you?
British? Canadian?

242
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,429
- Danish.
- Danish?

243
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,195
- Are you Jewish or Christian?
- Jewish?

244
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,399
No.
We're Christian.

245
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,269
Why are you here?
Look what you've done to our soil.

246
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,273
Look!
You shot it up.

247
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,672
You killed our cow.

248
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,072
- And you've wounded our family.
- Why did you do that?

249
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,473
- The Taliban are way over there.
- They have lots of big weapons.

250
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,599
And they'll shoot you.

251
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,959
903 Victor, October-fest Carlsberg.
Over.

252
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,069
Roger. When the civilians are gone,
they'll open fire. Correct?

253
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,470
Get down!

254
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,598
I have impact.

255
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,479
Scan the area!

256
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,840
- Did you see where it came from?
- Signaler, let's go.

257
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,915
What was that?

258
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,631
90, any report on that smoke?
Was it incoming?

259
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,272
- What did you say?
- The Taliban are ready to attack.

260
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,038
- It's jammed.
- Shit.

261
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,070
- Cover us, so 6 can get up here.
- This crap isn't working.

262
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,232
Hurry, Mini.

263
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,910
- <i>Allahu Akbar,</i>
- Signaler, into the water.

264
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,749
They're behind the two compounds
in a hollow.

265
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,516
- Two shooters.
- Krag, ready to go over the top?

266
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,912
Between the two compounds
in the hollow. Ready?

267
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,677
- Over there! Can you see them?
- No.

268
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,310
- They're in the hollow.
- Yes.

269
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,272
Between the two compounds.
Red smoke. 500 m.

270
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,149
- Get ready to fire the recoilless gun.
- Firing!

271
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,673
Reload, reload ...!

272
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,156
Everybody out!

273
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,311
Way to go!

274
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,549
- Super.
- Well done.

275
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,757
It's a nice big hole.

276
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,990
- What do you think, guys?
- That's what I call a gun slit.

277
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,436
We can see the whole terrain.
He was near the ditch.

278
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,878
- The Taliban are ready to fire.
- Careful! Stay down!

279
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,237
The Taliban have reported
they can see five of us.

280
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,029
- Signaler, let's move away.
- I'm coming.

281
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,872
Hit the deck!

282
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,196
- 5, get down!
- Hey! Isn't it over?

283
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,318
No! Get down!
Whisky reports, "Get down."

284
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,431
- The people standing could get shot.
- Whisky sees ninjas everywhere.

285
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,353
Yes, the guy's a bundle of nerves.

286
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,637
Did you see those guys running?

287
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,358
Where ...?
I've got them.

288
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,875
It's just some kids.

289
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,235
2-5.

290
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,632
Roger. Out.
That was an annoying message.

291
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,155
The locals asked the Taliban
not to shoot -

292
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,350
- so they can evacuate the wounded
women and children. Not good.

293
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,989
- That's gross.
- Is that a wounded or a dead person?

294
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,991
If they really are cowards,
they might be carrying weapons out.

295
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:10,236
- The thought did cross my mind.
- It's a good excuse to stare at us.

296
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,238
And they can move weapons to a new
position, when we're on our way back.

297
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,358
Maybe it's just a civilian casualty.

298
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,312
- That guy's got balls.
- I hate those damn Taliban.

299
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,749
You can't tell who's who, and the
dicks shoot from civilian compounds.

300
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,232
- There's not much we can do.
- No, but it's messy.

301
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,437
- What's up, Signaler?
- Well done. Your baptism of fire.

302
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,832
- It was a good start for beginners.
- I was about to say that.

303
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,917
- It was a good start for beginners.
- Everybody out, everybody home.

304
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,353
Mini?
How much 12.7 ammo did you fire?

305
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,991
- A lot.
- You're damn right.

306
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,880
This is a bit heavy.

307
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,558
When I got into the barn,
the chickens attacked me.

308
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,748
When is the bread done?

309
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,752
Why do we have to do this shit?

310
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,635
Ranger.

311
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,038
Look at this, Mads.

312
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,153
Even if you have a gun,
I'd still win.

313
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,154
- It depends on how far away you are.
- Here.

314
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,711
Let's see who draws first.

315
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,270
You have to release yours,
I just have to swing this.

316
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,557
From down there?

317
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,236
- Can I carry it ...?
- No. Then I'd be like this.

318
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,633
Kim, you can lift it with one hand,
right? Or do you need two hands?

319
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,192
- Ready?
- Gotcha.

320
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,837
Three shots to the chest.

321
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,228
- Quite cool ...
- It doesn't get much better than that.

322
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,148
- See you later, Mads.
- Send my regards.

323
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,958
Alright, Mads?

324
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,518
- I'll close off those streets.
- Fine.

325
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,830
Mini, over there with Kim.

326
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,870
- Why are you with them?
- He's American.

327
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,079
- Why are you with them?
- He's red, too.

328
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,789
Get out of the military. Leave.

329
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,748
- Leave?
- Yes. Go home.

330
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,195
Do you have a home?

331
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,955
I don't owe you any money,
if that's what you're saying.

332
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,232
He has funny eyes.
He is slant-eyed.

333
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,153
They look puffy.

334
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,589
He took it in the ass.

335
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,598
I regret your losses,
but you all know -

336
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,880
- that we have to walk in the fields.

337
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,958
How should we know?
Is it our fault, maybe?

338
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,719
Last year they bombarded our house.

339
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,111
I swear by God I don't even
have any clothes to wear.

340
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,033
And my sons cannot help me.

341
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,549
Then we must leave our villages.
What can we do?

342
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,551
What can we do? It's not you
or the Taliban that gets killed.

343
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,393
We are the ones who get killed.

344
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,549
The civilians get killed.
We sit in our homes and get bombed.

345
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,748
The Taliban shoot, and then
they run away. They escape.

346
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,995
We're sorry, but we try
to move the war up north.

347
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,073
That would be good for us,
for this ruins everything.

348
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,475
You can't.

349
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,635
People fight, because they're poor.
Including the Taliban.

350
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,548
- Come on, you faggots.
- Look who's talking.

351
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,269
You planted bombs, you ape!

352
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:33,675
So far we know that a civilian car
approached the gas station -

353
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,312
- on Highway 1 towards the desert,
the route we usually take home.

354
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,790
The car hit something
and detonated.

355
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,149
There was an explosion.
Our formation is vehicle 1 in front..

356
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,869
Primarily observe
from the rifleman's position.

357
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,079
We'll see how bad it is
when we get there. Okay?

358
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,158
Flip your night vision down
and keep a lookout behind.

359
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,918
On our way back from there
I heard a huge explosion.

360
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,355
I couldn't believe it.

361
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,751
I ran back down -

362
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,119
- and 7-5 and 3-5 ran right into me,
so I went flying.

363
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,272
Everybody was running
all over the place.

364
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,149
Then I heard, "There's
blood everywhere. 2-5 is down."

365
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,359
I said, "For fuck's sake, 5.
You should keep your head down."

366
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,753
Then he said, "I know.
How about a dance?" I cracked up.

367
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,552
"This isn't a good time."
Then I gave him emotional first aid.

368
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,395
He had a huge gash here.
Turned out to be a fractured skull.

369
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,632
Damn.

370
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,831
- No fucking fun.
- I'll say.

371
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,511
I heard a massive boom,
and everything was sand and dust -

372
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,240
- for a few seconds.

373
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,872
I tried to feel if my teeth were broken
with my tongue -

374
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,353
- and I tried to wiggle my fingers.
I couldn't tell if my teeth were okay -

375
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,513
- because I had so much gravel,
sand and blood in my mouth.

376
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,152
I only felt splinters and stones.
I didn't know what was what.

377
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,438
I tried ... I don't remember clearly -

378
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,879
- but I looked down
and saw two trickles of blood.

379
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,874
It wasn't until I was
in the helicopter -

380
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,715
- that I started to get
really uncomfortable.

381
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,634
That's when I had time
to think about it.

382
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,917
"What do I look like now?
Will I ever recover?"

383
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,518
"Will I talk funny for the rest
of my life?" All those questions.

384
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,916
I have to go back to Armadillo
and stand in front of them all -

385
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,959
- and say, "You can't
get rid of me that easily."

386
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,796
- <i>2-5 here.</i>
- Raven has something.

387
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,033
Three men are walking south.
62.7, 31.4.

388
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,910
Can Alpha 1-7 see them running?
Get the coordinates.

389
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,190
- They're splitting up.
- 64.5, 32.0.

390
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,273
Aim at the place
that's been used as a firing point.

391
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,316
Do they have to assemble
the gun first or what?

392
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,869
9-0. Pancake.

393
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,831
- Alright!
- About bloody time.

394
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,237
- Do you want everyone to meet up?
- Yes ...

395
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,597
2nd platoon, at the vehicles.

396
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,196
There he is! Our man.

397
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,955
- Alright?
- You bet. I'm in great shape.

398
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,749
- Hi, guys.
- You smell good, too.

399
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,118
- But you don't.
- Hello!

400
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,118
- Nice to see you.
- Hey, man.

401
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,877
I'm sick of hugging sweaty guys by
now. Who else? Jesus Christ.

402
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,554
Hey, guys.
Are we all here?

403
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,671
Hey, man.

404
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,550
- I'm glad you grew that beard again.
- I thought you might feel that way.

405
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,117
- Here's group leader 1.
- Well, for the time being.

406
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,637
It's fucking great to see you guys.
Any questions?

407
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,519
Great. Let's go.

408
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,635
Signaler, the locals say the Taliban
bugged out north and south -

409
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,155
- when they saw us arrive.

410
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,829
Signaler, will you cover me
if I run out in the field?

411
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,356
- Probably not.
- This is damn depressing.

412
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,878
All dressed up
and no one to blow. This won't do.

413
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,477
- Wanna bet?
- Nothing will happen.

414
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,997
Nothing will happen?
It's no fun betting when we agree.

415
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,479
Daniel, how about stripping
and running naked across the field?

416
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,158
- That might kick things up a notch.
- His pink body will scare them off.

417
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,153
Shut the fuck up.

418
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,276
The other day ...
My house was bombed.

419
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,434
My cow was killed,
and two calves.

420
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,558
They didn't die,
they were wounded.

421
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,553
A cow was killed.
Two calves were injured.

422
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,349
Our guard dog
was also blown to bits.

423
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,430
Look.
The animals were tied up in here.

424
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,630
There are 19 of us.
The cow gave us milk.

425
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,396
- Now we have nothing, no money.
- We can compensate you for it.

426
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,199
Hello. How are you?

427
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:48,993
Can you come to the camp
this evening or tonight?

428
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:56,157
It's very difficult.
People get killed. They're afraid.

429
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,836
But it's important
that we collaborate.

430
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,037
So we can make peace here.

431
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,513
God willing, we can bring peace
to this place. Rebuild the country ...

432
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,674
Exactly, but we'll see.
God will provide.

433
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,958
We ... the country is exhausted.

434
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,115
2-1, can we move forward,
or do we wait?

435
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,673
- Having a nice time?
- We don't have to cuddle up.

436
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,755
Unless you want to.
I have a hole in my pants.

437
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,196
I can use my finger if you like?

438
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,710
- You missed. A bit further up.
- No thanks.

439
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,234
Christ, this is boring.

440
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,358
Their cow was killed by mortars
the day before yesterday.

441
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:09,197
- You can see where.
- That doesn't look recent.

442
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,070
- It's been like that for a while.
- We saw where he buried the cow.

443
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,870
We can sense that the Taliban
are intimidating people in the area.

444
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,433
The locals say we're here
to kill animals and people.

445
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,196
- And the Taliban take advantage ...
- Of what's going on. Obviously.

446
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,199
Okay, we need to move forward, boys.

447
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,351
- The aerial sees two men in Sierra 5.
- We're at Sierra 5.

448
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,798
- Should we take it and crush them?
- Daniel? New plan.

449
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,556
Two guys in Sierra 5.
Right there!

450
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,156
- Do you want explosives?
- Let's wait and see.

451
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:06,075
There's still that hole in the wall.
The hole straight ahead.

452
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,515
Proceed. I got it here.
Get in front.

453
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,275
There's something here.

454
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,148
There's a civilian.

455
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,196
Forward.

456
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,115
There's no one here.

457
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,478
Civilians in the compound.
We will continue searching.

458
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,677
There's no one here.

459
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,513
Salaam aleikum.

460
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,911
901, 5 is searched. Out.

461
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,039
Fuck, I'm tired of this shit.

462
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,709
They're laughing at us, and we waste
time blasting into these compounds.

463
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,270
And they're already gone.
A waste of time.

464
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,834
- Mortar, another 15 ts.
- Ready ...!

465
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,639
Everybody ready ... shoot!

466
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,911
She had abdominal injuries.

467
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,358
And a fractured skull.

468
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,028
That's your target.

469
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,795
I did what we had planned.

470
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,358
There's nothing to do about it.

471
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,796
It's ... I almost said 'spilt milk'.

472
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,635
Harsh words, but that's what it is.

473
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:39,033
It can't be undone,
and you shouldn't blame yourself.

474
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,829
We live in a world,
where you watch the news -

475
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,675
- with thousands of people,
who die all the time ...

476
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,833
So it doesn't bother me if a girl dies.
It's just because you're close to it.

477
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,232
I just think ... We came down here,
and it wasn't done on purpose.

478
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,678
We did exactly what we're supposed
to do, and we would do it again.

479
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,159
That's the way it is.

480
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:15,596
I'm very tired. My house was burnt
down, and that's why I'm here.

481
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,873
My mother died,
and so did my little child.

482
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:36,039
We were away. Only my mother
and the little one stayed at home.

483
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,671
I told my mother to come along,
but she didn't want to.

484
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,269
You have to tell us
which things were destroyed.

485
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:02,709
Quilts, matresses, curtains, plates and
lots of other things in my house.

486
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,913
May God forgive your mother.
She has become a martyr.

487
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,353
Mini, observe for the fucking platoon.
A situation is reported -

488
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,193
- but they move forward anyway.

489
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,393
Let's get the fuck out of here!

490
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,838
Wait!

491
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,399
Oh no ...!

492
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,638
Say something, man!

493
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,477
Is everyone okay? Over.

494
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,395
Negative, negative.
Condition critical.

495
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:16,793
He can talk, but has
difficulty breathing. Over.

496
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:23,479
Copy that. Get him to my position
quickly. I'll get ready here.

497
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,193
Fuck ...! Here we go.

498
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,155
3-4 here. The helicopter
will be here in two minutes.

499
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,316
Copy. We'll start moving him
to pick-up point. Over.

500
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,837
We've sent our call signs
minus four men -

501
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,675
- who're picking up the last bits.

502
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:53,756
We have a vehicle to secure us
and expect to arrive in ten. Over.

503
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:23,269
His condition is stable, but his
left leg was amputated at the thigh -

504
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,831
- and his right leg below the knee.

505
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,631
He was wounded in the groin -

506
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,318
- and in the abdomen,
but there was no internal bleeding.

507
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,157
They think he'll survive,
but he was seriously wounded.

508
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,636
They've found our weak points
and are making the most of them.

509
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:55,032
Yes, we're good at attacking
and moving forward -

510
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,069
- but we're held back because
of those damn IEDs we can't find.

511
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,715
It's all fucked up.

512
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,749
When you think about it,
you wouldn't feel guilty about -

513
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:21,029
- shooting those assholes.
I'd feel worse shooting a stray dog.

514
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,640
Right.

515
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,754
On our way back from patrol
we were told -

516
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,516
- that three men from Romeo 1-5
hit an IED on Highway 1.

517
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:44,789
At that point, they were category B,
which is seriously wounded.

518
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,795
When we got back here,
we were told all three were dead.

519
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,316
I think everyone was hoping -

520
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:00,794
- that we would go down in history
as the first team not to lose a man.

521
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:11,714
Then they showed pictures of those
three handsome young men -

522
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:17,716
- who were smiling,
and whose eyes were shining.

523
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:24,228
They looked happy. I can't take
much more of this, Mads.

524
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,597
- It's really, really hard.
- Yes.

525
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,470
Please be careful.

526
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,590
Come home soon.

527
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,231
I will.
Another two months to go.

528
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,395
Let's commemorate
our three fellow men -

529
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,680
- and honor them and show
our respect with a minute of silence.

530
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,353
The men are getting tired.
Wahir, where we were doing well -

531
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,799
- is now infiltrated by the Taliban.

532
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,193
They know exactly
how many we are in the camp -

533
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:55,912
- and when we're up to something
or not. We'll have to see ...

534
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,037
...if ambushing them will work.

535
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,276
Is anyone too upset to go?

536
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,113
- I'd like to stay home.
- Me, too.

537
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,796
Mads, are you okay?
You don't mind going?

538
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:28,310
Well, if you need me,
I'll come along.

539
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,038
Great.

540
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:15,351
Go get the job done.
You know what to do, so be careful.

541
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,830
Give them hell in the morning.
That's the whole point.

542
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,232
See you tomorrow.
Safe journey.

543
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:39,515
One group of enemy forces
reported ready. Over.

544
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,670
Several civilians
are heading your way.

545
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,753
On the right-hand side
of the men in the back.

546
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,035
Women and children
are leaving the zone.

547
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,149
There are several combat indicators.
More families are leaving the zone.

548
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,396
There's no mistaking that.

549
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:12,236
Okay, the last ICOM says they've
spotted our patrol and will ambush it.

550
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,478
I have a possible digger
about 200-250m north of me -

551
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,428
- at a compound.
Request warning shot. Over.

552
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,433
Copy. Stand by.

553
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,557
- It's a damn kill zone out there.
- Fine with me, as long as they shoot.

554
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,833
All those on the right,
return to the trees.

555
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,631
3, retreat to the compound wall.

556
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:33,079
- What did you do so far?
- I gave him morphine in the thigh.

557
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:38,553
And I gave him Fentanyl.
His pulse was fine.

558
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,470
- Can he have a drink?
- Yes.

559
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,038
Where the hell are those bastards?

560
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,432
- Give me a fucking Taliban, man.
- Forward!

561
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,758
Let's go, move forward.

562
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:40,031
- Fuck, they almost got me!
- Cover for fuck's sake! Cover!

563
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,590
I can't hear you.

564
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,196
We're in the open field.
Where are you?

565
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,989
You're on my right
in the open field.

566
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:59,393
- Hold your fire!
- 3, you're shooting at the trees.

567
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,588
- I'm on the other side, you idiot.
- The Taliban are in the ditch.

568
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,672
What the fuck is he talking about?

569
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,150
The Taliban are
in the ditch in front of you.

570
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,198
- Right in front of us!
- Daniel!

571
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,920
- Can you get him with a grenade?
- Yes.

572
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,469
Fire in the hole!

573
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,395
Now we neutralize them.
Kim, over here!

574
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,755
- You're walking towards each other.
- Frederik was hit!

575
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,276
- There's another one here.
- Frederik was hit in the leg.

576
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,671
- Who?
- Frederik. He's lying out here.

577
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,236
- Who was hit?
- Frederik. He's lying out here.

578
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,032
- Kim ...! Go help Frederik.
- Hold your fire!

579
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,315
- Here we are, Frederik.
- Is that guy dead, or what?

580
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:07,996
Frederik, if you can limp,
then let's get over to that building.

581
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,879
- Super.
- Where to ...?

582
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,032
- Where to?
- To your right.

583
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,198
Stay here.
I'll take him.

584
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,877
Hey! There's one more here!
And two more over there!

585
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,988
- Easy, easy ...
- They have to fucking die!

586
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,197
- He's already on his way.
- Good job!

587
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,790
- There are three dead over there.
- Move on, Daniel!

588
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,838
They fired from the corner over there.

589
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,432
As soon as we've cleaned up, we ...

590
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,558
5, I've got a hand-grenade.

591
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:20,556
- I need you to check my arm.
- What the hell ...? Your arm?

592
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,234
Look at this ...

593
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,439
- It was stuck in my soft armor.
- Your soft armor?

594
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,070
- Where precisely?
- Look, it's ...

595
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,478
- And through here. And there.
- Shit.

596
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,354
- Damn, that was crazy!
- Hole is cleaned!

597
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,114
Fucking pigs, man!

598
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,708
- Alright?
- Yes.

599
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,313
Good.
Keep your hand still.

600
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,112
Try holding it upwards.

601
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,398
- 30 seconds ...
- 30 seconds.

602
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,990
- Damn, that was crazy.
- There are five dead in the ditch.

603
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,958
Five dead Taliban right there?

604
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,351
This feels completely surreal.

605
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,678
- Where are those assholes?
- I shot this one in the head.

606
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,956
- Damn, it stinks.
- Shut up.

607
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,240
- Let go of it.
- There's one more.

608
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,109
- Wait a sec. You cover me!
- Of course.

609
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,150
This will be messy. Oh, you went
commando, you sick bastard.

610
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:33,389
- Are those hand guns or magazines?
- He had a pistol apparently.

611
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,874
They already stink.

612
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,159
Kim, if you've tried slaughtering
animals, this is no big deal.

613
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,232
That's a bit much, isn't it?

614
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,630
No guns.

615
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,833
It's a good thing
they aren't any heavier.

616
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,435
What are you packing, buddy?

617
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,959
Okay, get ready to move forward.

618
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,116
How many shots did you fire?
You really went at it.

619
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:36,798
- Don't they deserve to die?
- Sure. I don't feel sorry for them.

620
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,914
- The water in the stream was red.
- "There's no one there."

621
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:52,231
"Yes, there is!"
Then you figured it out.

622
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,155
It was a ricochet. It nicked me
and was stopped there.

623
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,198
I have the bullet in my pocket.

624
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,717
- 40 seconds.
- Pancake!

625
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,038
Way to go!

626
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,158
- Welcome. We have sodas.
- Sounds good.

627
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:33,677
Great job.
That was fucking awesome.

628
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,719
- Four of them with a fucking grenade.
- It was nice.

629
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:42,078
Fuck, that was great.
This is something we'll never forget.

630
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,791
That was some of the best
fucking soldiering I've ever seen.

631
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,679
You did a damn good job.

632
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,355
They didn't have any ID
or cell phones on them.

633
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,389
I had to pull one of them
by the head from under a log.

634
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,678
- He was stuck underneath it.
- Yuck. All the dead Afghans.

635
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,197
Mini, your eyes were huge.
You just stood there staring at them.

636
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,909
The worst thing was with 3.
"They are in the creek."

637
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,358
I didn't believe them, but emptied
a magazine down the creek.

638
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,832
"They're still there!"
"No, there's nobody there."

639
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,391
Hand grenade! I came up, there were
four of them lying there, rattling.

640
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,039
Then 5 wanted to be in on it, so
he emptied a magazine under the log.

641
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:36,274
- Then Signaler and I found one more.
- Yeah, he said so.

642
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,831
- Not much fun for those Talibobs.
- They were in a bad spot.

643
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:46,510
Olby, you say four on the first side?
Plus two more on the other side.

644
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,240
- No, only one.
- There were two.

645
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:54,474
Wasn't there one farther along?
When we turned the corner -

646
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:59,873
- I'm sure we fired at two of them.
- I searched the whole lot.

647
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:06,832
You went back? Okay. Well, no one
crawled away after we were there.

648
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:26,236
Good afternoon.
Everyone's back from the Green Zone.

649
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:31,076
It was a hectic morning.
I think we all agree on that.

650
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:36,075
The wounded are doing alright.
I have a fresh update on them.

651
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,916
- Both were operated on.
- Louder!

652
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,029
One of them in the shoulder,
the other in the leg.

653
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:51,797
Grejs says he's sorry
he won't be coming back.

654
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:58,354
He's going back to Denmark for
rehabilitation. That's all we know.

655
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,475
You did a good job
and showed guts, 2nd platoon.

656
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,279
Today was a close shave.

657
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,513
Anything else?
Have a nice day.

658
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:23,235
- War booty!
- Loots of war!

659
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,712
Let's start the debriefing.

660
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,749
I want to get through it quickly,
and get to the point.

661
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:41,597
Today we can establish
that we didn't fire at each other.

662
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,435
There were many instances,
where we were in doubt -

663
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,795
- and mistakes have happened.

664
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:52,397
I had my doubts that
the enemy was only 3m away.

665
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,031
I hear you hollering
that he's close by, and I say "No!"

666
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:03,196
In the end I was so irritated that I
emptied a magazine down the stream.

667
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,069
I thought that would be enough,
but you said no -

668
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,869
- and that's when
we threw a grenade.

669
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,157
Afterwards Signaler and I -

670
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:20,634
- found four men groaning heavily
in the ditch, feeling rather bad.

671
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,716
We liquidated them
in the most humane way possible.

672
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,237
5 joined in and fired a magazine
under a little bridge -

673
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,915
- and we cleaned the area
and found the shooter Ian mentioned.

674
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:41,474
- He was hit and moaning.
- He was trying to crawl.

675
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:46,191
- We shot him 30-40 times.
- We finished them off.

676
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,759
- Thanks!
- That was it.

677
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:48,514
It was fucking awesome.
Not while it was happening -

678
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,435
- but when we got back. Now we've
been at war. Now we've tried it.

679
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,594
I never felt that way on patrol
before. Normally it's just boring.

680
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,035
But this time I thought -

681
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:06,399
- there was a real risk
of being boxed in.

682
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,553
I never thought that before.
We outnumber them -

683
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,633
- and have cool weapons, so they
can't touch us. But here they could.

684
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:21,673
But I'd still like to try it again.
One more time.

685
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,434
I wouldn't.

686
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:30,038
Think about it! When your tour is over,
you'll feel so much better about it.

687
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,394
- Yes.
- It's true.

688
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,678
Making a difference
is a cool feeling.

689
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,197
Having been up shit creek
will feel great once you're back home.

690
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,798
Imagine if our tour was just a load
of crap with nothing going on -

691
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,872
- and only boring patrols.

692
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:56,272
- It would be a lame way to go home.
- Right.

693
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,199
We're gonna see Frederiks' leg.

694
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,715
He has to show us.

695
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,073
- What's up?
- Turn around.

696
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,038
Way to go, man!

697
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,873
- Good to see you, Grejs.
- You, too.

698
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:30,593
- So, are you hooked up with Brits?
- They are all bloody Afghans.

699
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,753
- Even some Taliban.
- Really?

700
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:41,069
Actually, one came in with eyes
covered and his hands tied yesterday.

701
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,791
- If you go back inside, we'll come in.
See you inside.

702
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,635
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

703
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,634
- A well-placed shot afterwards.
- Brilliant.

704
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,113
The bullet entered here
and was sticking out of my ass.

705
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,397
- They had to dig it out.
- Cool.

706
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:09,591
I totally forgot about the pain
because the chopper flew like this.

707
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:17,792
I don't know if you heard,
but Olby got four with a grenade.

708
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,676
- They were moaning.
- I don't know how many it killed.

709
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,038
But three of them
were lying in a pile.

710
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:34,435
You could only see an ear and the left
side of the head of one of them.

711
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:39,071
The rest was hanging off him.
Two of them were underneath him.

712
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:43,358
I thought, "What the fuck?"
They were on top of each other.

713
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,469
Another was under a log,
and another was farther away.

714
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,997
- He was crawling on the ground.
- No, he wasn't.

715
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,994
So we hit the jackpot in that ditch.

716
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,879
Okay, guys.

717
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,634
Bye.

718
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,111
I've got two things for you.
You definitely get the Horse.

719
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,192
- Thanks a lot.
- You deserve it.

720
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:19,230
You fought with us and with Special
Forces. Super ... Damn fine job.

721
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,230
Listen up. I was questioned
by the MPs this evening.

722
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:41,396
Apparently someone called home
and told their parents -

723
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,472
- that we liquidated
wounded people -

724
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:49,191
- and piled up the dead, to take
pictures of ourselves as heroes.

725
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:56,277
And that I personally returned
and killed some wounded Talibans.

726
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:01,594
People have also said that we laughed
about this during our debriefing.

727
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:09,190
The parents ... or this mother has
contacted Operational Command -

728
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,069
- and asked if that is how
we deal with things here.

729
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,789
What bothers me the most
right now ...

730
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,950
...is the question of loyalty.
I have to know -

731
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:28,033
- if anyone here believes
that this is what happened.

732
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:33,433
Does anyone honestly believe that?
Yes ...?

733
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:39,118
If I had listened to our debriefing
and the sequence of events -

734
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:44,308
- I would have thought
it was extremely ... delicate.

735
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:50,749
I could understand if outsiders, who
weren't there got that impression.

736
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,673
We were still on a high afterwards.

737
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,116
You have to take that
into consideration.

738
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,829
It was an extreme experience,
so we used extreme words.

739
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,472
If the press makes a case of this,
and people think we're psychos -

740
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,430
- well, let them think so.
They weren't there, they didn't see it.

741
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:17,470
They weren't there,
but we know what happened.

742
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,677
Let them talk.
They weren't there.

743
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,071
If they make a case out of this,
we'll be suspended -

744
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:29,030
- and then we'll be blowing bubbles,
and that's it until we go home.

745
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:35,435
And we'll go down in military history,
apart from those who knew us -

746
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,152
- as the guys who fucked up.
Anyone who's named in this case -

747
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,153
- including myself,
Daniel and Signaler -

748
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:50,236
- can look forward to a long session
with the whole military circus.

749
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,791
"You weren't there, man" to that.

750
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,034
I believe that Signaler and Daniel had
the balls to do the right thing -

751
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,839
- at the right time.

752
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,709
To proceed the way they did
with two wounded, one near miss -

753
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,509
- and three men with holes
in their uniform and so on ...

754
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,549
To walk up and shoot ... Had I seen
movement, I would have fired, too.

755
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:21,192
And it only took Daniel or Signaler
to point under the log and say:

756
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,237
"One here, one there."

757
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,995
That was enough for me
to flip to automatic and shoot.

758
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,676
I didn't feel like sticking my head
down to someone with a gun.

759
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,355
And yes, it was touch and go.

760
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:42,392
But in my world you do what you do.
If you have the strength not to shoot -

761
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,314
- because you realize that the
movement is not that of a weapon -

762
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:51,554
- but a surrender or whatever ... If
you have the strength to realize this -

763
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,998
- you don't shoot, of course,
but had I been there -

764
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:00,392
- I would also have fired, and
I did fire, because I wasn't sure.

765
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,676
That was enough for me.

766
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:29,513
I think it's hard for people at home
to understand how ...

767
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:36,028
- How the decision is made?
- How you can just take a life.

768
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:40,512
You have to be here
to understand it.

769
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:45,310
This place is whacked, after all.
It's a fucked-up country.

770
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,675
No doubt about it.

771
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,913
People who understand
the war itself -

772
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,789
- and how you and I and others feel
about being here -

773
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:00,158
- and making a difference,
those people will understand us.

774
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:06,111
Outsiders might sneer
and say that we're insane -

775
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,955
- or that we did something terrible.

776
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,478
I know I did the right thing.

777
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:19,428
I know we all did the right thing.

778
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:57,398
In case you don't know, I was
questioned by MPs this morning -

779
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:02,588
- regarding our case with the snitch.
So far it's 'a matter of rumor' -

780
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:08,517
- which they'll try to quash
at battalion level.

781
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:14,073
So if you hear anything,
then dismiss it as a rumor -

782
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:18,995
- because that's what it is.
So it's just a lot of hot air.

783
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,470
It may come back to haunt us -

784
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:26,872
- but it is a lot of hot air
without any truth in it.

785
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,672
Alright?
That's it.

786
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,719
Good day.

787
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,476
I have a few things to say today.
First of all -

788
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:45,078
- I'd like to award Silver and Gold
Horses for our recent engagement.

789
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,835
The first two are Joe and Olby.

790
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:58,310
Joe and Olby did something that
others might feel differently about.

791
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,109
These guys did it. Five
Taliban were firing at the platoon.

792
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,353
Our guys stormed them with
a hand grenade and neutralized them.

793
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,353
This takes courage,
and I'm proud of you.

794
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,672
I'm awarding you the Gold Horse,
and you both deserve it.

795
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:22,472
We'll see if it leads to more.
Damn fine job.

796
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,719
Congratulations.
Well deserved.

797
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,519
And one for you, Joe.

798
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,719
Congratulations.
You deserve it. Give them a hand.

799
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,273
What does it say ...?
Smith is a part-time transvestite -

800
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,159
- and a full-time idiot.

801
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,959
Deep thoughts ...

802
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:00,478
- Not a lot of deep stuff here.
- The deepest was painted over.

803
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,760
The guys were a bit pissed about that.
Of course there was a lot of shit -

804
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,515
- but there's also stuff which ...

805
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,193
Which was quite cool to read.

806
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:19,638
And it would be cool to see
your own stuff, if you came back.

807
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,198
"In the North I know the fairest land.
My people, my home, my native land."

808
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,990
"Denmark."
That was quite poetic.

809
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:47,077
WELCOME HOME
Thanks for your efforts ...
