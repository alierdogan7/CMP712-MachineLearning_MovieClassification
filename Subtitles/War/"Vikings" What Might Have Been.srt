00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,081
And from these forts, we will defend
the city, if necessary, to the death.

360
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,010
We are ready for the heathen.

361
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,268
Your Grace,

362
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:29,080
you are the difference
between failure and triumph.

363
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:33,557
With your help, we can frustrate
and defeat the enemy.

364
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,307
I beg and beseech you.

365
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:41,997
I actually would fall on my knees
before you. Me, the Emperor.

366
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:44,276
The grandson of Charlemagne himself.

367
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:45,834
Yes.

368
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:48,401
I would beg you,

369
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,463
for all we have given you,

370
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:55,410
not to change sides.

371
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,870
Not to betray us.

372
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:00,518
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,

373
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:02,751
for the sake of Paris,

374
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,690
do not return to your brother.

375
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:16,674
I will not betray you.

376
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:19,729
I will not betray Paris.

377
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,703
And I will not betray my wife.

378
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:23,838
(CHUCKLES)

379
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,245
ODO: Of course he will
betray us if he can.

380
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:34,862
(SCOFFS) Paris must never be
left to the mercies of a pagan.

381
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:37,585
I thought he had become a Christian.

382
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:38,785
(CHUCKLES)

383
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,877
(SIGHS) Do you really believe that?

384
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:48,496
Is it really possible?
Personally, I don't think so.

385
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:51,298
When Ragnar appears, when
his brother appears,

386
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:54,401
is it not likely that our
Duke Rollo will embrace him?

387
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,737
Don't you think they might have
already planned these things?

388
00:34:57,673 --> 00:34:59,439
I thought you needed
him to fight with you.

389
00:34:59,508 --> 00:35:00,841
I was wrong.

390
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:04,711
He was useful to us early on.

391
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,747
I would've got rid of him subsequently.

392
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:10,350
You see, these are precisely the
decisions an emperor must make

393
00:35:10,418 --> 00:35:12,018
if he wishes to keep his throne.

394
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,753
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

395
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:18,823
Are you ready for me to undress?

396
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:23,162
Undress?

397
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,174
No, not tonight.

398
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:29,588
I will chain you up, just as you are.

399
00:35:30,104 --> 00:35:31,463
If that is your will.

400
00:35:46,887 --> 00:35:48,287
(WHIP CRACKS)

401
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,904
You are treated very badly.

402
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,690
The Emperor fawns upon the Northman.

403
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,346
He should trust you more.

404
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:16,181
He should trust me above the Northman.

405
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,453
He does not know who to trust.

406
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:28,124
He's an idiot.

407
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:31,448
I have lost all faith.

408
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,463
What will you do?

409
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:52,014
(GRUNTS)

410
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:58,220
Do I have your permission?

411
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,859
Yes. What will you do?

00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,092
- (GRUNTS)
- (GASPS)

413
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,462
I will save Paris a second time.

414
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,897
I do not need Rollo.
I will do it myself.

415
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:10,666
- And then?
- And then...

416
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:11,833
(GRUNTS)

417
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,071
I will organize a coup
against the Emperor.

418
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,107
I will have him killed
and I will replace him.

419
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:21,777
You will be the Emperor?

420
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:25,313
Yes, I will be the Emperor.

421
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:27,082
Long live the Emperor!

422
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:28,616
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)

423
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:32,119
(PANTING) I love it.
Long live the Emperor.

424
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:34,489
Long live the Emperor.

425
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:06,427
There's no sign of Rollo's camp.

426
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:07,610
No.

427
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,333
Does that surprise you?

428
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,353
(GROANS)

429
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:53,327
Ivar. Ivar, wake up.

430
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,038
See who's here. It's Harbard.

431
00:40:58,376 --> 00:41:01,043
You remember Harbard, don't you?

432
00:41:01,112 --> 00:41:02,445
Hello, Ivar.

433
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:04,881
Blessed Ivar.

BJORN: Halt!

436
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:55,421
Is that not Rollo?

437
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,057
You know very well.
