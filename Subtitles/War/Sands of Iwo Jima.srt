Muvuca - Zohar Group

1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,170
This is the story of a squad of marines,
a rifle squad.

2
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:59,089
I'm Corporal Robert Dunne,
a member of that squad.

3
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:03,008
We were at Guadalcanal,
and when it was secure

4
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:08,262
we were pulled out for rest, refitting,
replacements and retraining.

5
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,722
The Marine Corps is long on training
and retraining...

6
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,848
Let that go.

7
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:19,185
After the canal, we were sent to
Camp Paekakariki in New Zealand.

8
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:23,938
Here we received our replacements,
marines from Stateside,

9
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:28,899
a long way from Stateside, 8,000 miles.

10
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,154
I can see you're a man
who knows how to live.

11
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:38,447
- Solid comfort.
- Solid malaria.

12
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:43,784
- Malaria, huh? Contagious?
- No, not this week. You can stay.

13
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:48,537
Nice place you got here.
Regazzi's my name, Benny Regazzi.

14
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:50,998
Bob Dunne. I'm duty NCO today.

15
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:55,333
Great. Meet my friends. This big guy
is "Handsome" Dan Shipley.

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,585
- Hi.
- What a physique!

17
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:02,671
The girls see him and faint. He comes
through this, I'll make him a movie star!

18
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,132
Those two guys, Flynns.
That's Eddie and that's Frank.

19
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,383
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hello, Bob.

20
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:11,135
They don't drink. I got their beer ration.

21
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:14,512
- And Georgie Hellenopolis, an Irishman.
- Hello, sport.

22
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:18,140
- Where did you get those cards?
- Off your sack on the ship. Why?

23
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:22,851
- They're mine, that's why.
- I've seen lots in those bags that aren't.

24
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,936
- Come on, give me.
- "Semper fi", Mac.

25
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:30,355
- Hey!
- Leave them. It happens 20 times a day.

26
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:38,528
You know where those guys come from?
Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.

27
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,407
- By the way, who's the squad leader?
- Sergeant Stryker.

28
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,658
- What's he like?
- You'll find out.

29
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,203
I've been in New Zealand two hours
and already they're clamming up on me.

30
00:03:58,457 --> 00:04:01,542
- I hope he knows his stuff.
- Maybe we'll get liberty.

31
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,754
- We ain't replacements any more.
- Where is he? Where's the sergeant?

32
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,006
He's here.

33
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,799
- Well, what do you know? Stryker.
- Hello, Thomas.

34
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:17,844
- Thought you were in the First.
- I was. Sit down.

35
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,305
Just sit down, Thomas, anywhere.

36
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:30,061
My name is Stryker,
Sergeant John M Stryker.

37
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,188
You're gonna be my squad, a rifle squad.

38
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:38,191
Three of us have seen action: Corporal
Dunne, Charlie Bass and myself.

39
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,528
You'll learn from us. In boot camp
you learned out of a book.

40
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:48,656
Here you gotta remember the book and
learn things that haven't been printed.

41
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,908
You gotta learn right and fast.

42
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:58,329
Any man that doesn't want to cooperate,
I'll make him wish he hadn't been born.

43
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:03,290
Before I'm through with you, you're
gonna move and think like one man.

44
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:08,544
If you don't, you'll be dead.
You guys have had a nice easy day.

45
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:14,089
I hope you enjoyed it because
it's the last one you'll get for a long time.

46
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:18,843
You joined the Marines to fight and
you'll get your chance. I'll show you how.

47
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:23,637
If I can't teach you one way, I'll teach you
another. But I'll get the job done.

48
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:26,973
The skipper of this outfit
is Captain Joyce.

49
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:31,892
Platoon leader is Lieutenant Baker.
Platoon sergeant is Sergeant Wright.

50
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,143
Any questions?

51
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,604
That's all.

52
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:45,067
10,000 sergeants in this corps
and I draw Stryker!

53
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:47,402
You knew this guy before?

54
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:52,072
Yeah. We were stationed
together in China.

55
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:55,949
Twice he kept me from promotion.
Turned me in once.

56
00:05:56,158 --> 00:06:01,995
30 days I got.
He was a sergeant major then.

57
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:05,455
Must have done something to get busted
to three stripes.

58
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,332
What did he turn you in for?

59
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:14,336
For... That's not important!
What's important is that he turned me in!

60
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:19,131
Maybe he didn't write the manual, but
you can bet he can recite it backwards!

61
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:26,468
- It's probably tattooed on his chest.
- Front and back, Mac.

62
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,221
- Say, isn't your name Al Thomas?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,515
- Weren't you a fighter?
- Just in the Marines.

64
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:39,561
- Runner-up in the heavyweight division.
- Tell him who you were runner-up to.

65
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,188
Stryker. Lucky punch.

66
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,939
Meet your new manager.

67
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:49,775
Tell him why you lost your stripes.

68
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:55,654
My natural dislike for you is
gradually developing into a great hate.

69
00:06:55,863 --> 00:07:00,616
Don't let this guy do your thinking.
You'll get a square deal from Stryker.

70
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:02,950
You bet. Square deal.

71
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,954
I'm looking forward to the first time
he and I come head to head off duty.

72
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:12,874
Hey, take it easy
with that hand, champ!

73
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,752
Saddle up!

74
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:10,327
- All right, take a break.
- Take a break.

75
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:19,458
- How does your squad look?
- See me in about six months. Conway!

76
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:29,798
I was checking the records.
Your father was Colonel Sam Conway.

77
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:35,301
- What if he was?
- I was with him ten months ago.

78
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,470
He was my CO before he got killed.

79
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,181
One of the best officers and finest men
I ever served under.

80
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,101
- I thought if you...
- Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

81
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:58,316
- For that, you sleep with your rifle.
- It was an accident.

82
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:01,819
- Nobody in this outfit drops their rifle.
- Fall in!

83
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:05,404
All right, saddle up. Pick it up.

84
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:10,658
Sometimes I don't know
which I hate worse, him or the Nips.

85
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:19,329
- Your father was a good marine.
- Until ten months ago.

86
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:25,000
- You shipped in when he was killed.
- I shipped in because I was expected to.

87
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:29,044
In war the men of my family
join the Marines.

88
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,213
I'm the last Conway, so here I am.

89
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:36,174
He'd be proud that
you're carrying on the tradition.

90
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:40,844
Not my father. He'd have expected me
to find some soft duty somewhere.

91
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:44,679
- In fact, he told me so.
- I don't get it.

92
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:49,892
I embarrassed my father. I wasn't
tough enough for him. Too soft.

93
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:55,644
"No guts" was the phrase he used.
He wanted me to be like Stryker.

94
00:09:55,853 --> 00:10:02,024
"The finest man I ever served under."
I bet they got along just fine.

95
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:07,819
Both with ramrods strapped on their
backs. I'm a civilian, not a marine.

96
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:12,198
They're not going to strap one on mine.
I'm in here strictly for tradition.

97
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,365
- That the only reason?
- Yeah. Why?

98
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:19,410
Nothing... Stryker knows his business.

99
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,870
So did Jack the Ripper.

100
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,082
Knock off the skylarking.
You're in the wrong column.

101
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,711
Left foot close in there.

102
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,670
Look alive!

103
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:52,640
Choynski, you're all left feet!

104
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:56,893
Choynski! What do you think
you're doing?

105
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:00,812
- Running the bayonet course, sir.
- Not in this league.

106
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,063
Yes, sir.

107
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:09,067
Your men are pretty ragged, Stryker.

108
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,318
Yes, sir.

109
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,531
That ought to take some starch
out of Stryker. His boys didn't do so well.

110
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:21,367
Hanging him up between those poles,
we'd do a lot better.

111
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,953
Choynski!

112
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,663
OK, so I'm left-handed.

113
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:31,957
- On guard. Give me your rifle.
- What is this?

114
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:36,876
You can't learn the easy way, you'll learn
the hard way. Make a thrust.

115
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:40,504
- Without a scabbard?
- You heard me.

116
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:45,298
- You mean this way?
- Yeah, like this!

117
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,678
You get the idea? Corpsman!

118
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,598
All right, saddle up.
We'll do it again. Pick it up.

119
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:08,939
You're the only unkissable guy in camp.

120
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:15,359
This thing hurts. It ain't funny. No dame's
going to come near a mouth like this.

121
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,654
Don't worry, I got the scoop.
No liberty for three months. You got time.

122
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:24,574
- Three months? How did you get that?
- I got spies everywhere.

123
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:28,452
They ought to throw the book at Stryker
for doing this.

124
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,871
They won't. They'll give him a citation
for teaching us to be good marines.

125
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,456
Choynski!

126
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:41,585
They tell me you're going to live.
You were lucky today.

127
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:47,380
Someone had been instructing you that
didn't like you, you might not have been.

128
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,592
You better put in a little homework
on that bayonet course.

129
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:59,513
Somebody who didn't like me? I wonder
what he does to the guys he hates.

130
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:06,809
365 days in a year and
I gotta pick this one to nick myself!

131
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,144
You need a blow torch on your stubble.

132
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,897
Look who's putting out the scuttlebutt.
No liberty, he says!

133
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:16,191
Somebody made a mistake.
You got no kick coming.

134
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,817
You have, so don't go turning your back.

135
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,198
Will we take Hollywood
with them physiques!

136
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:31,700
- First Platoon!
- That's for me!

137
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:38,080
- Here, Wright, any mail for Stryker?
- No.

138
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:40,456
It's going to be rugged again tonight.

139
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:43,750
He won't solve his problems
with whiskey.

140
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,044
What would you do
if your wife left with your kid?

141
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:51,380
- After five years I'd forget it.
- Stryker's not much on forgetting.

142
00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:01,386
- Sorry, no letter for you.
- I know it.

143
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:07,723
You know ten-year-olds. There could be
a thousand reasons why he didn't write.

144
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,141
- A million.
- Cut it out.

145
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,228
- Cut what out?
- Brushing me. The kid's all right.

146
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,647
- Maybe Mary influenced him not to.
- That she wouldn't do.

147
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:21,565
Of course not.

148
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:25,568
Stryker, you're a very unusual character.

149
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:28,862
- Can this be love?
- You know what I mean.

150
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:36,158
A lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman
needs a husband who's not always away.

151
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:41,537
A woman wants a home and a guy
to come in and out on time every day.

152
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:46,415
- You can tell me to shut up.
- If you can't talk to me, who can?

153
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:50,334
- Don't do it, just for once, don't do it.
- Do what?

154
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:55,462
Don't start out to get blind, staggering,
stinking, falling down drunk.

155
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:59,799
Nobody starts out to get blind,
staggering, stinking, falling down drunk.

156
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:03,092
Some do. Why not leave
half your dough with me?

157
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:07,178
You got an old maid's failings. You worry.

158
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:12,598
Don't try to follow me tonight or I'll put
a dent in that ugly head of yours.

159
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,767
- Ready?
- Just a minute.

160
00:15:16,976 --> 00:15:18,394
- What's up?
- Nothing.

161
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:23,063
Benny didn't strip his M1 fast enough
for Stryker, so he turned him in.

162
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,523
They cancelled his liberty.

163
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:32,194
Perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart
of gold after all, but he certainly is...

164
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:37,865
You talk too much. You think I restricted
Flynn for my own amusement?

165
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:44,286
The punishment's unreasonable,
to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake.

166
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:49,539
I'm gonna tell you something, Conway.
I'm gonna tell all of you.

167
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,541
I'm gonna make it simple
so you'll all understand it.

168
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,794
They handed me you guys as a present,
a regular Easter basket.

169
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:02,422
They told me to get you into shape
so you can handle a piece of this war.

170
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:09,344
That's what I'm gonna do and that means
I'm gonna tell you what to do every day,

171
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,387
how to button your buttons
and when to blow your noses.

172
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:19,350
If you do something I don't like I'm gonna
jump and when I land it'll hurt.

173
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:26,521
I'll ride you until you can't stand up.
When you do, you'll be marines.

174
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:29,606
Flynn stays here.

175
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:37,654
Extra-hard product of a hard school.
Tough luck, Flynn.

176
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:41,030
- If my brother doesn't go, I'm not going.
- Shut up!

177
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,740
- Who are you telling to shut up?
- You!

178
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:49,118
Let's go before we all lose our liberty.
I wanna see those Wellington babes.

179
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:17,220
- How do you feel, boy?
- Like a little bird with feathers on it.

180
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:22,598
- Don't fly away, little bird.
- I can't. I'm still in the egg.

181
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:28,394
Beautiful, beautiful! I wanna dance.

182
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,813
You're gonna sit down.

183
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,315
Yes, ma'am, Tennessee,
that's where I come from.

184
00:17:35,524 --> 00:17:39,859
The greatest state in the Union.
They call it the volunteer state.

185
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:46,489
Right there is where I'm from.
Smithville, Tennessee, what a town!

186
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:51,993
These are all my cousins on my mama's
side and these are on my papa's side.

187
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,995
We got the best tobacco there is, too.

188
00:17:55,203 --> 00:18:01,124
More fertiliser comes from Tennessee
than any other place in the world.

189
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,043
Listen to that band! Zombies!
They're all dead.

190
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,379
- Maybe they like music that way here.
- Or don't know any other kind.

191
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:15,549
- I'm talking these boys into a session.
- Maybe they don't have it in them.

192
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:19,343
After I'm through, they will.
They're breaking my heart.

193
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:22,637
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

194
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:38,731
- There is a happy man.
- Wait until tomorrow.

195
00:18:38,939 --> 00:18:43,109
- Don't be a killjoy, dance. I'll watch him.
- I'm not much on dancing.

196
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:47,028
- You might try just this once.
- No, thanks.

197
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,887
- Pete's my name, Pete Conway.
- Allison.

198
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:30,723
- Hello, Allison.
- Hello, Pete.

199
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:51,528
- You're warm. Want to sit down?
- No. I don't want to lose you.

200
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:54,821
- Cutting in.
- Shove off, Mac.

201
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,724
What would you say if I suggested
we get some air?

202
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:43,894
I'd say I'm not supposed to leave the club
with servicemen, but to you I'd say yes.

203
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:51,108
Now what?
We know all about each other.

204
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:56,528
- You'll be missing your train.
- I'll float back on thin air.

205
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,613
Don't do that. You might catch cold.

206
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:03,949
Funny, I've just met you and I feel
I've known you all my life.

207
00:21:04,158 --> 00:21:06,784
I feel that way, too.

208
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:10,662
- Ten thousand miles away.
- Not now.

209
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:14,039
I wanna see you again,
every time I get liberty.

210
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:17,749
I'll be here.

211
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,919
- Allison...
- Yes?

212
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:25,088
...l'm glad I met you tonight.

213
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,055
- The train...
- I know.

214
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,517
I'll walk you to the station.
I can get a taxi from there.

215
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,144
- No, I'll walk you home.
- No.

216
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:51,605
You might miss your train.
I might not see you again for a long time.

217
00:21:54,148 --> 00:22:00,319
Any time I get liberty, she says, just call
her up. Man, what a barmaid!

218
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:05,947
- I'll finish the war right here.
- Drink any more and you probably will!

219
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:12,327
New Zealand ain't got rats because
they killed them all with that whiskey!

220
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:15,204
We'll drink worse before we get through.

221
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:20,415
They may bury me at sea tomorrow,
but tonight I got that nice, warm feeling.

222
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:23,876
I got a great future
for the next two hours.

223
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,836
You're bleeding!

224
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,420
Lipstick!

225
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:31,672
- Hey, fellas, look what I found!
- Hey, sports...

226
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:34,883
...look.

227
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,178
- Boy, he's really carrying a load!
- Gyrene!

228
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:45,223
Hey, Mac, you're a little off your course.

229
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:51,352
- Well, what do you know! Stryker.
- He's sure a mess.

230
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,146
Now I know what happened
to those stripes. Come on.

231
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:04,109
Shore Patrol.

232
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:08,613
- That's what it is. Give me a hand.
- You're going to help him?

233
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:13,783
If he cut my mother's throat five minutes
ago, I wouldn't let them get him.

234
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:19,328
What a break! He's all set to drop two
stripes and Shore Patrol shows up.

235
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:25,499
- But look what he done to me!
- Don't tell me he kissed you.

236
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,458
That's a great one!

237
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:32,670
Did I tell you about the guy on a train
and the funniest thing happened...

238
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,506
- I don't know why you're helping him.
- I'll take care of it.

239
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:42,009
- Where did you come from?
- Never mind. He don't need you guys.

240
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:46,262
- How do you like that?
- He must follow Stryker like a little dog.

241
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,973
What do you care?
At least he took him off our hands.

242
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:58,186
A day after our leave, we drew a 22-mile
hike over terrain carefully selected.

243
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:03,481
All uphill, and it was a weary bunch of
marines who pitched tents that night

244
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,900
and gratefully folded themselves inside.

245
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:22,827
Do you believe in love at first sight?

246
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:25,620
All kinds.

247
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,373
I never did before but I sure do now.

248
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:36,627
- Why do you have to tell me now?
- Because I'm thinking about it now.

249
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:40,922
- I'm gonna marry that girl.
- What girl?

250
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,426
- The girl I met last night.
- You'll feel better in the morning.

251
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:51,262
I couldn't feel any better
than I do right now.

252
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:56,807
I've been thinking, why do men
get married during a war?

253
00:24:57,016 --> 00:25:01,518
- Don't know.
- It's the worst time.

254
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:06,438
I fooled around
but I never thought about marriage.

255
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:10,274
I know a lot of girls
back in the States but...

256
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:15,444
...I think it's because when you get
out here you're close to things.

257
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:20,363
You realise way down inside, no matter
how much you try not to think about it,

258
00:25:20,572 --> 00:25:24,784
that maybe something's
got your number on...

259
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,994
...and you want to leave
a bit of yourself behind.

260
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:35,332
Doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl,
just so long as you won't be forgotten.

261
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:41,044
There'll be someone who'd never
have lived if it hadn't been for you.

262
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:45,713
Am I right?

263
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,884
I think I'm right.

264
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:14,190
- Hey, Conway, got a pass?
- I have.

265
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,609
All right, hop in. I'll give you a lift.

266
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:30,951
- I hear you got a girl in town.
- What if I have?

267
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,037
- They say she's a very nice girl.
- They talk too much.

268
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:39,331
Are you serious about her?

269
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:47,753
With things the way they are, this is no
time to start getting serious with a girl.

270
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:52,881
Don't know how long you're gonna
be here or when you'll be back again.

271
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,675
Don't even know how long you'll live.

272
00:26:55,883 --> 00:27:00,178
If it's in the line of duty, you can tell me
to do something and I'll do it.

273
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:03,555
As for my personal life,
keep your hands off.

274
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:07,141
- Your father would've said it.
- I wouldn't have listened.

275
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,892
- You never did.
- How do you know?

276
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:13,770
- He told me.
- What did he say?

277
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:17,731
I'll tell you. He said
I was a disappointment, right?

278
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:21,900
He said I wouldn't be able
to stand up for myself, right?

279
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,611
- You're doing the talking.
- No, my father is.

280
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:30,865
Every time you open your mouth, he's
talking. Every thought you think is his.

281
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:34,408
It's as though he's at my shoulder.

282
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:38,786
But he didn't always say
or think the right thing.

283
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:45,665
You're gonna find that out when the
time comes. Until then leave me alone.

284
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,751
- You want a lift or not?
- Yeah, sure.

285
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:58,591
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?

286
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,886
- You've hardly said a word.
- You're right. I've been thinking.

287
00:28:04,094 --> 00:28:07,138
- About us?
- Myself.

288
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:09,556
That's selfish.

289
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:12,975
Honey, do you think I'm a brave man?

290
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:17,686
- What a funny question to ask.
- Well, do you?

291
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,938
I don't know. Why?

292
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:25,941
- I've got to prove something to someone.
- Who?

293
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,235
You don't know him. He's dead now.

294
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:34,405
Yes, Pete, I think you're brave.

295
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:38,741
That helps. You don't know
how much that helps.

296
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:41,993
Let's not talk about it any more.

297
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:47,455
We should have been talking about
ourselves all this time,

298
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:49,706
what's going to happen to us.

299
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:54,043
- What do you want to happen?
- I want to marry you.

300
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:57,003
I want that, too.

301
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:02,340
Funny, we barely know each other.

302
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:09,636
We see each other for what seems
only moments. And yet...

303
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:12,721
I know what you mean.

304
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,443
- Choynski, not going to the wedding?
- No.

305
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:41,490
I'd better get a transfer. I can't learn
this bayonet business. I'm all thumbs.

306
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,411
- On guard.
- No, Sarge, not again!

307
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:52,122
- I'm not well from the last time.
- On guard!

308
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:00,877
- Play that thing again. You lead.
- What?

309
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,130
You lead!

310
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:13,927
Shift your weight.

311
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:18,014
Left, left!

312
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,186
There. Keep it up.
You'll get the knack of it.

313
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:31,689
Practise that
about a half an hour every day.

314
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,705
Hey, Sarge! I got it!

315
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,715
I haven't been in church since I was 14.

316
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:16,843
- Kissing the bride's a great invention.
- Sure makes me homesick.

317
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:20,179
- What's the matter?
- He looks the same.

318
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:25,557
- How do you expect him to look?
- Married, wrinkled, worried, like me.

319
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:29,684
- 44 hours and 34 minutes left. Go!
- Excuse me, sports.

320
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:34,562
Here's your wedding present
from the gang.

321
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,981
You've all been wonderful.

322
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:41,192
- Are you sure you've got the right guy?
- I'm sure.

323
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,027
Come on, get going!

324
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:57,535
- "Sempre felice", Mac!
- Keep the situation well in hand, Pete!

325
00:31:57,744 --> 00:32:01,789
We got 44 hours and 33 minutes.
What are we gonna do?

326
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:04,958
Al, if I was a girl, I'd marry you.

327
00:32:05,165 --> 00:32:08,167
Knock it off! I've had a hard day.

328
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,752
What am I doing?

329
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,257
44 hours and 32 minutes.
That isn't very long, is it?

330
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:20,926
No, not long at all.

331
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:25,470
I wonder how many other people
have had 44 hours and 32 minutes.

332
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,514
Lots I guess.

333
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:32,642
- We'll make it seem a long time.
- Years.

334
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:45,525
- Shall I open it?
- Sure, go ahead.

335
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,449
They're in a hurry!

336
00:32:58,658 --> 00:33:00,951
Others were in a hurry.

337
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,289
The order said move out
and the Marines moved out.

338
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:11,750
11 days at sea. Destination?
Only the top brass knew.

339
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:17,670
Though, of course, scuttlebutt knew the
answer, a hundred answers, all wrong.

340
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:23,049
Boat Squad... halt, one, two!

341
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:27,093
Dismissed!

342
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,723
Too bad you couldn't see her again.
You didn't get long.

343
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:38,058
We knew it might happen.
I'll be back. I've got to believe that.

344
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,394
- Sure. We'll all be back.
- Gangway!

345
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:50,483
That's no way to carry a flag, Regazzi.
I've got to teach you everything.

346
00:33:50,692 --> 00:33:55,695
Now watch this...
What are you gonna do with this, Benny?

347
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:59,114
I'm gonna put that up in Tokyo,
right in the middle of Times Square.

348
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:06,243
- There isn't any Times Square in Tokyo.
- There will be when I get there.

349
00:34:06,452 --> 00:34:11,413
Now that's the way to fold a flag,
with the blue field showing.

350
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:13,664
What do you know!

351
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,169
- You got my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

352
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:23,671
- I'm telling you, it's my shirt!
- It's my shirt!

353
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:32,719
Here, fellas. You'd better
quit fighting so much.

354
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:36,012
If you don't, one of you's apt to get hurt.

355
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,515
Corpsman! Corpsman!

356
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:49,605
- What's that?
- Relax. It's the Navy clearing its throat.

357
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:52,398
Sure don't sound like no squirrel gun.

358
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:56,776
I hope they practise real good. What
island do you think we're aiming at?

359
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:59,027
We'll get word.

360
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:03,155
- Here it is.
- It looks like a pork chop.

361
00:35:03,364 --> 00:35:05,865
- What's its name?
- Tarawa.

362
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:08,575
Never heard of it. It's the wrong place.

363
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:11,702
It's part of an atoll called Tarawa Atoll.

364
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:16,539
This particular island is called Betio.
Don't ask me how you spell it.

365
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,874
You'll have to stick your faces into it
but you don't have to spell it.

366
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:26,461
- This is Red Beach Three. That's us.
- What have they got there?

367
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,798
Everything. This island's held
by a special naval landing force.

368
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:35,384
That means Japanese marines.
They're dug in and they're mean.

369
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:40,012
They'd just as soon die as stick a nickel
in a jukebox, but that's all right.

370
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,973
Let the other guy die for his country.
You'll live for yours.

371
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:50,519
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

372
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:53,521
- Get over there.
- I can hear him.

373
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:59,275
Get over there. I don't want anybody
hurt because you didn't listen.

374
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:30,377
- Schoolteacher, do me some homework.
- What's your problem, son?

375
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:34,964
Put down 5,000. Scuttlebutt says
that's how many Nips are on that rock.

376
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:39,508
- The Navy fired 1,000 tons of shells.
- Don't forget the fly-fly boys.

377
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:43,636
Those B-24s have really
been working them over.

378
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:48,431
Now add the tons of explosives, divide it
by the Nips and get the answer.

379
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,350
- Maybe we'll be back for noon chow.
- Don't figure that way.

380
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:58,479
The Navy and the fly-fly boys unloaded
plenty on the canal before we went in.

381
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:03,524
When we got ashore there were still a lot
of those lemon-coloured guys waiting.

382
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:09,236
Only way that island was taken
was by putting marines on the beach.

383
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:15,823
You've heard the naval foray's a waste
of time and metal. Stryker knows better.

384
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:21,327
- Who cut you in on this conversation?
- You say when I can and can't talk?

385
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:25,955
- Just when you can't talk to me.
- Knock it off, Conway.

386
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:29,916
I've had enough of your "hardbitten
sergeant" attitude.

387
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:35,085
You're so big everybody's been afraid
to take a punch at you. I'm not!

388
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,004
Cool off!

389
00:37:38,213 --> 00:37:44,425
Forget that pencil and paper routine and
worry about staying alive on that beach.

390
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:48,594
- Don't expect any soft touch!
- "Now hear this"!

391
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:52,931
All troops report
to your debarking stations!

392
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:41,504
All right, men, sound off
when your name's called.

393
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:45,131
Now hear this,
there'll be no movies tonight!

394
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:50,923
The place is opened up for business.

395
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:58,553
- Missed!
- Maybe they're firing blanks.

396
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:03,473
- Maybe a two-headed kid's aiming.
- Maybe this is just manoeuvres.

397
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:32,742
Get out now. We're crossing the line
of departure. Lock and load!

398
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:23,816
- Good luck, Sarge!
- Charlie, give me a hand here!

399
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:30,737
Lieutenant, hit the deck! How is it?

400
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,696
I got hit!

401
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:36,324
Corpsman! You'll be all right.

402
00:41:46,997 --> 00:41:51,251
They got us pinned down!
We can't get over these logs!

403
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:54,544
- I'm going while I can!
- Stay here, kid!

404
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,142
We're gonna be killed here.
I'd like to get at them!

405
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,018
Why rush? This is a nice place.

406
00:42:27,107 --> 00:42:31,234
- They got the lieutenant!
- They'll get all of us if we don't move.

407
00:42:31,443 --> 00:42:35,487
We are like fish in a barrel lying here.

408
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:43,075
- Did we train to take it lying down?
- Sarge, do something about it!

409
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:47,661
Stay where you are until I tell you.

410
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:57,209
You gotta get us out of here!

411
00:42:57,418 --> 00:43:01,962
If you're nervous count your toes.
I'll do the masterminding around here.

412
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:13,762
- Where's Lieutenant Baker?
- Machine-gunned.

413
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,765
- Is your squad all right?
- All but one. What's holding us down?

414
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:23,143
That bunker, an old power plant. All
these bombs and they're still killing us.

415
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:27,187
- Smoke, sir?
- Thanks.

416
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:32,106
I've sent for flame-throwers to assist.
Your squad will support. Follow me!

417
00:43:32,315 --> 00:43:35,525
You heard! Move out and stay down!

418
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:02,335
We've gotta silence that bunker!

419
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:27,434
Request naval gunfire
be lifted on target areas, coordinates...

420
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:32,437
...two-four-six-zero-sugar-tare. Over.

421
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,315
Roger and out.

422
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:55,494
Flame-throwers out! Demolition in!

423
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:34,769
Demolition out!

424
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:52,488
Shipley!

425
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,705
Give me a hand with this pack.

426
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:44,606
Throw it!

427
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:05,285
Move out!

428
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,989
Get him out of there!

429
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,581
- There goes one of your nine.
- Now we got tanks.

430
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:18,374
Better late than never.

431
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,625
Come on!

432
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:27,755
Corpsman! Corpsman! This way!

433
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:34,968
Don't wait. They'll find me.
Keep going. Hit 'em for me.

434
00:48:36,094 --> 00:48:39,054
Find Stryker. Stick with him.

435
00:48:40,138 --> 00:48:42,764
He's good people.

436
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:45,683
Tell him I...

437
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:32,421
I'd like to know
where the rest of the squad went.

438
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:36,424
- What's this place?
- Whatever it is it ain't healthy!

439
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,175
Let's go!

440
00:49:48,015 --> 00:49:51,684
That was close.
Next time don't be in such a hurry.

441
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:55,603
- You're across, ain't you?
- Across what? To where?

442
00:49:55,811 --> 00:50:00,356
- I'm running low on ammo.
- I am too.

443
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,692
Forgot about that.
We gotta get some more.

444
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,694
- I'll go.
- Wait! Pick a number from one to six.

445
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:11,280
- Two.
- Five.

446
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:14,532
You're both wrong.

447
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:26,873
That guy kills me.

448
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:39,173
Thomas better hurry!

449
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:51,806
- How about some bandoliers, Mac?
- Help yourself.

450
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,144
- How are things going up front?
- Pretty rough.

451
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:03,438
- Keep it coming.
- Good luck.

452
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:19,448
- Is that coffee?
- It sure is. Do you want some?

453
00:51:21,242 --> 00:51:24,326
Do I want some, he says!

454
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:30,455
I haven't had any joe
since we left the ship.

455
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:40,546
You mortarmen sure live
the life of Riley here.

456
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:42,797
Here you are.

457
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:50,677
Beautiful!

458
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:57,557
- Where's Thomas?
- Probably dead.

459
00:51:57,764 --> 00:52:00,892
No, not that guy. Let's get out of here!

460
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:26,533
- Can I have some for my buddies?
- Sure. Break out your canteen.

461
00:52:26,742 --> 00:52:30,453
Tell me, how's everything been going?

462
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:36,332
Couldn't be better, Mac.
Oh, this is the life!

463
00:52:41,835 --> 00:52:46,922
Come and get it, you guys!
Ammo and fresh hot joe!

464
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,464
Hellenopolis!

465
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,715
Bass!

466
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,650
Hey, Greek!

467
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:25,988
Hey, Greek!

468
00:53:28,782 --> 00:53:32,535
- What kepts you, Thomas?
- Where's Bass?

469
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,577
Gutted.

470
00:53:34,786 --> 00:53:37,162
No ammo.

471
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:40,915
What kept you, sports?

472
00:54:05,264 --> 00:54:07,306
Major Crowe, sir.

473
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:13,519
- Jim? How you doing?
- "It's tough going, Dave".

474
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:17,563
I've committed every man.
We're dug in and staying.

475
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:24,693
Good. I've been getting reports all day
that the Nips are slipping in to your front.

476
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:31,655
If it's "banzai" tonight,
target area 2-41 is a hot spot.

477
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:34,740
What outfit have you got there?

478
00:54:36,284 --> 00:54:38,743
Joyce and Stryker.

479
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:42,912
Pass the word they gotta dig in
and stay put.

480
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:45,622
No noise or movement.

481
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:53,086
Don't risk anybody unless you have to.
Hold on until we get more men there.

482
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,465
Yes, sir.

483
00:54:58,673 --> 00:55:03,176
Major Crowe says the Nips have been
filtering into these tank traps.

484
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:06,595
Disperse your squad along this section.

485
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:11,765
Tell your men there's to be no smoking,
no moving or unnecessary talking.

486
00:55:11,973 --> 00:55:16,100
If they find out how thin we are,
they can get to the beach.

487
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:21,271
That's a platoon area. All I got's
a beat-up squad, short three men.

488
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,564
- Couldn't you...?
- Can I give you three men?

489
00:55:24,773 --> 00:55:30,151
The battalion can't give the whole
company three replacements.

490
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:34,029
Your squad is covering
the hottest spot in the line.

491
00:55:34,237 --> 00:55:39,491
If it's an attack tonight they'll strike you
first. They want to know our disposition.

492
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:42,951
I repeat, your men are not to move.

493
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,455
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stryker, we're going to hold this line.

494
00:55:48,663 --> 00:55:52,166
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.

495
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:05,091
All right, saddle up. Follow me.

496
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:07,967
Everybody go!

497
00:56:13,096 --> 00:56:18,599
Drop off at intervals, two-man foxholes.
We're gonna be spread out thin tonight.

498
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:25,812
Don't give away your position or strength.
You Flynns stay here, and no quarrels.

499
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:32,608
Dunne and Smith, drop out here.

500
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:36,611
No gab tonight!

501
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,823
You and Harris here! Come on, Conway.

502
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,254
Corpsman!

503
00:57:05,462 --> 00:57:07,506
Listen.

504
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:14,135
- Corpsman!
- That's a marine.

505
00:57:17,387 --> 00:57:19,471
Corpsman!

506
00:57:23,516 --> 00:57:26,601
- Stryker!
- Get down and stay down!

507
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,270
- You had your orders!
- Somebody's wounded!

508
00:57:30,478 --> 00:57:32,771
- Quiet.
- Let's get him!

509
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,608
Stay down! It may be an old Jap trick.
They pulled it on the canal.

510
00:57:37,817 --> 00:57:44,487
- It doesn't sound like a Jap to me.
- I don't care. You'll tip our position.

511
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,657
Stryker!

512
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,618
It's Bass!
How many Japs know your name?

513
00:57:53,827 --> 00:57:55,911
- You know his voice.
- Shut up.

514
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:03,333
Aren't you human at all?
A friend of yours may be dying!

515
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,168
Knock it off!

516
00:58:05,376 --> 00:58:09,503
This is what my father taught you.
Be a great marine, be tough.

517
00:58:09,712 --> 00:58:15,215
Sit here if you want. I'm getting him.
The only way you'll stop me is to kill me.

518
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:18,259
That's just what I'll do!

519
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:41,066
Stryker!

520
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:44,651
Stryker!

521
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,283
Sarge!

522
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,619
Stryker!

523
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:06,874
Please, Sarge!

524
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:23,760
Tarawa was officially declared secure
at 13.30 on the fourth day of battle.

525
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:29,889
The replacements came ashore,
our wounded were cared for

526
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:33,808
and the assault troops were relieved.

527
00:59:43,398 --> 00:59:47,566
- How am I doing, Chaplain?
- God has been good to you.

528
00:59:47,775 --> 00:59:50,235
You're going home.

529
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:56,364
Per istam Sanctam Unctionem,
et suam piisimam,

530
00:59:56,572 --> 01:00:01,659
indulgeat tibi Dominus
"quidquid deliquisti. Amen".

531
01:00:27,759 --> 01:00:30,761
Somebody beat me to it.

532
01:01:15,123 --> 01:01:20,001
Skipper gave out some news.
Part of it's good, part of it's bad.

533
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:24,129
- They found Hellenopolis. He's dead.
- He was a good Greek.

534
01:01:24,338 --> 01:01:29,132
Choynski, Soames and Bass are on
a hospital ship Stateside-bound.

535
01:01:29,341 --> 01:01:32,426
- I wish I was with them.
- Let's get cleaned up.

536
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:36,762
Wash out those dungarees
and let's look like marines.

537
01:01:40,514 --> 01:01:43,391
You too, Thomas.

538
01:01:49,228 --> 01:01:51,355
- Dunne.
- Yeah?

539
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:59,401
I got a couple of bottles of sake
in my gear. Give it to the squad.

540
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:03,695
- Right.
- Tell them you got it off a dead Nip.

541
01:02:03,904 --> 01:02:07,281
Why don't you break down a little?

542
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:10,116
You got it off a dead Nip.

543
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,451
Aye, aye.

544
01:02:35,258 --> 01:02:39,719
- What's eating you?
- Know what Stryker plans tomorrow?

545
01:02:39,928 --> 01:02:44,222
Another squad problem
and I'm so tired of problems!

546
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,641
I'm tired of Stryker!
I'm also tired of beautiful Hawaii.

547
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,893
Me, too.

548
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:57,105
Hey, champ, what do you think
of beautiful Hawaii?

549
01:02:57,313 --> 01:03:03,609
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Clamming up again, ever since Tarawa.

550
01:03:03,818 --> 01:03:06,361
- Why the silence?
- Knock it off!

551
01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:11,698
- Hi! You got room for me?
- What do you know!

552
01:03:11,906 --> 01:03:14,783
- You got time off for good behaviour?
- Yeah.

553
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:19,119
- Where were you? Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah, nice place. Pretty nurses.

554
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:22,746
I'll give somebody $5
to shoot me in the foot.

555
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:25,915
- I'll do it for $2.50.
- You're too willing!

556
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:29,710
Some replacements out here
assigned to our squad.

557
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:33,628
We build up the joint
and they come and live in it.

558
01:03:33,837 --> 01:03:37,339
This is Stein and Fowler and McHugh.

559
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:42,634
He's Fowler. Mike McHugh, from Cedar
Rapids to see this war's over in a hurry.

560
01:03:42,843 --> 01:03:45,303
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

561
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:49,097
- How old?
- Well, eighteen... going on eighteen.

562
01:03:49,306 --> 01:03:52,391
We heard that the squad leader's tough.

563
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:58,020
- There are rumours to that effect.
- Tough sergeants roll off my knife!

564
01:03:58,227 --> 01:04:04,148
You're gonna find your first few days
with Sergeant Stryker very interesting.

565
01:04:04,356 --> 01:04:07,442
You new men come with me.

566
01:04:14,947 --> 01:04:19,325
- Attention!
- Charlie! How are you?

567
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:22,702
- Certified fit for duty, so the medics say.
- Good.

568
01:04:22,911 --> 01:04:26,370
The replacements came up with me.

569
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:29,039
They get younger all the time.

570
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:32,124
- Or we're getting older.
- Or both.

571
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:35,668
- I can stand having you back.
- I can stand being back.

572
01:04:35,877 --> 01:04:40,047
What happened to the squad, besides
the Greek, Shipley and Thomas?

573
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:43,882
Choynski...
Thomas? He never got a scratch.

574
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:48,843
- I was sure he got it.
- Why?

575
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:54,513
When we got stuck in a trench he went
back to get ammo. Never came back.

576
01:04:54,722 --> 01:04:59,476
How long between the time he went back
and you got overrun?

577
01:04:59,683 --> 01:05:02,228
About 40 minutes.

578
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:04,479
40 minutes?

579
01:05:05,729 --> 01:05:07,773
Stay here.

580
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:18,363
Thomas!

581
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:21,615
- Yeah?
- Outside.

582
01:05:31,371 --> 01:05:35,374
- What's that about?
- Don't ask me. I haven't any spies.

583
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,876
- That's far enough.
- What's this about?

584
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:42,503
Just that I hate your guts!

585
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:04,809
Get up.

586
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:10,813
You doped off and got one of my men
killed and one of them bayoneted!

587
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:14,148
- You haven't had enough. Get up!
- Stryker...

588
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:17,984
Attention! All right, break it up.

589
01:06:20,486 --> 01:06:24,572
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Stryker. Able Company, sir.

590
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,198
And you?

591
01:06:26,406 --> 01:06:30,784
Pfc Thomas. Able Company, sir.

592
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:36,163
This may take some explaining before
a court martial. Help that man up.

593
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:47,128
- You'll need medical attention.
- I'll be OK, sir.

594
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:52,923
That's debatable. You know it's not
permissible for an NCO to strike a man?

595
01:06:53,132 --> 01:06:55,800
- Yes, sir.
- Who struck the first blow?

596
01:06:58,677 --> 01:07:02,388
Colonel, there wasn't any first blow
struck exactly.

597
01:07:02,596 --> 01:07:05,681
A simultaneous explosion perhaps?

598
01:07:07,141 --> 01:07:11,268
Judo, sir. The sergeant was showing me
how to break a judo hold.

599
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:15,438
No more judo exhibitions.
Understand, Sergeant?

600
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,731
Aye, aye, sir.

601
01:07:26,653 --> 01:07:29,322
At least you're no stool pigeon.

602
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,073
Wait a minute, Stryker.

603
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:36,284
I'm wrong, dead wrong. I know it.

604
01:07:37,535 --> 01:07:42,288
I doped off for some coffee,
but I didn't think a few minutes mattered.

605
01:07:42,497 --> 01:07:46,583
- It did!
- I know that now, but I didn't then.

606
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:49,293
It's killing me. I can't sleep.

607
01:07:49,502 --> 01:07:55,671
A hundred times I wanted to tell you,
tell somebody. I...

608
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,675
I liked that Greek...
I'd do anything for him.

609
01:08:02,092 --> 01:08:06,638
If I could I'd change him
for me right now.

610
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:09,847
I think you would.

611
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:16,560
Guys make mistakes but every one
we make, a stack of chips goes with it.

612
01:08:16,769 --> 01:08:20,896
We make a mistake
and some guy don't walk away!

613
01:08:21,104 --> 01:08:24,232
For evermore he don't walk away.

614
01:08:25,608 --> 01:08:29,360
I guess all we can do is just take it...

615
01:08:30,653 --> 01:08:35,322
...and hope we don't make
the same mistake again.

616
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:37,366
I won't.

617
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,870
Let's get back.

618
01:08:48,664 --> 01:08:51,333
Mail call! First Platoon.

619
01:08:56,628 --> 01:09:00,964
A letter from my wife after 18 months.
Know where she is?

620
01:09:01,172 --> 01:09:03,841
In England, entertaining troops.

621
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:09,678
Entertaining troops? Why isn't she here
entertaining me? I'm a troop.

622
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:15,682
"They're all such nice boys. There's
a lieutenant here..." A lieutenant!

623
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:22,310
When I get back she'll need standing
up for a month! I put on muscle lately!

624
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:32,693
Darling, this is a funny way for a man
to find out he's a father, but you are.

625
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:37,779
It happened the day before yesterday,
just in time for breakfast.

626
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:42,532
He's a boy and looks beautiful like me
and intelligent like you.

627
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:49,620
I should have told you it was going to
happen, but I didn't want to worry you.

628
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:54,582
I don't know what to call him.
We never discussed that.

629
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,917
- I'm a father! Hey, I'm a father!
- Let's see!

630
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:03,796
- I'm a father!
- All right, let's fall in!

631
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,466
Come on!

632
01:10:14,303 --> 01:10:18,638
Finally we got our leave.
Ten days in Honolulu.

633
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:23,100
All of us were out on the town.
All except Stryker.

634
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:26,019
He was still the same.

635
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:49,658
- Lonesome?
- Drift.

636
01:10:54,828 --> 01:10:57,538
- Whiskey.
- Two?

637
01:10:57,747 --> 01:11:02,084
- Please.
- OK.

638
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:07,295
Thanks. A drink'll be good. I'm tired.
It's been a rough day...

639
01:11:07,504 --> 01:11:10,130
Knock it off!

640
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:13,216
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

641
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:20,553
- Right.
- Thanks.

642
01:11:21,638 --> 01:11:26,307
65 cents for a drink. It's too much.
They cheat servicemen.

643
01:11:28,308 --> 01:11:31,060
We could drink cheaper at my house.

644
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:34,062
Don't throw your arm out of joint.

645
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:43,026
Thanks for the drink. I didn't mean
to make too much buzzing in your ear.

646
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:46,112
It's all right, finish your drink.

647
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:57,327
- I didn't mean to sound so tough.
- I know. You're just unhappy.

648
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:04,082
Me, too.

649
01:12:05,332 --> 01:12:07,417
My name's Mary.

650
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:13,629
The long arm of coincidence,
or something.

651
01:12:14,839 --> 01:12:16,881
Her name, too.

652
01:12:19,925 --> 01:12:22,927
That invitation still hold?

653
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:39,479
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll fix us a drink.

654
01:12:47,401 --> 01:12:51,778
Oh, dear!
Well, I can get us some more in a jiffy.

655
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,202
I see.

656
01:13:04,162 --> 01:13:06,872
Will a sawbuck do it?

657
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:11,083
Go on, take it. It's only paper.

658
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,669
Well, I'll be right back.

659
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:27,131
- I hope this is your brand.
- Any brand is mine.

660
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:44,893
- She says she's hungry.
- He.

661
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:50,188
Advise him against joining the Marines.

662
01:14:56,943 --> 01:15:03,279
Mummy's fixing you something. Her
boy'll be quiet while she has company.

663
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:07,992
Knock it off...
Where's his father?

664
01:15:09,367 --> 01:15:11,410
Gone.

665
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:18,999
Well, I guess into each life
a little rain must fall.

666
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:29,630
There are a lot tougher ways
of making a living than going to war.

667
01:15:36,509 --> 01:15:39,803
You know about babies.

668
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:44,598
Yeah, I know about babies.

669
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:07,821
So long, Mac.

670
01:16:13,325 --> 01:16:17,870
- Wait!
- I can't spend it on a coral reef.

671
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:23,915
- You're a very good man.
- You'll get odds on that in the Marines.

672
01:16:24,123 --> 01:16:26,167
So long.

673
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,878
So long, Sergeant. I'll pray for you.

674
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,547
Let's not get religion.

675
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:38,424
- I'll pray for you, Sergeant!
- Good luck.

676
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:46,971
You got a lot of bloodhound in you,
Charlie, but you can call off the dogs.

677
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,973
I'm smarter than I was 30 minutes ago.

678
01:16:50,182 --> 01:16:53,225
Catch me feeling sorry for myself again

679
01:16:53,434 --> 01:16:56,728
and you got my permission
to belt me in the nose!

680
01:16:56,937 --> 01:17:00,688
- Buy you a drink?
- Lock and load, boy!

681
01:17:08,944 --> 01:17:11,112
- Thanks!
- Two bourbon and ice.

682
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,326
- A baby's a big event.
- Conway!

683
01:17:23,411 --> 01:17:27,206
- Treating the boys?
- Crack open the hatch!

684
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:33,085
That's great. A fellow always gets
more kick out of a boy, I guess.

685
01:17:33,293 --> 01:17:36,920
I got a kid. Sam, I named him...

686
01:17:39,546 --> 01:17:41,590
...after your old man.

687
01:17:41,799 --> 01:17:46,009
Wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't
write. You'll be mad enough to hit him.

688
01:17:46,218 --> 01:17:51,513
No, I won't, Stryker, because he won't
have to write. I'll be where he is.

689
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:56,557
And I won't insist that he be tough.
I'll try to make him intelligent.

690
01:17:56,766 --> 01:18:02,478
And I won't insist that he read the Marine
Corps manual. I'll get him Shakespeare.

691
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:06,439
I don't want him to be a Colonel Conway
or Sergeant Stryker.

692
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:12,068
I want him to be intelligent, considerate,
cultured and a gentleman.

693
01:18:12,277 --> 01:18:15,695
- You're out of line, kid.
- Let him be. He has a right to dislike me.

694
01:18:15,903 --> 01:18:19,447
Thanks, and I intend
to exercise that right.

695
01:18:19,656 --> 01:18:24,993
- I don't like you, Stryker.
- Let's talk sense for a minute, Conway.

696
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:28,120
I can't have friction in the squad.

697
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:34,207
I've tried every approach to you that I
know. Got nowhere. You're intelligent...

698
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:39,043
Don't patronise me. Your opinion of
my IQ doesn't interest me in the least.

699
01:18:39,252 --> 01:18:45,214
Let's get this straight.
On duty I jump when you holler.

700
01:18:45,423 --> 01:18:49,758
Off duty I exercise my God-given rights
under a democracy

701
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:52,802
and dislike whom I please.

702
01:18:54,053 --> 01:18:57,139
Do we understand each other?

703
01:19:03,642 --> 01:19:07,270
- Beat it.
- Come on, you guys, let's go.

704
01:19:18,903 --> 01:19:21,988
I don't understand
why you don't belt him.

705
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:26,157
- Mellow in my old age, I guess.
- Too bad.

706
01:19:26,365 --> 01:19:29,284
"Screaming Sam"
couldn't be proud of him.

707
01:19:29,492 --> 01:19:35,121
He could. There's something inside
a guy, always proud of a kid.

708
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,915
- Two more?
- Not for me.

709
01:19:38,123 --> 01:19:41,167
- I'll sail again. One.
- OK.

710
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:44,794
- Maybe you can steer me home?
- Charge!

711
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:49,964
Pull pins!

712
01:19:50,173 --> 01:19:52,257
Prepare to throw!

713
01:19:52,466 --> 01:19:54,508
Throw!

714
01:20:00,804 --> 01:20:04,182
- All right, fifth relay!
- What an arm!

715
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:06,975
Pick it up!

716
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:09,810
Right in the groove!

717
01:20:10,019 --> 01:20:13,395
- Look, boy, this is a live grenade.
- Gee!

718
01:20:13,604 --> 01:20:17,315
- You know what they can do?
- Yes, sir.

719
01:20:17,523 --> 01:20:23,736
Right hand. Wait for the order
to pull pin and pitch grenade.

720
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,862
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

721
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,113
Ready?

722
01:20:29,573 --> 01:20:31,574
Pull pin!

723
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:34,243
Prepare to throw!

724
01:20:34,451 --> 01:20:36,953
Throw!

725
01:20:39,412 --> 01:20:42,039
Grenade! Hit the deck!

726
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:54,548
When will you wake up? You wanna see
her again, keep your mind on your work!

727
01:20:54,756 --> 01:20:58,925
- What happened here?
- Little accident, sir.

728
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:02,177
You're wounded. Corpsman!

729
01:21:02,386 --> 01:21:05,555
- Yes, sir.
- Take care of the sergeant.

730
01:21:05,763 --> 01:21:08,848
Come right over here, Sergeant.

731
01:21:10,015 --> 01:21:14,143
You may not know it,
but you just got your life saved.

732
01:21:14,352 --> 01:21:16,395
You'll get a medal.

733
01:21:18,688 --> 01:21:21,940
Again the word came
and the Marines moved out.

734
01:21:22,148 --> 01:21:26,276
Again scuttlebutt knew a hundred
destinations, all wrong.

735
01:21:26,484 --> 01:21:30,696
This time we were a sound fighting unit,
blooded and trained.

736
01:21:30,904 --> 01:21:34,781
Tarawa had blooded us.
Stryker had trained us.

737
01:21:45,872 --> 01:21:50,584
- Now, I'll show you something.
- What you got there?

738
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:52,960
- What does it look like?
- A flag.

739
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:58,338
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Occupy this island in the USA's name.

740
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:02,757
- You think we'll have an easy time?
- You got me with you.

741
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:07,760
- Maybe we need two of you.
- One was enough in Tarawa.

742
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:11,680
Stick with me.
I'm a battle-hardened veteran.

743
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:17,726
Know how many Japs I knocked off
in Tarawa? 32. Did I get anything for it?

744
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:20,769
I got enemies in Washington.

745
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:24,688
If the Marines didn't have me,
they'd never have made it.

746
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:28,733
Now, this is how you fold a flag!

747
01:22:31,902 --> 01:22:34,778
Do you believe in intuition?

748
01:22:34,987 --> 01:22:38,655
Yeah... in women. Why?

749
01:22:38,864 --> 01:22:43,242
It's hard to explain. I've a feeling
I'm not coming out of this operation.

750
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:45,994
Don't talk that way.

751
01:22:46,203 --> 01:22:49,746
- I can't help it. It's the way I feel.
- Why?

752
01:22:49,954 --> 01:22:54,541
I don't know. It's like a voice in my ear.
I can't shake the feeling off.

753
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,418
Take my advice, shake it off.

754
01:22:57,627 --> 01:23:03,880
No dice. When things like that get in you,
it's no use trying to fight them.

755
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:14,762
If a marine waits long enough
he gets the word.

756
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:19,098
Our sealed orders came aboard
after five days at sea.

757
01:23:21,225 --> 01:23:24,143
This island is volcanic and sandy.

758
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:28,896
It's five and a half miles long
and two and a half miles wide.

759
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:34,149
This mountain here
is a dead volcano. It's called Suribachi.

760
01:23:34,358 --> 01:23:40,195
There's nothing on the island except
three airfields and about 20,000 Japs.

761
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:46,616
The Army Air Corps B-24s have been
bombing this place for 62 days.

762
01:23:46,825 --> 01:23:51,369
- Maybe it'll be an easy operation then.
- We can't be sure.

763
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:55,038
Every yard is covered
by some kind of fire.

764
01:23:55,247 --> 01:24:01,501
There are two possible landing beaches,
one on the east side, one on the west.

765
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:05,169
The rest of the coastline is cliffs.

766
01:24:05,378 --> 01:24:07,505
They'll try and keep us off the beaches.

767
01:24:07,712 --> 01:24:11,757
If they don't, they'll try and catch us
at this first airfield,

768
01:24:11,966 --> 01:24:17,177
between the heights of Suribachi
and these high rocky ridges in the north.

769
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:23,473
They'll shell us from both sides. Nobody
knows what they've got on this island.

770
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:26,809
But they've had 40 years to put it there.

771
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:32,728
Saipan was our last stop.

772
01:24:32,937 --> 01:24:37,524
The men who were going to hit
the beach first transferred to LS Ts.

773
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:41,985
A few more days at sea
and the time for landing came.

774
01:25:27,973 --> 01:25:29,474
Saddle up!

775
01:25:29,682 --> 01:25:32,768
Skip along and into the amtracs.

776
01:26:31,514 --> 01:26:34,682
Anyway, it's a good day for it.

777
01:26:34,891 --> 01:26:37,935
- It's cold.
- Stick around, it'll get warm.

778
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:41,937
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
Hey, look!

779
01:26:46,981 --> 01:26:51,944
- Driver, you the joker that wrote that?
- "Semper fi", Mac!

780
01:26:52,152 --> 01:26:55,237
We should take you in along with us.

781
01:26:57,197 --> 01:27:02,826
Hey, McHugh's going in with his pocket
full of books! Five books he's got!

782
01:27:03,034 --> 01:27:06,953
So? The kid's a reader.
That shouldn't worry a dope like you.

783
01:27:07,161 --> 01:27:12,581
When we're through with this operation,
I'm gonna break both your legs!

784
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:32,136
- I feel sick.
- I know. I felt the same way at Tarawa.

785
01:27:32,344 --> 01:27:35,596
Hey, Stein, "Shalom aleychem".

786
01:27:35,805 --> 01:27:38,557
Aleychem shalom.

787
01:27:41,392 --> 01:27:45,103
- Sarge, I'm scared.
- So am I.

788
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:50,231
- Not you!
- Fowler, I'm always scared.

789
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,358
Line of departure! Get down!

790
01:27:53,567 --> 01:27:58,820
Lock and load! Drop those lifebelts
when we hit the beach!

791
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:49,227
All right, hit the beach!

792
01:29:31,837 --> 01:29:33,798
It ain't Brooklyn!

793
01:29:34,006 --> 01:29:38,300
If this place was a blanket
I'd pull it over my head!

794
01:29:38,509 --> 01:29:43,720
This is the poorest soil I ever saw. What
does anyone want an island like this for?

795
01:29:43,929 --> 01:29:45,971
- That's war.
- What's war?

796
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,390
Trading real estate for men.

797
01:29:48,598 --> 01:29:54,727
When God made the world, he must
have put all the rubbish left over here.

798
01:29:54,936 --> 01:29:58,021
Corpsman! Corpsman! Take it easy.

799
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:03,191
Doggone it, almost the same place
they got me before!

800
01:30:04,818 --> 01:30:06,860
Getting shot for this!

801
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:11,571
They're sure pouring it into Suribachi.

802
01:30:17,325 --> 01:30:22,286
Not enough. Those Nips
are shooting right down our throats.

803
01:30:22,495 --> 01:30:25,747
- Stryker!
- Yo!

804
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:32,460
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.
- Lieutenant Shrier?

805
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:35,587
Stand fast.

806
01:30:48,762 --> 01:30:51,306
- Stryker reporting, sir.
- I know.

807
01:30:51,514 --> 01:30:55,850
Your platoon's been hit hard.
What's left has been assigned to me.

808
01:30:56,058 --> 01:31:00,145
- Yes, sir.
- Naval gunfire lifts at 1100. Stand by.

809
01:31:00,353 --> 01:31:01,687
Aye, aye.

810
01:31:23,993 --> 01:31:26,369
Move out!

811
01:31:26,578 --> 01:31:29,413
Keep your distance!

812
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:15,022
- Go on, go on!
- Corpsman! Corpsman! Corpsman!

813
01:33:18,066 --> 01:33:20,943
Spread out! Dig in!

814
01:33:29,949 --> 01:33:34,910
- Dunne, where's my brother?
- Back there. He's hit.

815
01:33:38,663 --> 01:33:39,998
Flynn!

816
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:51,963
That's enough!

817
01:33:57,341 --> 01:34:02,886
I told you you'd need this bad
some day. Thanks, Marine.

818
01:34:10,225 --> 01:34:12,268
Flynn! Get down!

819
01:34:15,186 --> 01:34:22,107
- You ain't got the sense of a rabbit!
- You can still be a hero crawling!

820
01:34:22,316 --> 01:34:27,194
- Corpsman!
- Ma'll dust me off if I don't get him back!

821
01:34:29,362 --> 01:34:31,447
Harris!

822
01:34:34,824 --> 01:34:38,910
Well, I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.

823
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:41,329
Corpsman!

824
01:34:41,537 --> 01:34:43,914
He won't need him.

825
01:34:59,715 --> 01:35:03,468
- Pillbox too big to handle with these.
- A bazooka?

826
01:35:03,676 --> 01:35:09,305
- If we had one.
- I got nothing to do. I'll go pick one up.

827
01:35:47,371 --> 01:35:49,455
Regazzi didn't make it.

828
01:35:49,664 --> 01:35:52,999
You never know what's happening.

829
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:55,292
Listen.

830
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,587
- It's a tank.
- Yeah, but whose?

831
01:36:03,339 --> 01:36:04,674
Ours!

832
01:36:26,688 --> 01:36:29,147
It's Regazzi.

833
01:36:49,995 --> 01:36:52,912
Pillbox at 2 o'clock.

834
01:36:57,875 --> 01:37:00,835
OK, give 'em a hot foot!

835
01:37:13,259 --> 01:37:15,302
Thanks, Mac.

836
01:37:21,264 --> 01:37:26,185
- I couldn't find a bazooka.
- You did all right. Saddle up!

837
01:37:59,789 --> 01:38:05,876
No one had ever seen anything like it.
No one would have believed it possible.

838
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:09,212
That smoking, miserable, bloody island.

839
01:38:16,133 --> 01:38:20,302
After three days and three nights,
and at the end of that time,

840
01:38:20,511 --> 01:38:26,431
we'd barely reached the foot of
Suribachi, where we were the first day.

841
01:38:32,018 --> 01:38:35,521
- We'll sack here for the night.
- Best news today.

842
01:38:35,729 --> 01:38:40,482
Pair off and one man awake at all times.
Keep alert. Let's go.

843
01:38:51,614 --> 01:38:54,741
It'll start getting rough tomorrow
against Suribachi.

844
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:59,536
It started getting rough
when you put on that uniform.

845
01:38:59,744 --> 01:39:03,080
You wanna see a good-looking kid?

846
01:39:04,455 --> 01:39:07,165
Husky little boot. What's his name?

847
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:11,836
We're gonna name him Sam,
Sam Conway.

848
01:39:12,044 --> 01:39:17,214
A name that's been awarded the Navy
Cross is good enough for any kid.

849
01:39:17,422 --> 01:39:22,801
There's something I've been trying
to say but... I can't find the words.

850
01:39:23,009 --> 01:39:28,138
Two universities and you can't find
the words to say you were out of line?

851
01:39:28,346 --> 01:39:33,850
- OK, I'm out of line.
- No, you were. There's a difference.

852
01:39:36,893 --> 01:39:41,688
We'd better get some sack time.
Wanna sleep first or watch?

853
01:39:41,896 --> 01:39:44,565
- I'll watch.
- OK.

854
01:39:48,859 --> 01:39:53,237
Everybody gets out of line
once in a while.

855
01:39:55,113 --> 01:39:56,739
Thanks, gyrene.

856
01:40:00,032 --> 01:40:02,577
Where's Sergeant Stryker?

857
01:40:02,784 --> 01:40:05,578
- Stryker?
- Right there.

858
01:40:08,413 --> 01:40:12,374
- What do you want?
- Lieutenant Shrier wants to see you.

859
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:17,419
- Stryker, sir.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:40:17,627 --> 01:40:19,962
I'm taking a patrol up Suribachi.

861
01:40:20,171 --> 01:40:23,590
Get your men squared away
and be ready at 0700.

862
01:40:23,798 --> 01:40:28,050
- The rendezvous is that Nip tank there.
- Aye, aye, sir, 0700.

863
01:40:37,849 --> 01:40:41,976
That little voice whispering
in your ear again?

864
01:40:42,185 --> 01:40:46,897
Don't worry. I've known
a million guys that have heard it.

865
01:40:47,105 --> 01:40:52,275
Most of them make it. A few don't.
The percentage is on your side.

866
01:40:52,484 --> 01:40:56,402
- Did you ever hear it?
- No.

867
01:40:56,611 --> 01:41:00,739
- Don't you ever worry about it?
- What good would it do?

868
01:41:00,947 --> 01:41:04,866
- You're indestructible.
- Stick close. It might rub off!

869
01:41:05,075 --> 01:41:06,743
I'll do that.

870
01:41:06,951 --> 01:41:13,371
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Patrol is
ready to move. Request supporting fire.

871
01:42:46,223 --> 01:42:47,598
Ow!

872
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:34,504
Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai elohenu...
Adonai echad.

873
01:43:36,005 --> 01:43:38,048
Amen.

874
01:44:29,289 --> 01:44:31,415
Radio!

875
01:44:34,417 --> 01:44:37,836
Banner Three, this is Easy Five. Over.

876
01:44:38,045 --> 01:44:43,548
This is Easy Five. Cease fire,
we're preparing to move over the top.

877
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,387
- Roger and out. Stryker!
- Yes, sir.

878
01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:54,931
Colonel's ordered that we put up this flag
when the top's secure. Get it there.

879
01:44:55,139 --> 01:44:57,391
Aye, aye, sir.

880
01:45:00,559 --> 01:45:02,644
What is this?

881
01:45:02,852 --> 01:45:06,438
Put yours away.
This is the one we're gonna use.

882
01:45:06,647 --> 01:45:12,401
First squad. Find something we can use
as a standard and we'll put this up.

883
01:45:19,238 --> 01:45:23,366
- Conway, you made it.
- I guess that little voice was wrong.

884
01:45:23,574 --> 01:45:26,576
- I feel better.
- I feel better, too.

885
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:30,537
I never felt so good in my life.
How about a cigarette?

886
01:45:47,006 --> 01:45:49,590
- Is he...?
- Yeah.

887
01:45:49,799 --> 01:45:54,052
If he had to get it
it's the way he'd have wanted.

888
01:45:59,389 --> 01:46:02,349
It's a letter to his kid.

889
01:46:10,563 --> 01:46:16,442
"Dear son, I guess none of my letters
have reached you.

890
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:19,444
"I thought I'd try again as I'm feeling

891
01:46:19,652 --> 01:46:24,864
"that this may be the last
time I can write you.

892
01:46:25,947 --> 01:46:29,783
"For a long time
I've wanted to tell you many things.

893
01:46:29,992 --> 01:46:32,368
"Now that you're a big boy, I will.

894
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:36,371
"If we'd been together even for a while,

895
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:42,416
"I could've explained many things
much better than writing them.

896
01:46:42,625 --> 01:46:48,587
"You've gotta take care of your mother,
and love her and make her happy.

897
01:46:48,795 --> 01:46:51,922
"Never hurt her or anyone as I did.

898
01:46:54,132 --> 01:46:57,468
"Always do what your heart
tells you is right.

899
01:46:57,676 --> 01:47:03,055
"Maybe someone will write you some day
and tell you about me.

900
01:47:03,263 --> 01:47:09,601
"I want you to be like me in some
things, but not like me in others.

901
01:47:09,809 --> 01:47:15,480
"When you grow older and get to know
more about me, you'll see I've failed...

902
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,565
"...in many ways.

903
01:47:19,774 --> 01:47:24,735
"This isn't what I wanted
but things just turned out that way.

904
01:47:24,944 --> 01:47:28,196
"If there was only more time I..."

905
01:47:32,074 --> 01:47:34,492
Guess he never finished it.

906
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:46,457
I'll finish it for him.

907
01:47:54,963 --> 01:47:57,465
There she goes.

908
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,586
All right, saddle up!
Let's get back in the war!
