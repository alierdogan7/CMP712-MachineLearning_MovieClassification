1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,810
Previously on The Book of Negroes...

2
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:05,491
My name is Samuel Frances,
but you can call me Black Sam.

3
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:08,413
Oh! It's war now,

4
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:09,681
and we shall have freedom!

5
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:14,053
If you escape now, Lindo won't
have time to hunt you down.

6
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:17,121
- What will you do now that you are free of Lindo?
- Canvas Town.

7
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,956
I will stay among the Negroes there.

8
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,427
- You know this man?
- Sam was a friend when I needed one.

9
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:25,430
The British promise liberty. I will
fight for my freedom like any man.

10
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:27,104
The British just surrendered in Yorktown.

11
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,067
Solomon Lindo will be coming back for you.

12
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:50,353
Rebels exalted over the British
surrender, but for those who had

13
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,790
taken our freedom back, the
peace treaty spelled disaster.

14
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:57,163
American slaveholders and
their agents prowled Manhattan,

15
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,367
grabbing fugitives whenever they could.

16
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,336
My thoughts went to Solomon Lindo.

17
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,005
Would he return to New
York to try to claim me

18
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,674
and take me back to Charleston?

19
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,711
"All prisoners on both
sides shall be set at liberty

20
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:16,048
and His Britannic Majesty
shall, with all convenient speed

21
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:19,419
and without causing any
destruction or carrying away...

22
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:22,087
any Negroes,

23
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:25,991
or other property of American inhabitants,

24
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:28,327
withdraw all his armies,

25
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,862
garrison, and fleets from
the said United States."

26
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,565
Uh, Miss Meena? What do "carry away

27
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,201
any Negroes or other property" mean?

28
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,337
Black folks helped the British.

29
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,071
We up and fought and died for them.

30
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:44,309
It means the Americans are free
to re-enslave runaway slaves.

31
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:46,311
What did I tell you about the British?

32
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,279
Bounty hunters be all over
the city, snatching Negroes,

33
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:50,214
dragging them down South.

34
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,216
It's downright dangerous
now to be in New York.

35
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,218
And even more dangerous to leave.

36
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:56,154
I am a freeborn woman,

37
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:58,556
but most of us be runaway slaves.

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,558
No Racine plantation owner

39
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,560
is gonna separate me from my kinfolk.

40
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,762
General Washington

41
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:07,598
gave the Redcoats until the
end of November to evacuate.

42
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:11,069
Now, New York is the only place
still occupied by the British.

43
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,203
Until they leave completely,

44
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:15,205
you will still have some protection.

45
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,809
No. Let's protect ourselves,
protect our families.

46
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,845
Let's set up patrols,

47
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,747
look out for intruders, white or black.

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,588
This is what we must do.

49
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,970
Off to Sam's tavern?

50
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:51,140
No. I'm going to Holy Ground.

51
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:53,983
- There's a woman there in need.
- I will come with you.

52
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:54,984
No.

53
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:57,814
- There's no need for that.
- Kidnappers are everywhere.

54
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:00,249
I saw two white men
lurking around last night.

55
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:03,452
Bounty hunters, I suspect.

56
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,224
Everyone knows me

57
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,259
in Holy Ground.

58
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:14,997
I'll be fine.

59
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,870
Make sure you're back before nightfall.

60
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:28,010
I will. I'll be fine.

61
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,505
Let me go!

62
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,803
- Where are your freedom papers?
- What?

63
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:49,764
You can come with us polite,
or we can make it hard on you.

64
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,832
Ruffian!

65
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,802
Let her go or I shoot.

66
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:02,610
The next one will go
straight into your brain.

67
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:04,612
I am authorised to pick up

68
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:06,981
- runaway slaves.
- And I'm authorised to shoot.

69
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:10,850
Let her go now.

70
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:14,388
You heard the man.

71
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,800
- Are you all right, Miss Diallo?
- I'll be all right.

72
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,302
I went looking for you in Canvas Town.

73
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,671
I was told you were here, in Holy Ground.

74
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,940
I no longer work for
you, Lieutenant Waters.

75
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:37,043
It is not what you think.

76
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,913
My captain would like to meet

77
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,048
the famous One-Pound Meena.

78
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,095
Aminata Diallo.

79
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,397
I've been meaning to
meet you for some time.

80
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,399
Thank you,

81
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,103
lieutenant. You may go.

82
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,873
Do you have your freedom?

83
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:21,743
I have been free in New York

84
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:23,878
for eight years now.

85
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:27,014
They tell me that you can read and write,

86
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,050
keep ledgers,

87
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:31,786
and that you speak two African languages.

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,455
- Yes.
- Are you familiar

89
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:37,391
with section seven of the
provisional peace treaty?

90
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:41,129
I've taught it to half of Canvas Town.

91
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:43,297
The Negroes feel betrayed by it.

92
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,567
But if they served for the
British for one year minimum,

93
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:50,003
then they've already been liberated.

94
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:53,041
Do the British aim to keep
their promise to the Negroes?

95
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,077
Our Navy plans to move all Negro Loyalists
to Nova Scotia, where they will be free.

96
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:59,913
Nova Scotia? Not London?

97
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:02,182
Nova Scotia's a British colony.

98
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:05,718
In this Nova Scotia, will we be free?

99
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:08,889
Entirely, yes.

100
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,958
But before long, there will be hard work.

101
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:14,194
The Negroes will be given
land and expected to farm it.

102
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,529
Why have you brought me
here, Captain Clarkson?

103
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:19,732
Miss Diallo,

104
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,001
I want you

105
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:24,003
to spread the word

106
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,306
among your people.

107
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,510
We need help to register the Negroes.

108
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:33,579
I'd like to engage you, if you agree,

109
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:37,049
to collect names and ages and how
they came to serve the British.

110
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,186
We need to know how many wish to travel,

111
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,190
and we need to begin
embarkations almost immediately.

112
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:47,492
If you agree, you'll be paid
one pound a week in silver.

113
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,594
There will be constant work

114
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,964
and all the information
will be kept in a ledger.

115
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,965
What will this ledger be called?

116
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,835
The Book of Negroes.

117
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:02,974
I do want to go to this
Nova Scotia. With my husband.

118
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,445
Consider passage guaranteed
for the two of you.

119
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,914
You have my word, Miss Diallo.

120
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,916
Then I accept.

121
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:14,685
Excellent.

122
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,758
And I would like a map of Africa.

123
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,793
Your maps are terrible.

124
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:33,571
Thank you, Miss Diallo. Thank you.

125
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:40,845
Tell me again about this book
that gonna have our names in.

126
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,746
The Book of Negroes.

127
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,117
She already done told you
three times! Stop pestering her!

128
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,686
I'm just asking! I didn't
know there was a book

129
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,955
big enough to have every
Negro in New York in!

130
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,892
Knucklehead.

131
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,261
Oh, Miss Meena...

132
00:07:57,295 --> 00:08:00,485
Why don't you tell us how about how
you come to know your man, Chekura?

133
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,965
Yes, Miss Meena.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,101
When did you first encounter Chekura?

135
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,404
I met Chekura

136
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:10,006
when I was a little girl in Africa.

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,908
How?

138
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:17,947
When I was a little girl,

139
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:21,350
the man-stealers would come and take

140
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,786
many Negroes from many
villages, Fula, Bamana,

141
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,322
didn't matter who. One night,

142
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,391
they took me.

143
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:31,607
I met Chekura

144
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,642
on the long walk to the sea.

145
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:42,885
I helped the man-stealers
take the Africans.

146
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,954
This is how we came to meet.

147
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:52,293
You helped them... steal
Miss Meena from her kin?

148
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,066
He was kind to me.

149
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:03,038
He was my companion.

150
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,118
After the British surrendered,
slave owners began to prowl

151
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:21,088
Canvas Town.

152
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,890
What is it? What? What is it?

153
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,060
They took Claybourne!

154
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:28,662
He's gone!

155
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:37,971
Where's Claybourne? Where's Claybourne?

156
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,250
- I will do what I can Miss Diallo.
- Yes.

157
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,721
Claybourne!

158
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,846
- Bertilda!
- Sir, I am Lieutenant Waters

159
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,981
for His Majesty's Army.

160
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:53,884
Do you have one Claybourne
Mitchell on board?

161
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,386
What business is that of yours?

162
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,389
Claybourne Mitchell volunteered
with my regiment for two years.

163
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:01,858
Per the articles of peace,

164
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,727
any Negro who serves His
Majesty's Army for one year

165
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,629
has won his liberty.

166
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:10,867
- He's a free man.
- Well, go ahead and fetch him.

167
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,238
Sir,

168
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:18,708
the war

169
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,810
is over,

170
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:24,213
and we have a treaty
signed by your Congress.

171
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,649
That bark

172
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:28,985
is legally owned by my employer,

173
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,387
Mister, um,

174
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:33,822
Sam Stephens of Georgia.

175
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,991
He escaped the 13th,

176
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,926
but we got him now.

177
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,962
He fought for his freedom. You
have no right to hold him captive.

178
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:44,599
You speak to me again, nigger, and
I will kill you where you stand!

179
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,303
Ahem! Good day.

180
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,506
I want on the boat. I
want to leave with him.

181
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:57,178
You sellin' yourself
with a kid? It's too bad

182
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:59,748
Mr. Stephens's got all
the nigger wives he needs.

183
00:10:59,782 --> 00:11:01,850
At least let me say goodbye to him.

184
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:13,861
You still wear that sword on your hip
like you were conquering this country.

185
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:19,167
Surrender that sword.

186
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:27,875
Go on.

187
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,347
I spent four years

188
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:37,051
hunting cowardly Redcoats like yourself.

189
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,892
That nigger killed good patriots.

190
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,894
He deserves what's coming.

191
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:51,364
Bring him up.

192
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:56,903
You got one minute to
say what you gotta say.

193
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,180
You done gone and got yourself caught.

194
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:11,367
Yeah.

195
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,502
Looks that way.

196
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,574
Listen, I want you and Sarah to go

197
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:21,977
- to Nova Scotia, you hear me?
- You shut your drawbridge mouth.

198
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:25,781
Me, you, and Sarah, we is family now.

199
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:29,551
You listen to me.

200
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:32,087
I want you to go see Freddie.

201
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:35,557
He owe me one pound. You make sure you get
that money from him for you and the baby,

202
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:38,593
you hear what I'm sayin'? You understand?

203
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:42,597
You get it from him your damn self.

204
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:45,800
If I could tell you
nothing, know how hard...

205
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:55,310
Sarah? Come hug your daddy.

206
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:01,481
Mama gonna take care of you.

207
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:03,483
You understand?

208
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:05,786
- Mama gonna take care of you.
- Wait!

209
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:09,256
- You hear me? You gonna go with your mama!
- That's enough now!

210
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,959
- No!
- Get off!

211
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:14,028
All right, all right!

212
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:19,099
Y'all go on! Get!

213
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,301
I'm gonna be all right.

214
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,910
- Go on!
- Y'all go on!

215
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:26,811
Get him down!

216
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,542
We is family!

217
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:31,345
It all gonna be all right!

218
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,347
I will be all right.

219
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,648
We is family.

220
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,584
Gonna be all right.

221
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,282
What happened?

222
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,484
Meena.

223
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,757
Shh, shh...

224
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,794
Shh...

225
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,374
I'm going to help Sam cater a
conference hosted by General Washington.

226
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:40,544
- General Washington?
- South river, in Tappan.

227
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:43,781
General Washington is hosting
British General Guy Carleton

228
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,084
to discuss the British
withdrawal from New York.

229
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,555
- How long will you be gone away?
- Overnight.

230
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,525
I'll be back in the morning.

231
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:01,832
I will see you in the morning.

232
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,750
Guy Carleton and George Washington

233
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,186
met to discuss the British withdrawal.

234
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:29,125
Washington was angry that the
British were evacuating Negroes.

235
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,162
A speedy evacuation of all
His Majesty's armies, garrison

236
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:35,431
and fleets from New York
is actively under way,

237
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,433
supervised by Captain Clarkson.

238
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,836
As agreed upon, by the end of November.

239
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,771
As agreed upon, sir.

240
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:45,140
On the matter of delivery of all Negroes
and other property back to the inhabitants

241
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:47,309
of these United States, how soon

242
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,745
- will that transpire?
- Our Navy

243
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,582
has already embarked refugees
of all colors to Nova Scotia.

244
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,918
Negroes, sir.

245
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:58,387
Hmm, some Negroes were
among the refugees, yes.

246
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:01,623
Well, some of these Negroes are property
of the inhabitants of these United States

247
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:03,825
and should not have been carried off.

248
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,028
Your action violates article seven

249
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:09,531
- in the articles of peace.
- General,

250
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:12,166
with respect, Negroes who responded

251
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:16,037
to British proclamations of liberty
are no longer American property.

252
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:19,407
With these proclamations, a number of my
own slaves, slaves of members of Congress,

253
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:23,044
of officers in this very
room, abandoned their masters.

254
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,447
The carrying off of Negroes
is a clear infraction.

255
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:29,750
Infraction? Well, if declared as such

256
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,752
by our respective sovereigns,

257
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:35,123
compensation will be made
by the Crown to owners,

258
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:38,191
- including those in this room.
- Compensation?

259
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,628
In what manner?

260
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:44,164
I have taken measures to create
a register of evacuated Negroes,

261
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:47,435
classifying the name, age
and occupation of each person

262
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:50,170
as well as the name and
place of his former master.

263
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:52,239
It's impossible to ascertain
the value of the slaves

264
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:54,975
through any facts which you
may find in such a register.

265
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:58,478
A further difficulty would be
identifying the slaves' true identity,

266
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:01,148
supposing the slave gave a
false name for his master.

267
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:03,150
I must confess, General,

268
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:06,453
the mere supposition that
I, the King's Minister,

269
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:09,823
would breach the public faith
towards people of any complexion

270
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:14,093
seems to denote a less
than friendly disposition.

271
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:22,869
I'm afraid we must leave this with
our respective sovereigns. The...

272
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:27,006
dinner that Black Sam has so
generously prepared is ready.

273
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,741
General Washington

274
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:32,144
- was none too happy.
- No.

275
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,814
The British may have lost on the field
of battle, but their General Carleton

276
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,018
- has won the peace with his Book of Negroes plan.
- Hmm.

277
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:41,854
- The Negroes will have a chance at liberty.
- You.

278
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:45,190
- You as well, Meena.
- Well...

279
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:08,413
I love Chekura very much, Sam.

280
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:11,149
I know.

281
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:52,889
Forgive me for bringing you to this place.

282
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,428
There's nothing to forgive.

283
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,960
Miss Diallo, this is the ledger,

284
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,082
in which you'll record the
names of the Negro Loyalists.

286
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:38,071
Good morning, miss. Tell me your name

287
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:41,208
- and your age.
- My name is Emily.

288
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:43,710
I think I'm 23 or 24,

289
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:46,846
I don't know for sure. This my baby Janice.

290
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:50,517
- She four months.
- Where's the baby's father?

291
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:54,354
He dead. The Americans, they kill
him fighting with the British.

292
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:57,857
- Do you have a last name?
- No, just Emily. But my owner

293
00:19:57,892 --> 00:20:01,093
was Mr. John Smith, but I runs
away from him six years ago

294
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:03,930
from Charlestown. Come to New York by boat.

295
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:06,699
How did you serve the British Army?

296
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,735
I worked in Holy Ground.

297
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,370
What did you do in Holy Ground?

298
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:14,706
I performed various services
for the British Army.

299
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:18,144
Certain officers, when they
were on leave, would come to me

300
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:21,447
'cause they say I gave special
service, different from the other girls.

301
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,850
I have general birth certificate.

302
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:33,559
Just write 'lusty wench'. Go
ahead, we have no time to waste.

303
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,602
Thank you, Miss Emily. Thank
you for telling me your story.

304
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:52,009
I am meeting people from
places I have never heard of!

305
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:55,012
You have become our djeli,

306
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,148
recording our stories.

307
00:20:57,183 --> 00:21:00,351
They're giving me something.

308
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:03,054
They're letting me know that I'm not alone.

309
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,561
That we are not alone.

310
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:22,639
Our baby will be born
in March in Nova Scotia.

311
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,082
Yes.

312
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,633
John Cartwright, born 1719, Virginia.

313
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,669
I deserted the rebel standard.

314
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,238
That was service enough.

315
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:59,441
I was born a slave,

316
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,744
but I will die free.

317
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,850
Uh, Joe Mason.

318
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:09,852
I be 25 years old.

319
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:12,420
My wife and my daughter drowned

320
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:15,323
crossing the Santee River while
we run away from Samuel Ash.

321
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:21,296
Got a plantation down there
in Edisto, South Carolina.

322
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,831
I worked as a blacksmith
for the King's Army.

323
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:26,301
From April to November,

324
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:28,537
I helped register thousands of Blacks

325
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:30,705
who were leaving New
York. Some went as slaves

326
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:34,441
of British officers,
but others traveled free.

327
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:38,112
- George Haskins.
- They had been promised land

328
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:41,282
and tools to break the land
and provisions on which to live

329
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:44,251
until they could enjoy
the fruit of their farming

330
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:47,421
in Nova Scotia. I wrote
names in the Book of Negroes,

331
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:50,791
recording how people had got their freedom,

332
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:54,094
how old they were, and
where they had been born.

333
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:57,698
South Carolina, Virginia, Madagascar,

334
00:22:57,732 --> 00:23:00,067
Angola, and Bonny.

335
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:03,203
People watched the movement of
my hand as I wrote their names

336
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:06,873
and made me read them
aloud once I was done.

337
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:09,609
The work left me weary,

338
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:12,713
but it excited me to imagine
that, fifty years later,

339
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:15,148
someone might find an ancestor

340
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,317
in the Book of Negroes and say,

341
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:20,653
"That was my grandmother".

342
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:23,055
Prince.

343
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,825
So the nuns called me. I
didn't have a mother or father.

344
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,428
I picked up arms and
fought with the British

345
00:23:28,462 --> 00:23:31,163
when the Americans started the fight.

346
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:33,533
I have a wooden leg now.

347
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,102
Lost it in Brooklyn Heights
fighting them rebels, and killed me

348
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:39,091
many an American. Now I's free.

349
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:42,074
I want me my own land
in this here Nova Scotia.

350
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:45,511
Sarah is my name.

351
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:47,647
I be 42 years old.

352
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,983
Got blind mixing lye for
soap. An explosion went off.

353
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:54,419
Man one foot over was
handing me his red coat,

354
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:57,122
telling me to wash it soft and gentle.

355
00:23:57,157 --> 00:24:00,559
Killed him lickety-split,
so I reckon I was lucky.

356
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:03,462
I know worse trouble, though.

357
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:10,135
- May I have your name, miss?
- My name Aminata.

358
00:24:13,238 --> 00:24:15,874
My mama Sanu said I
was born on a slave ship

359
00:24:15,908 --> 00:24:17,909
going to South Carolina.

360
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,913
Where is your mother now?

361
00:24:21,947 --> 00:24:25,583
Died two years ago. Got shot
up while nursing the British.

362
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:28,419
Dear God, girl!

363
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:31,088
I am Aminata too!

364
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:35,693
I caught you! I caught you

365
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:37,861
coming out of your
mother on that slave ship!

366
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,164
She named you after me!

367
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:43,500
She named you after me!

368
00:24:43,534 --> 00:24:46,203
My mama told me all about you!

369
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:49,940
She spoke of you a thousand times!

370
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:51,875
Look at you.

371
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,678
You are Sanu's daughter.

372
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,454
I can't keep my family waiting any longer.

373
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:06,456
I leave for London in the morning.

374
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,126
Well done, Miss Diallo. And my ship?

375
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,161
When can I leave with my husband?

376
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:15,098
Your tickets for the Joseph,

377
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:18,034
departing November the
7th for Annapolis Royal.

378
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:21,337
Oh, do please write to me in London.

379
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:23,339
Here. I'm so curious to hear

380
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,574
how the Negro Loyalists
fare in Nova Scotia.

381
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,911
- Thank you, Captain.
- Good luck.

382
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:32,147
Drop Claybourne's name
and the name of his master

383
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:34,783
in the fishnet when you get to Georgia.
Someone will know where they took him.

384
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:37,886
You have a good man here, Miss Meena.

385
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,888
You hold on to him.

386
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,658
Ain't no patriot gonna
bust up me and Claybourne.

387
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:46,194
He better know to stay alive
till me and Sarah find him.

388
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:48,830
I have secured tickets
from Captain Clarkson.

389
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:51,066
For Nova Scotia.

390
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:56,805
Two tickets: one for you and
Sarah, and one is for Claybourne.

391
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,107
The last ship leaves from New York

392
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,476
to Nova Scotia on November 30th.

393
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,312
Thank you for going through
the trouble, Miss Meena.

394
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:11,719
I don't got much.

395
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:14,221
We're still young, though.

396
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:16,491
I'm gonna do what I have
to to win my man's freedom.

397
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:20,261
This should help you buy his freedom.

398
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,331
I'll pay you back every
penny, Mr. Fraunces, you hear?

399
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:28,035
I know.

400
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:32,173
I ain't gonna let this child
grow up without knowing her daddy.

401
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,675
We can spread the word for
Claybourne in Nova Scotia,

402
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:37,011
- Bertilda. He's smart and...
- I was born in these colonies

403
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,312
and this is where I'm gonna die.

404
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:43,383
I be American, Miss Meena.

405
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:48,488
I be American.

406
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:08,341
When George Washington and his men
rode into New York to meet his aides

407
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,443
and celebrate the rebel victory,

408
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:13,045
it killed the hope in
those of us left behind.

409
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,415
If we didn't get out soon, we would be

410
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,118
re-enslaved and might never get out again.

411
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:22,521
Nine days ago,

412
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:25,224
the last of the British
Army left American soil,

413
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:28,626
and we have truly won our revolution.

414
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:32,297
- Hear, hear!
- I must, however, bid you all farewell.

415
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:34,432
I intend on commencing a journey

416
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,035
this day to Annapolis, where
I will resign my commission.

417
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,137
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

418
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:42,507
It is with a heart filled
with love and gratitude

419
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,909
that I now take my leave of you.

420
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:47,879
I most devoutly wish that
your latter days may be

421
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:50,248
as prosperous and happy as your former ones

422
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:53,251
have been glorious and honorable.

423
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:57,188
Hear, hear.

424
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:03,127
General Washington.

425
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:07,564
Please forgive the intrusion.

426
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,067
Of course.

427
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:14,305
Do you think the Negro will one day
have his freedom like the Americans?

428
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,340
Hm.

429
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:23,781
I can foresee that nothing
but the rooting out of slavery

430
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:26,249
will perpetuate the existence of our Union.

431
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:28,419
Then, General,

432
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,587
why do you own slaves?

433
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:35,425
Here is your hat and coat, General.

434
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:38,728
I'm afraid the General must be on his way.

435
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,462
- Thank you for your help, Sam.
- Hm.

436
00:29:19,436 --> 00:29:22,070
Safe travels, Miss Diallo.

437
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,806
You're a good friend, Sam.

438
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,327
Your names?

439
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:48,997
I am Aminata Diallo and this is my husband,

440
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,732
Chekura Tiano.

441
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:00,173
Aminata Diallo.

442
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:02,510
Return here, please.

443
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:06,780
- Why?
- Aminata Diallo,

444
00:30:06,815 --> 00:30:10,718
there's a claim against you, we cannot
allow you to leave. Go with these men.

445
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:13,120
- What claim?
- There will be no discussion.

446
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:17,224
I have a certificate from General
Birch. I have worked for the English

447
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:21,228
for years, from April up
until a week ago! I was working

448
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:25,198
on this very document, the Book
of Negroes, under Captain Clarkson!

449
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,934
You'll be allowed to respond to
the allegations of your claimant.

450
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:29,600
- What claimant?
- Gentlemen, remove this woman.

451
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:30,601
It's Lindo.

452
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:32,939
- It's Lindo. Lindo has made a claim on me!
- Please!

453
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:35,274
- I am her husband and I go with her.
- Now look here, boy.

454
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,577
If you get off this ship,
you will board no other.

455
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:40,246
If she prevails over her
claimant, she may board

456
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,116
another vessel. But if you leave this ship,
you stay in New York. I will see to that.

457
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,987
No. No.

458
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:50,656
- No, I will not leave.
- Go, go.

459
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,960
- I will not leave you.
- It's the only way.

460
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:53,961
Take her!

461
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,697
Canvas Town, at once had
been a fountain of life.

462
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:31,824
Now, after the British evacuation,
it was like a ghost town,

463
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:35,328
with just a few handfuls
of dispirited folks.

464
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,905
State your name.

465
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,509
- Aminata Diallo.
- Are you a runaway slave?

466
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:53,846
I was once a man's property, but
now I am free, like the Americans.

467
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,981
No, you're a runaway
slave from South Carolina.

468
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:58,183
A claim has been made against you.

469
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,218
Bring in the claimant.

470
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:14,899
- Meena, it's been too long.
- How dare you.

471
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,435
Your Honor, I own this woman.

472
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,071
She was loaned out to a Mr. Solomon Lindo,

473
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,174
of Charleston, and this
same Mr. Solomon Lindo

474
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:27,278
absconded with my property and
then she ran away in New York City.

475
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,014
This, sir, indicates

476
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,818
that I purchased this woman
from a Mr. William King in 1761.

477
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,260
What is your response to this?

478
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,262
That part is true,

479
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,998
but I was sold to Solomon Lindo in 1773.

480
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:52,503
Mr. Lindo manumitted me in 1775.

481
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,572
So where are your manumission papers?

482
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,980
- I've lost them.
- She lost them, Your Honor.

483
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,583
I did not lose my documents.

484
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,052
Right there is proof of ownership.

485
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,654
Miss Diallo, have you anything
else to say for yourself?

486
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,524
- He's lying.
- Sir,

487
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:16,759
if I may have a moment of the Court's time?

488
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:19,061
Mr. Fraunces,

489
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,264
have you something to
contribute to this process?

490
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,899
You know me to be an
upstanding businessman.

491
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:26,401
- Your reputation is steady.
- Now, I must ask

492
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:28,403
for a brief delay of two hours.

493
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:30,973
I am obtaining proof
on behalf of this woman.

494
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:33,642
Two hours.

495
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:36,511
Yes, sir.

496
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:40,149
You're coming home with
me, Meena. Coming home.

497
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,727
Thank you.

498
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,995
Did you think that I wouldn't find you?

499
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:56,030
What do you want?

500
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:59,300
To own you. And that child you're carrying.

501
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,402
You're my property.

502
00:34:01,436 --> 00:34:03,638
I am no man's property.

503
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:06,107
I am a free woman.

504
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:08,109
Negroes do not understand

505
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,245
the meaning of that word.

506
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:13,181
If they did, they would not
help bring their own people here.

507
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:15,783
Now, true Americans know what liberty is.

508
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,785
I fought the British and I've got a...

509
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,388
I've got a crippled leg
now to show for that.

510
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:22,823
Hmm?

511
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:27,161
- Remember the big house?
- Oh...

512
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:30,164
You could've been up there close to me.

513
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:34,968
But you went and you let
an African impregnate you.

514
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:37,304
He has great honor.

515
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:39,306
You have none.

516
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,875
I sold your child, Meena.

517
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,311
Only got a few pounds for her.

518
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:48,348
No man could sell my child.

519
00:34:48,382 --> 00:34:53,186
I would hunt him down to the ends
of the earth until I killed him.

520
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,188
What did your boy do?

521
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:58,525
What kind of man is that?

522
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,027
That's a slave, Meena.

523
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:03,830
Sir.

524
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:06,966
The justice of the peace has called
the court back in session, sir.

525
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:10,937
Meena.

526
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,972
I love that slave.

527
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:23,716
Freely.

528
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:33,892
Miss Diallo, Mr. Fraunces has not returned
with any evidence of your claim of freedom.

529
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,094
Mr. Fraunces...

530
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,696
said he would return, and he shall.

531
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,798
Miss Diallo, do you have

532
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,268
any evidence to substantiate

533
00:35:43,302 --> 00:35:45,636
- your claim of freedom?
- I ask Your Honor for more time.

534
00:35:45,671 --> 00:35:48,439
With all due respect, Your Honor, I
ask you to uphold the rule of the law

535
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:51,076
and return my property to me.

536
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,145
Miss Diallo, as you can see,
I've got three more cases.

537
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,146
I'm afraid I can no longer wait, I...

538
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:58,583
Ah, Mr. Fraunces.

539
00:36:00,586 --> 00:36:03,921
- Have you made any progress, sir?
- Yes, sir, I have.

540
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,024
I present to you Mr. Solomon Lindo.

541
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:12,754
Mr. Lindo.

542
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,600
What stake have you in this case?

543
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:17,977
This man, Mr. Appleby,

544
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,722
sold Meena D. to me in 1773.

545
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:25,326
He does not own her. I
do. Shall I show you proof?

546
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,762
It's been a long day, Mr. Lindo.

547
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:30,264
Just read it out.

548
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:39,073
"Bill of sale between Robinson
Appleby, of St. Helena Island,

549
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:41,641
and Solomon Lindo, of Charleston.

550
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:45,446
Terms of sale of Meena, a Guinea wench".

551
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,682
- Will that suffice, sir?
- Read on.

552
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:56,957
"Solomon Lindo agrees to
purchase said wench, Meena,

553
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:59,158
for sixty pounds sterling,

554
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:01,461
and arrange the sale of May,

555
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:03,763
daughter of Meena.

556
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:06,967
Said sale to be effected
in Savannah, Georgia,

557
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:10,871
with terms suitable to
Robinson Appleby and Mr. Lindo."

558
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:14,840
I did this,

559
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,909
but I sought to place the child

560
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,013
in a caring family.

561
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:22,915
Mr. Appleby, would you care to reply?

562
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,917
No.

563
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,887
I have nothing to say to him.

564
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:30,589
Hand me the contract.

565
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,694
This court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning.

566
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:39,464
I will evaluate the contract
and render my decision

567
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:42,001
about this matter then.

568
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:45,404
Until then, you will be kept in chains.

569
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:53,278
Meena, may I have a word?

570
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,282
Aminata.

571
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,819
I have nothing to say to you.

572
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:05,523
Appleby was determined to sell your
baby to an owner and you to another.

573
00:38:05,558 --> 00:38:07,559
What happened to my baby?

574
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:11,696
- From what I know, she died young.
- If you knew

575
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,299
it meant selling away my baby,
why did you do that to us?

576
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:19,636
You are no Hebrew.

577
00:38:22,307 --> 00:38:24,475
I will no longer think of you.

578
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,212
Meena.

579
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,797
I have looked over the contract
between Mr. Appleby and Mr. Lindo.

580
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,472
Mr. Appleby, you have no honor.

581
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:40,899
You have one day to get out of New York.

582
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:54,020
Goodbye, Meena.

583
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:05,165
Mr. Lindo, you may take your property.

584
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:09,168
She's not my property.

585
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,305
I wish Meena to be free.

586
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:15,474
You're manumitting your slave?

587
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:19,679
It's a matter of making peace with my past.

588
00:39:22,215 --> 00:39:24,183
I'm marking her down here

589
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:26,918
as free. Set this woman loose.

590
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:45,970
Aminata.

591
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:48,673
Aminata, I'm sorry.

592
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:53,144
Next claimant.

593
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:56,380
For your journey. Crab cakes.

594
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:58,182
- Ohh, crab cakes!
- Cheese,

595
00:39:58,217 --> 00:40:01,018
two loaves of bread...

596
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:04,255
Fresh apples, and some beer.

597
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:07,091
Sam... Sam...

598
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:13,530
I don't know how to repay you.

599
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:15,899
Oh...

600
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:22,606
Freedom will come to
every Negro in America.

601
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,908
It will take some time,

602
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:27,644
but one day, the
Declaration of Independence

603
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,213
will live up to its creed.

604
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:32,815
Our new country will be called

605
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,218
the United States of America.

606
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:37,887
What's so united about it?

607
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:42,559
There's nothing united

608
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:46,896
about a nation that declares
all men are created equal,

609
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:49,665
but keeps its people in chains.

610
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:54,603
- I'm going to stay here and work on that.
- Will you?

611
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:56,639
And will I live to see it?

612
00:40:56,673 --> 00:40:58,641
Are you sure you don't want to stay

613
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:01,177
in these United States?

614
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,946
- I could use your help.
- No, Sam, no.

615
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:08,317
It is time for me to
leave this new country.

616
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:13,021
My husband awaits me in Nova Scotia.

617
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,060
General Washington has offered
me a job in his residence

618
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:21,062
as head cook.

619
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:24,666
Mount Vernon, Virginia. I took it.

620
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,368
I'm going to close the tavern.

621
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,637
You are a true American.

622
00:41:29,672 --> 00:41:32,507
And the Americans will prove
to be the better people.

623
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:35,476
Hmm...

624
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:39,614
I will take my chances with the British.

625
00:41:41,617 --> 00:41:44,285
Will I ever see you again, Aminata Diallo?

626
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:20,253
Goodbye, Sam.

627
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:54,186
I had lost my belongings,

628
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,055
but I was going to see my husband.

629
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,191
I had my legs,

630
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:01,393
which were still in working order,

631
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:04,461
and a child growing in my belly.

632
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:08,900
I wonder what will dawn
bright in Nova Scotia.
