[man] All right, let's go.
Move it!

00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,700
Come on, move, man. Move.
Let's go.

Pick up your positions.

[man] Nicky, I got a letter
from your mother.

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,300
All right, boys, let's do it.
We don't got all day.

41
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Welcome home.

42
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,300
Ain't Buckingham Palace,
but looks like something.

43
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Roof, bed to sleep on.
Garraty, how the fuck are ya?

44
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
Garraty. Don't feed him.
He fuckin' bites.

45
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,200
Find a bed.
Unpack your kit.

46
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Yeah. Hey, hey,
welcome, welcome.

Bunch of fucking clowns.

48
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Gentlemen, we chow
at 1700 hours.

49
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
That's it. That's my bit.

The illustrious Lieutenant
Hollowborn. Sir.

51
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,100
Men, I'm Lieutenant Hollowborn .

52
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't give a fuck
what you did before.

53
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
There's no dope smoking
in this platoon.

54
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,800
You settle in,
get some chow, get some rest.

55
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,600
We open our first tunnel
tomorrow.

56
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,700
You have any problems,
talk to Sergeant Heaney.

57
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,500
Or me, or whatever.

58
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,700
First tunnel tomorrow?
Great.

59
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,300
Three months off the boat
and I'm already in this
hellhole.

60
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
That's my stuff.

61
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,600
- What's your name, white bread?
- Miller.

62
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
It's early to get
your ass whipped.

63
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Fuck this shit.

64
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,200
[man] Uh, you're on my bunk.

65
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,000
- Yeah. You wanna trade?
- No.

66
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Goddamn it.

[rock plays on radio]

68
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
You look in the Bible
at the Battle of Jericho.

69
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,200
Joshua is ordered by Yahweh
to slay every man, woman,
child, cattle

70
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,400
and slave of his enemy. That's
how you win a fucking war.

71
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,600
You want the prisoner hung?

72
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,900
That fucking gook murdered five
of my men. I want him hung.

73
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
I understand, lieutenant,
but he's still a soldier.

74
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
He's not a soldier.
He's not in uniform.

75
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,600
I want him hung.

76
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,300
Yes, sir.

77
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,700
Corporal.

78
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,300
[Hollowborn] Platoon, form up.

79
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Witness the execution.

80
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,900
[man] You heard him.

81
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,300
[Hollowborn] Let's go. Let's go.

82
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,500
[man shouting]

83
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
[Heaney] This man
is a VC sniper.

84
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,800
He's killed at least five
of our brothers.

85
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,200
We show no mercy.

86
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We take no prisoners.

87
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
- [cracking]
- [laughter]

88
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,800
[man] Best gook's a dead gook.

89
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,400
[man 2] They're sick.

90
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,800
- They're sick.
- Garraty, cut him down.

91
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,500
[Garraty] All right.

92
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
Where I come from,
that's murder.

93
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,400
You got a problem with the Army,
or with me, asshole?

94
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,600
I believe I've got
a problem with you, sir.

95
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,900
Good.

96
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,600
[man] You one of the new guys?

97
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,400
How long you been here?

98
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
A while.

99
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,900
- Heard about the tunnels?
- Yeah.

100
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,200
- Ever been in one?
- A few.

101
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Well, shit.
Welcome to the camp.

102
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,800
- Porterson.
- Johnson.

103
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,000
[Porterson] All right.

104
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,400
Thanks.

105
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
Johnson, right?

106
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Miller. Bob Miller.

107
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,600
And you are...?

108
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,500
- Porterson.
- Porterson.

109
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Right.

110
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,500
Man, I just cannot
get used to this food.

111
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
My mom's the best cook.

112
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,100
Her brisket
is out of this world.

113
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Every Friday night,
we have the best Shabbat dinner.

114
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Me, her, the entire
neighborhood.

115
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,700
I can't wait to get back.

116
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,000
She's sick, my mom.

117
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,400
Every week I'm away, it breaks
her heart more and more.

118
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,300
If I lose her
before I get back...

119
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,800
- Gary, right?
- Yeah.

120
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Miller.

121
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,200
People like Miller
got no business being here.

122
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,000
- I know.
- Blabbermouths.

123
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,300
Nothing they say
is ever worth hearing.

124
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,900
Talking too much out here
can get you hurt, get other
people killed.

125
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Take a look at them,
for example.

126
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Battle-hardened vets, they come
in, eat their chow and leave.

127
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,600
Then you got enlisted types who
think this is a fucking game.

128
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Then there's guys like Miller.

129
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Future KIA.

130
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,900
Someone who talks a lot because
he's scared shitless to be here.

131
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
Well, I hope this
makes you feel better.

132
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,100
[grunting]

133
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You wanna play God,
you son of a bitch?

134
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Is that what you
wanna do, play God?

135
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Ah!

136
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,200
It ain't about God or the devil,
Harris. It's about survival.

137
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
All right.

138
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,200
[grunting]

139
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,200
Charlie's gonna kill you
just for fucking being here.

140
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
He doesn't care
if you're a nice guy.

141
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,000
[groaning]

142
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,700
[indistinct chatter]

143
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
Same old shit.

144
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Verano, come here.

145
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,200
- Sarge?
- What's wrong with the food?

146
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Just tastes bad, sergeant.

147
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,400
I know. Where you from?

148
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,800
- Michigan.
- Yeah?

149
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,700
My wife's folks have a place in
Charlevoix. Know where that is?

150
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,600
- Yeah. Really?
- It's around the lake.

151
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
It's beautiful.

152
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,200
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

153
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,800
You ever get scared out there?

154
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Let me tell you the
only thing you need to know.

155
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
This place is
all about survival.

156
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
It's not black and white.
It's all grey.

157
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
The sooner you realize that,

158
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
the better chance you've got
of packing your shit

159
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,200
together one day
and doing that

160
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,700
duffle bag drag
back to the world.

161
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,100
- Understand?
- Yeah.

162
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,200
All right.
Now finish your meal.

163
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,500
[man] Over here. Over here.

164
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,700
[indistinct chatter]

165
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,300
[soft rock plays]

166
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,400
- All right, going for three?
- Going for three.

167
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
You beat me twice. I think
you're trying to hustle me, boy.

168
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
- Show me the queen.
- Here we go.

169
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
- The queen, you got it?
- Got it.

170
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Look at this beautiful
black queen.

171
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,300
- Lookin' at her?
- Yeah.

172
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,500
Keep your eye on her, boy. Come
on. You ready? Where's she at?

173
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
You got her, right?
Keep your eyes open, boy.

174
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,400
All you've gotta think about
is that beautiful, black,

175
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,600
- thick queen. Where's she at?
- She's right there.

176
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,000
- You sure?
- Positive.

177
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,900
- Damn, boy. Look at that.
- [both laugh]

178
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,500
You're getting hustled,
Verano.

179
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,600
Stop corrupting Terence.

180
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,700
Nobody's corrupting.
Am I corrupting you?

181
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,600
- No.
- Trying to learn something.

182
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,900
- OK.
- Damn this thing.

183
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,900
Big, heavy ass.
Come on, split six.

184
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
- Six?
- Yep. Come on.

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

186
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Let's go.

187
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,500
Where you at, boy?

188
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,700
- Where's she at?
- She's right there.

189
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,200
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

190
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,200
Uh-oh. Shame, boy.
Come on, pay up.

191
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,100
- Big fucking surprise.
- All good. You'll win next
time.

192
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,600
Better save your cigarettes,
Terence.

193
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,300
[Lidford] Ain't got nothing
to do with you.

194
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
What you reading
over there, man?

195
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Romans, Chapter 11.

196
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
Romans, Chapter 11.
You hear that?

197
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,300
Got a southern belle out here.
Flip that on to Jeremiah 29:11.

198
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,100
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,600
- Where'd you find this?
- Chicago.

200
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
- What you know about the Bible?
- I'm about to learn you.

201
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah, OK.

202
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
"'For I know the thoughts
that I think toward you,'
said the Lord,

203
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
'Thoughts of peace
and not of evil,

204
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,400
to give you
an expected end.

205
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,600
Then shall you
call upon me...'"

206
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
"'Then shall you call
upon me and I will listen,

207
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
and I will call you
from the nations

208
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
from which you were banished,
and I will bring you out of
the exile

209
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,200
- in which I carried you.'"
- That's right.

210
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,300
[laughs] What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

211
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,900
Tell him what it mean, Harris.

212
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,000
If you have faith, God will save
you from this horrible shit.

213
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,500
- Mm-hm.
- You got faith?

214
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,900
- Yeah, I do.
- God's gonna save you
from this shit?

215
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,800
- I believe that.
- Well, that's good.

216
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Because while men are cutting
off other men's heads
for trophies

217
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
and hanging ears
around their neck,

218
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,600
it's good to know that Harris
is going to be saved.

219
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,900
- This isn't the end, man.
- This is the end.

220
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Ain't nobody trying to
hear that jive-ass shit.

221
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,600
- You're fucking up my high.
- That book is a high.

222
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
- Here we go.
- That book's a high.

223
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,900
Got men believing they're
gonna get swept out of here.

224
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,600
Shut the fuck up.
How about that?

225
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,000
Got to you, huh?

226
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,900
- I'll kick your ass, man.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

227
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,300
- Yeah.
- Do something, nigga.

228
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,300
- You fucking hoodies.
- Go take a shower, bitch.

229
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
Yeah.

230
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,700
Come on, boy. Come on.
Put your money up, boy.

231
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,000
Show me the queen.

232
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

233
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,300
[man] Fucking small-minded,
ghetto hoodies. Fantasy land.

234
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,600
- What's your name? Gil...
- Graybridge.

235
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Graybridge.
Where you from, Graybridge?

236
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,200
Let me ask you a question.
Do you believe in God?

237
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,600
I believe in God.
Let me ask you a question.

238
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,000
When was the last time
Red Sox won the Series?

239
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
I don't know.
Fifty-some years ago, I guess.

240
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,300
That answer your question?
I tell you what.

241
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,700
A greater franchise has never
existed. This is our year.

242
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,200
- Year. Year of the franchise.
- What the fuck are you smoking?

243
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,700
- No, listen. You like burgers?
- Everybody likes burgers.

244
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,500
Right, everybody likes burgers,
but check it out.

245
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,900
In California,
this guy started up a franchise.

246
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,300
That's the magic word.

247
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Burgers, fries, shakes,
speed, like that.

248
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,500
You just find a plot of land,
he fronts the dough. It's easy
as pie.

249
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,800
It's the American dream.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Which American dream?
This fucking American dream?

251
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I don't know, man. This don't
seem like no dream to me.

252
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
No, you're missing it. I'm
talking about when I get back.

253
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm gonna be my own boss.
I'm gonna be an entrepreneur.

254
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,900
- I'm gonna...
- You're gonna...
Me too, Graybridge.

255
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,200
Me too. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get a girl.

256
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm gonna get a boat.
I'm gonna get a little house
on Lake Winnipesaukee.

257
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,000
It's gonna be fucking great.
I'm serious.

258
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,400
But meantime,

259
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,300
this is what we've got right
here. Right fucking here.

260
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
There's a forest full
of chinky-eyed motherfuckers,

261
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,500
and they got their vision of the
gook dream, whatever that is.

262
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,900
They'll slit your
fucking throat to get it.

263
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,700
- You're missing it...
- Oh yeah? Tell me.

264
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,100
Burger joints.
They're the wave of the future.

265
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,400
That sounds good.
How about some fucking water?

266
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,100
Yeah. Sure.

267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Fucking war.

268
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
What the fuck, man?!
Did you piss in this?

269
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,700
- Nah, nah.
- Fuck! Thank you.

270
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,900
You're a real winner.

271
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,700
[Lidford] This is serious shit,
boy, all right? Pay attention.

272
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,100
There's power to the way a man
smokes a cigarette, all right?

273
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
- Right-handed?
- Yeah.

274
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,100
All right.
Relax your shoulders.

275
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Look forward. Inhale.

276
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,700
- [coughing] Shit!
- You all right?

277
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,600
Heading to the tunnels tomorrow.
I wouldn't be smoking.

278
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,500
The VC don't give a damn
about no cigarette smoke.

279
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,800
When you're underground in a
confined space, the VC can smell
anything on you:

280
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,000
Your aftershave,
cigarette smoke in your uniform.

281
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,500
They can even tell what brand.
If that happens, you're as good
as dead.

282
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Bullshit, Johnson.
Bullshit, all right?

283
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,500
My mom would kill me
if she saw me doing this.

284
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,100
I wouldn't worry about your mom
killing you tomorrow, Verano.

285
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,500
My parents have a house
on Lake Michigan.

286
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
And at night, me and my sister,
we'd sneak out and go down
to the beach.

287
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We'd run up the sand dune and
lay there and look at the stars.

288
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
We'd talk about
all kinds of shit.

289
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,900
She'd talk about girl stuff
and I'd talk about baseball.

290
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,100
We'd spend hours up there.

291
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,800
I remember one time... [laughs]

292
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,600
...we fell asleep up there
and we got in so much trouble.

293
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,800
I woke up to my fucking dog
licking me in my face.

294
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't know, man.

295
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,400
I'd do anything
to see my family right now.

296
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
My sister and my dog
and my parents.

297
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
What about your folks?

298
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,300
It must have been pretty tough
on you, your mom and your dad.

299
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
You don't know shit about
my mom and my dad.

300
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,700
Sorry.

301
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Why you asking all these
stupid-ass questions, anyway?

302
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,800
- Get the fuck off my bunk, man.
- I didn't mean anything. Sorry.

303
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
[Porterson]
None of that shit matters.

304
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,100
Where you've been,
where you're from.

305
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,300
Right now you're in Vietnam.

306
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,500
It matters what you do
on that field.

307
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Oh, shit.

308
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
Got a blow a kiss to my girl.

309
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, yeah. The moon
is nice and bright out there.

310
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,100
- Who you out there kissing?
- Oh, it's a concept

311
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
me and my girl came up with:
the satellite of love.

312
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,200
I send a kiss up every night
and she takes one down from
the moon.

313
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,500
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

314
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,800
Let me ask you something.

315
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,700
What happened with you
and Hollowborn today?

316
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,200
We had to talk
a couple things out.

317
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,900
- Did you get to say anything?
- Not much.

318
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,200
Yeah, maybe next time you'll
keep your mouth shut, huh?

319
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Hero. John Wayne.

320
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,800
Thanks for the headset, Verano.

321
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh, man!

322
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Would you eat here?

323
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,800
[laughs] Yeah, it looks good.

324
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,100
Hey. Thanks.

325
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,200
[indistinct chatter]

326
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
[Harris] I heard about
these tunnels.

327
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,500
I had an uncle who died
here last year.

328
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Your uncle obviously
didn't have an M-60.

329
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
They say they stretch
for hundreds of miles.

330
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,100
No one knows where
they start or where they end.

331
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,700
This is a really bad
place to be.

332
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,800
- This is it. You ready?
- I was born ready.

333
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,600
- You nervous?
- Not at all.
Just follow my lead.

334
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,700
- You got it.
- [imitating] You got it.

335
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,400
You just love following the
white man, don't you, boy?

336
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Saddle up, motherfuckers.
We're moving out.

337
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
- Corporal Green, take point.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,000
Garraty, get that 60, in front
of me. Johnson, bring up the
rear. Let's go. Fall in.

339
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,700
[Hollowborn] RTO, you do not
leave my side.

340
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Let's go. Let's go.

341
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,600
[man] Right away.

342
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,100
[whistles]

343
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
Check it out, man.

344
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,300
- Heaney.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Secure the perimeter.

346
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,400
Verano, Lidford, Green,
give me a perimeter.

347
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,500
We found this tunnel before
sundown, and I'm not clearing
a tunnel at night.

348
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
OK, this is what it's all
about.

349
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm using a stick,

350
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,500
whereas a knife
might set off a trap.

351
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,200
And these holes are full of
them.

352
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
Volunteers.

353
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,700
- Got it, sir.
- I'll go first.

354
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,500
Garraty, Johnson, Porterson.

355
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,300
I ain't got a lot of cock,
but I've got a lot of balls.

356
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Harris, take the 60.

357
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,500
- Fucking John Wayne.
- Fucking A.

358
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,900
Hey, Garraty,
five bucks for a dead gook.

359
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,100
All right.

360
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Later, fuckers.

361
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,900
- [gunshot]
- Shit.

362
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
- What the fuck, man?
- I'll get him.

363
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Watch your fucking six.

364
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,800
[gasping]

365
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
[gunshot]

366
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,700
[man] Shot in the stomach!
Coming up!

367
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,300
Porterson, give me a hand.

368
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,800
[gasping]

369
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,200
I need another compress!

370
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,600
[gasping]

371
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,900
[Porterson] I'm right here.
I gotcha. I gotcha.

372
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
You hold on, man.

373
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,200
Garraty, look at me.
Look at me. I'm right here.

374
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,600
You're going to make it.
Just hang in there.

375
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You're going to make it.
Hold on.

376
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Garraty? Look at me. Look at me.

377
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,400
- Shit!
- Clear him. Porterson,
give me grenades.

378
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
- Give me grenades.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,500
[Hollowborn] Blow it. Blow it
and get the fuck out of there!

380
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,200
[man] Come on!

381
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
[Hollowborn] Come on!

382
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,200
- Come on!
- Get him out!

383
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,200
[man] Get the fuck out!

384
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,200
[man] Eyes on that treeline.

385
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
How many VC did
you see down there?

386
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,500
I saw two VC, lieutenant.

387
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,300
All right, get some
CS gas down there.

388
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,500
Harris?

389
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm gonna take Garraty
back to base camp. Heaney.

390
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,900
I want them to gather
as much intel as is left.

391
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Dave, Bob,
you're going with me.

392
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,200
Yes, Sir.

393
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,500
Miller, leave the radio with me.

394
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,100
[man] Still on that treeline.

395
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,300
[Hollowborn] Come on,
let's get him up.

396
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,000
- [man] Porterson, you ready?
- Ready.

397
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
[Porterson] We've got one!
Got one VC coming up!

398
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,100
- Got him?
- Coming up.

399
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,400
Over here.

400
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
- His fucking leg.
- Grab it.

401
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,100
- [Porterson] Got another one.
- [man] Got another one.

402
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,100
Lidford, give me a knife
and a flashlight.

403
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
We're going back down.

404
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,000
- [man] Hook it up.
- [man #2] I got it.

405
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,900
- [man] All set.
- [man #2] Back down.

406
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,200
[man] Let's get this hooked up.

407
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,700
- The radio's on.
- Here you go.

408
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,200
Keep your eyes peeled.

409
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,500
[metal scraping]

410
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,200
[panting]

411
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,100
It's a dead end.
There's nothing down here.

412
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,100
[speaking Vietnamese]

413
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
[panting]

414
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,800
[Johnson] I'm gonna go up
and check the surrounding area,

415
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
see if I can find
Sergeant Heaney,

416
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,600
let him know this section's
clear. Cover the rear.

417
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,600
Right behind you.

418
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,700
[gagging]

419
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,200
[Porterson] Johnson!

420
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Johnson! Johnson!

421
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,900
[gagging]

422
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
[panting]

423
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,100
Alpha Bravo, come in. Over.
Check the tension.

424
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,900
- It's loose.
- Shit!

425
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Harris, Lidford,
stay here in case they come
back.

426
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Green, Verano, come with me.
We're gonna check that out.

427
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Yes, sir.

428
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
[vomiting]

429
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,800
- Jesus Christ.
- Fucking Christ.

430
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
We need to get to
Harris and Lidford.

431
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,500
- What about Porterson?
- We're gonna leave him here?

432
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,900
We'll come back.
We need to get back.

433
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
What about Porterson?

434
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,300
[grunting]

435
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,800
[coughing]

436
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
[grunts]

437
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,900
What the fuck, man? Where the
fuck is everybody else?

438
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
- Johnson's dead.
- What the fuck you mean
he's dead?

439
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
What you think
he means he's dead?

440
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,200
He's got a fucking hole in the
neck the size of a baseball

441
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,100
- and blood coming out his eyes!
- Hey!

442
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,800
- Calm the fuck down.
- We get the picture.

443
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,100
- What about Porterson?
- We didn't see him.

444
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,700
- What now?
- Harris, get on the radio.

445
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Try to get a hold of the
lieutenant. Lidford,
I need you to cover him.

446
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,500
Verano, you also. Corporal,
stay. I'm going in.

447
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
- I'm going with you.
- Sure about that?

448
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,800
Fuck that.
Fuck "Corporal, stay here."

449
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,100
Charlie Six to Alpha One, over.

450
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,500
We're sitting fucking ducks
for Charlie right now.

451
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,900
I think you understand that,
sergeant.

452
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Yes, I do.

453
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Charlie Six to Alpha One, over.

454
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
- Fuck this!
- Come on!

455
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,200
[Harris] Charlie Six to Alpha
One, over.

456
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,700
[Green] We're supposed to stick
around like a bunch of ducks

457
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,100
waiting for Charlie
to come to us? Fuck that.

458
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
[Heaney] Hold tight.
Hold tight.

459
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,400
[Green] Good luck,
fuckers.

460
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,800
- [Lidford] Get that working.
- I'm trying.

461
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,500
Get that shit working!
Make the fucking shit work!

462
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Make the shit work!
Make it work!

463
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,800
That's not gonna help, OK?

464
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,600
It's dead, man. It's dead.

465
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
Shh.

466
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,000
What's wrong?

467
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,900
The tunnel splits
in two different directions.

468
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,200
We need to split up.

469
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Porterson is down here
someplace,

470
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,500
If we don't find him, someone
else will. We need to split up.

471
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,800
We stay together,
and stay quiet.

472
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,900
[speaking Vietnamese]

473
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,800
[panting]

474
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
[crashing]

475
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,700
Ah!

476
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,900
- Sarge? Oh, my God!
- [Green] Heaney.

477
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,700
- [Verano] Oh, my God!
- Fuck.

478
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,300
- Sarge? Oh, my God. [sobbing]
- Sarge?

479
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,600
[Verano] I wanna go home!

480
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,900
Oh, fuck.

481
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,300
[sobbing] Oh, fuck!

482
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,000
- Get away from the hole.
- I'm not fucking leaving him!

483
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,800
- Look at me, sarge.
- Get the fuck away
from the hole.

484
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

485
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,000
- [gunshots]
- [screaming]

486
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,000
- How long have they been gone?
- Way too long. Way too long.

487
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Just keep some cover, all right?
Keep your eyes open.

488
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,200
Shh. You hear that?

489
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,600
Over there.

490
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,300
They're coming.

491
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,900
[gunfire]

492
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,600
Lidford, get in the hole!

493
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,100
Motherfuckers, come on!
Come on, motherfuckers!
Fuck you!

494
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,900
Come on, piece of shit.
Fuck you!

495
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,900
Ah! Shit!

496
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,300
Come on,
get your ass down now!

497
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,300
[Harris] Let's go!

498
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,200
[speaking Vietnamese]

499
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,000
[screaming]

500
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,700
I've been here over a year now,
and I can't get used to it.

501
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,800
- How many deaths have you seen?
- I don't want to talk
about that.

502
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,200
I don't want
to talk about that.

503
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,600
Where are you from?

504
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,000
- Do you have any family?
- You're cool with me.

505
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,400
I don't want
to talk about that.

506
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,900
[gunfire]

507
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
Come on, Graybridge!

508
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,500
- Stay there!
