1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,399
June 1991
Yugoslavia falls apart.

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,277
First night of
a forgotten truck.

3
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,876
A secret place.
Specially made.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,995
Neither God nor Allah
would find it, huh?

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,716
As if a magician made it.

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,708
I trust you.
But, if you insist...

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,908
- You also get a bonus.
- You're more than fair.

8
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,159
- From Cobe.
- A bonus? There's no need.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,670
A bonus for you, too.
Compliments of Veljo.

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,714
Brothers, thank you
and cheers.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,594
Why'd you kill us,
you dirty bastards!?

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,830
- Shame on you!
- Shut the fuck up!

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,239
You kiss and stab
at the same time!

14
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,879
My guts, they're
all spilled out.

15
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,992
Hold on,
don't be a sissy!

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,476
Oh, poor me,
I just got the limo.

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,393
I put them all back in.
I'll live.

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,194
No chance.

19
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,756
Oh, Mother, oh, my limo!

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,719
Here, fuck your Kraut car.

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,359
It's enough you killed me,
but why scratch my car!?

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,668
Look, these guys
are finished!

23
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,559
What a mess!

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,833
Cute guy!
Like he's alive!

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,479
Don't get upset.
We can't help them.

26
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,275
But, they might help us.

27
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,394
We've got more cash
than the government.

28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,716
- What should we do now?
- I got an idea.

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,919
Let's open a club somewhere,
on the coast, far away.

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,399
We'll leave Hooker St. forever.

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,191
THE RED COLOURED GREY TRUCK

32
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,508
"My room is too small."

33
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,275
"There's no place for lies."

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,878
"All that's important
is within me."

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,714
"This is not a place for us..."

36
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,716
'Good morning, pretty boy!'
Ratko Cvoro!

37
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,199
Still not ready?

38
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,798
Nutcase! 3 years for stealing
trucks. Just for joy rides!

39
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,437
- You don't get it.
- Seems he doesn't wanna go out.

40
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,679
Crazy! Totally!
Certified!

41
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,038
What's the word for it?

42
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,033
You mean colour blindness?
It's something else.

43
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,435
I'm ready.

44
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,714
Doc, all the best.
You too, Rambo.

45
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,631
- Don't abuse Doc too much.
- Fuck you, asshole.

46
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,236
And lay off the trucks!

47
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,958
"From the spring,
two paths spread apart..."

48
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,997
"Watch out, which one
you take, my friend."

49
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,996
Suzanna Medenica!

50
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,275
"Slovenian police..."

51
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,593
"Controls the airports
since this morning."

52
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,634
What will happen to
my house in Porec?

53
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,310
The one next to
Restaurant Anchor.

54
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,551
Well, Suzanna...

55
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,591
You're pregnant.

56
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,435
That's impossible!
It must be a mistake!

57
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,039
No, it's not!

58
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,910
- When can I have an abortion?
- In 3 weeks.

59
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,799
Are you crazy?
What am I going to do?

60
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,551
Is abortion what you want?

61
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,112
- What are you talking about?
- It's up to you.

62
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,236
To Dubrovnik, are you nuts?

63
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,593
- Where's my money?
- You see what's happening?

64
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,836
Country's falling apart.

65
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,634
- War may break out.
- I don't give a shit!

66
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,838
- Where's my money?!
- It's in a safe place.

67
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,269
You drank up 2000 marks?

68
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,836
I invested it in General's
private bank.

69
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,950
In a year,
you'll have 6240 marks.

70
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,792
In a year I'll have
6240 dicks. You stupid...

71
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,318
I'll draw, sing, do anything,
but I'm leaving.

72
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,118
Over my dead body.

73
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,078
Planning any more kids?
I'm the one too many!

74
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,471
I'll have the army police
arrest you!

75
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,071
Don't get killed till
you give me my money back.

76
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:10,834
"And the audience
started cheering..."

77
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,718
"Come on, Bruce Lee,
strike him, Bruce Lee..."

78
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,478
"Don't let
the scumbags live..."

79
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,198
Faggot!

80
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,595
Join us, babe!

81
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,029
Bastard!

82
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,599
Oh my, what'll I do now?!

83
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,109
- Good.
- What's good, you moron?!

84
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,315
- You're not dead. - What?
- You didn't die.

85
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,796
- You disappointed?
- Not at all. Good.

86
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,992
Better than good - great!

87
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,794
If you died,
I'd be totally fucked up.

88
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,479
Fucked up?

89
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,751
I'm fucked up even
when I run a dog over.

90
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,110
You'll be fucked up
when I call the cops.

91
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,474
Please, don't.
Let's move away.

92
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,670
Chill out.

93
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,436
You're fine,
it's just this little, here...

94
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,236
Shit! It may leave a scar!

95
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,437
It's nothing.
You could've died!

96
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,829
You moronic idiot!
- Stop it, girl!

97
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,516
Fuck! You clumsy fool!

98
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,757
If you don't want the cops,
drive me to the coast.

99
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,232
No way!
I never pick up anyone!

100
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,200
What's your trip, man?

101
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,476
Why are you driving
in your socks?

102
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,479
I feel the pedals better.

103
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,192
That's not mine.

104
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,831
The truck's not mine.

105
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,272
- Where are we going?
- To Dubrovnik.- Dubrovnik?

106
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,038
- Is there a problem?
- I couldn't care less.

107
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,032
What are you driving?

108
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:03,156
A truck. Mercedes Benz,
1989, B type, 1 65 HP.

109
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,517
- I mean, what are you carrying?
- Oh, that.

110
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,269
No idea.

111
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,595
"lf I lived 1,000 years..."

112
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,958
"My whole life
would fit into a day"

113
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:59,036
"A single call changes all."

114
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,475
What is it? Speak!

115
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,719
Maybe you got a concussion.

116
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,670
Not on the seat covers!
Want me to hold your head?

117
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,518
- I'll kill you.
- Good.

118
00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:03,748
"Oh my Bosniaaa...
beautiful and faaair"

119
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,196
- I can't stand it anymore!
- What!? - I can't hold it!

120
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,834
- What?!
- Quick, I need to pee!

121
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,268
- I'll stop. - I can't pee
anywhere, you Bosnian peasant!

122
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,159
- You can go behind a bush!

123
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,352
- I'm not one of your cowgirls.

124
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,672
Take me to a loo!

125
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,199
- Just don't get us killed!
- I'll show you who's a peasant!

126
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,918
Fuck you, moron!

127
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,438
"- What's your name?"
- Boris..."

128
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,756
"What's up, Boris,
you been captured?"

129
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,552
"Yes, we are."

130
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,509
"- Are you terrified?
- Yes, we are."

131
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,035
Fuck!

132
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,949
"Why is this battle
being fought?"

133
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,438
"No idea.
As far as I can tell,"

134
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,875
"They, kind of,
want to break away,"

135
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,393
"We, kind of,
won't let them."

136
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,875
- I feel shitty.
-I'll help you, just tell me how?

137
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,239
Shall I get you an ice cream?

138
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,359
You are some moron.
But, it's nice of you.

139
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,074
- Ok, get me an ice cream.
- Which one?

140
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,036
I hate making choices.
I'll take this red one.

141
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,752
Which one,
you have to show me.

142
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,677
- You don't see it?
- I'm colour blind.

143
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,071
I can't recognize colours.
It's all black and white.

144
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,034
- You're bullshitting me?
- I swear on Tito.

145
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,074
It's like in the song:
"It's a black-and-white world."

146
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,435
- lce boy! Over here!
- Nothing but turbo-folk junk!

147
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,473
What sick fucks listen to this?!

148
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,469
- Stop dragging me!
- You want us killed?

149
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,077
Because I don't
like their crap music?!

150
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,039
You don't understand.

151
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,957
"Kiss - my - ass."

152
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,993
I am Ratko the Bosnian dork,
all this around me is a

153
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,318
"black-and-white world..."

154
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,869
- What are you doing?
- "Chucking my shitty shoes."

155
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,833
You are crazy, throwing
away such nice sandals.

156
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,194
- What colour are my toenails?
- I don't know.

157
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,674
- What colour is the truck?
- Grey, like everything else.

158
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,793
- I thought about it a lot.
- And?

159
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,713
Maybe you should see it
my way. Grey.

160
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,150
- But things have colours.
- How can you tell?

161
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,952
We who see colours are many.
You colour-blind are few.

162
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,839
That's why we're normal,
and you're sick.

163
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,353
Just because
we are outnumbered...

164
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,148
"There were incidents
between Slovenian police

165
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,512
"and the YU army in Postojina."

166
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,797
"Slovenian police
spread leaflets,"

167
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,757
"Welcome to Slovenia."

168
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,034
You're right, fuck the news.

169
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,758
Check it out,
some fancy booze.

170
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,560
What a bottle... American.
Want some?

171
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,676
It's better than
your drugs and shit.

172
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,193
Cut the crap.

173
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,789
No problem,
every dog has its day.

174
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,798
You mean
"every cat has its day".

175
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,790
Maybe that's what you say.
We say "every dog has its day".

176
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,432
Whatever.
I don't wanna argue.

177
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,071
Shit!
Tastes like a piss!

178
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,513
Throw it out!

179
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,758
Hey, you! Truck!

180
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,396
- What happened?
- Man, what a blast!

181
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,034
I don't get it. What "BONUS"?

182
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,193
Look how many fish.
Wait, I'll pay!

183
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,235
Some freak is after us.

184
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,150
Oh God, gimme some
more dynamite!

185
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,549
Dynamite, you deaf fuck!

186
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,235
Look! Cool!

187
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,399
Rock 'n roll has made
it to this shit-hole!

188
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,477
It's not a shit-hole,
it's Podrinje.

189
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:37,119
Oh, Podrinje, fuck me
if you see me again.

190
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,755
What was that graffiti?

191
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,029
Guns 'n Roses, Rock 'n roll,
Appetite for Destruction!

192
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,918
Civilisation, you fuck!

193
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,793
Guns 'n Roses!

194
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:27,111
"My Bosniaaa,
beautiful and fair."

195
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:37,670
"And my town of Banja Luka,
more than I can bear."

196
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,716
- What a singer!
-Of course I sing, I'm in Bosnia.

197
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,355
As if it were Hollywood.

198
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,997
You bet.
Just look at this beauty.

199
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,478
When you're colour blind,
Bosnia is Disneyland.

200
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,359
You'll get to your coast!

201
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,799
"Latif agaaaa... travelled
faaaar..."

202
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,599
Watch out, it's red!

203
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,509
Can't you see the red light!

204
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,749
Fucking red. That's why they
won't give me the license.

205
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,995
Luckily, he didn't slide away.

206
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,832
- Luckily he's dead.
- What's lucky, idiot!?

207
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,674
Luckily he was already dead.

208
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,151
If he were alive,
I wouldn't be burying him.

209
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,989
Beat it before I axe you. Oh,
Danga, I fixed you real nice.

210
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,239
And now you're all fucked up.

211
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,157
- Hey, he looks like a model!
- Don't touch him!

212
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,277
- Why did you do that?
- Kill me if I know.

213
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,233
I wouldn't, but you forced me.

214
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,998
No, I'd never force you
to kill me. Honestly.

215
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,673
Liar, you're one of them!
Why did you touch him?

216
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,354
Hold on, I'm not one of them!

217
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,710
I'm not from here. It makes
no sense to kill me! Right?

218
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,309
Wrong.

219
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,758
I can help, take you and Danga
wherever you want?

220
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,915
We need to take Danga home.
He dated one of their girls.

221
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,310
and "accidentally"
got shot at a party.

222
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,472
I need to take him
back home. Get it?

223
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,952
A lollypop for my boy.

224
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,553
Where'd you disappear to?

225
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,275
Me?! You kept on babbling
with that man.

226
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,634
All right, let's go.

227
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,833
I got everything.
You just pay.

228
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,919
- What's this?
- 2200.

229
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,515
Give us two sausages
and some bread.

230
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,874
- I'm not eating that shit.
- OK. Then this.

231
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,197
No, it's your money,
you take what you want.

232
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,672
- Cut the bullshit! - Take
that talk to your cowgirls!

233
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,757
2,250. Just for you.

234
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,353
Sh-she stole a
ch-ch-chocolate banana.

235
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,471
What you lookin' at, you idiot!

236
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,314
Would anyone explain
this to me?

237
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,830
This is Danga,
this is cousin Butt.

238
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,196
- What's wrong with him?
- Love killed him.

239
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,316
The man is drunk.

240
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,032
Stop, I want to get out!

241
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,352
Danga won't hurt you.
I'm holding him.

242
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,392
Where do you get off?

243
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,151
Top of that hill.

244
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,351
Always chased skirt, Danga,
even dead you can't resist.

245
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,475
His days are over. Now we're
all into guns, not dicks.

246
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,560
Don't be afraid.
Good boy, Danga, good boy!

247
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,636
Pull over there.
Get him out.

248
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,594
Oh, back in Tito's time...

249
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,873
You screwed around,
no questions asked.

250
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,315
Good luck!

251
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,069
You'll need it.

252
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:08,838
"Oh, Danga, you poor bastard,
their young pussy killed you."

253
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,475
So what if he was
from another village?

254
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,476
Forget it...

255
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,629
Why are you
going to Dubrovnik?

256
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,309
To chill out on the coast.

257
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,919
Since I'm broke,
I'm going to sell some.

258
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,680
drawings in Dubrovnik,
or sing, or do portraits.

259
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,397
You draw?

260
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,834
-Let me see.
-It's dark.

261
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,395
Doesn't matter
I won't see the colours anyway.

262
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,388
You're right.

263
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,391
Shit, you're an artist.

264
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,391
This is trash,
it's copied from postcards.

265
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,314
No, still,
I like this one the best.

266
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,036
- If only you'd see colours.
- Would you sell it to me?

267
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,116
I'll give it to you.
When we get there.

268
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,230
Bagna di Luca.

269
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,914
- Banja-Luka-upon-the-sea?!
Where's that?

270
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,877
- In ltaly.

271
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,918
You draw nice.
You also sing nice.

272
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,752
You're kind of nice.

273
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,031
All of you.

274
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:29,959
- What's that?
- I don't know.

275
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,315
- Got a cigarette, bro?
- Sure, for a fellow driver.

276
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,995
- Belgrade plates?
- Wait, here's a snack.

277
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,988
- What are you carrying?
- Toilets, bathtubs...

278
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,993
Furniture from generals' homes.

279
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,510
- From Slovenia. Evacuation.
- No shit?

280
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,870
- Where to?
- Dubrovnik.

281
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,991
- Forget it!

282
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,838
They control the roads.

283
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,349
There's no way
through Herzegovina.

284
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,269
-I love pickles! Thanks.
Good luck! - You, too.

285
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,670
- How much left to discharge?
- 32 days!

286
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,111
Then I split. This country
won't see me again!

287
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,229
Did you do your
military service?

288
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,914
I flunked the medical. Why?

289
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,913
No reason. Good night.

290
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,188
Good night.

291
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:58,757
"Oh my dreamy meadow
is waking..."

292
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,235
Good morning, rockers!

293
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,755
Where are we going?

294
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,669
No idea.
What do you think?

295
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,112
Don't bullshit me.
You heard the kid last night?

296
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,479
I think he made it all up.
To show off in front of you.

297
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,273
Not all of it.

298
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,988
He sure added a lot.

299
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,515
We're talking about
the State, the Army,

300
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,319
not some truckers joint.

301
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,675
I don't believe it. I know
discipline, law and order.

302
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,348
Slow down, let's check it out.

303
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,678
- Shit, the kid wasn't lying.
- What do we do now?

304
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,111
There's a crossroad ahead.

305
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,518
I was thinking...
about avoiding Herzegovina.

306
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,629
If you can go elsewhere
to the coast.

307
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,400
Up North. It's calmer there.

308
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,478
Like lstria, Porec?

309
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,271
Porec is good, or ltaly.
Just think, ltaly.

310
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,589
Fiat making trucks with Volvo.
The highways...

311
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,955
- It's pedal to the metal.
- I don't have a passport.

312
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,792
I don't have it either,
but I can get it.

313
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,230
I got to be in Belgrade
in two weeks.

314
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,992
But, Porec is cool. There's
a summer house there.

315
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,670
The owner's not there.
A gynaecologist.

316
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,198
- Put that shit away.
- It's just grass.

317
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,228
- Don't want that shit in
my truck! - It's not your truck.

318
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,958
What do you think
you're doing!

319
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,958
You'll fuck it all up!

320
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,830
Now we're safe.
There's no trouble here.

321
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,517
Come on, find the ball,
Hunchback pays all.

322
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,789
- Middle one!
- Don't!

323
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,634
- Move your hands!

324
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,439
Fuck!

325
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,679
Think you can cheat me,
you humped piece of shit!

326
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,953
Don't, please, sir! That's my
whole week's earnings.

327
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,158
Boss, look over there.
There!

328
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,918
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

329
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,108
- Is it hot?
- Only a bit.

330
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,997
"The air is quivering
as if the sky were on fire."

331
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,916
"A storm is brewing."

332
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,999
- Cobe sent you?
- Maybe.

333
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,429
-Maybe what? - Maybe he did,
maybe he didn't.

334
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,715
Everyone's trying to
fuck me today.

335
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,792
- Get out!
- No problem.

336
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,795
Who do you think you are?

337
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,588
You, shut up or we'll
fuck you in the ass!

338
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,832
Instantly!
All four of us!

339
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,432
Once again.
I said:

340
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,313
"The air is quivering
as if the sky were on fire."

341
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,914
- And what did you say?
- "A storm is brewing."

342
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,908
- So: Cobe sent you.
- Yes.

343
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,838
See? It wasn't difficult.
Cobe sent him. Shoot him.

344
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,396
No, he didn't, I have no idea
who the guy is!

345
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,349
Elvis, search the truck!

346
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,199
Just say, Cobe sent me
to deliver weapons

347
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,033
for the Upper Outcrop!
Fuck you bastards!

348
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,913
- What you talking about?
- You knew the password twice.

349
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,318
"Walter defends Sarajevo"?
I saw the movie five times.

350
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,670
Just one more minute.

351
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,117
If you have arms, I'll kill you.
If not, I'll do the same.

352
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,189
- Nothing here, boss.
- Nothing?

353
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,389
- Can we make a deal?
- Just shut up!

354
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,439
We made a mistake.

355
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,354
I apologize, but
we still have to kill you.

356
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,553
There's no reason to!
Don't you have a heart?

357
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,037
- Who are you with?
- Just me and the girl.

358
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,990
The question was: are you
one us or one of them?!

359
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,069
- Us.
- And who is us?

360
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,510
We're all the same to me.
A man is a man; a dick is a dick.

361
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,911
Well, we're all the same,
except for our dicks.

362
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,513
Drop your pants!

363
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,836
No fucking way!

364
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,757
What is it, panic?

365
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,476
When you see the python,
you'll be fucked up.

366
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,600
I'm quitting grass for sure!

367
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,599
I want it as a souvenir.

368
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,397
You should be ashamed.

369
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,154
For all of us,
this man is: Tito.

370
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:51,030
Mister, whoever you are,
welcome to Koka's territory!

371
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,991
Sorry, I'm Koka.
And, my respects!

372
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,835
- Let's go!
- Have a nice day!

373
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,874
What? Running away,
you chicken shit?!

374
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,475
I'm gonna call my dad...

375
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,399
He'll send the Air Force,
to break your balls!

376
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,275
Oh, my.. Elvis,
go slash the tyre.

377
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,468
I'm sorry. In general,
we're nice people.

378
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,671
It's just this situation.

379
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,436
If you ever come to
Lower Outcrop,

380
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,670
I have a restaurant, "Monaco".

381
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,670
We have kebab, this big!
For you, they'll be for free.

382
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,233
Good luck! And please
don't take it personally!

383
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,432
- You're not mad at me?
- What do you think?

384
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,158
Fuck, you know what
you've been carrying?

385
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,115
We're lucky they
didn't find it.

386
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,592
- What's that?
- What?

387
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,959
- Some kind of a forest gnome!
- I don't take hitch-hikers.

388
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,469
- It's a hunchback.
- No way?

389
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,478
Hunchback, you son of a bitch!

390
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,952
I don't believe it!
They let you out already?

391
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,475
Same old you,
just the backpack is growing.

392
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,316
- Who beat you up? -Don't ask.
Can you give me a ride?

393
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,838
- Of course.
- Who's the pussy there?

394
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,675
- Better behave yourself!
- No problem. You know me.

395
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,952
I do, that's why.

396
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,752
- Sorry, did I squeeze you?
- Your squeezing is no problem.

397
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,315
I wouldn't mind being
squeezed by tits.

398
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,991
- As if they were some tits.
- Tits are tits.

399
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,590
I didn't know
I was a con artist type.

400
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,075
You're anyone's type,
but my friend Ratko here.

401
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,236
He only gets turned on
by trucks.

402
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,711
Hunchback,
where do you get off?

403
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,629
You better get outta here.
Both of you.

404
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,591
- We're not together.
- Doesn't matter.

405
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,192
You might wake up with a
bullet in your head.

406
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,870
- Want some seeds?
- No, thanks.

407
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,636
Everybody's giving gold
for a rifle now.

408
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,991
- Really?
- Yeah.

409
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:58,437
- Anyone of ours do guns?
- Kraut does.

410
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,630
He's the one.
Smuggles guns, people.

411
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,950
Has a merry-go-round.
In Drekavica. Why?

412
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,673
Just asking.

413
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,874
If I weren't a hunchback,
I'd ask you to marry me.

414
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,752
So what if you have a hump?
You're charming, cute...

415
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,391
You mean good for...

416
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,835
Hunchback, what the fuck
you think you're doing?

417
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,952
- It's a joke. What got into you?
- What got into me?!

418
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:42,958
"A fisherman fished...
And caught a goldfish..."

419
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:54,671
"lt said: I'll fulfil you a wish.
You'll live your life..."

420
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,198
"...Iike no one of your kin,
in true happiness and joy."

421
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,236
Thanks for the ride.
Take good care of this kid!

422
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,953
This Hunchback guy is
a genius.

423
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,310
- ldiot.
- What about you?

424
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,273
Then why didn't you stay
with him?

425
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:39,278
He's funny, cracks jokes,
he's not a bore like you.

426
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,836
This isn't Belgrade, you can't
fool around like that.

427
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,270
Who are you to tell me
how to behave?!

428
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,354
You think you can run
my life, moron?!

429
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:56,035
- I'm not your fucking truck!
- Leave my truck alone.

430
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,795
Why didn't you stay with him?
If he is a genius.

431
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,598
I'm not with you, I'm
just riding with you. Clear?!

432
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,910
I didn't ask you to ride with me.

433
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,318
I've had enough of your shit.
I'm going back to Belgrade!

434
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,511
- Pull over there!
- You want me to pull over?

435
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,517
Yes!

436
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,031
You should go and see a doctor!

437
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,070
You're jealous of a midget!

438
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,108
You're totally mad! Junky!

439
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:21,436
"Oh, lord, won't you
to buy me a Mercedes Benz..."

440
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,112
Fucking seeds...

441
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,512
She's over here!

442
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:26,870
- Don't be afraid, sweetie-pie!
- May we help you, in any way?

443
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,470
- I'll call the police!
- Police, no shit?!

444
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,278
My father is an officer.
He'll kill you!

445
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,434
Lovers always fight!

446
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,996
- I'm gonna scream!
- Go ahead! I love screamers.

447
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,676
What are you waiting for?!
An invitation? Get in!

448
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,112
BONUS! Give them a "bonus"!

449
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,832
- I'm afraid.
- Of what?

450
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,630
Of everything.

451
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,120
There's no reason.
It's my fault.

452
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,229
Look what you look like!

453
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,071
- What do I look like?

454
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,596
Like shit.

455
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,437
I'm sorry.

456
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,152
Stop apologizing, you moron.

457
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,550
I am not a nurse. I can't
stand blood and that shit.

458
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,600
Don't get my hair sticky
with your mess.

459
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,838
Let's go to the lake
to wash up.

460
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,159
Thank God you got rid
of that tacky shirt.

461
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,278
It's a nice shirt,
nothing wrong with it.

462
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,790
What is this, a Peace sign?

463
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,474
It's not a Peace,
it's a Mercedes sign.

464
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,631
Are you crazy,
want to get an infection?

465
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,872
What colour is my belly button?

466
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,034
Wait here.

467
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,119
Put it on.

468
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,229
I don't want that shit.
No way!

469
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,510
Try it, maybe
you'll see colours.

470
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,954
- What do you mean?
- Try it. You've got a chance.

471
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,913
You'll be fine,
it's only grass.

472
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,028
- I won't become a junkie?
- You won't.

473
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,508
On the contrary...

474
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,632
if you don't smoke grass,
you'll become a junkie.

475
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,153
I don't get it.

476
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,028
Marijuana and alcohol
are light drugs.

477
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,077
Everything else is hard drugs.

478
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,478
Politics, news,
war-mongering, cocaine,

479
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,073
heroin, turbo- folk,
democracy, communism...

480
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,910
All that shit is hard drugs.

481
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,957
Compared to that,
this is a child's play.

482
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,758
A way to stay normal.
Get it?

483
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,712
You're such a scholar!

484
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,715
Wait! Is this it?!
Colours?

485
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,358
Look at that!

486
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,353
Man, an old hit
from your parts!

487
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,470
Come here.

488
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,078
- Who, me?
- You.

489
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,115
I see glitters.
Like stars.

490
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:48,555
I see large fires...
Like haystacks on fire.

491
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,032
It's growing.

492
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,508
I can hear fireworks.

493
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,318
What are you doing?

494
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,992
Drawing your tattoo,
dragon or whatever.

495
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,592
A python.
But I'm not like that.

496
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,952
The first truck I drove, a Volvo,
had a python on the hood.

497
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:57,269
I wanted to show off
I could take the pain.

498
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,314
- It's silly.
- Why silly? It's cool.

499
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:07,749
That's why I never wanted
to do it with a girl, until now.

500
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,670
You are definitely
the weirdest guy.

501
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,593
Will you marry me?

502
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,993
You're not weird,
you're nuts.

503
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,070
Don't be cruel
to the man who loves you.

504
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,431
I am sick again.

505
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,231
I've got an idea!

506
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,154
It's OK.
Have some ink?

507
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,435
- I've got lndia ink.
- Great. Give it to me.

508
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,634
- Why do you need it?

509
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,510
- For a tattoo machine!
- Tattoo?

510
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,190
You said it was cool.

511
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,230
It doesn't hurt.
Just stings a little.

512
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,078
Fuck you!

513
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,117
I'll do mine first,
you'll see it's nothing.

514
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,272
- What's that? - A tear,
the symbol of your name.

515
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,677
- On your shoulder?
- No, please! Don't...

516
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,391
I can't stand pain.
Please, don't...

517
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:54,999
- I want to go home.
- Forget about it.

518
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,397
Let's go straight to ltaly.
Fuck Porec.

519
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,989
I don't have a passport,
and I don't have money.

520
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,794
We've got those guns,
we'll find Kraut.

521
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,076
Don't worry, Ratko will
take care of everything.

522
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,155
Wait, somebody's coming!
Hide your arms!

523
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,990
Move over!

524
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,716
- What's the matter?
- Move over!

525
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,551
You should feel good with me.

526
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,878
I'll let you try. I wouldn't
do it for nobody else.

527
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,438
Try what?
You got some stuff?

528
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,549
- I'm gonna teach you to
drive a truck. - A truck?

529
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,119
Mercedes Benz.
Get behind the wheel.

530
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,511
It'll change everything.
You'll feel great.

531
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,675
When you hear the roar of
the motor... Fuck life!

532
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,794
Fuck life.

533
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,712
Push down the clutch, there.
OK, that's it.

534
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,153
Now, slowly, release it...

535
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,952
Way to go! Look ahead!

536
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,518
- You're driving!
- Oh, man...

537
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,997
That's my song!

538
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,235
The clutch, third gear!
There you go!

539
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,354
Look out!
Not into the field!

540
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,114
Watch the peasants!

541
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,876
Good. We're back on the road.
Just go straight.

542
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,277
- I've had enough.
- We've only started.

543
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,394
Way to go!

544
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,278
Look out! Brake!

545
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,436
- Fuck, I killed a priest.
- Why don't you watch out!

546
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,394
- Were you baptised?
- It's your fault!

547
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,319
If you weren't, it doesn't
matter he was a priest.

548
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,278
It's like killing anyone.

549
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,394
If I killed him I'll be screwed.
Because I believe in God.

550
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,359
Shut up, it's your fault!
You blind fuck!

551
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,593
Bastard!

552
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,752
- Maybe you didn't kill him.
- No way. He was old.

553
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,957
At least he didn't die young.

554
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,192
Maybe he's not dead.
Go check it out.

555
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,393
- Me? What if he isn't dead?
- What do you mean?

556
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:21,030
- I'm embarrassed.
- You're a sissy, like all men!

557
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,952
A python's no use,
you don't have the balls!

558
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,429
I've been driving for years,
and never killed anyone!

559
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,838
But you screw up everything!
That's all you ever do!

560
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,230
Let go of me!
You fucking dork!

561
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:46,757
- Children!
- Father, fuck, you're alive!

562
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,996
Children, what are you doing?

563
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,029
You should not fight.

564
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,510
- "He who loves shall be saved".
- And those who have dough.

565
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:15,512
My godless child, the beauty
of the world here, and yet...

566
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,679
Misfortune is still to come.
The question is...

567
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,196
If we'll make it: you - to run
away, me - to prevent misfortune.

568
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,195
-You know why? - Even God
kissed this place good-bye.

569
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,871
- Something like that. But, why?
- How should I know?

570
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,350
God cannot hear us because of
our Julian calendar.

571
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,709
We and the Russians observe
our calendar, and look at us.

572
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,597
Greeks, also Orthodox,
observe the new calendar.

573
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,314
God hears them.
They are doing fine.

574
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:03,118
When I pray to St. Elijah
on his day... he is not there.

575
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,829
He was there two weeks ago.

576
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,597
Like a bad connection.

577
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,837
Aren't we right?
With our old calendar?

578
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,635
Dumbo. Like an old phonebook.
You dial wrong numbers.

579
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,908
I told you. Our prayers
don't reach up there.

580
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,758
Go away to where God
can hear you!

581
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,070
This is it. The oak tree with
the inscription is there.

582
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,915
It's a curse to cut it.
I have to stop them.

583
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,635
- How will you do that?
- By God's word.

584
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,516
- Sorry to have hit you.
- It is nothing.

585
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,756
Here you are.
To be heard better.

586
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,154
- It is not German?
- No, it's Russian.

587
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,075
OK then.
Run away, children!

588
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,676
God, understand if you can...
And if you are there.

589
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,475
The tree is on our land!
The border's here!

590
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,159
No, the tree is the border! If
we can't have it, we'll cut it!

591
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,875
People, listen to me!

592
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,040
This is nothing, compared
to what might happen.

593
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,157
Do not tempt the devil!

594
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,995
For if you do,
he will screw all of us!

595
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:21,277
You get it, Anti-Christs?

596
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,788
What's this,
another Peace sign?

597
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,800
This is my father. Slavoljub.

598
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,633
Dad, this is Suzanna,
she'll be my wife.

599
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,879
See what the scum have done.

600
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,078
That's my Slavoljub,
always on the move.

601
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,154
I have to tell you something.

602
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:33,552
I don't remember him.
He was killed when I was a kid.

603
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,116
Later, my mother
left with another man.

604
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,876
- He loved her very much.
And strangled her. - Fuck!

605
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,793
That happens a lot here.
People are passionate.

606
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,914
Ratko, listen..

607
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:55,159
I feel bad to leave him here
where they desecrate his grave.

608
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,114
- Dad, we're off to ltaly.
- That's not his grave?

609
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,238
Who would know that?

610
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,915
He was driving a gas tanker.

611
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,830
A school bus came round the bend,
crossed over to his side.

612
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,397
To avoid the bus, Slavoljub
turned this way and boom!

613
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,232
Nothing left to bury.

614
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:29,791
Firm offered to bury an empty
coffin...Ma just took the money.

615
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,838
The steering wheel was
the only thing left.

616
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,991
So in a way...this is his grave.

617
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,999
Local people say
that at night...

618
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,993
When someone's in trouble

619
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:46,711
Slavoljub appears
in his tanker to help.

620
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,118
Listen to me now!

621
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,471
I'm not gonna be your wife,
I'm not going to ltaly with you!

622
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,673
I'm pregnant, I need to be
back in Belgrade.

623
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,871
in two weeks
to have an abortion.

624
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,634
We're going to have a baby?
Already?

625
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,189
- No!! - That's great!
- I want to go home!

626
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,070
Italy, palm trees, a beach,
just like in your picture.

627
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,916
And us, with a baby...
We'll never come back here!

628
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,270
Ok, ok, we're leaving...

629
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,870
I don't want
to leave my Dad here.

630
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,233
Boss!

631
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,876
- Hi, Kraut!
- Hi, Ratko, old man!

632
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:30,638
Great... We're gonna
wipe each other out.

633
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:52,396
The chick is a candy.
And you're smart to leave.

634
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:59,073
It's too tense here.
It can blow up any minute.

635
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,716
And those abroad
only make things worse.

636
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,270
A payback for screwing
their bitches.

637
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,788
Cheers.

638
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,200
Luckily they didn't
dress you in uniform.

639
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,510
I can't tell colours apart.

640
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,359
Doesn't matter.
Civil war has no colours.

641
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,916
That's the beauty of it -
not knowing who's who!

642
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,995
- Good?
- You bet it is.

643
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,193
Whatever people need
to be happy, I provide.

644
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,716
Merry-go-rounds, lollipops
or machine guns.

645
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:56,231
- I like to see happy faces.
It's the way I am. - You are.

646
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:06,314
- I better push off. - Wait!
How'll you get to the border?

647
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,679
Give me that map.

648
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,276
Roadblocks are everywhere.

649
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,315
You pay your way with arms.

650
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,599
Here, at Bear's Claw,
you tell them:

651
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,588
Simo sent you, and give them
1 00 eggs, 5,6 chickens

652
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:28,470
-...1 0 hens. - What are you
talking about? What eggs?

653
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,628
Eggs are bullets, chicks are
pistols, hens are rifles.

654
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,273
- Where is it? - Here.
- No, you lose again.

655
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:48,112
Here you say, Hasan sent you,
Give them 100 - 5 - 10.

656
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:57,349
And here you say Stipe,
and give them a 100 - 20 - 20.

657
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,912
Take care, there are two Kraut
mercenaries. Dangerous guys.

658
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:13,673
Keep the explosive for the end,
for the ltalian border.

659
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,750
You're cheating!

660
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,035
Run man, shit has started!

661
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,596
I don't like the face
of this guy. Let's kill him.

662
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,036
But look at the truck,
Mercedes Benz, 1 21 3.

663
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,869
My brother and l
drove a red one like that.

664
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,553
I can't kill him.

665
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,151
Hans, what's the matter
with you?

666
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,355
I can't kill a man who
drives a red Mercedes truck.

667
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,152
OK, I'll do it.

668
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,394
If you kill him, I'll kill you.

669
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,391
Want some water?

670
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,557
Want to wash up?

671
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:30,757
- You feel sick?
- Yes, I feel sick.

672
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,112
I'm sick of everything,
I just want out of this.

673
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,475
We'll be at the border
in two hours.

674
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:46,195
I want to go back home.
I'm scared and I'm cold.

675
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,474
There's no way back now.

676
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,069
We made a deal,
no way back now.

677
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,158
- I'll run off on you.
- Not a chance.

678
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:10,629
I'll kidnap you,
take you by force.

679
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,758
Suzanna!... Suzanna!

680
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,640
Out of the way, moron!
Fine, if you want it.

681
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,353
Where's the other one?

682
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:23,076
- What's this?
- Love, honey... Iove.

683
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,714
- But what's that rumble?

684
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,708
Fuck! War!
Let's get out of here!

685
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,791
The second gear!

686
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:18,156
The third one!
That's my girl!

687
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:29,876
- I'm sorry I ran you over.
- Forget it, we say:

688
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,797
"lf they don't kill each other,
it's not true love."

689
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,111
-Ratko- Huh?
-I need to pee.

690
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,149
Can't you wait until ltaly?
We're close.

691
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,076
- What an ass!
- It is.

692
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,192
Look at him.
Redneck!

693
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,074
Fuck!

694
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,428
Move!
The army's attacking!

695
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:36,314
"The train from Vienna,
via Trieste, to Ljubljana."

696
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,597
"Zagreb and Belgrade,
is departing immediately."

697
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,231
How is this possible?

698
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,234
Because this is love.
Don't ask.

699
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,953
I have to tell you something.

700
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,350
Ratko Junior is black.

701
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,796
It's all the same to me.
Colours mean nothing to me.

702
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,072
This film is dedicated to all those
who see things in a different way.
