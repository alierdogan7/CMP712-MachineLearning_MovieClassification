00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:19,435
[Roaring]

2
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:41,851
[Man Narrating] War began between
Germany and France on August 3, 1914.

3
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,771
Five weeks later,
the German army had smashed its way...

4
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,106
to within 18 miles of Paris.

5
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,444
There, the battered French miraculously
rallied their forces at the Marne River...

6
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,780
- and in a series of unexpected counterattacks.
- [Officer] Detail, halt!

7
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,948
- Drove the Germans back.
- [Shouting Commands]

8
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,742
The front was stabilized...

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,369
then shortly afterwards developed
into a continuous line...

10
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,371
of heavily fortified trenches...

11
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,707
zigzagging their way 500 miles...

12
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,460
from the English Channel
to the Swiss frontier.

13
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,465
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare...

14
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,759
the battle lines had changed very little.

15
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,138
Successful attacks were measured
in hundreds of yards...

16
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,266
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

17
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,063
General Broulard, sir.

18
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,607
- [Laughing]
- Hello, George. How are you?

19
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,360
Paul, wonderful seeing you again.
Really wonderful.

20
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,905
Well, this is splendid. It's superb.

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,157
It's grand, very grand.

22
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,952
Well, I've tried to create
a pleasant atmosphere in which to work.

23
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,704
Well, you've succeeded marvelously.
I wish I had your taste in carpets.

24
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,456
- Oh! [Laughing]
- And pictures.

25
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,500
You're much too kind, George.
Much too kind.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,502
- Sit down, George.
- Thank you.

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:54,090
I really haven't done very much. The place
is much the same as it was when I moved in.

28
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,886
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

29
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,181
It's top secret and must go no further
than your chief of staff...

30
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,517
and not to him
unless you can trust his discretion.

31
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,935
Of course.

32
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,564
A group of armies is forming on this front
for an offensive very soon.

33
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,858
Headquarters is determined
to make a complete breakthrough.

34
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,360
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm really sorry.

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,822
I thought for just a moment I knew
what you were going to say. Please go on.

36
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,868
I never knew you were a mind reader.
What did you think I was about to say?

37
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,579
- Something about the "Anthill."
- You are a mind reader.

38
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,332
Well, it is a key position.
It's in my sector.

39
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,501
To be perfectly honest,
I've heard some talk.

40
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,920
You know, there's nothing really secret
around headquarters.

41
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,176
Well, what do you think?

42
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,924
It's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.

43
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,010
They've held on to it for a year now...

44
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,804
and it looks as though they'll hold on to it
for another year if they want to.

45
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,265
Paul, I have formal orders
to take the Anthill no later than the 10th.

46
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,546
That's the day after tomorrow.

47
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,977
That comes pretty close to
being ridiculous, don't you think?

48
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,647
I don't imagine I'd be here
if I really thought that.

49
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:56,235
[Chuckles] Paul, if there’s one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,239
It's out of the question, George.
Absolutely out of the question.

51
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,408
My division was cut to pieces.

52
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,037
What's left of it is in no position
to even hold the Anthill, let alone take it.

53
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,122
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

54
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,627
Well, Paul, there was something else
I wanted to tell you.

55
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,463
However, I'm sure that you'll misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

56
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,049
- What was it?
- Oh.

57
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,343
You'd be bound to misunderstand.

58
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,971
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

59
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,348
What are you trying to say, George?

60
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,436
Paul, talk around headquarters is that you
are being considered for the 12th Corps.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,230
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

62
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,232
Now, I've pushed it all I can.

63
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,611
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general,
and you're overdue on that star.

64
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,905
Now, we both know
that your record is good enough...

65
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,783
for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds you've stated.

66
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,785
No one would question your opinion.

67
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,329
They'd simply get someone else
to do the job.

68
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,041
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion, Paul.

69
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,046
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks, Paul, not before dinner.

70
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,887
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of8,000 men.

71
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,933
What is my ambition against that?

72
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,353
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

73
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,564
My men come first of all, George,
and those men know it too.

74
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,483
I know that they do.

75
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,653
You see, George, those men know
that I would never let them down.

76
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,405
That goes without saying.

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,699
The life of one of those soldiers
means more to me...

78
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,035
than all the stars and decorations
and honors in France.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,454
So...

80
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,333
you think this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

81
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,585
I didn't say that, George.

82
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,090
Nothing is beyond those men,
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

83
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,176
Paul, I don't want to push you into it
if you think it's ill-advised.

84
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,471
Don't worry, George.
You couldn't do that if you tried.

85
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,475
Of course, artillery would make
an enormous difference.

86
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,396
- What artillery support can you give me?
- Well, I'll see.

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,148
What about replacements?

88
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,152
We'll see what we can do, but I feel sure
that you can get along with what you have.

89
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,779
- Might just do it.
- [Chuckling] Oh, Paul.

90
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,700
I knew that I was right to come to you.
You are the man to take the Anthill.

91
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,078
- Now, as far as that star is concerned.
- That had nothing to do with my decision.

92
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,915
- If anything, it would sway me the other way.
- I realize that perfectly, Paul.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,001
Now, when do you say
you see this coming off?

94
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,378
No later than the day after tomorrow.

95
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,130
We just might do it.

96
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,238
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

97
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,240
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name, soldier?

98
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,034
Sir, Private Ferol, Company "A."

99
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,119
- Uh-huh. Are you married, Private?
- No, sir.

100
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,747
- Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,708
- Well, carry on, Private, and good luck to you.
- [Gunshot Echoes]

102
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,710
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

103
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,258
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning.

104
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,136
Hello there, soldier.
Ready to kill more Germans?

105
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,264
- Yes, sir.
- Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.

106
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,725
Well, that's the way.
It's a soldier's best friend.

107
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,228
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

108
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,230
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,984
[Chuckles]
Well, uh, good luck to you, soldier.

110
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,070
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

111
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,710
[Explosion]

112
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,348
Hello there, soldier.

113
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,892
Ready to kill more Germans?

114
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,146
Well, is everything all right, soldier?

115
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,274
All right? Yes, sir, I'm all right.

116
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,402
Aha. Good fellow.
Are you married, soldier?

117
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,113
- Married? Me, married?
- [Machine Gun Fire]

118
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,492
- Yes. Have you got a wife?
- A wife? Have I got a wife?

119
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,828
Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

120
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,832
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

121
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,378
- Have you got a wife, soldier?
- My wife?

122
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,339
My wife. Yes, I have a wife.

123
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm gonna be killed.

124
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,927
Get a grip on yourself!
You're acting like a coward!

125
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,555
- I am a coward, sir.
- Snap out of it, soldier!

126
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,601
Sergeant, I want you to arrange for the immediate
transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

127
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,270
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him!

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,772
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

129
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,155
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

130
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,365
You know, General,
I'm convinced that these tours of yours...

131
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,035
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

132
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,913
In fact, I think the fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

133
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,081
No, no, Major.
That spirit was just born in them.

134
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,833
[Both Chuckling]

135
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,462
[Machine Gun Fire In Distance]

136
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,424
The general is coming, sir.

137
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,640
[Machine Gun Fire Continues]

138
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,067
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
- I'm honored, General.

139
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,152
It's our privilege entirely.

140
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,405
- Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.
- Colonel.

141
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,408
I reserve comment on the neatness, sir,
but it is little.

142
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,411
Pretty shy on seating accommodations though.

143
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,748
More than enough for me.
I never got the habit of sitting.

144
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,501
Like to be on my feet.
[Laughs] Keep on the move.

145
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,336
I can vouch for that, Colonel.

146
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,631
I can hardly get the general behind a desk
long enough to sign an order.

147
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,758
Well, that's the way I am, you know, Dax.

148
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,761
I can't understand these armchair officers...

149
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,972
fellows trying to fight a war
from behind a desk...

150
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,974
waving papers at the enemy...

151
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,143
worrying about whether a mouse
is going to run up their pants leg.

152
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,105
I don't know, General. If I had the choice
between mice and Mausers...

153
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,107
I think I'd take the mice every time.

154
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,109
You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.

155
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,653
Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...

156
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,114
let him put on a dress
and hide under the bed.

157
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,325
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then, by heavens, he's got to be one.

158
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,495
He's got to fight, and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

159
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,622
That's my credo.

160
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,959
I think I have to agree with you,
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

161
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,253
[Major] And you've never failed
to live up to it, sir.

162
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,630
- I imagine you'd like a look around, wouldn't you?
- Yes, Colonel.

163
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,216
- [Machine Gun Fire]
- Well, here's something to see.

164
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,594
The Anthill. About as good a view
as you can get without actually being there.

165
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,972
[Laughs]
Well, that won't be long now, will it?

166
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,974
[Laughing]

167
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,728
- [Machine Gun Fire In Distance]
- Ah.

168
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,730
Ah. Yeah.

169
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,359
Well, I've seen
much more formidable objectives.

170
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,403
Much, much worse.

171
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,370
Well, not something we can grab
and run away with...

172
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,664
but certainly pregnable.

173
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,500
- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?
- Why?

174
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,003
Well, like something to do
with giving birth.

175
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,048
[Chuckling] Oh, yes. Quite. You're right
on your toes this morning, Colonel.

176
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,008
Even sharper than usual.

177
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,054
But we mustn't forget, the colonel was perhaps
the foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

178
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,098
- Of course, General.
- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

179
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,436
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

180
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,522
We drew some artillery.
Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

181
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,524
Yes, I noticed it on the road in.

182
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,651
Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

183
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,696
All swarmed together like a bunch of flies,
just waiting for someone to swat 'em.

184
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,698
[Chuckles]
Well, they never learn, it seems.

185
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,327
They get in a tight spot under heavy fire,
gang up every time.

186
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,080
Herd instinct, I suppose.
Kind of a lower-animal sort of thing.

187
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,374
Kind of a human sort of thing,
it seems to me...

188
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,501
or don't you make a distinction
between the two, Major?

189
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,046
Oh, yes, uh, very regrettable, of course.
Very. Yes, indeed.

190
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,591
Uh, Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

191
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,676
Yes, sir. Of course.

192
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,846
Colonel.

193
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,809
- [Bullets Whistling]
- [Machine Gun Fire Continues]

194
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,478
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

195
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,439
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Anthill.

196
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,818
Colonel, your regiment
is going to take the Anthill tomorrow.

197
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,238
You know the condition of my men, sir.

198
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,699
Oh, naturally, men are going to have to
be killed. Possibly a lot of them.

199
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,785
They absorb bullets and shrapnel...

200
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,329
and by doing so make it possible
for others to get through.

201
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,040
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

202
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,420
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

203
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,256
Hmm, say, five percent killed
by our own barrage.

204
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,258
That's a very generous allowance.

205
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,677
Ten percent more
in getting through no-man's-land...

206
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,971
and 20% more getting through the wire.

207
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,891
That leaves 65%
with the worst part of the job over.

208
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,979
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Anthill.

209
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,149
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

210
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,068
General, you're saying that more
than half of my men will be killed.

211
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,113
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel...

212
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,866
but we will have the Anthill.

213
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,119
- But will we, sir?
- I'm depending on you, Colonel.

214
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,204
All France is depending on you.

215
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,085
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

216
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,882
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need a flag
waved in front of me to get me to charge.

217
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,051
I don't think I like your comparison
of the flag of France to a bullfighter's cape.

218
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,137
I meant nothing disrespectful
to the flag of France, sir.

219
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,333
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,

220
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,348
but show me a patriot, and
I'll show you an honest man.

221
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,100
Not everyone has always thought so.

222
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,644
Samuel Johnson had something else
to say about patriotism.

223
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,647
And what was that, may I ask?

224
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,900
- Nothing really.
- What you do mean, "Nothing really"?

225
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,735
Well, sir, nothing really important.

226
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,820
Colonel, when I ask a question,
it's always important.

227
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,031
- Now, who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

228
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,742
All right. Now, what did he
have to say about patriotism?

229
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,161
He said it was the last refuge
of a scoundrel, sir.

230
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,246
I'm sorry. I meant nothing personal.

231
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,501
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

232
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,961
It's you who are exhausted, not your men.

233
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,381
And it's my fault. I've given you
one impossible task after another.

234
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,510
- You need rest. You need it badly.
- I haven't said anything about needing rest, sir.

235
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,554
And you never would either. Therefore, you're
not going to have any say-so about it, Colonel.

236
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,140
As from right now,
I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

237
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,876
General, you can't take
me away from my men.

238
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:12,976
You can't do that to me, sir.

239
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,688
Not to you, Dax. For you.
For your good and for the good of your men.

240
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,732
The good of my men, sir?

241
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,361
If a commanding officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

242
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,657
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you,
but I must have your enthusiastic support.

243
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,952
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Anthill.

244
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,623
We'll take the Anthill.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,378
If any soldiers in the world can take it...

246
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,713
we'll take the Anthill.

247
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,300
And when you do, your men will
be relieved and get a long rest.

248
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,277
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune
reporting, sir.

249
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,573
- You took your time about it.
- We prepared as quick as we could, sir.

250
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,575
We had to alert the sentries.

251
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,577
All right. You men, at ease.

252
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,289
This is a reconnaissance patrol.
German wire, machine gun posts...

253
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,332
identification of bodies.

254
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,627
There will only be the three of us,
and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

255
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,255
[Clears Throat]

256
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,009
We go out to the left, and we come back
through Post 6 on the right.

257
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,803
- Is everything all clear at Post 6?
- All the sentries have been warned up to here.

258
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,307
Number 6 will send up flares
at 10-minute intervals starting at 0400.

259
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,184
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that, sir.

260
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,145
The sergeant says every
five minutes is too much.

261
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,646
He says it's certain to draw artillery.

262
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,773
Quite a strategist, this sergeant.
What's his name?

263
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,192
I don't know, sir.

264
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,573
All right. You men wait outside.
I'll join you in a minute.

265
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,617
Would you mind telling us
the password, sir?

266
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,702
- Calais.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,505
- He's fortifying himself.
- It smelled like heaven.

268
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,717
I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

269
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,887
Well, at least he could have
passed it around, the pig.

270
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,765
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

271
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,517
We went to school together
before the war.

272
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,312
He thinks I don't have enough
respect for him. He's right.

273
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,816
If you gentlemen are ready.

274
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,199
- Colonel.
- Everything clear and understood?

275
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,950
Yes, sir.

276
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,244
The lane through our wire
is right out in front here.

277
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,705
Machine guns are pointing
at the opening.

278
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,707
- Good luck, men.
- Thank you, sir.

279
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,751
All right, men. Let's go.

280
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,036
- What's that?
- [Paris] I don't know.

281
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,665
Lejeune, move out and look that over.
We'll cover you.

282
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,794
Split up a night patrol?

283
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,879
Move out, Lejeune.

284

[Flares Explode]

[Machine Gun Fire]

286
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,009
- I don't like this. Let's get out of here.
- We haven't given him enough time.

287
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,685
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too.
- We've got to wait for him.

288
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,192
[Gasping]
He must be dead. Where is he?

289

290
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,991

[Clatter]

292
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,629
- Well.
- Surprised, Lieutenant?

293
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,174
Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

294
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,344
You didn't wait around to find out,
did you, Lieutenant?

295
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,346
Now, look here. What do you mean?

296
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,224
I mean, you ran like a rabbit
after you killed Lejeune.

297
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,769
Killed Lejeune?
What are you talking about?

298
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,313
I don't think I like your tone.

299
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,691
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

300
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,152
[Chuckling]
Oh, well, I must be mistaken then, sir.

301
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,655
An officer wouldn't do that.

302
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,241
A man wouldn't do it.

303
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,368
Only a thing would.

304
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,955
- A sneaky, booze-guzzling, yellow-bellied rat.
- Now.

305
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,250
with a bottle for a brain and a streak of spit
where his spine ought to be.

306
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,294
- That's enough, Corporal!
- You've got yourself into a mess, Lieutenant.

307
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,589
Oh, I have, have I?
Well, you've got yourself in a worse one.

308
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:26,428
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

309
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,682
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

310
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,393
Now, how do you think those charges
are gonna look on paper?

311
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,729
Not half as bad as these.

312
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,773

Wanton murder of one of your own men...

315

and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

316
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:52,537
Philippe, have you ever tried to bring
charges against an officer?

317
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,331
It's my word against yours, you know.

318
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,542
And whose word do you think
they're gonna believe?

319
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,627
Or l-let me put it another way.

320
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,589
Whose word do you think
they're going to accept?

321
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,175
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

322
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,219
So far, all I have written in this report...

00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,639
is that you and Lejeune
were killed while out on patrol.

324
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,933
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way back...

325
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,894
after becoming separated
during the skirmish.

326
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,230
- That'll end the matter once and for all.
- You killed Lejeune. You know that, don't you?

327
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,733
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- You threw that grenade and killed him.

328
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,903
I'd give anything in the world if it hadn't
have happened, and that's the truth.

329
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,656
Honestly, I know you don't like me,
but what kind of a man do you think I am?

330
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,244
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

331
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,330
I've been waiting for your report,
Lieutenant.

332
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,499
Well, I think we found out
a thing or two.

333
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,086
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

334
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,421
- How'd it happen?
- It's all right here in the report, sir.

335
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,591
- Well, let's have it.
- Oh, it isn't quite finished yet, sir.

336
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,927
That's all, Corporal.
You did a good night's work.

337
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,472
Should feel very proud of yourself.
Go get some sleep.

338
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
Yes, sir.

339
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,314
- How'd you lose Lejeune?
- Machine gun fire, sir.

340
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,067
He coughed.
Almost got us all killed.

341
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,737
Finish that report
and get it to my dugout immediately.

342
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,739
Yes, sir.

343
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,872
The artillery starts at 0515.

344
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,085
First Battalion will move out at 0530.

345
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,420
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wires...

346
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,215
the second wave, consisting of
the Second and Third Battalions.

347
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,969
minus two companies in reserve.
will move out...

348
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,471
in no case later than 0540.

349
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:37,642
Well, that's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

350
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,021
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery preparation
all that we can expect?

351
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:46,609
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organized.

352
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,903
What's weather supposed to be like
tomorrow, sir?

353
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,031
Too good.

354
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,867
No chance of rain or fog?

355
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,579
The forecast is for sun all day.

356
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:02,083
[Officer] lf, uh. Perhaps I should say
when we take the Anthill...

357
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,086
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

358
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:09,549
Well, General Mireau, who, by the way,
will be personally observing the attack...

359
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,594
has promised us support from the 72nd
by sundown tomorrow...

360
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,181
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

361
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,309
Are there any more questions?

362
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:27,025
Well, gentlemen, good luck, and I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

363
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,068
Let's get some sleep.

364
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,073
[Man Whispering] I'm not afraid
of dying tomorrow, only of getting killed.

365
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,825
That's as clear as mud.

366
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,953
Which would you rather be done in by,
a bayonet or a machine gun?

367
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,664
- Oh, a machine gun, naturally.
- Naturally. That’s just my point.

368
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,875
They're both pieces of steel
ripping into your guts.

369
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,794
Only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

370
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,213
What does that prove?

371
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,424
That proves that most of us are more afraid
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

372
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,176
Look at Bernard.

373
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,304
He panics when it comes to gas,
but gas doesn't bother me a bit.

374
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,724
He's seen photos of gas cases.
Doesn't mean anything to me.

375
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,228
But I'll tell you something though. I'd hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat.

376
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,189
But on the other hand, I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

377
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,233
- Why's that?
- You ought to. That's where your brains are.

378
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,194
Because I know a wound to the head
will hurt much more than one in the tail.

379
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,988
The tail is just meat,
but the head. ah, the head is all bone.

380
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,449
- Ah, speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

381
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,035
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

382
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,329
- High explosives.
- Exactly! And it's the same with me.

383
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,415
Because. Because I know that it can
chew you up worse than anything else.

384
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,459
Look, it’s just like I'm trying to tell you.

385
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,045
If you're really afraid of dying, you'd be
living in a funk all the rest of your life...

386
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,506
because you know you've got
to go someday, any day.

387
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,008
And besides, if it's death
that you're really afraid of...

388
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,302
why should you care about
what it is that kills you?

389
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:40,682
Ah, you're too smart for me, Professor.
All I know is nobody wants to die.

390

- Thank you, sir.

00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,876

those are our own positions.

Yes, sir. There is no mistake.

he cannot execute such an order...

to order me to shoot down my own men...

are you going to obey my order?

00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,225
I must have a written order
before I can execute such a command, sir.

Supposing you're killed.
Then where will I be?

tomorrow morning! That's where you'll be!

were very unfair, sir.

- Yes, sir.
- Major Couderc, assemble a general court-martial.

at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

Your troops refused to attack.

480
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,506
Our troops did attack, sir,
but they could make no headway.

481
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,050
Because they didn't try, Colonel.
I saw it myself.

482
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,135
Half of your men never left the trenches.

483
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,097
A third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

484
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,432
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

485
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,562
The fact remains that a good part of your men
never left their own trenches.

486
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,482
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men
from each company in your regiment...

487
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,527
tried under penalty of death for cowardice.

488
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,946
- Penalty of death?
- For cowardice!

489
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,240
They have skimmed milk in their veins
instead of blood.

490
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,697
Then it's the reddest
milk I've ever seen.

491
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:44,326
My trenches are soaked
with that red skimmed milk.

492
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,454
- That’s just about enough out of you, Colonel!
- I'm not gonna mince words and stand on protocol.

493
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,416
Colonel Dax, if you continue in this manner,
I shall have to place you under arrest.

494
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,502
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it rather bluntly.

495
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:56,463
This is not a trial,
but it does bear certain aspects of one.

496
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,925
And Colonel Dax, technically,
is cast in the role of the defense.

497
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,760
In view of the gravity of the charges...

498
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,680
a court of law would grant him
all possible latitude in presenting his case.

499
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,058
Latitude is one thing.
Insubordination another.

500
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,354
I am merely offering an opinion, General.
Please do not feel constrained to accept it.

501
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,275
I am perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

502
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,904
I'm sorry, sir.
I certainly didn't intend to be insubordinate.

503
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,115
My only aim is to remind you
of the heroism these men have shown...

504
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,242
on every occasion in the past.

505
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,245
We're not talking about the past.
We're talking about the present.

506
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,414
But don't you see, sir?
They're not cowards.

507
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,043
So if some of them didn't leave the trenches,
it must have been because it was impossible.

508
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:38,339
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

509
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,634
We can't leave it up to the men
to decide when an order is possible or not.

510
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,595
If it was impossible,
the only proof of that...

511
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,182
would be their dead bodies
lying at the bottom of the trenches.

512
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,434
They're scum, Colonel.

513
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,478
The whole rotten regiment.

514
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,230
a pack of sneaking, whining,
tail-dragging curs.

515
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:59,985
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

516
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,947
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

517
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,491
- Then why not shoot the entire regiment?
- [Laughing]

518
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,953
- I'm perfectly serious.
- Now, Colonel, you're missing the point entirely.

519
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,665
We don't want to slaughter the French army.
All we want to do is to set an example.

520
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,209
Oh, well, if it's an example you want,
then take me.

521
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,711
- Take you?
- Yes, sir, if it's an example you want...

522
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,713
one man will do as well as a hundred.

523
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:24,051
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

524
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,179
[Broulard] Come now, Colonel.
I think you’re overwrought.

525
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,890
This is not a question of officers.

526
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,060
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

527
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,770
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

528
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,941
[Exhales] I was talking of a hundred men,
and now we're down to 12.

529
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,402
Paul, let's not haggle over this thing anymore!

530
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,571
Let's get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it.

531
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:51,578
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see proper justice meted out.

532
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,872
I've spent my entire life in the army.

533
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,291
I've always tried to be true to my principles.

534
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:00,170
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

535
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,423
I'll settle for this.

536
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,176
have the company commanders select one man
from each company in the first wave...

537
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,178
three in all.

538
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,222
Well, that's very reasonable of you, Paul.

539
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,642
The court-martial will meet
at the château at 3:00 this afternoon.

540
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,812
- Will that be convenient for you, General?
- I won't be there, Paul.

541
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,272
You won't be there?

542
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,774
No, I think it best
that you handle this matter on your own.

543
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,528
- Probably so.
- General Mireau.

544
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,657
If it's at all possible, I'd like
to be appointed counsel for the accused.

545
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,701
I'll take the matter into consideration.

546
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,786
I think we can permit that, can't we, Paul?
Of course we can.

547
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,580
- Consider it settled, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

548
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,751
Well, noon straight up, Paul.

549
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,753
I hope that you can stay
for lunch, Colonel.

550
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,255
George, I'm afraid the colonel
won't have time.

551
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,884
Don't deny it, Paul. You've been hiding
this man, keeping him for your own.

552
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,886
I think that was very selfish of you.

553
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,513
Thank you for your courtesy, General,

554
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,015
but I'm afraid there isn't
much time between now and 3:00.

555
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,560
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

556
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,645
[Clicks Heels]

557
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,792
- Yes, Captain? What is it?
- You ordered me to report to you here, sir.

558
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,878
- Captain Rousseau, battery commander, sir.
- Yes, yes, of course.

559
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,757
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

560
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,009
I haven't time to go into it now.

561
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,261
Report back to your command
until further orders.

562
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,263
- Yes, sir.
- [Heels Click]

563
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,227
- Bad stuff. Demoralizes the men.
- I quite agree with you.

564
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,021
And the best solution
is to shelve him to another outfit.

565
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,315
A court of inquiry
ought to roast him a bit first.

566
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,943
Well, in cases like this.
shells falling short.

567
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,028
I. I always try to avoid an inquiry.

568
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,323
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

569
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,909
No, shelving will be the best discipline
for him, in my opinion.

570
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,954
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Oh, uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

571
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,164
A regimental matter
I want to mention to the colonel.

572
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,750
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

573
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,796
That will be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

574
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,302
Yes, sir.

575
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:08,799
Have them meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

576
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,801
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel Dax.

577
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,596
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a word with you.

578
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,890
Certainly, sir.

579
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,643
Let's be sensible about this.

580
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,979
Sensible, sir?

581
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,814
Listen to me, Dax.

582
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,650
Drop this fancy talk with me, understand?

583
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,571
General Broulard seems to think
you're funny. I don't.

584
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,867
- Now, I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir. Is that an order?

585
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,579
Colonel Dax, when this mess is cleaned up,
I'll break you.

586
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,166
I'll find an excuse and I'll break you
to the ranks. I'll ruin you.

587
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,168
And it'll be just what you deserve...

588
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,171
showing such little loyalty
to your commanding officer.

589
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,256
That's all, Colonel.

590
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,279
[Officer]
Detail, halt!

591
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,908
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Anthill yesterday morning failed...

592
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,203
because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the First Battalion.

593
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,580
Each of you is to select
one man from your company...

594
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,709
place him under arrest and have him ready
to appear before a general court-martial...

595
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,212
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

596
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,631
The charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

597
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,800
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

598
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,240
But Lieutenant Roget
killed Lejeune on that patrol...

599
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,575
and then blackmailed me
into keeping quiet about the whole thing!

600
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,161
- That's why he picked me.
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

601
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,039
But that story has nothing to do
with the charges you're being tried for.

602
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,168
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do, but who else will?

603
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,587
You've got no witnesses.

604
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,591
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonize the court.

605
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,136
When we get clear of this,
I'm going into the story of that patrol again.

606
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,015
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart
had the sergeant draw lots.

607
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,559
I was picked purely by chance.

608
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,937
You're lucky. Look at me.

609
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:31,441
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

610
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,860
Me, a social undesirable, Colonel.

611
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,157
- I didn't act like a coward.
Picking by lots. is that fair?

612
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:37,281
Neither did I! Major Vignon.

613
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,492
Gentlemen! You've all got to understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial.

614
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,246
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

615
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,127
Stick to the stories you've told me...

616
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,421
and don't let the prosecutor
shake you out of them.

617
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,800
Now remember, you'll be soldiers
in the presence of superior officers.

618
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,679
So act like what you are. soldiers.

619
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,140
And brave ones at that.

620
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,225
Now, I've been in the room
you'll be sitting in.

621
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,311
The afternoon sun will be in your faces...

622
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:11,189
so don't let it seem as if you’re
dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

623
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,776
When you answer questions,
look the judges in the eye.

624
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,821
Don't whine, plead or make speeches.
That's my job.

625
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,823
Simple statements. short...

626
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,950
but make them so they can be heard
all over the room.

627
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,577
And try not to repeat yourselves.

628
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,662
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

629
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,205
Now, we haven't much time.

630
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,334
The court-martial begins in about an hour,
and I've got notes to look at.

631
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,671
Good luck.

632
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,715
- Thank you, sir.
- Colonel, sir.

633
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,767
On the left, ho!

634
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,689
Detail, halt!

635
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:56,026
Prisoners, right heel!

636
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,570
On the left, ho!

637
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,079
On the left, ho!

638
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,626
Left face!

639
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,300
The court-martial is open.
The prisoners may be seated.

640
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,642
[Coughs]
This is a general court-martial.

641
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,604
We shall therefore dispense
with unnecessary formalities.

642
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:36,274
These men are charged
with cowardice in the face of the enemy...

643
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,360
and will be tried for that offense.

644
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:43,448
- Mr. Prosecutor.
- Call the accused. Private Ferol.

645
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,450
Mr. President.

646
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,413
Will the prosecutor question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment?

647
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:53,083
Please don't take up the court's time
with technicalities.

648
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,294
The indictment is lengthy,
and there's no point in reading it.

649
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,214
The defense has a right to know
the exact accusations.

650
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,259
The indictment is that the accused showed
cowardice in the face of the enemy...

651
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,511
during the attack on the Anthill.

652
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,556
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

653
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,392
Call the accused. Private Ferol.

654
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,280
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir?

655
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,866
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Anthill?

656
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,659
Yes, sir.

657
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,705
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No, sir.

658
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,749
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

659
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,751
How far did you advance?

660
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:40,130
To about the middle
of no-man's-land, sir.

661
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,424
Then what did you do?

662
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,426
There were machine-gun bullets
landing all around.

663
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,887
Answer the question.
What did you do?

664
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:51,349
Well, I saw that me and Meyer, sir.

665
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,560
I didn't ask you what you saw.

666
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,564
The court has no concern
with your... visual experiences.

667
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,109
- My what, sir?
- Prisoner will reply to the question.

668
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:03,111
Yes, sir. What question was it?

669
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:06,823
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

670
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,659
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

671
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,411
I went back, sir.

672
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:16,374
In other words, Private Ferol,
you retreated.

673
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,960
Yes, sir.

674
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,714
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

675
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,008
Just a minute.

676
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,720
Mr. President, I'd like
to question the witness if I may.

677
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,224
- Proceed, Colonel.
- Thank you.

678
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,393
Now, Private Ferol, when you reached
the middle of no-man's-land...

679
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,647
- were you alone with Private Meyer?
- Yes, sir.

680
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,941
Well, what happened to the rest
of your company?

681
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,360
Well, I don't know, sir.

682
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,445
I guess the rest of them
had been killed or wounded.

683
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,533
And you found yourself in the middle
of no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

684
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,951
Yes, sir.

685
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,786
Why didn't you attack the Anthill
single-handed?

686
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,957
[Exhales]

687
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,876
Why didn't you storm the Anthill alone?

688
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,588
Just me and Meyer?
You're kidding, sir.

689
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,715
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.

690
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,509
Thank you. That's all.

691
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,303
I don't see the point
of this line of questioning.

692
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,597
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir...

693
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:16,768
the utter absurdity of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

694
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,853
Mr. Prosecutor.

695
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:23,358
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated.

696
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,236
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

697
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,156
I knew we should've took Anthill,
but we came on back.

698
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,744
[Dax]
That's all.

699
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,331
The accused may return to his seat.

700
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,596
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

701
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,434
Yes, sir, until I was ordered
back to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

702
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,603
How far did you advance?

703
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,605
Into the wire, sir.

704
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,400
The, uh, enemy wire, I suppose.

705
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,485
No, sir. It was our wire.

706
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:14,200
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

707
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,244
No, sir, I didn't.

708
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:20,999
How far would you say that was?
How many meters?

709
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,710
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

710
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,962
How many meters?

711
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,214
Not many.

712
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,344
"Not many."

713
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:40,310
Now, Private Arnaud,
before you were ordered back...

714
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,729
did you urge your fellow soldiers forward?

715
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,651
Most of them were dead or wounded before
they got three steps beyond the trenches.

716
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,194
Reply to the question.

717
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,863
I didn't urge them on. No, sir.

718
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,452
Thank you.

719
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,919
Private Arnaud.

720
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,004
At ease, please.

721
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:13,259
Aside from your sad failure to give throat
to spirited battle cries...

722
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,471
was your behavior different in any respect
from that of the other men in your company?

723
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,349
Objection. That's a matter of conjecture.

724
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,643
Sustained.

725
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,524
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

726
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,983
No, sir.

727
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,486
Is it true that you've been
designated a coward...

728
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,406
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

729
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,367
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

730
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,246
It's accepted practice in the French army
to pick examples by lot.

731
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,873
And since this entire company
advanced only a few meters...

732
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,876
picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

733
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,713
Well, I'd like to point out that this soldier
has distinguished himself...

734
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,340
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war.

735
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,135
With the court's permission...

736
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,722
I'll read citations for bravery
that he's already earned on two occasions.

737
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,435
First, citations in the Orders in the Army
for bravery.

738
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,019
That's immaterial, Colonel.

739
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,063
The accused is not being tried
for his former bravery...

740
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,149
but for his recent cowardice.

741
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,317
Medals are no defense.

742
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,448
May I call witnesses to his character?

743
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,283
You may not.

744
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,995
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

745
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,750
Mr. President,
no one in the entire regiment...

746
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,919
got anywhere near the German wire,
including myself.

747
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,839
Call the next accused...

748
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,133
if you’re through, Colonel.

749
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,802
Thank you.

750
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,846
Prisoner may return to his seat.

751
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:52,108
[Prosecutor]
So you never even left the trenches.

752
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,528
- No, sir.
- That's all.

753
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:00,742
Corporal Paris,
why didn't you leave the trenches?

754
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:06,122
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

755
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,959
And were you lying unconscious
in the trenches during the entire attack?

756
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,795
Yes, sir.

757
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,380
That's all.

758
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,424
Have you any witnesses to that?

759
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,512
No, sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me.

760
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,472
And there were so many others
lying dead anyway.

761
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,642
- But you have no witnesses.
- No, sir.

762
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:29,479
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

763
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,773
That could have been self-inflicted later.

764
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,611
- Thank you. You may stand down.
- [Clicks Heels]

765
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,410
Mr. Prosecutor,
you can make your plea now.

766
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,584
Gentlemen of the court...

767
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,797
this case speaks for itself.

768
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,342
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

769
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,306
And I submit that that attack...

770
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,186
was a stain on the flag of France...

771
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,689
a blot on the honor...

772
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,942
of every man, woman and child
in the French nation.

773
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,867
It is to us that the sad, distressing...

774
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,620
repellant duty falls, gentlemen.

775
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:33,960
I ask this court
to find the accused guilty...

776
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,593
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the Code of Military Justice.

777
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,390
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

778
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,019
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

779
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,573
Gentlemen of the court,
there are times when I'm ashamed...

780
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,283
to be a member of the human race...

781
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,619
and this is one such occasion.

782
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:13,499
It's impossible for me to summarize
the case for the defense...

783
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:17,462
since the court never allowed me
a reasonable opportunity to present my case.

784
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,465
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

785
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,261
Yes, sir.

786
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,097
I protest against being prevented
from introducing evidence...

787
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,726
that I consider vital to the defense.

788
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,603
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

789
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,983
There has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants.

790
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:41,778
And lastly, I protest against the fact...

791
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,031
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

792
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:59,337
The attack yesterday morning
was no stain on the honor of France...

793
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,384
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

794
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:09,681
But this court-martial is such a stain
and such a disgrace.

795
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:13,726
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

796
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,479
Gentlemen of the court...

797
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,232
to find these men guilty...

798
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,486
would be a crime
to haunt each of you...

799
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,571
till the day you die.

800
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:34,038
I can't believe
that the noblest impulse of man.

801
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,125
his compassion for another
can be completely dead here.

802
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,587
Therefore, I humbly beg you...

803
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,967
show mercy to these men.

804
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,393
The accused will be escorted
back to the guardroom.

805
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,395
The hearing is closed.

806
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,981
The court will now retire to deliberate.

807
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,983
There will be a guard of six men under arms.

808
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,570
rifles loaded, bayonets fixed.
two men to each prisoner.

809
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,031
Any sign of trouble,
the prisoners will be instantly covered.

810
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:12,035
And if the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

811
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,455
Everything must go off without a hitch
with the least possible delay...

812
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,457
but it shouldn't be hurried.

There must be no fumbling around.

pass on any blame. and with interest.

Execution will take place at 7:00
according to the verdict of the court-martial.

819
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,109
Detail, attention! Dismissed!

820
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,125
This is compliments of General Mireau.

821
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,336
- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks.

822
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,421
Oh, don't blame me, soldier.

823
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,549
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed
to eat this with. our fingers?

824
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:12,428
The guard says you can't have
any knives or forks.

825

[Paris] Is this supposed to be
our last meal or something?

826
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,392
It isn't "supposed to be" our last meal.
It is our last meal.

Hey, this duck is terrific.

828
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,481
You suppose they put anything in the food?

829
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,566
First they poison us, then they shoot us?

830
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,822
[Spits]
I think they put something in it.

831
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,824
Like what?

832
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:37,036
Like, uh. Like something
or make us groggy or something.

833
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,205
What would be wrong with that
if they did?

834
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,917
Maybe nothing for you,
but I'm gonna get out of this somehow...

835
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,418

gonna kill us in a few hours if we don't.

840

- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's gotta be a way.

841
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,313
How many guards
you think they've got out there?

842
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:07,358
They may have a couple of squads.
That's what it sounded like this morning.

843
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,945
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the Third Battalion.

844
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:14,365
Anyway, right now, we have no friends.

845
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,326
Why kid yourself?
We're not gonna get out of this.

846

Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead
and it'll be alive.

849
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,840
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

850

Good evening, my sons.
I'm Father Dupree.

853
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,484
Is there any news?

854
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:53,446
Yes. I'm afraid I bring you
very bad news.

855
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,407
You must prepare yourselves for the worst.
Colonel Dax asked me to tell you so.

but unable to speak to General Broulard
or, for that matter, to anyone in authority.

859

Same way at Division. No one wants to be found.

860
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,630
- How much time do we have?
- You have plenty of time yet.

861
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,132
Certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves.

867
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,235
Father, will you take
this letter for me, please?

868
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,362
- Of course, my son.
- It's to my wife.

869
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,323
She won't understand this,
and I tried to explain it to her.

870
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,450
I'll see that she gets it.

871
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,411
Do you want me to hear your confession?

872
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,665
Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

873
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,627
I know you're trying to help,
and I appreciate it...

874
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,463
but if I started praying now,
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

875
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,632
Oh, that's an error, my son.

876
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,176
God is always ready
to listen to your prayers.

877
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,306
All right, Father.

878
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,850
- Will you please hear my confession now?
- Yes.

Have faith in your Creator, my son.

and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

That's really deep.
"Death comes to us all."

883
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,073
That really is deep.

Thank you. Amen.

I understand your anguish, my son...

but you must not let it
harden your heart.

890
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,590
May I tell you something, Father?

891
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,843
Back in my hometown,
there was a certain little café...

892
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,304
with an amusing sign over the bar.

893
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,557
It read, "Do not be afraid
to ask for credit...

894

- Oh, Paris, leave me alone.

Come on. Come on, sit down.

And you, get out of here
with your sanctimonious pat answers.

What are you hanging around for.
to torture us?

899
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,654
- No. To help you with all my power.
- Your power? You have no power!

- No, but God has power.

- Does he? What a laugh!
- You can be saved.

That should keep him quiet long enough.

908
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,693
That's a nasty skull fracture though.
He may not live out the night.

909
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,695
What are we supposed
to do with him?

910
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,449
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so that he won't slip when you tilt it vertically.

911
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,452
Surely they won't execute a man
in that condition.

912
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,454
I'm sorry, Father.
The sentence will be carried out.

913
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,956
I've already checked
with the general on it.

914
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,958
If he's still alive in the morning...

915

pinch his cheeks a couple of times
before you take him out on the field.

916
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,172
It may make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

- [Dax] Yes?

- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in, come in.

919
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,851
Sergeant Boulanger said
that you wanted to see me, sir.

920
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,645
Yes, Lieutenant.

921
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,232
Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant thing
on our hands in a few hours, doesn't it?

922
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,068
- You mean the execution, sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

923
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,237
Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.

924
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,532
Oh, very unfortunate.
That’s just how I feel about it.

927
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,791
- Well, I. I had to pick somebody, sir.
- That's right. You did.

928
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,419
Of course, you had no personal motive
in picking Paris, did you?

929
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,671
Oh, no, sir.

930
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,965
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't you?

931
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,512
- Well, did you or didn't you?
- Oh, yes, sir, I did.

[Exhales]
Well.

933
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,059
Like you say,
somebody had to be picked.

934
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,771
- Oh, it was quite a problem, sir.
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

of the firing squad tomorrow.

to taking the job?

- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

938
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,951
- Well.
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

939

Well, no. Yeah, l-I feel all right, sir.

- It’s just that I.
- Is it too hot in here?

941
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,208
- Would you like me to open a window?
- No, sir. No, sir.

942
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:21,547
Well, it's. It’s just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

943
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,758
Oh, there's nothing to it.

944
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,178
First, you help the sergeant
tie the men to the posts.

945
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,221
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds.

946
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,308
And, well, if they want them,
you tie them on, see?

947
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,477
Now, you.you take your position
with the firing squad...

948
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,813
you raise your sword.
"Ready, aim, fire."

949
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:41,942
Then you draw your revolver out,
you walk forward...

through each man's head.

951

from this duty.

Well, thank you, sir, but I must confess
that, uh, this is not entirely a social visit.

974
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:47,276
Oh, come, Dax, let's not
go over all that ground again.

975
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,780
Though, uh, I must admit that,
judging from the casualties...

976
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,949
the efforts of your regiment
must have been considerable.

977
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:57,411
Now, how can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

978
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,456
Oh, come, Colonel. You're choosing
to take a rather simple view of this thing.

979
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,543
The attack was impossible from the start.
The General Staff must have known that.

980
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,382
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

981
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,384
You must be aware of the fact
that the General Staff...

982
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,555
is subject to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

983
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,266
Maybe the attack against the Anthill
was impossible.

984
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,769
Perhaps it was an error of judgment
on our part.

985
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,023
On the other hand, if your men had been
a little more daring, they might have taken it.

986
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,609
Who knows? In any case...

987
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,321
why should we have to bear any more
criticism for failure than we have to.

988
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,991
Aside from the inescapable fact that a good
many of your men never left the trenches...

989
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,619
there's the question of the troops' morale.
Don't forget that.

990
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,579
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

991
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,666
These executions will be a perfect tonic
for the entire division.

992
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,168
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating...

993
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,212
than seeing someone else die.

994
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,173
- I never thought of that, sir.
- You see, Colonel, troops are like children.

995
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,677
Just as a child wants his father to be firm,
troops crave discipline.

996
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,220
I see.

997
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,847
And one way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

998
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,351
May I ask...

999
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,437
do you sincerely believe
all the things you’ve just said?

1000
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,403
It's been a pleasure
discussing this with you, Colonel...

1001
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,864
but I'm afraid that I'd better
be getting back to my guests.

1002
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,325
Forgive me for having kept you
from your party.

1003
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,540
Oh, by the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau...

1004
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:28,043
ordered his own battery commander,
Captain Rousseau...

1005
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,838
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

1006
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,423
# [Waltz Continues]

1007
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:38,053
Well, of course the captain refused
without a written order...

1008
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:42,391
but General Mireau demanded that he
commence firing on our own trenches.

1009
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,977
Again Rousseau refused
without an order in writing...

1010
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:49,189
but again he was ordered,
and again he refused.

1011
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,191
all in front of witnesses.

1012
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,069
Do you actually believe
this fantastic story?

1013
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:58,240
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

1014
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,910
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter...

1015
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,748
the telephone clerk and, uh,
my own deposition.

1016
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:10,002
What has all this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners?

1017
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,756
A general in a tantrum over the failure
of an impossible attack...

1018
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,341
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

1019
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,429
Now, this same officer on the same day...

1020
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,849
orders a court-martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

1021
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:30,564
General, what would your, uh, newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

1022
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,109
Colonel Dax, are you trying
to blackmail me?

1023
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:38,322
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

1024
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,324
Too much has happened.
Someone's got to be hurt.

1025
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,409
The only question is who.

1026
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:47,706
General Mireau's assault
on the Anthill failed...

1027
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,627
and his order to fire on this own troops
was refused.

1028
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,962
But his attempt to murder
three innocent men...

1029
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:58,175
to protect his own reputation
will be prevented by the General Staff.

1030

don't you think?

1139
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,575
I have never seen an affair of this sort
handled any better.

1140
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,536
The men died wonderfully.

1141
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,632
There's always that chance that
one of them will do something

1142
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:49,998
that will leave everyone
with a bad taste.

1143
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,833
This time, you couldn't ask for better.

1144
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,169
[Knocking]

1145
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,671
Yes?

1146
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,089
[Broulard]
Yes, Colonel?

1147
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,632
You wanted to see me, sir.

1148
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,927
[Chuckling] Oh, yes, yes.
Come in, Colonel. Come in and sit down.

1149
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,432
Oh, Colonel Dax,
your men died very well.

1150
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:14,022
- Would you like some coffee, Colonel?
- No, thank you, sir.

1151
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,441
Oh, by the way, Paul,
it's been brought to my attention...

1152
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,445
that you ordered your artillery to fire on your
own men during the attack on the Anthill.

1153
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,157
- I did what?
- [Cup Clatters]

1154
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:28,661
- Who told you that?
- Colonel Dax came to me last night with the story.

1155
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:35,210
Colonel Dax, I've always known
that you were a disloyal officer...

1156
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,671
but I never dreamed that you would
stoop to anything so low as this.

1157
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:43,176
General, I have sworn statements
from Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter...

1158
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,179
Captain Rousseau, the battery commander
who refused your order.

1159
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,306
I think it's infamous,
absolutely infamous.

1160
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,683
Then there's no truth at all
to the charge made by Colonel Dax?

1161
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:53,061
I don't see how you could
even ask me that.

1162
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,563
You cannot imagine how glad I am
to hear that, Paul.

1163
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,233
I'm certain that
you'll come through it all right.

1164
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,819
- I'll come through what?
- There will have to be an inquiry.

1165
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:03,071
- An inquiry?
- But it won't amount to much.

1166
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,407
- Those things never do. The public forgets.
- "Public"?

1167
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,325
You've got to have the right
to clear your name.

1168
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,329
You cannot allow such vile insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

1169
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,874
So that's it.

1170
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,086
You're making me the goat.

1171
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,172
the only completely innocent man
in this whole affair.

1172
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:29,097
I have only one last thing
to say to you, George.

1173
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,517
The man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier.

1174
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,693
[Door Slams]

1175
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,362
Well...

1176
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,364
had to be done.

1177
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:49,742
France cannot afford to have fools
guiding her military destiny.

1178
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:52,954
I'm grateful to you, Dax, for having
brought this matter to my attention.

1179
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:56,374
Colonel Dax, how would you like
General Mireau's job?

1180
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,628
- His what, sir?
- His job.

1181
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,339
Let me get this straight, sir.

1182
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:07,218
You're offering me
General Mireau's command?

1183
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,054
Come, come, Colonel Dax.
Don't overdo the surprise.

1184
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,974
You've been after the job from the start.
We all know that, my boy.

1185
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:17,604
I may be many things, sir,
but I'm not your boy.

1186
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:20,482
Well, I certainly didn't mean to imply
any biological relationship.

1187
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,734
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- You trying to provoke me, Colonel?

1188
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,736
- Why should I want to do that, sir?
- Exactly.

1189
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,821
It would be a pity to lose your promotion
before you get it...

1190
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:29,616
a promotion you have
so very carefully planned for.

1191
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:35,997
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

1192
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,876
Colonel Dax! You will apologize at once,
or I shall have you placed under arrest!

1193
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:45,673
I apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

1194
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:48,384
I apologize for not revealing
my true feelings.

1195
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,638
I apologize, sir,
for not telling you sooner...

1196
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:54,807
that you're a degenerate,
sadistic old man...

1197
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,853
and you can go to hell before I apologize
to you now or ever again!

1198
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:04,609
Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me.

1199
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:09,739
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality.

1200
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,866
You really did want to save those men...

1201
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,702
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

1202
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:18,706
You're an idealist, and I pity you
as I would the village idiot.

1203
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,209
We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

1204
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,211
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

1205
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:27,215
You bring charges against General Mireau,
so I insist that he answer them.

1206
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,008
Wherein have I done wrong?

1207
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,265
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

1208
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,019
I pity you.
