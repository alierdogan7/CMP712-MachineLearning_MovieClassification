1
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,800
MAN: Yellow forms, please.

2
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,337
Wait here.

3
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,016
Are your people in the navy?
- No. Yours?

4
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,398
Oh, yes.
My father's captain of the Unity.

5
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,473
What does yours do?
- He's a writer.

6
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,597
John Kipling?

7
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:58,581
Come on, Kipling.
Where the hell are you?

8
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,089
I'm a great admirer of your father's.

9
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,858
Will you tell him
I just polished off Kim?

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,426
Absolutely loved it.

11
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,061
Yes, I will, sir.

12
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,864
You're wearing spectacles.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:15,469
Shall we start with the eyes then,
and work backwards?

14
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,901
Allah's teeth. Where are they?

15
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,976
Ah, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

16
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,321
Thank you.

17
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:53,145
His Majesty is expecting you, sir.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,610
Don't worry, I have it about me.
I shall catch you on the way out.

19
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,279
Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,674
Stand on the cross, please.

21
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,583
Turn around.

22
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,273
And read the letters on the chart,
starting at the top.

23
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,621
H, A, L...

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,900
...without the spectacles.

25
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,952
Two hours, 57 minutes.

26
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,052
Yes.

27
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,280
Oh, at last.

28
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,525
Congratulations.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,693
Marvellous run.

30
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,793
Awful close.
- Whisky?

31
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,131
It's a bit early.
- Oh, bugger the time.

32
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,441
Got to toast your triumph.

33
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,338
I've been tinkering with fourth gear,
it adds a little something.

34
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:02,263
Plus a new stretch of tarmac
near Lamberhurst.

35
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,878
To the shattering
of the three-hour barrier,

36
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,846
on the Bateman's-windsor run.

37
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,261
To the Silver Ghost.
- The Silver Ghost.

38
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,016
How's the family?
- Well, as we speak,

39
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,492
my son will be plum in the middle
of his medical for the navy.

40
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,727
Ah.

41
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,988
Big day.
- Absolutely.

42
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,997
How's your youngest?
- Not good.

43
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,226
Big heart, weak body.

44
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,273
May I read you something?
- Fire away.

45
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,074
This morning's Times.

46
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,410
'Rudyard Kipling,
speaking yesterday at a meeting...

47
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,113
'attended by more than 10,000 people,

48
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:45,919
'painted an alarming picture of life
in this country under German rule.'

49
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,488
You think they'd invade?
- I know they would...

50
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,924
...and our Government will be there
to welcome them ashore.

51
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,234
Soft-centred bloody tribe.

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,031
The Prime Minister has asked
me to beg you, those were his words,

53
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,999
to hold back at this sensitive time.

54
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,100
Why?

55
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,002
He believes there's still a chance
of avoiding war.

56
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,940
He's wrong.
- He thinks your pessimism is premature.

57
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,590
One million German soldiers...

58
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,078
...are sitting on the Belgium border
ready for the off.

59
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,547
It depends how you define premature.
- Quite.

60
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,450
Our heads are buried in the sand, sir.

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,689
We have a tiny professional army,
our weapons are 50 years old.

62
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,958
If we don't get our skates on,
we will pay the price.

63
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,660
But are you prepared to ease up a bit?
At least in public?

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Certainly not.

65
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,996
Glad to hear it. More whisky?

66
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,574
Kodaks.

67
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,712
This is private property.
You are trespassing, please leave now.

68
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,946
Mrs Kipling...
- Now, please.

69
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,281
And take your Kodaks with you.

70
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,351
Is Mr Kipling available?
- No, he is not available.

71
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,919
You British journalists
are unbelievable.

72
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,521
You treat my husband like a zoo animal.

73
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,958
Now if you really admire him so much,
you would respect his privacy.

74
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,193
How would you like it...

75
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,130
...if I came tramping over
your garden uninvited?

76
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,300
Sir, you have a very distinctive face,

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,603
and I would be happy to describe it
to the police.

78
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,703
Leave, please.

79
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,212
The injured soldier.

80
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,718
Thank you for this, sir.
- What an ever so impressive sight.

81
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,654
How far did you fall?

82
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,417
Fifteen feet.
- Allah be praised.

83
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,524
Fifteen feet is high.

84
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,554
Did it hurt a great deal?
- No.

85
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,872
That was a stroke of luck.

86
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,502
Now your father tells me
you've read the first Jungle Book.

87
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,264
Yes.
- But not the second.

88
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,073
No.

89
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,173
Here you are, Arthur.

90
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:50,877
Is Mowgli in it?

91
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,377
Every page is chock-a-block with Mowgli.

92
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,518
And I've written your name and my name
in the front,

93
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,553
so we don't forget who we are.

94
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,757
And I've done a very silly picture
of you plunging from your apple tree.

95
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:09,228
But that's in pencil, so you can
rub it out as soon as I've gone.

96
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,328
Thank you.

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,168
Kodaks in the garden again.

98
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,903
Did you see them off?
- Oh, yes.

99
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,907
Oh, that's good.

100
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,942
Derry and Toms
are selling women's underwear...

101
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,144
...in the suffragette colours.

102
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,814
Purple and green stripes.
- Don't you dare.

103
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,420
There you go, Josie.
- I never imagine her ageing.

104
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,770
She's always seven,
but she's always older than me.

105
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,258
Funny.

106
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,724
She'd be 22 now.
- And 32 days exactly.

107
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,036
Do you know
what my mother used to call her?

108
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,604
The Little American.

109
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,005
Really?
- Mmm.

110
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,008
She spoke with an American accent
until the day she died.

111
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,344
Much to my mother's delight.

112
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,444
RUDYARD: Jack.

113
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,713
Jack.

114
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,817
Jack.

115
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:19,026
Where's the Admiral?
- He's fixing the motorcycle with Peter.

116
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,272
Well, how did he get on?

117
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,668
They turned him down.

118
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,942
ELSIE: He wasn't allowed
to wear his specs for the eye test.

119
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:34,103
For God's sake.
Do they want volunteers or not?

120
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,548
It seems sensible to me.

121
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,252
Bird, wearing spectacles
does not make one a bloody invalid.

122
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,955
I didn't say...
- I am not rising to the bait.

123
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,775
God, that is par for the course.

124
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,363
Are you going down to see John, sir?
- I am.

125
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,732
Could you tell Peter
we'll be going home in 10 minutes?

126
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,832
I will, indeed.

127
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,015
Peter, your mother wants you
ready for the off in ten minutes.

128
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,115
Really?
- Really.

129
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,071
Don't be downhearted, old man.

130
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,090
I'm not.
- Good.

131
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,663
The navy has always been tough
on that sort of issue.

132
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,198
We'll attack on another front.

133
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,233
What's the point of specs
if you can't use them?

134
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,598
I know, it makes me spit blood.

135
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,508
These people have no imagination.

136
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,942
But we must buck up and look forwards.

137
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,217
Did they realise who you were?
- One of them did.

138
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,317
Right.

139
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,022
Look, the army would be
a completely different kettle of fish.

140
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:54,660
I wanted to join the navy.
- I know, but onwards, old man.

141
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,866
What if I organise a private examination
with the Army Medical Board,

142
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,434
just as a preliminary canter?

143
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,171
We could go together.
- Lf I go, I can go on my own.

144
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,075
Of course you can,
but a bit of support might be useful.

145
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,320
Be worth it if it tipped the balance.

146
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,912
Have a think about it.

147
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,418
If you put her through her paces,
let me know.

148
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,408
I'd like to see how she's running.

149
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,490
I shall see you anon.

150
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,694
RUDYARD: If the Hun invades our shores,

151
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,201
our English soul will be squashed...

152
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,959
...and squeezed until it cries out in pain.

153
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,902
The German will bring in his wake...

154
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,176
...riot and starvation and bloodshed.

155
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:55,644
The blood of our mothers and fathers,
our wives,

156
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,884
our sons and our daughters...

157
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,295
...will drench the streets of our cities,

158
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,558
and paint our rivers red.

159
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,875
And after the war is over,

160
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:14,366
when the riots in London and Manchester
and Liverpool are quelled,

161
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:20,502
when our raped women
are huddled and still,

162
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,613
what then?

163
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,065
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have been informed...

164
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:44,350
...that 10 minutes ago,
Great Britain declared war on Germany.

165
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,133
Our army of 160,000...

166
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,914
...must now face a German army
of one and a half million.

167
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,574
We must demand...

168
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:02,518
...that every fit young man
come forward to enlist.

169
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,053
And that... And...

170
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,919
And that every young man
who chooses to remain at home...

171
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,961
...be shunned by his community.

172
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,763
Only our unity,

173
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,632
our strength...

174
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,180
...and our courage
can save us from destruction.

175
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,621
Wonderful speech. Sandhurst here I come.

176
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,594
When do you join the navy, Jack?

177
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,063
Well, I've been thinking
I'd see more action in the army.

178
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,198
You can't change your tune.

179
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,667
I'm not sitting in the Channel...

180
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,592
...while you're all doing your bit
in Belgium.

181
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,841
I can't get to grips with it.
- Well, you must.

182
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,344
A pince-nez gives a man
a different expression...

183
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,545
...as compared to spectacles.

184
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,147
If the army is desperate for recruits,

185
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,215
they won't mind a pair of specs.
It doesn't suit me.

186
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,650
Yes, it does.
- Does it?

187
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
I think...
- It's good.

188
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,688
Now, I wonder...

189
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,525
...if you shouldn't brush your hair
back away from the face.

190
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,761
You've got a high forehead,
it'd be a shame to waste it.

191
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,229
What's a high forehead
got to do with it?

192
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,365
It's a sign of intelligence.
- It can't be.

193
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,101
I'm assured it is.
- No, it's too loose, I'm not wearing it.

194
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,270
CARRIE: Will it really make
a difference to his chances?

195
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,638
It's a medical, not a costume parade.

196
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,074
Jack, I'm sure you're going
to sail into the army,

197
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,076
but your eyes are a serious issue...

198
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,112
...and the overall impression
will be vital.

199
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:38,312
You've got to take a big pull
on yourself and really dig out.

200
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,619
Now...

201
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,725
...see if that's a snugger fit.

202
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,667
Better?
- Probably.

203
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:59,187
Good. Have a stroll round the room,
see how it feels.

204
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,845
I'm not wearing it.

205
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,113
Jack.

206
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,855
You'll do more harm than good.
- He is not a boy, he is a young man.

207
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,757
If you continue to pamper him,

208
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,160
he will turn into something altogether
weak and watery.

209
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,763
Well, if he's a young man, he's
old enough to make his own decisions.

210
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,500
This is absolutely his own decision,
but I want him to make the most of...

211
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,034
You want.

212
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,035
For his sake. It's Jack's future.

213
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,507
Precisely.
- No, I'm not going to argue, Carrie.

214
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,511
Rud, his eyes are not an excuse.
The navy gave him five minutes.

215
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,881
Do you really think it's fair
to encourage him?

216
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,381
I would think it very unfair
if I didn't.

217
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,096
Breathe in.

218
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,100
And out.

219
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,736
This shouldn't take long,
it's all standard stuff.

220
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,571
A quick look at the ears.

221
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,507
I've always wondered, Kipling...
- Other ear.

222
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,309
...how on earth
do you think up the story?

223
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,012
Well, inventing the story
isn't the problem.

224
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,182
It's putting the jigsaw together
afterwards that can be troublesome.

225
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,616
Pants down, please.

226
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,852
Ah, it's the structure
that's a bit tricky, is it?

227
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,755
My son's just polished off
the Jungle Books.

228
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,191
Absolutely loved them. Cough.

229
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,059
I suppose you've read
all your father's books?

230
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,429
I've never read the Jungle Books.
- I don't believe it.

231
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,064
Cough again.

232
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,291
Jolly good. Pants up.

233
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,902
Clean bill of health?
- Yes, fighting fit.

234
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,572
Just the eye test and we can relax.

235
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,108
Spectacles off.
- It's a pince-nez, actually.

236
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,333
From the top, off you go.

237
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,781
I can't see anything, I'm afraid.

238
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,881
Nothing?

239
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,819
Would you walk towards the board...

240
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,339
...and stop when you can clearly read
the top letter?

241
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,954
T, Q, U.

242
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,226
And the next line.

243
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,042
Y, O, w.

244
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,255
This is very serious myopia,
we couldn't possibly...

245
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,957
There are very strict guidelines.
- I think Colonel Brooks would agree,

246
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,525
we were prepared to stretch a point.

247
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,794
BROOKS: Indeed,
but there has to be a limit.

248
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,831
If he lost his spectacles,
he'd be a danger to himself.

249
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,065
And to his men.

250
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,290
I'm very sorry.
- So am I.

251
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,070
You haven't given the boy a chance.

252
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,907
It's precisely the sort of inflexibility...

253
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,542
...this country needs
to get out of its system.

254
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,246
John has so much to offer.
It's a great shame.

255
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,614
I agree. I do agree.

256
00:16:55,714 --> 00:17:00,619
Well, clearly you don't
or we'd be looking for a way forward.

257
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,153
Nothing you can do? Hmm?

258
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,860
Well, I'm not calling it a day,
I shall write.

259
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,425
I think it's utterly gutless.

260
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,987
It's so spineless.

261
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,932
Come on, John. We're off.

262
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,740
My son's commitment is second to none.

263
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,835
He deserves this opportunity
and he will get it.

264
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,458
Jack.

265
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,163
Jack.

266
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,369
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,493
No, you're not,
you're absolutely delighted.

268
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,424
Best beloved brother.

269
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,893
Bird.

270
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,883
They turned me down.
- I guessed.

271
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,167
Can I have a puff?

272
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,973
Don't you hate this room?

273
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,242
There's not one comfortable chair
in the whole bloody building.

274
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,611
It's true.
- I have to get out of this house.

275
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,711
I can't bear it.

276
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,648
I can't bear being geed up
and encouraged.

277
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,384
Better than being criticised.
- No, it's not.

278
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,087
You see, you don't understand,
I have to be with other people.

279
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,621
Oh, thank you.
- No, not you.

280
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,783
I don't want to leave you. I just...

281
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,129
I want to be myself, that's all.

282
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,663
Oh, let's stop this, it's boring.

283
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,568
Shall we have a whisky?
- Why not?

284
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,495
What shall we drink to?

285
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,606
Us.

286
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:08,498
Best beloved sister.
- Best beloved brother.

287
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,717
Don't you dare leave me alone,
all right?

288
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,181
Promise me you won't.

289
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,290
RUDYARD: Jack?

290
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,329
It's very dark in here.

291
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,499
I suppose it is.

292
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,339
No need to be despondent about today.

293
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,841
I'm not giving up.

294
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,043
I can join the ranks.
- Well, hold your horses.

295
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,180
I'll do whatever it takes, Dad, I...
- There are other avenues we can explore.

296
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,680
What other avenues?
What can you do now?

297
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,885
No, I'm going to join the ranks.

298
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,887
Don't jump the gun.
- I'm not jumping the gun.

299
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,324
What a stupid phrase that is.
- Jack, let me look into it first.

300
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,195
If that doesn't work,
we'll consider your option.

301
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,295
All right?

302
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,414
I'm thrilled you're so keen.

303
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,205
And terribly proud.

304
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,508
We'll get there.

305
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,044
So...

306
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,748
Hold on, old man.

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Very solemn.

308
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:45,821
You will put out that cigarette
before you go up, won't you?

309
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,257
Nobody supports the war
more passionately than I do,

310
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,160
you know that,
but we've pushed him far enough.

311
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
He feels he's failed.

312
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,197
Talk to Ferguson at the war Office.

313
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,534
There must be a job there
which would make him feel valued,

314
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,603
and he'd be working with others
in the same situation.

315
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,105
He wouldn't be so alone.

316
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,690
It'd be clerical.
- Well, if it has to be.

317
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,840
Will you do that for me? Please?

318
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,549
I must go.

319
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,821
Thank you.

320
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,557
I have the British casualty figures...

321
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,992
...for the first day of the battle
for Aubers Ridge.

322
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,061
Four hundred and fifty-eight officers,

323
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:21,085
and eleven thousand, one hundred
and sixty-one men.

324
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
On the first day?

325
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,447
I'm afraid so.
- I can't announce that to the House.

326
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,549
The effect on morale
would be disastrous.

327
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,620
This is precisely the kind of issue
the Prime Minister wants us to tackle.

328
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,288
If our brief is to tell the truth,

329
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,524
but a truth which is bearable
to the British people,

330
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,660
do we dilute the figures?
- I think we have to.

331
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,530
Or do we camouflage them
by emphasising the scale of the victory?

332
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,701
Assuming, that is,
that our troops took Aubers Ridge?

333
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,801
I'm afraid they didn't.

334
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,578
No, people should hear the truth.

335
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,079
These figures will wake up
every young man...

336
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,649
...who's sitting at home,
twiddling his thumbs.

337
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,050
He will read these...

338
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,754
...and know his duty is to the men
who've already sacrificed their lives.

339
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,339
More effective
than any recruiting speech.

340
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,893
Publish the figures in the Times,

341
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:18,903
I'll come up with some words
to accompany them.

342
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,488
Good morning, sir.
Field Marshal Roberts is expecting you.

343
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,588
Thank you.

344
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,886
The Boers taught us a simple lesson.

345
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,033
In modern warfare,
there are three vital ingredients.

346
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,432
Speed, surprise and variety.

347
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,531
So what do we do?

348
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,344
We give the Hun plenty of warning,

349
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,936
we load our boys up
like Christmas trees,

350
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,257
and we forbid them to run.

351
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,844
Recipe for disaster.

352
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,568
What can I do for you, Kipling?

353
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,667
Bobs, I've come to ask a favour.

354
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,839
Hello, Jack. Good to see you.
- Good to see you, Ralph.

355
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,484
I got you a pint.
- Oh, thanks.

356
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,459
God, I'm looking forward to this.

357
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,559
Cheerio.

358
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,539
So how's Sandhurst?
- Splendid, really splendid.

359
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,474
Hard work, but the spirit is wonderful.

360
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,244
We can't wait to get to France.
- When would you go?

361
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,254
I join my regiment next week,
so, soon, I hope.

362
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,946
Why the delay with you?

363
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,386
Oh, it's nothing.
There are one or two issues.

364
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,487
Issues?

365
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:26,242
I'm choosing a regiment,
that sort of thing.

366
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,511
They're from the Royal Sussex.

367
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:37,521
They fought at wipers.
It's probably their first leave.

368
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,388
I've just delivered something for you.

369
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,942
Oh, yes. Thank you, Dadda.

370
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,283
You march up to one
of your powerful pals...

371
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,486
That's enough...
...who's on the point of conking out.

372
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,154
Leave it, Bird.
- No, I won't.

373
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,289
Mother, did you know about this?
- No, I didn't.

374
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,692
Why is he suddenly fit to fight?

375
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,629
I'm in the room, I'm not a cripple.
- We are at war, criteria change.

376
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,932
Rubbish. He can't see five yards
without his specs.

377
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,635
What was the point
of those examinations?

378
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:44,803
Totally humiliating.

379
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,940
And they all said the same thing,
it's too dangerous.

380
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,378
Well, frankly, Father,
it will be your fault if Jack is killed.

381
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,478
Get out.

382
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,047
You should have told me, Rud.

383
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,222
Neither of you understand
what is at stake.

384
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,872
Yes, we do.
- I don't think so.

385
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:13,963
What this country has achieved
over the last 150 years is unique.

386
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,933
We have built up,

387
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,472
painstakingly built up
a family of nations.

388
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,397
Oh, please, Father...
- will you listen to me.

389
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,038
A family of nations,

390
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:34,108
and Britain, as parents,
mother and father,

391
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,693
has an absolute duty
to protect its children.

392
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,594
You're protecting
the wrong family, Father.

393
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,606
I'm sorry the war Office
couldn't come up with something,

394
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,341
but I'm sure you did your best.

395
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,879
Mother.

396
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,618
Congratulations, Jack.

397
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,851
Now, you and I must sit down...

398
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,957
...and make a list
of what you're going to need.

399
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,534
Go on.

400
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,935
OFFICER: Right. Left, right.

401
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,508
About turn.

402
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,865
I can't bear it.

403
00:28:56,534 --> 00:29:00,338
But we've always had Guernseys.
- Not any more, Bird.

404
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,808
If we're going to produce food for
the troops, we have to do it properly.

405
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,177
We'll keep one small herd
of shorthorns for beef,

406
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:10,315
otherwise the whole estate
will be turned over to root crops.

407
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,415
Right.

408
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:18,023
And what can we do to help, Hobdon?
- Start digging, Miss Kipling.

409
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,673
Come on, you fucking new chap.

410
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:26,665
You're supposed to stab that, Kipling,
not tickle it to death.

411
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,765
Is that all you've got?

412
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,568
Come on.

413
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,771
Quickly.

414
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:38,843
This is no time
for personal grooming, Kipling.

415
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,918
Get your scrawny arse back in line.

416
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,015
Come on.

417
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,855
Come along, Mrs Clarke,
best foot forward.

418
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,955
Up and to your left.

419
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,860
Mrs wilson, up and to your right now.

420
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,196
Miss Kipling, up and to your left.

421
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,696
Mrs Kipling, up to your right.
Thank you.

422
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,607
80% of British shells were
defective or duds.

423
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,481
Our guns were so outdated and worn out...

424
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,456
...that our shells fell short
of the German lines,

425
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,926
killing our own wounded
lying in no man's land.

426
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,795
The few British troops
to survive the battle...

427
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,193
...ran back towards safety,

428
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,101
taking with them
a number of German prisoners.

429
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:41,139
Our troops believed it to be
an enemy counterattack and opened fire,

430
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,639
killing all but a handful
of our own men.

431
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,951
Come on, Kipling,
you can do better than that.

432
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:23,147
Thank you for this, O'Leary.
- Not at all, sir.

433
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,268
O'LEARY: Seventy-two, sir.

434
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,507
Better, sir. Eighty-one.

435
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,981
Come here.
- It's my turn to read.

436
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,121
No, it certainly is not.

437
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:15,994
'Dear old things, plus Bird,
as you can see from the enclosed photo,

438
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:19,757
'I am no longer
a mewling, squawking cadet,

439
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,568
'but a fully fledged,
highly commissioned officer.'

440
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,503
Let me see.

441
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:29,274
'You are looking
at Second Lieutenant John Kipling.'

442
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,909
Show me.

443
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,009
Doesn't he look fine?

444
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,443
'Corporal O'Leary has prodded me...

445
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:38,216
...and pushed me and
knocked me into shape.

446
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,886
'He tells me
I am now ready to command men.

447
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,627
'Raw recruits arrive from Dublin
any day now.

448
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,993
'Twenty of them will be my platoon.

449
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:54,533
'It's my job to turn them
into hard-bitten professional soldiers.

450
00:33:54,632 --> 00:34:00,242
'I am more windy about meeting them
than about going over the top.'

451
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,342
Sir, 5 Platoon is waiting outside, sir.

452
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,154
Officer.

453
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,059
On your feet, yous lazy bastards.

454
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,090
Up.

455
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,029
I am Lieutenant Kipling.
I am your Platoon Commander.

456
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:30,435
Together we are 5 Platoon, 2 Company,
2nd Battalion Irish Guards.

457
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,504
Before you start your training,
I want to ask you all a question.

458
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,259
It's very simple.
Why did you join the army?

459
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,104
You?
- Me, sir?

460
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,612
To see the world, sir.

461
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,015
King and country, sir.

462
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,185
Money.

463
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,258
Safer for me to fight the Germans...

464
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,361
...than be at home in Dublin
just at the minute,

465
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,926
if you know what I mean, sir.

466
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,634
The thing is, whatever your reasons,
you all volunteered,

467
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,303
no one forced you to be here.

468
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,472
And in a week's time,
when you want to shoot me in the head,

469
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,841
I'd like you to remember that.

470
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,642
But I promise you one thing,

471
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,246
I won't ask you to do anything
I wouldn't do myself.

472
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,509
O'LEARY:28, 29,

473
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,219
30.

474
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,721
What's the matter, Daley? Are you tired?

475
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,857
Would you like a nice cup of tea?

476
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,924
Thirty-three.

477
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,659
Come on, you shower-lad shites.

478
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,828
Thirty-four.

479
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,125
Are you all totally bloody useless?

480
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,232
Thirty-five.

481
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,603
Thirty-six.

482
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,571
Thirty-seven.

483
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,671
Thirty-eight.

484
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,707
Thirty-nine.

485
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,909
Forty.

486
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:52,521
I think you should stop now, sir.
You're embarrassing these ladies.

487
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,683
On your feet.

488
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,132
O'LEARY: Attention.

489
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,201
Commence firing.

490
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,076
Cease firing.

491
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,780
Guardsman Daley, 52.

492
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,617
Guardsman Doyle, 48.

493
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,521
Guardsman Bowe, 58.

494
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,853
Guardsman McHugh, 77.

495
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,060
Lieutenant Kipling,

496
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,629
93.

497
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:12,093
I would like to tell you
how the rhino got his skin.

498
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,434
I am the Parsee Pestonjee Bomonjee,
sitting in my palm tree,

499
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,694
and you are all rhinoceri.

500
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,709
Which is what happens
when there is more than one rhinoceros.

501
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:30,504
And you have all come down for a bathe
on the shores of the Red Sea.

502
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,800
But to do that
you must remove your skins.

503
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,265
Unbutton your skins, please.

504
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,798
Sit on your skins, please.

505
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,458
Now,

506
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,568
let me return you to the beginning.

507
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,873
Once upon a time, on an...

508
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,629
Ah, Lieutenant Kipling.

509
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,605
Down on the floor, please.

510
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,705
Remove your skin.

511
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,508
And sit upon it.

512
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Hello, Peter.

513
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:09,918
Once upon a time,
on an uninhabited island,

514
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,021
there lived a Parsee...

515
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:16,194
...from whose hat
the rays of the sun were reflected...

516
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,889
...in more than oriental splendour.

517
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,067
What do you think
of the moustache, Mother?

518
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,167
You look older.

519
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,305
Is that a good thing?
- Of course it is.

520
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,340
I may be biased, but I like it.

521
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,932
You look very...

522
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,206
...dashing.

523
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,215
He does. You look very handsome.

524
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,442
He looks very smug to me.

525
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,986
You've got a secret.

526
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,021
What is it?

527
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,941
The Battalion sails next week.

528
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,094
I'm going to France.

529
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,699
But why now? Couldn't they
have given you any warning?

530
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,167
Well, we knew it was coming.

531
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,037
But it's so sudden.
- That's good news, old man.

532
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,339
The waiting's over.

533
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,414
So this is your last weekend?
- Yes.

534
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,461
Here's to you, old man.

535
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,209
You must be awful excited.

536
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,403
I am.
- I wish I could be in your shoes now.

537
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,407
Take one of mine, Dad.

538
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,510
Thank you.

539
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,717
Mind you, I must give up.

540
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,382
It does the inside cupboards
no good at all.

541
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,769
Have they told you where you're going?

542
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,949
Not officially.
But we know how much hangs on it.

543
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,442
I shouldn't tell you this,

544
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,312
but the Great Advance kicks off
on August 17th.

545
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,452
Your birthday.
- Exactly.

546
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,083
General Haking says
it'll be the greatest battle...

547
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,118
...in the history of the world.

548
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,218
Right.

549
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,991
It's possible we may leave
a few days before my birthday.

550
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,927
I wondered
if you'd write a letter to the regiment...

551
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:34,192
...to give me permission
to go over before I'm 18.

552
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,800
'The greatest battle
in the history of the world.'

553
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,277
Oh, I don't want to miss it.
I want to be in the thick of it.

554
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,377
Of course you do.

555
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,219
Who am I writing to?

556
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,558
I have got some important things
to give you.

557
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,327
First and foremost, a bar of chocolate.

558
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,763
Can I eat it now?
- Which you can't eat now.

559
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,559
Secondly, the key to my shed.

560
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,302
My own key?
- Your own key. Do not lose it.

561
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,475
And thirdly,
a list of things to be getting on with.

562
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,876
I want you to read it to me now,

563
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,631
so you'll absolutely know
what's to be done.

564
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,616
One,

565
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:29,371
oil the chain once a week.
Not too much oil.

566
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,453
Two,

567
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,248
clean the plugs.

568
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,726
I don't know how to.

569
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,330
Which is precisely why
I'm going to show you.

570
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,228
When you come back...
- Yes?

571
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,901
...will you bring me something?

572
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,976
What do you fancy?
- A German shell.

573
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,639
I shall try.

574
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,953
Have you packed your spare glasses?

575
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,053
Yes.
- Show me.

576
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,458
Good.

577
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,528
Jack. You ought to leave.

578
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,630
Coming.

579
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,567
You look so fine.

580
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,240
How did you get those buttons so shiny?
They're like mirrors.

581
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,210
Someone does it for me, that's how.

582
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,390
Don't worry.
Corporal O'Leary will look after me.

583
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,051
Well, I'll blame him then
if anything happens to you.

584
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,620
RUDYARD: Jack, we're up against it.

585
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
I'm off.

586
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,441
I won't come down.
- All right.

587
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,768
Be careful.
- I will.

588
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,474
Bye.

589
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,895
Bye, Bird.

590
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,369
Come on, old man.

591
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,972
Look after yourself.

592
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,407
Go, Jack. Go on.

593
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,196
Thank you.

594
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,305
Good luck.

595
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,405
Bye, Dadda.

596
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,761
Sixteen officers from warley Barracks
have died already.

597
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,899
And Ralph, killed on his first day.

598
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,695
Frightening, a bit.

599
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,767
Of course it is.

600
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,803
You'll be all right.

601
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,893
The sooner I get out there, the better.
- Absolutely.

602
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,944
Bye.

603
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,415
Bye.

604
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:33,166
Oh, that's a heavy one.
- Thank you, Mrs Kipling.

605
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,250
News from the warrior.

606
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,495
Oh. Let me see.
- How is he?

607
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,364
On good form, actually.

608
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,092
Very wet, but in good spirits.

609
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,035
'Bonjour, old things, plus Bird.

610
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,973
'Just a hurried line
to tell you I am A-1.

611
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:54,478
'I have never been so fit.
We marched 60 miles in 36 hours.

612
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,547
'It is raining here like Hades.

613
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,782
'Will you send me an oilskin coat,

614
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:02,019
'one of those black things
that the sailors wear in the North Sea?

615
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,457
'Could you try it on first, Dad?
It must be good and roomy.

616
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:10,794
'The Germans seem
to be getting into their stride here,

617
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,158
'but we'll be ready.

618
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:17,258
'Will write again soon
if we ever stop marching.

619
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,435
'Dear love, John.'

620
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,206
ELSIE: Sixty miles.

621
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,241
He must be exhausted.

622
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:32,273
Is that thunder?
- It sounds like it.

623
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,574
No, the wind has changed.

624
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,619
It's from the south.

625
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,723
From France.

626
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,067
I'd rather go over the top
than examine your feet...

627
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,735
...three times a week, Bowe.

628
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,837
Oh, my feet are delightful.

629
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,572
I wouldn't mind the gangrene setting in,

630
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:59,243
then they'll be after whisking me away
to a nice, warm hospital bed.

631
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,312
DALY: Jesus. I bet there's creatures
in there having the meal of their lives.

632
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,412
Look at this, sir.

633
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,032
That must hurt.
- It does, sir.

634
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,248
Is it the trench foot?
- No.

635
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,223
No, the foot's a good colour.

636
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,491
Will you powder me, Doyle?

637
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,716
Fuck off.
- Bring it here.

638
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Thank you, sir.

639
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,567
Oh, Jesus Christ, that feels good.

640
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,235
Oh, Jesus, that's lovely.

641
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:31,455
Jesus, I've just had a terrible image
of you in bed with your wife, Bowe.

642
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:38,185
McHUGH: Jesus fuck.
BOwE: Mother of God, that was close.

643
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,039
Any sign of Jerry?
- None, sir.

644
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,062
Your feet are important to me, Bowe.

645
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:57,347
I want them fit to dance
a victory jig in the German trenches.

646
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,307
To Jack.

647
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,612
We're thinking of you, old man.

648
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:15,519
It would be a happier birthday
if you were here with us at Bateman's.

649
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,619
But we're awful proud,

650
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,937
and wish you all the luck in the world.

651
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,165
Happy birthday, Jack.

652
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:32,005
Happy birthday, Jack.
- Happy birthday, Jack.

653
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,931
# Happy birthday to you...

654
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,475
...# Happy birthday to you...

655
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:49,717
...# Happy birthday,
dear Lieutenant Kipling...

656
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,548
...# Happy birthday to you #

657
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,258
Thanks, boys.

658
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,665
I've a birthday present
for you, Kipling.

659
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,873
When do we go over, sir?
- Tomorrow morning.

660
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,973
7:30.

661
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:23,820
Hobdon suggests we grow a white cabbage
called Holland Late during the winter.

662
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,758
Apparently, it's the only brassica
that will stand the journey.

663
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,858
Do you agree? Rud?

664
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,550
I'm sorry, I wasn't...
- It's not important.

665
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,598
Do you want a story?
- No, thank you.

666
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,273
JACK: Dear old things, plus Bird,

667
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,875
funny to think
one will be in the thick of it tomorrow.

668
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:22,045
One's first experience
of shellfire in the open.

669
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:25,549
It is great luck that my first action
should be such an important one.

670
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,618
You have no idea what enormous issues
depend on the next few days.

671
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,788
If we succeed,
the war won't go on for long.

672
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,357
We won't have any time for writing,

673
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:36,193
so this may be my last letter
for some time.

674
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:39,387
So long, old dears. Dear love, John.

675
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,875
Ten minutes, O'Leary.

676
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,479
O'LEARY: Ten minutes.

677
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,782
Check your weapons.

678
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,554
Chins up, lads.
- SOLDIER: Gas masks.

679
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,324
I can't get this strap over.
McHugh, help me get the strap over.

680
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,915
McHugh.
- Fuck off, Bowe.

681
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,597
Jesus Christ, my gun's blocked.

682
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:53,236
Shit, there's mud in the barrel.
Oh, God, I've got to clean it out.

683
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,827
Come on, come on, come on.

684
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,109
Don't piss in my direction,
you filthy bastard.

685
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,609
Don't be pointing
that scabby cock at me.

686
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,846
Shit, shit, come on.

687
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:10,327
I've been shitting and pissing all day
and now I can't go.

688
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,647
Listen, when you go over,

689
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,650
you will see Chalk Pit wood
500 yards ahead of you.

690
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,352
Advance straight for the trees.

691
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:45,589
5 Platoon has been instructed
to take pigeon baskets.

692
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,324
It is of A-1 importance...

693
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,093
...that you hold on to these
until you get to the German trenches.

694
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:51,862
McHUGH: What are they for, sir?

695
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,865
When you reach the enemy trenches,
you will release your pigeon.

696
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,067
It will then fly back to HQ,

697
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:01,938
and senior officers will be alerted
that we have done our job.

698
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,038
Two minutes.

699
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,044
How are you supposed to climb out
of the trench, let alone fucking run?

700
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:09,312
Sir?

701
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,681
What?
- Sir, my pigeon's dead, sir.

702
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,217
What?
- My pigeon's dead, what shall I do?

703
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:15,318
How do you know it's dead?

704
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,220
It's lying at the bottom of the basket,
sir, it's not moving.

705
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,320
Oh, for God's sake.

706
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,491
Do I have to take the basket across,
sir, if the pigeon's dead?

707
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,460
Well, no, if you're sure it's dead,
then, no, of course not.

708
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:29,340
So I dump the basket, then?
- Yes, just dump the bloody basket, Bowe.

709
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,575
One minute.

710
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,864
Fix bayonets.

711
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,464
Oh, mother of God.

712
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,718
I can't do it, my fingers won't work.

713
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,383
Thank you, sir.

714
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,535
Front rank, about turn.

715
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,725
Telegram, Mr Kipling.

716
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,432
Thank you very much.

717
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,650
No, no, no.

718
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,391
Was that the post?

719
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,928
No.
- He is not dead.

720
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,631
Jack.
- He is missing.

721
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,601
Believed wounded.

722
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,138
He might not be seriously hurt,

723
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:12,275
he may very well have
strolled into HQ by now,

724
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:17,985
and he may have got lost. That happens
fairly frequently, you know.

725
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,147
We should have stopped him.

726
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,325
ELSIE: I'm back.

727
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,396
Hello.
- Hello, Bird.

728
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,496
Complete success.

729
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:39,068
One spare Orilux battery,
one edition Tatler.

730
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:44,268
And, this will please him,
one pair of good bedroom slippers.

731
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,277
He's been killed?
- No.

732
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,981
No, he's missing.

733
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,221
Missing?

734
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,321
Believed wounded.

735
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,224
He'll come home, then.

736
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,360
He'll be fine.

737
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,468
RUDYARD: Bird.

738
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,271
Why did you let him go?

739
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,411
I didn't let him go.
He went because he wanted to.

740
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,551
You've missed the point.

741
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,544
God, you just... You've no idea.

742
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,388
Don't you realise
he didn't give a damn about your cause?

743
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:36,313
The reason he went
to get his head shot off...

744
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,219
...was to get away from us.

745
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:42,889
To escape this dark, depressing house.

746
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,808
To be rid of us. To be rid of home.

747
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:51,474
What does that do
to your theories, Father?

748
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,260
Is that...
Is that reason enough to fight?

749
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,695
Is that an honourable sacrifice, is it?

750
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,484
Is it?

751
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,020
I don't think so.

752
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,020
Ten columns of British infantry
attacked along a six and a...

753
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
I'm sorry I'm late.

754
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,863
We were just discussing
the Battle of Loos.

755
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,966
I don't want you to feel...
- Not at all. No.

756
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,435
I still have
a very hazy view of the facts.

757
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:56,164
I'd appreciate a more detailed picture.

758
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,273
Carry on, please.

759
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,044
Please.

760
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:15,024
The British bombardment was ineffective,

761
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,609
and we ran out of shells
after 90 minutes.

762
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,528
German machine-gun
posts were undamaged.

763
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:30,195
385 officers and 7,861 men were killed
or wounded in the first attack.

764
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:36,799
The Germans already refer to the battle
as 'The Field of Corpses'.

765
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:42,251
A further 600 Irish and Scots Guards
were declared missing, believed wounded.

766
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,755
A substantial number of British troops
were taken prisoner.

767
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,390
We are investigating reports...

768
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:52,845
...that these prisoners are being treated
in an inhumane manner.

769
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,455
However, in some places,

770
01:03:56,432 --> 01:04:00,103
up to 2,000 yards of enemy territory
was taken.

771
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,262
In spite of the cost,

772
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:05,204
Loos was a victory.

773
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,554
I've had a good day, a good day.

774
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:19,889
Would you like to hear
what I've achieved?

775
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,124
Yes, please.

776
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,761
I have arranged meetings at the
Irish Guard Depot and Swiss Red Cross.

777
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,363
Mmm-hmm.
- And I have written to the war Office,

778
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:31,167
and five hospitals I know
that have wards of wounded troops.

779
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,635
What do you think?
- Excellent.

780
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,103
And I have written you a list of people...

781
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,973
...that I think you should contact
to speed things up.

782
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,208
You used your influence
to get Jack into the army,

783
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,878
you can use your influence
to find him now.

784
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,644
I'm going to the post office.

785
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:49,218
We have more than 4,000 photographs
of prisoners in German hands.

786
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,120
Could you send us a copy of those?

787
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,222
All of them?
- We'll only need the recent ones.

788
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:56,592
No, I'd like to see all of them, please.

789
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,412
Thank you so much for your time.

790
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,800
HAYDEN: One shouldn't necessarily
expect the worst.

791
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,203
All the information we're receiving
about the battle...

792
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,571
...points to a deal of confusion.

793
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,606
I'd like to contact you
on a daily basis.

794
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,408
We'll get in touch with you
if there's any news.

795
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:13,509
No, I'd like to do it.

796
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:17,009
What would be the best time
to telephone?

797
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,296
No.

798
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,033
No.

799
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,133
No.

800
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,404
No.

801
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,504
No.

802
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,342
No.

803
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,442
No.

804
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,844
No.
- No.

805
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,190
We'll go through them once again.

806
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,959
Let's do them tomorrow.
- I'll check them once again.

807
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,128
Let's do them tomorrow,
we need to sleep.

808
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,228
Go to bed, then.

809
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,899
All right, come on.

810
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:47,803
We'll check them again.

811
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,273
No, not if you're going to huff
and puff. I'd rather do it on my own.

812
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,008
Carrie, we'll check them again.

813
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,514
Pass me a photograph.

814
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,652
No.
- No.

815
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,722
No.

816
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,626
No.

817
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:11,994
No.

818
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,094
No.

819
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,045
You work long hours.
- Look.

820
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,340
That is the cleanest motorcycle
I have ever seen.

821
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,667
How long did it take?
- All afternoon.

822
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:53,767
I'm not surprised.

823
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,674
Does your mother know you're here?
- Yes.

824
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,684
Let's have a cup of tea
and I'll walk you home.

825
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,356
Can we have a story?

826
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,759
Good idea.

827
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:26,228
This is a tale of Captain Jack Kipling...

828
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:29,972
...and Lieutenant Peter Carter, that's you,

829
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,302
of the Bengal Lancers.

830
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:36,563
Finest cavalry officers
of their generation.

831
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:41,682
Straight-backed, tight-kneed, keen-eyed.

832
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,015
They patrol the Grand Trunk Road.

833
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,258
Have you heard of that great road?
- No.

834
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:53,158
It is the longest road in India.

835
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:56,527
The backbone of all Hindustan.

836
01:08:57,066 --> 01:09:01,127
Fifteen hundred miles,
and straight as a ruler.

837
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:06,499
All castes and kinds of men move here.

838
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,609
It is a river of life.

839
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:12,180
All the world, going and coming.

840
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:14,984
But all the world stops...

841
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:18,087
...to watch Lieutenant Peter Carter...

842
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,187
...and...

843
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,370
And...

844
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,778
And Captain Jack Kipling...

845
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:51,051
...trot by.

846
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,356
Is Jack dead?

847
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,994
Not certain, old man.
Not certain at all.

848
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:14,058
Not even sure he should have gone
in the first place.

849
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:29,391
CARRIE: One more tiny question.
Where did you see him?

850
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:33,596
Was it the southern end
or the northern end of Chalk Pit wood?

851
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,165
It's difficult to be precise.
- Let me help you.

852
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,000
Carrie.
- Just a minute, Rud.

853
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,569
At the southern end there's a large pond...

854
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:43,539
...between the edge of the wood
and the chalk escarpment.

855
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:47,309
Now in order to circle the wood,
you have to pass the pond.

856
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:49,570
Does that ring a bell?

857
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,181
It does, yes.
I definitely passed a pond.

858
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,816
Well, that's very useful.

859
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,852
Thank you, Captain Bruce,
you've been incredibly helpful.

860
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,688
I'm delighted to have been some use.
- Oh, you definitely have.

861
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,790
Let me find my daughter
and she'll show you out.

862
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,890
Thank you.

863
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,960
Right through here.

864
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,634
Tired.

865
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,871
Tired to the tiredest degree.

866
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:21,902
Rud, that is very encouraging.
- It is not encouraging.

867
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,947
It is not encouraging because
Bruce saw Jack at half past three.

868
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:30,352
We already have at least three sightings
of Jack alive an hour and a half later.

869
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,523
So fascinating though Bruce's account
is, it is utterly, utterly irrelevant.

870
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,226
It is not irrelevant.
I need to get the whole picture.

871
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,129
We've got the whole bloody picture,
that's the point.

872
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,229
You've given up hope.

873
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,995
No, I haven't. I haven't at all. But...

874
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,541
One more sighting, early in the battle,

875
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:56,270
does not constitute proof
that he is alive.

876
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,646
It's something.

877
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:06,182
Oh, I'd like a cigarette.
- Well, that won't help.

878
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,343
Have you hidden them?
- I threw them away.

879
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,395
Oh.

880
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,468
I know.

881
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,313
Not mine, Jack's.

882
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,684
I found them ages ago.

883
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:41,734
He should have chosen another author.
I'm always dipping into Trollope.

884
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,558
May I see?

885
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,550
Allah be praised.

886
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:12,050
That is exactly why you shouldn't smoke.

887
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,187
Fouler than foul.

888
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,497
I'll find you, Jack.

889
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,900
We will.

890
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:46,386
Can I help you?

891
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:55,348
Is this the home
of Lieutenant John Kipling?

892
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,773
I recognise you from the pictures,
of course.

893
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,747
The men are after singing your verses
at the front, did you know that?

894
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,847
That's very flattering.

895
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,427
I believe you knew my son?

896
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,855
Very gentle.

897
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,192
Very kind.

898
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,961
What was your platoon?

899
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,766
Guardsman Michael Bowe, 7786.

900
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,335
5th Platoon, 2 Company,
2nd Battalion, Irish Guards.

901
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,580
So my son was your Platoon Commander?

902
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,743
He was always worried about me feet.
- Your feet?

903
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,846
He powdered them
the day before we went over.

904
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,681
They were in a dreadful state
on account of the rain.

905
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,883
CARRIE: Was it raining?
Was it raining on the day?

906
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,752
Just a minute.
- On the day with Jack, was it raining?

907
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,320
Carrie, please.

908
01:14:55,524 --> 01:15:01,986
Mr Bowe, we have been interviewing
Irish Guards every day for many months.

909
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:09,296
You are the first soldier I have met
from my son's platoon.

910
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:14,510
If you know something, anything,
that will help us,

911
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,820
we would be very grateful.

912
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,630
To know, one way or the other,

913
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:25,408
would be a great release
for the whole family.

914
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,589
Please.

915
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,858
Please.

916
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:40,436
Do you know what I see
when I go over the top?

917
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,536
RUDYARD: What?

918
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,840
A game of football.

919
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:52,047
The next regiment's attacking the Boche
with their rifles shouldered,

920
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:55,377
dribbling a ball across no man's land.

921
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,787
And there's a bloke striding out
with a walking stick.

922
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:02,755
Like a gent
on a Sunday jaunt in Phoenix Park.

923
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,280
The bullets are all around me...

924
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,996
...like bees.

925
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:15,252
A swarm of angry bees
buzzing and racing past me ear.

926
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:20,758
Jimmy Doyle on one side,
the Lieutenant on the other.

927
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,476
Jimmy goes down.

928
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,450
And I'm shouting,
'we're the only two left, sir.'

929
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:34,245
My lungs are bursting, but we make it
into Jerry's frontline trench.

930
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,191
And I'm lying there,

931
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,227
trying to breathe.

932
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:45,332
Lying... Lying on top...

933
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,836
God. God.

934
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,079
God.

935
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,318
No.

936
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:08,588
Bowe.

937
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,928
Stay close.

938
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,537
Halt.
- Sorry, sir.

939
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,096
We can't take that, sir.
- That, McHugh, is why we are here.

940
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:51,266
We are to attack and destroy
the machine-gun post on Puits bis 14.

941
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,036
I'm not fucking going anywhere.
- You are, we all are.

942
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:56,338
You're a murderer.
You're a fucking murderer.

943
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,341
I'm not a murderer, McHugh,
I'm obeying orders.

944
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,511
Right, Casey, Joyce, McHugh,
right flank.

945
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,611
Bowe, Flynn, with me.

946
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,118
Come on, boys.

947
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,805
Jack.

948
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:26,726
Go on.

949
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,698
Please.

950
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,532
He was in such pain, sir.

951
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:44,911
What did you do?

952
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,597
You didn't help him?

953
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,038
No, sir.

954
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,413
By all accounts he was very brave.

955
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:44,927
So few of us have the opportunity
to play our part properly.

956
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,534
But he did.

957
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:52,185
He achieved what he set out to achieve.

958
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,178
He must have been in such awful pain.

959
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,513
If you talk to wounded soldiers,

960
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:02,353
they'll tell you
the pain only sets in later.

961
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:05,919
So he was lucky.

962
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,813
It was done with quickly.

963
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:13,154
Don't tell me he was lucky.

964
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:18,255
He wasn't lucky or brave or happy.

965
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,467
Jack was 18 years and one day old.

966
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,640
He died in the rain,
he couldn't see a thing, he was alone.

967
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,143
You can't persuade me
there's any glory in that.

968
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,243
I believe there is.

969
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,779
I can't listen to this.

970
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,406
No.
- Let go of me.

971
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:37,052
Look, do you want me
to get down on my knees...

972
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:39,020
...and admit that I murdered my son?

973
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,622
I will if it satisfies you.

974
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:43,357
Please let go of me.
- Do you...

975
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:47,662
Do you think a single day passes
when I don't consider that possibility?

976
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:51,417
I think about it all the time.
All the time.

977
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:57,962
And what truly terrifies me
is that if I am to blame,

978
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,169
what have I sent him on to,

979
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,945
if anything at all?

980
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:13,420
How could I condemn my son to oblivion?

981
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:20,121
How could I do that to Jack?

982
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:29,268
But I miss him.

983
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,418
So do I.

984
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,312
I can feel his head on my chest.

985
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,699
I can feel his thick hair
under my fingers.

986
01:23:57,799 --> 01:23:59,799
I can hear him laugh.

987
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:03,437
I can feel his heat against me.

988
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,916
We'll manage.

989
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,025
Oh, yes, we'll manage.

990
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,195
I don't doubt that.

991
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,701
I'll go find Bird.

992
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,571
Will you be all right?

993
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,574
Yes, thank you.

994
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:28,481
Bed.

995
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:57,489
He would have found a way...

996
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:01,021
...even if you'd tried to stop him.

997
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,314
He was where he wanted to be.

998
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,886
I know that.

999
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:19,098
I let him down.

1000
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,483
Do you want a story?

1001
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:41,787
Yes, please.

1002
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:57,003
Well...

1003
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:00,940
This, O best beloved,

1004
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:06,790
is another story
of the high and far off times...

1005
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:28,909
I didn't time you, I'm afraid.
- Of course not.

1006
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,872
It was awful slow anyway.

1007
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:35,392
I was stuck behind a herd of cattle
for half an hour.

1008
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,883
Bugger all you can do about that.

1009
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,691
Who would have a son?

1010
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:54,929
Breaks your heart.

1011
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:57,398
I was so sorry to hear your news, sir.

1012
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,498
Thank you.

1013
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,438
The fact that he was the youngest
made it worse.

1014
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:06,701
How old was he?
- Thirteen.

1015
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:14,579
He was lying on the floor
of his bedroom.

1016
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:20,776
Do you mind me telling you this?
- Not at all.

1017
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:24,752
Lying... Lying on his back.

1018
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,463
He had just had a fit.

1019
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,834
Dead.

1020
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,536
But he was still warm.

1021
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,206
And...

1022
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:43,437
...that was a great relief.

1023
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,604
I'd have hated to have...

1024
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:53,681
I'd have hated to have found him cold.

1025
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:58,063
Does that seem odd?
- No.

1026
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,531
Have you news of my boy Jack?

1027
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:10,803
Not this tide...

1028
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:15,076
...when do you think that he'll come back?

1029
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:18,576
Not with this wind blowing,
and this tide

1030
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:23,051
Has anyone else had word of him?

1031
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:25,151
Not this tide

1032
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,389
For what is sunk will hardly swim

1033
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,889
Not with this wind blowing,
and this tide

1034
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:35,828
Oh, dear...

1035
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,329
...what comfort can I find?

1036
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,669
None this tide, nor any tide

1037
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,628
Except he did not shame his kind

1038
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:54,603
Not even with that wind blowing,
and that tide

1039
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:58,152
Then hold your head up all the more

1040
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:00,743
This tide, and every tide

1041
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:09,663
Because he was the son you bore

1042
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:21,134
And gave to that wind blowing
and that tide.
