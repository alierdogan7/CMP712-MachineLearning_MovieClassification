1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,591
<i>As I walk down the overgrown path
through the forest, -</i>

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,112
<i>- my heart trembles
wlth supernatural joy.</i>

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,228
<i>I remember a place near
the east coast of the Casplan Sea -</i>

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,149
<i>- where once I stood.
It was Ilke here.</i>

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,388
<i>And the water was calm,
heavy and Iron-grey, as now.</i>

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,679
<i>I walked through the forest.
I was moved to tears, euphorlc.</i>

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,433
<i>I sald, "God In heaven,
to thlnk I'd ever walk here agalnl"</i>

8
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,757
<i>As If I'd been there before.</i>

9
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,152
Father...

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,557
It's over.
Germany has surrendered.

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,554
<i>The Reich Minister has declared
unconditional surrender...</i>

12
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,149
Are you Hamsun? The traitor?

13
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,155
Mothertold me
to throw back your book.

14
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,794
Why did you become a traitor?

15
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,718
Why?

16
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,639
<i>My dear Marle, when I woke up
In my hotel room last nlght, -</i>

17
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,799
<i>- I went over to the wlndow.
The bird cherry was In bloom.</i>

18
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,039
<i>And you were there
In every Ilttle part of the flower.</i>

19
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,313
<i>You lovely, healthy,
obllglng country girl.</i>

20
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,115
<i>You who were stagestruck
four years ago.</i>

21
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,030
<i>Innocent, and wlth unsurpassed
skllls as a wife and a mother.</i>

22
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,074
<i>I must conslder whether
a stagestruck girl Ilke yourself-</i>

23
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,236
<i>- can marry a man -</i>

24
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,877
<i>- who opposes these Interests
wlth every fibre of hls body.</i>

25
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>I wlll always love you.</i>

26
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,478
A day'swork wasted.

27
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,038
Stop whining.

28
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,355
A day'swork wasted?!

29
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,590
When was the last time
you wrote anything?

30
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,079
<i>You said yourself, you were
washed-up, finished. Well, I'm not!</i>

31
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,035
<i>- I'm moving out tomorrow.
- What a relief.</i>

32
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,714
What a relief! Butwhy did you have
to take up 30 years of my life?

33
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,233
If only you had drowned yourself
30 years ago and let me have a life.

34
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,797
What a fool I've been.
You lied!

35
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,472
You nevercared forme.
You were disappointed.

36
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,079
Yes.

37
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,274
The holy mother.
The holy, soiled hands.

38
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,954
The depraved city where you sat in
the hotel, writing about the soil, -

39
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,392
- leaving me to have children.
You even took the theatre from me.

40
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,798
You mocked it.
You promised me a leading part.

41
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,198
<i>- You said you'd write me a play.
- So thatwaswhy you...</i>

42
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,951
<i>You are a terrible playwright!
Terrible!</i>

43
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,076
Then you got me pregnant and
went on about yourhigh principles.

44
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,037
You've whored yourideals to death,
whored in every possible way.

45
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,917
<i>At yourown family's expense.
Whored, you have! Whored! Whored!</i>

46
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,238
<i>God almighty, I'm 76!</i>

47
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,390
How about that fool of an actor
you whored with?

48
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,558
To die of volvulus. Pathetic!

49
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,949
My dear little Knut.
Back then you were jealous.

50
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,389
<i>At least I didn't feel small.
He didn't belittle me.</i>

51
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,628
- 30 years ago, but you remember.
- Shrunk and belittled.

52
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,154
Just this small.
Oh, you get yourway.

53
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,990
No doubt everyone flocked around
the Nobel Prize winnerin Oslo, -

54
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,273
- while I was left here to play
the little country girl.

55
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,631
And the children...

56
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,911
The children were sent away
so as not to disturb the great mind.

57
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,280
<i>What have you done to us?
I'm 54 years old, Knut.</i>

58
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,872
You've made me old.
You moulded me!

59
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,957
Moulded me!

60
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
I tried to please you.
But I was nevergood enough.

61
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,037
I was good enough when you were
away and wrote me love letters.

62
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,394
Butwhen you came home
and saw me, I was nevergood enough.

63
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,635
You've made me ugly!

64
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,992
God almighty.
We've made each otherugly.

65
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,036
<i>- What matters is that I'm dying.
- But I want to live!</i>

66
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,073
- Good.
- Now!

67
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,236
Good.

68
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,668
I hold the ideals
you've given me, Knut.

69
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,873
- Good.
- I hold them, though you failed me.

70
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,439
<i>Did you everreally like
the children's books I wrote?</i>

71
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,200
<i>What matters is that I'm dying.</i>

72
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,837
Did you think my books
were any good?

73
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,634
<i>It's such a long time ago.</i>

74
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,714
Do you want a divorce?

75
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,114
<i>From Knut Hamsun?
A king doesn't tolerate divorce.</i>

76
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,472
<i>Queens just have to live with that.
It's theirrole.</i>

77
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,956
<i>Well, there's yourrole then,
my dear.</i>

78
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,469
<i>Our mlsfortune, Marle, -</i>

79
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,550
<i>- Is that I, who so desplse
the theatre, love an actress.</i>

80
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,197
<i>"The countess of the field
isn't there.</i>

81
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,473
<i>Ingeris inside cooking. "</i>

82
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,915
<i>"Tall and majestic. Avestal virgin
lighting up the stove. "</i>

83
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,433
<i>"Ingerhas sailed the seven seas
and seen the big city, -</i>

84
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,234
<i>- but now she's home again. "</i>

85
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,558
<i>"The world is big
and swarming with dots. "</i>

86
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,354
<i>"Ingerswarmed too. "</i>

87
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,351
<i>"She was hardly anyone
among men. Only one. "</i>

88
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,279
<i>"And now it is night. "</i>

89
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,878
When Knut Hamsun received the
Nobel Prize forliterature in 1920, -

90
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,471
- it only confirmed
what everyone knew:

91
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,719
That he is the greatest
Norwegian alive today.

92
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,875
He has brought to life
everything that is Norwegian.

93
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,674
<i>Indeed, he Is Norway.</i>

94
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,908
Tonight, we've once again
felt the magic-

95
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,829
- in the words of
this Norwegian giant.

96
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,318
Thank you very much,
Mrs Hamsun. Thank you.

97
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,910
We humbly ask you to give the
great poet of Norholm ourregards.

98
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,635
- May we ask that of you?
- I'll give him yourregards.

99
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,150
From all of us.
From the whole world!

100
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,113
- I will tell... the great poet.
- Thank you.

101
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,389
We are honoured. Yourwife called
and said you wanted to stay here.

102
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,352
Fora while.

103
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,473
- Yourwife called...
- Iwant to stay here.

104
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,910
She called
in the middle of the night.

105
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,352
<i>Are you still talking about my wife?
Don't talk about her.</i>

106
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,198
Go away.

107
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,837
<i>So it's over?</i>

108
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,433
Strange. Justwhen the end
of life itself is near.

109
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,316
- Have you thought about that?
- Why did you give up writing?

110
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,071
<i>It's a long time ago you were here.
That'swhat I've thought about.</i>

111
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,118
I understand
yourhatred forhim, but...

112
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,315
Fatheris so strong.
So very unreasonably strong.

113
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,876
<i>- But if he's dying...
- What if he isn't?</i>

114
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,029
<i>He won't die unless he wants to.
Mother's problem is...</i>

115
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,679
<i>When you've gone through what
you have, it's hard to split up.</i>

116
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,714
Little Tore, little Arild,
little Ellinor, -

117
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,273
- little Cecilia, little Marie -

118
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,951
- and Knut the Great.
A propermodel family.

119
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,110
<i>- I'm so glad I got away from you.
- I didn'twant you to forget us.</i>

120
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,834
It belongs here at Norholm.

121
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,198
<i>It's absurd that father's living
at the inn. Have him come home.</i>

122
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,518
<i>- Cecilia!
- It's embarrassing.</i>

123
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,799
Adolf Hitleris showing the way
to the greater Europe -

124
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,073
- where Norway will take
its place of honourat the table.

125
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,195
And where the women of Norway, too,
will take theirrightful place.

126
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,997
They carry the ideals, nurture our
young and set an example to us men.

127
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,035
They are the keepers of good morals,
the centre of the family.

128
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,598
In the struggle against decadence,
they stay in the bosom of the family.

129
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,477
And there, with theirstrength and
theirpure faces facing the sun, -

130
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,549
- they will play the leading role
in the future -

131
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,551
- forwhich the Nationalist Party
and Adolf Hitlerare fighting.

132
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,159
Itwarms me to hearone of the few
whose ideals are intact.

133
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,030
<i>I didn't know women played such
a large role in National Socialism.</i>

134
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,154
They play an immense role.

135
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,358
60 percent of all German women
support the Fuhrer.

136
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,556
- 60 percent, maybe more.
- That many?

137
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,230
Maybe more.

138
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,318
Excuse me,
butwhat is yourname?

139
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,034
Hamsun. Marie Hamsun.

140
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,598
- Related to the Nobel Prize winner?
- Hiswife.

141
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,159
Interesting.

142
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,558
- Maybe we could talk?
- Talk with me? Why?

143
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,955
- Itwas nice to meet you.
- Yes...

144
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,076
Interesting.

145
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,676
Beautiful.

146
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,913
The family
centered around the woman.

147
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,274
Women are the pillars of the society,
and society the pillarof... women.

148
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,828
Thiswaswhere Knut and I first met.
I was an actress then.

149
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,955
<i>Yes, it's heartwarming.
It makes one happy.</i>

150
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,549
Knutwanted it thatway.

151
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,231
Once again,
thank you formeeting me here.

152
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,637
I've sacrificed my life forthat.

153
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,517
If itwere pointless, my whole life
would be pointless, MrQuisling.

154
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,713
<i>It's by no means
a pointless sacrifice.</i>

155
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,359
<i>- To sacrifice one's life for...
- Forwhat?</i>

156
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,151
- Fora cause.
- A cause?

157
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,429
<i>The cause.</i>

158
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,553
When I heard you speak,
I realized -

159
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,154
<i>- there still are men whose ideals
are intact, who don't fail.</i>

160
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,717
- Thank you.
- Not all sacrifices are pointless.

161
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,597
Thank you.

162
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,190
I hope that you, forme, -

163
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,996
- are able to hold but a fraction
of the high regard we all have -

164
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,953
- foryourhusband.

165
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,237
You will be a model
forall Norwegian wives.

166
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,274
<i>- But I'm just Knut'swife.
- A model.</i>

167
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,712
That is the most important
of all parts.

168
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,275
Are we agreed, then?

169
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,712
You're coming home.
The carwill pick you up tomorrow.

170
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,037
Very well.

171
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,837
Have you written anything at all
during all this?

172
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,589
- I'll neverwrite anotherword.
- Good.

173
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,793
The worst part of all this is
that I've lost all respect foryou.

174
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,229
<i>Quisling didn't get many votes.
A pity, he's my man.</i>

175
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,876
He got a mere 26,000 votes.

176
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,995
- And only one from this region.
- Yes. Thatwas mine.

177
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,109
<i>And I'm proud of it.</i>

178
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,836
<i>I'm proud of it.</i>

179
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,714
<i>And so we present the award
for 1939-</i>

180
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,870
<i>- to the greatest poet of our tlme
and a true frlend of Germany.</i>

181
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,837
<i>Marie...
Marie, tell them I'm grateful.</i>

182
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,829
<i>Knut Hamsun thanks you for
the German Booksellers'Award.</i>

183
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,998
<i>Hls love for the German people, -</i>

184
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,320
<i>- German culture and
for Natlonal Soclallsm Is great.</i>

185
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,595
<i>It Is just as strong as hls hatred
for Brltlsh Imperlallsm.</i>

186
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,351
<i>He sends the German people
hls regards and hls thanks.</i>

187
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,596
What did you say? I just told you
to thank them. You went on and on.

188
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,669
<i>I told them you hated Britain
and loved Germany. Well, don't you?</i>

189
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,510
<i>- Don't you?
- Yes, damn it, but don't carry on.</i>

190
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,313
Mrs Hamsun, maybe you should be
a little more discreet.

191
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,037
- Discreet?
- Warmay break out.

192
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,153
He may be exploited.
He needs the best advisors.

193
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,558
<i>As his publisher, you must know
he won't take advice from anyone.</i>

194
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,753
- Maybe from you?
- Particularly not from me.

195
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,954
But you are his ear, orrather,
voice. I heard so just now.

196
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,516
<i>Aren't you contentwith
making money off us?</i>

197
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,517
<i>"Us"?</i>

198
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,679
<i>You must eat, Ellinor.
Have some of daddy's sugarloaf.</i>

199
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,112
Why do you starve yourself?
Come on, eat.

200
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,151
I beg you.

201
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,995
<i>- Look, I command you...
- I won't let you command me.</i>

202
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,432
You may have all the toadies
eating off yourprize-winning hand.

203
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,633
- But I won't, father.
- My dearlittle child.

204
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,911
<i>You nevershould've had children.
You couldn't stand ourcrying.</i>

205
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,318
It interfered with all the great
thoughts in yourgreat mind.

206
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,830
So you sent us away.
Away, away, away.

207
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,719
We were sent away to study
at awfully posh schools in France.

208
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,916
Away!

209
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,270
I'll eat as I please.

210
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,157
- Dearest Ellinor, I only wanted...
- We were nothing but a nuisance.

211
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,151
- Except forphotographswith you.
- I've always loved you.

212
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,670
In fact, more than...

213
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,510
No, but always.

214
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,029
You must eat something.

215
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,639
Father, the butter's all dirty.
I love you.

216
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,711
<i>But I won't eat.</i>

217
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,512
<i>- Where are you going?
- To Oslo. Don't you remember?</i>

218
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,396
Good morning.

219
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,799
The British
have mined the Vestfjord.

220
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,918
No.

221
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,114
- Ellinor, you're drunk!
- The British have mined the fjord.

222
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,551
Careful, Marie.
They might invade us.

223
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,673
- Rathera warthan yourbattles.
- We have fourchildren!

224
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,431
<i>Tore's exhibition is opening, and
though the two of you don't care...</i>

225
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,673
<i>You hearwhat you want to.
Tore's exhibition is opening.</i>

226
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,957
What is it that keeps going
without going anywhere?

227
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,239
You and yourclocks, father.

228
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,952
You know... Both you and I
would like time to stand still.

229
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,235
<i>My dear Marle...</i>

230
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,829
<i>Glve me your hands.</i>

231
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,952
<i>The hands of an angel, Marle.</i>

232
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,872
You have the same hands
as grandmother.

233
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,158
- Do you think about hera lot?
- Yes, my sunshine.

234
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,473
- Are you happy?
- Yes, almost happy.

235
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,911
- How will I get to Oslo?
- Walk to Nesodden and go by bus.

236
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,997
<i>There's a bus?</i>

237
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,556
<i>In view of the sltuatlon, It Is
the duty of the Natlonallsts -</i>

238
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,390
<i>- to take control of the government
and protect Norweglan Interests -</i>

239
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,398
<i>- and malntaln our Independence.</i>

240
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,230
<i>We alone, In virtue of the
natlonal goal of our movement, -</i>

241
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,275
<i>- can do thls and get our country
out of the desperate sltuatlon -</i>

242
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,268
- which ourpoliticians
have brought upon us.

243
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,514
We strongly urge all Norwegians
to remain calm and composed -

244
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,076
<i>- in this ourcountry's
most trying of times.</i>

245
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,192
<i>Only through
our common good wlll-</i>

246
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,235
<i>- can we get Norway through
thls crlsls as a free country.</i>

247
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,916
<i>In view of the present sltuatlon, -</i>

248
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,954
<i>- any further reslstance
wlll not only be polntless, -</i>

249
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,234
<i>- but wlll beregarded as crlmlnal
destructlon of property and Ilves.</i>

250
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,237
- What do you think he'll do?
- Quisling?

251
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,637
- Father.
- Play solitaire.

252
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,477
Maybe I should ask
what you are going to do.

253
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,797
<i>I'm glad they beat the English to it.</i>

254
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,790
<i>We Immedlately moved Inland,
where Norweglan troops, -</i>

255
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,472
<i>- Inclted by Brltlsh agents
and radlo, -</i>

256
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,434
<i>- were offerlng their asslstance.</i>

257
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,110
<i>It's simple.
You'll get three live rounds each, -</i>

258
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,596
- and then you will proceed
onto the truck.

259
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,836
Get out of here.

260
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,560
Three rounds, three Germans.

261
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,916
Get on the truck.

262
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,593
- Where are they going?
- Setesdal.

263
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,670
- What do you need a rifle for?
- Knut Hamsun? My mum knows you.

264
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,839
Are you Hamsun?

265
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,519
I've read some of yourbooks.

266
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,593
We'll defend yourbooks
against those bloody Nazi swine.

267
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,635
Hamsun, the soul of Norway.
The king said so himself!

268
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,638
Anything for Norway!

269
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,876
Norwegians...

270
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,992
Norwegians!

271
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,397
<i>In any klnd ofweather
we'll fight the enemy</i>

272
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,034
<i>fight for old Norway</i>

273

<i>Norweglansl When the Brltlsh,

<i>Some day, If not tomorrow,

287
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,795
"Norwegians! Lay down your rifles.
Go home. Germany fights for us all -

288
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,154
- and will crush the British tyranny
against us and neutral countries. "

289
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,268
Our honoured Nobel Prize winner
asks Norwegian soldiers-

290
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,677
- to lay down their arms
and desert.

291
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,954
It makes me sick.
How are we going to explain this?

292
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,873
Such an act has always
received the maximum punishment.

293
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,593
To think the Nazis have
such a magic flute at their disposal.

294
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,117
And we can't afford to lose it.

295
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,869
Oh yes, we will be forced to.

296
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,919
<i>It's a proper Ilttle tour.</i>

297
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,908
<i>I'll be readlng In 42 cltles.
Mostly In theatres.</i>

298
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,715
<i>Malnly to women,
but also to soldlers.</i>

299
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,230
<i>The Fuhrer says that klnd of
moral support Is very Important.</i>

300
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,750
<i>I'll read from
"The Growth of the Soll".</i>

301
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,919
<i>Wlth regards from Knut Hamsun,
of course.</i>

302
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,270
<i>I plan to end each readlng...</i>

<i>Won't he be readlng?</i>

305
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,468
<i>The most pro-German
Nobel Rrlze wlnner allve, -</i>

306
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,956
<i>- the great genlus,
doesn't speak German.</i>

307
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,393
<i>- Won't he at least be present?
- No, he hasn't the strength.</i>

308
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,398
<i>He wants me to be hls volce.</i>

309
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,071
<i>Furthermore, he Is so deaf
that I have to be hls ear, too.</i>

310
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,669
<i>It's not exactly easy.</i>

311
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,953
He's sunk three British ships.

312
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,358
<i>I asked if they were battleships,
and he replied, "Ja. Naturllch. "</i>

313
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,396
Why do you hate Britain so?

314
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,910
The imperialism.
The industrialism.

315
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,159
The hunger blockade against
our country, against the children!

316
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,275
Mass murders in India.
Concentration camps in South Africa.

317
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,552
- Culture...
- One word!

318
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,630
The arrogance!

319
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,791
I thought Norway was to take
a prominent place in the new Europe.

320
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,390
That free Norwegians would lead...

321
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,476
"Thought"?
Don't you think so anymore?

322
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,714
Why don't you join them?

323
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,354
Why don't you join them?

324
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,678
I dreamt about you last night.

325
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,475
I flew up high...
It was like in the old days.

326
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,959
I flew up high like an albatross,
and then I saw you on the ground.

327
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,154
You looked like a little finch
with a broken wing.

328
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,195
I wanted to land,
but my wings refused. They flew on.

329
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,678
I couldn't land.
I could feel yourfear...

330
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,389
<i>Hamsun, Hamsun, Hamsun...</i>

331
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,797
<i>Mr Grleg...</i>

332
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,830
<i>...a gold mlne, I bet?</i>

333
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,079
<i>- He used to be.
- Yes, he used to be.</i>

334
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,477
<i>- And hls wlfe?
- She's In Germany.</i>

335
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,629
<i>And the next stop for you,
Mr Grleg, Is Grlnl.</i>

336
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,439
<i>Gentlemen, the Intellectual
reslstance men -</i>

337
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,236
<i>- we've sent to Grlnl are
avowed enemles of the new Germany.</i>

338
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,150
The intellectuals at Grini
are enemies of the new Germany.

339
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,396
<i>Rlease slt down.</i>

340
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,073
<i>- Do you know what they call me?
- They call me names.</i>

341
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,432
<i>- "Bloodhound"and the Ilke.
- "Bloodhound" and so on.</i>

342
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,873
Yourtreatment of Ronald Fangen
harms Germany's cause in Norway.

343
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,594
And now Harald Grieg!

344
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,952
<i>The Ronald Fangen case
harms Germany's reputatlon...</i>

345
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,312
I don't agree with them, but...

346
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,116
<i>They don't thlnk
the Fuhrer Is a great man.</i>

347
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,518
Neither of these two think
the Fuhrer is a great man.

348
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,754
<i>Contrary to you.</i>

349
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,669
I don't judge
the greatness of a man -

350
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,236
- by the size of the movement
he has created.

351
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,072
<i>A man's greatness has nothlng to do
wlth the slze of hls followlng.</i>

352
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,196
I judge it by the taste
it leaves in my mouth.

353
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,632
To be a great man
is to teach them about power, -

354
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,276
- all these imbeciles,
these supermen with power.

355
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,994
Caiaphas. Pilate. The emperor.

356
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,478
<i>A great man Is one who can teach
the Imbeclles what power Is, -</i>

357
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,831
<i>- the supermen wlth power.
Calaphas...</i>

358
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,476
I'm no democrat,
Herr Reichskommissar...

359
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,753
You can make the mob so vast
that it will seize control.

360
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,516
Hand them a butcher's knife
and let them rip and kill and win.

361
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,393
Whip them
into winning an election.

362
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,752
Winning intellectually,
or leading the world forward, -

363
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,159
- are things the mob cannot do.
Supermen can lead the mob.

364
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,158
Great minds don't ride horses.

365
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,158
Why aren't you translating?

366
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,797
<i>- I don't need any translatlon.
- He doesn't need a translation.</i>

367
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,397
<i>A great artlst
needs no translatlon.</i>

368
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,913
<i>He's slmply there.</i>

369
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,113
<i>You are a great artlst,
Herr Hamsun.</i>

370
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,711
<i>That Is why we love you.
The Fuhrer sends hls regards.</i>

371
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,434
<i>- I don't want to be photographed.
- That'll do.</i>

372
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,796
Do you think he realizes
he's being used?

373
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,076
The great master.

374
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,398
Submissively bowing down
before the German executioner.

375
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,153
Thank you for your letter.

376
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,317
It's hard to find your way
around here.

377
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,270
What's the news on Harald Grieg?

378
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,870
I'm afraid it's out of my hands...

379
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,278
- Speak up! I'm hard of hearing.
- Terboven...

380
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,392
You have to talk to Terboven.

381
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,556
Only he can do something
about it. Terboven.

382
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,469
He's not my man. But you are.

383
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,874
I thought you were
head of the government, Mr Quisling.

384
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,154
Yes. Finally, we can
form a Norwegian government.

385
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,874
Thanks to the Fuhrer.

386
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,232
The Fuhrer asked me to send you
his regards. He thanks you.

387
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,956
- Thanks me? For what?
- For having mentioned the Jews.

388
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,950
<i>"Roosevelt Is a Jew... "</i>

389
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,958
Jew... Roosevelt.

390
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,995
"... paid by the Jews, the driving
force behind the American war, -

391
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,911
- over gold and Jewish power. "
We've waited for your outspokenness.

392
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,875
I'm not an anti-Semite. And I don't
understand Hitler's anti-Semitism.

393
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,870
- I don't understand him.
- Haven't you read "Mein Kampf"?

394
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,595
No, I never got around to it.

395
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,917
But I've read the reviews.

396
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,554
But what you write is true.

397
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,550
And you do believe the Norwegian race
to be the same as the German.

398
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,990
- Race, that is.
- People.

399
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,832
Race.

400
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,993
Anyway, the Fuhrerthanks you.

401
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,193
We're reviving the old constitution
which bans Jews from Norway.

402
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,916
A Jew is an oriental,
and he doesn't belong in Europe.

403
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,033
- What will you do with them?
- They will...

404
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,276
- They will be re-educated.
- What?

405
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,395
It's just a word. As a poet you have
a better way with words than I.

406
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,310
You are a master of words,
and that gives you power.

407
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,557
What do you mean?

408
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,914
I mean that the Fuhrerthanks you
forthose words.

409
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,395
<i>"Inger swarmed, too. "</i>

410
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,752
<i>"She was hardly anyone
among men. "</i>

411
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,748
<i>"Only one. "</i>

412
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,758
<i>"And now It Is nlght. "</i>

413
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,638
<i>Flnally, I'd Ilke to glve you
my husband's klnd regards.</i>

414
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:54,118
<i>The poet Knut Hamsun wlshes
wlth all of hls heart-</i>

415
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,357
<i>- that Germany wlll be vlctorlous.</i>

416
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,909
<i>But he also wlshes
that Norway wlll be free agaln.</i>

417
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,157
<i>Mrs Hamsun, your contrlbutlon
to the war effort-</i>

418
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,033
<i>- Is very pralseworthy.</i>

419
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,360
<i>Your readlng of"The Growth
of the Soll"has moved us deeply.</i>

420
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,032
<i>The Wehrmacht copy Is our soldlers'
most prlzed possesslon.</i>

421
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,792
<i>And thus art, great poetry,
alds us In our struggle.</i>

422
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,798
<i>Mrs Hamsun, would you?</i>

423
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,954
<i>It belongs to my son.
He loves to read It.</i>

424
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,908
You know I want my porridge
so the spoon will stand upright.

425
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,159
Upright, by itself.
What are you bawling about?

426
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,875
Well, you see, Mr Hamsun...

427
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,073
Mette's brother in Grimstad...

428
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,352
He was with the Resistance.

429
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,951
Now Terboven is going to have
them shot. There were 13 of them.

430
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,554
Two from Grimstad.

431
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,790
Don't cry, my dear.
You mustn't cry.

432
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,956
Oh well, a couple of lice
more or less makes no difference.

433
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,038
Mr Hamsun...

434
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,189
Do you recall you stayed at
our hotel while you were writing?

435
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,595
What do you want?

436
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,510
You have to intercede for Esben,
forthem all, with Terboven.

437
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,716
The Germans trust you.
The boys are going to be shot.

438
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,712
- Have you seen my father?
- Not since he left for his stroll.

439
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,630
They've tortured him.
Burnt the soles of his feet.

440
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,991
Torn out his finger nails!

441
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,751
Intercede for him, Mr Hamsun.
They've tortured him.

442
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,112
He's only 20,
and now he's going to die!

443
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,117
Be quiet!

444
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,995
You're a Nazi.
It said so in the paper.

445
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,512
- Please ask Terboven...
- I can't do that.

446
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,714
They don't listen to me.
I keep sending them telegrams.

447
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,993
- Stop begging me.
- Don't you understand?

448
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,034
Dear, kind Mr Hamsun.
He's going to die.

449
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,359
You pig!
You dirty German pig!

450
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,431
What's his name?

451
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,392
You can't sit there, father.

452
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,475
I just want to die in peace.

453
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,593
But they throw themselves at me,
screaming and yelling.

454
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,634
Come on, let's go home.

455
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,159
- Did you know Esben?
- Which Esben?

456
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,636
Esben Brodersen, 12 Solvgate.

457
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,593
Are you in distress, father?
Is it really bad?

458
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,039
I just wanted to die in peace
when all this started.

459
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,630
Well, you can't,
so you'll have to live with it.

460
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,796
What am I to do?

461
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,033
It's too late to ask my advice.

462
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,389
- It's too late, father.
- What is it?

463
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,993
"Idealism isn't just an armchair
occupation," to quote mother.

464
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,429
Are you out of your mind?
What good will it do?

465
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,790
You're going to enlist?

466
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,118
The Eastern Front? You don't even
know what a rifle looks like.

467
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:13,193
What will you do? Write poems?
Have you thought this through?

468
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,838
Who put this insane idea
into your head? Mother?

469
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,273
Father?

470
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,637
- Don't worry about it.
- But it's absurd.

471
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,515
You can't possibly have
come up with this yourself.

472
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,436
Absurd.

473
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,711
Arild, you're a...
poet by nature.

474
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,879
It's absurd.
What is happening to ourfamily?

475
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,709
- Everything's in ruins.
- I came here to...

476
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,310
- Another plea for mercy?
- What of it?

477
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,548
You do think the idiots deserve a
beating, at least, if not being shot.

478
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,069
- Don't you?
- Go.

479
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,354
Well, no one's been pardoned yet.
Maybe it'd help if I wrote.

480
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,279
Maybe Terboven likes me better.

481
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,519
You couldn't be bothered.
You're fartoo busy in Germany.

482
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,036
When I think about
how happy we used to be...

483
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,310
How did we end like this?

484
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,752
Please go, Marie. Haven't we
tormented each other enough?

485
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,432
Father?

486
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,868
I'm leaving in a week.

487
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,438
I'm training at Lichtenfelde West,
and then on to the Eastern Front.

488
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,317
- This is her doing.
- No, I'm following my conscience.

489
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,753
But you're going to be an author.
What do you want a rifle for?

490
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,875
You're the one always praising the
Norwegian lads fighting Bolshevism.

491
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,835
He's not an armchair philosopher.
He's true to his ideals.

492
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,636
- You should respect that.
- They are yourideals.

493
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,195
This was my own decision!

494
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,919
I'm glad to see you're worried.
You never have been before.

495
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,714
So maybe it's about time.

496
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,510
I take your writings seriously.
It matters a lot to me.

497
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,995
- But what good will it do?
- It's all forthe cause.

498
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,670
The fight against Bolshevism.
My conscience!

499
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,236
- You talked him into this.
- It's his own choice.

500
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,274
I've given hundreds of lectures
about the sacrifice.

501
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,678
Women must be brave and send their
sons off to fight the Bolsheviks.

502
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,351
I tell them not to think about
how long their son will live, -

503
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,836
- but whether he'll achieve
anything in his life.

504
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,192
<i>"Could you send yours off?" they ask.
"No, it would break my heart. "</i>

505
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,359
But the boys make up their own minds.
It's their own affair.

506
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,949
"Their own affair"?

507
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,714
I get letters begging me to
intercede forthe condemned boys.

508
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,914
They're pro-British, but that's their
own affair. It's their decision.

509
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,672
But to have a handful of our boys
slaughtered, what good will it do?

510
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,236
Write it down, dear Knut.
You are a master of words.

511
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,000
But, Arild...

512
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,312
Arild...

513
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,428
Go on, write about it. About
sacrificing your life for something.

514
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,555
About sacrificing yourself for
somebody else. I'm sure you can.

515
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,990
About the sacrifice!

516
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,152
"This is addressed to
the pro-British. "

517
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,512
"One would think
they had more sense in their heads. "

518
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,992
"They want to help Britain.
Fine. That's their own affair. "

519
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,395
Their own affair...

520
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,151
"But they won't help Britain
by getting themselves killed. "

521
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,716
"They believe Britain will win.
Very well. "

522
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,357
"But then why do they risk
their own lives?"

523
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,792
- Dinner's served.
- Thank you. After you.

524
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,156
- He writes well.
- He's written to Terboven, too.

525
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,834
Maliciously and well.

526
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,631
These resistance people
believe Britain will win.

527
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,197
<i>They wantthem to win.
Sooner or later.</i>

528
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,318
Well, that's their own affair.

529
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,597
But do you think
Britain will win?

530
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,118
If so, both Vidkun Quisling
and Knut Hamsun -

531
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,996
- are headed forthe scaffold
as traitors.

532
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,274
I apologize for my wife.
She's Russian, and she's afraid.

533
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,353
She can't sleep at night.

534
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,632
She isn't strong by nature.

535
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:19,039
It's more in her nature to worry...
for me.

536
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,075
She's not as strong as you,
Mrs Hamsun. Not at all.

537
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,916
You have great strength.
You have no doubts.

538
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,672
- No.
- You are incredibly strong.

539
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,194
Incredibly strong.

540
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,315
I've been very afraid in my life.
But that was then.

541
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,715
Then came the cause.

542
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,069
But I do remember
what it was like to be afraid.

543
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,669
But now? No.

544
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,520
You're going to...
meet with Terboven?

545
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,633
Grieg is at Grini.
Rumour has it he's quite ill.

546
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,789
- Knut wants me to intercede for him.
- Why doesn't he do it himself?

547
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,154
Terboven doesn't like him much.
They agree about the end.

548
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,710
- But not about the means.
- I see.

549
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,273
But I'll get Grieg out.

550
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,510
And then I'll tell him. He'll never
forgive me for saving him.

551
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,236
He once said my books were so
well written, Knut must've helped.

552
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,757
You have strong passions,
Mrs Hamsun. Cheers.

553
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,195
Strong passions.

554
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,117
I swear by almighty God...

555
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,757
...that I,
in the battle against Bolshevism...

556
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:12,435
...will pledge allegiance...

557
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,510
...to the German army's warlord,
Adolf Hitler.

558
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:26,035
And as a brave soldier,
I will be at all times ready...

559
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,509
...to put my life at risk
forthis pledge.

560

<i>"For three years now,

Fire.

591
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,878
I particularly asked him to have
mercy on the two from Grimstad.

592
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,798
He must go.

593
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,879
He's drowning Norway in blood.

594
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,593
"Herr Hitler, you know I admire you. "

595
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,590
"And I believe in your dream
about a great, new Europe -

596
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,270
- in which a free Norway
in the far north -

597
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,917
- will take an honourable
and prominent place at the table. "

598
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,477
"But the sceptics say
Norway will be a protectorate -

599
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,638
- under German rule.
What am I to say?"

600
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,960
"Herr Hamsun, I assure you
that my dream is the same... "

"Herr Hitler, I do not doubt
your dream of a new Europe. "

"But you're a mortal, too.
When you're gone, -

603
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,998
- will Norway then be guaranteed
constitutional rights-

604
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,873
- ensuring our independence?"

605
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,753
"Herr Hamsun, why do you persist
in this legal quibbling?"

"Herr Hitler, I agitated for
a free Norway in 1905."

607
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,474
"You were hardly even born then!"
No, I can't say that.

608
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,071
- What on earth are you doing?
- Go away. I'm rehearsing.

609
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:09,354
- Aren't I going with you to Hitler?
- That's out of the question!

610
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,470
There's talk of a historic meeting
like that of Goethe and Napoleon.

611
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,190
They say you're meeting Adolf Hitler.
Can you confirm this rumour?

612
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,996
I'm going to Vienna to speak
at a journalists' conference.

620
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,835
<i>He wrote books
untll he became too weary.</i>

621
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:02,753
<i>And all he can ask for now
Is benevolence. He's too old.</i>

627
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,357
<i>Germany, however, Is alone -</i>

01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,393
<i>Watzmann. Hohe Goll.
Klrchsteln.</i>

647
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,636
<i>Tea Is served.</i>

648
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,990
<i>I'm a great admlrer of yours,
Herr Hamsun.</i>

649
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:25,150
<i>I feel we are klndred splrlts. My
Ilfe resembles yours In many ways.</i>

650
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,908
<i>I've always taken a great Interest
In artlsts, -</i>

651
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,795
<i>- In how you turn
your experlences Into art.</i>

652
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,278
Herr Hitler admires you
and is very interested in artists...

653
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,952
I admire you, Herr Hitler. I believe
in your dream of a new Europe.

654
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:48,233
<i>Herr Hamsun admlres you
and belleves In your dream.</i>

655
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:54,197
<i>Tell me, how dld you go about
wrltlng "The Growth of the Soll"?</i>

656
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,312
<i>Do you wrlte at dawn
or at nlght?</i>

657
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,674
<i>The dally rhythm of a poet
and a polltlclan Is slmllar...</i>

658
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,237
Reichskommissar Terboven
has no understanding of us.

659
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:13,151
He says we can do our shipping
in the Baltic or on our lakes.

660
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,990
Norway, the third largest
seafaring nation in the world!

661
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,670
Well now, who's this?
Look.

662
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,395
<i>Thls Is Albert Speer's
Ilttle daughter.</i>

663
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,148
What a pretty little doll.

664
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,671
<i>Come back later. Your mother
wlll be looklng for you.</i>

665
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:43,991
<i>Herr Hamsun sald that Terboven
wants us to sall on the lakes.</i>

666
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:49,991
<i>Unfortunately, war puts
an end to all overseas shlpplng.</i>

667
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,474
Unfortunately, war puts an end to
all overseas shipping.

668
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,750
But in the future.

669
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,717
Norway is to take an honourable
place in the new Europe. You said so.

670
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:10,552
But Terboven has said repeatedly
that Norway will cease to exist.

671
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:15,470
<i>Terboven says there won't be
a Norway In the future.</i>

672
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:20,595
No Norway. We'll be reduced
to a German province.

673
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,155
<i>We'll be a German provlnce.</i>

674
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,239
<i>Contrary to other countrles,
you have your own government.</i>

675
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,672
- Norway has her own government.
- But it carries no weight.

676
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:37,193
<i>Terboven has the final say.
But what happens afterthe war?</i>

677
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,795
<i>The Norweglan people
are very monarchlst.</i>

678
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,393
<i>One must destroy
the klng's great popularlty.</i>

679
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,397
<i>No commentsl</i>

680
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,037
His methods are foreign to us.
His Prussian ways are intolerable.

681
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,313
And the executions!
We've had enough.

682
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:05,116
<i>The Relchskommlssar's methods
do not sult us.</i>

683
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:11,316
Two innocent men will be shot
unless they turn another man in.

684
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:17,834
Tell me, would a German betray
a friend if his life were threatened?

685
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,918
This terror, this bloodbath!

686
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,680
Terboven has no easy job.

687
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,590
He has many difficult tasks
to carry out.

688
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,917
<i>There Is no room for emotlons.</i>

689
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:38,150
- Terboven has many tasks...
- But will he ever be recalled?

690
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:43,229
Will Norway end up a protectorate?
Will Norway ever be free?

691
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,479
<i>WIII Terboven ever be recalled?</i>

692
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:55,710
He is a man of war. He deals only
with matters of war in Norway.

693
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,471
Afterthe war he will return to Essen
to his old job as Gauleiter.

694
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,116
<i>After the war
he'll return to Essen.</i>

695
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:09,313
We aren't against the occupation.
No doubt we need it, -

696
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,593
- but this man will ruin more for us
than you can ever build!

697
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,236
<i>Hush now,
he's glven us hls word.</i>

698
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:22,958
Why must we live with
this uncertainty about the future?

699
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,312
And Sweden. We want to remain
on good terms with Sweden.

700
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,478
But Sweden is turning against us.

701
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:35,037
Forget Sweden.
We're here on behalf of Norway.

702
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:39,597
<i>Germany dldn't have to Install
a Norweglan government.</i>

703
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,792
Germany didn't have to install...

704
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,151
<i>It was merely
a slgn of our goodwlll.</i>

705
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:50,592
It's like talking to the wall.
We believe in you, Herr Hitler, -

706
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,314
- but your will is twisted.

707
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,311
Your procedure in Norway is wrong.
It will only lead to a new war!

708
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,115
<i>Oh, be quletl
You don't understand anythlng.</i>

709
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,709
What's going on?

710
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,992
Tell him that we believe in him.

711
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,591
<i>- Mr Hamsun says we belleve In you.
- Get hlm to calm down.</i>

712
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,118
<i>Send hlm away. I never want to see
a man Ilke hlm agaln.</i>

713
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,835
What?

714
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:33,032
<i>- Thls way, Herr Hamsun.
- What? Am I leaving?</i>

715
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,320
Is he throwing me out?

716
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:18,148
<i>"She was hardly anyone
among men. "</i>

717
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,554
<i>"Only one. "</i>

718
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,797
<i>"And now It Is nlght. "</i>

719
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,511
<i>- What about next wlnter?
- Then I'll be back.</i>

720
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,235
<i>Do you really thlnk
there'll stlll be a Germany?</i>

721
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,437
<i>I flrmly belleve In vlctory
for Germany and the Fuhrer.</i>

722
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,198
<i>If only some of your bellef
could rub off on us.</i>

723
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,517
<i>We're beglnnlng to have doubts.</i>

724
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:12,430
<i>For your sake, I'll forget I ever
heard you utter those words.</i>

725
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,431
Now...

726
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,517
Now, Knut.

727
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,638
At last.

728
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,431
You haven't told me about
new German victories for some time.

729
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,351
How are things?

730
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,676
Hitler is dead.

731
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,673
I'd better write an obituary.

732
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,959
Don't. Germany is going to surrender
in a few days.

733
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,515
It'll all be over soon.

734
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,835
Then I'll be the only one
wanting to write him an obituary.

735
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,877
<i>Hell Hltler.</i>

736
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,076
<i>Hell Hltler.</i>

737
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:23,472
"Far be it for me
to talk about Adolf Hitler. "

738
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:29,357
"Neither his life nor deeds
invite any form of sentimentalism. "

739
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:35,153
"He was a warrior,
a warriorfor mankind. "

740
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:40,354
"He preached the gospel
that all countries had rights. "

741
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,348
"He was a reformer
of the first water. "

742
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,199
"It was his historic destiny-

743
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,518
- to work in a time
of extreme brutality-

744
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,917
- which eventually destroyed him. "

745
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,557
"That is how Western Europe
should look upon Adolf Hitler. "

746
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,991
"And we, his closest supporters, -

747
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:09,196
- bow our heads over his death.
Knut Hamsun. "

748
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,758
They'll be here for me, too, soon.

749
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,110
I'll pack my bags.

750
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,311
Thank you.

751
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,079
You shake the hand of a traitor?

752
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:46,398
We won't be as barbarian
as they were. So I decided I would.

753
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,111
We'll see.

754
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:56,235
- Yes... we'll see.
- Father...

755
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,397
Good morning.

756
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:37,438
I haven't killed anyone,
or stolen anything.

757
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,478
Nor have I set fire to anything.

758
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,549
Do you admit to
having written these articles?

759
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,275
- Did you write these articles?
- Yes, I did.

760
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,313
Then please sign... here.

761
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,833
The tax man says you must have
more money than you've stated.

762
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:40,113
25,000 in cash, 100 shares
in Gyldendal and Norholm farm.

763
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,916
That's a mighty fine bicycle
you have there, Mr Christensen.

764
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:51,952
- It's a Crescent.
- I'd have liked one like that.

765
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,710
It's been a long time.

766
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,434
Don't say anything. I know.

767
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:00,752
I can't get hold of
any more liquor. I'm in a bad state.

768
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,837
Have you got any?

769
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,909
Dear, sweet Cecilia, if you have any,
please give it to me.

770
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,155
It was forfather.

771
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,352
Thank you.

772
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,793
I haven't been here forten years.

773
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,389
Has it changed much?

774
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:02,714
How are our loved ones?
I know Arild is in jail.

775
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:07,516
And Tore has been fined...
Is he in jail, too?

776
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,679
He was at Grini.
He sent me a letter.

777
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:16,590
He wrote he was digging up
executed Russian POWs. It stank.

778
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,395
- What about the rest?
- Mother got three years.

779
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,556
I went to see her yesterday.
It was awful.

780
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,668
And father's in a rest home.

781
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,477
He wants to be tried
and sentenced.

782
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:51,398
They'll never allow it.
They want him to wither and die.

783
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,398
They must think it too embarrassing.

784
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,673
He'll die in hell only.
He'll never give in.

785
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,436
What a family.

786
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:17,398
- What a wonderful family.
- Yes.

787
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,312
I'm going to visit fathertomorrow.

788
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,150
It's forfather!

789
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,476
Will you come with me?

790
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:49,634
Tell him from me... He shouldn't
have been an albatross.

791
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,959
He should've come down to us.

792
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,199
Tell the bastard...

793
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,192
No, don't.

794
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,074
Please don't, Cecilia.

795
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,917
Don't say it.

796
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,071
Just say hello to father.

797
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,919
Say hello from Ellinor.

798
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:01,518
- What have they done to you?
- I'm waiting, you see.

799
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:06,510
I'm being subjected to a mental
examination. To see if I'm mad.

800
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,440
In a week, I'll be at the asylum.

801
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:15,430
You must travel and see the world
even if you're old.

802
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,119
Ellinor sends her love.

803
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:23,437
How is she?

804
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,072
I see.

805
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,432
- What are you doing?
- Writing.

806
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,670
- It's really only words.
- Words?

807
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:48,032
I haven't written any words
for 15 years.

808
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,199
16, no...
So now I'm starting all over again.

809
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,397
- Father...
- One must write again.

810
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:03,037
Walk down the old,
overgrown paths.

811
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:07,993
Well, anyway...
Then I'll be happy.

812
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,834
- So, this is the madhouse.
- The psychiatric clinic.

813
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,873
It looks like Norholm
made of stone.

814
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,914
The doctor's note.
The doctor's note!

815
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:47,511
But I'm not ill. I'm the healthiest
person everto enterthis hospital.

816
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,429
- It's just that I'm deaf.
- Your glasses.

817
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:55,030
- But then I can't read.
- Your glasses.

818
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,959
You'll get them back tomorrow.

819
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:06,553
I've been sitting on that train
for 12 hours.

820
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:13,429
I want to sleep.
And I haven't had a thing to eat.

821
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,071
I hardly got time
to put on my trousers.

822
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,558
Sit down.

823
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:58,952
We will begin ourtalks now.
We'll make a thorough examination.

824
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,233
You are an interesting man.

825
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,477
Poets are extraordinary people.

826
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,632
Please write your name here.

827
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,717
Your name.

828
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,678
I started shaking 30 years ago.

829
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,512
I've written thick books
with this hand.

830
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:37,189
It will be interesting to explore
the anatomy of a poet's soul.

831
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,950
Will it take long?

832
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,037
Yes, it will take a very long time.

833
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,277
Shall we begin?

834
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,436
Yes.

835
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,108
Very well, let's begin.

836
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,674
What is eleven times twelve?

837
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,513
Eleven times twelve, Mr Hamsun.

838
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,559
I never was good at arithmetic.

839
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,753
It once cost me 5,000 crowns.

840
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,236
But then,
it earned me 1,000 anothertime.

841
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:21,116
And I even worked in a shop
as a young man.

842
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,959
We'll do something simpler.

843
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:28,795
How much is seven times nine?

844
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,475
Seven times nine.

845
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,799
63.

846
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,795
I know you hear prayers.

847
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,953
If only I could get an answer.

848
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,072
I know you hear prayers...

849
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,470
...Lord.

850
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,070
- Good night.
- If only I could get an answer.

851
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,474
I know you hear prayers.

852
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:15,315
Answer me.
If only I could get an answer.

853
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:43,913
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee.
Make his face shine upon thee. "

854
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,076
I am innocent.

855
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,472
Fire!

856
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,955
I met him only once.

857
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,230
But I trusted him.

858
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:23,594
Maybe I was fooled,
but that can't be helped now.

859
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:28,151
He shouldn't have
treated the Jews like that.

860
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:32,911
We benefit from Jewish integration.
We, as well as other people.

861
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,793
He shouldn't have done that.

862
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:41,233
They ought to shoot me as well.
I'm not afraid of dying.

863
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:46,792
They might as well.
This is taking up a lot of time.

864
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,394
We've been at it for a month.
It's been torture.

865
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,991
I have to pass three locked doors
to get out into the open air.

866
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:02,398
And then back again
through the same locked doors.

867
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:08,438
Time is running out. How will I
ever get to serve my sentence?

868
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:13,316
Will you tell me about
your relationship to your wife?

869
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,558
Who?

870
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,114
- Your wife.
- No!

871
01:45:55,040 --> 01:46:00,478
As for your description of yourself,
have you got anything to add?

872
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:07,199
I've written about
hundreds of people, Mr Langfeldt.

873
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,397
I have a bit of each in me.

874
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,954
Yes? Of each of them?

875
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,075
We have many faces,
Mr Langfeldt.

876
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:29,717
Do you repent? You write here
that you disavow Nazism. You...

877
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:35,040
I'm not trying to excuse myself.
I did what I did.

878
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:40,030
Yes, you keep on saying that.
Do you feel you've been deceived?

879
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,954
A man doesn't make excuses.
Am I speaking too loud?

880
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:51,753
The questions about your marriage,
your wife...

881
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,679
You've simply ignored those.

882
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,788
Won't you talk about
your relationship to your wife?

883
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,310
We literally haven't
talked for years.

884
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,193
I wouldn't dream of
discussing her.

885
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:16,191
I'd scream with fear at the thought
of involving her behind her back.

886
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,391
With fear?

887
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,431
With fear...

888
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,115
It's a unique case.

889
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,950
A great poet gone astray who's
brought disaster on himself.

890
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:37,870
His spiritual life, his soul,
why he writes as he does.

891
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:43,716
What is a poet's inner motor?
What is the machinery of art-

892
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,590
- in times of crisis?

893
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,510
This is a unique opportunity for me
as a scientist and psychiatrist.

894
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:57,475
The circumstances are unique.
His marriage, his sex life.

895
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,830
Maybe that's the key.

896
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:05,279
In a hundred years,
literary researchers will thank me.

897
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:10,196
I've requested a house search.

898
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:15,633
And I intend to find a witness.
The most important one.

899
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,951
<i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

900
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,189
Mrs Hamsun, come with me.

901
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:59,477
You don't have to tell me anything.
But I would be grateful.

902
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:03,719
You know you can help him
by telling me everything.

903
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:09,278
- Who'll read my testimony?
- No one but the State attorney.

904
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:14,234
- If my husband finds out...
- You can rest assured.

905
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,709
- Where shall we start?
- I don't know.

906
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:26,032
Do you remember his first stroke?

907
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,151
Is it in here?

908
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:32,554
Are you going to
show me a movie?

909
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:36,150
The last movie I saw
was the one -

910
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,397
- that German woman
showed me in Vienna.

911
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:43,354
- But I don't suppose it's that one.
- No.

912
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,069
What on earth is this?

913
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:22,400
It's a so-called re-education camp
for Jews, Mr Hamsun.

914
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:30,275
The change came much earlier.
1936 or '35.

915
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,199
We had a terrible row...

916
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,350
I realized
he had abandoned his ideals.

917
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,271
Later he...
He didn't want to stay at home.

918
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:55,589
He rented a room at the inn in Oslo
and stayed away for a whole year.

919
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:04,357
He had stayed away before, but that
was when he was writing...

920
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,839
...his books.
His masterpieces, as they say.

921
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:14,033
Oh, he couldn't create them
in the environment...

922
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,596
The masterpieces suffered
in my presence.

923
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,315
And your relationship?

924
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:26,629
Since it changed...

925
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:33,557
...there hasn't been
any relationship.

926
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,233
Our confidence was lost.

927
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,317
<i>He started chaslng young glrls.
He was unfalthful to me.</i>

928
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:50,635
<i>He was unfalthful to me.
On several occaslons, Mr Langfeldt.</i>

929
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:56,352
<i>And he became so very aggresslve
towards me. Sald I wanted control.</i>

930
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,358
I tried to take control, he said.

931
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,518
Isn't that ridiculous? Control!

932
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:10,518
- Was he jealous?
- Only at first. It subsided.

933
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,838
Later on he stopped being jealous.

934
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,316
It was over.

935
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,638
Over...

936
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:25,998
Over.

937
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:29,559
I don't know what happened.

938
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,116
It just stopped.

939
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:38,359
During the war...
Was he very isolated?

940
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:42,676
I suppose you could say that.

941
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:48,318
He refused to listen to the radio.
He was deaf.

942
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:53,150
And the family only listened to
what was legal. Out of principle.

943
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:57,194
So he really doesn't understand
what he's done wrong.

944
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:06,677
<i>They say I made hlm pro-German.</i>

945
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:13,598
<i>As If he ever let me Influence hlm.</i>

946
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:18,191
<i>He had to hear It from others
before he belleved anythlng I sald.</i>

947
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:22,837
<i>Hls artlcles were
hls words excluslvely.</i>

948
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,679
<i>Oh, I got to type them up.</i>

949
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:29,919
I had, after all, written several
successful children's books.

950
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:33,999
So he let me type them up.
Which was a great honour.

951
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,715
He let me do that.

952
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:45,518
There were long periods of time
when he didn't utter a word.

953
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:49,474
He didn't talk to me.
He was wrapped up in hatred.

954
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:53,195
And I suppose
I returned that hatred.

955
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,670
It just wasn't fair.

956
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:04,358
<i>But hls mother...
He was very attached to her.</i>

957
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:12,073
She was blind in one eye.

958
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:15,909
A quiet, meek woman.

959
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:23,871
I think he looked for a woman like
that and thought he found her in me.

960
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:31,270
Already afterthe first year
he was terribly disappointed.

961
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:36,873
Never had he been so let down
by a woman. Let down!

962
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:41,236
I was wrong... Wrong!

963
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,349
But his mother...

964
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:49,031
He could go on for hours
about her endless sacrifices.

965
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:53,313
How she sacrificed everything
for her children.

966
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:00,908
But we had to send
our own children away.

967
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:03,031
<i>The glrls...</i>

968
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,879
<i>He blamed me.</i>

969
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:13,948
<i>He Inslsted the glrls be sent away
at the age of 14.</i>

970
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:19,668
<i>He blamed me for that, too.
For everythlngl</i>

971
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:23,710
The children...

972
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,716
The children.

973
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:50,155
- Why didn't you get a divorce?
- That's a good question.

974
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,273
We often talked about it.

975
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:58,678
I left him,
and he came to fetch me back.

976
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,996
And I went with him.

977
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:07,836
It was as if he drew a magic circle
around me when I was young.

978
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,872
I couldn't get out.

979
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:16,119
Every step I took,
or didn't take, -

980
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,754
- was decided by that circle.

981
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,996
Mrs Hamsun, -

982
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:26,512
- I have to ask you
about your marital relations.

983
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,752
His urges.

984
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:35,798
Yes?

985
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:41,399
Do I really have to answer?

986
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,310
Do I?

987
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:51,796
Mrs Hamsun,
you know you want to.

988
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,397
Get him to calm down
and bring him back in.

989
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,431
We've arranged for you
to visit your husband -

990
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:36,316
- to thank you for your co-operation.
He's waiting in the coffee room.

991
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:39,471
To thank me?

992
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:44,834
Wife? Do you mean my?
Is she here?

993
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,552
Why did you keep it from me, Marie?
Why didn't you say anything?

994
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:05,513
You should have said it all!

995
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:10,748
But I have said it all.
The truth, Knut.

996
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,679
What have you been up to?
Have you talked to him?

997
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:34,112
Have you bared your bleeding soul
to that little quack?

998
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:38,757
That bloody weasel?
Have you betrayed me, Marie?

999
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:44,837
I know. You are the...

1000
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,349
...most evil...

1001
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:51,155
...the most treacherous
and vile?

1002
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,238
At a loss for words, Knut?

1003
01:58:57,440 --> 01:59:00,193
You, the master of words.

1004
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,156
The most evil?

1005
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,198
I bid you farewell now, Marie.
We won't meet again.

1006
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,351
Will he live?

1007
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,553
It's up to me to save him.
He won't survive a trial.

1008
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,513
History will thank me.

1009
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:04,678
I can write an analysis
which will spare Hamsun a trial.

1010
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,953
But not until I know everything.

1011
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:14,078
- Langfeldt is through with him.
- What do you mean "through"?

1012
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:18,319
He's through with Hamsun.
It took four months.

1013
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:25,790
Thank God you're here.
He won't stop crying.

1014
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:31,114
The professor will hand in
his report next week.

1015
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:38,798
He's trying to deprive me
of my trial.

1016
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,639
He's going back to the rest home.

1017
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,877
He's going to pronounce me senile -

1018
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:51,153
- so I won't be able
to stand trial.

1019
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:59,712
I wasn't when I came here.
I wasn't...

1020
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:19,393
"1. It is not our opinion
that Knut Hamsun is insane. "

1021
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:23,593
"Nor was he insane when he committed
the acts in question. "

1022
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:27,713
"2. We believe him to have suffered
permanent mental damage, -

1023
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:32,232
- but do not think there's any risk
he will commit further crimes. "

1024
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:35,398
Well, that's reassuring.

1025
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:40,879
They say
there isn't any risk-

1026
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:44,550
- you'll "commit any further crimes".

1027
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,160
Somebody died last night.

1028
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:55,435
But it still wasn't me.

1029
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:59,269
I've written to the State.

1030
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:04,190
I insist on a trial for damages.
But they keep putting it off.

1031
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:08,712
- They're hoping you'll die.
- But I'm not dying.

1032
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,549
And no lawyer will take my case.

1033
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:15,911
I've got to read it all myself.

1034
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:22,070
- What's this?
- Mother's testimony.

1035
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:25,997
How was it?

1036
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:33,558
Courage is betterthan happiness.

1037
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:28,870
Your wife has been granted
leave from prison.

1038
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:32,834
Because your daughter needs help,
it says.

1039
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,838
Apparently,
your daughter is ill.

1040
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,476
- What are you writing?
- Writing?

1041
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,871
A novel?

1042
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:53,750
- Aren't you too old forthat?
- Indeed.

1043
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:58,192
It'll be a book
with permanent mental damage.

1044
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,909
But I want my trial first!

1045
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,360
- Mother!
- Ellinor!

1046
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:56,719
<i>"Dear Tore. God only knows
when I'll get my trlal. "</i>

1047
02:04:56,920 --> 02:05:01,789
<i>"I suppose they're puttlng It off
In the hope that I'll dle flrst. "</i>

1048
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:08,269
<i>"But my lawyer, Mrs Stray, trles
to put an end to thelr delays -</i>

1049
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,473
<i>- so we can get an exact date. "</i>

1050
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:18,232
<i>"In the meantlme, I just walt.
Father. "</i>

1051
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,195
No photographs!

1052
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:13,437
His articles boosted the faith of
the Germans in the Nationalist Party.

1053
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:19,150
Hamsun is to pay damages
for having supported the enemy...

1054
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:23,592
...responsible for his actions
during the war...

1055
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:27,873
...when the German forces
invaded Poland...

1056
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:30,640
...far more important is...

1057
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,593
I recommend he be judged harshly.

1058
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:37,998
The greaterthe man,
the greaterthe responsibility.

1059
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,959
Knut Hamsun, you may speak.

1060
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:12,119
This is my opportunity.

1061
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:19,032
I wish to unravel the list of my sins
properly and... morally correct.

1062
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:26,590
My articles speak forthemselves.
I won't try to diminish them.

1063
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:30,678
It's bad enough as it is.

1064
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:35,954
On the contrary, I stand by them.
Now as well as then.

1065
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:39,680
Just like I have always done.

1066
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:48,436
We were led to believe
that Norway would take -

1067
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:52,394
- a prominent place -

1068
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:58,630
- in the Greater German Empire
which was soon to be a reality.

1069
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,994
Everyone believed this,
more or less. Everyone.

1070
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:10,479
<i>I know I did. And that's why
I wrote the things I did.</i>

1071
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:19,756
I'm not saying this to defend myself.
I am not defending myself.

1072
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:24,869
I'm merely explaining my position.

1073
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,273
I value our reputation -

1074
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:43,828
- as well as our Norwegian
system of justice.

1075
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:51,469
But I value even more my own sense
of good and evil, of right and wrong.

1076
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:56,915
I'm old enough
to have my own guideline, -

1077
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:58,997
- and this was it.

1078
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:07,068
I felt the best way to serve
my country was to write what I did.

1079
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:11,910
To use my pen forthe good
of this new Norway, -

1080
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:17,274
- the most prominent among
the Germanic nations of Europe.

1081
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:20,916
The thought of this
appealed to me.

1082
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:25,350
Indeed, it made me ecstatic.

1083
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:30,998
Norway, an independent
and shining nation -

1084
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:35,557
- up there
on the outskirts of Europe.

1085
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:41,995
I wrote in orderto
persuade young Norwegians-

1086
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:48,036
- to refrain from doing stupid things
against the occupation forces.

1087
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:54,429
It wouldn't do them any good.
No, it would cost them their lives.

1088
02:09:54,640 --> 02:10:00,476
And I sent telegrams. There must be
an archive of my telegrams.

1089
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:05,629
I sent a lot. Time was running out,
so I sent telegrams night and day.

1090
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:09,879
My fellow countrymen's lives
were at stake.

1091
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:14,835
But this made the Germans
suspicious of me.

1092
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:20,273
They saw me as some sort of
untrustworthy mediator.

1093
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:24,996
Hitler wanted nothing to do with me.
Terboven didn't reply.

1094
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:29,033
Terboven got tired of me.

1095
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:36,510
And no one told me
what I was writing was wrong.

1096
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,836
No one in this country.

1097
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:45,229
I sat alone in my room.
I couldn't hear anything. I was deaf.

1098
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:49,159
No one could get through to me.

1099
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:55,353
They hammered on the stovepipe
to tell me dinner was served.

1100
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:58,396
I could hearthat.

1101
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:03,348
So I came down and ate.

1102
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:07,519
Then I went back to my room
and sat down.

1103
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:11,149
And I stayed there.

1104
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:19,511
All I had were my two newspapers:
Aftenposten and Fritt Folk.

1105
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:25,192
And none of those papers said I
was wrong. They thought I was right.

1106
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:33,951
But what I did went wrong.
It went wrong.

1107
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:41,795
I was floating in midair
with nothing to hang on to anymore.

1108
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,639
I brooded over everything.

1109
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:50,949
I reminded myself that every
great cultural figure we have -

1110
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:55,119
- had been through Germany-

1111
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:59,472
- and only then achieved
international greatness.

1112
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:04,390
I wasn't wrong in thinking that,
but I was criticized for it.

1113
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,388
It didn't lead me anywhere.
On the contrary, -

1114
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:12,798
- it lead everyone to believe
that I...

1115
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,516
...was betraying the very Norway
I so wanted to help.

1116
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:20,234
Well, so be it.

1117
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:26,591
It's my loss,
and I have to bear it.

1118
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,038
So, there I was...

1119
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:38,955
..."betraying" my country.

1120
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:42,072
I became a "traitor".

1121
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:49,719
So be it.
But I didn't feel like one, -

1122
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:55,278
- and I still don't.
I'm at peace with myself.

1123
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,314
I have always kept my country
in my soul, wherever I went.

1124
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:09,150
And that is where I intend
to keep my country, -

1125
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,476
- while I await...

1126
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:15,189
...my final sentence.

1127
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:26,069
I thank the court.

1128
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:30,558
This is all I wanted to say-

1129
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:34,719
- so as not to be dumb
as well as deaf.

1130
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,798
I felt I had to mention a few facts.

1131
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:44,317
The rest can wait
until some othertime.

1132
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:49,548
Until bettertimes
and another court than this.

1133
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,476
Tomorrow is another day,
and I have all the time in the world.

1134
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,513
Alive or dead,
it doesn't matter.

1135
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:02,793
It doesn't matterto the world
how one individual fares.

1136
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,310
In this case, me.
But I can wait.

1137
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:35,672
The defendant, Knut Hamsun,
born August 4, 1859, -

1138
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:38,348
- poet with a wife and children, -

1139
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:42,838
- is sentenced to pay
425,000 crowns in damages-

1140
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:46,555
- with an annual interest rate
at 4 per cent.

1141
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:52,116
Furthermore, he is sentenced to pay
the costs of the trial...

1142
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,630
Welcome back.

1143
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:41,435
I've been knitting socks now
for 2 years and 46 days.

1144
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,076
They probably think
they have enough socks now.

1145
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:50,155
I've prepared a lovely meal
for us at my place, mother.

1146
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:55,116
So father doesn't want me
to come home?

1147
02:15:57,760 --> 02:15:59,352
I knew it.

1148
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:04,272
We have a nice room for you
at home.

1149
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:09,318
<i>I've been longlng to ask you...</i>

1150
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:13,195
<i>You promlsed my testlmony
would be confldentlal, -</i>

1151
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:18,190
<i>- yet It's been sent to lawyers,
newspaper edltors. Everyonel</i>

1152
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:21,517
Mrs Hamsun, I couldn't prevent...

1153
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:24,996
You said only the State attorney
would see it.

1154
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,509
But it's everywhere now.

1155
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:32,191
Knut has read it, too.
You've ruined my life, and his.

1156
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:36,916
<i>- It was out of my hands.
- He's deprlved me of everythlng.</i>

1157
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:40,999
He's shut me out of Norholm.
And it's all yourfault.

1158
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,034
Knowing your relationship,
I hardly think it mattered.

1159
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:50,189
You know nothing
about human relationships!

1160
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:56,669
<i>- It happens to be my job.
- You made me a traitor. Bastard!</i>

1161
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:38,469
What are you doing, father?

1162
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:44,915
Oh, I'm just looking at myself.
You wouldn't understand.

1163
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:51,278
Father?

1164
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:55,633
Please let mother come home.

1165
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,868
"Please let mother come home"?
Is that what you came home to say?

1166
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:07,189
My dear, you don't understand.
I can't let anyone come home.

1167
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:16,031
I've told mother I never ever want
to live underthe same roof as her.

1168
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,549
Is that clear enough?

1169
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:22,639
I've even offered
to move into the rest home...

1170
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:28,715
It's not fair on mother,
you and Ellinor and the boys-

1171
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:34,153
- that I go on living. But it's not
such a lark for me, either.

1172
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:39,070
And now I'd just like to get
the book out before I die.

1173
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,032
"On Overgrown Paths".
Permanent mental damage.

1174
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:59,552
Yet he's managed to write
what is obviously a masterpiece.

1175
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,709
But we can't publish it.

1176
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:11,395
Public opinion, you see.
Norway would explode if a traitor...

1177
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:14,397
Well, you know.

1178
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:19,469
We were on different sides during
the war. I sincerely regret it.

1179
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:24,117
- Sincerely.
- Oh, please don't burst into tears.

1180
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:28,313
But Hamsun once brought
Gyldendal Publishers to Norway.

1181
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,397
You owe him.

1182
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:36,358
I hope Grini didn't leave its mark
on your body as well.

1183
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:40,553
You don't have to remind me...
I thank you.

1184
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:45,595
Don't thank me. Say you'll publish
a book you think is a masterpiece.

1185
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:50,271
- After his death.
- He wants it out now.

1186
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:52,630
After his death.

1187
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:58,277
Then he'll refuse to die.
He's already arranged it with God.

1188
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:02,268
- He says they agree.
- Try abroad.

1189
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:05,358
Being a confirmed
Norwegian patriot, -

1190
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:09,109
- the "traitor" would prefer
to have it published here.

1191
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:15,917
They want me
to cut certain parts.

1192
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:21,319
If only I'd cut out the shrink's
name, it would be out tomorrow.

1193
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,117
But I won't cut a single word!

1194
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:30,035
I beg your pardon?

1195
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:36,918
How can such a thin little book
pose a threat to anyone?

1196
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:14,749
ON OVERGROWN PATHS

1197
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:24,313
- Can it really be true?
- Yes, it's true, father.

1198
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,350
What do they think?

1199
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:35,190
The opinions differ
from "a masterpiece" -

1200
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:40,110
- to "an inexcusable deviance from
your permanent mental damage... "

1201
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:42,709
What does Marie think?

1202
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:51,270
I've asked you a question, Lord.

1203
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:55,996
You must answer me.
I've asked you so many times.

1204
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:03,036
I'm asking you
forthe last time, Lord:

1205
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:06,152
Should I? Should I?

1206
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,112
Should I?

1207
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,353
What's wrong, father?

1208
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:26,950
You must see to it
that mother comes home.

1209
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:30,277
Get mother home! Now!

1210
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,515
At one in the morning?

1211
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:44,951
You've been gone
for a long time, Marie.

1212
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:52,790
During all that time
I've had no one to talk to -

1213
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:56,312
- but God.

1214
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,389
<i>"Dear Cecllla. "</i>

1215
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:20,832
<i>"Father Is very happy that
I'm home. He says so every day. "</i>

1216
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:24,953
<i>"But he's dlfflcult.
He takes up most of my tlme. "</i>

1217
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:30,359
<i>"Send me some sleeplng pllls.
I daren't take any more morphlne. "</i>

1218
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:34,519
<i>"Nothlng has changed here.
We've no electrlclty, -</i>

1219
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:39,236
<i>- father sleeps nolslly, talklng to
God wlth thunder In hls volce. "</i>

1220
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,874
<i>"I can't get any sleep. "</i>

1221
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:46,710
<i>"I serve hlm junket wlth an egg
yolk and he loves coffee and cake. "</i>

1222
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:53,869
<i>"I've found the mlsslng letters
from 1908-9 when we flrst met. "</i>

1223
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:57,959
<i>"I reread them today
and felt qulte sad. "</i>

1224
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:05,271
<i>"I keep thlnklng of a large shlp
full offlowers, whlch has sunk. "</i>

1225
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:07,710
Stop it, Knut!

1226
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:14,593
<i>"Father Is shoutlng at me now
that he couldn't Ilve wlthout me. "</i>

1227
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:20,033
<i>- "And so the words meet. "
- Marie! Marie!</i>

1228
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,755
<i>"The letters I read today
say the same. "</i>

1229
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:29,670
<i>"The words meet after 40 years. "</i>

1230
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:47,268
Please kiss me, Marie.

1231
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,275
Let it be, Marie.

1232
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:12,391
I'm dying.

1233
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:36,754
<i>The wanderer has reached
the end of hls journey.</i>

1234
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,039
<i>It wasn't always easy
to keep up wlth you, my love.</i>

1235
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:49,873
<i>Sometlmes you had to walt for me.</i>

1236
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:53,072
And sometimes
I had to wait for you.

1237
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:58,599
At times we even lost track
of each other on the way.

1238
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:05,234
But somehow
we always found each other again.

1239
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:16,558
<i>Goodbye, my Knut.</i>

1240
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:20,309
<i>And thank you
for keeplng me company.</i>

1241
