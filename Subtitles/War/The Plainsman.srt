hundreds of thousands
of disbanded soldiers.

the country to save fiirst.

7
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,236
But these men
have saved their country.
Now the country must save them.

8
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,212
Their return home
in such great numbers
might paralyze industry...

9
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,684
by furnishing suddenly a greater
supply oflabor than for which
there could be a demand.

10

Mr. President.
Mr. Colfax.

11
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,056
I have read an editorial
in the Terra Haute Express...

12
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:16,585
written by Mr.John Soule,
in which he says, ''Go west, young man.''

room for all.

14
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,298
Gentlemen, our land
stretches from an Eastern sea
to a Western sea.

15
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:28,033
Surely, in that vast territory,
there is a place for men
to live and work and be happy.

16
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,837
Right,
Mr. President.
True, Mr. President.

17
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,574
I hope to attract our disbanded
soldiers to the hidden wealth
of our mountain ranges...

18
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,276
and to the wealth
that lies in the soil itself.

19
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,717
And to the grasslands
of the Great Plains.

20

the broken sod of Kansas,

21

of the West.

22
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,691
Yes, Mr. President,
but if only the frontier
could be made safe for the plow.

23
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,699
It must be made safe.

24
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,430

our settlers there.

Once we were the saviors
of our country.
Now we're outcasts.

37

Our money invested
in an unsalable product.

38

But a good product, gentlemen.

39
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,975
A new repeating rifle would have
made short work of the war...

40
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,040
had it been introduced earlier.

41
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,418
But now the subject of guns
is an unpopular topic...

42

to those who needed them
so badly a short while ago.

43
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,819
We'll have to look to Providence
for a market.

Providence? Where?

45
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:04,067
I've been told that the Indians
hunt with bow and arrow.

46
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,231
Still, they obtain furs,
valuable buffalo hides,

47

Dearie me.
Why shouldn't we be frank?

50
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,680
I have every reason
to believe the Indians
will pay $1 00 for each rifle.

51
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:25,690
A hundred dollars?
In furs. And a dollar a piece
for every cartridge.

52
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,919
But we can't sell rifles
to the Indians!

53
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,622
I think we can...
to peaceable Indians.

[ Man ]
But how--
For hunting.

55
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,926
They furnish us with furs.
We supply them with rifles.
Really quite simple.

56
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,768
Won't they use those guns
against white men?

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,970
We'll get the Indians
to promise not to do so.
I'm against this!

58
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:48,343
But why?
It's bound to make trouble
on the frontier.

59
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,882
President Lincoln says--
We have a perfect right
to do it.

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,441
Sheer nonsense.!
The army would stop us.

61

They control trade
with the Indians.
They did, my friend.

62
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,950
But Indian affairs
have been taken out
of the hands of the army...

63

a certain participation.
