The events will
happen all over again.

It, the same jungle, the
same paths, the same victims.

ahead to warn if there

00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,947
My fucking wife's
home waiting for me.

184
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:41,814
She's starving.

185
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,182
I feel like I'm gonna explode.

186
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,416
I can't take it anymore.

187
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,717
All right, take it easy, Mike.

188
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:46,819
Come on, rest a little.
No, no.

189
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:47,653
I gotta move.

190
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,588
It hurts less when I'm moving.

191
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:58,865
That's right.

192
00:29:58,965 --> 00:29:59,832
Cough it out.

193
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:00,799
You'll be all right.

194
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,270
I cough, man.

195
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,604
There's nothing in my system.

196
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,473
I haven't eaten in three days.

197
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,941
Mike, I thought you
kicked that shit.

198
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,144
Yeah, tell me about...
Tell me about it.

199
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,679
Yeah, I know, but what
do you want me to say.

200
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,780
I mean, look at you.

201
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,082
Hey, look at you.

202
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,884
Who the fuck are you to be
telling people how to live?

203
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,251
Hey, look, do what
the fuck you want.

204
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,186
You know, I personally
don't give a shit.

205
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:20,987
Wait.

206
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,122
I didn't mean that, man.

207
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,123
I'm sorry.

208
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,093
Let's walk.

209
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,394
Just do me a favor.

210
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,561
Don't pull any shit
with me around.

211
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,638
Have you seen Paco?

212
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,307
Yeah, I just saw him.

213
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,875
He's sure been looking for me.

214
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:43,910
He's looking for everybody.

215
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,211
He owns everybody.

216
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,947
At least his family does.

217
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,482
You know, he wouldn't be shit if
it wasn't for his brother, man.

218
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,518
That's the animal...
Animal to avoid.

219
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,752
I never met his brother.

220
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,786
Well, you're lucky.

221
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:55,888
[Inaudible] fucking
time of day, man.

222
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,656
He's a real fuck, you know that?

223
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,691
One time... one time this guy
was yelling at his brother, man.

224
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,427
I don't know, he got into
an accident or something,

225
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,594
Ran over his fucking toe.

226
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,395
Hey, wait.

227
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,796
There's somebody.

228
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:05,965
Hey, you want a
piece of this, man?

229
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,667
I'll split it with you.

230
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:09,468
No, Mike.

231
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,469
I'll pass.

232
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,270
You sure?

233
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,176
Mike, it's not the
way to do things.

234
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,344
You're gonna wind up in jail.

235
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,245
What choices do I have?

236
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,212
I'll take my chances.

237
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,847
I need $100 a day to survive.

238
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,215
Where am I gonna
get money like that?

239
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,850
You think I like doing this?

240
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:25,918
I'm better off in jail.

241
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,496
Mike, if I get any
money, I'll give you some.

242
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,956
[Baby crying]

243
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,787
[Screaming]

244
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:24,896
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
Sometimes I feel

245
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:29,368
Like I'm oozing out of my
body, like I don't belong here.

246
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:32,538
And my mind forces
me somewhere else.

247
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,508
I can't stop it because it's
so real that I believe it.

248
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,809
I hear it.

249
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,611
I smell it.

250
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,679
I can see it.

251
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,384
It's so fucking cold.

252
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,886
Oh, god.

253
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,389
Now I know why they
didn't kill me.

254
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,362
Dead?

255
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,398
What... but what
about other people?

256
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,032
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
There are no other people.

257
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,767
There's only room
for one at the top.

258
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,270
You remember that.

259
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,471
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): I don't

260
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,739
Know if I agree with that.

261
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,040
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
Well, you better

262
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,343
Agree with that, because
that's the way the world is.

263
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,944
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
But he's my friend.

264
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,145
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
I don't care.

265
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,147
You're not to associate
with his kind anymore.

266
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,782
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
What's his kind?

267
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,617
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
Cut it out.

268
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:52,618
You know what I'm talking about.

269
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,452
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): You can't

270
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,753
Judge everybody by their color.

271
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,087
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): Now,
don't tell me how to live.

272
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,823
You're not going to be seen
hanging around with niggers.

273
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,462
And you're being pig-headed.

274
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:04,863
You could be set for life.

275
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,031
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER): I
don't want to be set for life.

276
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:06,865
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
That's the most

277
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:07,999
Ridiculous thing I ever heard.

278
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:08,700
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): Why?

279
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,368
I don't want to do it.

280
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,636
I don't enjoy it.

281
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,772
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): Whoever
said life was enjoyable?

282
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,173
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): I don't care.

283
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,174
I'm gonna marry her.

284
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:16,975
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
You better care.

285
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,210
She's only after the money.

286
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,311
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
I don't have any money.

287
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,412
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
She wants my money!

288
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:20,979
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
That's bullshit.

289
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,348
She loves me.

290
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,815
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): You're
a fool, and she's using you.

291
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:27,686
Don't you ever talk
to me like that!

292
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,087
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): Oh, fuck you.

293
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:29,921
You're not my father.

294
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,323
You never were a father to me.

295
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,691
You're a piece of shit.

296
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,293
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): Don't
you ever talk to me like that!

297
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,296
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): I'll kill you!

298
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,664
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
I can no longer

299
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:44,002
Tell where one torture
ends and the next begins.

300
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,137
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): I'll
cut you off from everything!

301
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:46,938
You'll starve!

302
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:57,343
The

303
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,511
What do you got for me, Mike?

304
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,312
Something.

305
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,447
I got something good.

306
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,448
That's nice.

307
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:03,549
It makes business
so much smoother.

308
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:10,589
Here it is.

309
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:11,723
Wait a minute.

310
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:12,991
Let me see what you're
trying to pawn on me.

311
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,326
It's worth at least 100.

312
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,226
100?

313
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,161
Why not 1,000?

314
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:16,962
No, wait.

315
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,898
Let's make it 5,000.

316
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,132
What about a million?

317
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,601
It's worth at least that much.

318
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:23,869
Right, asshole?
Yeah, that's it.

319
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:24,670
It's worth a million.

320
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,471
It's a million.

321
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:26,738
Shut up.

322
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,374
What do you guys
provoke him for?

323
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,609
It only makes him worse.

324
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,444
This is costume jewelry, Mike.

325
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,479
It's paste.

326
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,413
It's shit.

327
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,382
It's worthless, you understand?

328
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:37,683
I'll give you $10 for it.

329
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:38,617
Give him a 60-bag.

330
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,051
No, come on, Paco.
I need the 100.

331
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:40,952
Come on, I'm good for it.

332
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,187
I swear.

333
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,288
Bullshit, you are.

334
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,590
I need the 100.

335
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,391
Come on, Paco.

336
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,291
I swear, I'll come back.

337
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,092
I'll get the money.

338
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,093
Come on.

339
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,562
You'll get the 100
when you get back.

340
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,363
Wait.

341
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,831
Here, take this.

342
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,801
Take this.

343
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,669
That's worth at least $40.

344
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,204
I can't accept that.

345
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,172
This is standard
police issue, man.

346
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,475
It can be traced anywhere.

347
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,111
What are you trying to do,
Mike, pin your crimes on me?

348
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,713
No, I swear.
Nothing.

349
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:08,547
No!

350
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:11,450
Down.

351
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,785
Look, from now on, with
you, it's cash on the line.

352
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,191
You know, Mike, with you,
there are always problems.

353
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,728
Everyone else is cool, but with
you, there's always a problem.

354
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,197
Do you have any
hardware I could use?

355
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,265
See what I mean?

356
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,000
Want us to inject
it for you too?

357
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,303
How about if I inject
it in your fucking face?

I can't constantly watch
them and do my own clients.

Why don't you get a babysitter
or something for them.

you're doing to that kid?

01:20:52,315 --> 01:20:54,683
What are we gonna eat?

905
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,886
What are we gonna do?

906
01:20:56,986 --> 01:20:58,821
My stomach hurts.

907
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,756
[Baby crying]

908
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:08,531
I can't take this anymore.

909
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:09,999
Shut up!

910
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:10,967
Shut up!

911
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:12,936
Damn you, shut up!

912
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:15,638
Why the hell don't
you do something?

913
01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:18,141
All you do is sit by
and watch us suffer!

914
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:58,181
MAN (ON TV): [chuckling]

915
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:00,483
What do you take me
for, Frankie, huh?

916
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,351
You think I'm one
of them out there.

917
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:05,554
You think you can tell me your
story, and I'll believe it.

918
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:07,890
Well, bullshit, motherfucker.

919
01:22:07,991 --> 01:22:10,359
You're a fucking liar, Frankie.

920
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,862
The only massacre you saw
was the one you started.

921
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:15,999
You were the one who went
crazy, not your squad.

922
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:20,269
You flipped out and shot
everybody, even your own men.

923
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:21,737
[Shouting]

924
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,241
MAN (VOICEOVER): He's firing!

925
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:26,242
I didn't give the
command to fire.

926
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:27,210
MAN (VOICEOVER): [inaudible].

927
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,211
He's gone crazy.

928
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:29,912
He's just shot two men.

929
01:22:30,013 --> 01:22:30,713
MAN (VOICEOVER): Dunlan!

930
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:31,914
Dunlan, cease fire!

931
01:22:32,015 --> 01:22:33,182
MAN (VOICEOVER): Frankie!
MAN (VOICEOVER): Dunlan!

932
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:34,183
Drop it!

933
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,152
Dunlan, no!

934
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:37,653
[Screaming]

935
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,156
MAN (VOICEOVER): Frankie!

936
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,125
Frankie, come back!

937
01:22:42,225 --> 01:22:43,626
You're going the wrong way!

938
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:18,121
[Dripping]

939
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:40,509
[Baby crying]

940
01:25:24,019 --> 01:25:25,421
[Gunshot]

941
01:26:03,926 --> 01:26:06,028
Cathy, I love you.

942
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:06,829
What?

943
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:13,302
[Gunfire]

944
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:36,759
Die!

945
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:37,760
Die, damn it!

946
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,666
It's not supposed
to be like this.

947
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:44,567
[Gunshot]

948
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:47,870
[Baby crying]

949
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,681
[Gunshot]

950
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:54,757
MAN: Open up in there.
This is the police.

951
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:55,658
I said open up in there.

952
01:29:55,758 --> 01:29:56,459
This is the police.

953
01:30:05,968 --> 01:30:07,069
[Gunshot]

954
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:20,883
There's something
blocking the door.

955
01:30:29,658 --> 01:30:33,529
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER): I go back
there every night without fail.
