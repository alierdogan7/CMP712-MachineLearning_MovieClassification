<i>(announcer)</i> The minister for tourism
said he expected tourism to recover

172
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,885

Cuba's democratic stability.

173
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,090
Three found hanged.

174
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,967
Three unknown boys were discovered
hanged in the Plaza de Armas.

175
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,848

- I'll take that for you.

176
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,250
- May I?
- No.

con un bigote que pasó por aquí?</i>

178
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,370
<i>No.</i>

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,049
You're required to register.

180
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,520
I want a room with water
which is sometimes hot.

181
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,246
If there's a bath to put it in,
I wouldn't mind.

182
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,046
Hello. Would you inform General Bello
that Major Dapes has arrived

183
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,640
and is at the Hotel Roma?

184
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,081
Yes, he knows who I am. Thank you.

185
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,851
- Do you have any luggage?
- Only what I'm carrying.

186
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,646
Without luggage
we require money to be paid in advance.

187
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,525
- How much?
- Whatever you care to give, sir.

188
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,204
No, no. No.
Well, you're bigger than I am.

189
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,609
- Mr President...
- I am not.

190
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,966
- We are holding an election for president.
- General Batista.

191
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,529
You can live in the security of the
United States with all your family, sir.

192
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,168
You have a house in Florida, sir.

193
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,330
All you have to do is get out, hand over
to the new president, whoever he is.

194
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,249
He will be Rivero Agüero.

195
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,370
- You gonna lift the arms embargo?
- Me? Us?

196

What do you want?

198
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,528
We are here
to investigate the financial affairs

199
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,042
of the Buró de Represión
de las Actividades Comunistas.

200
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,925
We may not be able to continue support.

201

<i>¿Preparado?</i>

202
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,328
Excuse me, I think there's a problem,
General Bello.

203
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,807
- I've lost the Englishman.
- Wait.

204
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,725
Nice one!

205
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,083
You better go find him.

206
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,885
I'm paying Dapes.
Get the police to bring him.

207
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,683
- Sir.
- Nice to see you.

Your bash, Vicar.

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,600
- Where's the phone in this room?
- In this room it's downstairs.

211
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,410
- It is untrue that I'm not a good worker.
- Yes.

212
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,249
It's her.

213
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,488
She has the right.

214
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,965
Go.

215
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,003
- You tell her...
- What?

216
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,851
That I will not go.

217
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,008
Have her come in here.

218
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,450
- There will be a strike if I go.
- Will there?

219
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,961
- Almost certainly.
- You will go.

220
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,802
There are accepted ways of behaviour
in Cuba still.

221
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,241
You can't fire me.

222
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,648
If you don't go, I will make you go.

223
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,603
How?

224
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,009
- What's that?
- He gave it to me.

225
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,290
It was my mother's.

226
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,289
Ramón! Some money.

227
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,166
I will buy it from you. I'm sure that
you consider that you have earned it.

228
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,851
No. He never should have given it to me.

229
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,963
200,000 bottles a day.

230
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,923
That's terrific.

231
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,202
Do you get to drink any of it?

232
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,811
Anyway, it all starts with the sugar.

233
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,083
With your permission, I'd like to show you.

234
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,085
My father, Don José Pulido, is one of
the wealthiest men on the island.

235
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,044
Rum, sugar, tobacco.

236
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,562
But we are quite separate
from the businesses run by my father.

237
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,251
I tell you this simply
so that you understand.

238
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,044
We don't need investment.

239
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,208
We, that is the cigar factory,

240
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,166
hope to encourage investment
so that we might expand.

241
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,284
- Would you like to meet my father?
- Yes, I would.

242
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,970
Ah!

243
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,607
- My father?
- Señor Pulido is very busy.

244
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,564
Tell him I'm here with a friend.
I'd like to introduce him.

245
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,409
- My card...
- He gave instructions...

246
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,251
- Tell him.
- Señor.

247
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,324
Your son would like to speak with you.

248
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,289
Father.

249
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,131
Might I introduce
Mr Gutman from New York?

250
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,971
You have met my daughter-in-law?

251
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,689
- I have. She's a very beautiful young lady.
- Yes, she is.

252
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,805
But my son is quite beautiful as well.
Handsome, charming. Like this pony.

253
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,007
- How do you like this pony?
- Very nice.

254
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,407
But I know nothing about horses.

255
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,171
Juan, how do you like this pony?

256
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,567
- It's good.
- Then I will buy it.

257
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,889
If there is one thing my son
knows about, it's horses.

258
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,002
It's the only thing he knows about,

259
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,727
which is why my daughter-in-law
runs my factory and Juan doesn't.

260
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
I hope he'll show you Havana.
It's wonderful.

261
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,206
He knows every casino,
every table and every bed in it.

262
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,961
He'd make an excellent travel guide.
As well as a jockey.

263
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,722
I'm not trying to insult my son.
I just want you to be aware of his talents.

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,527
And how much does one tip
the captain of police in Cuba?

340
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,486
- I usually give them all I've got.
- I see.

341
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,921
- Slightly less than New York.
- Yes.

342
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,845
Major.

343
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,042
Excuse me.

344
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,043
Major Dapes, General Bello.
General Bello, Major Dapes.

345
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,562
Major Dapes. Glad to meet you.
Sit down, please.

346
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,001
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

347
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,925
- You want to know something?
- Yes.

348
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,681
I guess I couldn't wait
until you got around to calling me.

349
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,167
I did call. I told them where I was.

350
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,444
That was very thoughtful of you,
but it was unnecessary.

351
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,131
- We would have found you.
- I wasn't hiding.

352
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,050
I'd decided
to make my own arrangements.

353
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,044
- Beretta.
- Yes.

354
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,447
- You buying or selling?
- Both.

355
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,530
- Major?
- No, thank you.

356
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,890
Major, how long were you in Malaya?

357
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,367
Oh, an awfully long time.

358
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,086
- Yes, I know.
- I imagine you do.

359
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,647
You want to know something?

360
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,491
I met a man, an American friend.

361
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,730
I told him that I wanted
the best counterterrorists I could find.

362
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,922
He told me that I have to buy British.

363
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,008
So here you are.

364
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,168
Bought.

365
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,808
You don't like money?

366
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,127
I don't like being without it.

367
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,802
- But you do like fighting, don't you?
- No, I don't like fighting at all.

368
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,810
- I try not to do too much of it.
- I do.

369
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,208
Have you done much?

370
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,886
Major, tell me what your favourite
weapon is and I'll get it for you.

371
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,680
- Brains.
- Brains. Yes.

372
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,765
You've got brains, right? Huh?

373
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,088
You see Ramírez here?

374
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,283
Ramírez is a junior officer.

375
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,243
He got brains.

376
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,011
Went to a military college.
They gave him brains.

377
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,169
With brains, very easy to get a promotion.

378
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,204
- We can make you a colonel.
- Thank you.

379
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,211
My friend Batista was a sergeant
until he got brains.

380
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,049
I was a corporal.

381
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,449
Then they had the revolution. The next
day I became a general with brains.

382
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,360
That's wonderful.
Some people stay corporals all their lives.

383
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,165
- Look at Hitler.
- Hitler... God rest his soul.

384
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,889
He was foolish enough to take on
Uncle Sam as well as the communists.

385
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,450
Yes. Right. That's the Second World War
in a nutshell.

386
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,566
- How are you going to do it?
- Do what?

387
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,762
- Beat Castro.
- Ah.

388
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,121
Minor factors can be taught in a month.

389
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,890
It's quite simple.

390
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,651
- Deny the enemy food, harry and kill him.
- What?

391
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,683
Harry and kill him.

392
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,243
Ambush him, rather than
wait for him to ambush you.

393
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,002
- OK. All right. What do you want?
- I need to see what you've got.

394
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,088
<i>(Ramírez) Perdóneme, señor.</i>

395
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,850
- Excuse me.
- General.

396
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,122
The parking meter detail.

397
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,283
- Did you get the money in England?
- Yes, thank you.

398
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,882
- I shall keep a record of my expenses.
- No, no.

399
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,571
Spend it. I want you to owe me.

400
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,765
Ramírez here is going to
show you a good time.

401
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,848
I want to hear you got to do everything.

402
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,122
If he slips up again, you tell me.

403
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,686
I'll take care of Ramírez in my own way.

404
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,521
Do you play golf?
What's your handicap? Have a cigar.

405
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,044
Major Dapes, I'm going to give you a pass

406
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,323
that will let you go anyplace
and see anything.

407
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,081
Only don't take too long, huh?
After all, we're fighting a war.

408
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,851
Yes, and rather badly I suspect, too.

409
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,802
See that Major Dapes
gets to harry and kill.

410
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,084
- There is something one ought to say.
- Say it.

411
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,923
You will only defeat someone like Castro
if you're right.

412
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,281
Is Castro right?

413
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,209
It's not the point.

414
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,288
Does Cuba think he's right?

415
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,726
When you're ready, Mr Dapes.

416
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,127
I expect to be called General.

417
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,210
It's important to call people
what they are, sir.

418
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,090
Major Dapes.

419
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,968
How do you work this?

420
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,971
- Marvin.
- Howdy.

421
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,321
- Ready to be beaten?
- You'll be lucky.

422
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,402
All right. All right.

423
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,766
- It's your day.
- It's straight set day.

424
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,848
- She's been practising.
- Oh, yeah?

425
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,928
Might put them off, huh?

426
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,927
- She's worked on her serve.
- She should have worked on her legs!

427
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,168
<i>¡Dos más! ¡Dos más!</i>

428
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,011
The boots are good.

429
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,169
Yes, Batista promised the army
good boots...

430
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,081
in 1934, when he was a revolutionary.

431
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,567
They wanted very little else then.

432
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,170
What do you say about
my on-court play now?

433
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,362
Tell me when you're gonna do that.

434
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,721
You know I can't get to it, Marvin.

435
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,320
Do you think I can mind-read?

436
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,367
Stay up at the net. And don't poach.

437
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,925
Alex.

438
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,607
- I knew it was you.
- Did you?

439
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,530
I'm Alejandra López de Pulido.

440
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,005
Excuse me. if you don't mind,
we're trying to play tennis.

441
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,964
Alejandra?

442
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,889
Alejandra!

443
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,969
I'd like to... No.

444
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,084
Better still, muster a patrol.

445
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,521
- Ten good men.
- Ten?

446
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,211
It will be almost impossible to find two.

447
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,368
Does that include you and me?

448
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,168
It isn't usual to go off the road.

449
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,886
Isn't it? No wonder you never
get to know anything.

450
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,129
It's the only way.
Get out, move amongst them.

451
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,321
Put your men on the paths
at five-yard intervals. All right?

452
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,126
Rafael, tell that idiot to shut up,
leave his nag behind and walk quietly.

453
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,368
<i>Apéate del caballo.</i>

454
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,245
You may tell my mother
that I am well, Núñez.

455
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,840
And give these to her.

456
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,248
Yes. Yes, you are well. Better, anyway.

457
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,091
We now eat more than one meal a day.

458
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,282
I am getting quite fat.

459
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,048
Bring Captain Ramírez.

460
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,128
<i>- ¡Jefe!</i>
- Shut up!

461
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,451
It's well used. How big is this plantation?

462
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,570
Some five miles.

463
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,331
<i>(Dapes)</i> if you're patient,
keep your sense of smell.

464
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,649
Sooner or later you'll pick up somebody
and they'll talk.

465
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,603
- Smell?
- Mm.

466
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,691
You can often smell a body of men
before you see them or hear them.

467
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,723
Especially if they're smokers.

468
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,451
Are you worried about
being late for the general?

469
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,040
He likes to show you off to his friends.

470
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,243
What happens if I don't show up?

471
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,169
Oh.

472
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,361
Hey!

473
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,926
Hold your fire!

474
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,324
<i>¡Vamos! ¡Por aquí!</i>

475
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,086
Stop or I'll shoot!
Do you understand English?

476
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,929
I teach it.

477
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,361
It's a girl.

478
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,370
- I want to question her.
- Yes.

479
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,960
First you, then she is questioned

480
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,562
by the sergeant and each of the men
as many times as possible,

481
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,207
and a few days later
she is taken down to La Cabana and shot.

482
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,641
It would be much kinder to shoot her now.

483
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,809
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just want to ask you...

484
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,206
Get down!

485
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,567
Women!

486
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,529
<i>¡Fidelistas!</i>

487
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,607
<i>¡Pare eso!</i>

488
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,168
Who is he?

489
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,004
Nobody.

490
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,851
Mr Gutman is in room 214.

491
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,765
What do you mean,
I'm not offering enough?

492
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,329
We are prepared to pay $10,000
for the whole goddamn operation.

493
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,408
Take it or leave it.

494
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,642
Right. Next, Skinner Air.

495
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,723
- What about some money?
- Hm?

496
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,764
- Money. Money.
- Do the bullets fit?

497
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,882
- What?
- Our guns.

498
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,402
Of course. They're 9mm,
which is what you asked for.

499
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,251
When we know they fit,
you'll be told and paid.

500
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,601
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

501
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,882
Shit!

502
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,605
<i>(woman) Mister...
SkinnerAirline is no answer...</i>

503
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,530
- Please take your shoes off.
<i>- Hello?</i>

504
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,168
<i>- Skinner no answer.</i>
- Will you ring Skinner Air again for me?

505
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,850
<i>Hello?</i>

506
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,962
Are you on the house, or do I chip in?

507
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,402
Everything is taken care of
by Señor Pulido.

508
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,330
I just have to show you a good time.

509
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,171
OK, we'll see what we can do.

510
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,731
Don't you Cubans realise
that time is money?

511
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,842
I do.

512
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,805
Guns?

513
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,129
Hm. Stored in the premises
of Alejandra Pulido.

514
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,289
- And is she involved?
- Perhaps.

515
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,086
Whether she is or not,
she still has to be questioned.

516
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,362
I used to know her in North Africa.

517
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,051
If she is involved,
I can find out very quickly.

518
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,401
Don't worry. I don't like terrorists.

519
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,648
Especially ones I know.

520
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,441
Come on, come on.

521
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,881
- Get me a cab.
<i>- Sí, señor.</i>

522
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,764
Come on.

523
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,922
- I've been promoted.
- Congratulations.

524
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,691
Batista has promoted
everyone in the army.

525
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,929
There are no privates any more.
Now I'm a major too.

526
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,441
I'll buy you a drink.

527
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,244
You know that the situation here
is not so good.

528
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,968
I think you've come too late.

529
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,768
I was afraid of that.

530
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,009
You know, soldiering has changed.

531
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,646
It's not as... clean as it was.

532
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,247
I'm still proud to be a soldier.

533
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,122
Why not? it's an honourable profession.

534
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,090
It was.

535
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,448
- Ready for another boring evening?
- It'll be fun. They always serve peas.

536
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,201
Sorry we're leaving, General,
but Mr Dulles is sending us home.

537
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,482
I know.

538
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,523
- Hello.
- We're not going far.

539
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:23,488
- But we may not be able to assist.
- It's OK. I've got an Englishman.

540
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,649
Oh, Don Pulido! Hello, my friend.

541

Sit down next to me.

543
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,971
All right, everybody. Please sit down.

544
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,846

00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,728
Major Dapes, I find the role of procurer
very distasteful to me.

684
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,765
- So if you don't like her, then...
- You don't like me?

685
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,803
But I am beautiful.

686
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:20,051
Yes, you are. it's just that
I try to avoid that which I cannot afford.

687
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,925
Oh! it's OK. You can afford.

688
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,726
Come. I take you to another casino
where I am very lucky for you.

689
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,242
I win you maybe
two and a half thousand dollars...

690
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,844
- We just bought some champagne!
- Yes, but you have not bought me.

691
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,971
Alex!

692
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,811
- I must talk with you.
- I don't want to talk to you.

693
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,002
- You were a long time ago.
- Alex!

694
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,285
Hey!

695
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,360
- Leave the soldiers alone.
- Rafael.

696
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,881
Mr Gutman. Shall we?

697
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,486
Miguel.

698
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,568

706
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,682
Robert.

707
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,810
I must tell you.

708
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,287
You could be in very serious trouble.

709
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,409
We must have a talk.

710
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,887
Yes, we must have many talks.

711
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,844
It is lovely to see you again. How are you?

712
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,611
I'm well. And you?

713
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,688
Fantastic.

714
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,284
- What sort of friends do you have here?
- Can't you do better than that?

715
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,368
Apart from your Wimbledon set.

716
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,610
I know. I'm sorry. You frightened me.

717
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,121
- But not now.
- I see.

718
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,891
What do you expect me to do now?
Kiss you?

719
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,922
I see no reason why you shouldn't.

720
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,327
It's been, as they say, such a long time.

721
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,725
Oh, stop it!
It seems like yesterday to me.

722
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,205
Really?

723
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,162
Would you excuse me a minute?

724
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,930
- Alex, about three hours ago...
- Robert.

725
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,681
- Did I ever know your second name?
- Of course you did!

726
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,247
- I did?
- You wrote to me. it got to me.

727
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,886
I can't have been
the only Robert in the army.

728
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,528
I should introduce you to my husband.
For that I need your second name.

729
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,007
- Juan, this is...
- Nobody?

730
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,886
Robert, for the life of me,
I can't remember your second name.

731
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,082
Dapes.

732
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,170
- My name is Robert Dapes.
- You must come and visit us.

733
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,330
Do you play polo? Would you like
to meet anyone in the government?

734
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,411
If there's enough money involved,
you can meet Batista himself.

735
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,008
What line of business?

736
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,967
Tractors!

737
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,487

738
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,211

Come on, get up.

740
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,128
You, too. Up!

741
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,404
- Aimed at you?
- Yes. At me.

742
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,764
Do you know that young man?

743
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,408
Good heavens, no.
I wouldn't even recognise him again.

744
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,327
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Good enough.

745
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,371
Then you are in for a very long night.

746
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,088

749
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,890
- About those that have been arrested.
- Hear what?

750
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,728
Major, please.

751
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,722

752
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,202
Thank you.

753
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,769
They just can't account for $300,000
for the month of June, Spence.

754
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,521
I have some very suspicious
cross-entries here, Gary.

755
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,802
We're gonna be here for months.

756
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,491
These accounts are in a mess.

757
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,883
Well, they are experiencing a revolution.

758
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,571
I guess accounts do get out of hand.

759
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,608
No luck.

760
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,371
Thank you.

761
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,326
- Teresa, what are you doing here?
- My brother could kill you.

762
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,488
He's already tried.

763
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,727
Wait here, huh? Just wait.

764
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,808
Where's your wife?

765
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,689
Robert!

766
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,565
Your husband was released
some hours ago.

767
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,527
Yes, I know.

768
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,048
Come on.

769
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,130
Do you want to say something?
Or would you rather not?

770
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,130
Yes. I would rather not.

771
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,001
Why were you so upset at the tennis?

772
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,089
Yes, I was. You frighten me.

773
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,170
Because you threaten
to change the life I have.

774
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,248
How would I do that?

775
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,044
You already have.

776
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,128
I knew you would.

779
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,362
Can't we just drive around
for a little while?

780
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,720
What have you been doing?

781
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,128
Living in Cuba. You?

782
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,163
Modern warfare.

783
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,001
Fighting people who hide grenades
in shopping baskets,

784
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,487
shoot up crowded hotels,

785
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,002
hack the legs off cattle
and leave them dying on their stumps.

786
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,485
That sort of thing.

787
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,843
- Your friends...
- I have very few friends.

788
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,964
Do they toss bombs around,
shoot off guns?

789
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,242
No. You do that.

790
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,569
- Rafa!
<i>- Sí.</i>

791
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,401
Take the posters down.
Put them on the truck at the back.

792
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,009
Are you married?

793
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,727
No. But you are.
That should be enough for both of us.

794
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,568
We're very happy.

795
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:21,402
I seem to remember, when I was once
deeply and ridiculously in love,

796
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,921
I was at the same time
profoundly unhappy.

797
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,164
That was me.

798
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,523
I did that to you. I made you unhappy.

799
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,087
- I adored it.
- I didn't.

800
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,480
Am I still beautiful? You used to think so.

801
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,241
I seem to remember
you were very taken with me.

802
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,728
As a matter of fact,
you were terrified that I was.

803
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,606
You got out of North Africa
faster than Rommel.

804
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,601
- Actually, he took his time.
- Admit it. I terrified you.

805
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,681
Yes, I admit it. I didn't know so much
passion could exist in one so young.

806
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,170
You were the most exotic,
breath-stopping creature I'd ever known.

807
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,521
Quite a danger to my health.

808
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,009
What with you and my colonel and
being shot at, I'm astonished I survived.

809
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,761
- Perhaps you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

810
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,326
By forgetting all about you.

811
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,807
And how did you recognise me?

812
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,367
You didn't forget me.
You knew me at once.

813
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,244
Yes, I did.

814
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,807
And you haven't changed at all.

815
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,129
I hate coming to these filthy places.

816
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,811
I like these places.

817
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,561
I like you and I like places like this.

818
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,088
I used to bring someone else here.

819
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,330
- Who? You don't still bring her?
- Good heavens, no.

820
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,568
She's my wife.

821
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,761
- When did you marry Juan Pulido?
- Five years ago.

822
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,247
- Any children?
- No.

823
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,250
He doesn't beat you,
or anything dreadful like that?

824
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,285
- What would you do if he did?
- Break his bloody neck.

825
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,765
- Would you?
- Of course.

826
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,524
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

827
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,166
- Egg flip?
- There may be something wrong with me.

828
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,328
Apart from your memory?

829
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,126
I might be too ambitious. Too demanding.

830
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,441
In fact, I am.

831
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,050
Tell me this...

832
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,881
The only question you haven't asked me
is why I came to meet you.

833
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,401
Why did you come?

834
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,726
Look out!

835
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,088

01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,048
And you were seen.
You can't stay on campus, Julio.

856
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,440
I've got to. I can't flunk my courses.

857
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,245
It doesn't matter.
There'll be no more courses.

858
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,648
Now Agüero is elected,
there will be a general strike.

859
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,841
Here.

860
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,046
Here.

861
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,970
If you want to kill someone.

862
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,681
<i>(girl)</i> The trigger mechanism jammed.
Take the .38.

863
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,881
- Did you vote for him?
- No. Nobody did.

864
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,811
- Somebody must have done.
- Batista, who pays you.

865
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,605
No, I'm paid by General Bello.

866
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,802
Just as good.
You can be sure of your money.

867
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,164
Bello works the parking meters.
Batista pockets the lottery.

868
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,805
Don't you worry
about where your money's from?

869
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,403
If what you say is true,
it appears I come under "traffic of fences".

870
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,090
It's true.

871
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,964
You don't get involved in any of this, hm?

872
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,687
No, I don't look too closely
at things that don't concern me.

873
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,529
Like having your factory used.

874
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,690
Robert, in Cuba every building,
every factory, every hotel

875
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,531
is being used in some way by someone.

876
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,008
There are things I know nothing about,
I don't turn stones over,

877
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,329
and so far my workers
have not had a strike.

878
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,966
Even a blind eye can be poked out.

879
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,850
Alex...

880
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,849
I want you to come with me.

881
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,200
Where?

882
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,005
Where? You haven't thought about it?

883
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,761
It's only just being suggested to me.
Where?

884
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,325
With me.

885
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,601
Far?

886
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,520
- Don't play games.
- It's very short notice.

887
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,850
I don't see you for 15 years,
you turn up as if yesterday and say...

888
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,409
No. I can't go anywhere with anyone
on short notice.

889
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,047
I own a factory, and I do have a husband.

890
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:29,006
He would have to be told if I was
going anywhere, short notice or not.

891
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,441
I'm not asking you to go on a holiday!

892
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,528
Don't shout.

893
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:41,846
Robert, it's very nice of you,
and I know what you're saying.

894
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,124
But I don't really know you, do I?

895
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,641
You knew me when I was a silly girl of 15.

896
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,321
- 17.
- 15.

897
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,410
Who fell in love with
a handsome British soldier.

898
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,683
Do you know what I remember most
about you? Your knees.

899
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,848
You're being ridiculous.

900
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,010
I'm not. I'm trying to prevent you
from being ridiculous.

901
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,126
You're obviously not happy
with your husband.

902
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,369
- How do you know?
- Because you wouldn't allow me to...

903
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,086
I didn't allow you to anything.

904
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,601
- I made love to you.
- Very nice it was too.

905
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,165
- Yes.
- So?

906
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:22,080
- So... nothing.
- Nothing?

907
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,722
Nothing. Robert, please try to understand.

908
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,684
I have a house. I enjoy having it.

909
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:35,091
I enjoy having a husband who is a
member of a very important Cuban family.

910
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,851
- It's important to me.
- Rubbish!

911
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,042
Don't speak to me like that.

912
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,845
You're talking about things.
Factories, houses.

913
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,122
- Husbands.
- He means nothing to you.

914
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:50,007
How do you know what Juan means to me
or has meant to me? You don't.

915
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,010
If he means something to you,
you shouldn't be here.

916
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,327
- Don't pick that up.
- Don't shout.

917
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:05,287
- Then pick this up as well.
- I don't know what you're playing at.

918
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,291
- You're unhappy. You won't let me...
- Don't you have a job to do?

919
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,282
I'm going to do my job.

920
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:18,124
- Then I'll see you sometimes.
- No, you won't.

921
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,202
- I see.
- What did you say?

922
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,130
I said I see!

923
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,527
I'm buggered if I do.

924
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,211
<i>Quédate. Dame las llaves.</i>

925
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,648
<i>(Gutman yawns)</i>

926
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,246
Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop!

927
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,203
- Good morning.
- Get out. I'm not hungry.

928
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,368
I'm starving.

929
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,525
Oh. <i>(chuckles)</i>

930
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:50,167
Well... had a good night?

931
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,770
<i>(police whistle)</i>

932
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:55,168
- Like to buy an aeroplane?
<i>- (gunshots)</i>

933
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,922
Not there, old man. it's outside.
The whole of Havana's on strike.

934
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:03,203
Not the whole, not yet,
but it won't be long.

935
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,570
I had to walk up.
The elevator's out of action.

936
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,287
There you are, you see. Power cut.

937
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,281
Now, then, let's talk about my aeroplanes.

938
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,210
- How much?
- How much can you offer?

939
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,881
- They ain't worth nothing.
- They're going to be worth a great deal.

940
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,321
People are going to want to get out.

941
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,887
And they'll want to take out
their goods and chattels.

942
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,242
- Have you got a car?
- Yes, a pick-up.

943
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,806
Even better. Here's what I'll do.

944
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,050
I'll buy your aircraft, I'll buy the cigars.
We'll get the cigars out.

945
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,482
I'll buy the Pulido place.
We'll make a delivery today.

946
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,681
What is the world gonna need?
Havana cigars, right?

947
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,490
<i>(woman) Radio Rebelde.
Rebel Radio. Why?</i>

948
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,648
<i>Why has Agüero been elected?</i>

949
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,967
<i>You did not vote. You stayed at home.</i>

950
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,766
<i>But Agüero was elected because
the election was rigged by Batista.</i>

951
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,282
<i>What can you do? You can strike.
A general strike is called</i>

952
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:07,440
<i>This is the voice of revolution from the
men and women fighting for a free Cuba.</i>

953
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,528
<i>The end is near. Very near.</i>

954
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,689
<i>Batista soldiers are moving against us
but cannot win.</i>

955
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,406
<i>They will be defeated by us and by you.</i>

956
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,002
<i>Strike. No telephones, no transport,
no work in the factories.</i>

957
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,724
<i>Support the revolution.</i>

958
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,481
<i>Tell us, Batista,
are you leaving now or later?</i>

959
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,921
<i>We know you have
five aircraft standing by</i>

960
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,681
<i>for those pimps, pushers, prostitutes
who are faithful to you.</i>

961
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,644
<i>Tell us, Sergeant Batista...</i>

962
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,161
Jesús promised me
there would be no strike.

963
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,408
Where is Jesús?

964
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,404
<i>(woman) ¡María, vámonos!</i>

965
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,568
<i>(phone rings)</i>

966
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,808
<i>(plays gentle classical music)</i>

967
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,923
<i>Dígame.</i>

968
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,963
Ah, Ramón.

969
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,001
I think we've got a...

970
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:28,681
Very well, I will go to the rum factory first
and then I will come to you.

971
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,604
And, Ramón, lock up everything
and remove the money.

972
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,161
Everybody throughout Cuba
has stopped work.

973
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,204
That is apart from servants, of course.

974
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:53,767
- I phoned Señor Pulido and...
- You had no right to do that, Ramón.

975
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,803
I can handle this.

976
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,923
<i>Calma.</i>

977
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,804
Your husband was shot this morning.

978
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,967
He lasted a long time.

979
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,048
Yes, he did.

980
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,087
I must tell Julio.

981
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,367
<i>(angry shouting)</i>

982
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,727
Go on.

983
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,044
Go on!

984
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,848
Go on.

985
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,967
<i>¡Guerrillero!</i>

986
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,084
Keep your stupid old mouth shut, woman,
do you hear?

987
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,565
We're fighting for you.

988
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,971
One thing I'm certain. She's not involved.

989
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,604
What's the drill?

990
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:50,089
Try to get her as far away from the factory
as possible, before anything happens.

991
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,966
Old man Pulido should be told.
He will be able to help.

992
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,805
<i>¡Ven! ¡Ven! ¡Más! ¡Más!</i>

993
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,245
<i>¡Todo el mundo, fuera!</i>

994
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,803
Follow me!

995
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,809
<i>¡Sigan! ¡Sigan!</i>

996
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:16,771
Line them up! Line them up!

997
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,042
<i>¡Vale! ¡Vale!</i>

998
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,326
Next. <i>¡Arriba las manos!</i>

999
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,528
Nothing, eh? Next.

1000
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,808
<i>¡Levanta la barrera!</i>

1001
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,842
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1002
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,687
Over there!

1003
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,687
- Why were they shot?
- They tried to escape.

1004
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,564
- From what?
- From being shot.

1005
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:18,526
- How did they know they were rebels?
- They tried to escape.

1006
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,210
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes.

1007
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,527
- Are you a rebel?
- If I try to escape.

1008
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,881
Wasn't it the same in Malaya?

1009
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,810
- No, it wasn't.
- You're here to teach us.

1010
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,091
<i>(man)</i> I am not working...

1011
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,249
- it's over, master.
- You're meant to be in charge!

1012
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,284
<i>¡Huelga!</i> Down with him!

1013
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,085
- Who dared to allow...
- They dared to.

1014
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,601
- What will you do?
- Me? Nothing.

1015
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,770
I'm here merely
to take your leavings, Father.

1016
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,965
Your houses, your old factories,
your old mistresses.

1017
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,681
How dare you talk about
your wife in that way.

1018
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,761
You would think he'd be the last drunkard
that will ever be in Cuba. Look at him!

1019
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,280
You load the truck, I'll go do the deal.

1020
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,970
Um...

1021
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,684
But sure...

1022
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,685
What is this, Labor Day?

1023
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,644
Go on.

1024
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,968
Señora Pulido!

1025
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:48,402
Just name the price, I'll buy the works.

1026
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:53,048
The factory, every goddamn cigar you got.
It's no problem.

1027
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:58,087
This very day I intend to fill a plane
full of your cigars and fly to Miami.

1028
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,885
All you gotta do is tell me how much.

1029
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:07,002
You can stay here and run the factory
for me until the whole shoot collapses.

1030
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,361
All I want is two planeloads a day.

1031
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:12,211
- I bought the trucks, the planes...
- Mr Gutman.

1032
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,164
There's a man behind you with a gun.

1033
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,209
<i>(cocks gun)</i>

1034
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,410
<i>(cocks gun)</i>

1035
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,171
Oh, dear. Um...

1036
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,203
<i>(rapid gunfire)</i>

1037
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:45,561
- Agh!
- Shh! Quiet!

1038
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,563
- I will shoot this woman.
- I don't doubt that you will.

1039
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,484
Search him.

1040
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,008
Search him!

1041
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,604
- With this you can go anywhere?
- Can you read?

1042
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,609
I read law at university.

1043
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,724
I'm not in the least surprised.

1044
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,526
You can't use it without me.
There's a bad likeness stuck to it.

1045
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,121
- You'll come.
<i>- (Jesús)</i> Where?

1046
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,447
- Load the guns.
- Where are you going?

1047
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,291
- To Santa Clara, to Fidel.
- They are for the city.

1048
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,164
We were told to wait here.

1049
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:47,363
- I'm taking them to Castro! You come too.
- Ah!

1050
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:52,407
So you can say "I was a Fidelista"
before it is too late for Fidel to notice you.

1051
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,560
I shoot her first if any of you try anything.

1052
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,242
Put the guns in the truck
and cover them with cigars.

1053
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,327
Get up.

1054
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,451
Is there enough fuel to get me to Miami?

1055
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,324
<i>- Sí, señor.</i>
- Right.

1056
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,968
- But the water dump tanks are full.
- Doesn't matter. I'll drop it out on the way.

1057
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:39,323
Have a... whatever you drink.

1058
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,966
<i>¡Gracias, señor!</i>

1059
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,082
You're driving very badly.

1060
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,407
Perhaps you're not used to driving
such an expensive car.

1061
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,010
Perhaps.

1062
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,090
Why are you fighting
for a country that's not yours?

1063
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:14,161
I will fight for any elected government
that makes me an offer for my services.

1064
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,651
Would you fight for someone
who paid you more?

1065
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,845
No, I would never fight with a gun
to overthrow a legitimate government.

1066
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,209
So you decide
which governments are legitimate?

1067
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,970
Wonderful.

1068
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,287
<i>(distant gunfire)</i>

1069
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,083
<i>(Gutman)</i> Oh, God. Guerrillas.

1070
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,481
<i>- Dame.</i>
- No, but...

1071
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,525
<i>- El arma. Sí.</i>
- I'm...

1072
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,724
<i>(Bello)</i> They will come out at us
from the cane fields.

1073
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:03,084
I told Batista our soldiers were too tired
and did not want to fight.

1074
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,443
- That is a fair assumption.
- We'll see.

1075
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,282
We must hold on to the gasoline depot.
We must not lose that.

1076
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,607
- Have you any interest in oil?
- Yes...

1077
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:16,166
I am going to speak to Castro.

1078
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:20,922
I will say to him "You got to get rid of
the communists in your army."

1079
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,169
"if you don't make a deal,
I'm going to harry and kill."

1080
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,443
- Harry and kill. You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.

1081
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:46,327
<i>(train brakes screech)</i>

1082
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,928
We're full. Switch the flow onto six.

1083
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,646
- What?
- Switch the flow onto six.

1084
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,282
Juan, take a look at this. Come here.

1085
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,610
Get up! Come on!

1086
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,088
<i>- ¡Por favor!</i>
- Get up!

1087
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,201
<i>(woman) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.
Probando.</i>

1088
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,971
<i>Here we go.</i>

1089
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,328
If Batista's soldiers wish to surrender,
they will be well treated.

1090
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:08,604
I repeat,
if Batista's soldiers wish to surrender,

1091
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,802
they will be well treated.

1092
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,766
It is not a disgrace
to surrender to your own revolution.

1093
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,531
There is no honour in living a lie.

1094
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:21,964
If you die now,
you will at least die a free man.

1095
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,048
Come home. Come to us.

1096
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,640
We are you, you are us.

1097
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,167
Stand still where you are and listen.

1098
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:39,480
When you take prisoners who have fought
for the revolution, you shoot them.

1099
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,487
We, however, do not intend to shoot you.

1100
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,925
You will be released, handed over to the
Cuban Red Cross and returned home.

1101
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,804
Those who are criminals,

1102
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:58,847
guilty of crimes of torture, murder,
you know who you are.

1103
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,760
You may hide, but you'll be found.

1104
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,250
The depot!

1105
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:09,684
Tell the tanks that the gasoline depot
is swarming with Fidelistas.

1106
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,485
<i>(radio) Chambelona Red? Over.</i>

1107
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,523
I hear you. Over.

1108
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,369
Major Dapes.

1109
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,925
That's right.

1110
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,441
- You said he was to be killed.
- Be quiet.

1111
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:25,202
<i>This is Colonel Leyva.
You are to attack the gas depot Over.</i>

1112
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,368
Chambelona Red.

1113
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,409
- Major, you are a paid soldier.
- Of course I'm bloody well paid.

1114
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,090
We're not paid.

1115
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:38,328
- You're not soldiers.
- OK.

1116
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:42,161
But though we aren't soldiers,
we're fighters.

1117
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,728
And we are winning.

1118
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:55,482
- We'll send the <i>Yanquis</i> home.
- I can't wait.

1119
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,410
We'll fight the parasites
that feed on the people.

1120
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,205
The Church, gangsters, soldiers.

1121
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,766
Soldiers are the worst parasites.

1122
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,929
- Don't talk to him. Kill him.
- We're not killing anyone.

1123
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,249
- I'll kill him.
- Would you care to try without a gun?

1124
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,328
- Give me that!
- No!

1125
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,965
I brought guns to you!

1126
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,289
We did need guns,
but now we need brains.

1127
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,209
You go away and rediscover yours.

1128
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:34,330
It isn't easy to be given a gun.
We make it a privilege.

1129
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,762
What do you intend doing
about thugs like him?

1130
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,805
It might be more to the point
to ask what they intend to do about us.

1131
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,769
Get down!

1132
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,364
Gutman, you can drive a car.
Then you can drive a tank.

1133
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,608
<i>(Gutman)</i> No. What are you doing?

1134
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,371
You want to go home? Then come on!

1135
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,691
Pull it back! Come on!

1136
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,928
Come on! Get out!

1137
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,606
Hey! Look out!

1138
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,928
Come on!

1139
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,281
- It's just the same as a car.
- But mine's automatic.

1140
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,404
Where's the goddamn wheel?

1141
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,243
What are you doing?

1142
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,124
- Pull on the sticks!
- What?

1143
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,481
<i>This is Colonel Leyva.
Do you hear me? Over.</i>

1144
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,007
- Got him!
- Who?

1145
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,364
Get us off the road!
There's another one coming!

1146
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,687
- Stick!
- Pull the left lever!

1147
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,928
- Stick!
- Yes!

1148
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,288
I can't see anything.

1149
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,845
Keep it going.

1150
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,883
You're over-revving.

1151
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,168
Change gear!

1152
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,168
You're flooding it!

1153
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,760
Can I help?

1154
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:18,728
Make bandages out of this. That way
you won't ruin your nails, sweetheart.

1155
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,046
Pull! Pull!

1156
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,324
Pull! Pull!

1157
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:01,761
Come on, move! Get us going.

Quickly! Hurry up!

1170
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:08,722

We've done it, Spence.
I never thought we would.

1179
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,168
- We got them to balance.
- Sure have.

1180
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,569
Do you want to go out
and see something of Havana now?

1181
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,523
Sure.

1182
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,328
Take the other one! This one's mine!

1183
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:11,091
OK, but quick. Bello might come back!

1184
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,928
Quick, let's go!

1185
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,885
Pack your things as quickly as you can.

1186
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,688
It'll take time to clear you with the British
Consulate and arrange your ticket.

1187
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,280
I'll send the car back from the airport.

1188
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,483
Where has she been, my wife?

1189
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,648
With you?

1190
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,369
Yes. She's been with me.

1191
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:49,644
- Am I expected to take her back?
- No, you're bloody well not.

1192
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,411
- Where are you taking her?
- Out of Cuba.

1193
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,681
Why?

1194
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,928
Cuba won't change.

1195
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:00,682
A few people will leave. My father
will go away for a while, so will Batista,

1196
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,451
and then they will both come back.

1197
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:08,407
And once again Batista will get his face
on the front of <i>Time</i> magazine.

1198
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,845
Whatever you say, I want her out of here.

1199
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,846
Stop talking about me as if I'm not here.

1200
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,281
Robert, you don't understand.

1201
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:23,166
I don't want to leave Cuba. Ever again.

1202
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:30,165
I regard those years spent away
as lost time.

1203
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:33,887
There was nothing,
and I include you, Robert,

1204
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,001
nothing that made them memorable.

1205
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,566
No, I cannot go with you.

1206
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,569
Stay here with me.

1207
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:57,124
Robert,
I know what I've done to you and me.

1208
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:03,049
But if you take me away from here,
I wouldn't seem the same to you.

1209
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,889
- You don't understand, do you?
- You're right I don't understand.

1210
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,163
I don't understand you or him
or his father or even myself,

1211
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,681
sitting here bloody well discussing...

1212
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,926
Hey!

1213
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,603
Get in.

1214
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,808
I'll send the car back.

1215
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:27,490
It's up to you.

1216
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:39,726
What do you think will happen to you?

1217
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,161
Mind your own business, señor.

1218
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:46,729
Thank you. That seems
a perfectly reasonable reply, chum.

1219
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,284
It's not like you to be so unselfish.

1220
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,244
It's not like you to notice.

1221
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,684
Where are the keys to the sports car?

1222
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,201
In the car. Where are you going?

1223
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,402
For a drive.

1224
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,249
You will be back?

1225
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,282
